2,No real difference in seats,"I followed the directions and washed my two tan leather front seats in my expedition. The cleaner has enough foaming and moisture to clean, but just didn't get much clean beyond the basic surface that water would have done just as well.My leather has tiny lines all through it, and even with a scrub brush gently cleaning, none of then got very clean.I think this product is designed for gentle cleaning of the leather surface, for those who perhaps get some food on their seats, and not for deep cleaning."
3,OK but not so good on bright leather!,I used it mainly for my car that had beige leather. The results were not all so inpressive!
2,Overrated,Did not get the gray dirt off my leather in my car. Disappointed in this product. I followed instructions but black dirt stains still there.
2,Don't waste your money,"I have since learned from several people/professionals I trust that good leather doesn't require a special cleaner. Just a damp cloth and mild soap. You should condition your leather about once a year though (Lexol makes a conditioner which did come recommended).FWIW, the first bottle I got broke at the neck in the packaging and it was a breeze to exchange it for a new one."
2,Did not make a difference,"I used both the cleaner and the conditioner as described but they did not make a difference on decent looking leather seats in my 2003 Sienna. If they made a difference I have not realized it.I do not regret buying these, I hope they will add to the life of the leather seats even though I have not observed a change in appearance."
4,Works as advertised.,Product worked on my leather couches as advertised with no ill effects. There were no unpleasant fumes to contend with and my coaches came out looking cleaner. I followed the cleaning with Lexol's leather conditioner as recommended.
1,Doesn't work.,Tried cleaning a sweat stained leather had.Had no luck with this product. Hat looks just the same. :-( :-(
3,"Its ok, not so great","Very easy to clean, but I don't see anything special in it, may be because I'm not so knowledgeable about leather."
1,Does nothing for my car. Returned.,"I got this Lexol Leather pH Cleaner Spray offline at a local auto parts store...and I am glad I did.I start cleaning my car and the first thing I notice is the citrus smell. Suddenly half through cleaning the passenger front seat the sprayer broke. At this point the white cleaning rag I was using was still white and given I had not cleaned the seats in months I just returned it.So I went online and after much research orderedGriot's Garage 11259 Leather Care Spray Kit. Well, the Griot cleaner cleaned old grime of the leather seats I had cleaned with the Lexol cleaner a week earlier.I have used a variety of leather cleaners over the years and in my experience this one does absolutely nothing."
3,about the same as other leather cleaners,"I have a white sofa which, i must admit, is not as white as it used to be. It's a 3 year old couch which has only been cleaned once or twice (using a different leather cleaner). I bought this product hoping this would get my sofa to be pure white again but sadly, it didn't have much of an effect. It did make the sofa a little bit whiter but it would probably take many applications for me to get it back to its prime."
1,No excuse,The book has potential but the editor must have relied exclusively on the electronic spell checker. I became more interested in finding the editing errors than reading the book. It is inexcusable to have so many editing errors in a book.
1,Left Field,Another deep thinker creating his own answers rather than staying with biblical fact. Too bad.
1,what a hopeless piece of crap,read through the other 1 star reviews. They've said it all.amazon should give the opportunity to give minus points. preferable minus 10 points.sometimes actors should say NO during the making of a movie when they see things are going bad. I mean was everybody fast asleep and didn't they realize this was not going too great?
3,A light hearted love story.,"Despite many reviews to the contrary, I really enjoyed this movie. I don't expect it to live up to the comparisons to movies like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and I guess that's why I like it so much. It never fails to bring out the romantic wishful thinking in me. Maybe I find the lack of depth in the characacters interesting because I know so many people like them. Maybe I'm not disappointed because I watch movies to be entertained and escape from my own life, not to change the world. If you like slightly sappy movies about finding your true love you'll like ""Til There Was You""."
1,YUCK,"There are so many things wrong with this movie it is hard to know where to start. The sub-plot where the characters are attempting to preserve the historic apartment complex is resolved in the most unsatisfying way possible. The heroine's parents' story is also cringe worthy. The movie seems to be both promoting and simultaneously mocking the notion of a ""one true love"" that makes everything else meaningless. It does not pull it off and instead seems merely ridiculous. Run if you see this movie coming!"
2,melodrama at its worst,"I give this film two stars to correct for any Old-Man-Grumpus factor that may be clouding my judgment. I'm all for corny love stories, but this one is so poorly done, so weakly directed and sappily planned, that I could hardly keep my popcorn down. The plot is one gigantic contrivance that loses its charm in the first quarter of the film. I recommend some other movie, just about any any other movie, over this one."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen,"This movie is stunningly bad. It is hard to say which is worse: the plot, the screenplay, or the acting. If I had to pick, it would be the acting. The fact that there are some good reviews of this movie only proves that there are some people who like every movie, no matter how bad it is. It is bad beyond belief. The other reviewer is right, that even Sarah Parker is rendered into something awful by the director. You know how some movies ""transport"" you into another world? Well, this one transports you into an awful world of dismal movies that should not have been made. There is nothing redeeming about this film. Save yourself two hours by avoiding it."
1,til there was... phew!,"Dear Ms. Parker, I've noticed that in your work, you've got the dumb blonde character down cold. Could we get some acting mixed in too?Dear Ms. Tripplehorn, I think I owe you an apology. ""Waterworld"" was not your worst acting in a film.Dear Mr. McDermott, ""Practice"", please.Dear Ms. Aniston, You're great at playing a ""friend"". Could your next character have a point?Dear Ms. Ebersole, So what?Sincerely, Ciccone4"
4,Prima! Es war spitze!,"Die Prinzen is a great group whose acapella CDs are the best. Their voices make it sound like backgroung instrumental musik, it is really cool. They are very easy to understand, even with only a minimal amount of deutsch. I highly recommend it to anyone, especially beginners."
4,perfect for Eagle Scout ceremony,"With a grandson recently receiving his Eagle Boy Scout award, these cookies were perfect for the reception.This cutter is lightweight, not surprising given its low cost, but wish it was a little sturdier."
5,so amazingly american goodness!,"so awesome! i bought this cookie cutter because i traveled all over the world and AMERICA is the BEST! SO I CAME HOME TO AMERICA AND VOWED TO ONLY EAT AMERICAN DESSERTS AND COOKIES SO IT WAS NATURAL THAT I WOULD BUY THIS COOKIE CUTTER. If you dont like eagle cookies, then you are a freedom hater! i recommen this to EVRYONE!"
5,The best book of its kind that we've found,"We stock this in our career center for our students and it is almost always one of the most requested books. This book is a good starting point for students who ""want to do something international"", but who are just trying to figure out what that means. The chapters introductions by ""international professionals"" are especially useful."
4,Better Than I Expected,"I expected this book to be an overview of the international affairs field, but it proved to be much more. The careers and paths available are well-written and -described, and there are a number of careers that, although not obvious, suit people with an interest in international affairs well. In addition, companies, government organizations, and NGO's that employ people in international affairs are listed along with contact information. It's a well-rounded book that is honest about both the upsides and downsides of each career."
4,a very good guide to those who don't know IR,this book is a great guide to 1- students planning to study IR and 2- IR graduates who are loking for a career in this field and 3- IR graduates who don't know what to do with their diploma !!!
4,"INTERESTING, ORIGINAL, WEIRD, BUT IS IT KLEZMER?","I thought that the range of styles and genres was impressive and unexpected. The humor of the group and its creativity in improvising and reinterpreting familiar pieces were interesting and provocative. My reactions to the pieces was varied, though I thought there was consistency in the level of performance and emotional engagement of the musicians. Overall a unique experience."
2,Time intensive cutting and gluing for assembly,"Time intensive cutting and gluing of small pieces. Frustration level of trying to get all the little pieces to stay together with glue overshadowed the learning. My daughter loves Egyptian history, but became bored with this kit because of the time involved in putting the canopic jars and cat mummy together. Would have been much better if kit had come with premade canopic jars (or something easier to assemble.)"
2,Boring!,I'm not sure how this product could have been made to be more interesting. My 13-year-old sat down and put the whole thing together in about 20 minutes. That was easy enough but the cost of the kit was far too expensive for a plastic doll and some gauze wrapping.
2,Wished it were made better,This looked so promising! We bought this to go with our study of Ancient Egypt. The jar tops were good but the jars themselves were just paper that you had to cut out and glue together. They were so small and hard to put together. The mummy and the organs were neat but all of jars fell apart so the projet bombed.
3,lift the Lid on mummies,"The body arrived broken at the leg, but we used it anyhow snce it would be wrapped in guaze. The book had good information and we enjoyed the canopic jars; however the mummification process was too simple. More authentic steps would of served a great purpose here."
5,One of the best kits ever,"I bought this for my 9-year-old nephew. He was having problems in school, and I struggled to find a present that would help him see that learning is fun. I was amazed at the hit this was! He knows now that learning isn't all boring, and all my other neices and nephews were amazed by this kit. Even us adults found ourselves playing with the kids and learning about mummies...the kit even has guts for you to ""maintain""! What a buy!"
4,Some Excellent 'Light Listening',"Maybe it's because of their extreme romanticism, or that they got a lot of play in the mid 20th century, but Enescu's Romanian Rhapsodies seem to be out of fashion today. It's hard to find them both on a single cd.Kenneth Jean and the Slovak Philharmonic offer a performance that is sparkling and zesty. The music is as enjoyable as any of those in the two-cd sets, and you don't have to buy a lot of other baggage in the deal. The sound quality is very good, as well.The Matyas Antal/Hungarian State Orchestra rendering of another warhorse, the Liszt Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2, is also fun."
4,It kept my attention. It had cool stuff like a talking bird.,"It kept my attention. The Boxcar Children are on an island they think they are alone. But they aren't, soon they find a boy, named Peter, who was skip-wrecked. There are a lot of exciting parts, such as when they find a giant turtle shell and when they hear about Peter's friend who went swimming in water where sharks were spotted. He never returned. The ending is good too because they find the lost boy's mother and father. Review by M. D'Adamio"
3,A pretty good book,"This book was a longer boxcar, and fun to read. But it got kind of boring after a while, and one day I just read two pages of it because I just thought it was so borring. But then it got good, and I finished it. At first you might think about just not reading it beacuse it's kind of boring in the first part, but after a little more reading it gets really good."
2,Weak,"This album fits comfortably into Santana's steady deterioration during the second half of the 1970s. Not everything here sucks, but most of it is fairly bland late 70s rock and R&B.; The best stuff on here is probably the two Steve Winwood-related covers -- ""The Dealer"" and ""Well All Right"". (Vocalist Greg Walker sounds quite a bit like Winwood on much of the album.) These aren't great, but they aren't bad.The only tune that deserves special comment is ""Open Invitation"": this song is hilariously awful, the kind of radio-friendly pop-metal that people routinely laugh at. I think it's worth hearing Inner Secrets just for this track.Unless you're a Santana completist or a fan of mediocre late 70s music, I wouldn't bother with this one. The best thing that can be said about it is that some of the later Santana albums would be even worse.[Note: I am basing this review on the 1990 edition, which has an identical tracklist and presumably similar sound quality.]"
1,Yuck!!,"This is Santana at his/its most disappointing. If you love Santana 1, Abraxas, Santana 3, Caravanseri, Lotus, Moonflower (live tracks especially) and Supernatural, you will hate this!Apart from the rare flash of guitar mastery and the occasional latin rhythm (both of which appear by mistake, judging by how quickly they are snufffed out) this could be any second or third rate 70s/80s funky jazzy band. Avoid unless you're just trying to complete your Santana collection, and spend your money on any of the above records instead.Just goes to show how completely Santana afficionadoes can disagree!"
3,"...and a nice album cover, too.""","this lp has all the trimmings of what a santana album contained in the late 70s period of his long journey. however, the song that sticks out in my mind is his cover of the late 60's classic, ""stormy"". this version starts off with some deep fender rhodes playing, and then carlos comes in with his trademark licks. the arrangements have all the 70s vibe that you could ask for and plenty more, so check this one out, if you can."

1,wrong gasket,"this was ordered as replacement gasket for sears weedwacker. use exact part number from sears man., what I got was not right fit."
4,Nice Crate,"This is a very nice crate. It looks great in with your furniture. I did not order it from this web site, but it took two tries to get one that wasn't damaged. The first one arrived in a box that looked like it went through the war in Iraq! It took over a month to get a replacement. The bottom pan was broken in the second one, so I swapped it with the one from the first crate. Between the two packages, I got an entire crate that looks good! I only hope that the rattan doesn't unravel. The first crate was delivered with a lot of it unraveled. My dog, a Golden Retriever mix, absolutely loves it! She is so happy to go in it and she isn't as eager to be to be let out of it in the morning, like she was when she slept in a regular crate. It is very airy and lets in a lot of light. It doesn't make your dog feel so couped up! I put a Midwest Quiet Time fleece pad in it and my dog feels so comfy cozy! She actually smiled the first night that she got to walk into it to go to bed for the night!"
4,Rattan began to unravel,Serves its purpose but was difficult to put together and the rattan unraveled in some places. I am not so sure that the one sent to me wasn't a returned item as well. I was hoping it would look slightly more classy.
3,working but,"It did its job of the cleaning part. But my concern is it does make the leather tougher than before. I applied it on my leather boot and leather bag, after using that, the leather is not as soft as before. the good part, it does remove the stain on the leather."
4,Really convenient,"I love how easy it is to just pull out a wipe and start cleaning my leather shoes. One sheet can be used for up to three of my shoes. Seems to work well, but I don't have experience with regular spray-bottle type cleaners, so I can't make an accurate comparison there."
4,"Powerful features, compact but watch for blurring","I bought this based in prior experience with Sony's easy to use yet effective cameras. So far I am not dissapointed. The unit is pocket sized, if not smaller, packs a ton of features into a tight footprint yet is easy to use. My only beef so far is it seems to easily blur pictures indoors. I have taken many pictures with my old 1.2 MP camera and noticed the ""hand"" indicating low light/possible blurring but was always able to be stable enough to get away without flash. On ths unit you MUST use flash or a tripod or else those family trips will be memories......ONLY. Also, I get a wierd clicking when playing back video shot in quiet conditions. I would have also preferred to zoom in on video, though the hi res video spec (only when used with PRO Memory stick) is sweet."
5,Best Bet,"I bought this camera from Amazon with some Christmas money I recieved. It came shortly after ordering, and when I opened it, I was delighted! There isn't much bad to say about this camera, but since I belive in being positive, I'll list the pro's first.PROS:- Small, lightwieght. Easy to carry in a pocket.- Powers on and off in less than a second- Movie quality is excellent, though not quite a replacement for a JVC- Easy to use- More features than expected- Good Waranty (Year long, any repairs or replacements free)-Arrray of picture quality is avalible based on your memory capacity-Sleek StyleCONS:-Battery life limited, though the problem in eaily solved by buying NiMH rechargeable batteries which last about 2.5ish hours.-Only comes with a 16 megabyte memory card, though a digital camera owner should expect to buy more memory.Overall this camera is excellent. You should not hesitate when buying this camera, it's something you won't regret!"
4,amazing product !!,"This is an amazing price for a Sony 4-Megapixel Digital Camera. I think the reason it's cheaper than most is because it doesn't have an optical zoom. That doesn't bother me; the 3x digital zoom is just fine.Unlike most, this really is a point-and-shoot camera. It is MUCH faster than my old DSC-P50. It powers on in about 2 seconds and processes an image in less than a second. My DSC-P50 takes about 5 seconds to power on and 10 seconds to process an image."
4,Great camera!,"I just bought this camera at Wal-Mart for $187. I love it! I use it to take pictures of my kids' sporting events and assorted other goings-on. It has great picture quality and I like the fact that the camera is small.I haven't tried filming any video with it...we have a Sony Digital Camcorder (which uses the same memory stick).The *only* complaint I have is the very small memory stick. Other than that, it's great!"
4,Awesome camera for the price!,"My husband just bought this for me and I'm very, very pleased! The only thing I would have liked is optical zoom, but this camera is still worth it as I don't plan on obsessively using the zoom. It powers on and off very fast (~1 second?). There isn't a very noticeable delay when you take a picture. The delay is more obvious when you use the flash. Downloading on to your PC should be a breeze. The USB is very fast, even on my ol' Windows 98. The instruction booklet is pretty straight forward.There are two negatives but don't let these dissuade you from buying the camera, especially for under $200!1. You MUST buy a decent sized memomy stick (pro) if you want to take continuous high resolution pics. 128MB and higher. The supplied 16MB just won't cut it if you are a high resolution junkie.2. I highly recommend buying NiMH rechargeable batteries. The batteries that are supplied (regular double A's) lasted a couple of hours."
2,Battery cover won't work,"I received this camera as a gift in December 2004. At the time I knew very little about digital cameras so I was disappointed to be able to take only five photos at a time because the memory stick is so small. I actually used the camera only one time in the last year. However, I recently bought a 512mb memory stick and was looking forward to using the camera. The old alkaline batteries needed to be replaced, so I bought the other kind--I forget what they're called--and put them into the camera. Unfortunately, I had a really hard time holding down the batteries and closing the cover, and the cover quickly jammed, and it is now half-open. I cannot open it, and other people I've asked cannot open it without completely breaking off the cover. Sony told me they'd fix it for $171, which is completely ridiculous, so now I'm stuck with a broken camera that I've used only once."
1,broke after two months,"This camera was great until it just quit working two months and two days after we bought it. Unfortunately we lost our receipt. I was told by Sony that it would have to be fixed at a flat rate of $171. The camera was $178 when I bought it. If you buy this camera be warned SAVE YOUR RECIEPT and register your product. It may also be worthwhile to buy the replacement warranty. The camera was not abused. I took a picture, turned it off like normal, and when I went to take another the lens would not open and the screen read ""turn power off and on again"". That happened on day 2 of vacation. So much for vacation memories!!"
4,"Looks like a good camera, but....",This camera looks great and I have been looking all around for a camera too!! I love Sony they always have great products and I have always had good luck with them in the past. 4 megapixels is pretty good for the price here on Amazon. The only problem it looks like with this camera is that the lens do not seem very protected.
5,Batteries,"I don't own this but was thinking about it... it says ""The camera is powered by two AA batteries (alkalines included, NiMH rechargeables recommended). It measures 4 x 2.13 x 1.38 inches (W x H x D) and weighs 5.5 ounces without Memory Stick or batteries. ""Realize the word recomended after rechargeables... it says alkline included... so that would be your problem"
1,Not a good camera for long term,"I had this camera for 1.5 years. It worked fine all this while but now when i switch on its malfunctions with a message ""Turn the power on & off again"".. peice of junk now....so if u want a camera which would work 4 to 5years don't buy this..RegardsAd"
5,Excellent Value,The prints from this camera are as sharp as my Canon 35MM and I can carry it in my pocket. Excellent Value!
5,super deep house,i totally love this cd. my favorite song is A Stronger Man with the master ben watt and sananda maitreya. AKA TTD has a wonderful and rich voice.build a a deep house disco and they will come. tracy thorn we wait for your and ben's next project with our breath held but accept this offereing of Buzzin' Fly Volume One with open arms and feet dancing well into the morning hours.
2,ZZZZZzzzzz......,"ZZZZZzzzz...uh, oh, hello! Sorry, I must have been sleeping. I was listening to this new CD I bought, Buzzin' Fly Volume One, and I fell asleep, it was so boring. While asleep I dreamt I heard Terence Trent D'Arby, and he was still singing off key! Didn't he change his name to protect the innocent or something? Anyway, this is no Lazy Dog (even my lazy dog Barney thinks so), and no Everything But the Girl. Sorry. Next!"
2,"Informational, but fails to motivate the reader to read it","A very dry book that is written in an easy to read style. That's great, but it is so relaxing that it can put you to sleep within a few pages. Granted, he had a tough topic to create excitement out of, but this reads like one of those textbooks that you dreaded receiving the first day of classes.He talks about the motivation of European imperialism. He should have remembered to motivate the reader to care."
1,I have a lot of Naxos recordings. This is the worst!!!,"I've had this recording for a few years now and tonight listened to it for only about the third time. It is awful!!! The music is incoherent and wanders around seemingly pointlessly. Even the Academic Festival Overture (which was one of my childhood favorites about 60 years ago) is so out of focus and the interpretation so ridiculous it was hard to listen through it. The first two times I listened to it I didn't like it, but thought it might be me. This time convinced me. Virtually all of the Naxos recordings I have are good to great, what happened here?"
3,Too dark for me,"Too dark for meThis review requires that I write ten more words. Word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word, word."
1,The Killing Kind,"As a lover of mysteries I was horrified and disgusted to the extent that, after the first 50 pages I put this book down for good. For the first time in my life I considered offering my copy for destruction - I have never read copy that was so gruesome and found absolutely no saving factor therein. I will definitely remember this supposed writer's name and will avoid anything else he has written or will write in future. This book was not written to either inform or entertain - it was written to nauseate.P.Sandler"
5,Keeps Getting Better,This is the third installment for John Connolly's haunted PI character Charlie Parker and he just keeps getting better. The plot this time revolves around a secrative cult in northern Maine. Parker is hired by wealthy local Magnate Jack Mercier to investigate the supposed suicide of Grace Peltier a woman he once dated as a teen. This investigation leads him deep into the clandestine and violent activities of the Fellowship.
4,the killing kind,"I like John Connolly's novels, Dark Hallow is my favorite. The Killing Kind was good of course, but unlike this author's other books that I read, this one scared the 'heck' out me for some reason."
4,"Good, but not great.","I very much enjoyed this book just as I have enjoyed all of the Charlie Parker stories thus far. However, I felt that the story dragged on a bit in places. Also, SPOILER ALERT.... I think that the end was very much out-of-character for Parker. Parker is, much to my delight, a vigilante who routinely doles out much-deserved reckoning to the unredeemably evil. The idea that he would spare a baddie and turn that person over to the Criminal Justice System for a proper come-uppance was a bit of a downer. True, it did serve as the foundation for a future book, but still left me a bit deflated."
3,Where are the O BOYZ songs??,"If they were on here, this would be a 5-star disc; since they're not, it's only a 3."
1,My Daddy is a Bad Man,"I told my daddy that i wanted the new CD with CCR on it, and he got me credense cleerwater revival."
4,good g-rated pop music fun,"I was kinda doubtful about buying this for my girls, but I gave in, and after listening a few times I have to give it a decent rating. I'm not familiar with the artists featured, but there's nothing objectional on the CD, and the music is fun and danceable."
4,Should be Christie's Cd.....,"The cd is good, all the songs are, I'm not saying it's bad. I love all of them, especially Call Me, Beep Me. But I really think Christie Carlson Romano should have a CD of her own: she has that awesome singing voice."
3,good gun but there is a reason its $75,"delivery was on time, and at first no problems, i thought i had an under-priced gun but after two weeks and three airsoft games, problems began to surface1) not a very long range2)i am missing parts no. 28 and no.9 according to the manual3)trigger is a little faulty (i have only had 1 instance where it would not work)4)it seems to be using a lot of gas inefficiently5) although it is all metal(with the exception of the abs plastic grip) i feel as if i am going to break itover all these problems aren't that bad, and the gun still functions well, i don't know how long it will stay that way, if you can afford it i recommend a better gun."

1,Avoid this piece of junk - buy a Canon or Nikon,"The flash on this camera broke after < 2 months. Sent back to Konica-Minolta for warranty service was told that repair takes 2 months. 3 1/2 mos go by and no word from manufacturer. I called, found out they are awaiting parts from Japan and would take another month. I called again after 6 weeks and was told that the parts are no longer being made as camera is discontinued. They will send me a ""REFURBED"" replacement as my only recourse. Since I had no choice, I took that. The refurb broke after 2 months as well - autofocus no longer focuses, and the metal ring around the tip of the lens fell off. No wonder Konica-Minolta is now out of the digital camera business. Buy a Canon or Nikon instead."
1,Lousy Camera,"I have had this camera about 6 months and have had to return it twice so far for the same repair, without any explanation or recourse of requesting a replacement. I use the camera for my work so two to three weeks per repair is pretty disruptive to my schedule. Quick shots are out of the question since the camera is ultra sensitive to any tremor, and I must always use a tripod."
5,Worth listening to.,"A fine piece of listening music. Nothing complicated or heavily produced; just John's soulful voice and acoustic guitar with an occasional acoustic base and harmonica (and a guest appearance from Karen Ramos on ""Gettin' Time to Go.""All the songs are original, written and performed by John himself. They are, in truth, the blues; peppered with sweet bitterness and a life well lived. Mellow and introspective, this is music that deserves to be listened to."
3,This is why I walk and talk this Way!,"The z-trip remix is good, the six day remix sucks(b-52s sample!), the gdmfsob remix is sketchy, the radio version of walkie talkie is actually better than the lp version(how come every single from the private press uses this beat one way or another?-treach battle beat, six days remix w/mos def, this mix) and mashin on the motorway still sucks(should've been an instrumental). The videos are pretty cool though(dvd! hooray!)so buy this only for a)right thing remix or b)you are a dj shadow completist."
2,The new M isn't as good...,"Since M has changed their look (the m is more cursive) their magazine hasn't been as good. There are a lot of stupid posters like one of Green Day having a foodfight. Also, some of the JoJo and Chad Michael Muarry posters look fake. The articles are so short and this magazine is really tacky."
3,Uh- It's O.K,"I am a huge fan of teen magazines, but I wasn't very impressed with M. I found it to be written as if they are trying to make it as easy to understand as possible.It's kind of lame and the articles are so short! It's mainly only celeb oriented and it took me like hardly any time to read it. Definetly not one of my top picks for mags."
2,Late,"It's almost as if this magazine writes it's stories 2 mounths in advance onces you get the ""latest"" copy it's news that has been repeated 7961,583 times . It does however have decent posters (that's why it got a 2 and not just 1) but thats about the only thing that this magazine has to offer."
2,Way too kiddy,"I don`t like this magazine. It is so boring. The gossip is lame and dry, and it`s basically a mag for tweens to say OMG, ANOTHER HD poster for my room!! There`s hardly any real pages, just regular old posters. Teens, beware- you will be disappointed and totally bored. This is a magazine for girls aged 9-12. Strictly for tweens."
3,ok...,"when i first stqarted reading ""real"" magazines, this was my absolote fave. if you are 9-13 yrs. old you will like this magazine. I recommend mags like YM, teen people and Teen (my fave!) for anyone 11-17, though, rather than mags like M or bop."
5,Mag Madness,"Okaye it's a chick flick mag, but it's the best one ever! I love M!!! I subscribed and I have every issue. They have Fun Pages, M-libs, humiliating and gross stories, address's of stars, contests, M-comics, mini locker posters, 4 huge posters in every issue, best and worst dressed, and the juiciest gossip! If you really like M, try Bop and TigerBeat."
3,its pretty good,i think that this magazine is good once in while but not as a subscription. the magazine doesnt vary enough for a subscription. i get this magazine maybe once every 4 months and it doesnt get boring. plus i like the posters.
5,All about your fav celebs!,"If you want to know about EVERYTHING going on in hollywood with celebs this is the magazine for you! It has everything from movies coming out, to new cds, and great rumors which are fact or fiction which really helps me! If you want to know everything about your fav celebs from their shoe size to what nail polish they use this is the magazine for you!"
1,NOT FOR TEENS UNLESS U DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR CHILD,"My daughter is 11 and brought this magazine home. I opened it and it say ""See Zacs hot Bod"" and ""Inside Zanessas private getaway with her boyfriend"" ! Im Sorry, if you are a parent, DO NOT LET YOUR CHILD GET THIS MAGAZINE. Its full of shirtless guys and it talks abour RELATIONSHIPS and dating!! NO NO NO NO. This is why the kids of Hollyweird are so screwed because the parents put them into this trash and dont know what their children are reading! A girl 16 talks about being unlucky in love!! What the hell!! and in an AD for Punkrose shows a WOMAN with her breast out of her shirt!! BE A PARENT, SAY NO."
1,Takes about 3 months to receive!,"I purchased this subscription on Nov. 7th. I figured that it would get here around Christmas. It gave a 6-8 week delivery time. Even a week after Christmas would have been okay, because it would have been anticipated soon after. After I purchased it, it said it was coming at the end of January! Are you kidding me? That's almost 3 months! I had to run down to the local drug store and purchase a single copy for Christmas. They better not send me a BACK copy! I don't want any duplicates! Whatever it tells you for delivery time, add on another month!"
5,appropriate,I had a very difficult time finding a periodical that was appropriate for a 13 year old. The others are so smutey. This one filled the bill and the parents agreed.
1,ONLY GET HALF THE ISSUES,"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift and we have only received 3 issues. Customer Service says they'll extend the subscription...but what good is that if you don't get them?I've written to them numerous times and they always come back saying ""it was sent on xxx"". But one time, I actually talked to someone and they came up with a different mailing date so I am inclined to believe they just make them up. I've never had any problem receiving any of my mail and don't believe that my mailman is swiping this mag.It sounds like they just don't ship them."
1,WHERE IS IT?,I ordered this magazine on 10/7/06 (over three months ago) and haven;t received a single copy yet!!! STINKY SERVICE!!!
4,Hot Mag,"I think this magazine is totally hot, I luv the postas 2! It has cool articles and GR8 emberrasing moments, but a little 2 much mean gossip about celebs and it could be a little longer."
3,Not the best at all...,"I have read this mag, and it's just sloppy;it has poor formatting,and it tries, I think, to much to be like J-14. It's like DiscoveryGirls trying to be like American Girl. Pathetic attempt. But I do like the Nick&Jessica; comic in the end. Thats cute"
4,I LOVE M MAGAZINE!!!!,"This is a great magazine for girls!! Has awesome make-up tips,beauty,fashion, gossip, quizzes embarassing momments. PLUS!! its has awesome posters too! mega big ones, i think 8 counting front and back in each magazine! so chek them out! their great!"
2,"Great ideas, but paint smears","I was very excited to see a face painting product that my children could use to paint on each other without water. Unfortunately, the crayons never dry out once applied to the body. The paint remains smeary even hours later and the black and red paints stain furniture and clothing. Ultimately, a good idea, poorly executed."
4,Works Great,"I needed to custom fabricate a mounting rig for my Asus AM2 motherboard combination.Otherwise, I am extremely satisfied."
3,Pepper Plant Chipotle as a BBQ,"I am a long time fan of the the Original Pepper Plant Sauce, it's the best hot sauce out there in my book.As for the Chipotle sauce, it's got a good smokey flavor, but it's more of a BBQ sauce replacement than a hot sauce for eggs or dishes. I use it for my BBQ or grilled chicken and pork, it's a good sauce for that, but not much more. Lastly, it's not that ""hot"" of a sauce, just a nice chipotle/ smoke flavor"
4,Best Chipotle Ever,"I'm not a big fan of Chipotle, because it's usually associated with too sweet or too smoky of a flavor, but this is neither. It is really an authentic Chipotle flavor and isn't overpowering in any way. The Pepper Plant rocks."
3,Dead Souls by Ian Rankin,It is very Scottish and the pacing is a little slow and understated. Some of the terms are foreign and have to be understood by their context.
4,Dead Souls: An Inspector Rebus Novel,"As usual Rankin does a terrific writing job and keeps you in suspense, butnot as good as some of his others. Throughly enjoyed"
4,Another good English mystery/thriller writer,"I usually read Ruth Rendell, PD James, Walter Minnette. I found this book just as exciting. It's rather thick, but its easy read. John Rebus is a man with conscience and determination. Although sometimes he goes too far as in the case of Darren Rough, but he was doing his duty and things got out of hand."
3,Moderate,"The formula of mixing several ongoing cases with the personal lives of those who detect them removes detective fiction from the starchy abstractions of a Christie or Hammett, but often leaves the reader thrashing through mountains of detail in order to get to the final approach for landing in which the vital clues all come out of the closet in order. It is the pursuit of renewal of the motivation to be police officers and to do what is just in a usually unjust world that drives this book, and as such character drama, it is massively effective. While the mystery hobbles itself by introducing madmen and conspiratorial indolent rich in the last quarter of the book, and while it is somewhat easy to spot the intended progress of the novel, it makes for a good read for those who like ""comfy"" personality-based mystery writing."
3,"A stolid, earthy, pictish performance","Reading ""Dead Souls"" was reminiscent of eating a haggis supper through a copy of the ""Sunday Post"". Somewhat gritty, but worth it!"
4,very pleased,"I didnt know what to exspect from the sale priced speakers. For my application they are perfect. They are large for surround speakers. For the price, #49.9, I don't think they can be beat."
3,it was not as good as others,"I am a true fan of b. small's work. Lately, I have been looking for more of her older work. I hope she can go back to that. This book was ok."
3,Like I mentioned in my previous rating before I have read better books,"I have read books my this author that were better and held my attention to it. It was okay for the time that was allotted for reading the book.The title was Love, Remember Me by Bertrice Small"
3,Love Remember Me,"Love, Remember MeI usually like Small's stories and I do skip most of the sex scenes, but this one went way overboard. I did not finish the book."
3,Not really the best,"This is the first book that I have read from Small. It was a little hard to get into in the beginning, and I thought that she used way too many characters with the same names, So that made it a little difficult to follow.I didnt care for the ending."
3,"it was good, but.......................",The romance between Nyssa and Varian is wonderful-there is just not enough of it. The story revolves too much around Henry VIII and Catherine Howard. Nyssa and Varian seem like secondary characters.
4,"One or two flaws, otherwise a great read!","I love English history, and have always been fascinated by Tudor England. This book is a sequel to Ms. Small's ""Blaze Wyndham"", and stars her daughter, Nyssa. Nyssa is a lady in waiting to Henry's soon-to-be-discarded queen Anne of Cleves.While the characters were great, Varian (the hero) was hot and the sex steamy, and the history MOSTLY painstakingly researched, there is one flaw - Ms. Small consistently depicts characters as having first and middle names. No one during this time period in England had middle names. Only in Southern Europe did people have more than one ""Christian"" name, until about 1750 or so. I know this is a tiny detail, but it really, really bothered me! Painstaking research is so important in historicals, and I know there is endless dispute about details, but this is a major slipup.Aside from this quibble - enjoy, it's a great read!"
5,prarie memories,Ever since I was in grammar school I could not wait to get home and see the Little House Tv series. Now 30 years later I relive these wonderful memories with my daughter. She really enjoys the same things that I did I watching this time in history. A wonderful book.
4,Very Nicely Done,this is a very nicely put together book. My daughter read all of the Little House books. When I saw this book I got it for her. It was nice and informative.
3,Disappointing...,"There were a few photos here that I hadn't seen elsewhere, but there wasn't really any new information for me, so I was somewhat disappointed. It also seemed to be written for juvenile fans of the Little House books, but I wish someone would remember that Ms. Wilder has ADULT fans, too, and write something for us."
3,Laura's Album: A Remembrance Scrapbook of Laura Ingalls Wilder,"I thought this scrapbook would be like the ""Egyptology"", ""Wizardology"" etc. books; with the removable pieces inside the book."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this book but I was disappointed, although some of the contents were interesting. There were many reproductions of letters and articles, but many of them were too small to read, incomplete or partly covered up by something else. It was interesting to see the letters or articles, but I would have liked to read the whole thing, rather than being able to see only some of it. For the parts that aren't covered up, you may need a magnifying glass! The photos were also interesting, but many of them were small, dark and in need of restoration. I would have liked to give a better review because I'm a fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder."
1,NOT RECEIVED YET WHY?,"IM STILL WAITING ON THIS SLOW SNAIL MAIL, HOPEFULLY IT WILL COME TODAY I HAVE TRIED TRACKING THIS DOWN WITH NO LUCK AND ITS FOR CHRISTMAS IT SAYS IT WAS DELIEVERED BUT NOT HERE?"
3,an OK book,"I used this book for review before taking the test. I got a 4. However, I advise you balk at this book until a new edition comes out mainly because this book is not up to date w/ the test format. However, the sections were quite helpful. Although a little bit lengthy, starting around January or February using this book will help by the time u take the test in May. If you need review for the concepts and vocab just be advised you should ignore the paragraph correction part because that is no longer in the newer version of the AP test. He never tells you how to score the tests in the book so you're also unsure about what you'll really get. But still a good spanish review."
3,Nice piece of history of the idea.,"If you want to see a pretty straight-forward history of the quest to create a water-powered engine, this assemblage of essays and historical information is a nice work.However, this is not a how-to manual. It's a how-it's-been-tried manual."
1,A history book,If you expect help in building your own hydrogen generating equipment get a different book.This is a collection of old articles and old patents.A museum book.
2,RX-7 Aftermarket Manual,"For the real mechanics:This book will leave you asking many questions as most of the electrical information is just absent. The diagrams are substandard, the instructions and diagnostic strategies are brief when present. I have two of these, and I shelled out the $100+ for the dealer manuals so I would know what the hell I was doing.For the weekend warrior:Want to find your oil drain plug? Need to change your thermostat? These books are great for basic service and maintenance and nothing else."
5,"Recently diagnosed hemachromatotic (""tottie"")","Every family and every doctor should know about this book. So much suffering could be avoided. I look back at members of my family, and can now identify the ""totties"". Some had heart problems, some diabetes, some gout/arthritis, some altzheimer-like symptoms, some liver cancer, some bronze skin. I was lucky. This book was instrumental in my insisting on being genetically checked when early symptoms appeared, and before (hopefully) too much damage was done. Robin Camp, Calgary"
5,A quick recovery will soon follow-,"I personally think that anyone who reads this book with realize that filing bankruptcy can be a good thing. Stephen and his wife are doing something extra ordinarily special, going out of their way to help people like myself. It's an easy read and I can truly say that it is a step by step plan to lasting recovery. If you follow the steps- a quick recovery will soon follow!!"
2,Bankruptcy,"There is a moderate amount of useful information about life after bankruptcy. Probably half of the information can be found on the internet. However, the author should not have used the bankruptcy information as a cover for preaching his religious beliefs. I felt mislead."
1,CRASH COURSE IN RELIGION?,"I should have read the reviews a bit better BEFORE ordering this book! Not only is there NO ""step-by-step"" guide to repairing your credit, but this man is just plain offensive! He makes sexist pig comments such as how he is the ""leader"" of his house, but he takes his wife's opinion into consideration....well how nice of him!I hope no Ford Motor Company employees purchase this book, he also comments on how when he found out a Ford was about the only vehicle he could purchase after bankruptcy they were ""scared it would fall apart"" being a measly American made vehicle and all. How embarrassing to have to call this man a fellow American!If you want to read about how jesus saves, women are morons, and american made items are junk, buy this book. Otherwise, start saving your money now and and dont waste your time! I'm selling mine right now (I just got it today) and I feel like i'm ripping someone off by even re-selling this crap!"
5,"""Credit After Bankruptcy"" by Steven Snyder","We never thought that we would ever face bankruptcy but, being entrepreneurs, we were always at risk and finally had to ""go under"". After the horrid shock, we were lucky enough to attend Steven's seminar and found out that all was not lost.After reading his book, we followed his precepts and now, two years later, we are back on the credit track. We WILL pay back all our old creditors one day - it's the right thing to do!"
5,on the road to recovery,"I read the review by Daph. Obviously she didn't truly read this wonderful book. Mr. Snyder does not talk down to women. Instead, he encourages husbands to listen to their wives and their ""sixth sense."" Each chapter is a step to be learned in the recovery process, so no - there is not a graph showing the steps to take. There's way too much information to consider to print it in such a way. There's many ways to establish credit. This book is for people who want to learn the RIGHT way to do it. Mr. Snyder's examples of his previous thinking (that Ford sucks) is written in a humerous way that tells us all to ""build a bridge and get over it"" if we want to do this the RIGHT way. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to reestablish their credit, whether bankrupt or not."
5,Bankruptcy,This is a good book for someone who filed bankruptcy this book has given me a lot of insight on thing
1,Waste of time and money,"I've never written a review here although I purchase often. But Credit after Bankruptcy was such an incredible waste of time and money that felt the need to let others know. This book has no real substance, superficial advice that can be found in any number of online articles on bankruptcy. Poorly written; often repeating stories from chapter to chapter, a very dry and non-engaging format. Save your money!"
5,Inspiring,This book has inspired me and encourages me that there is hope for a brighter financial future after declaring bankruptcy.
5,Credit after Bankruptcy,"I purchashed and read this book, followed the instructions and even with a chapter 13 bankruptcy on my credit report, I received a Sears card, 3 unsecured credit cards and a personal loan of [$$$] from my credit union. I am also receiving offers for new credit cards which I am turning down! I never thought that any of this could happen, but with the information in this book I found it to be very easy.Thanks Stephen"
5,excellent,"This book is not only for those who need to get on with life after bankruptcy, but a step by step way to do it. Loved this book"
5,A realistic approach to recovering from bankruptcy,"This is an excellent book on recovering from a bankruptcy. It presents a realistic plan for obtaining credit after bankruptcy and offers a strategy for building a strong credit rating. It also gives do's and don'ts to keep creditors from taking advantage of you. Even if you've never filed for bankruptcy, this book offers a wealth of information about the inside world of credit and finance."
5,"If you are considering Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, you MUST read .",This book was extremely helpful in assisting me in recovering from bankruptcy.
2,Not Very Useful,"First: Read other reviews carefully. Some are from people associated with the author -- one from the author himself! That 4-star rating may be skewed ...Second: If you are not Christian, you'll find this book preachy. If you are Christian, you may still find this book preachy.Third: The book lacks practicality. It is hard to figure out the author's directions for getting back on track. I bought this and two other books to help recover from Chapter 7. This was the worst of the three."
2,Grrrr.....,"If you're a woman who likes to think on your own, then Snyder's gonna insult you. He makes a big show of being the head of the family and how his wife has to go along with it. Plus, add in the Born-again factor, and I'm out. Good thing you can resell these online."
2,Mostly Common Sense,"I found this book of very little value. I do not share the author's guidelines that to succesfully rebuild your credit after bankruptcy that you have to give away your pets and find religion. Most of the content is mere common sense and gets very repititive. The author is obviously basking in the good life after his bankruptcy by selling overpriced advice, all of which could be summed up in 10-15 pages."
5,excellent,"This book is easy to understand, and is very informative as well. It tells you step by step,how and what you should do. It also explains why you should do it a certain way. I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it to anyone who has filed bankruptcy or anyone who is thinking about filing."
4,Good sound advice,"I read the book and my wife and I attended the seminar here in St. Louis. Stephen gives good advice and a wonderful presentation with it. If you can't attend the seminar, read the book. It's helped us already. He's been through it himself! He will also answer your questions by e-mail if they aren't too technical. I'm following his advice and looking forward to good results."
3,Ok I guess,"I skimmed thru the book pretty quickly. I got some great tips out of it and havent opened the book again. The most important thing was to establish credit quickly. The thing about this book is that you will not be able to find the book at the public library. So, if you need some ideas purchase the book."
1,"Sexist, out of touch and downright weird","This is one of the most strange books I have read. The author is sexist and out of touch with modern society. He differentiates betweeen ""men's work"" and ""women's work"", pushes religion, and among his 32 ways to cut living expenses he recommends finding new homes for your pets and other strange suggestions (like not sending Christmas cards but writing more letters throughout the year). I also find it alarming how he touts leasing cars, and he apparently does it quite often as he speaks of his third car, his wife's fourth car, etc. Why not just buy a decent used car and pay for the upkeep? Really bizarre and a complete waste of time. Like another reviewer mentioned, there is much more complete and up to date information available all over the web. Also, try your local non-profit credit counseling office, they generally offer free classes and educational material."
2,Not very good advice,"If you're a reasonably intelligent person who has filled for bankruptcy, and have spent any amount of time studying it's effects on credit, you're probably not going to learn anything new from this book.In fact, I think the author is way off the mark in many areas. Some of his suggestions are downright ridiculous and unnecessary. For example, he suggests that the only car you might be able to lease shortly after your bankruptcy is discharged is a Ford Escort. HELLO. Is he really serious? I know from personal experience, that this is far from the truth.I also have to laugh at his list of suggestions for cutting expenses. Most of them we've heard a thousand times before and are only practical for people who live in caves totally removed from society.How about some practical advice for real people who live in the real world.This is the first book I have ever returned for credit."
4,Life After Bankruptcy,"As a consumer bankruptcy attorney I was concerned about how my clients fared post bankruptcy once their case was closed. I found this book and I recommend it and routinely lend it out to my clients post filing.The book is an easy read and explains what the creditors look for in determining an individual's creditworthiness. Yes, having a bankruptcy on your credit report has a negative impact though sometimes not as much as the excessive debt. This books provides information about the steps one could take to greatly minimize the bankruptcy effect. It also helps individuals also avoid common mistakes such as being taken advantage of by subprime creditors who offer outrageously expensive credit.I can barely keep this book in my office.Kathryn U. TokarskaAttorney at Law[...]"
4,Great Book - One to keep for months to come,"I read Stephen's book in two days. It was so easy to read and the information in the book was so very helpful. I thought I was doing everything the right way, however, Stephen's book told me that I was doing everything wrong!This is a must have for anyone who is recovering after a bankruptcy."
5,Fantastic and Motivational,Credit After Bankruptcy: I strongly feel has given me a new start in life.
5,Wonderful Book,I found this book very helpful in recovering from my Bankruptcy. I would highly recomend it to anyone.
5,Book changed my life,This book changed my life. It is very well-written and easy to read. It offers practical advice that everyday consumers can understand and put to use. I learned more about credit and bankruptcy from reading this book than I have from every other source my entire life. I hope he comes out with some more books because I'd sure buy them. Stephen Snyder is the man with a plan.
1,Ordered Book and Denied Secured Credit Card,"I ordered the book, followed the directions, mailed $200 to a secured credit card company, and received a letter stating my secured credit card was denied because I had poor credit. I returned the book for a refund."
4,Pleasant performance of Gershwin classics,"This is a very pleasing recording, with fine performances. It may not be the best ever recording of these Gershwin pieces, but it is a very good budget-priced set, with helpful, interesting liner notes.I knocked off a star, because the clarinet glissando is definitely not the most exciting rendition of that important opening to Rhapsody in Blue.Kathryn Selby shows an affinity for this genre, but is also comfortable with traditional classical concertos, and chamber music."
2,Not worth it,"If you are serious about designing your own home, do yourself a favor and invest in a better package than this one.The feature that drew my attention to this title was the plan tracer. You can load a plan graphic and draw walls over it - but the program isn't smart enough to recognize closed four-sided boxes as rooms. Additionally, the grid-snapping is arbitrary - sometimes you can move a wall at will, sometimes not. This is true when designing from scratch, too - the system is inflexible and awkward to use. Fortunately the 3D camera is self-intuitive.The other programs included in this package are equally weak. The interior photo designer is clever but unrealistic, and so on.A word of caution: if you're used to house-building in the Sims, you will definitely find this lacking. And if the construction engine in a computer game is better than in something you're supposed to use to design a REAL home, are you sure you want to spend the money on this product?"
3,Better than I expected,"I would say that my main criticism of this film is that the child who played Shirley was too old for the part. The child was very good. She even has a better voice than Shirley has. She faithfully recreated some difficult dance numbers. My favorite being the one from Captain January. It is unfair to expect one child to play another child between the ages of 5 and 12. Also, if you read the book, you will note that things were not always quite so wonderful for young Shirley. The movie came to an abrupt end after only 90 minutes. It never went into the fact that her family mismanaged her money.The child is very talented that played Shirley. It was an overwhleming task to play a living legend."
2,"Good quality, but does not match description","This is an excellent quality DVD, and will be appreciated by all Shirley Temple fans. However, I was disappointed to find that while the online description gives the runtime as the original 95 minutes, the DVD I was sent was the more commonly available 88 minute CUT version."
4,Good (ship lollipop),"Good movie in so-so condition. Honestly the actress they picked was too annoying for words and the disk was scratched the first time I opened it but once cleaned it worked fine: you just have to clean it EVERY time. However, it was only 10 muffins so would I buy it again? Sure I would."
2,OK,"Ashley Rose Orr was nothing like Shirley Temple. Shirley had sparkle and pizazz. Ashley looked like a child trying to pretend to be Shirley. What kept me interested were the dance numbers. There wasn't very much information about her fame and life. All they really covered was how her contract changed from time to time how Fox changed to 20th Century Fox and that she didnt get Dorothy in Wizard of Oz (which im so glad she didnt b/c it would have just been aother Shirley Movie nothing big) otherwise. Ashley acts nothing like shirley would have acted off screne, looks nothing like her, sounds nothing like her, and why is a 10 year old playing a 5 year old?"
1,Save your money,"I have to agree with the other two reviews: this attempt at a movie is horrible! My 2-year-old loves the real cars movie, but he won't watch this for 5 minutes without coming to me to ask for a different one. I bought it because it was only [...] bucks, but that was [...] bucks straight down the drain. Save your money."
1,Give This a Pass,"This is lame. The animation is awful, the voice over weak. Our son had no interest in watching and the movie annoyed us. This one goes in the trash and the other two we bought concurrently went back to Amazon."
1,Waste of time and money,"Save your money. This movie is a cheap attempt to recreate the Disney Pixar Cars story line. The characters are all similar to the Disney Pixar Cars characters but the screen play, the writing and the animation are awful, awful, awful. Even my 5 year old who loves anything with race cars did not like this movie."
1,Horrid,"Worst children's movie that I've had the misfortune of purchasing. Terrible voices, cut-rate animation, inappropriate innuendo. The voices on this film are enough to make even the most steely-jawed parent cringe. It is a disaster, even as far as cartoons are concerned. There seemed to be a lot of attempts at innuendo in here, but not in a clever way to maintain the innocence of the movie but more in a crude way such as ""I'd like a good look at her bumper, oh and her headlights too- hehe"". Save your time, money, and brain cells and skip this movie."
2,This is a MINI ball stomper,"The description says nothing about it but this stomper is a mini and the ball is about half the size of a tennis ball. So it won't hold regular tennis balls, so any replacements have to be bought at a pet store. My dog is too big for the mini balls so it was money wasted. It works ok I guess as far as shooting the ball but she was more interested in the stomper than the ball."
3,Not what I had hoped it would be,"This is definitely not a good product for medium or large dogs. I have a fifty pound mixed breed who loves to play ball. The flinger I use is fine except when I have problems with my back. So I thought this would be a great solution. Not so much. We used it once. Try as I might I could not get the ball much further than a few yards no matter how hard or soft I stomped the Stomp'r. This may work for you if have a small dog and don't need a ball to go very far, but my dog would never get the exercise he needs using this product. And it in no way will it launch a ball as far as the package claims."
3,good video bad copy,We usually get this video from the library and the boys really enjoy it. This copy was not in very good shape and stops when it reaches certain places. Should have purchased new instead of used
3,Angel dress,"Unlike the usual costumes that are made quite skimpy,this dress was quite large for a large and able to accommodate alot more body than was thought. Good to know that the costume has other identities as well. the sleeves were a bit cumbersome, the material not soft and flowing enough so I did some nip and tucks to accommodate them. Best to wear a long slip underneath the dress, which is pretty long. I'm only 5' so I had to take up a few inches in the hem. Costume works very well with wings."
4,Better than WW III South China Sea,"I rather enjoyed this book. The old favorites from the WW III series are back. General Freeman is called upon to lead Federal forces against the militia. The good thing is that he acts like the General Freeman of old and not the ""head in the clouds"" version of the WWIII South China Sea. I think this should be a great series. However, the militia is shown as blood thirsty savages. I disagree with this tact. Overall, it is a decent enough book!"
3,"Well written, but not as exciting as his previous works.","The book showed both sides of the conflict in an equal perspective. However, Ian Slater didn't seem to put the same amount of emotion into this work as he has in his previous works. Even though it was entertaining reading, it seemed a bit on the dry side. The book seemed to drag on in certain spots. As a fan of Mr. Slater, I feel that this book was somewhat lacking the detail of his past works. I didn't seem to get a feel of the characters as I have been able to in his past novels. In his previous books I felt as if I personally knew the characters, I felt their pain and their joy, but not this time, the characters seemed too one sided this time around."
2,"Stick with the WWIII series, it is much better.","This is Slater's worst book ever!!! He portrays the militias as an organized fighting unit that could give the airborne guys an good fight!!! Hah! Slater, obviously do not know anything about the militia movement in America. They could never fight a convential battle with American military units because they would have been smashed. And I knew that he would portray the real Americans as the baby killers and those stupid militia guys as heroes. It seems that Slater's vast military knowledge vanished while writing this book. Stick to the WWIII series if you want to continue writing good books, Mr. Slater."
2,Not as good as anything else... you could do better,"And so could I. This book as most of his others is another long drawn out adventure of some outrageous military tatics. While the threat is real, no real militia is so organized as to join up with all the others to suceed from the Union. And he always seems that every American general is either a suck-up or a flamboyant, egotistical, combination George S. Patton/Douglas MacArthur/Dwight D. Eisenhower/Stormin' Norman. And that only a real general would lead his troops from the front and lead them into the battle itself. If you want to read it, please do so with your brain turned off..."
3,This should be the last of his series...,"Ian Slater has done a great job in producing his WWIII series, however, it is time to quit. The first books in the series are excellent and very hard to put down. The characters demand attention and the action is tight and inticing. Unfortunatly, the characters become far too repetitious and invulnerable as the series goes on. USA Vs. Militia is an interesting romp through a war zone, apparently accurate in location and tecnology, but tries too hard to rerun the same heros and pit brother-on-brother in another civil war"
1,Buy it only if you need tinder for your fireplace,"""Check it out! I can use the cool military acronyms too!""That's what this book screamed at me when I read it. Slater's artistic license should be permanently revoked over this book: the US military is depicted as being so inept and stupid that they'd surrender to your average Pokemon armed with a Taco Bell Chalupa. The cover is misleading; there's no air combat at all. To top it off, the miltia freaks are depicted as more organized than they probably are in real life: gun control is not a big enough issue to foment a rebellion around, and the whole war would probably turn into an American version of the Indian Mutiny of 1857.The only frightening thing about this scenario is that it spawned sequels. Anybody who thinks Slater's better than Tom Clancy should know that Clancy at least researches his material."
1,If I could give it no stars I would,"This book was just bad. It was poorly organized and it was easy to get confused. Mr. Slater tried to have the detail of Clancy and the blood and gore of Bond. He missed on both. Don't bother with this book.This is the first Ian Slater I have read. I was going to pick the WWW III series, but after reading this book, I don't know if I want to take another chance on Ian Slater.To bad, the concept was good, writing was bad."
4,slow start but powerful ending,This book is the first of a set of five and if you don't have it and you have the others this book has some of the details related to the other four books that make it worth reading.matthew James
1,Don't even look at the cover!,"I had heard many good things about Mr. Slater's WWIII series, so naturally I decided to pick up this book; what a let down. I don't know where he gets his information but the parts in the book dealing with special operations and airborne forces are totally absurd. The author sounds like he got his situations out of SOF magazine!I don't think any intelligent reader with any inkling of military ops and procedure will be fooled by this kindergarten attempt at military fiction. Reading this book was a trial. If you want to read really good military adventure, don't even look at the cover, stay with Tom Clancy or Harold Coyle."
3,i don't know if the premise is to realistic but it is int...,this book was interesting but there are several sequals to it and I think if our military can take down the soviet Union we could handle a full scale militia revolt I guess this is a sequal to the WWIII series thats how I read it at least
1,Don't waste your time.,"This book is not well written or researched. The author hasnot researched the militia movement in depth.He makes the miltia members out to be racist, drunken rednecks.And the government as the all powerful protecters of the littleguys."
2,This book is mis-titled.,"This book is probably very useful for some people, but I found it to be mis-titled and not very useful for me. I bought it after the death of my 19-day-old son, thinking it would help comfort me in my grieving. As I read it, I found it to deal more with loss through abortion than any other type of loss. Not being in that situation, I didn't find it helpful. If you had abortion-related questions, though, it would probably be great."
2,NOT for a grieving heart.,"I recieved this book from a friend after losing my daughter to still birth at nearly 7 months. The comparison of my family's loss to a ""flight that departed just a bit early"" enraged me rather than provide any comfort. The very fact that the author could make such a shoddy comparison is a clear indicator that a tragedy of this magnitude has never touched his life.The book continues with what I am sure were meant to be good intentions( which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one) but slowly unravels to a very thinly disguised guilt inducing essay on "" aren't you sorry now you had an abortion"". This book deals very little with the heartbreak of a death of a baby that you had no power to save, it does nothing to assuage the hearts of the parents of miscarriage, stillbirth, or babies lost shortly after birth.I do not reccomend this book if any of those events are what you are going thru now."
1,"Don't read this book, it's unsettling and a soap box.","I began reading this book after the still birth of my son. I needed something comforting, this is not it. It's a ""compasionate"" view from a man who has no understanding of the pain he is dealing with and focuses mearly on his soap box on abortion. A tad condescending, I give him a break because he is a good man and a strong leader. He begins with a scripture out of context then explains it failing to back his explaination up with scripture (the biggest downfall of the book - since that is its main focus) or with reasoning. It really just frustrated me as you might be able to tell, and I wonder if Hayford has truely ever felt the loss of someone so close to him. Read ""As I lay my Isaac Down"" for a truely compassionate and meaty insight filled book on the subject. God bless you if you're searching in this subject, you're not alone."
2,Good book for those who aborted a child but not good for those who experienced stillbirth or miscarriage.,This is an excellent book for those who had control over their baby's life and future. This is not a good book for those who experienced stillbirth or miscarriage as we did not have control over why our babies passed away. I would not recommend this book as most of it focused on forgiveness for those who aborted their child and answers to their questions on whether their baby would know them or forgive them for getting an abortion. I would recommend reading Safe in the Arms of God by John MacArthur instead.
2,Not what I needed,I received this book after my miscarriage. The title made me think it would help. Although he does say some things to validate my emotions. I feel he is really more focussed on trying to convince the reader of the validity of the baby. I didn't need that. My baby is as real as my other children except I didn't get to hold her. There are a few things that he says that TOTALLY conflict with my Catholic faith and pushed a few buttons. I also think he is more focussed on the healing after an abortion than a miscarriage or a stillborn. Overall I would say it's ok but not the help I needed. My baby is valid I know that it's trying to return to living my life I need help with.
3,So-so,"I'll hold you in heaven was okay, and it gave me a litle closure after my miscarriage. I think maybe it would of helped if i hadn't wait to read it after 6 months past my miscarriage, it may have been more effective if I had read it sooner after my miscarriage. I felt it kind of targeted more towards abortion, more than any other kind of infant loss."
5,Book has helped & comforted many,"We found this book when we lost our son Jason to a cord accident a week before our due date 12 years ago. We found this book very comforting. We always believed our son had gone to heaven and this book should us through scripture that God says he has too. We have been supplying this book (along with ""Empty Arms by Sherokee Isle"" to both our hospitals' OB ward and anyone we know in need of them for the past 12 years. We ourselves found them very comforting and helpful and have received only positive comments from people we have given them to. We have healed more than we could have imagined and we know it is because of the hope we have, which this book helps reinforce."
1,Waste of money,This book is not for anyone that has lost a child due to medical problems of the child or the mother. It's aimed more at a woman that chose to have an abortion for some reason other than medical necessity. I was hoping for a spiritual book about the loss of a child that was beyond your control. But instead I got a book focused on easing the guilt of an abortion. I found the analogies very ignorant. Like when they compared the loss of a baby to catching an earlier flight at the airport.
5,wonderful book,"This book covers many different areas of loss, which makes it a good read for anyone who has lost a child whether it be from miscarriage, abortion, ectopic, stillbirth, or infant death."
3,Read this and others,"After the stillbirth of our third son I had a lot of questions, mostly about where he is now and whether we would get to see him again some day in heaven. I wanted concrete answers, not just socially acceptable encouragement. This book goes into some good analysis of what scripture says on infant death, but I feel that it focused more on abortion than any other situation. Also, the analysis of scriptural passages could have been more thorough. I think his heart is in the right place but he could have made stronger arguments for his positions (like I read in other books). Overall I would recommend this book as one of the ones you should read if you've lost a child, but certainly don't stop here."
3,Definitely about taste.,"Daily mental calisthenics for the writer is a great idea. I found a few exercises in the book really clicked with me. Others, I just wrote on workbook page: ""I can do better than this."" and turned to my computer and wrote something that resonated with me.To me such exercises should be a mental stretching exercise. It is often kind of quirky. I think basically this author's brand of quirky and my brand are just really different.I probably wouldn't buy this book had I reviewed it more carefully ahead of my purchase. Honestly, if I were teaching a class of beginning writers, I might get the book from the library and steal some of the ideas (giving credit, of course), but, as a daily discipline for me - it's not worth the $13."
1,My Kingdom for a refund,"I was really disappointed in this book. Out of 366 exercises, maybe five were helpful. It was silly. Very silly. If my writing were a type of food, what would it be?? Is she serious? The first lines she gave as beginners for the exercises were, quite often, lines that I would hope NOT to see in a book I was reading. I almost expected to come across the line ""This one time, at band camp, I...""Her encouragements may be helpful to others, but I personally would not be helped by standing in my shower and yelling ""I am a writer!"" at the top of my lungs. I'll admit, at least part of my irritation is that the writer of this book is entirely too sunshiney for my taste. A positive attitude is a good thing, but I think she went overboard on the ""self-love"".This book was not my idea of helpful. Not at all. Go for the 3 AM Epiphany if you're having trouble finding ideas."
4,Action Packed,"This book is chalk full of prompts and ideas to get your brain working. It is also a very visually stimulating book with it's vivid colors and all the shapes and pictures utilized throughout.The entire book won't appeal to everyone (I don't know many that do), but it is a great book to get your brain thinking in different ways. And even if you don't like the exerices that are packed into this thick book you still can use the 'story starters' that are presented on almost every page.It's a little pricey at $20, but all in all it's a good thought provoker."
3,Good,"Visually, the book is fun to page through with lots of graphics and color, plus this book is definitely thick. The trade-off however is that there's very little room per page to write more than a few sentences, so it's not really a ""workbook"" in that sense. You'll still need a laptop, notebook, or PDA (w/folding keyboard) to capture your reponses to the prompts. Depending on what you like to write and what motivates or inspires you, this book will likely have some useful prompts for everyone, but I don't think it's an end-all/be-all for any writer. I like the concept and it's a graphic artist's dream, but in terms of content, the prompts are reminiscent of ""The Writer's Idea Book"" by Jack Heffron."
2,More fluff than stuff,"The ""workbook"" came and all the pages were printed in color. The spaces to write are not big enough, so you really have to get a separate notebook. The activities are okay, but not very inspiring for the advanced writer. Some were good, but not enough to make me want to keep this book. I plan to return it tomorrow."
5,Exercises Your Creativity,"I am enjoying this book. I have started at the beginning and going straight through. I am typing my work into a folder that I have opened on my computer. It keeps my mind active and gives me practice creatively putting thoughts into words. The book is creatively put together and can be used in a variety of ways to spur others also, particularly ""group"" creativity."
3,Interesting,"The exercises were fun and interesting, sometimes not enough room for all I had to say.A couple of exercises I didn't quite understand. Dark pages made it almost impossible to write on.However, I would recommend this book, for all the wonderful ideas in it."
2,may be good but type is almost unreadable,"I was browsing a copy of Cassells in a book store when trying to decide which Spanish Dict. to buy. This one came recommened to me, but the type is so blurry and badly printed--at least in the copy I was looking at--it was pretty much unuseable. Don't know if this is true for all copies of this book however."
3,Whew...,"I have to be honest -- I only did this routine once! I am almost 40 years old, I excercise 5-6 times weekly, I'm in pretty good shape, and this DVD was very, very hard for me. It really is a ""boot camp"" type of workout. If you like choreographed, aerobic-type routines, this is not for you. If you want a workout that really works you hard, you'll love it."
1,This DVD is AWFUL,"This DVD is terrible and I regret purchasing it. The worst thing is that during the cardio workout, the instructor is not going to the beat of the music AT ALL. She is so off. I personally cannot stand when workouts are not synched with the music. And the video looks like it was put together on a shoestring budget. Do not buy this video if you expect a nice, high-quality workout DVD."
5,Cool - Works well,"I do not use it as often as I thought I would, but it's cool and I am glad that I have it. When I do remember to bring it along, it's fun."
2,cute but video quality was not there...,I hooked it up to my 604 and recorded at the highest setting and the video quality was not that great. The avi file it creates is not divx or h264 - I really dont know what file it is even though they say its mp4 ... If I try to play the file on my mac using quicktime it will not display... in fact it crashes quicktime! I emailed tech support at Archos and never got an answer to this. I am hoping a firmware update will fix the video quality recorded onto the 604. My Casio Exlim does a better job and it uses sd media .The camera itself seemed fine the whole recording issue is coming from the 604.
5,Very Entertaining Video,"I thought that Princess of the Thieves was delightful! it was a wonderful continuing story of Robin Hood. I Thought Gwyn was a wonderful, brave girl, and she fit the part perfectly! They matched her and Robin Hood up perfectly, it was stunning, exciting and truly wonderful..they did an excellent job! I't s great family video, safe for children i would say over 9 and all the way up to adults..there was little language and a couple frightening scenes but if you like the story of Robin Hood you will enjoy this!"
3,Entirely entertaining,"Cute, but not stunning... I enjoy most of the Robin Hood genre, regardless of how far fetched, so I found this enjoyable too. Nice story, although Robin is portrayed as more of an arrogant, but unlucky nitwit. The never before heard from, Gwyn, is very well played and the story is entirely enjoyable; however, the sword play is unconvincing to say the least.A good tale, with a historically questionable theme, but it's Robin Hood-esque so there aren't a lot on constraints. I would have liked a different ending, but the one portrayed probably comes closer to what the ethics and constraints of times would have actually supported."
4,Keira Knightley's movie,"Indeed that is what this is. The story is somewhat predictable. The special effects were dismal. (WIth the exception of Keira knightley, the acting was not anything special. The scene which saved the movie was the archery scene. It had a predictable ending but an unpredictable way of getting there. With many plot twists it holds your attention but the ending you can predict. Keira Knightley, in her first of her many outstanding performances is an absolute joy to watch. The movie is saved by her honest and true acting. Just an outstanding effort on her part. This movie is fun to watch and I love watching it over and over."
5,Princess of Thieves,My daughter is getting this for Christmas and has looked for it for quite a while. It came in good time and it looks in good condition.
5,Very good,A nice continuation of the Robin Hood mythos. An action packed family film.One laughable thing though. In the movie Gwyn cuts her hair and pretends to be a boy. Everyone believes it. Pretty funny considering she's a rather beautiful young lady. No way you could mistake her for a boy.
4,No Regrets,"Not typically given into 'chick flicks' or adolescent films, this movie is well worth the purchase price and warrants repeated viewing.Any negative reviews are most likely from somebody who was looking for skin or graphic violence.Take a cold shower & some Xanax.This is a very good film.Nuke some popcorn, grab the kids and enjoy it."
3,"Okay , I've seen better","As I started watching it, I loved the begining. But as I wached the rest and realised that she didn't get the friar dude, I frowned! I mean the friar dude is so much cooler than the prince. For one thing the prince is ugly. The music was good, the acting was good ,the scenery was good. But the stroy line wasn't becaus she didn't get the friar dude!!!! pant...pant...pant.It's okay but I've seen better.(...)"
4,Princess Of Thieves,I Watched this movie a few years ago .I found it to be better than I had anticapated.The movie had plenty of action for those of us who like a action/adventure movie to get the adrenaline going.This is one I will enjoy for a long time.
3,robin hood live,"A slight twist on the ""Robin Hood"" tale. A decent movie but some of the scenes have been done numerous times before. Slightly predictable but still a good movie to watch on a lazy afternoon."
4,surreal kidflicks with anachronistic feminist undertow,"I love the fact that this movie teaches girls to fight and argue for equality, although I wouldn't want to be the one to break it to them that it's impossible to walk through 13th century English woods for days while maintaining flawless mascara, eyeliner, lip gloss, perfect hair...and a slim millenium-era atkins body."
1,Not good.,"My grandmother wanted me to order her some old candy bars she remembered from her childhood that were in a catalog she received called The Vermont Store. Found these were cheaper on amazon so I offered to help and ordered a case of 36 (to give some away to grandkids and such for easter) Well upon arrival I was very interested in trying these, I have to say, I think they are awful. Doesn't even remind me of chocolate, I tried each flavor and the horrible chocolate was so bad I could't even tell the difference between each flavor. I literally spit it all out after biting into them, and I do not consider myself picky in any way. I would stay away from these if you have never had them before."
1,Disappointed,This was the first candy bar I remember as a child and was excited to find it. I loved it then. This product is discolored and tastes bad. I have 36 bars of inedible candy.
3,Different,Got his to try as I like older candy.. Not very sweat so if your not into sweat chocolate this might be for you. Try it but don't expect the best of it if it was great it would be in your local store.
1,I don't even...,"I (sadly) received these as a ""gift"" from a relative and was severely disgusted at the quality of what I would hardly consider chocolate, let alone food. Trash this on the spot."
3,Not Bad,"This game has all the things you need for a fun College Football Game. To be honest, this is the first sports game I have ever purchased from 989 Studios. I normally was not a fan of 989 until Syphon Filter I & II came out. I figured they have the potential to create a good college football game for the PS2. The graphics are unique, the stadiums are very detailed and realistic. I just have to say though that I would bet that EA will come out with a better College Football game for the PS2 that will blow the socks off the game. I do not like the limited choices for camera angles. I have always been a fan of the left to right camera angle like EA gives you if you wish. But I can get use to it. Team logos are detailed and look good. Overall, if you buy this, you will not be throwing away money. Just keep it mind it is not a EA game but has the fun and excitement of a college football game."
3,NCAA GameBreaker 2001,"If you have to have a college football game this year, then this is your only choice. It is not a bad game, but for those of us who have already played Madden 2001 for the PS2 then you will be disappointed. The game play is fairly easy and not much of a challenge. It is fun but not up to the quality of the football games put out by EA Sports."
3,Just OK,"Well, the graphics are outstanding! Thank you PS2! But let's face it. You really feel like your at a college football game, but the in game options just aren't there. I have NCAA Football 98 for PC by EA sports and it has more options. Personally I think you should wate until EA comes out with NCAA Football 01' or 02' for the PS2. Also in this game the computer can catch a pass whenever they want to pretty much 90% of the time for 1st downs. Make sure you check other options like Madden or SSX before purchasing this game unless you really want a college football game for PS2 Now!"
1,not what i expected,I am a huge college football fan and I was really pumped about this game.I rented it lucky for me and the game is bad players walk through each other crowd is bad passingis way too complicated i suggest even if you are not an nfl fan but a college football fan go with madden and let us hope that ea puts out an ncaa football game in years to come
4,Great Game to Own,After the release of Gameday 2001 and it being so bad I was nervous on how good this game would be and it did not dissapoint. If you liked Gamebreaker 2000 on PS1 you will love this. The easy modes are easy to score on but that is why it is easy. The harder modes are more difficult but it is possible to score and play defense if you are good at the game. You just have to use a high variety of plays. In all it's a great game and would reccomend anyone to buy it.
1,RETURNED IT AS SOON AS THE UPS GUY LEFT,I gave this game one star instead of zero because it made a good frisbee.
5,TIGHT,"hey, this game was 1 of the best games i have played on ps2. So i highly recomend it to any that likes football. i give it 5 stars"
2,Didn't meet the expectations...,"At first, when anyone consider the price tag for THREE filters, one would say that it's an excellent deal. But don't be fooled.They all fit perfectly together and fit my lens perfectly. But once you try mounting one of these filters with other brand filters, problems would appear in every direction. The Circular Polarizer filter didn't fit the HOYA UV filter, so I managed to make the Polarizer filter just stick to the UV filter. But once I tried to remove it, it just wouldn't move at all. I was then forced to buy a new HOYA Circular Filter, which was a little more expensive than these filters together, but it was worth it.So just be sure to do more research on quality, rather than the price."
1,Very poor quality filters,These are very poor quality filters. The quality is so poor that threads do not match to my Nikon 18-200mm VR II Lens. The polarized filter is not rotating. It sold by 47th Street Photo [...]. When I complained on quality they sent the second set that turned out to be same bad as the first one. Looks like these people do not care about their reputation.
4,TR Torx Multi-Tool,"This is an absolute must have for anyone that may need to open up something that uses Tamper Resistant Torx screws, Xbox 360 repairs, or whathaveyou. Simple in design, very inexpensive, the only gripes would be its a little cumbersome to use because of the robust design. But, work it does, and for the price you cant beat it."
5,Another Great Book,Another great book by Susan Jeffers. I enjoy anything from her. She seems to fully understand how to bring people up.
3,Disappointing,"I have read and highly appreciated two of Jeffers previous books: ""Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway"", and ""Dare to Connect"". I would give both of those books 5 stars. Unfortunately, as good as Dare to Connect is, it remains out of print and, I believe, this was the motivating force behind writing End the Struggle. It is basically a merging of the two books, yet it does not seem to have the energy and intensity, often coming off a bit naive or pollyannaish.For me, it was just a review of what I'd read in the previous two books and therefore of little value. It's not fair for me to rate it lower on that alone, however. No, it's lower energy combined with the publisher's trick of reintroducing ""Dare to Connect"" principles (which is available online used) is what bothered me. We see this a lot. An author writes another book that is basically a rehash of another, or tries to present the same views a little differently just so the public will think it's a ""new"" book."
1,Worst purchased software product I have ever loaded,Moneymaker himself wouldn't play this game. Why? He'd be embarrassed getting knocked off the first table or repeatedly bluffed off hands when AI players call pot-sized bets for half their stack with nothing and will re-raise you with just a K.I went to the web-site to see if I could download a patch as apparently this game shipped without any logic. I'm amazed that some sites give this product a 3.8/10 rating - based on what? Afraid to upset the poker community?worst.game.ever
2,lousy beginning levels,"The beginning level players call trip all ins without a draw and catch more often than not, leaving you broke. Therefore it is almost impossible to get to the tournaments and frustrates players honing skills."
3,Is this realistic ?,"I have a freind who plays Texas Holdem all the time. I thought I should brush up on this game so I wouldn't go broke on poker night.Not ever playing this game with real people I was wanting something very realistic. All though the cards are pretty hard to see; unless your sitting right on top of your monitor. I slowly progressed up the ranks to season mode. Like your other reviewer stated. As long as You stay patient You can easily place/win money in the season modes. The closer You get to playing "" Chris Moneymaker "" the more your opponents cards are drawing trips and full houses almost back to back !! Good poker players always say that there is so much skill involved in texas holdem. But there really is quite a bit more luck involved than they would like to freely state.In this game You can get cash prizes for placing seventh in a table of ten? If You can't place seventh out of ten players,please don't play Texas Holdem for real money.Unless the buy-in is $5.00 Tim"
3,Very hard!,"This book has 100 chess problems in it with a choice of three answers. Each correct answer is worth 25 points, you don't get any points for other answers even though they may also be good moves. The points are used to discover what your elo rating is. This book is not for people who are looking for casual chess problems to solve. The problems are very hard."
2,poor quality,We did not use it at all: the hairs were falling out so my daughter decided to go without it.
1,Terrible,"Cheaper than I could have anticipated. It came out of the package with chunks of hair falling out. It's also way redder than the picture, even in person the colors on the package and the actual wig are wildly different. Returned and got a refund."
2,"It's an OK wig, but...","I got this wig for a Halloween party. It was pretty cheap and shipped real fast. It was tangled and weird when I opened it, so I tried to comb it out, but the hair falls out if you comb, so I stopped. It never looked OK after putting it on, in places there was no hair, and other places there was too much. Also it's too small and kept sliding off my head the whole time. All in all it was OK for the price. It's in the garbage now...couldn't wear it a second time."
5,great for the reluctant reader,"My son was reluctant to read in his elementary school days. This series caught his attention and by the time he finished all the books in the series that we could find he was intrigued enough with reading to go on to other books. Now, he is a high school senior with stellar SAT scores. I'll give partial credit to Henry and Mudge!"
5,Good classic book,This is a good series for 1st graders who are looking for small adventures with a loving friend.
5,Mudge was little?,"My son loved all books Mudge, but the chance to seen him join the family as a puppy was too fun."
5,Funny and sweet,"My sons adore Henry and Mudge. These books are fun for them to read, and the classic ""boy and his dog"" characters are very endearing, particularly big, drooly Mudge. Well-written and entertaining, this series is great for kids who think they don't like to read or who have trouble reading, because they're funny and easy enough so that the child won't get bored or frustrated trying to read it. A definite must-have for any kid's bookshelves."
3,THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD WE READ IT TWO TIMES!,"We give this book Henry and Mudge 3 stars because it had a lesson. It's about how to treat a pet. Alos,how to love not just people, but dogs and cats too."
5,The perfect solution to bathing my 6 year old with a fractured wrist.,The plastic bag and tape got old really fast. This was a lifesaver and I wish the orthopedic who casted my daughter knew about this option.
3,Average,"I cut the tendon in my thumb. I needed something to use to shower. I was excited when I read the reviews on this product about being able to use it in the pool/hot tub. We had a vacation planned prior to my accident. I was happy to think I would be able to use it to join in the fun on our trip. Opening hole is medium size, ok if you don't have a large cast or bandage on your hand/arm. Ok if you do, however, you have to stretch the opening larger to fit it in. May require an additional person to help you.I tried to use it in the hot tub, at first seemed like it was air tight, however, my bandage ended up getting wet. Very disappointed.I would buy again for shower use, but not for use for pool/hot tub as noted."
2,Tore after a few uses,"The opening is extremely small when you get it out of the box. I could barely fit my other arm through it, let alone my casted arm. It worked really well the first 2 times, but the rubber stretched out and developed tears. There are 1 inch tears on both sides in therubber. It's no longer airtight (although I still wear it in the shower since it's better than nothing). You can make it work, but I expected better."
3,Should be a smaller-than pediatric size available,"This item was good enough but not great. I bought it for my 4-year old and it generally kept the water out while swimming. We had some dampness in the cast when the protector was removed so I was not completely satisfied. If there were a size smaller than pediatric, I think that would have worked much better."
3,Not what I thought,"I bought this product so my daughter could snorkel on our vacation. Her cast was wet with the 2nd use. It would work to protect your cast from getting splashed, but it did not work for swimming."
3,a delightful present to Kay's fans,"I thought that this was a charming gift to those of us who love Kay Scarpetta and her ""family"" I read Winter Table early Thanksgiving Day Morning. It reminded me, in way, of Capote's Christmas Memory.The humanity of Lucy and Officer Moreno came through in this short story making it gentle read.Perhaps I will attempt the ""recipes"".......it really doesn't matter. What matters is sharing quiet moments with this normally ""high powered"" group of characters."
3,A behind the scenes look at Kay btwn books.,"If you enjoy Kay and Pete, you'll enjoy this brief intermediate book about life at Scarpettas'winter table. This book is not intended to teach you to cook or solve mystries but it gives you an inside look to the direction of the next Scarpetta novel."
3,a bit light on,This is a Christmas stocking filler. A feel-good story and a few recipes. The recipes leave a bit to be desired as the quantities are extremely vague.
4,A cookbook with a plot,"I enjoyed the book. It was low key and relaxing - a nice read while curled up in front of the Christmas tree. Since I never measure when I cook, I didn't miss knowing how many teaspoons of what were included. The ingredients were creative and my family loved the stew. This was a nice Holiday book."
1,Kay Scarpetta should stay out of the kitchen!,"Patricia Cornwell's foray into the ""cooking detective"" field is a flat souffle. She should take a few lessons from my favorite author of this sub-genre, Diane Mott Davidson, and include fewer recipes and more story. This is a cookbook masquerading as a story. I was so disappointed, I returned this book to the local library without finishing it."
1,Your kidding right?,"I loved Cornwell's first 4 novels. No question they were well done. I just can't figure out what she has been doing since. Winters Table, I took back to the store after only the second chapter. This is not the same writter who once had me on pins and needles waiting for her next book."
1,Don't waste your money...,"Scarpetta's Winter Table could've been written by a high school english class. The prose is horrible, the plot is pointless, and the recipes can't be recreated."
1,scarpettas winter table,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. It should have been offered as a freebie with her latest novel. I admit I am also disappointed that her increasingly right wing political views and disgust for Washington DC and sometimes convenient disregard for accuracy in regard to the District are finding there way into her Kay Scarpetta books which despite the author I still enjoy. However, this so-called cookbook was thoroughly trivial and little more than a pamphlet. At the same time I bought another compilation of mystery writer recipes entitled ""A Taste of Murder"" which was a ""real"" cookbook and whose profits went to help the hungry. Quite frankly I think Scarpettas winter table was quickly written for a quick profit. I also realize the author is developing a reputation for going after her critics so I guess I stand a risk by criticizing her. She recently wrote to the Washington Post criticizing them for categorizing her as a mystery writer. Go figure."
1,"Neither a cook book, not a thriller","If Patricia Cornwell's name hadn't been on this book, (and I too, don't think she wrote it) I wouldn't even have bothered with it. It doesn't have recipes, just generalities about throwing food together. It is not even a story....there is no plot or storyline. So what is it? That is the only mystery here. My advice is don't waste your time."
1,A Christmas rip-off.,A poorly written money-maker from an author who knows she can sell anything by name alone. She ought to be ashamed! Even the recipes are worthless.
3,Disappointing,"I agree that an author should be allowed to venture away from her normal genre and style. But when did Cornwell forget how to spell? I truly do not believe this book was written by her. It is stilted where her others brim with life and real characters. Makes me wonder if I really do want ""Food to Die For"". By the way, the blatant spelling error was in Marino's eggnog. That's egg YOLKS not YOKES. I haven't even finished reading this and don't know that I will. Okay, yes I will, just for the recipes."
2,Was this the real Patricia Cornwell?,It is hard to believe that this book was written by the same author that held me captive throughout all the Kay Scarpetta novels. While I thought it was fun to get a glimpse of the characters'lives behind the scenes and see hints of photographs I was disappointed because I expected much more. An expensive cookbook with no real recipes.
2,Beware the chicken soup,"Just one comment. This is not a cookbook, per se, but descriptions of various things Ms. Scarpetta has cooked in her down time in the novels. Don't expect ""add 1/4 tsp. water "" or ""chop 2 lbs. onions"" or the dreaded ""garnish with Mandarin orange sections, IF DESIRED"". (What I Desire in a recipe is someone to do the dishes.) This is OK, tho annoying to dummy beginner cooks. Just beware the chicken soup. One cannot simmer boneless chicken breast for hours without it turning into hard tasteless little bits of cardboard!"
1,"Yes, you really do have to be kidding.","This ""book"" is in fact over priced at $20.00. I read it courtesy of the local library. It is solely for those with literally nothing better to do. Cornwell should have known better. The only believeable character in the entire volume is Jimmy Simpson. It would truely have been great if Cornwell had kept Jimmy on in the succeeding Scarpetta novels. The kid would have been good for Marino. But she has apparently been intending to get rid of Marino all the time in spite of this."
2,it is a fun read but not much substance..,"... If I had to spend [money]to get this book, I would be quite disappointed because it is so short. It seems to me the author put this together in a hurry to make some money. It is not bad but not much in there. I enjoyed reading it but the plot was a bit [stale.]"
1,"Ms. Cornwell, are you in there??","I simply refuse to believe this book was written by the same Patricia Cornwell who gave us Postmortem, and Point of Origin among others. The writing style is completely different, and the characters, are well, out of character. The character of Kay Scarpetta kept being refered to as ""Scarpetta"". Such as, ""Scarpetta stirred the stew."" Now where does Dr. Kay ever get refered to as ""Scarpetta"" in other novels? It was just too odd! Save your money, and pray the real Dr. Kay Scarpetta makes an appearance in a book soon."
5,love it,"This is a great book quickly received, many times we can be partnering with the accuser and not even realize it"
5,Excellent,"Whether interested in homophobia, politics, or gays inthe military, Mixner's book is excellent. From hisstruggles with his own homophobia to his struggles withthe White House, Mixner shows us the personal and thepolitical and the sometime disastrous mix."
3,good book kinda of long,it was a good book for the most part but it kinda of ran on and on i still have a copy of it around some where
5,This is a great book and really a terrific idea!,"I really like how The ULTIMATE Wedding/Ceremony Workbook For The Planning-Impaired gives the engaged couple freedom to be as creative and as daring as they can live with.I also found myself getting kind of excited as I anticipated how the bride and groom would watch their wedding plans come together in a very real and concrete way. Of course, I'm a very visual person so this really appeals to me.I loved that you included sample prayers and vows - it gives them a chance to realize that this is an important ceremony, as well as a sacred time in their lives, and presents each of them with the opportunity to seriously think about how to make it meaningful for themselves on a personal level.The book is also casual and relaxed and the writing nice and big so it really has that workbook feel instead of the 'how to do it the right way' type of message. This is a great book - I know my son and future daughter-in-law will love it!"
5,"This book is fun, helpful, and makes planning a breeze.","There are so many details related to planning any size wedding that having a book like this one to guide you is a definite plus. While I consider myself a very organized person, I still would have overlooked things like melting the wax off the wick of the unity candle beforehand, and having a basket available for cards at the gift table. We especially enjoyed designing our very own wedding ceremony from the wonderful selections provided. Reverend Amy has a lighthearted writing style that makes this book enjoyable to read as well as helpful. This one is a worthwhile investment for any wedding."
5,Ceremonies that speak directly to the love of a couple,"I'm a non-denominational minister and I bought this book because I was interested in expanding my collection of ceremonies. This book was perfect. I found ceremonies to suit many different situations and they were all very heartfelt and personal. Since I've been using them, people often ask me if the couple wrote the ceremony themselves because it sounds so much like them. The whole book was outstanding!"
3,5 to 20 year time line,"Medicine's snails pace depsite enormous expenditures on things like cancer research has always baffled me as a lay person... that similarity to Kessler made me appreciate his search. As one reviewer noted, this would have been a good long version article vs. a book. To cut to the chase, his search ends with early detection being the holy grail, with the ""end of medicine"" at least 5 years away, and probably 10 to 20 years. It's a quick and reasonably interesting read for other lay people. I doubt medical professionals would find it all that interesting."
2,Skip it,I enjoyed Andy Kessler's book about finance (Wall St Meat) but this one is just silly. It seems to show the wisdom of the old writer's saw about sticking with something you know about. This book is like sitting in a bar listening to a drunken bore try to impress you with all the little bits and pieces he heard at a hospital that day. I couldn't wait to get to the end so I could throw it out.
3,Intriguing Idea,"As a Research Associate working in DTI and fMRI, I was intrigued by this book because Mr. Kessler talks about using imaging techniques for diagnostics. He is looking for ways for medicine to scale (and references his knowledge of the tech industry frequently).The book is written in a very informal manner, but there are bits and points which make it worthwhile to read.I am always frustrated by typos and this book likely used a spell-checker, but was poorly read over to look for correctly spelled words that did not match the sentence. For the price, I would wait for the paper back edition.However, he does mention many centers and key people in them. Maybe this book (for me at least) was a good way to look at who else in my industry is hiring."
2,find better ways to update,there a re a lot of articles that indeed say the same thing in fewer words. Don't waste your time. It's not worth to read it even if you receive it as a gift.
3,A little dissappointed,The author obviously knows a lot about the world of microelectronics and wants to learn about modern medicine. I found the conclusions at the end very interesting but not what I expected from the title.
3,"A bit glib, but somewhat on the mark","As a HMO Board member and a past Chairman of an over 500 bed hospital, the desire to decrease costs without a diminution of care, rermains a constant challenge. Mr. Kessler in his search, comes across a number of possible solutions that may bear fruit in the future. These discussions are, in my opinion, well worth the price of the book He also addresses some of the self referral patterns among certain types of practices thatcould be construed to be selfserving.A quick read that asks more questions than it answers."
3,Some nuggets of value in with a lot of chaff,"Andy Kessler needs a proofreader. There are so many misspellings and misused words in this book it is silly. Kessler's ""drug eluding stent"" for instance should probably be a ""drug eluting stent""... at least last time I checked my facts.The name dropping and language used in the text is annoying; why can't he just talk normally about the facts and options without trying to be the 7th grade crack up?But mixed in all that is a quick run down of some of the most important technologies today. A thin thread of information, to be sure, but you can follow the technological name dropping to other resources.And the theme of how difficult it is to really take charge of your own diagnosis and fully understand your health is a valid one. We are all generally beholden to the medical establishment to provide us with the knowledge of what is going on in our bodies. A future where that information is more accessible would be a good one, I think."
1,Irritating rubbish,"Glib, shallow, obnoxious, and peppered with inaccuracies. Kessler is one of those writers who is so bumptiously full of himself, with prose so slick that his writing is devoid of all credibility. He interviews a lot of interesting people, but apparently never managed to reach a level of understanding that would allow him to ask the interesting questions. Each chapter follows the same disappointing pattern - just when things get might get interesting, Kessler apparently reaches the limit of his attention span and bops on to the next topic."
2,The End of Medicine,I think the title of the book is misleading. It is stories of the author's experiences and not very instructive or interesting.It was not very well written.Save yout time and money.
2,INSTUMENTAL R&B,"I agree with the first reviewer. This is strictly Memphis Underground music. If you want to hear a three way Tenor Sax battle in a jazz groove without Shirley. Try SOUL BATTLE Oliver Nelson with Jimmy Forest and King Curtis. Perdido,Soul Street etc. Don't punch in anybody's name just SOUL BATTLE"
2,It's quite lame...,"This is not Shirley's best work, and one must wonder how this recording came together. Except for Billy Taylor's ""I Wish I Knew..."" and what became the Almighty Burner's ""More Today than Yesterday"", its really just some pop tunes featuring yesterday's sax cross-overs. No real jazz or sould organ emerges. Shirley's genius stays hidden. And only 7 cuts for an out-of-print price? Save your bucks for ""Queen of the Organ"", ""Blue Flames"", etc."
1,I Can't Believe How Bad This was!,I don't buy books if I don't think I'll like them.Imagine my chagrine at this book I could scarcely finish!I think it is one of the worst things I've forced myself to finish because I paid retail for it.The lead characters are self indulgent people who caused the death of their siblings either on purpose or unintentionally.These aren't people I felt sorry for or rooted for in any way.
2,ugh,"i thought that this would be an entertaining read, especially since it was from tor. boy was i surprised to find it slow and unappealing. they built everything up about these two people destined to be together and they didn't end up together. It was probably supposed to be romantic and show how these characters grew and blah, blah, blah. All i got out of it was a loss of $7 and a headache. if you are really determined to read this i would suggest taking a ride to the local library and saving yourself your money."
4,Windwalker,"""Windwalker"" by Natasha Mostert is a well written story of star-crossed soul mates finally getting together. But broken apart by their separate destinies to live in England and South Africa. Not as good as ""Season of the Witch"" published this year. Natrasha keeps improving and is unparalled and unrivalved by any other writer. Great fantasy made absolutely real and sensuous. I want to read all her future books. Also please reprint all the books in paperback. . Windwalker would make a good movie or BBC -type TV program. three episodes. Even more so would ""Season of the Witch"" as a movie or BBC miniseries."
5,Sydney Drew,This book has a mystery I want to solve badly! Its right up my alley because it involves a mysterious lake and hidden treasure. This was one of my favorites so far in the Nancy Drew series. Nancy is hanging out with Bess and George more than they usally do to solve a mystery which I like. And the mystery was well formed. Anyone would love to read this book that is so mysterious.
5,Old Classic,"Trixie Belden and Nancy Drew dominate the search engines for most mystery stuff written for young adults. I suppose the reason may relate to their both being timeless classics. If you like these stories, you also have many more to choose from.In this book, originally published around 1934, Nancy is faced with solving a mystery concerning a pair of adopted babies. As usual, Nancy sticks her nose into somebody else's business and comes out smelling like a rose. This is a good story, with dated dialogue, but a likable, wholesome character. I recommend this to any mystery lover aged 9-12, and perhaps beyond. I'm an adult, and still enjoy reading about her exploits."
5,the brocken lockets significance,this is an exiting nancy drew mystery!it starts off by nancy getting a key to a house on misty lake and the exitment starts there.in this mystery nancy tries to help cecily curtis find her family tresure wich she thinks is hidden near a place called pudding stone lodge near where the girls are staying.nancy also helps cecily by helping her to find out if cecily boy friend niko van dyke is being cheated out of his record company. dangerous and perplexing events occur when nancy see's a red headed girl that resembles cecily always running away from them when nancy and her friends see them.when nancy finds a half locket in an old row boat that leads nancy to many suggestions.is the red headed girl being held prisinor with the dishonest driscolls who live is pudding stone national lodge?or is she partners with the driscolls?the way nancy finds the answers and the way she solves the mystery is very exiting!
5,Uplifting and Encouraging !!!!!,A wonderful book that thoroughly uplifts and encourages. It left me with a sense of wonder and gratitude and an insight into how in very strange ways things fell into place in my own life.....
5,Thoughtful,I originally ordered this book because this author is a pen name for one of my favorite Christian Fiction writers. I have enjoyed this book. When feeling down I pick it up and read a short story of how someone came into a life and helped that person out and I do believe in Angels. It is uplifting when you are down or just need a reminder that God is there for us whether himself or through an angel.
3,The Who Should Sue,"While this is a decent graphic novel, it offers so much that The Who album (and subsequent film) QUADROPHENIA already covered that it felt redundant."
3,Art 5 stars. Story 1 star,"This is a decent book, but only because of the striking B&W; art work and great layout. For some reason it is set in the future (complete with hoverbikes, apparently the only advance the future has brought us), but the setting makes no difference to what is a predictible story with a simplistic moral ending. As a coming of age story, you see the outcome of the story from the beginning, and Gibbon doesn't offer any twists or turns to liven up the story line. If it were not for the ""hook"" of mods in the future, there would be no reason to pick this up.That said, the art is amazing, and the layout makes an other wise dull story worth reading. Skip the hardcover and pick it up in paperback if you like his earlier work or are interested in mod culture."
5,Do yourself a favor and-,"give Gibbons a chance as a writer! With past works like World's Finest and the first Batman Vs. Predator series Gibbons has proved he CAN write as well as he draws.The Originals is one of the best drawn and written graphic novels I've read in a long time.The graphic novel industry needs more Dave Gibbons and personal works like, The Originals. Pick it up. You won't be disappointed!"
3,1950s 'Teens in trouble' movie with hoverbikes,"Beautiful art and page layouts, but I thought the story was not all that original. It felt like I was watching a rebellious youth movie from the '50s. There was a distinct British vibe to it all from what little I've seen of UK gangster movies. Unilke a Hollywood movie, though, I was pleased that the ending was left open and didn't tie up everything in a neat package."
4,time series for business,"To make this review short, I will say that I agree with all seven points made by the reviewer from New York, NY, whomever he or she may be. Franses is clear, concise, authoritative and up-to-date on all the advances.I particularly like the nice coverage of GARCH models that are new to me. It is a great introductory text especially for economics majors. For more advanced books and other treatments of time series consider Kennedy's fourth edition of ""A Guide to Econometrics"" or the suggestion from reviewer ""New York, NY"". Also my listmania list on time series will give you several sources to look at."
3,Not for the beginner,I have a limited background in statistics and have taken only a single course in econometrics that did not cover time series models. I purchased this book to perform some independent research. I found the lag operator notation confusing and not intuitive. A better introduction is in Chapters 21 and 22 of Basic Econometrics by Gujarati.
5,Classic,"Remembering when you first heard Vini and his guitar work is still a wonderful experience for me. I think his singing goes really well with his work in this album. Any other singer would just do no justice to the atmospheres he creates. This is tied with ""the return.."" as my favorite album of his though."
1,Do not waste your money!,"Very Cheap and dull. The blades are flembsy, the handles are cheap. Used it once and put it in the garage for the next yard sale."
4,Good knife set.,Good all-around affordable knife set for general cooking. The knives were not as sharp as I expected them to be but they cut very well. A couple of the steak knives don't fit into the block very well. Other than that I was pleased with the purchase.
2,Cheap plastic handle.,Cheap set of knifes. I had them for two months and the plastic handles were starting to crack on two knives that had been used the most.
1,"Tiny, tiny and tiny!","These knives are suited for 5-7 year-olds (which is ironic because they couldn't cut a tomato!). The steak knives are no wider than my pinky finger. It's the worst set I've ever purchased. To be clear, my old knives cut better than these. Sending them back."
3,Just okay,The knives are great. The carrier is a little cheap looking. Would be better in a darker wood or black
2,so disappointed,I have had Ginsu knives in the past so I was excited when I saw a whole block set at such a great price.....I ordered them and received them with the boning knife missing....Amazon was great and immediately sent me a replacement set. First time using one of the knives to cut meat a piece of the plastic handle broke off and all I was doing was cutting meat. I decided that if they broke this soon I was not going to be happy with such a cheap set. I will now look for another set at a little higher price point. Needless to say I returned these and am still waiting for a credit from Amazon but I am sure they will give me one I have never had a problem with them.
2,Not what they claim,"I did read the reviews and that's why I choose these knives. Maybe I got a bad set, but they are lousy. They cut so poorly it is dangerous to use them. As soon as I can, I am replacing them. And not with another Ginsu set."
4,For it's price! It's a great product!,"All the knives are good and work the way you'd expect them to work. The only con of this knife set is the scissors that came with it. It's made pretty cheaply and doesn't look like will hold up for too long.I'm not sure how long the knives would hold their sharpness but for now, it'll do the job.1 star taken away for cheap scissors."
1,Loose and rusted within a month!,I loved these knives....:( Unfortunately within a month the handles were loose and even after religious hand-washing/drying...rust! Contacted their customer support...they would replace the knives for 3$ each...hmmm...don't think so! NEVER AGAIN!!! Too bad really as they started out a dream.
2,Last less than a year!,"I didn't know that after only 8 months these are rusty as crap and I don't even soak them in water. I don't understand how this happens, but I'm not going to use a product if it going to rust and contaminate my food. I would not recommend these to a friend or family member and I thought this was a good company..."
2,You get what you pay for,Wooden block was scratched...thought knives were rather on cheap side. Would not recommend for regular use. Will be giving to my son to use in his first apartment.
2,You get what you Pay for,"Nice knife set for the cost, but not exactly what I was looking for. blades rusted (slightly) after 1 use, only 1 knife is truly sharp--the others have the forever sharp saw blade stuff going on, so you still have to push hard and saw."
4,Great Knives for a Great Price,"I ordered these knives based on the price factor, but also the quantity factor as well. I was trying to get as much as I could for as little money as possible. I was lucky enough to accomplish both! I had heard of Ginsu knives before as being sold on TV, but had never actually owned any. These are some great knives for the price! They come razor sharp out of the box and so far they have stayed that way for me. The knife block was a huge attraction as well. I am really happy with these knives, and while there are certainly much better quality knives out there, you will also be paying an arm and a leg and get half of what you get with this set."
4,"Extremely Sharp, good balance, and good handles","These knives are very good. They make short work of fruits, veggies, and meats. Heck I have even used the Japanese cleaver in a few home craft projects. I had them almost a year now and they are still sharp as the first day that I received them. I shouldn't need another set for at least a decade."
2,rusted,"after washing the metal became discolored and appears even rusted in several spots. However, I have only had these for several months so no complaints regarding sharpness. not a good value."
2,Unhappy!,I own a set of these knives. I purchased another set for my mother for Christmas. I am very disappointed with the quality of this set. The handles exceed the metal of the tang by a noticeable amount of space on every knife. They look sloppy and thrown together. The craftsmanship of these knives is very poor I. The particular set I recently received.
4,"Sharp, but not as sharp as professional blades","Bought this because of the rave reviews this received + the good price. Barely use them except for the steak knives now and then. I thought this would give me professional level cutting power but compared to my custom made knives these aren't even close. Good show item, I guess."
2,the knives began rusting after the first wash,"We bought these knives as our first knife set for our new apartment and were so excited about them, but I guess I should have looked at online reviews first. These knives began rusting after the first wash, and every single one we've used has rust spots now."
4,Good knives for a Good Price,"These knives seem like a great deal - so far I have had no problems.I know knives can be very expensive so I was very pleased to find these - with good reviews - for such a good price. When they were delivered, one knife had a part of its handle chipped off. I contacted Ginsu & they sent me a replacement knife for free!"
5,"Great Price, Good Quality","Needed to get my oldest son & his girl friend a kitchen knife set. Using their fingers wasn't ""cuttin"" it anymore. Highly suggest this unit. Son & GF loved it."
5,Great knives,"This should go without saying, but these knives are very sharp. [I know, duhhhh], but we were used to our old set where you could throw them in with the other dishes and wash them together. not so with these, my wife has cut herself twice, i think she has learned to just save these things for last.The knives work very well, it would be very hard to find a better value than these. Sharp, durable, a very good value."
1,Horrible knives!,"I'm not sure if my product was just defective, but these are the dullest knives I have ever used! I have 12 year old Henkels that I was trying to replace. They have NEVER been sharpened and are quite dull. These knives are duller than those old ones. It almost seems like the company forgot to sharpen my knives, especially after all of the great reviews on here. I am returning them as they are obviously defective and I think I'll just sharpen my old knives as they are obviously much better quality."
3,At least they are sharp,"These knives looks good, and are very sharp. The reason why I gave them 3 stars is because they are notdishwasher safe. I put 2 of them in the dishwasher (I use Cascade), and the black on the handles faded. I then rubbed some olive oil on the handes to try to get the color back, so far it worked. But I will not put them back in the dishwasher, I will wash by hand from now on. ;("
1,Rust quickly,"I bought these knives two weeks ago and after three times through the dishwasher they are already beginning to rust. The knives advertise stainless steel, but they clearly are not. If you are looking for a knife set that will last more than a couple weeks, I wouldn't advise buying this set. They were pretty nice for that two week period though...."
2,Rusting after 30 days of use,Received for Christmas and now am searching for another set as rust spots have started to appear. Don't assume that because this is a top rated product that the product quality lives up to the rating.
3,Good starter collection,"This is the first knife block I have ever purchased and while I do like the idea, the knives aren't very sharp and seem to rust a little bit in the dishwasher. I definetell recommend handwashing these. And I will be purchasing a sharpener."
3,Budget set,Just a budget set of knives. I really got these because we didn't have any steak knives. I would only recommend this set if you already have some good every day cutting knives.
4,Useful and compact,I dont use the meat knives but otherwise it very useful and compact. And it looks pretty in my kitchen too.
1,RUST,DO NOT BUY... Will Rust within a month. everytime I wash rust rust and more rust... What a waste of money
1,"RUSTY, Ginsu knives ??? really - I think they are knock offs.","I purchsed these knives when I moved into my new place, so excited about them and after one wash they are rusty! Not kidding they have rust spots. Just to clarify I have washed by hand and dried, I have washed in the dishwasher and let airdry, still rusty.I honestly think they are knockoffs. I feel ripped off and lesson learned I will NEVER buy from this seller again."
2,Rusted,I bought these knives in December and they already have rust marks. I bought these because I thought a brand like Ginsu would be great - I was wrong.
2,OK... Not like the descriptions say,Almost half of the knifes are not sharp at all. It look me 4 of them before finding the biggest one that was sharp to cut a piece of chicken. I say save your money and invest in a higher quality set.
1,Cheap and dull,"After I used them on the second day, one of the knives already got rusty and dull. These look really cheap and do not have good quality either. I wouldn't recommend this set to anyone."
4,Great knives for a good price,"Just got these knives about 2 months ago. So far, I love them. They're really sharp and seem to be durable knives."
4,I like em'.,"This knife set is really my first ""set"" I've purchased. I'd like to give it 5 stars but I have nothing to compare them to. My only complaint is that the Santoku Knife is flimsy. I replaced it immediately with a heavier duty knife. Also the Kitchen Scissors are terrible and your best off purchasing a good pair to replace them."
4,For the price why complain?,"Let's be honest, I'm not a chef. Hell, I hardly can cook. These make what little I attempt easier and work as well for my purposes as the $200 set my ex had. Sure they will rust if you're not careful with them, I just use them, wash them and dry them. Seems fine. If they ever wear out I'll just buy more."
5,"Great Knives, Great Price","Wow, I was going to spend a fortune on a set of knives that I wasn't sure would be worth it and then read the review of this set and decided why not try them. They are fantastic, best set of knives I've ever owned and they are sharp w/o sharpening!"
3,Handles are a joke,"The blades get three stars because they are sharp. If that's all your looking for this set will do. The handles however are a joke. When you lift any of the knives it feels like lifting a light butter knife. It's actually pretty funny how cheap it looks. The price definitely matches the product. When you think that each item is about $2 to cover the $30 cost you get a picture of the quality. If your on a tight budget, this would be a 5 star product."
2,Cheap plastic handles...,"I've had this product for three months now. In just the last month, the plastic on the handles of the knives has started chipping away. There is no reason for this because I always wash them by hand in the sink and am generally pretty gentle with them. Lately I go to pick up an knife and another piece will fall off. I guess you get what you pay for. I will admit that they are very sharp and have stayed sharp during the time I've had them."
5,Love these knives,"I have had these knives for about 3 weeks now. For the price you can't beat them. I love them, as they are very sharp and very good for chopping anything. These are the best knives I have seen anywhere for this amount of money. Also have a lifetime warranty. No one would go wrong purchasing this set of knives."
4,"Good product, good value","Sharp knives, no need to sharpen. However, there are too many saw-style knives in this set and only two classic, straight blade type knives. Most of us are used to the straight blade knives. The saw is a waste, unless you cut animal bones all the time."
1,waste,I had these about 15 years ago and wanted to replace them. Complete waste of money. Rust after the first wash.

1,Truly a shockingly terrible knife set,These weren't even sharp out of the box – much less after two years of very occasional use (once a month or so - they're at a vacation home). I feel terribly throwing them in the trash - what a waste of resources - but I'm not sure what else to do with them.
2,Rusty,"These knives are decently constructed and are fair value. Unfortunately as others have said, these rust quite badly. It was after only 1 use and one cylce (on normal/regular) in the dishwasher. For that reason, I cant reccomend this product. Spend the extra money and get something that will actually last."
2,Worst Customer Service Ever,"I bought this knife set just over a month ago. While I am very happy with the quality of the knives in the set, the santoku knife arrived with a broken handle. I followed the warranty directions that were in the box and contacted the manufacturer immediately. They asked me to email them my receipt from Amazon and pictures of the broken handle, which I did. Since that time, there has been no communication from them. I have yet to receive the replacement knife they had promised on the phone. They did not reply to the email or contact me via phone or snail mail. I am very disappointed in their poor customer service. If this issue is not resolved this week, I'll return the set and ask for a refund."
2,Ok I guess,"If you know anything about good knives, you know they should have a good heft to them, these knives do not. They are quite sharp right out of the box, but if you are slicing raw meat, or cheese....well...just don't even try these knives. They work pretty well for the price though and the steak knives are fine(I would actually stick with these over higher end steak knives), unless you like really rare steak.I would but the steak knives again but not the rest of the set, especially if like me you like to buy block cheese and cut raw meat for your meals. They just feel so flimsy (shears are terrible and broke the 3rd time i used them) and I am afraid of breaking the handle when I cut anything harder than an apple. Would be 1 star but steak knives are 4 star so they saved it."
3,They became dull after two years,"They were good for a while, but eventually dulled out just like every other set of knives that I have bought. They are worth the price, but they don't last forever."
4,Ginsu? Really,"These are pretty sharp knives and for the price, they're actually pretty good. I've had mine for a month now and the only time I've been disappointed is when I noticed a spot of rust on one knife, but hey, I've been putting them in the dishwasher too. Regardless, I've cut tomatoes, chicken, carrots, etc., and have been pleased with them. Every one of these knives are serrated which would have been disappointing, but I already have a good quality chef's knife. But oddly enough, I haven't used that knife in a while, I keep going for the Ginsu knives."
1,Rusting after only 4 months,"These knives are rusting after only 4 months of regular use. I did think they were going to be the most amazing knives in the world, but I did expect them to not rust within the first months of use. Not good."
1,Sharp but rusty,I bought these knives for my new house and have had them for a month or so and half of them are already rusted after just a couple uses. They are pretty sharp and cut great but I dont get it how can they rust so quickly. I wouldnt recommend them because I am sure you can find better knives that dont rust this quickly and this easily.
1,No good!!,First of all I only recieved the knives...it was missing the block. Then...although the knives are sharp and do cut well...the first knife I used rusted after one use!! If you dont wash and dry these knives off directly after using them you probably wont have them long. Overall I would not recommend buying these.
3,Could Be Sharper,"These could be sharper, but for the price it's okay. These knives will still get the job done, personally I really like using the scissors. I use it a lot to cut up hot dogs since it's faster than using a knife for me.Also, in less than a month they are already starting to get rust spots on them from where they get wet. So try your hardest to keep them dry!"
2,Not sure what happened to the quality ...,I bought a set of these knives for myself but they were in the Black and I love them. So I ordered a set for my sister for her birthday and she told me the knives barely cut anything ... I am so disappointed.
2,You get what you pay for,These were cheap so I suppose that I can not complain to much and I should lower my standards slightly. The just feel like they are cheaply made and not very sharp. It's next to impossible to sharpen these properly too. I did like the scissors a lot out of the set though. They've held up nicely so far.
4,"Good, solid knives",These knives are very good. The block is compact and attractive...a good addition to the countertop. The knives work very well and are very sharp.
3,"Listen to reviews, after 8 months they rust.","These knifes were good for eight months, but they are starting to rust. I would recommend dishing out a bit more money for a higher quality set, unless your in a bind like us. Make sure you want knifes with blades displayed. We wanted something with a smooth flat blade, similar to a butcher knife for poultry cuts."
2,Sturdy... but Rusty,"These knives were very affordable and I decided to purchase them as a starter knife set. They are sturdy and cut well... but they rust almost immediately. I hand wash them and then let them air dry. Within the 2nd wash (some of the even the first!) they has little spots of rust on them. I also wish there were more blades that weren't serrated, but I didn't realize that at the time of purchase. Overall, I think you get what you pay for, they're pretty cheap knives. They cut well, but they rust quickly. Is rust bad for humans?"
1,Rusting already!,"I don't need anything too fancy which is why I bought these. However, it's totally unacceptable that they're rusting already. The knives also don't feel too sturdy when slicing...I'm going to see if I can return them."
1,Very Disappointed,Purchased item and received quickly from Amazon. Unpacked the knife set and recycled the packaging material. Hand washed all the knifes and placed them in the block. Pulled out one the next day a noticed rust on the knife already. Checked some others and found the same problem. Needless to say disappointed.Have purchased many items from Amazon over the years and this is the first item I have ever had a problem where I wanted to return the item. Returned to Amazon for a refund today.
4,Great Value,"These knives are very sharp and I am happy I purchased them. I shopped around and this was the best price. Although the block is natural in the photo, I received a black one. Decided not to bother with a return, but just know you might not get what is pictured. The knives are the same, just the block is black."
5,A happy daughter,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter who needed a good knife set for her home. She is very happy with it.
3,ginsu knives,"These knives are inexpensive and do the job.. however, important to wash asap by hand and DRY... noticed rust spots even if left in the sink for a short time"
5,GREAT!! GREAT!! GREAT!!,These Knifes for the PRICE are GREAT we have a set and LOVE them we Purchased both or parents a set and they got our sibling a set because they are so GREAT! I give them as wedding shower gifts EVERYONE needs a sharp KNIFE and they are worth so much more!! I warn you these knifes will make you think your food is way tender then it is (like cutting butter)!!!
3,"Fine, but flimsy","I read a review that raved about this knife set against other popular name brands, so maybe my expectations where too high. The knives are razor sharp and work well. I wish they weren't so flimsy thin and light, but I think the very low price reflects this so I really can't complain. The wooden block is very nice and looks good on display."
5,Love this set!,"Purchased this for a new apartment. Perfect; tons of steak knives and the two larger chef's knives are great for prepping ingredients. Very high quality for its price, and the block is small and takes up very little counter space in a very tiny kitchen in the city."
5,Finally a great set of knives,"Love, Love, Love, Love these knives!!! I've had several knife sets over my life and all were just ok. Some were semi-expensive (at least to my budget) and some where cheap but all were about the same quality.I got the Ginsu in a lightening deal and I will never buy another brand again. These knives ROCK! I've seen the silly commercials on TV for the Ginsu where they cut through really tough things then turn around and it still slices perfectly through a tomato. No, I haven't tried the aluminum cans like they used on TV. However, everything I have sliced, diced or chopped has been wonderful.This may be a coincidence but I've also have had a lot less problems with onions. Not sure why but they burn my eyes a lot less when I chop them with these knives. Maybe because the knives are so sharp I can get the onions cut up before my eyes get irritated....hmmm???"
3,OK for the price,"For $30 I didn't expect high quality. They are sharp, reasonably attractive, and do the job for the casual cook. I don't expect them to hold up well, but then for $30 shipped, I can't really complain. If they last a year or two I'll be pleasantly surprised."
2,Cheap but Not Great,"Initial impression is that the knives are light and doesn't contour well to the hand. Knives need to be well weighted and balanced to give the user a better feel. But I bought it on amazon for $26, and it is a choice for young home starters or learning cooking."
4,Good product for the money,"A good, solid set of knives. All the knives except the santoku are serrated, which makes them somewhat less precise than straight knives, but also means no sharpening. While not perfect, they feel comfortable in the hand and cut straight and cleanly. I would buy again, for myself or another busy household cook"
3,Did I order the right set?,I recieved the shippment fast.The package of knives were not as shown.I have a fat knife instead of two skinny long knifes.The surrading on the knives works great.Unsure how to sharpen them since they are surraded.We will see how they hold up in the long run.Great set for the right price!:)
1,not customer friendly!,I purchased this item for my sister for a christmas present and i was so embrassed when she opened it in front of me and what was supposed to be a 14 piece knife set was only a 13 peice! I contacted todays concept to request them to send me the knife she was missing and they refused and wanted me to take her present and ship the whole thing back to them! What a joke!!! Why would we want to pay to ship the whole set back when she is only missing ONE knife. This company needs better customer service skills!
1,Rusted on first washing,"The title pretty much says it all. Used once and they rust coming out of the dishwasher. Seemed sharp enough when using them, but you can't give them to guests to use with rust spots on the blades"
1,Knife missing,The quality of these knives is about average. There are supposed to be 13 knives in the set. My set contained only 12. Am I going to return it? What a hassle that would be for one more knife. Do yourself a favor and order a different set.
1,Missing Knife,"When i received the knife, I didn't open until xmas. I was missing 3 knife and after one month , 3 knife did not cut as promise. It was a gift to a family member, so I was pretty upset."
1,DIDN'T USE THEM YET,"DIDN'T USE THEM AS OF NOW. WILL LET YOU KNOW. PLANNING ON JUST FILLING AN INFORMMERCIAL DREAM. YOU KNOW. I WANT TO SLICE BEER CANS, CUT WOOD AND THEN SLICE A TOMATO. KIND OF A NOVELTY GIFT. A GIFT THAT I'LL KEEP FOR MYSELF. AND IF YOU ORDER NOW! I'LL THROW IN THE BLAH, BLAH, FOR ONLY 19.95 PLUS SHIPPING AND HANDLING. SHAM W W!"
1,Yuck!,Hated this product so much I returned it the next day. Ugly to look at; an eyesore in the kitchen.
3,"Great cut, poor quality steel",These knives seemed like a great buy until we washed them. First wash and they had rust spots bad. So hand wash and dry because its not stainless steel.Price for quality is pretty good of you hand wash and dry otherwise its pretty awful.
2,"Okay, but there are way better options out there..","All these are serrated knives except the longer thicker one. Was expecting more of a variety with how many pieces there are. Came with 3 more steak knives then they had proper slots for and they replaced other knives that were missing in the set. The scissors cut better than most I've had. The knives will def. rust if you put them in the dishwasher, so I would recommend hand-washing only. Flimsy and have a lighter, cheap feel to them, what do you expect for a lower priced set. They cut very nicely now, but I don't expect them to last very much longer. Bought because a friend recommended them, but will not buy again. Gave the knife set to them since they seemed to like the brand so much and they took back their recommendation... This set is okay if your looking for a some serrated knives that will last you maybe a year with minimal use."
2,Cuts great! but not true Stainless,"Bought these knives just over a month and 1/2 ago. They cut great and are still sharp, but, they're beginning to rust already. Stainless Steel isn't supposed to rust.... Take extra care of these if you buy them..."
1,Very Disappointed,"Was very excited about this purchase as our old knife set was in sad shape. Could not believe that after the first time of washing and letting dry on their own that their was rust on the blades. Tried to get it off and was unsuccessful, am returning the set."
1,Rusted in 20days!!!,"They served their purpose the first couple of days, but these knives rusted in under 20days. After washing them a few times, they have started rusting! There is no way I would use these knives to cut anything anymore, in fear rust may get into the food i cut."
3,Great set...except for the shears.,"I like almost everything about this knife set. They're both durable and attractive. That is, until you get to the shears. I have owned this set for less than a year and they have already come apart. I believe this is because the metal connecting the two halves rusted because of washing."
2,Doesn't Cut It,"I was looking for a good inexpensive replacement for my old knife set (inexpensive Tramonitna knife set, 10 years old). The Ginsu's got good ratings, so I thought I would give them a try.I cannot vouch for the Ginshu's. They seemed to be solidly made but I found my old knives cut much better than the brand new Ginsu's. So the new set is not worth it even though they were inexpensive. Not sure how they got the high ratings.On another note, I also found an interesting design problem with the wood block. This probably applies to a number of different knife sets, that might be of concern when you are shopping. The problem is that the slant of the block is not very great. This produced an interesting problem in that it was awkward to pull out a knife from the block when the block was under the kitchen cabinets. The cabinets got in the way blocking removing the knife. So I learned to appreciate a good block angle which this set did not have. My old wood block does not have this problem."
5,Put your dull designer knives in the drawer,"Just got my Ginsu knife set and I'm still looking for things to slice. After years of going through the latest, overpriced, fashionable knife, it's nice to get back to a knife that does exactly what it was designed to do at an EXTREMELY reasonable price. I could have purchased the set with stainless steel handles but there's something warm and comforting about the feel of bakelite. I think anyone over 40 would agree."
1,Rust spots on first use,"I received these after waiting several weeks because they were on back order. When they arrived, I was thrilled with the block and the look of the knives. I used them to cook and washed them. Upon putting them back in the block, I noticed that several of the knives had rust spots on them. These knives are supposed to be stainless steel; however, they shouldn't be rusting. I am very sad about this and hope it was simply a bad batch of the knives. Just be aware of this issue before you purchase this set of knives."
1,RUSTED IN 3 DAYS!,"I purchased the set based on the reviews in Amazon. Well, the knive had rust spots on each knive after only owning them for three days. I do not recommend investing in it. Don't do it."
3,Good for the first couple months.,This knife set dulls very quickly w/in 2-3 months. We bought 2 sets when they were super cheap and can notice a huge difference between the first set that is 9 months old and the new one.
2,Pay for What you Get,"Pros: Price. Sharp blades.Cons: Lightweight (feel cheap). Poorly constructed handles - 2 knives arrived with cracked handles and a third cracked after the first use.Yes, Amazon has a great return policy, but for a $25 purchase I don't want to deal with the hassle. With a brand name like Ginsu I expect to receive a quality product the first time.Ginsu also has a warranty on the knives, but at $3/knife for the return service it hardly seems worth it."
3,a worry-free option,"I've had mine for a little over a year now. They were very sharp when new, but actually did start getting dull recently. The santoku is the worst of the bunch. Flimsy and with a traditional blade, it got dull after just a few uses. The shears cracked and fell apart last month. The steak knives are still great for that purpose. And I managed to find a cheap infomercial sharpener that restored a little life to the rest of the blades.I guess all in all, that's a pretty negative review. But considering the price, I'm very satisfied. I never wanted the stress and expense of having to take care of a truly good set of knives. I'd buy these again without hesitation."
3,"Okay, with some flaws.","VERY VERY SHARP. The slightest touch will cut skin. Does a good job of cutting, but not on the big jobs. They also get dark water stains on them that will not come off. Like them for dinner time and smaller vegetables, but don't like them for cutting raw meat or large vegetables."
1,You get what you pay for!,"I purchased this set for my wife for Christmas. Knowing that Ginsu is suppose to be one of the best cutlery sets you can buy for a decent price. They are suppose to never need sharpening and to be honest they are indeed very sharp. The knife block is nice and looks great up on the counter in the kitchen and there is a knife for most occasions. The issue is that they rust. We have only had the set out for about 3 weeks and already the blades are rusting. We use them and immediate hand wash and dry our dishes thoroughly. There is no reason to have rust appearing on the blades in my opinion. So if you want a cheap set that will get the job done, you should get these, however be ready to deal with rusting issues a month after you purchase them! I am very displeased in the product simply for this reason."
4,Great for the price I paid,I have to hand wash these knives because they rust if you put them in the dishwasher. But other than that they are pretty good.
3,You get what you pay for,"I read a lot of reviews before buying these knives. Many said that they would rust, and they do. In fact, one of the knives rusted after the first time through the dishwasher. However, I read that even expensive stainless knives often rust a little, and that any knives should be taken care of if you expect them to last. They can be cleaned by using Comet or Bartender's best friend, and they clean up pretty good.But the knives themselves work fine, almost all of them are serrated, but easy to use. They work very well for cutting fruits and vegitables. The main reason we bought this set was that it also comes with a complete set of steak knives. For the price, you can't beat it, just know going in that there is some upkeep with these knives."
2,loose handles,I got these for my inlaws since their old knifes were non existent. I gave them as an xmas gift. 3 weeks later I stopped over and grabbed a hold of one and the handle was loose. Not what I was expecting after all the good reviews I saw. Beware of quality.
2,Cheap and rusty,"Despite other user reviews, they rust if machine-washed (which I did). The overall look of this set is not impressive."
4,"for the price, great product.",i would buy this again. very sharp and still using it with no dulling. purchased for vacation home and would recommend.
2,Flimsy and disappointing,"I was pretty excited to get these, the reviews were strong and it was very affordable... but I should have known I'd just get what I paid for. They're sharp, but they feel so flimsy in your hand...I was cutting a red onion and could not get a straight line, it sort of wiggled around and instead of slicing right through, if that makes sense. I regret this purchase. Seems like people who give these a good review have probably never used a good knife before."
4,Good for money,"Bought this for my wife. Very sharp (as she found out), however specks of rust did start appearing after first wash. For the money, this is a wonderful set of knives."
1,awful set!,"I bought this knives as as start set. Of the set, there is one knife that works well. They are very light which results in needing to use a lot of force when trying to cut with them. Im VERY unhappy with these knives. :("
3,Nice set for the price,"It is a nice knife set for the price, but if you are going to buy Ginzu for namesake then I would advise paying more money for a better set."
2,"Functional, but save your money for something nicer.","The knives are of a decent weight, but the blades rust easily and dull easily. Be prepared to wash your knives right away after using them, because leaving them in water for longer than five minutes---no exaggeration---will leave rust spots on the knives."
4,Not too shabby,For the price this knife set is perfect. There is better quality out there but the price can not be beat. I recomend these for a small family kitchen. I cook almost every night and these knifes are still sharp and washing well.
3,Cheap,"You get what you pay for, as soon as it has been washed it needs to be dried or you will get rust spots.The handle will brake if the knife is dropped"
3,Good Knife Set for the Price,"I purchased this knife set after reading several reviews that the knifes are extremely sharp. In my opinion, the knife are adequately sharp (esp. for the price $30), but not quite as sharp as implied by some of the reviews. There are more expensive knife set out there in the $80+ range that are significantly sharper than this knife set; however..again, for the price you can't beat it! Overall, I'm satisfied w/ the set."
4,Good Deal,"Purchased these for my college age son; setting up a second household is not inexpensive and this set offers a bit of everything plus a knife block. For safety a full tang is important, it provides strength and longevity, nothing worse than having a tang pull loose from the handle when you cutting. Time and experience have shown that Ginsu blades do last a long time and sharpening is not required. I anticipate this set shall last well through his twenties. Price is more than completive and with super saver shipping you can`t find a better deal..."
3,They're good,"They are not wonderful. But they are light, sharp and plentiful. Still waiting to see how long it takes from them to dull."
3,Good for the price,"Good for the price, only bad thing, I have to hand wash them. They get rusty if washed in the dishwasher."
1,:(,"Awesome variety, Cut great, very sharp!!! butttt...One month and almost every knife has rust, so ill be trashing them to buy a more expensive set that wont rust. :( enough said"
4,Nice for the price,"Nice knives for the price. They cut well and are easy to grip. The only thing I don't like is that the black handles all dulled after a few washings. I have hand-washed them all and all have discolored. They are not that bad, but the shiny polished look is gone, replaced by a dull almost grey color. Besides that, I would recommend them."
3,OK for the money,As a young couple we really love to cook and have been upgrading our kitchen. I saw these and thought hey for the money its worth the risk.Meh.Nice set at first but after one wash in the machine they dull up and then become rather ugly. So I decided to only Hand-Wash the other knives but they also soon dulled.Another thing is that all the Knives are serrated except the Sontaku. It is really wierd to chop and dice vegetables with serrated knives. Maybe I'm just inexperienced in the kitchen but the serrated bottoms are not typical I believe.If your looking for new knives I'd look into a different set.
4,Ginsu Experience,"After a miserable year financially in 2007, I needed to get a Christmas gift for the wife/cook that did the job, but didn't break the bank. I took a chance and purchased these Ginsu knives after having to re-sharpen our existing cheapo set of knives countless times in 2007.So far, so good. The wife loves the new set of Ginsu knives, and the fact that they stay sharp (so far) and look nice in the black holder. Plus, I look like a hero, buying something nice for the wife that she can use, even though 2007 was a lean year for us.Thank you Ginsu!"
1,Do not bother,"This is the worst set I have ever purchased. The knives got here on the 3rd of December, its the 13th and now I start seeing rust spots. I definitely do not recommend this set."
5,Ginsu knives,"These are the sharpest knives I have ever owned. I have owned much more expensive knives, but I threw them out. I am now buying Ginsu knives for my kids and their families. It will be the only knife they will ever need. Carol Blacharski"
4,Good Value,"A solid set of knives for the price paid. Nothing fancy, but they get the job done and are sharp."
2,Simple package.,"I was kind of disappointed after I open the Amazon box. The knife package even does not have Ginsu logo on it, only plain paper box, not even includes an instruction of the usage for each knife. The knife is thinner than I expected, not easy to hold, I prefer the heavy and very quality feel of the other major brand. It is only a set of ok knife for the price you pay. You may get a better set in Ross, TJ about the same price."
3,Feels flimsy,For the price these knives are ok. But if you do heavy at home cooking like I do then I'd save my money and get better knives. They don't seem to retain their sharpness for too long and feel really really flimsy. The knives are flexible like a ruler. I just wouldn't be too cheap with knives because they are pretty much one of the most important things in a kitchen.
3,Good value for the money.,"After 3 years of use, I can conclude that these knives offer a good value for the money. The pros and cons listed here by other reviewers is adequate. They are good knives out of the box, and served me well for the past few years. But.. the blades don't make it easy to sharpen, and my knives rusted near the handles. I am getting rid of them now , and upgrading to a more pro line of knives: Wusthoff Classic knives. Obviously, there is a difference in spending $30 on a knife set and $400 on a knife set, but after watching these knives fade over the years, I would like to have a set that will last, and that can be easily maintained and honed."
4,Sharp,"Really sharp knives. Great for the price. Cutting meat, vegetables is smooth now! I do think the grip can be better. Also, I do not use dishwasher to clean them so no rust issues."
3,Cutting edge,Good product - yet the manufacturer could add more options than just grit saw like knives. Some knives need not be jagged edged.
2,Sharp,After the first wash they started to get rust on them! Not sure if they were not supposed to go into the dishwasher!
4,Solid product,These knives cut very well which I think is all you can ask for at the price point. They did rust on me in some spots but I have hard water where I live and I also do not handwash them so I don't believe it has anything to do with the make of the knife.
3,"Great Concept, Rusts in first day","Left a knife not completely wiped down and apparently the STAINLESS STEEL decides to RUST, and it has now done so in multiple areas. Had these only 5 days. Not going to send back because these are a throw away, could have saved the shipping cost at Bed Bath and Beyond and got a little cheaper too. They cut nice, look like they could be solid handles, but poor steel to rusts instantly."
1,Rust Problem After Only 6 Week's Use,"Years and years ago my father in law gave me a Ginsu knife. I loved it, I still use it. I gave my godson this knife set for Christmas. Imagine my horror when he called me 6 weeks later to say all the knives had begun to rust. A rusty knife is useless."
3,Average,"These knives were ok for the price. One came missing from the package, they rust kind of easily and do not cut very well."
5,Great Knives!,"These knives are really nice for the price. I had some Ginsu knives that were 11 years old and one of the blades was coming loose from the handle and the part on the scissors that covers the hinge came off and this set only had a total of 5 knives, (1 steak knife)not enough steak knives for us, so I thought I would get a new set with more steak knives. These are way better than the older set! Very nice for the price. Very sharp. So far, so good. I also put mine in the dishwasher and they seem fine so far. The old ones were put in the dishwasher too and they did fine. Also, the package has a insert that says dishwasher safe."
5,Excellent value,"For under thirty dollars, you cannot go wrong. The blades really live up to the cliche ""Sharp as a razor."" The wood block looks very nice too. Perfect cutlery set for the occasional cook in the house but I suspect the more frequent chiefs might prefer a heavier duty set."
2,Too lightweight,"Handles are cheesy plastic, much too lightweight. Not as sharp as some I've had in the past.Not recommended"
5,Sharp as ever,Very happy with knives. Use carefully as they are very sharp. Have only had them for a few months and no problems. Great deal.
3,worth the price,"Just moved into a new apartment, and wasn't looking to spend much money. I can't comment on how well the knives have held up, since we only just bought them a few weeks ago. However, they appear to be of good quality and definitely worth the price. If I have to replace them next year, they'll still have done their job.Fast forward to 9 months later:I'm changed my original review from 4 stars to 3 stars . . . just wanted to say that as the others who ranked the knives before me, they did totally rust. The product comes with a ""knife replacement guarantee"", but it costs $3 S&H; or something for each knife, so it's not worth it. The knives still cut, but they look cheap with rust marks on them. As I said in my original review, I do think they were worth their money, but nothing more. I got what I paid for."
3,It's good but the display was horrible.,"The knives themselves are fine. The block is of real wood and smells of read wood which I like. However, when I got package and I opened it...the knives weren't in a real box. It was a plain cardboard box with the block in bubble wrap and the knives in another plain cardboard box, wrapped in plastic. It's rather embarrassing giving that to someone for Christmas. Shipping was decent."
2,ginsu knife set,i havent had them long but they seem like an awesome set of knives especially for the price. they are very sharp and durable and very nice looking
1,Became Rusty in a week!,"I will not write much about this set, they are sharp really, but it will be useless if they become rusty in a week!They are not stainless! It is a lie!"
3,Five Guns West,"Good story of The War Between the States west of the Mississippi River. Casting and plot development could have been better. There was a CSA Ranger outfit that operated from northwestern Texas into eastern New Mexico and southern Colorado which could have carried out the mission a lot better than convicts. But its good to see a story, seldon seen, of the war this far west."
2,Doesn't cover settling a trust.,"I am in the process of settling a rather simple trust. However, I found this book of no use. Note the author first wrote a book titled ""A Living Trust"" which discussed setting up a living trust. ""Settle a Living Trust"" is a rehash of the ""A Living Trust"" with a little information about settling a trust. I wouldn't recommend buying this book if your seeking help in settling a trust."
1,How to Settle Your Living Trust:; How you can Settle a LIving Trust Swiftly,"I am amazed the author of this book had the nerve to write such a book. I used his company to settle my father's estate-it wasn't swiftOR easy-it was a NIGHTMARE- requiring 4 attorneys, three accountants and 3 years of constant legal work to clean up the mess that his company recreated. My father was middle class and trusted the advise he got from Mr. Abts- his advise ended costing us thousands in legal fees-, and 3 years of constant stress to get the mess he created cleaned up. When confronted - we found that not only was his advise bad but that he does not stand behind his advise or work! we had no legal recourse for his major mistakes as he is NOT an attorney!"
3,It's Okay...,"It's not really all that great. There are some okay pictures and there are a lot of facts, but sometimes it contadicts itself. It'll say one thing, then ten pages later it'll say totally the opposite. And since it's unofficial, who knows how much of what it's saying is true? From now on I'm only buying OFFICIAL *NSYNC books."
4,Great photos!,"This book has some really great photos collected from fans across the States.. they are close-up and clear (perfect for pin-ups!) They also have some in-depth profiles on all of the guys, which are pretty on-target. Most of the information big fans would know, but in general they're pretty good. I recommend this book for any younger fans wanting to know more about the group or any big fans that HAVE to have everything with *NSYNC in it :)"
4,"Unofficial, but still...","Okay, so it's not ""official."" We all know what happens when you buy unofficial merchandise.... Still, this is a pretty good book. If you have the extra cash, and you're a die-hard *NSYNCer like I am, I'd still recommend it. You don't even need to buy it for the words--buy it for the pictures! There's some really cute ones in it :) But in future, I'll probably opt more for Official stuff. It just feels sort of...shifty (or maybe it's cheap) buying ""fake"" stuff. Stay *NSYNC!"
2,Surprisingly incomplete,"First, understand that this is primarily a furniture book, not an architecture book. No real examples of window or door trim, crown molding, etc. As such, it's not really a companion to The Abrams Guide to American House Styles. I thought it would show the interior architecture that accompanied the exterior architecture characteristic of different periods, but no such luck.Second, while the book may be fun (for some) to browse, it shows itself to be surprisingly incomplete once you start to look for specific periods. What I was looking for was Greek Revival. A fairly prominent American style, and yet not even mentioned in the book.Overall a disappointment for someone who wanted to see what architects did on the inside to complement the outside of major American architectural styles."
5,A book that is hard to refuse!,"What mob figure is more famous than that of John Gotti? What was done to bring him down? How did the government finally manage to make the charges stick? Busting the Mob is a great insight into that very question.While this book covers organized crime connection into the teamster union as well as other major mob bosses, it was the Gotti case that had me gripping the book tightly with a wealth of facts, witnesses and testimony.Each case presented is in fact, well laid out, with actual trial testimony. There is actual court documents, investigation notes and so much more included. This book was well put together and an excellent read. What you read about the mob versus what is fact are usually two different things, this book may shock you in some cases, but it should open you eyes in all cases. Enjoyable and amazing and the price makes it hard for you to refuse!"
3,"Sustained release, but not Non-flushing","I have taken niacin for several years and always bought non-flushing. In an effort to save a few $$, I decided to try the sustained release, figuring it would be the same as non-flushing. I was wrong. I take the tablets every day and would say I get a flush maybe 1-2 times a week. The flush only lasts 10 min. or so, but it is a bit awkward to be talking to someone and feel your face getting beat red ! Not sure why sometime and not others, but figure it mustbe what I have eaten just prior to taking the tablet. Seems to work well, but unless you want to risk a flush, you may want to consider flush-free."
3,Not Great,"Not sure this stuff is true to size. 3/8"" doesn't fit 3/8"" fittings so great. I bought 3 different sizes for the oil and fuel lines on my bike and none of it fit right. Maybe if I'd used the Spectre hose ends but I didn't like them. Good price though and I got it quickly."
4,"""Raw"", stiff leather, but begins to stretch within first 24hrs.","Taking price into account, I'd bump it up to 4.5 stars. If you want a minimal solution for holding some cards, and maybe a few bills of cash, this will work fine. Perhaps it would be optimal when combined with a separate money clip for larger quantities of bills (you can always try it out first ""as-is"" and add a money clip later if you need it). At first, the card slots will likely seem to be too tight, but they'll start to stretch/form within the first 24hrs of card insertion. I rubbed some jojoba oil into mine to give it a darker, more conditioned appearance (Note: I'm not sure if this is the best oil or treatment to use; you should research it yourself). It looks nice. I'm still not sure if it will be workable for me, without an additional money clip. I'm waiting to see how flexible it becomes -- If it does become a total solution on it's own, I'd make it 5 stars."
5,Exactly What I Was Looking For,"I was looking for a thin but sturdy card holder that would fit in my front pocket without being bulky or uncomfortable....and I found it with this card holder wallet. It is about the thinnest I have found, the leather is nice and soft and, in the month or so that I have had it, the wallet has molded nicely to the cards that I have in it. I am completely satisfied and would definitely recommend the wallet."
5,nice little pickup!,bought this for the girl for when we go out. she doesn't like hauling her purse around but always is breaking cards and id's keeping them in her pocket. so now she stuffs them in here and problem solved. takes it everywhere with her. would highly recommend.
2,Terrible quality,"1. Not sure if it is actually a leather, and even is, it has a terrible quality.2. This thing is filled with a paper between ""leather"" layers.3. Glue is all over the place4. It has some white weird circle dirt on top5. It just feels bad, I don't even want to hold it with my handsThe maximum price for this ""leather"" card holder is about 1 dollarIn summary this thing is going right to the trash bag."
4,It's exactly what I wanted.,"I was given one of these several years ago and wore it out. I've been looking for one for awhile and finally found it. I don't like to carry a big wallet, this is perfect."
2,You get what you pay for,"Try the same product from saddleback leather company. Sure it's $29, but it'll be the last one you ever buy."
2,the good the bad the ugly,"good- the size is perfect. Bad- the stitches came out after three weeks of light use. Ugly- well it's not ugly, smells good, for tem bucks I am satisfied but not impressed"
5,my butt is happy,"For years I've always carried a wallet with loads of useless stuff and it made me sit like the leaning tower. I got this credit card holder because nowadays I never carry cash so it should work perfect. So far it has, and my butt is happy that it no longer leans to one side and each tush has equal amount of pressure on it. :)I was able to fit 6 cards, driver's license, SSI card, AAA card, and two other things in it."
4,Overall I'm Happy,"I purchased this wallet to replace a similar one I bought many years ago. The leather is great (I went with brown). However, it's a bit short such that your money sticks out of the top (money is slightly more than 2.75"" high and the wallet is stitched at the bottom so the compartment is probably 2.6"" high or so."
4,Nice,"This is a nice item, especially for the price. On the downside, the ""marshal genuine leather"" text is a little too noticeable for me, and the whole thing is a little stiff - good luck fitting any more than 4 bills in the wallet part."
3,For the ABSOLUTE Minimalist,"Honestly, these wallets are on par with the stuff you find at the 99cent store.I ordered a black one and a brown one.The first one fell apart in a matter of weeks, but the second one is still strong at 3 months.The thing with this wallet is that you can't expect to carry much in it.I would highly recommend it for anyone who carries nothing more than 3 cards/licenses.Once you use all four sleeves and pack more than 3 bills in the center pocket, you stress the wallet.If you hardly carry anything, this is for you.If you generally like to have cash on hand, I'd keep an alternate wallet on standby."
5,"Great, sleek wallet","My number one goal was to find a thin wallet for a few credit cards, my ID, and a couple bucks in cash. Found it. Love it."
4,Functional but bad quality,"I bought one of these for my partner. He didn't want to carry his thick wallet anymore. It proved to be very useful, so I got him another one in a different color. The second one that came had a different logo stamped on the wallet (not sure why) that was much larger. I would not have liked this, but as a woman, it isn't exactly what I would look for either way. The problem that I see is that when he removes his card there is often fabric that moves in and out. One of the outside pockets has also come unglued (that's right unglued, not unstitched) so that the underside of the fabric is exposed. The wallets are not made well, but he doesn't care. Other buyers may be put off by the quality. Keep in mind they're very inexpensive, so quality isn't entirely expected. The two colors that I bought for him were darker brown and black.Important points: not intended for women, possible variation in quality and appearance, but extremely useful and inexpensive"
5,Slim and stylish,"I ordered this credit card holder because I hated having a big clunky wallet in my pocket and most of the time I only needed to take cards out with me on my travels.It's very thin and has 4 places for your cards.I love this thing, it comes with me everywhere I go."
5,JUST AWESOME!!!!,"It was exactly what I wanted as I do not even know that it is in my pocket, yet it has my ID, CC and cash! Great product and really helps out with the lower back!! Thank you!!"
4,"Slim, but room for slimmer","This may sound like an odd remark, but I thought this wallet was one-sided. It's actually two-sided allowing for 4 card slots and a middle pocket. Since I was planning to use this for my transit cards, I wanted the slimmest possible profile, and thus the search goes on. But it's still pretty darn thin. Also, it's a little longer than a credit card -- they could trim a few millimeters methinks. Ok, now I'm being persnickety."
3,average,"It got rid of small bumps, but in trickier areas it didn't do much. It doesn't burn at all, though.If you need something to get rid of all bumps fast, spend a little more money on a better product."
1,Not so effective,"My main concern on receiving this order was that it was smaller than I thought and for that price.... but then, I thought..as long as I see results, I wouldn't mind ordering a second bottle. I didn't notice much change after using it as directed for almost a month now and I don't think I would be finishing this bottle either as I have noticed a rash, sort of like skin peeling off in the area I've been using it for over a week now. This rash is also itchy and hurts when scratched. I've stopped using the cream and the rash seems to be disappearing. I think I'll just throw away what's left in the bottle.........not impressed by this product, I was really hoping it'd clear my shaving bumps but I guess I have to keep looking hopefully, there's a better product out there. I only gave this a star because it actually seemed like it was working in the beginning before the onset of the rash."
2,maybe a little bit outdated...,"The book gives a solid base on the different principles of converters and inverters. But I also expected to see ICs included as they were already available back in 1993! A chapter on the influence of different core materials and their calculation is, in my eyes, missing for this book to be a complete reference."
1,A useless book,"Book just skims the topics mentioned in its title - just a disordered collection of a bit outdated drawings with childlike commentary. No word about power conversion essentials: topologies, magnetics, feedback, stability, EMI, power semiconductors."
3,It's more like a reference book.,This book presents different circuit configurations and tries to explain what they do theoretically. Definitely not for beginners in electronics. It does not give you an introduction to many things you should know to be able to understand what is explained here. It is good as a reference book.
4,The plan reduces the number of samples required.,"The book offers a well-reasoned, easy to understand statistical approach to sampling which reduces the number of samples required while maintaining high quality standards. The plan specified in the book is equivalent to MILSPEC plans, and saves time and money."
2,Parents as Partners in Education,This textbook is very disjointed to read. I have found it not to be pertinent as to what the title suggests.
2,needed this for a class,"I bought this book for a class and thought it would be one that would be relevant to my work with parents. There is only so much that can be said and then there is repetition or information that is far from necessary. I was assigned chapter 10, ""working with parents of children with disabilities"". Of the 42 pages 26 talked about the history and laws of special education. There was not really anything useful in the chapter that gave specific advise on working with parents. Some of the other chapters were child abuse and home schooling. Not at all what I expected."
1,"Very, very disappointing for Prima","My husband and I (yes, we are grown-ups) have been using strategy guides in the Zelda series for many years. This one is, by far, the worst of the bunch. Those of us who buy strategy guides want (and often, need) a walk-through that actually walks you through what to do and/or how to do it. This one seems to think that some screen shots 1 inch x 1 inch will suffice. The sidequests are very poorly described, and the order in which to pursue the sidequests is not apparent. My husband says it reads like stereo instructions. I will try the other official strategy guide and maybe it will be better."
3,"Great Guide, One MAJOR problem...","I'll agree with everyone at this is a fantastic, through guide. Everything you need to know is easy to find, and you can learn EVERYTHING about the game... and there in is the problem. The Prima Guide not only serves as a walk through but GIVES AWAY all the story and the ending!!! What's the point of even playing the game when you already know the WHOLE story and outcome? Prima's been publishing for YEARS, they SHOULD know better.If you don't care about spoilers, get this guide. If you want to play the game through and be able to progress though the story w/o having it ruined for you, look else where."
2,"Wind Waker Guide Good, Ocarin Guide BAD!","Okay Wind Waker is a fun game and doesn't really need a guide so I got this for the Ocarine of Time guide because being the best Zelda game ever Ocarina can stil make you want to pull your hair out sometimes. The guide for Ocarina have [bad] maps and doesn't give you any info on how to find heart pieces or anything it's just a waist of 12 pages, yup it's that small 12 pages. Don't waste the money if you want Ocarina hints, and if you don't mind story spoilers for Wind Waker then go for it."
5,The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker (Prima's Official Strategy Guide),"what can I say, it has everything I need to know and more. Its Good."
5,Barb Donovan,Barb Donovan is one of those rare talented artists who does not allow overproduction to overwhelm the simple beauty of her songs. This CD is highly recommended.
2,Not a worthwhile book at all....,"I really hoped that this book was some kind of visionary look at what actually happened to the American Indians, but it is not that!Mostly it's just bad writing and a rather obvious con-job, and that makes me really sad, because what the American Indian has endured, is much more than this..the metaphors that are needed to really understand what happened to native humans in this country, are NOT in this book..."
1,New book looks used,"I purchased this new, and expected it to be sealed. Not only was it not sealed, but a couple of pages were folded. I would have returned this item. However, I bought this as a gift and was on a timeline. I also purchased a new CD which came in a busted case. I have always trusted Amazon, and been very satisfied in the past.Very disappointed."
4,"Yarona, Abdullah Ibrahim","According to my opinion, there is a better example of those Abdullah trios, the ""African Magic"".However, ""Yarona"", remains a very good example of the recent Abdullah work with trios and one of the advantages is the presence of Marcus McLaurine, the bassist, whose work -once more- is beautiful: creative, innovative, sensitive.For whom they love Abdullah work, it still remains a record to listen to."
3,Just as good as the dormie slipper...but,"I have worn Daniel green slippers for over 15 years. My mother began buying them for me because they are a well made, high quality, leather house slipper that lasts a long time. Also I have a flat foot and my arch would fall a lot so I needed a slipper with a slight heel on it - as I was coming up - so this was it.I usually get the Dormie style, but since this was on sale I decided to give this a try as I needed a new pair. I wear a narrow and this fits perfectly. Same good quality as the dormie, but the knot at the top can be a bit irritating to the top of the foot.This shoe needs to be ""broken in"" / stretched in order for the underside of the knot not to rub your foot."
1,twice bitten,"This microwave died at about three months in my possession. The authorized service dealer which I finally found in my yellow pages (not able to find this dealer from Panasonic) finally fixed it after about two months. I've now operated it for five months and it's died again. Still under warranty, I plan to take it back for further servicing. It'll probably go out again based on it's track record but with my luck this will be when it's out of warranty. Beware of this micro."
1,Looks good - but doesn't last,"I purchased the predecessor to this model last April because it looked great and had lots of functional bells and whistles. I didn't use it until June because I was re-modelling until then.When it came out of the box - it still looked great and some of the advance functions were cool.But.... the defrost setting didn't, and the reheat sensor tended to produce super-heated food. This microwave would regularly trip the fuse on my newly rewired kitchen outlets. It worked OK most of the time.Until it didn't....Literally less than a week out of warranty (which starts the day you order the product NOT the day you receive it) the machine totally died. The local Pansonic agent estimated it would cost at least $100 to fix and Panasonic Customer Service was no help at all, even though I'd had less than 10 months use of the appliance.So if you want a good looking, disposable microwave - this is the one for you!!"
4,"Great workout, not for people who are new to the FIRM","This workout is extremely fast paced, because the instructor, Emily, is squeezing in a total-body workout in just 30 minutes. I didn't mind the fast pace, though-it made me want to return to the workout again and again for a few days so I could master each move. Once you've mastered each move, it's a lot of fun!There's not a lot of ""hand-holding"" in this workout. The cues are fast and Emily is so out of breath at times that she's a little hard to understand. Before trying this workout, I definitely recommend becoming familiar with the FIRM first. 2 great starter DVDs are Cardio Overdrive and Hard Core Fusion."
3,Good- but not my favorite,"I love The Firm workouts. This one is good, and will be better when I learn the moves. The warm-up and the music don't go well together and Emily doesn't give a lot of prompting when going onto a new move but her energy and enthusiasm are fun. Once I have the moves down, this will be a lot of fun and will get me sweating. I don't recommend this to first timers, but once you get used to The Firms moves (I recommend Allison's workouts in the beginning) this one is a good, quick workout that hits all areas of the body."
2,Need some serious practice to master this DVD,"No, this workout DVD isn't hard but you may want to sit down and watch it a few times before trying it. Guarantee if you're not one to pick up on the movements right away, your first workout will be frustrating and full of pauses thus not much of workout. I find it highly insulting that some reviewers would cut down others who find this workout to be too fast. Yeah, it IS too fast and I believe a really good workout DVD will have an instructor who can lead you through from start to finish, sweaty and feeling accomplished. The first few workouts on this DVD may make someone feel like giving up right away and extremely frustrated. So all in all, good workout, not so great instructor. Just my thoughts and opinions."
1,NO CUES AT ALl,This would be a great workout if the instructor gave you any cues at all to the moves. You CANNOT just pop this dvd in and start working out.. Its a little ridiculous in that aspect.
2,not a great one,"really like firm videos, and usually like this instructor, but hated this dvd....similar to other reviewers"
4,You cannot just JUMP into the firm,"The Firm builds on one another. You have to know what the firm is about because you will understand that they have a basic set of steps with a new twist in every DVD. So for folks saying they tried this one and hated it - well I would too if I jumped into the firm.Don't start with one random video like this - use a SYSTEM. i.e. BSS 1, 2, 3,4 or transformation to introduce yourself to the firm.Emily is hardcore and she doesn't mess around. This DVD also assumes that you've been with us for a while. So for someone who has all the systems and been firming FOREVER, yea, the cueing to music rhythm is off and that sucks. But ignore it and focus on what she's saying. By the third time in you should have this workout and be sweating buckets."
2,Not for the coordination challenged,"I stopped this tape after seven minutes because I could not follow the moves. I am just not able to learn that many different moves in milliseconds. I think it is probably a good workout, but it is difficult for those of us who are not fast learners."
2,Didn't like it!!!,I did not like this video. Emily's cueing was awful. She tried to do to much at one time and it was impossible to keep up with her. I have been doing the firm for years and this was a total waste of money for me. Don't waste your time or money on this video.
2,how much coffee has this girl had?,"Even though I have been a Firm devotee for years, I had trouble with this DVD. Emily is way hyper here,lacks rythmn and gives virtually no cueing. There is no flow to the movement. I had to laugh at one particularly frustrating moment because one of the other excerciser/ instructors was looking at her in a way that totally echoed my feelings- like 'Girl, what the h*ll are you doing?'.I really don't have much positive to say except that it is only 30 minutes long."
1,The Firm Power Half Hour,"We were very disappointing with this video, we do a wide variety of work outs, Denise, Billy, Mina, Cathe,... and more, and yet we never have found the cues as bad as this one, and not only are the cues almost non existent, the camera shifts to a close up when you should be seeing an overall body shot. it seems Emily is more concerned with the routine than the actual work out. Should this video have come with a set of pom poms? We might try it again but are afraid that it may be doomed to be donated to someone with more patience. I would give this video a Turkey"
2,What's Up!!,"This video was ok, however I found myself rewinding because Emily moved from one move to the next so quickly you did not have time to catch it. Slow down!! After doing it a couple of times I'm sure I will be ok because I will know what is coming next."
2,Too complicated,"I have around 30 firm DVDs, and usually love Emily Welsh. The choreography in this one is by far the most complicated of any Firm DVD I have ever done. Everything moves very quickly, and I found a lot of the moves awkward-- many just didn't seem to naturally flow together, and/or involved too many directional changes. Personally, it would take me more than a couple times through to catch on, if I ever did. This one will be going on the shelf for awhile."
2,"No cues, No explanations","I bought this in order to change up my regular workout dvds. I've never tried anything by The Firm and was wanting to give it a try. I'm sure this dvd is great for people who have been in The Firm program. However, for newbies like me, I was at a total loss. In the beginning it was okay, but as the workout progressed I could not keep up. I kept having to stop the dvd and rewind so I could try to figure out what the instructor was doing. I eventually gave up in frustration. I'm sure this may be great for people who have been in the program and know the moves but it's not a pick for an outsider like me."
1,Ridiculous!,"I purchased this in a store on a whim and I wish I had resisted the impulse and checked the reviews here first. But it said ""beginner modifications, anyone can do it"" so I took a chance. I'm sorry I wasted my money! This workout might be great if you are 20 years old, but if you are 46 with 30 pounds to lose, this is NOT for you. They go WAY too fast, cueing happens at the exact second she does the move and she only does it a couple of times before adding more to something you don't even have down yet. It's insane. The camera hops around from girl to girl at an equally breakneck speed, so you can't even watch any of them doing the moves all the way thru. Anyone not already in top shape is going to get hurt trying to follow this."
4,Not for Beginners!!!,"I recently fell OFF the workout wagon and am starting again. I have several FIRM tapes and bought this to get my self in shape before using my other FIRM 30 min tapes - BIG mistake!!! Don't get me wrong, this is a good workout - but, was much to intense for me in my current shape... I defn need to work upto including this as part of my workout routine....but, if you are someone who is in shape and are looking for a challenging workout - give this a try......"
5,Great workout in a short time,"I love this workout DVD! I bought it for my mom first, because she, too, loves The Firm tapes, and she let me borrow it. I love that I can get a good workout in 30 minutes. It gets your heartrate up and you feel good afterwards. Some of the cardio was a little tricky to learn the first time because she moves through it real quick and doesn't give much time to practice(and I am an advanced user), but once you do it a few times, you will get it and then it's fun.Highly recommend!"
2,"ok, but could be better","I like very much Emily as a Firm instructor, but this DVD is not what I expected from her. The instructor usually cues very well, but in this one she goes so fast it's almost impossible to follow. I know its only 30 minutes but that should not interfere with her cueing. The first strengh segment for me was the worst(the part of the squat then turn then lat rows) in one point she even kind of laugh, I guess she knows its too fast. I had done the DVD more than 5 times, since I want to give it a chance and still find it a bit off. I have more than 35+ Firm DVD's and find this one just ok. I should had rent it first instead of buying right away."
4,A good 1/2 hour workout,"After reviewing many of the comments and decided the negatives weren't bad enough to prevent me from purchasing this exercise video. I am very glad that I did. I love it, its a great workout video, all areas are worked and I was able to see results qucikly.While it is fast moving and only minimal warning/instruction is given, you have to keep in mind this is only a 30 minute workout. If more time was given to instruction it would defeat the purpose of a quick workout. If you're already a firm user, you won't have any trouble following the instructor and you won't be disappointed.The price was great also, as The Firm was offering it at almost $10 more."
5,Eddie Elephant,This is a classic and very old book in great condition. I remember it from when my grandmother told me the story when I was a little girl and could never find it until now.
1,very disapointing!!,not much more then a toy...very small....runs only on battries and they lasy only 45 mins or less!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING AT ALL..
1,Stopped Working,This camera has a very short battery life. The picture quality is not great. The main problem is that it just stopped working. It will no longer turn on even thought there are new batteries installed. I do not recommend buying.
3,Turnabout Intruder - a horrible episode superbly acted.,"It is obvious that Turnabout Intruder was meant to be a slap in the face of the NBC suits who tried to kill Star Trek. The plot and story were cliche in the extreme; I can't imagine Gene Roddenberry signing off on something like this if he wasn't completely offended by the way NBC treated him and his creation. That being said, anyone who says William Shatner cannot act should screen this episode. One could tell that there was considerable effort expended in getting the acting job ""just right."" This wasn't just any ""contractual obligation"" job; this was art.As for the pilot, I always thought the tone was a lot closer to Star Trek - The Next Generation. The bridge was a lot quieter than it usually was in the original series, and the acting was far less ""over the top."" With a little more work, and a lot more money, this could easily have been done to cinematic standards. One can easily imagine a remake directed by Stephen Spielberg."
4,Not too bad,"I only give this one four stars because the final episode--""Turnabout Intruder""--was pretty lame. Bad way to end the series. The inclusion of two versions of ""The Cage"" makes the DVD worthwhile, however, along with Gene Roddenberry's little featurette. One point of contention with Jared's review: ""The Cage"" has, in fact, aired during reruns. While I still have my ""all-colour collector's edition"" VHS copy, it was played at least once on the Sci-Fi Channel, back when Sci-Fi ran sort of a 23rd-century two-hour program block (Star Trek the first hour, and Babylon 5 the second, which is when I actually got into J. Michael Straczynski's television gem).I only watched the the B&W/Color version of ""The Cage,"" once for the novelty of it."
2,I wish they had made separate DVD's,"I wish they had put ""The Cage"" on its own DVD, that way there would be no chance of even accidentally seeing ""Turnabout Intruder"". TI was a sad way for Trek to bow out its run, with maybe the most overused & tired cliche in SF: The Gender Switch."
4,Pure Delight!,"I have been a Ronald Dahl fan since I was a kid. As a child, I loved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and its sequel. I recently discovered The Giraffe, The Pelly and Me.It is pure delight! The characters, and plot are fun and unexpected. It is full of humor and surprises. Good and silly to the very last page. My children loved it.As a mom, I love that Ronald Dahl does not 'talk down' to children in his books. The vocabulary is rich and flows beautifully.Fun for any age, I recommend it especially for a family read aloud."
4,The Marvelous Ladderless Window-Cleaning Company catches a robber!,"The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me is both funny and serious at the same time. The Ladderless Window-Cleaning Company consists of a giraffe as the ladder, a pellican as the water bucket, a monkey doing the washing, and a kid named Billy as their manager. While they cleaning the Duke of Hampshire, they help catch a robber. This is Roald Dahl's 3rd best book!"
5,"Do you feel depressed, frustrated and uninspired? It's time to Live Your Live With Passion!","I heard Anthony Robbins from Jay Abraham and Brian Tracy sales training series. Since most of our life struggles and challenges come our ability to deal with the problems that come into our life, I recommend this CD series for those of you who feel depressed, frustrated and uninspired.The Live With Passion, Anthony Robbins CDs are amazing! After I listened to these CDs, I went ahead and bought $300 worth more of his CDs because what Anthony Robbins really brings back what I have learned in the past from great mentors, like Earl Nightingale, John Cummuta, Brian Tracy, Jay Abraham, Zig Ziglar and so on.I am extremely excited to be able to listen to Anthony Robbins' wisdom and advice, because it has helped me to take charge of my life.Must listen CDs!"
5,THANK YOU TONY ROBBINS FOR CHANGING OUR LIVES,"Tony Robbins is the BEST! His advice, presentation are passion are INCREDIBLE! We are currently creating The Spaceship Discovery Science and Technology Center, a futuristic Museum designed to save the planet. (www.spaceship discovery.com). I would like to meet him to personally thank him for all the inspiration he has put us on the path to success. As the President/CEO of what we hope will be a world class endeavor I can say that It has and will take a combination of massive action and infinite courage on the part of everyone involved. However the results will be spectacular thanks to the skills that Tony Robbins offers. Tony's books and audio CD's are a life changing event! Thank you Tony! Floyd T. Holt President/CEO The Spaceship Discovery"
5,A superb interpretation and an incredibly refined performanc,"I myself am an aspiring pianist and have performed the Schumann concerto. In preparing for my own performance, I shopped around for recordings of this concerto, and bought those of Sequeira Costa, Radu Lupu, Evgeny Kissin, and Artur Rubenstein. I like each of these recordings, but Costa's is my favorite. Obviously, of these men all are great pianists, and I would not feel qualified to rank one above another, but Costa's playing to me reflects most perfectly Schumann's intentions. Costa's cadenza in particular stands out as the most exhilarating. His maturity, refinement, and grace are especially appropriate and crucial for this beautiful piece. When I saw the price at which it was listed, I was shocked. Though it's a great bargain, this CD really does deserve to be priced on par with the other recordings I mentioned above. The more one listens to this concerto, the more one loves it, and I can say the same about this recording."
5,The pictures are worth every penny!,"This is a lovely book that uses simple words and ideas to tell us how many wonderful things we can do with our hands. We work, play, fight, love and explore our vast world with them. The black-and-white photographs depict people of many ages and races doing things with their hands...so powerful are the pictures that the words almost seem secondary to the book itself. Great book for young children!"
1,A Lot of Money for a Very Little,"Don't be fooled by the name ""Emeril"" on this knife. This is a light duty knife at best. The blade is extremely thin and has little or no weight. Spend a few extra dollars and get a knifewith more quality and more weight."
2,Break City,"All right here's the thing. I bought a 12 pack of these, or maybe 10 pack--somewhere there, at a local Target a few mos prior, for a dollar. Pleased with them, they weren't artist quality or anything but they worked and sharpened fine. These sad excuses for coloring pencils that you're looking at now, although offered by the same company, are paltry in comparison. I have no idea why, but they are crap. Break when sharpened about 75% of the time. The lead isn't glued properly to the inside of the barrel (if that is the correct terminology here). They're just bad. Get a different brand."
3,I'm no a connoisseur,"I bought these for occasional use in marking rooms on arch. plans as reviewed. They work for that easy challenge. For artist and/or grade-school use, I, being neither, am not qualified to comment. In any case, can't beat the price."
5,magnífico,"Este es el mejor disco del grupo porque nos muestra todas sus facetas. Es inigualable la forma en la que Mikel y Diego logran interpretar muchas canciones clásicas y le dan un nuevo sonido y tono.Sólo escuchen ""La casa azul"", ""Rozando la eternidad"", ""Entre salitre y sudor"" y ""Palabras sin nombre"" y me darán la razón.Si algún día pueden conseguir un proveedor que tenga el disco, asegúrense de que sea la versión en disco doble."
4,Not as good as the original but still worthwhile,"Before the Alien drama became old, this followup seemed a pretty good deal. The story was a continuation with Ripley being found in her pod by settlers who just happened to have been involved in locating some aliens. There is a big fight and Ripley saves a little girl. Lots of action - not a lot of thought. Still fun, though."
3,Be forewarned......,"I'd give this product 5 stars but......-1 Star for being in DVD-R format. The description doesn't mention this. Check your DVD player before purchasing to make sure it plays DVDs in the DVD-R format. My el-cheapo DVD player doesn't! I had to watch this on my parents' DVD player. Combine that with....-1 star for having to buy 9 DVDs to get the whole series! There are 18 (1/2 hour?) episodes, with 2 episodes per DVD. At $10 per DVD, that's $90 for the series!!! Most tv series on DVD are less than $50 and are less than 5 DVDs.The show itself was good. I was just miffed I spent $90 on the DVDs, only to have them not play in my machine! Luckily I didn't return them, because I know a DVD-player-upgrade is in the future."
2,In two words... Pompous and staid!,"If this is what ""decorator"" done rooms look like -thanks but no thanks, I'll stick with DIY! Nothing ""life-enhancing"" that I see... nooo personality and absolutely nothing fresh! I DO deserve beautiful rooms and won't find them here."
1,Always the same,"Perla Lichi doesn't have any other concepts to decorate rooms, or what...? Is she married to the old world look? All the magazines containing her advertising show the same photographs as the book; what was the purpose of writing a book if you are not going to show anything new?Pathetic; couldn't be worse!!"
2,2 versions of this single for the completist,"The limited initial digipak version has the tracks1. On My Mind2. Sweetness(""Bandroom"" demo version)3. On My Mind (""Bandroom"" demo version)4. This Song Has Gone to Hell (Studio outtake)The jewel case edition has the songs1. On my mind2. Sweetness 02.23 (demo)3. Rocket reducer 62Every single one of the songs above is either your typical mainstream rock or power ballad. Very mediocre, very boring and gone is the originality which made powderfinger so loved initially.gets 2 stars because it is at least consistent."
5,The Camels of Old Camp Verde,"This book is proof in black and white that the U.S. government thought outside the box twice: first with the Constitution and Bill of Rights and then an experiment to use camels in the American southwest. Details on the journey, the purchases (I didn't realize that the Crimean War used camels thus making camels difficult to purchase.), the nature of the camels, the reluctance of the soldiers assigned to take care of and manage the camels, the impact on Texas communities from the coast to the Alamo and eventually Camp Verde. Don't miss any book on the Camp Verde camel experiment, but start this one.Anne Stewart"
4,good use of evidence,"Lefkowitz and Rogers do an excellent job of showing why afrocentric thinking is both incorrect and naive in this book. They spend a good deal of time reviewing the development of such racist theories, however, that they address specific claims in brief terms. I don't think this book would change many opinions but it is good to know that even today, challenges to new ideas can be done with intelligence."
1,Not what I thought,This book is cheesy and kind of boring. I was looking for a little interesting reading but this wasn't it.
3,Good quality....but not a good fit,"I got these mats for my wife's Toyota Yaris '10. While checking on the website, it showed that the mats would fit the car perfectly but they do not. You have to do a lot of pushing and shoving to get them into place. There still jut out a bit under the seat. Even the little knob like things that act as placeholders for the mats do not align with that of the car. On the positive note though, the quality of the mats is great. They seem sturdy and strong enough to take a beating for a long time."
5,great book,"* Easy to understand* Easy to read* Website filled with quizes, links, glossary for each chapter, etc.* Awesome extras if you buy the book new (ex: online tutors and other links)"
5,Thanks Jim!,"This book was an eye opening look at our Texas prison system. Jim Willett is a man of integrity that had a difficult job to perform. The book is well written and a must read for anyone that ever wondered what it is like inside ""The Walls"". My husband and I both enjoyed his story."
1,This Movie is a Piece:,My two year old daughter won't even watch this.Don't waste your time!!The graphics are so bad.First semester animation students make stuff better than this!And the voice acting is horrible.Completely boring/dumb story.Thank God it was so short.
1,They have to be kidding...,"This program is HORRIBLE. We Netflixed this beast instead of buying, thank goodness. It is so darn bad! From the blatant attempt to rip off ""Cars"" to the terrible things they say to each other, it is just awful. I kept thinking it would get better, but it felt more like a powerpoint presentation of how to be smarmy jerks."
1,Barney is better than this 'movie'.,"I won't waste much energy on this, but I will say a couple of things. First, this movie is AWFUL. Second, it is only 45 minutes long and the graphics look like something made in 1992. The production budget on this must have been a few hundred dollars. Did I mention this was AWFUL?It appears to be a ""Cars"" knock-off, but it doesn't even qualify as a knock-off.Thankfully, I only rented this movie.... and even then, I still feel ripped off."
1,Very poor quality,i was extremely disappointed with this product...it skipped in many places and froze in others. I was very disappointed as this was a gift for my grandson.
1,Disappointment,"I thought I was ordering Roary the Racing cars videos, since these popped up when I put that in the search. I ordered 3. They came quickly but were not what I ordered. At this time of year, it was easier to keep them and donate them to Toys For Tots."
1,Terrible for children,"Not only is this movie absolutely poorly made, but it uses language that is not suitable for young children. Insulting language and all of the previously mentioned review items makes this one of the poorest movies imaginable. It's like getting scammed by deceiving spam."
3,"A letdown, after some others","There are some good riding sequences here, but too many are second-rate; sad part is, I can't GIVE the DVD away!"
5,Wonderful album - shame about the track errors,"While indeed a truly wonderful, five star classic release, it is important to note a major mistake in this issue. While the track listing on the CD packaging does reflect the contents of the original album, the CD itself is in fact missing one track, and has two others mislabelled. ""Beginning"" does not appear on this disc. Track 5 is actually what is listed as track 9, ""In D"", and track 9, rather than ""In D"", is an alternate mix of ""Sketch For Winter"" (track 7)."
4,cute starter cage!,"I used to have CritterTrail cages when I was younger and I absolutely hated them. My hamsters would always escape and assembly was a nightmare. I'm a bit older now, so obviously they've been remodeled and I actually really love these new improvements! My robo dwarf loves this cage; it has a lot of room for about 3 inches of bedding, a spring-loaded hinge on the door (THANK GOD), and a removable lookout on top which makes it easy for me to grab him when it's time to put him in his exercise ball. My only complaints are that the original wheel and water bottle are quite loud and my little robo ham has to stretch himself to make it up the tube on the side. Other than that, this cage is super cute and super great! I've had it for a little over a year and it's still in excellent condition (I've only exchanged the wheel for a silent spinner). I highly recommend it. (:"
3,Doesn't hold together well,"We purchased this habitat for our child's new hamster at Petsmart (for $15 less than amazon, btw). The cage is very cute and neat. The wheel was a bit difficult to attach, but not a big deal. The removable carrier was a nice feature. But, the integrity of the cage was pretty shotty. The areas where the plastic top and bottom meet the wire parts is not very solid or strong. We have dogs and cats in our home, and they absolutely destroyed the cage...and ate the hamster. I gave it three stars, though, because it is a very cute and functional cage. Just be warned, if you have other animals in your home that are able to be in the same room with the cage, tragedy will soon follow."
5,Great,Yoggi my daughters hamster absolutly loves ths cage. My daughter loved it because it was pink. We added some tunnles to it and he just flys through them all the time.
2,Small mice escape through wires.,"I bought this cage to put mice into after I caught them in my mobile home using a live mouse trap I also bought at the same time, and then I use this cage to tranfer the mice to some woods I own and release them there in the woods.But I found out that smaller mice would escape through spaces between wires in the cage, so I had to go the hardware store and buy some wire mesh that had smaller holes then the cage has, and then wired the wire mess all the way around the inside of the cage, so I don't think even the smallest mice will escape now."
2,squeaker,Well I've had the cage for a while and my ham loves to run.The only problem is that the wheel is starting to speak really loud. Now we have to take out the wheel so I get enough sleep for school.If your ham loves to run it might not be a good idea for you to get this cage.
3,Just so so,"This cage is very cute and easy to clean. Our dwarf hamster does seem happy in it. The wheel is pretty good...a little noisy, but not too bad. However, the cage is not made very well. The top doesn't seem to fit that snugly against the bottom, and we have already had to superglue one of the little brackets back on. We also purchased a better water bottle for the cage because I wasn't sure the hamster was getting enough water through the one that is provided. This is our first hamster and cage, so I have nothing to compare it to...but I would have hoped this one would have been constructed a little better."
3,Works O.K,It's ok i don't like that mutch the wheel makes a horable noise all i can say is take my idvice it is NOT quite.
2,Hollowed Out!,"This ring is hollowed out, and therefore not as comfortable as a ring that isn't. I only wore it a few times and gave it to charity."
4,Great Book,"This book is much needed by Pastors and Councellors! It is very informative, and proves that there is a ""trend"" even among those who consider themselves ""christian"". It also shows pastors how to point them in the right direction according to God's Word."
3,not as good,"This is the reissue of the album of the same titled released in 1985. The Varukers were never a diverse band , and they weren't catchy either but could pound and thrash some hardcore punk into the veins of anyone daring to listen. However the songs on this album sound pretty much exactly the same , and it gets very boring and there is no difference in any of the tracks because the exact same chord progressions are used track after track. But if you want something just to thrash around to then get this...just don't expect much diversity or a song that will stick in your head afterwards"
4,Fish think they're yummy,I use these in a food mix I put in my automatic feeder to feed my nocturnal catfish and plecos. They seem to enjoy it and look strong and healthy.
5,It's fish food. What's not to like.,"So, what can I say about this besides it's economically priced, it sinks as described, and hey, fish eat it. 'nuff said."
2,Too soft,"My pleco's eat it, but only if they get to it in time! It softens and breaks down too quickly, causing dirty gravel/filters. Tetra Plecowafers lasts much longer."
4,Tank Favorite,"All the fish in my tank love these little discs, even my Cichlids enjoys eating them.These are high quality and it's true they do no cloud the tank."
5,Tiny tiny,"Tiny, tiny lil wafers. Did not realize these were so small, but that works out good. These fit in tiny fish mouths much easier. The catfish and sucker fish like them so I can't complain."
3,"classic, but a little out of date","This book has long been considered as a must read before doing research in this field. Without doubt, it contains all you need to know about model checking in general. However, it is a little difficult to read for beginners, and also, since it was written 10 years ago, some new advances are not included. Moreover, it puts more emphasis on CTL than LTL, or more ""states"" than ""paths"". It is OK, but more difficult to introduce fairness and infinite paths. Personally, I recommend ""Principles of Model Checking"" by Christel Baier. But still, you may need a copy of this one in your bookshelf."
5,This book is part of me.,I am glad I am not the only one who has read and reread With Love Form Karen so many times. I have probably read this book more times than I have read any other book in my life. This story inspired me because like Karen I was born with a birth defect. I am not disabled but Karen's story gave me the courage to face the obstacles in my own life (they paled in comparison to what Karen faced). Marie does focus a lot on Gloria and I feel this as well as the tragic fire that killed three of Little Marie and Gloria's children lead to estraingment later on. The family is old world and very private and will not make their individual stories public. Today they would be on the talk show circuit and making a movie deal. I respect that but it would be nice to know what has happened to them. I always felt there should be a movie but that wont happen because none of the family members will take part in it.
1,the shore,"The beach was a very scary place in the seventies. I remember being a kid when this movie came out and wanting to see it so badly. I've kept that reference in my head for about twenty years before I got ahold of a copy of this flick on ebay. it really is bad, but i make my friends watch it all the time. we especially like the scientist who states that this creature is "" still in the process of evolution.""hmmm. i guess the rest of us are finished with that evolution stuff.you'd pretty much be a fool for buying this, but then again, at times, it's almost bad enough to be funny. Too bad MST3K hasn't ever attacked this one."
1,Joint Support Powder,I don't know how well this product works as my dog refuses to eat any food it is mixed into. It smells bad and he thinks it is very unappetizing.
2,No Summary Of Course!,"This book does not give a summary of the course! It tells you concepts you need to know (ex. colonization) but it doesn't tell you about it. The author admits the practice tests are much harder than the actual AP, which could be a good thing for practice but not realistic. I haven't taken the AP yet, but one things for sure...I'm buying another book."
3,"Disappointed, but we found the solution to the non-holding clip","These particular clips don't have the strength to hold, but the shape is better. They make my wife's office very colorful since she now uses all for holding papers together. BUT, take heart, if you can stand the fact that they're black, the OXO Good Grips Stacking Magnetic All-Purpose Clips and OXO Good Grips Stacking Magnetic Heavy Duty Clips are GRRRRReat.I still don't understand the magnet, but if you get the ones that don't work, you can hang the kids drawings on the refrigerator."
5,In the Beginning,"This is where it starts (maybe); the epic History of Dom Manuel of Poictesme (pronounced pwa-tem), progenitor of a clan that stretches from pre-revolutionary France to the American South and includes Kings of England and Shakespeare. Cabell was witty, erudite and scandalous,,,by far the finest, widely unknown fantasist ever produced in America. Only for those who relish dense language and wisdom that is inevitable."
4,Dead and Buried by Hazel Holt,"A good book, but when I bought it and started reading it, I realized I had bought and read it under another title. It is also known as Death Among Friends. Be careful when purchasing, as some of Ms. Holt's books are being re-issued under different names."
4,"Nice, but a bit too small","This is a memory card like any other, save it's size. SD, in general, is a great format to add a bit of memory in. I use it in my PDA, and it helps to add that bit of storage I need. However, the space on this card runs out quickly. My advice: upgrade to the 128 or the 256."
1,R.L.P.,"I think that the author owes the readers an inside look of her early to mid teen years, where such knowledge and insight must have played a crucial if not hectic mind game with herself and all of those that she tried to take down with her in her attempt to understand ""THE MELDING""."
5,I am *so* in Awe at the things revealed by reading this book,"I was given a copy of this book by the author herself, through whatever cosmic forces, and I am now adding it to the front page of my Amazon associates store. If I could, I would donate copies to every library in existance. The things this book make you think about, not only in context of the writting, but for yourself, are outstanding! I feel this is a MUST READ for anyone who is working on self advancement."
1,Enlightened or gullible?,"I could not help but wonder if Roxy isn't just being gullible? What better way to cheat on your partner and get away with it than to convince her/him that this is all for her/his ""spiritual development""? There were some good and interesting points made, but my final feelings abou the book were just to feel sorry for the author who is not only letting others fool her, but is fooling herself."
1,louise?,"This all sounds somewhat....Deja vu? Could it be that I have been ""Melded"" in a past life? Or am I about to be ""Melded"" here and now? OOOOOHHHHH! Just the thought of it makes me want to skip and jump! I just can't wait. How will I know when I'm being ""Melded""? Will I see it? Taste it? Hear it? Or just feel a gentle tug on my leg. Regardless of how I will find out, you can bet that I will have one TIGHT grip on my wallet."
1,save your money,"The amazon web site indicates this will work with newer versions of Win but it does NOT work with Win 7 - which is all there is now a days. The web site does not indicatre that now - how odd is that. We wasted money because we only havec WIN 7 and now our lkittle child has NOTHING and we have useless software. Do NOT buy this if you have a new laptop or computer. Also, we loaded this on our OLD computer with an old version of Win and looked at it and it is terribly basic stuff - maybe 3 or 4 year old, but 5 and 6 year olds will be bored."
4,"Old fashioned look, but great fun and learning","My favorites on this disc of many worthwhile games are (1) they give you a ""blueprint"" of a train or something, and you build it out of its pieces, and (2) a nature scene where you click on different animals and plants and it talks about them. You can do the scene in each of 4 seasons, each with different details.There is nothing visually stunning about this game. It doesn't load pages fast, and is pretty all-around low-tech. But it holds my 4 year old's attention and I feel that she is learning from it. Based on my experience with this, I probably won't buy more Sammy's House series games, but I don't regret this purchase."
2,Out of date educational game,The age range recommend by the publisher is 3-7 and was first copyrighted/ published in 1995. It didn't look it they made any changes/ improvements at all. I bought this for my science loving 5-year and I was quickly disappointed. The window the game was quite small and didn't take up the entire computer screen which made it eye straining to see. The graphics and animations were old and not very interactive. A child can do a lot clicking here or there to sort and sequence but it doesn't explain much to satisfy a 5-year old curiosity. PBS[...] website has better well thought-out science activities than Sammy's Science House.
4,Take Me to the Pub!,"This album is great, although not as good as Our Fathers Sent Us. It sounds a bit more like the Swingin' Utters, so it lost some of the unique flavor from the first album. But other than that, it is outstanding!"
2,Disapoointed,"For some reason this dvd does not work in our player. It reads as ""blank disk"" - have not yet been able to watch this movie."
2,Bland,"Be warned: The mood of the poster is nothing like that of the film. This is not a film of excitement, mystery, or any type of emotion at all. Except mild frustration. And that might even be too strong a descriptor.There are too many great documentaries out there (and more coming by the day) to devote time to this one. The positive reviews got me to give this a shot, but I don't see where they're coming from. This film isnt bad, but its a long way from being anywhere near good."
1,I already gave this a bad review....I never got the product.,"I already reviewed this....I never got the product...according to Amazon, postal problem which was too bad for me. I am not repeating the narrative here...I've done it twice already. No more Amazon purchases for me."
2,Poorly organized and structured presentation of all the data and history of the Barnes.,The story did not flow well.I did not like the way it came across.The Barnes story is a fascinating one. I would like to have seen fewer interviews and more concise story telling.
4,Art Versus Money,"A 25 billion dollar art collection is slowly manipulated. I was initially very sympathetic to the deceased owner's wishes until I thought ""why shouldn't this work be shown every day?"" It's absurd not to. The owner had reasons for hiding them away, but the rich snobs he wanted to cut out are long dead now. They belong in a museum. It's more fair that they stay in Philly than NYC, LA, or Chicago."
5,For art aficiandos,A fascinating story about an exceptional art collection and what occurred by individuals manipulating to get it into public viewing. The underpinnings of the art world sometimes are not very pretty. Great story for all those interested in this aspect of our culture.
2,Movie defends a silly position,"This could have been a good movie if it were not so absurdly one-sided. I just visited the new Barnes in downtown Philly and found it to be splendid. This is the museum that according to the movie is a travesty. Art is still displayed in the idiosyncratic manner intended by Barnes, but now people can actually visit. The movie glorifies the fact that practically no one could see the collection. The art in the old Barnes, according to the logic of this movie, was there for the benefit of a rarefied, elect few, and that was a good thing. That strikes me as a peculiar position to defend."
3,"Small simple book, best for children","The book was very thin and written as if it were for children. It is informative, but was not real exciting."
1,HP Cameras don't last very long,"I would not recommend any HP camera. This camera was an upgrade from one that broke down a month after the warranty was up, and that one was an upgrade from one that broke 2 months after the warranty was up. I'm not getting another! None of the 3 HP cameras I had could be repaired. The only option I was offered was to upgrade. For the upgrade I sent my old camera back and paid slighly less that I would if I bought a new one. They sent me a ""new"" camera. It was a refurbished camera, not new. None of the damage on any of my 3 cameras was through carelessness or misuse. The first 2 cameras gave me error messages and shut off. I was told this was an internal problem that could not be fixed. On the third camera the screen went blank. It can't be fixed. I'm going to do a lot of research before buying my next camera, but one thing I'm sure of - it won't be an HP!"
5,Excellent,"Camera arrived well packaged and with all necessary accessories,, works greatand has all the functions I appreciate in a small, compact digital camera.The price was good tooLouis"
2,good while it lasted,"bought this camera for a class and it gave me many problems, but when it worked it worked well. The battery will not last and the screen cracked on me very quickly. So good for the price i guess but not for the long run"
3,Be informed.....,"Bought an HP Photosmart R717 in the summer of 2005 for $324.74. 4 months after the camera warranty was up and after minimal usage the camera was displaying: 0000000F-10FB-1BD-024 Error Message, on the display screen.When I called HP about getting my camera repaired I was told that it would be too expensive to repair. I was informed it would cost around $200.00 dollars to receive most likely a refurbished replacement camera, with only a 3-month warranty.After trying the replacement camera for 15 days I was then to send my old camera back as partial payment for the replacement camera.I told HP no thanks, because they had already gotten enough money from me."
3,lesser Earle still better than greater Springsteen,"The only one of Earle's major label records out of print in America, The Hard Way was Earle's Big Rock Move, with that mid-to-late 80s sheen to the production and arrangements that lean towards Springsteenish populist bombast. It has only a handful of classics, including the deliberately silly ""Regular Guy,"" the melodramatic ""Esmeralda's Hollywood"" and ""Justice in Ontario"" and the vicious ""The Other Kind,"" my personal fave. It also has ""Billy Austin,"" a character study of a convicted killer on death row that presaged his future political obsession with the death penalty. As the reviewer below notes, this is not the Earle album to start with, but diehard fans have gotta have it. Not a great album, but not a bad one either."
3,Great Writing/Not-so-Great production,"I consider many of Steve's albums to be 5 Star work, including El Corazon, Jerusalem, TransBlues, Revolution, most of the rest fall into my 4 Star category. I really like most of the songs on this album but the production is not up to usual standards. The vocals sound as though they're bouncing out of a cave and the percussion on a number of songs is annoying at best, the drummer apparently in love with a rat-a-tat-tat riff that overpowers the music. Overall, though, worth owning and a must for competists."
5,Bleak and beautiful,"Most people don't write or play so well without any impediments. ""Hard Way"" came to be during the worst of Earle's drug addiction and it's clearly a crucible time for him. Writing's amazing as always--singing and orchestration are also good. Of course, as many folks way, Steve can't make a bad CD.""Billy Austin"" is one of the hardest songs I've ever heard. Earle can write and sing from the point of view of an outlaw better than almost anyone I've heard. ""Justice in Ontario"" continues that theme. Ironic Earle himself followed this CD with time in prison.This CD's labeled country, but I'm seeing too many rock elements to leave it strictly at that."
5,Steve Earle - The Hard Way,The title of the album probably best describes how Steve was doing things when this album was released. I think this album along with Copperhead Road & his earlier releases are definitely his best works. Personally this album is one of my favorite Steve Earle albums & should be in any true Steve Earle cd collection.
3,"Not his best, but..........","This recording is not without its highlights, even though it was recorded while Earle was in the midst of dealing with his well chronicled drug problems. A lesser known gem appearing here is ""When the People Find Out"", a buzzsaw of a tune which is an odd marriage of a sometimes ragged Earle vocal with a gospel choir. It's reason enough to buy this CD by itself."
2,A CD only for die hard fans,"There are a few diamonds in a lot in rough on this cd. This is one of those in between album's that you can do with or without. For a true fan it just opens another door into showing Earle's promise that was filled in his earlier albums and that shines through brilliantly on all of his recent cds. With Earle producing some of his best work right now, I'd get in tune with any of his newer cd's (my favorite El Corazon) or start off with The Essential cd."
4,Some of his best,"If you are a die hard Steve Earle fan, this is his best and a must. The Other Kind is simply the best song he has ever done, and arguably the best song ever written. Justice Ontario is right behind it, and there are at least 3 very good more. Five great songs is not a bad album. And yet if you're just getting started on my main man, I do recommend Copperhead Road and Exit O first."
1,These reviews are...a little off...,"All these folks giving this record 4 and 5 stars are nuts. This one is well known as being Earle's worst record, and it lives up to the reputation. Now, I am not putting down Earle. Anyone with such a wonderful and long career is going to have a clunker or two. You just simply cannot compare this record to his first three (Guitar Town, Exit 0, Copperhead Road) or the four studio records that followed it (Train a Comin, I Feel Alright, El Corazon, and The Mountain). If you are new to Steve Earle, try any of those seven first. If you ain't hooked after that, then I can only guess it's because you're a fan of crap like Pat Green."
1,Literary theft,"The title story, ""After the Plague,"" takes its plot directly from George Stewart's great novel, Earth Abides. No one can write like T. Coraghessan Boyle, but he should acknowledge that the idea for his story was not his own. He didn't even change the location."
4,Insightful and to the Point,"Dr. MacArthur starts with the premise that God has a will and is willing to make it known to us. That's a pretty good foundation upon which to base a book with this title. Before an individual can know God's will, he must have a relationship with God, therefore the prerequisite is to become born again, born of the spirit, as he explains in the second chapter.From there he goes on to discuss spiritual gifts, noting that the best way to discover your gift is to observe yourself. In the last chapter he offers some particularly useful teachings on God's will and open and closed doors. His discussion includes the practical and the spiritual. This book will help you to discover God's purpose for your life."
3,Audiobook Review,"Well-known theologian John MacArthur writes this encouraging book on how to find Christian purpose and the direction G-d wants in your life. Narrated by John Haag, this audio edition sounds how one would expect MacArthur to speak at a small conference or private study. Haag reads clearly and concisely, permitting the listener to not get caught up on the details of the writing, but capture the message as a whole. The book seems a bit complex for an afternoon listen, but might fit well for excerpts to be played at a small group Bible study.The rest, and disclosures, are available at scriptedgenius (dot) com."
5,Great little book.,"A great little book that will make you take a look at you view God, and His will for our lives."
4,God's will for your life,"There are instances when you don't want to spoil the content of a movie or a book. For this matter, I can't tell you what exactly the book contains, except that it WILL reveal God's will for YOUR life. It may be surprising in light of common attitude to this particular question. Back cover says ""Get ready for a surprise"". So, I agree with that and recommend anybody who is interesting in knowing(and applying) God's will for their lives to read this short book. It can be read in couple hours.Short, but beneficial, and interesting reading."
2,Going in the trash,"I received this as a gift. Thank god I didn't pay for this on my own or I'd really be upset. It is so cheaply made and hardly even opens a can. It starts to open it, but then dies out half way through, leaving you stuck with half of an open can with really sharp edges. You then have to pry the rest of the lid open with your fingers or actually use pliers or some type of other tool to get it open. Not good!!!! It also states that this opener accomodates ""tall"" cans as well. Uhhh not the cans I have tried to open. Also the magnet that is supposed to hold the can up while it is opening the lid is very flimsy and has no strength to it, so the can constantly falls until you can make that first hole with the top of can opener. Needless to say I am searching for a new one as we speak because this one is going in the garbage!"
2,Forget this one,"I have only been successful with about three cans with this thing.The press down lever works it's way out of the body and falls to the counter, and some cans just won't fit the opening mechanism.It's easier and less stressful to use a good manual can opener."
3,Oster 3147 Can Opener,We purchased this an opener at Target. Same price no shipping cost. It's a pretty good can opener and will grab and hold regular and large size cans however it won't hold small cans AT ALL. Little cans like chopped green chilies and olives fall out on the counter so I had to have my husband open them with a manual can opener. We also don't find it that quiet and the handle you press down on the can is rather flimsy. So we'll see how it holds up.
4,"Works Great, Looks Great, LOUD","The metalic look is exactly what I wanted for my kitchen. The can opener works great. It would be a 5 rating except for one thing. This is the loudest can opener I have ever had...and I have had some loud ones before. If you can stand the noise, it works well and looks great in your kitchen."
3,Still deciding.....,"This is an ok appliance. However, its not silent...at all. But it does the job and is durable. The looks are fine and Im pretty happy with it.UPDATE... Have been using this opener for about a week now and it is doing just fine. Even though it isnt as silent as expected, the opener is performing well. The magnetic lid catcher is just fine and yet to have any problems with this item. Just thought I would let some of you know how its performing after several uses. Good luck and happy can opening...lol"
1,Worst can opener I've ever used.,I would rather use a hand crank can opener. Very difficult to position the can so it locks in and opens. Peels paper off can as it turns. Looks good on countertop but functions poorly.
5,Great product!,"This is an inexpensive, but very handy can opener. I've not had any trouble with it and it looks great too."
4,OSTER 3157 TALL CAN OPENER,WORKS VERY WELL I USED IT OVER THE HOLIDAYS AND WAS VERY SATISFIED I WILL KEEP IT UNTIL I FIND SOMETHING BETTER
1,Don't do it!!!,If you are even thinking about ordering this product STOP....it is JUNK. I have two of them and neither one is working. Both are less then two years old.
5,Best Can Opener,"I have not been the luckiest person in the world concerning can openers. I've bought expensive ones and cheap ones, even in between. When I ordered this one I was a little skeptic, but when I used it for the first time, my skepticism flew out the window. It opens smoothly every time. I am extremely satisfied with this product."
4,Nice can opener...nice price,"Love the height of the can opener and it works well. My only issue with it is that the handle is flush with the body of the can opener - makes the lines of the appliance look better but makes it difficult to lift it up to stop the rotation. It will automatically stop (as most will) once it completely cuts open the can, but I prefer to stop the cutting just shy of complete rotation so as to stop the top of the can from being totally cut all the way around...just my preference. Other than that it's great."
3,"Just so so, you get what you pay for!","This works, but I do not see it lasting long. The top part that is supposed to hold the can in place keeps coming out like it is not fastened or screwed into anything. Hard to place can under the cutting tool. would not recommend, better to spend a little more if you plan on using it regularly."
1,Unbelievably Noisy,"I ordered this can opener because we've recently started swapping out our old white/off white appliances with black and brushed steel appliances. The color matched beautifully, and the sleek design really pops, but it's HORRIFYINGLY noisy! The first time I used it, I literally jumped because I wasn't prepared for such a loud noise from such a small device. My husband can even hear it upstairs with the door closed! I would not buy this product again, nor would I recommend it to a friend (unless I no longer want to be friends, LOL)"
3,works good,it sounds like it strugles to open but it does open fine and clean cut and no other problems 2 weeks
4,Pretty good,"It is a pretty good one, it always works and is easy to clean. It does handle large cans better than most."
3,just ok,"Replacing a nicer cuisinart one with this one and you can tell. It works fine, but is a little funny on the mechanism. Have to line it up just perfect to get it to work."
3,An eye-opening experience for any reader.,"Hongda Wu's book is an eye-opener for any reader. However, Wu is unable to make the reader empathize with him; the reader never truly understands why Wu chooses, more than once, to risk all he has to return to China. In addition, Wu's chronology may confuse the reader, leaving the reader lost as to what happened next. Wu's description of his love for his wife is touching; however, his writing style is a bit dry"
4,great product,this is a nifty very small musical device that I use when exercising. its great - holds all the songs I can listen to and is so portable. I really like it
2,theres diffinately better,"ive had this MP3 play for about a year. in the begining it was ok for the price but since then the sound on it has been completely shot, the battery door has broken twice and gotten lost, and it can now be split in half. only suggested for short term use."
5,ZEN MP3 Player,Great Player for $$$$Still going strong after much useby boys for a year.Recommend to purchaseExtra FM radio included is great
5,great,this is a great little mp3 player for our kids to begin learning how to take care of such items!!! They are thrilled! It does work with a mac computer even though it says it does not! great sound and easy to use.
2,"Worked for a while, but not that great","I purchased the Zen Nano four months ago. It was working then total system failure. At first I thought the battery was dead, but a new battery didn't help. The screen would flash on and then off. It will not boot up. Plugging it into the computer did no good, it could not be reconized or accessed. It goes in the trash. In addition when it was working the shuffle mode would only play some of the songs stored. Also, the output volumn was to low. I would use it while riding my bike and it needs to be loud enough to hear it over the road noise, it wasn't up to the task. Now it is landfill."
3,mediocore,"One of his weakest works, but still part of his whole. Many of his theories come from the asusmptions in this work. If you are looking to study him in depth than go ahead, if you are looking for his most stimulating ideas than you would probably do better with something a little less scholarly."
2,rather outdated,"Jung wasn't known to be strong on developmental theory, and he proves it in this collection. Sparks of illumination but not much developmental meat to the book."
5,Knife set,"This is a great knife set. The knives are very durable, they look great, and are nice to use. I was surprised at how nicely weighted they are. I like them so much that I got my mother a set for Mother's Day. The only downfall that I can find is the scissors. They are somewhat flimsy but I didn't buy the set for the scissors."
5,Ginsu the New Generation,"I was a little sceptical because Ginsu was an 'As seen on T.V.' product,but my fears were laid to rest when I took the knives out of their package.The weight was good & they feel good.Full tang.Sharp enough for my needs.My previous set of name brand knives were double the price & not as well made.All in all ,I am very happy with this product.I forgot .They also look good."
3,Great knifes but don't get them wet,this set looks great and cuts great but if you leave it in the sink for a day and there is water they will wet rust spots which really sucks.
3,Ginsu Knife Set Scissors,"The knife set is just what we wanted. Sharp, and doesn't requrie resharpening.However, the handles of the scissors included with the set broke the very first time they were used.I still havent figured out how to communicate this to Amazon, as the choices are only; return item or comment.Dont want to return the whole set, just get replacement scissors. Any ideas?"
2,Ginsu knives not as sharp as expected.,The knives have a nicely shaped handle with a hefty feel but I was disappointed to find that they are not as sharp as has always been advertised. I first tried one of the knives on a tomato and as I slowly drew the knife across the tomato it tore the skin rather than cut it! They do OK for less delicate work.
2,These are horrible,"They look nice, but they arent sharp at all. I can hardly cut an onion. I am afraid that I will cut myself when using them because I have to apply so much pressure. They look nice, but perhaps I have a bad set."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I ordered these after scouring the many positive reviews.I could tell I liked the styling from the images, and the many positive reviews made it seem that these would be a great buy. I am no chef, but I am a fairly advanced consumer in the kitchen. Unfortunately, I found these knives heavy, cumbersome, and totally dull. The serrated edge on all the knives was a little confusing - I normally have seen serrated edges on just bread knives or steak knives. Add to it that none of the knives fit snugly in the block. These aren't terrible, they just weren't good, in my opinion. They certainly cut okay, but I didn't like the amount of pressure I had to use to slice through even an onion. Unfortunately I used them once, washed them well and packed them up and shipped them back to Amazon. For the price point they are okay, but they certainly aren't a steal. Better luck next time?"
2,ginsu knives,"I bought a set of ginsu knives back when they first started their infomercials. Those knives today, are sharper than the new 14-piece set I received. The new set was clearly designed for decoration only, and ginsu should be ashamed to put their name on them. As usual, Amazon was superb in their handling of my order."
5,Excellent value!,This is my first complete knife set and I'm very satisfied with the quality. If you are planning on keeping these for a while these shouldn't be put in the dish washer. Very sharp and an excellent deal.
5,Terrific knife set,These are great quality knives. I hand wash them to prevent rusting. They also look very nice in the kitchen. Much better than the traditional wood.
1,"3 months and rusted? So much for ""stainless"" steel.","Length:: 0:53 MinsI've washed these in the dishwasher after every use and after 3 months they're covered in rust spots. They hang on a magnet knife rack and not in the block that they come with, so it's not even like that aren't always 100% dry. I guess stainless steel doesn't mean stainless steel in China."
2,highly disappointed,"I ordered these recently, and have had them for one month. I already have to send back one of the knives due to a loose handle, and the kitchen shears, which are already falling apart.I followed the instructions on the care of these knives, and have not put any of them in the dishwasher. One of the reasons why I purchased these was on account of the great reviews they received. I would not recommend these, and if I were under the 30 day deadline, I would return the entire set."
5,"stylish, sharp!","The knives have been used several times, and I am very impressed with the proper weight and sharpness. Excellent item and a great value!"
5,don't believe bad reviews,I had wanted new knives for a while but never bothered researching or purchasing. Then I noticed my brother-in-law had new knives. After talking about it and feeling the quality I knew I had to buy these for myself. They are extremely sharp so be careful. I store them with the blade facing up in the block so it doesn't wear out the blade or block. Definitely worth the purchase.
4,Good product for the money,For the price this set is a winner. The knives cut well but are not as sharp as I had anticipated. The set is well made and looks good.
1,Dangerous and terrible customer service!!,"I would give these zero stars if I could mostly because I am so frustrated with the customer service! We ordered these in April and in September the knife block itself literally just fell apart (the front piece separated from the back) knives everywhere...luckily no one was near it at the time as these knives are sharp! I contacted customer service, sent them our receipt, and explained the situation...they are being impossible and do not want to replace the block. They told me the only way they can replace it is if one is returned...seriously and they don't even want to do that. I highly doubt we'll get a replacement from them. Save your money and but anything else. These knives are OK but not worth the hassle and DANGER. Very poorly made block, decent knives, terrible customer service."
4,good knives,"I received this product quickly and in good condition. I have only had the knives for a couple of weeks. I agree with some of the other reviews in that some of the slots for the knives are not very good. But the knives are very sharp, and look good in my stainless steel kitchen."
2,Cracked wood block,"I'm normally not someone to complain about a product because I am understanding that no one or no machine is perfect. Upon opening the box and unwrapping the contents I noticed a rather large and noticeable crack on the left side of the block. For a brand new product, I was rather disappointed. The only saving grace of this knife set is the set of knives - so far I haven't run into any problems. Due to the combo of the cracked wood block and wonderful knives, I give this product a measley two stars. Oh and you're probably wondering why I didn't return it - well, I needed the knives for cooking for my new place of residence and therefore, I didn't have the luxury to return the knives. Oh and the price too, but still besides all of this dos estrellas from me."
2,Disappointing,"These knives left a lot to be desired. The block was scratched, the slots for the knives were uneven & the name plate was glued on crooked. For lack of a better term: the whole product just had a cheap, flea-market appearance to it. They aren't worth the money, I returned them right away."
4,A note about stainless steel and dishwashers,"So far these knives have been great, although I just got them. I thought I would mention that I had stainless steel silverware that was always rusting/tarnishing in the dishwasher and when I soaked it in water. I recently purchased another set of silverware made from stainless steel. Interestingly, there was a label on it that said to avoid using lemon soaps, and soaking in water as this will cause rusting/tarnishing. I took this advice and I haven't had any rusting/tarnishing since. Maybe this could explain why some buyers had problems with these knives rusting in the dishwasher. I have noticed that many dishwasher detergents have lemon in them."
4,Great knifes Great price!,"For only $40.00 my husband and I think it's a great value. We're only had them for a short time, but have enjoyed using the entire set."
4,Had to return the 1st set,"Had to return the 1st knife set because the knife block had not been glued together and was in 2 pieces. The 2nd set was sent very quickly and seems fine, except that the knives are not particularly sharp."
2,Just Ok,The knives seem to be made well. I do like the handles on them. What I don't like is the block holder. The knives fit poorly.
2,DO NOT BUY THESE,The knives look good; however after a few uses and washes (not in the dishwasher) they have rust spots. I specifically bought these because it said they don't rust - not true!
5,Wonderful!,"I did a lot of research before finally deciding to purchase this knife set, and I am very pleased with it. The knives are extremely sharp, infact I managed to cut myself taking one out of it's cardboard cover. I have had no problems with this product, it looks just as great as it functions. As per other reviews, I would not place these in the dishwasher for cleaning, simply to avoid rusting over time. If taken care of properly, I can see this set lasting a very, very long time. The price was reasonable, Amazon offered the cheapest (as usual!). I couldn't be happier with this purchase!"
4,Great knife set for the price.,"I couldn't be more happy with this purchase. My old knife set which was also pretty inexpensive had begun to fall apart. The old knifes were purchased for around the same price (less than $40) but were much cheaper construction, rubber/plastic handles and the blades literally snapped off on most of them. These knifes are full metal construction handles and all. They seem to be very well made and have very good edges. My set had a 5"" Santoku that wasn't shown in the picture but other than that I got exactly what is shown."
2,Heavy and rusty,"I bought this set seeing an overall good user review. The cons I can see are:* Seems a bit heavy to me.* The knives also don't seem that much sharp. The serrated blades are not helpful for me. I find the the Santoku knife helpful though for regular use.* After getting them out of dishwasher, I could see yellow stains, though it says dishwasher safe."
5,Super Sharp! Very pleased!,"I wasn't so sure about the ""As seen on TV"" name of Ginsu. I was worried that I would be getting flimsy, light weight knives, boy was I mistaken!! These knives have a nice heavy weight to them, and are not flimsy at all. They are very sharp right out of the box...I even have a cut on my finger to prove it! I am very satisfied with the look of this set, and have used them in the dishwasher without a problem. I have learned from other knives that if you use a little scouring powder such as Bon-Ami on spotted knives they will clean right up. I've not had to do that with this set yet. I am very pleased with this set, and couldn't imagine having knives that were any sharper!"
4,Great Knife Set............,"I was skeptical at first, but after a few weeks of owning this knife set, I can honestly say I am extremely pleased with my purchase. Top notch quality, and very sharp right out of the box. I like the variations of the length of the knives included and the black case with stainless steel look fantastic in my kitchen. Highly recommend!"
2,Sent back,I bought this set for my father for Christmas. It looks terrific. I cannot judge the knives as they were never used. The block easily fell forward with the slightest tap. We considered it quite dangerous and packed it up and returned it.
1,"Quality, but some issues","I like the knives, they are good quality. However, disappointingly, there are issues. For some reason the Santoku was missing from my set - two chef's knives were sent instead. Also, the block is a mismatch for the set. Be careful with this purchase."
5,Excellent Professional Quality Knives,"Excellent buy. I love cooking and entertaining and these knives have cut my food preparation time in half because of their high quality efficieny but, be careful I've knicked myself countless times already just cleaning the blades. The knives are extremely sharp and just a brush across it will draw blood. The first time I cut myself was pullign them out the box. You can't touch the blade at all without cutting yourself but,that says a lot about the quality. I won't need to sharpen these knives for years to come if ever."
2,Made in China Stainless steel rusts within an hour,"When I opened the box, I was literally thrilled with these knives. An all stainless steel knife and handle set that should survive years of dishwasher use. The dream ended quickly. They rust within an hour if not kept dry. These ""Japanese"" knives are stamped made in China. After a year, I'm still using them but regularly have to scour them with vinegar and scotchbrite to remove rust. I've worked and welded many types of stainless steel but have never seen it rust so quickly. I wonder if they've scrimped on chromium content.They are very substantial and functional but not worth the upkeep. I've heard others describe them as ""Gypsu knives"" and wholeheartedly concur."
1,Not a life time knife,"Bought them almost 18 month ago,the sharp part has already fell off the handle on most of them.I would not buy them again."
3,Came with missing knife,Great product - however.. im missing one knife. Package was sealed when i received it but i couldnt find one knife. I bet its the one i needed (one of the big ones). Oohh and i cut myself with one last time - but thats not the reason why i'm giving it 3 stars. I guess it could of been worse - could of cut myself witht he one i'm missing.
4,great set! heavy handle,I bought these at a set for my husband...we love the look and quality of the knives. Their blades will cut through food with smooth precision. I searched for quite a while to find an affordable quality knife set and with the one very small exeption of them having heavy handles; they are perfect. If there was some kind of grip or slightly more contoured handle it wouldn't be an issue.
2,not for regular home use,"i purchased this set coz it was among the best seller product,bt it was not upto my expectations as the knives were not that sharp to proven easy to cut all the vegetables.......i returned it to amazon and i must say that amazon proved to be realy good at return policy....."
3,"Quality Knives, High Price, Rust Easily","These knives may be sharp and the block is nice; however, they tend to rust really easily. I wouldn't trust others with handling these knives unless they plan on washing and drying them soon after use. Also, most of the knives are serrated. I would have preferred at least another chopping blade. The steak knives make up the majority of the price, which is disappointing. I bought these knives at the regular price, which I would not recommend, but buying them on sale may make the purchase feel a lot better."
3,Works great but shows rusts after 1 year,Granted I wash these in the dishwasher but what a waste of money. What good is dishwasher safe if they develop rust spots. I think I paid $50 for this set and thought they would last more than a year. The knives cut adequately but the annoying rust spots are a turn off for a nice looking inexpensive set. The black block was a perfect color. Bottom Line = I would not buy the set again.
3,Good set for the money.,"Super fast shipment from Amazon. Good price. Knifes are OK but I noticed that one of them has not very good connection between blade and handle, still works though.otherwise they are sharp enough. Good balance. What else to expect from kitchen knifes :)"
3,Not sharp enough,"I thought they would be sharper..They look real nice, but I doubt that they will never need to be sharpened. I am a bit disappointed."
4,Decent wedding gift,My friend is impressed with the knife set. The wife seems to think the gift wrapping was nice. I've seen them using it so It can't be all bad.
4,Reliable Knives,"Great Knives, feel balanced and sturdy in your hands. The bigger knives seem sharper than the steak knives, but no big deal. The base can also be kind of unstable, but I haven't experienced any problems after setting it up and putting it on a shelf."
3,"Not full tang, but decent knives","Well, you get what you pay for. These are inexpensive knives but they seem to work relatively well. The metal is somewhat thick, but they are sharp. Some of the larger knives have oddly large handles making them less comfortable to use. The knife block has a huge ""GINSU"" metal logo on it, which is something less than attractive, at least to me.These are NOT full tang knives, but for the money I guess I shouldn't have expected them to be. With moderate force on the knife the blade broke out. Ginsu is replacing the knife, but now I feel I need to be more careful with it, which makes me sad.I only hand wash these and expect to own them for a while, but I guess with what I paid for them if they only last a year or three it won't be a huge loss."
4,Nice knife set for the price,I am not a power user of these knives but from limited kitchen duty they have done their job admirably. The knives are pretty sharp and have cut through all kinds of beef pork and chicken with no problem.The steak knives have started to rust on the handles however and the knife block itself has misshapen inlets that sometimes require some force to insert / remove the knives from. Overall for $40 or so this knife set looks good and gets the job done on a budget.
4,Does the job,I have had this for almost 3 years now and am just starting to see the wear and tear on some of the knives. I love this product and would buy again.
2,Shallow Block / Horizontal Slots,"this review is for the SHALLOW BLOCK w/HORIZONTAL SLOTS.I purchased this for my mother on mothers day.the knives do not sit in properly in the block.they are loose and are not even making it look cheap/clunky.very poorly made block.knives are only decent for the price.I do not know how it is for the deep block w/vertical slots.If you want a ginsu knife set, go for this one instead.Ginsu 04817 International Traditions 14-Piece Knife Set with Block, NaturalI own this one and it is much better."
4,Amazing balance and really sharp Edges,Very sharp knives. Absolutely amazing balance to the blades. But prone to stains if not cleaned and dried immediately.
3,Great knives lousy holder,I loved the knives but the case was cracked. I noticed after I unpacked the item and threw away the box. I went online to reorder so I could replace and they were out of stock. So I guess I just will have great knives with nothing to hold them in. Lesson learned: look over your product very closely before you throw away the packing material!
3,"Sharp, look nice, but have rust spots.","They work great, very sharp, and I'm sure they will cut through a can...possibly even a trailer hitch. If only I didn't have to deal with the rust spots. URGH!"
2,Sharp as ever!,"Great knives, very sharp. Really cheap knife holder box, covered in some kind of man made material the was very prone to ripping ~ I went out and bought a proper solid wood one."
2,Rust spots right out of the dishwasher,Knives are sharp and have a great heft to them and feel good in your hand; however the grade of stainless is VERY poor - first time through the dishwasher brought on rust spots.
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad!","I bought a set of knives in the Amazon in the month of April. This one - [...]I have not used the knives because then I was doing a total renovation in my kitchen, something that took 3 months.When I started using the knives, I do not like them because no one had flat wire and this is dangerous. I continued using because I had no other knives. But what was my surprise?I am very disappointed because I've never seen stainless steel knives become rusty. So, are you selling knives for one week only? They are the worst knives I bought in all my life.Made in China!Of course that I no longer have the receipt or the box and I couldn't return to Amazon.I am appalled to see that Amazon or customers (who are these customers?) place 5 stars for this low level of product.I'm very sad because I'm using the worst knives in the world.I would like to put pictures here, but I do not know how to do that.I feel robbed because they overpaid for a product that is not worth $ 1"
1,Where is my order?,"I have never received the product which I ordered. I bought this product with a gift certificate of $40.00 and had to pay $5.32 out of my account. How will I receive my refund of $45.32? Order was supposed to be delivered on January 16, 2009 to 1451 N. Warren, #201, Tucson, AZ 85719"
4,Cuts great,When I opened the package of knives I was disappointed that the Ginsu name plate on the block was loose and fell off. Low expectations began to set in until I actually used the knives. The weight and contour of the knives make them easy to handle and they cut beautifully.
2,Ginzu Knifeset,"I am incredibly disappointed in these. I bought them because it stated they are dishwasher safe. The first time I washed them in the dishwasher they came out ok. The second time I washed them in the dishwasher, they all came out with small rust spots. Very disappointed and will be tossing them since I no longer have the box to send them back in."
2,Damaged Goods,"The knives themselves seem okay but the wood block was chipped. This was a late birthday gift for someone and although they didn't want me to go through the trouble of sending it back, I was still disappointed that it was damaged."
2,Very basic knives. Nothing special,"Thought these ginsu knives would live up to their commercials and be ninja sharp. Wrong! They look nice, and are sleek, but are as sharp as a model I once dated."
3,Better to splurg,"I bought these knives a little over a year ago when I bought my first house. If you NEED a full set of knives and you can live with not-so-sharp knives, because you are not much of a cook then buy these knives. If you do like to cook a lot you are much better off buying a good chef's knife like a Global for $100."
3,"After owning them awhile, a few more thoughts...","1)The magnets pull out of the block. Since the knives are supposedto be stainless they should not be magnetic. But they are.2)They get little rust spots if not dried ultra-carefully aftereach use. Once again: stainless(?).3)The one I use regularly has dulled to the point it wouldn't cutdeep-dish pizza last night. Since these lack ""full-tang construction""pressing down hard with just the handle seems inadvisable. Thus,I extended my index finger on the fat part of the back of the bladefor extra leverage through the crust. The result was a bad cut on my indexfingertip FROM THE BACK OF THE BLADE. No other knife has ever done thisto me and I am quite old. Beware."
4,Glad I bought these knives,"After lots of online comparisons, I bought this set. They are an excellent qualify, cut great, and having six steak knives for the table and prep knives for the kitchen all in one place is very convenient. I like how they look and feel to use. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish the block was stainless as well."
3,major user of cutlery,"The knife set that I purchased was a disappointment. The knives did not fit in it's stand and the knives were not as sharp as I would have hoped. In my right mind, I should have returned them but when I un-packed them, I discarded the stuffings and the original container. I normally do not buy items of this nature unless I physically see them first. I guess it doesn't matter how old you are. There is always a lesson to be learned!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Ehhh, just ok",The knives are pretty but the block was super weird. The slot in the back for the bigger knives were smaller than they should have been so some of the smaller knives had to go in their spots... and one slot in front was just big enough to hold the 'bigger' (more longer than bigger) knife. I couldn't put all my knives in the block. The steak knives rubbed together and scratched... sounded like nails on a chalkboard. I will be returning them. Better luck next time
4,Great Product at a Great Price,"Knifes are sharp. I have compared this purchase to our old knifes and there is no comparison. Cut through meat, cheese and vegetables quickly and with little effort. The performance we have gotten is comparable to ceramic knifes we recently purchased. Bought this set because it was easy to chip the ceramic knifes. I have to wait to see if they never need sharpening. Seems to be an unbelievable claim."
3,Good Knifes that Won't Stand the Test of Time,"I bought these knifes in June, 2008. This is a great, affordable, attractive set of knives. We have always used the dishwasher to clean these. While there is minor rust, it is easily removable with a little elbow grease. After a bit over a year the knifes are still sharp, but we have had some major issues. Several knives have loosened from their handles. The other day I was cutting into something and the handle broke off completely and almost resulted in a trip to the emergency room."
1,They rusted quickly,"Out of the box, they felt like quality knives. I was very disappointed to see that they rusted after about a week of use. After a month one of the knives handles fell apart. They never felt very sharp either."
1,Not worth it...,These knives are just about the worst in quality. They rust at the slightest bit of moisture and TWO of the blades have fallen out...yup...just like that for no good reason. I had initially just ignored the bad reviews because they looked good and some other reviewers insisted that they were good quality. I can honestly say that they are not worth the money.
1,Kniffed,Several blades have come loose from the knife handle set just after approximately 1 year of useage. Supposedly this product had a lifetime warranty-durability. Product is defective.
1,Was not impressed,I bought this item because my old set was at the point where sharpening was not doing any good (never knew you shouldn't put in dishwasher) and needed a good new set. I thought that Ginsu was a good knife brand but they aren't any sharper than the ones I had (could just be this particular set). I was about to check into Amazon's return policy but went past 30 days so just assumed I could not return it. I ended up getting my old set back out again which actully work better even though they are somewhat dull. I will have to look at other sets.
1,"very nice aesthetics, poor construction quality","I bought this knife set back in 2008. I was looking for a black and stainless steel look that would last a while. I do notice that these knives have a tendency to rust more than my previous knife set, but it has not been much of an issue. The big issue with these knives is how the blades are set in the handles. The pictures may make it look like the handles are solid metal, but they are made of black plastic with a metal veneer. This may be expected in this price range, but after 4 years of use most of the blades in the steak knives are loose and I actually had to throw away 2 of the steak knives due to the plastic handles cracking, completely releasing the blades. The larger knives have held up well, but I am concerned that they will not last long also."
4,Real Sharp,"Balance is slightly toward the handle on all of the knives, but acceptable. The blades are incredibly sharp and I can't wait to see how long they remain sharp."
5,Great Value,I purchased the Ginsu Knife Set and I am extremely pleased with my purchase. Not only do they look nice but are very functional. The knives are heavy and very sharp. I put them in the dishwasher and so far no rust stains.
4,Good Knives for the Price,Knives are sharp. Looks very good on black granite countertop. All our appliances are stainless steel and it goes with them too. Overall very good knives for a reasonable price.
3,vickilock,"i love these knives i have went everywhere to find real knives ,i dont need to sharpen them ,they are realy sharp it took awhile to get used to them i was scatred of how sharp they are,as far as the scissors go they didnt last which upset me .i use them alot"
3,Nice starter set.,"I bought these knives because I wanted to get an reasonably priced set to be used when I had company, instead of the really cheap knives that I had for daily use.The Ginsu knives look good, feel heavy, and seem like a nice set. I hand wash these and try to avoid soaking in water for too long to avoid rusting. The knives are heavy and are good for cutting thick vegetables such as potatoes.Three stars because they are not as sharp as I hoped they would be based on other reviews. A sharp knife to me is one that would easily cut through a tomato skin or cut my skin if I accidentally touched the blade. These blade are serrated on both sides, I could run my finger on the edges of the blade and not get any cuts."
4,Amazon purchase,These knives are awesome. Very sharp and look super in my kitchen with the solid stainless steel design.
5,One of my All-time Favs,"I played this board game growing up and we always loved to play it. My mother still has the same MAD MAGAZINE board game with all the pieces and whenever my kids visit her they all ask if they can play it. It is the opposite of most all board games and is alot of fun. Not for the lazy bums though, because there is alot of weird activity involved including switching chairs, tricks, crazy hijinks and charades! I would recomend for anyone with kids."
4,Okay Product,"I got these wipes, as well as a spray bottle of Vinylex and purchased cloth to use it. I had hoped these would do the trick, but they don't cover as much area as I hoped that they would. Not a bad product, but be aware that they won't clean an entire spa cover (which is what I got them for). But still, they will be used when the cover is mostly clean and just needs a touch up."
2,Many pictures of species but lacks proper descriptions,"As it says in the title, this book was meant as a field guide to orchid species indigenous to Thailand. Two hundred sixty-four species are covered, including many obscure genera like Brachycorythis Pelatantheria, and Tainia. More popular genera are also represented (e.g. 63 Dendrobium species). The book is primarily a visual guide that may aid growers in identifying their plants as the text is limited to the Thai name, locality, month of flowering, size and number of flowers. No details on cultivation are given. Readers used to ""Field Guides"" written in the US or Europe will be also disappointed by a lack of specific information regarding how to find any of the orchids illustrated in their native habitat."
4,appreciate the help this book is for U,"You will find this book on every market in Thailand, all the gardeners explaining the English and Thai name to the customers, and the specifics to identify the orchids. Check literature on orchids and you will not find what you are looking for because of thousands of identified and not yet described species. Use this book with marvellous fotos as your field guide, appreciating the work done by Khun Nantiya. For every flower loving traveler to Thailand !"
2,review of frankie ray,the actor Frankie Ray whom played the part of Hoag Was very intresting I beleve He Has gone on and compleated many other films. an up and comming Star. good actor.
5,"Great Practical Book. However, It had missing pages.",This is a great book with practical action items to do as practice. This way I can integrate the priciples given.I discover the following issue with the book and there was no way to report it with the Amazaon.com online system.Missing pages: 56-57-58-59. 75-76-77-78. The web site has a return and replacement process which requires that I pay for shipping the book and no way of knowing if the replacement book will have the same problem. The vendor is Kolowalu Books.Jose.
5,5 Stars here!,"Here is another 5 star movie. I thought the acting was great. Real deep story with lots of truths in it.It had comedy, drama & it will even bring you to tears. To top it off, the ending was very good."
4,"The phase""Off the Beaten Path"" comes to mind...","Excuse the culinary pun., But this movie is gourmet soup The casting,scripts, lights cameras and action all made up the ingredients this great family movie.., I give it a solid ""A""... Between family issues and social environment issues parents today can't always bring their family through to a clear emotional, methodological point a-z safe path thru life., Here is where the father searches himself for those answers where he becomes conscious of his wife's demands to increase his roll as a father..."
5,Outstanding Movie,"Normally I am not a fan of Robert Townsend movies for the simple fact that they are normally stupid and stereotypical. However, this movie was nothing short of Amazing...Townsend stars in the movie as a father that is forced to have to deal with the reality that he is now a widow. His wife Angela Bassett is killed in an auto accident. Townsend is now forced to care for his children alone, his sister Victoria Rowell comes to help. Townsend starts to spiral downward because he loves his wife so much that it is that much harder to deal with the fact that she is gone. So he starts to become angry and bitter and holds a grudge against the driver that ran into his wife. The movie is very emotional and even though Angela Bassett's part was not long due to being killed, the movie does numerous flashbacks and shows her talking to Robert as a ghost. It is a must have and worth then the $8. I dont say that much about a movie but its true in this case."
2,Left me with too many questions,Robert Townsend has ALWAYS been a bad actor!! This movie left me asking too questions like why was the oldest son in the house with the guy who was raping the Lil boy when Robert came to beat him up?? Also what was in the envelope that the white man gave him? Why did the son move away? This movie wasn't detailed enough for me
2,Pathetically boring,"This is the most boring and pathetic ""interpretation"" of the Etudes I've heard in my life. Don't waste your money on it!"
5,A great CD...,"This CD has two songs on it that are not on the US version of this album. I find that ""J'ai besoin d'un chum"" and ""Piaf chanterait du rock"" are well worth the extra 10 or so bucks. The pictures on the album booklet are much better on this one also."
1,Poor quality hose,"I've had this hose on the car for about a year.a) The SS braid is very soft, expands easily and does nothing for overall hose rigidity - I.e: It does not prevent the hose from expansion due to fuel pressure. The braid composition is very flimsy, and is a single layer, unlike higher quality hoses which have a layer almost pressed into the hose and another layer on the outside.b) After about 6 months the supposed ""SS"" braid has started showing signs of rust. That's bad. It means I'll have to replace the hose shortly, as it's no longer is fit for its intended purpose."
5,Great 80's psychedelic,"I own both the original EP and LP on vinyl, the EP is more feedback laden, the LP was, I don't know, more laid back, but w/good dual guitar songs. Both EP and LP appear to be on this CD, so enjoy!"
5,Car physics off But A blast to play,"At first I wasn't really impressed with the game, after all they lowered the center of gravity, increased traction and the handbrake is crap.But get past all that, there are tons of parts and custom options that you will love. Want a 14inch lift on a RAv 4??Online is where it shines and makes it one of my favorite race games and thats saying alot. Vales.com has 600tracks to download. 1000 of vechiles also. You can get a track editor and make your own track like the people at vales.With this aspect this game has an insanely long replay value. 1 hill climb track took me and 2 others 1 1/2 half to complete, it was that long and we had so much trouble completing.Its so fun to go offroading with people online. Bottom line. I can't say enough good things about his great COMMUNITY GAME. Seeya there."
5,great book for any parent,"overall a good book but material is somewhat outdated, good insight for any parent and lets the reader knowwhat to look for and expect in the community..."
5,Great Product!!!!,"After 3 years of using this camera for backpacking in Europe, and living in Spain and going all over the world, plus using it for taking photos for my business website, I can say that this camera has been one of the best that I have had. Its time to buy a new one, but if 3 MP its enough for you and you would use it for traveling this is a great choice!"
4,"Great, Great and Great pictures!!! 2 star customer support","This little camera takes incredibly good pictures, very nice colors and excelent size. functionality is friendly user, and the features are very good. however its sad to say that customer support is not what I expected of Canon, my camera's metal case (2 months old) has started to deteriorate in a great matter. I took it to a cannon representative and they said that Canon would only replace the case but not the camera. considering that this is a new camera and that this is a known quality problem for them I think that they could of done better and replace the unit. if you are considering buying this device take in consideration that Canon has recently discontinued this unit due to quality issues."
3,"Great, till it malfunctioned....","Got this camera in July and love the size and weight of it. Taking pictures was quick and enjoyable and the movie mode has been awesome. Got exactly what I expected from it until.... in late October the camera would no longer focus properly. I've never dropped it and it hasn't been heavily used so I just can't explain what happened to it. When turning the camera on and trying to focus it just gets out of focus regardless of distance to object. This certainly is a warrantee issue, but luckily I didn't have to deal with Canon (who sound very difficult) due to the fact the airlines lost the bag the camera was in."
1,It's the worst camera,"When I received the camera I thought of giving it a 5 star because the good looking and nice picture.After 6 months use, I wish I could give it a 0 star. It's true it looks good but it's very hard to hold the camera. It droped twice when i took pictures. Also the lens is too small. The dirt is very easy to get onto the lens and very hard to clean b/c it's small. Thanks the dirty lens, the picture quality is worse than ever.The battery is very small too. After 6 months use, it can not hold enought power to shoot 10 pictures!They have to put the buttons here and there to fit the small space. It's not a user friendly camera."
3,Ok... I Guess,"After much consulting with my camera expert friend, I bought this camera. And after help from the camera guy in Target. I liked the Movie Mode with sound and picture quality... but I RETURNED THE CAMERA. I did not like how it zoomed. It only had a 2x zoom. I wanted more- so I got more for cheaper!"
1,Terrible quality,"This camera is by far the worst camera i have ever purchased in my entire life! When i bought this camera the pictures that i took turned out to be a diaster. Every thing about this camera is worse than terrible! There is not a bad enough word in the englsih language to describe the bad quality and unrealiblity of this camera! i suggest that if you are intersted in buying this junk, shop around for more choices"
1,Worst camera available,"It's amazing that having the SD200 wich is great, they where able to make such a horrible product.The picures are bad, the unit works unstabel and frezed and the material are bad that makes the metal color go aways soon."
3,overall ok,"I am happy with this camera; however, I would point out a couple of things that might make this a deal-breaker for some:1. I like the date on the front of my photographs. This is only possible w/ this camera if you print your photos at home or use the software to manually add the date on each individual photo. Then you have to save your changes. I have my photos printed at wal-mart, so this is a huge pain.2. The ZoomBrowser software that comes w/ the camera is not too exciting.I think the camera is overall good, but I can't believe they dropped the ball when it comes to the date function."
4,I LOVE THIS CAMERA!,"I JUST RECENTLY BOUGHT THE CANON POWERSHOT SD110...IT IS A WONDERFUL CAMERA. IT IS SO COMPACT, IT COULD FIT IN MY BACK POCKET. I DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LUGGING MY BIG CAMERA AROUND ANYMORE. IT HAS A VIDEO CAMERA ALSO!I WILL CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND THE POWERSHOT SD110!"
3,dead pixels,"I got this camera a couple weeks ago to find out every picture I took had a red dot in it. I think it's due to a dead pixel. I sent it back only to receive another one with the same problem. Now I'm just getting a refund for it. The red dot only comes out on darker pictures and it can be photoshopped easily.The overall quality of this camera is excellent. The colors are very vibrant. It has a strong sturdy feel to it. The battery life is great compared to my last camera. The flash is too bright though, almost blinding. If it wasn't for the dead pixel and the flash this camera would be perfect."
1,Do not Buy this,"I bought this digital camera for $150. But after 3 months of usage, it was malfunctioning with an E18 error. After a research on the Internet it is a common error for all canon products.I used it properly...If you are lucky and do not get this error, then it is a good camera for that price."
1,Don't buy this camera!!,"I have several digital cameras because I like to travel and take pictures. I bought this camera mainly because it is small so I can carry it to wherever I want to. I got it from Amazon in March so it is only like 5 months old. After I bought it, however, I rarely used it because the picture quality is not so impressive. But I keep it anyways. However this afternoon when I tried to take a picture with the SD110, it won't turn on! It simply made some noise and displayed ""E18"" on the screen and powered off. What the? I can't believe this thing stops working after 4 months and maybe 200 pictures?! Avoid this camera!"
2,disappointed by unexpected flaws,"Like many other buyers, I was attracted by its compact cute size and positive reviews (and the clearance price of course). There are two flaws that disappointed me. The silver paint on the camera body started to rub off after two weeks of light use indoor. The flash is very harsh; it makes every light colored surface appear shiny, resulting in over-exposed photos. These flaws (especially the harsh flash) were mentioned by other reviewer here. If I didn't send the UPC for a rebate, I'd have returned the camera. By the way, mine was made in Japan. Don't believe the myth about Japanese manufacturing. Their optics are relative good because they have been in the camera business since the 60s, but the body paint rubbing off in less than two weeks? That's a joke!"
1,"Finish on camera poor, otherwise no problems.","I bought this camera less than 3 months ago and though it is easy and fun to use, the silver finish on the camera body is quickly wearing away on the points where it is held to take photographs. The camera really looks dingy for being just a few months old, and I intend to contact Canon about this flaw. Otherwise it does take nice pictures, and the battery life is outstanding."
1,not a good camera!!,"SD110 NOT A GOOD DIGITAL CAMERA. BETTER YET FIND SOMETHING ELSE. I'VE HAD THIS CAMERA ALMOST A YEAR BUT I JUST SELDOM USE IT BECAUSE THE RESULT OF THE PICTURES ARE VERY DISAPPOINTING. IT IS JUST FINE DOWNLOADING THEM ON THE INTERNET BUT WHEN YOU HAVE IT PRINTED ON THE PAPER, THE PICTURES GET BLURRED. NOW,IM LOOKING FOR ANOTHER DIGICAM THAT WON'T DISAPPOINT ME."
1,It's a RIP OFF!,"Buy Canon SD100 Elph instead and save $50. This is basically the same camera as SD 100 and Canon simply threw in a couple more softwares (which you don't really need) and by changing the body color to white silver, they jacked up the price $50 more. O, yea, and then they named it SD110. How awful is that?! I will get SD100 and use $50 for another SD memory card."
1,Works fine but looks bad,"I buy it on December 15 aprox. Yesterday, Jan 23 I want to use my camera and take some photos... when I see my camera (made of steel or other material non-plastic) it was little oxidized!The camera was stored with original leather Canon Case, and never used before.Think before buying this camera, today it's oxidized from surface, tomorrow from inside components."
3,Outdated & outperformed by current models,"I had this camera for 3 years until I had to send it back to Canon for a manufacturer repair of a known defect at no charge. However, it's past its prime compared to current models that offer 10MP or more, better AiAF,larger LCD screen, more lighting options, and image stabilizer and facial smile recognition. I am therefore buying the Canon SD1200 as a replacement, can't wait!"
3,Blurry,"It's a decent camera for the time it was made, but if you don't take a picture with the flash, or on the surface of the sun, it will not have enough light and will be blurry. I need to find one with more resolution and more sensitivity in normal light conditions."
1,BEWARE,"Okay, I bought this camera 1.5 weeks ago. Received a defective SD110 that had a stuck pixel that showed up on LCD and all photos. Was sent a replacement very quickly, got it - worked for 10 minutes and then completely died. Won't even turn on, lense is stuck in open position. Tried different batteries, everything, it's just plain dead.[...]"
3,...Worked good for about 45 minutes,"The Negative:I liked the camera's user-friendliness and the quality of the photos. However, I only got to use the camera for a total of about 45 minutes. Toward the end of it's life it just shut off by itself. I turned it right back on and just a few minutes later it DIED altogether, leaving the lense open. I tried everything to revive it, including fully recharging the battery but to no avail.It appears I got a camera with the same defect as ""BigDaddyWill"" (his review was on January 9, 2005). Maybe I should have heeded the warning...The Positive:I got a GREAT price on the camera and purchase of the camera made me eligible for a $70.00 rebate on a Canon printer!Amazon's staff were great!. They took my call, heard my story and now my free replacement is on the way (should be here in 4 days), and it looks like the process for returning my defective camera will be a breeze.I trust I have better luck with the next one."
2,Intermediate Gymnastic,This was a gift to my grand daughter who already had one like it so she did not want this one and I returned it. So to be honest I do not know how to rate it.
4,Taraf de Haidouks,"There are two compilations named ""Taraf de Haidouks"" one issued by Cramworld and one by Nonesuch. Both are good. If you must make a choice, the Nonesuch album is the better choice."
1,READ THE WINDOWS XP BOX,Reading the Windows XP box gives you as much information as this book. A total waste of money if you buy it. Office Max gave me one just to get rid of it.
4,Fascinating and intriguing,"I can't believe that I never came across this series of graphic novels. Needless to say, I got my hands on this and devoured it immediately. Adele and the Beast is a bit horror, a bit gangster drama, and a bit adventure. Due to its medium, the full scope of action, horror, and adventure is a bit muted, but the story is very clever and if you are knowledgeable of French history during this time period (1911), very tongue-in-cheek regarding the French government. Luc Besson has adapted this for cinema, and I am eager to see the finished product, as the Adele introduced in the comics is quite the abrasive anti-heroine. I also can't wait for these to be reissued with English translation at the end of this year, as the graphic novel ends rather abruptly, without explaining just who Adele is."
5,Easy instructions for making soft cloth dolls,"I checked this book out of my school library when I was a gradeschooler, kept it out too long and had to pay a fine. As an adult, I found it at a local library and absconded with it and paid for it as if it were lost. I have always loved this book. The author shows how to make cloth dolls in small, medium and large doll sizes. She shows entire families of these dolls and also gives patterns for the clothes. Instructions are so simple, a gradeschooler who knows how to use a sewing machine could follow them."
4,An outstanding gift for any man who has a father.,"Men may grieve differently than women do, and men grieve for their fathers in ways that are unique to them as men and as sons. Seems obvious, but Chethik has written the first book addressing this specific subject. I have shared it with several male friends who lost their fathers at various ages, and all have found it enormously helpful."
3,Too wordy,It seemed it was more detailed than was needed. And some repetition made it harder to keep reading the book.
2,Not for kids,I was searching for something for my grandson who will lose his 39 yr old father soon to cancer. He is 14 and this didn't address the things he needed to hear at this time. It is for adults who lost fathers and review the healing process in hindsight.
2,"Father Loss,...","I, too, lost my father at an early age. I was seeking a book to help as I struggled with his death many years later.I rate this book a ""2"" because it didn't seem to provide the insight or informal counseling that i would have expected in a book, but rather was just a story with several examples of how other folks wrestled with the loss. I couldn't finish the book and have moved on to other books as I wrestle with these issues."
4,Helpful to my teenage son,"Chethik weaves the stories of those he has interviewed with other literary and archival sources, providing a balanced and raw view of how the loss of a father impacts men at different ages. Of all the books I purchased for my son and me since his father died earlier this year, this is the only one that my son actually read. Most of the workbooks and other resource books on grieving are corny, overly-dramatic and frankly somewhat effeminate and did not engage a teenage boy in any way. This one allows some perspective, emotion and a sense that what one is experiencing in grief is not a singular phenomenon.I highly recommend this book as an alternative to the ""touchy-feely"" sector of this market."
4,A Unique Perspective on the Confederacy,"This is a well written book, which is easy to read. The author is a reporter and grandson of a Confederate family that emigrated to Brazil after the civil war. This chapter in post Civil War US history is not well known nor documented. The author provided an excellent and facinating depiction of the southern emigration to Brazil and other parts of Central and South America. As the son of a former Methodist missionary, I thoroughly enjoyed reading about the early influence of southern Confederate settlers in Brazil and their experience. The author is credible and offers a unique perspective on this historical experience."
1,"The Lost Colony of the Confederacy. I,m still lost.....","This book I found poorly written and lacking in the ability to maintain reader interest.While the historical value of the groups or confederate immigration is interesting, it is presented in a form that makes it differcult to get through."
3,"Great Quality, OK fit","The quality on these mats is very high, however when I put them in my 2010 Nissan Sentra the fit was not good on the passengers side. The sides toward the front are propped up because the mat is a bit too big for the car. I wish they had listed the size as not being a perfect fit so I would have known ahead of time. That said I am keeping the mats because the quality is good and I will just make it fit with a little customization."
2,"Marginal fit, nice material",I bought these floor mats for my 2007 toyota prius. since i searched based on the year-make-model i expected a perfect fit but it fits just OK. in particular the driver side has floor clips but the holes do not match up so now i need to either cut another hole in the mat or sit it on top of the clip so that it has a bulge in it
5,very nice art!,"if you've read my review for DNAngel book 1 then you know i love yukiru sugisaki's art very much. she is a very talented artist and i can't wait for more of her work to be translated. brain powered is a very interesting series from the start. the 'mecha' (they aren't machines, they just look like them) are remenicent to the ones in raxephon or the evas in evangelion. i really like the series so far, and i am sure many others feel the same. the art is absolutely stunning!"
5,XMAS PRESENT FOR NEW RIDER,Bought this for my 22 yr old son and even though step father has given a lot of advice this book is just great reenforcement and offers great advice.
2,Better than nothing.,"Spends too much time naming brands and spouting authors beliefs with nothing to back it up. Much better books are available that explain what to do, give tips on things to practice and explain why. So this one is better than nothing, but not worth wasting time on if you actually want to learn to ride better."
2,broken,"We purchased 4 plates. One of them had a large chip on the side. It did come with a 30 day return policy, but I did not have time to check into it. I use the internet for convenience and this did not add to it."
5,NEVER PAY RETAIL!!,"I just got this as a 47 pc set for daily use and love it! course, I'm a blue/white freak fan too...But I got this from Boscov's(.com) as a complete 47 pc set, service for 8, for only $79.99 for the set. (do expect to pay about $40 for shipping - but its still WAY cheaper than buying two sets of four of everything from amazon!)Good luck!"
5,"Well Done Downtempo Worshop - Nice Job, Crowder!","I love DCB, have Illuminate, Can You Hear Us and two Passion albums. As someone who also appreciates downtempo (think Moby, BBC Blue Room, or new wave turning 40), I thought this was fresh, new and still worship-full. I keep this on while working, cleaning the house, driving. Even my Third Day loving wife thinks its great. And the kids...well, they keep coming over to the stereo and turning up. At work, I leant it to our spike-haired, retro-black-glasses-wearing graphic designer and he loved it. Worship music to him had always been 'boring.' This CD is certainly not."
5,Amazing Mix CD,"When I first got the CD and found out that it was just a CD full of remakes of songs that I mostly had on other CDs I felt extremely disappointed. It only took the 30 seconds to pop the CD into my music player to change my mine. The CD is a masterpiece. All of the song are vibrant and alive. If you enjoy any of David Crowders music, you will absolutly love this CD. I would recomend it to anyone."
2,DCB bounces one off the plate,"As much as I hate to say this, I really do not care for this album. It contains remixes of several DCB classics, and I think that all of them fall well short of the originals. In general I am a big DCB fan. I think the band is very creative and has done a wonderful job of bringing their unique sound to the modern Christian music scene. But I think this album was a mistake.I have heard great things about their latest release, so I am hoping for the best. I do not recommend buying this DCB album. Can You Hear Us and Illuminate are much better than this one. I did not realize that it contains only remixes when I bought it. Now I am disappointed that I made that mistake. Better luck next time."
1,DON'T BUY,"I bought this game thinking it would be fun buying and upgrading cars, then racing them. I also thought it would be a cheaper alternative to Need For Speed Underground. Well the upgradings not bad but the racing is terrible. The graphics are so bad. If is fun upgrading your car but thats it. There are also so many bugs and glitches that it is hard to play."
2,Third-Party Pipe,"I sometimes need help from games through strategy guides, but there are some guide the publishers make, that really don't seem to adequately carry on very well. Prima has made a few of them. Their guide to Super Mario Sunshine for the Nintendo Gamecube, really doesn't seem all that helpful. Although the designs as nice and very well put together, it really doesn't coursely enough show the maps and hints in there, to get through certain areas, and to find shines needed to beat Super Mario Sunshine. All in all, it only seems like a must have, if you don't have the original guide from Nintendo. Instead, I absolutely suggest you get the Nintendo Power strategy guide of Super Mario Sunshine. It is a much better guide for that exact same price as the plumber gets the pipes."
4,FUN GUIDE,The GoodLoads of colorful screenshotsNice ChecklistsThe Badnone as i know ofThis guide comes with cool mario sunshine postcards ' and i brought this guide through ebay and i went to look at it ' during playing the video game and finally i beated the game and i couldntve done it without this book so i suggest buying it if youre having trouble with SMSSo buy this book you wont regret it :)
3,Timely manner,"II purchased this product for my wife, but it looked to be in good condition and came in a timely manner."
1,The unorganized,"The book is messy. First, it's impossible to find a blue coin in this stupid guide. They give you crappy hints"
3,Wait a Minute!,"Not bad. Some good songs here. You'd have to be a fanatic to want this, though. The Easybeats were a weird group--a bit like the Kinks and a bit like some vocally challenged combo in a provincial bar in a dusty corner of Australia or North Dakota, circa 1966. They anticipated groups like Family in that the Easybeats would try anything, they didn't really have a style. Their later forays into fake-Motown are truly horrible. So this one does contain a few really classic songs performed not so well. ""Me and My Machine"" is a great car song; ""Wait a Minute"" is a minor classic of a power-pop tune. The title track does the Easybeats trademark ominoso trick quite well, with ridiculous backing vocals. Where is Snowy Fleet now?"
5,A nanny is the MOST IMPORTANT single person you'll ever hire,"Be advised ! Every young parent should read ""The ABCs of Hiring a Nanny"" whether they intend to or not. Right down to the fig newtons and graham crackers, there is a wealth of common sense and parental experience with the reader. Anyone who comes in contact wih children Needs this ""Nanny mannual"". Nanette DeMusey old maid aunt, journalist."
5,Needs Assesment designs a plan,"The needs assessment really gives you an idea of what to look for and what to ask. The forms are great, and the format of the book with a disk to reproduce forms is terrific. The childcare reference form tells you at a glance what you want to know about your prospective's employment experience and history. We saved time by down loading the forms from both IRS and INS. Also if you are looking for an agency out of your area, the web site has a directory(abcnanny.bizland.com)"
4,A fun and challenging book for healthful eating.,"This is not only a cookbook, but an interactive journal. The author offers a 30-day challenge, based on whether you are a beginner, intermediate or expert at healthful eating. You then go through the journal, focusing on a new aspect of healthful eating every day and journaling your progress. So far, most of the recipes I've tried have been wonderful. I took the 30-day challenge, which for me was a meatless diet, and ended up with lots more energy! I'm not going back. I'll try it again soon with another 30-day challenge. Note: there are a few recipes I just couldn't stomach, but perhaps as I get more used to healthful eating I'll appreciate them someday. Definitely a life-changing book!"
2,The day Of tThe Storm,"This is the third R. Pilcher book I have read. I so enjoyed the Shell Seekers and Winter Soltice . I am afraid this book was a let down for me. It has beautiful descriptions of the countryside , which I love. But the book did not pull me into the lives of her characters as the other two books did. I will now try September and hope to have another good read !"
3,Flimsy,"This is a huge map, contains everything, and is good for use in your hotel or at home locating places and routes in Berlin. You'll have to use a smaller map when you're out and about because this one is just too big and cumbersome to use on the street. My main complaint is that it's printed on the thinnest and flimsiest paper, so that it's guaranteed to tear almost immediately on opening, folding, etc. For the price, they should have printed on heavier paper."
2,Good Plot; Needs an Editor,"I had to struggle to keep reading this book. The plot is good, but the writing is so overdone, it was hard to get through. Every utterance is characterized by the author, rather than letting the character's words let us know what's going on with them. People never just ""say"" or ""ask,"" they ""philosophize,"" ""blurt,"" ""snap."" It seems they are all over-caffeinated and under-medicated. It also seems that somewhere along the way, Nussbaum heard of the Ciceronian Triplet. Unfortunately, he didn't learn to use it sparingly. He often ends a sentence with three adjectives to provide emphasis. The effect works once or twice, maybe. Also, the whole ""fate"" theme is a bit heavy handed, but I've never been much into that idea."
3,Book Boy disappoints,"While the story is interesting and well-developed, don't expect high-quality literature from this one. I found the level of writing disappointing, at best."
2,Disappointing,"Rich, good-looking and good-hearted Rick Bradley runs into a homeless boy outside a bookstore in his hometown of Seattle and takes a shine to him, bringing him home, cleaning him up and trying to get him back on his feet. Unexpected consequences arise from his good deed, of course. The plot sounds more interesting than ""The Boy in the Book"" in fact turns out to be--Tom Nussbaum has written and published work before, according to the biography on the jacket, but on the evidence of this effort, still needs a good editor and some review of fiction-writing basics, such as: avoiding telegraphing characters' thoughts and emotions when they can easily be discerned by the reader from the narrative alone, using coincidences and adverbs with a sparing hand, and not using melodramatic incidents such as a man blowing his brains out to re-energize a flagging plot."
2,Not Great,Sorry - I swear I'm not a snob - but I tossed my copy rather than pass it on like I do with most books. I got through it but in my opinion it was rather predictable and childish. I would have been more pleased if I found out the writer was in high school. Try something by Jim Grimsley or Bart Yates if you are looking for a good story and higher quality writing.
2,Chaotic and overly subjective,"I got this because it was free, and I figured, how could you screw up such a riveting story? You get what you don't pay for. It is indeed an example of period-style writing. This would be fine- even endearing- if the author had been a good writer and had some sense of plot flow. Events shared seem to be pulled at random, and without a sense of clear, objective historical accuracy, the reader is left feeling pulled about in many directions, following the author's inconsistent thought process and piecemeal rendition of the story. Buy another text like ""Desperate Passage"" if you want the electric potential of this tale to come shining through."
5,A good read,A very sad story that reveals the length in which some people will go to make a better life for their families. These brave soul's set out to cross unknown territories to reach California and a better life but sadly half of them lost their lives under unimaginable circumstances. Those who tried to reach them to help were also brave.
4,Evokes feeling,"Some people are upset with this book because they feel the author was biased but it would be hard not to be if you knew these people personally.I've read history books that were written with no feeling, and was pleased that this one wasn't full of cardboard facts."
4,The History of The Donner Party,Knowing the area of the Sierra's and Donner Pass is quite helpful in reading the history of this historic journey. It was amazing learning about the true hero's of this event and the fact that there were those who survived this ordeal.
3,Interesting.,"An interesting read, but it seemed to me the author was trying too hard to ""prove"" his point of view. I wasn't necessarily looking for undisputed facts. I just wanted to read about the tragic trip."
4,"History of the Donner Party, a Tragedy of the Sierra","I found it a very worthwhile read. The author (a Donner) was a small girl during the trip. She would see things through her child's eye. I thought it a good defense of the Donner party and a good story. It was amazing how difficult it was to get help to agree to come rescue the party. I had always thought that ""back then"" everybody was a good neighbor willing to jump in and help. I guess not. I would recommend this book."
5,Excellent example of period writing - still gripping!,"The McGlashan book has been in print almost continuously for nearly 120 years. While not the entire story, it is still the book against which all Donner Party stories are measured. It is a compelling story of the classic American tragedy of the western migration, showing the many complex sides of the individuals involved in the story. It is mandatory reading for anyone interested in our western history"
3,"McGlashan's Work Valuable, But Flawed","While certainly a worthwile book on the tragedy of the Donner Party, the book does have its weaknesses. Specifically, McGlashan's research is less than objective. As George Stewart points out in his better book on the subject, ""Ordeal By Hunger,"" McGlashan was very sloppy with his facts. His personal friendship with a few of the Donner Party survivors also biases his writing. Still, the book is a very important read for those interested in this historic tragedy. For the money, though, Stewart's book is the better choice"
1,Difficult to follow,I know the story of the Donner Party and was very anxious to read this book. However it jumped around and was very difficult to follow. I still haven't finished it. I'll save it for whenever I have nothing else to read
3,A writing of its time,"Written in the style of the time i still found this book easy to read but somewhat stilted, like a series of journal entries or a continuing series of articles for a journal. However, it was entertaining, but I felt that there were stories behind the main thread that were not told and i intend to read further accounts of this tale from other perspectives. I did like the final chapter where the author gives a full summary of what happened to all the survivers and their offspring. It seems that the survivers of the Donner party have threaded their way through America's history and shows how important, and integrated, these early pioneers were to the West."
4,Great Recorder,"This is probully one of the best recorders ive used.The Sound Qulity is Great and it is very easy to use. The Only Complaint i would have is that the front pannel design doesnt match my other componets, but other then that its a Great Recorder And At a good price I Highly Recomend it."
1,boring and a total dud,"If anyone is reading this and thinking o maybe i want to buy this it looks fun, well fun is not the word you want to use, how about so BORING, BORING, BORING. This game looks fun on the out side but is so boring when you start to play the game. I mean i almost fell asleep playing it now i know i sould read the feedback befor i decide to buy it! (Trust me, i wasted 20 bucks)"
4,Third Book in Series,"This is the third book in the Dorothy Lyons series that began with Silver Birch and continued with Midnight Moon. In this one, Connie is waiting for her mare, Silver Birch, to give birth to a foal. That foal turns out to be the Palamino colt, which she names Golden Sovereign. The story is about many different things that happen to Connie and her friend Pete and how the two of them raise and train horses, and how they train Golden Sovereign. I like all the Dorothy Lyons horse books and think that most kids who love horses, particularly girls who love horses, will like these books. The books are just a touch ""slow"" in comparison to the Walter Farley books: less exciting things happen. But what happens does matter, and does teach Connie maturity. I think that Golden Sovereign is a bit faster-paced than the first two books."
5,From the Director:,"This is an introduction to Shiatsu Massage to help people learn to massage their friends and family. Jerry Luglio teaches the basic techniques, including pressure points and passive stretching. How to work each area of the body, including face and feet. The camera zeroes in on each technique for ease in viewing as Mr. Luglio explains what he is doing. You can follow along with the tape as you massage someone or learn from the tape first and then massage. Mr. Luglio also explains how to correct some basic posture problems with massage and stretching techniques for the masseur to loosen up before and after the massage. There is a follow up video, Advanced Shiatsu Massage by Mr. Luglio, which delves into locating and using the pressure points and energy meridians. (Also available from Amazon.com)."
1,eehhhh!,I personaly did not enjoy this video. It was hard to focus on the Shiatsu Therapist and the video did not seem well made.
3,Fuzzy Picture Quality,"Along with the fuzzy picture quality, this product really didn't go into the meridians and it didn't give any definition of what Shiatzu is.It was a fine demonstration of the active modality and I will be using his techniques in my massage work."
4,Quick intro to Tiger features,"This book delivers on what it promises - quick and dirty introductions to the new features of Tiger. It does a great job of getting one familiar with all of the new features, though, as noted by other reviewers, it is not intended to be an in depth reference. The chapters on generics and concurrency could certainly be deeper, but the book provides a good grounding in the basics, opens the door to more complete study, and provides enough sample code to get one writing code."
4,Good intro to Java 5,"This book is for you if you have been programming with Java and want a quick intro to the latest version (code named Tiger). All new features are explained in simple language, the author is really not a long-winded type. I recommend this to all Java folks out there."
5,Review of Java 5.0 Tiger: A Developer's Notebook,"Great handbook with lots of useful examples. Cannot replace a thoughtful textbook on Java 5 features. Yet, is highly recommended as reference material for developers with sufficient background."
4,The Best is Yet to Come,"This 4-song EP will only make you more excited to hear the full-length album in 2006.""Ramblin' Man"" is brilliant."
4,This book is as good as it gets!,"This book is good for learning rythm interpretation. The language is simple and straight foward. Unlike many books I have come across, this one is cleanly arrnaged. I was doing my ACLS for the first time and I passed it! Credit goes to this book. I have ordered 10 copies so far for my workmates."
4,Superb sophomore effort from Australia's 60's greats,"For many bands, the second album is one of their weakest. Not so the Easybeats, who had really mastered their version of teen thriller rock by the time of ""It's 2 Easy."" Non-Australians who saw the 1980s film ""Starstruck"" will recognize ""Easy As Can Be."" ""Wedding Ring"" is a classic male adolescent complaint. ""I Can See"" is an ""Easybeats-meet-The Who"" number. ""Sad and Lonely and Blue"" is a pseudo-Eastern drone number (think of the Kinks' ""See My Friends""). All of these tracks are great. In all, a fine solid album. The additional tracks include some alternate mixes from their 1967 album ""Good Friday,"" which do not belong on this disc. However, there is also their classic ""I'll Make You Happy"" which comes from the period of this album and is one of the Easybeats' most exciting singles; check out the way the band really uses its two guitars.You can't go wrong with ""It's 2 Easy"" if you like 1965/66 era rock. Buy it."
3,Pedestrian,"Great artist, great songs, good arrangements, but consideringthe treatments are Jazzy I would have expected more stretched outversions of cuts letting the band do transcend.So, have some wine, get in the kitchen cook pop it on for backround music you'll dig it. My only disappointment is it has some much wasted potential for what it could have been.So, pedestrian jazz."
4,Remaster offers substantial sonic improvement,"Compared to the original CD issue, the remaster shows a noticeable improvement in audio quality (surprisingly, that's not always the case with remasters). The bass, in particular, is much improved. The high frequencies, particularly cymbals, are also much cleaner in the remaster.The remaster does engage in one ""trick"" - it's considerably louder than the original. But after correcting for the difference in levels, the audio quality is still clearly improved. I did my comparison using a Mark Levinson 390S CD player, BAT VK-300SE integrated amp, and Quad 988 speakers."
1,Two out of three is weak.,"My gripe is with Creative and the MuVo Micro which has morphed into the Zen Nano Plus. I bought 3 of these for Christmas gifts, and now, less than 6 mos. later, 2 of the 3 have bit the dust, refusing to stay powered on for more than 5 secs. Useless. No downloads or upgrades helped. The 90 day labor warranty had expired and a $25 fee was required for each unit I wanted to fix...i tried to get them to look at both for $25 (they shared the same problem), and they responded with a this-is-the-warranty, send $50 if you want them fixed, ""have a wonderful day"" e-mail, which i found particularly irritating."
1,"After reading these reviews, I don't feel so bad...","What a piece of junk! After four hours of messing with this thing and at least that many system recoveries, mine is repackaged and ready for return. The ""simple"" drag and drop loading of this turd has locked my computer up more times than I care to recount. The one time I was able to get more than 20 songs onto the thing without having to CTRL + ALT + DEL and start over from scratch, the player itself locked up! I consider myself to be fairly computer literate, but this thing made me feel like a complete and total idiot. I'm so disgusted right now, I'm not even going to waste my time with Creative Labs' customer support (which, by the way, is only open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday). Save yourself the time, trouble and headache and buy something else -- anything else. Aaaaaarrrrrgh!"
2,ANUS RETRIBUTION IS RIGHT,ALTHOUGH THE GREAT BAND CRUACHAN SUPPORT THIS BAND. I FELT IT WAS A REAL DISAPPONTMENT. I DO ENJOY THE CELTIC INFLUENCED LYRICS AND THE SINGERS GROWLY VOICE IS GOOD. THE CLEAR VOCALS RUIN IT FOR ME. I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE DEATH METAL GUYS WHO THINKS CLEAR SINGING IS STUPID INFACT I ENJOY GARMS CLEAR VOICE I ALSO REALLY LIKE VINTERSORGS CLEAR VOICE AS WELL AS FENRIS'S. BUT THE SINGER OF WAYLANDER DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO SING CLEAR.
4,Good investment for a beginner,"The book has several specific tasks for upgrades as well as routine maintenance. The color photos are a plus. The tasks performed are on a Sportster ,I just wished they were done on other bikes as well. But it does put you in the ballpark so you can proceed with a level of confidence. I also wish it was longer."
2,Wanna Be,"I am a motorcycle wrench and I love it . I read whatever I can get my hands on and give credit where credit is due. As mentioned in a previous review , If you went over your motorcycle's service manual , NOT THE OWNERS MANUAL, the service manual you would have more information. Her husband ownes the shop and it is his hands you see covered in grease / dirt not hers. So she takes a a good picture , her husband does the work . Do yourself a favor and pick up "" Fix My Hog"" DVD for your model of Harley davidson . First rate instruction and goes over shop items, tools and procedures ."
1,B-A-S-I-C,"If you can read your owners manual, you'll get much more info than comes with this book. While I'm sure Ms. Liberte knows her way around a motorcycle, this book is so basic as to be borderline useless. The most radical chapter is on changing an air filter. If you're actually interested in working on your bike, most any other Harley book stands head and shoulders above this one. Ive read just about every other Harley book on the market and while other books display passion or at least some vague interest in the subject, this book was just......written. Save your money. Yeah its a female mechanic with Jane Kennedy glasses. Once you're past that, there's nothing."
4,Food for thought,A fascinating background into a variety of high profile cases where children have resorted to murder; from 12 year old Jesse Pomeroy in America in the late nineteenth century to the 10 year olds who killed Jamie Bulger in Liverpool in 1993. Many people just categorise this type of crime as 'evil' and understandably find it hard to come to terms with children who go so far as to kill. However Davis manages to write a factual account of events and leaves judgement to the reader. As well as case studies she includes some very interesting statistics.
1,Cashing In On Current Social Trends,"Yes, Davis lets the crimes speak for themselves. But there is a trend in the USA of trying children as adults and all around demonizing them that this book seems to cash in on, and I find it quite inhumane and distasteful. If there had been any kind of thoughtful analysis it might have mitigated this content, as is I cannot accept it as more than it is: Cashing on on some people's need to be afraid, and giving child haters ballast for passing more hateful laws."
1,Apologist for child murderers,"This author, a non-professional, has bought the abuse excuses of numerous childhood killers who claim they were abused. There is virtually no corroborative evidence and the author is soft in the head about the child killers who claim, with no evidence, that they were repetetively abused. Skip this offering it is not worth the price. The author never knew any of the murderers and falls victim to their most ridiculous claims of abuse. This is a case example which demonstrates why lay people should never write about such murders because they are completely stupid and unprepared to consider the actual evidence."
3,A Children's Culture Reader,"This is an interesting book, but in some chapters it tends to focus more on the historical role of the child than it addresses current social issues that are of concern in our society. Some of the contributing authors also offer highly subjective perspectives on their topics. Some chapters are very relevant and informative. All in all, a mixed experience."
1,SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS,THIS IS THE BIGGEST RIP OFF EVER!!!!!!!!!!!THIS THING CANNOT ADJUST TO ALL BLOW DRYERS!!!!!!!ITS A BIIGGGGG LIEEE!!!!!!!!I JUST WANT MY $10 BACK!!!!!!!!ITS TINY TINY TINY..IT CANNOOT ADJUSTTHIS COMPANY RIPPED ME OFF!!!
5,Some say it's the best collection ...,"... and I'm not about to disagree. It was released on vinyl only in New Zealand, Australia and Japan in 1978. I listened to my vinyl version again a few days ago and on the basis of that was moved to track it down on CD. Mission accomplished! (If you're ever in Auckland, New Zealand, Real Groovy Records is well worth a visit).The version of Spanish is the Loving Tongue on this is superb and I haven't seen it on anything else.Don't buy it for the sleeve notes though!"
4,One for the collector,"God knows I must have some of these tracks umpteen times over, however, 'Masterpieces' gets a thumbs-up from me simply because of the presence of a few otherwise unobtainable, or at least scarce jewels located within. The live versions (from the Isle of Wight, 1970), of 'Like A Rolling Stone' and 'Mighty Quinn' are great, and the 'Big Band' version of the single 'George Jackson' likewise is a rarity. Aside from those tracks, you can't argue with the track selections - like another reviewer says, it was an Aussie / Japanese release at the time (late 70's) to coincide with a Far East tour. I've always liked the Bobster's 'Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window', and 'Mixed Up Confusion' - all good stuff, but, if you can afford it, worth owning, but not if you're looking for a more all-encompassing Dylan comp."
2,Poor Quality Video,"This is a good video documenting some of what Paul McCartney was doing in the lead up to the post 9/11 Concert for New York. I got the blue-ray version and aside from the deliberate black/white ""frosty"" scenes, the video quality of the TV interview scene are not very good. I have the Concert for New York DVD and the video of that DVD set is much better, played on the same Blu-ray player and TV.Aside from the poor video quality, I think the overall show could have been a bit more about what New York was going through a month after 9/11. It came across a bit too much McCartney centric (and I am a long time Beatles/McCartney fan)"
2,Disappointing Mac Doc,Even as a McCartney fan I found this boring. It shows Paul walking the streets of New York showing Himself as a man of the people. Hard to do when you're a celebrity . Even the backstage banter got old fast. Didn't shed any light on 9/11 other than to let us know Paul was there. Buy the concert for N.Y.C. and skip this.
4,God Bless McCartney,"I received this as a Christmas gift and am glad that I was able to watch it end to end 10+ years after the event took place. For those that might not like McCartney you have to acknowledge that he did his best to provide some sort of healing so shortly after 9/11. For a Brit to come up with a quick tune, ""Freedom"", and try to give back to a country that has given him so much I really appreciate it.Hi-lites for me were the snippets of Paul in the street talking to regular people and recognizing his true fans. Also, the classic clip with the fireman stating, ""Osama Bin Laden, you can kiss my white Irish ass!"" Classic!"
4,A fine documentary about the post-9/11 Concert for NYC,"This documentary, made by Albert Maysles ofThe Beatles - The First U.S. Visitfame, is an interesting look at the behind-the-scenes activities leading up toThe Concert For New York Cityin the fall of 2001, after 9/11. A lot has changed in 10 years; Paul was still a widower, and had not yet married golddigger Heather Mills, much less Nancy Shevell (when I saw the moment in the film where Macca meets up with Barbara Walters, little did they know that one day they would be (sort of) in-laws (Shevell is Walters' cousin)). Also, George Harrison was still alive, though not for long (he passed away on November 29, 2001). Paul is interviewed by Dan Rather, Howard Stern, and others along the way, and his interactions with the people on the street are quite entertaining. There are also rehearsals of several songs and some footage from the concert, which is still available on DVD andCD. So if you're a McCartney fan, this is certainly worth having."
2,Blu-ray Disappoints.,"The Blu-ray is really a waste here. Although the stills on back of the box are framed 16:9, the film is 4:3. Also, although it is mostly black and white, it appears that it was shot in color and then changed to black and white electronically, with the color info appearing as noise in the black and white video.The color concert bits and other video excerpts are very low quality, and appear worse than standard definition. These color parts are so blurry that it must be either a technical blunder or a bad 'artistic' choice to differentiate what was shot for this film and the material borrowed from other sources.The program itself is interesting for the Beatles fan, but for the videophile, save your bucks and get the regular DVD instead."
3,A diehard DOA fan,"EEEEK!! Pete, what were you thinking? Although I am a truly devoted and diehard DOA fan, this one had me worried about the band's future. But after a few listens, it started to grow on me. You can't go listening to this cd and expect Pete to scream out ""I thought that you were gone forever, take your chains and take your leather!"" It is a very dramatic change for this group and only the true, open-minded DOA fans will accept it. It is extremely campy, and reminds me of something you would hear in a lounge act, but I do value it's contents. Give it a test spin and you might be pleasantly surprised."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"If your looking for hinrg tunes like other doa cds,you wont find it here!Im glad this cd was not released in america.I think pete is to.The only songs worth buying this for is your sweetness is your weakness,and unhappy birthday.Unhappy b-day you can find on nukleopatra ,a better album.Maybe even the best they have ever released."
4,"Strangeways, Here We Come","Recorded in 1966 and 1967, the music is perhaps the most experimental in the vast discography of Sun Ra. The Arkestra plays stringed instruments - kotos, banjos, ukuleles, koras - with no prior rehearsals.Worlds Approaching is a true ambiance of noise, while a dense soundscape is built upon in Strange Strings and Strange Strange. The later number - Door Squeak - finds Sun Ra ""playing"" a door with a squeaky hinge, while the Arkestra weaves around that sound.The focus is on performance art and the work of artists with unfamiliar instruments to create spontaneous music."
4,part of a small but great tradition,"The first two things that came to mind upon hearing this for the first time recently were Ornette Coleman's ""Skies of America"" and Butch Morris' comprovisations. Imagine that tradition--of free jazz/creative modern musicians using symphonic or large ensemble elements as a palette. Gorgeous, droning, and distinct even in Sun Ra's diverse canon. Recommended."

3,I'm Guilty as Charged.,"Yes, this song is hollow, shameless, and tacky, but ranks high on my list of guilty pleasures. The nondescript album cut gets drastically remixed to a hip hop beat and is set to Ja Rule's growl. It's irresistible and fun, but you may hate yourself in the morning."
4,"J Lo & Ja Rule get ""Real""","This is a really tight jam and I'd be very suprised if you haven't heard it yet. Ja Rule's low & scratchy tone of his voice and J Lo's beautiful higher sounding voice match up perfectly...like Beauty & The beast. The beats and background music are fabulous & this song is also dance-floor friendly as well. No remixing needed. It really deserved the title as ""Hit of the Summer."" Even though there was the whole issue of Tommy Mottola (MAriah Carey's ex husband and CEO of Sony) I still like this song...a lot. Overall Grade for ""I'm Real (Murda Remix w/ Ja Rule)"": A-/B+."
4,Over all a pretty good bike,"The Schwinn Delta Sport is over all a good bike. Here are what I don't like about it. It wasn't packed well, there was a big chip in the paint. The wheels don't ride true. The rear gear cassette wobbled a bit. The front shock doesn't have a full grommet cover. The seat is a little hard. I would have liked plastic pedals, (they are metal.) There is no kickstand. It comes with bottle mounts but no bottle or cage. The front gears have no cover.Here are the things I did like. The suspension design is pretty effecient. I liked the Shimano Acera, and products. Dual suspension is all together more fun and comfortable, but probably not more effecient.In summary I think I was expecting more for $300. But it's a pretty good bike."
4,Happy Dad!,"I bought this for my dad for Father's Day and he LOVED it - said it was high quality and very nice looking. He has been a fan of the Celtics for 40+ years, and was thrilled that I was able to find a Larry Bird shirt."
3,Not what was expected,"In spite of a speedy delivery this item was not what I had expected, it cannot be used with the memory card I wanted to use it with, I suppose more description and specifications are required to better assist the buyer."
1,Can I give it zero stars?,"Pure garbage. Windows did not even recognize it as an actual viable device.Perhaps mine was broken, but at this price it wasnt worth the time to troubleshoot. Given the haphazard sticker placement, low price and the way it didn't work, I assumed it was a counterfeit or reject. You win some , you lose some. This time, we lost."
5,Works very well! Fast and compatible with 4GB!,Does what it says it does. Fast speed and reads a 4GB Sandisk MS Pro Duo and the normal MS Pro. Received wonderfully from Adorama.
3,Typical Car Reader,"This is a typical card reader. It does what it is supposed to do. The cap falls off easily. It does have a loop in it to attach it to a lanyard, but the device itself does not. There is no way the cap would hold onto the reader at the slightest bump, thus making the loop pointless."
3,works but not all that great....,"I am using this with an M2 memory stick which I use with my phone. It is easier and faster to transfer files with this adapter than plugging the phone to the computer.However, the M2 fits on a side slot so it sticks about halfway. Also, the plastic cap that covers the USB connector seems very flimsy and does not seem like it will stay long. Because of these 2 problems I would not want to carry around this adapter in my pocket.I like Sandisk stuff and this reader is functional but this reader seems (to me) to be somewhat clunky."
5,"Funky color, odd design, but workable.","My spouse's laptop did not have a Memory Stick reader and I wanted to buy her aSony Cyber-shot DSC-WX1/B 10MP ""Exmor R"" CMOS Digital Camera with 5x Optical Steady Shot Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-inch LCD (Black). This reader is small enough to fit into the case for the camera and lets you use it on any computer rather than being limited to ones with a card reader. Cheap too."
3,Not that fast!,"I bought this card reader to help speed up transfers on my PSP's Memory Stick Pro Duo, it works but it is not much faster than just using the PSP."
5,Just what i needed!!,"this reads my pro duo card in no time, now i can download my pictures taken with my sony cybershot. don't worry for the low price, does the job!!!"
5,daily with the King,this is great devotional book that can be used with just a few minutes of your time. Evans has a unique perspective on the passages he discusses. this is a must for your quiet time and makes a great gift.
3,Daily with the King - different edition,"This edition has the same content as my old dog-earred copy, but the layout is different and more difficult to read. However, I'd rate the seller as Excellent, with regards to the speed in which it was delivered."
4,"No such thing as ""SUB-conscience""","This is a very good daily devotional. I just have one very big disappointment in it, in that it refers to ""sub-conscience"". That's a man's term which did not come from the Bible nor from God. There is no such thing. There is habit and there is conscience, but the Bible NEVER refers to SUB-sonscience. In man's infinite sinful nature and the want to be God, he thirsts for knowledge which only takes him further from God because any knowledge about our behaviors that's not found in the Bible, is not from God. So take this devotional and be like those of us who like watermelon, eat what's good and spit out the seeds.God bless you <><"
5,bought as a present,perfect for you Abbot and Costello fan. Bought this for my dad for his birthday and him being a fan loved it.
4,Comedy,This is a classic comedy that absolutely is one of a kind. Abbott and Costello are truly a one of a kind comedy pair.
1,Who's on First from Sterling Entertainment Group,"The content is great, but the poor quality is a distraction to this fine content. I know this is an old film, but the quality of the audio is awful....a constant hiss and static. Also the program is recorded on EP...they've jammed 104 minutes on a very short tape, so the video image is at its worst. I hope to find this classic from a better distributor. Don't buy this - you'll be frustrated."
1,Sound quality very poor,"I heartily agree with the other reviewer: the sound quality really detracts from the enjoyment of the material. I couldn't find another source, so I bought this anyway. The Hall of Fame in Cooperstown has a very clear sounding tape, but they don't sell it in their gift shop."
4,Funny clips from their TV show,"This tape is of an Abbott and Costello TV show. It is a collection of famous skits and musical numbers, like a variety show. Interestingly, it also includes the commercials! My 11-year old son is discovering the old comedians for himself and is enjoying the classics, like the Marx Brothers, Abbott and Costello, Charlie Chaplin, and the Stooges. Highly recommended for those who enjoy the classics."
1,Crossing Paths,I considered it very elementary and definitely incomplete It just barely touched on the lines in the hand. I considered it a complete waste of money.
3,Nice cups but handles bend,"These are very sturdy measuring cups and I bought them because of the comfort grip handles. However, if you're scooping anything with the least bit of resistance,like brown sugar, the cup handles will bend. They can be bent back, but I worry that this will compromise the integrity of the handle over time. The most annoying thing about this set is that the capacity of each cup seems to be a decal on each handle and after a few washings, the labels chip off. This can make it difficult to figure out which cup is the 1/3 if you'r grabbing for it quickly."
2,You get what you pay for.,The handles on these measuring cups bend easily if you are scooping things out of bags. The measurements rubbed off of the handles after the second washing so I had to guess which one is which when I was making something.
3,Handles bend easily...,"I'm a big OXO fanboy, however these cups just don't measure up for me. I'm a relative newcomer to the cooking and baking scene, but I would consider them ""light duty"". Handles bend super easy when doing tasks such as digging flour out of a bag and the capacity decals are wearing off. The stainless finish does look good. I'd prefer a heavier cup design with a sturdy handle and etched/stamped capacities...but that will cost more than 13 bucks."
1,Columbian manufactured versions inferior to British!,"For those of you trying to find replacement pieces to the Finlandia pattern, keep in mind that Churchill recently moved the manufacture of this pattern to Columbia. The Columbian made pieces are inferior--the colors are not as clear, the transfers are blurry, and the finish tends to pit. If you want quality, buy the British made pieces only."
5,Remake of Argentinian Film 'Nine Queens',"I haven't had the chance to see the movie yet but in response to the other review, it was not originally made my Hollywood. 'Criminal' is a remake of the Argentinian film 'Nine Queens'. If you want to see one of the best suspense/comedies of all time, i recommend 'Nine Queens'. It's in the vein of Usual Suspects, The Sting, and other films of that type. But better."
2,Decent movie with a REALLY bad ending,"This movie is reasonably well written, directed, and acted for 90% of the movie ... until the ""big twist"" at the end which makes absolutely no sense, is unbelievable, and ruins the picture. I'm sorry I wasted my time watching this."
2,A little hint for folks,"I watched this movie because it had Reilly in it. He's great, as proved by his work with PT Anderson. I also saw Soderbergh's part in it; I loved his Solaris.But this film, which promised a 'suprise' ending, is incredibly predictable. Just remember the ""Usual Suspects"" rule (another film that people rave about the 'suprise' ending which I saw a mile away); the least likely suspect is THE person in question. That way the writer, who is not that talented, thinks he/she is talented, because you see, they INVERTED what was expected. Of course, they are only capable of this simple reversal of formula, not with anything truly original.The film's endings is stupid beyond belief: ask yourself, did all those folks do this for such menial cuts? And did you not see this coming? Come on!"
3,Matchstick Criminals,"If you saw ""Matchstick Men"" you would guess how this movie will end!, Why does Hollywood insist of making/releasing many movies with almost the same feeling?!not a bad movie, but enough to avoid buying, so...RENT!"
4,NOT SEEING THIS FILM SHOULD BE............CRIMINAL!,"This is a very good film with some terrific performances and an interesting story. It's about time I saw a movie that totally blind sided me and I was completely baffled to the very end. It's short and to the point, but it doesn't feel rushed for being under an hour and a half. One of the better unknown movies I've seen in a while. It's well worth checking out!"
3,"familiar story, good twists","Criminal 3/5This film is a remake of the 2002 film Nine Queens by Argentinean director Fabian Bielinsky and it is similar to the 2003 Ridley Scott film, Matchstick Men.John C. Reilly (Chicago, Gangs of New York, The Aviator) plays a conman who chances upon a young conman in a hotel casino. Under the guise of being a police officer, Reilly's character arrests the young man and offers him a chance to work together. The young man accepts. They spend the day learning trying out new schemes.The acting is well done by everyone. The story is familiar, so there is no knockout surprise, unless you were totally taken in by the script. You're on the lookout for a double cross, but just when you think you know what it is, you realize that there's another twist and turn to the film. Too bad there were less than 20 people in the theatre to see this otherwise entertaining film."
1,More of the same,"It is what most astute and unbiased analysts of the Caucasus have come to expect from Cornell, pro-Azeri 'facts' and half-truths given to him by his financiers in Baku. This is worth reading only to contrast it with the works of serious scholars like de Waal."
4,Impartial view on the Caspian Region,"It is thorough and impartial review of events occured in the Caspian region. It highlights many problems which remained obscure due to the dominant view on the regional conflicts from Armenian perspective. The author draws attention to the role of regional powers, particularly, Russia in the Caucasus.The author frequently visited the region and is aware of matters."
1,INCREDULOUS STANK!,"FIRST OFF DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE AVERAGED 2 STARS.....THIS FILM (ALTHOUGH NOT WORTHY OF THE WORD) GIVES REASON FOR AMAZON TO RE-VISIT THE RATING SCALE THEY USE. THIS FILM DOES NOT EVEN MERIT A SINGLE ARM OF A STAR. IT IS BYYYYYY FAAAAAAAAAAR THE SINGLE WORST WESTERN I'VE SEEN HANDS DOWN AND DEFINITELY IN THE RUNNING FOR WORST MOVIE OF ANNNNNY KIND I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!! GIVING KILMER CREDIT, I BET HE WAS EDITED BACK INTO THE FILM DEMANDING HE BE DEAD THE ENTIRE TIME BECAUSE HE PROBABLY REALIZED WHAT A PIECE OF TRASH IT WAS AFTER IT WAS TOO LATE. FOR PEOPLE TO THINK OF THIS FILM AS ""ARTISITC FILMMAKING"" IS SO LAUGHABLE. ENOUGH SAID I'VE WASTED 2 MINUTES OF MY LIFE ALREADY ON THIS."
1,This movie is DEAD.,The acting and the plot are really bad. What is Val Kilmer doing in this movie?It's a huge waste of time and money.
1,"If this is an Homage to the Spaghetti Western, then there's Something's Wrong with the Sauce","Hoo boy. Hardly worth the one star. I had the misfortune of seeing this one in the theater, believe it or not. Luckily, that theater was located in the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (and MoMA, I still love ya' - despite your decision to display this flick), and a friend of mine was a museum member. That meant I got in for free, thank goodness - because if I'd paid money for this dreck I'd have been batting down the box-office door and asking for a refund. Now, I know this flick is supposed to be an art piece - an homage to and satire of the Spaghetti Western - but *only* because the museum literature said so. Characters come and go with laughable dialogue and little motivation, while scenes often play out with what seem to be missing transitions.And oh, yeah - Val Kilmer's in this one too. But like these two final sentences, his presence kinda feels like an afterthought."
1,Did Val Kilmer Lose a Bet?,"Apparently, you can't rate a movie zero stars. In light of this film, Amazon should reconsider that policy.In my nearly-50 years, I have watched tens of thousands of movies. And yet I can't think of one that stunk as badly as this picture. The makers of this film try to pass off as ""artsy"" a film that has no plot, asinine dialogue, thoroughly detestable characters and an unredeemed attraction to gore and ugliness. Val Kilmer should be shot for real for lending his name and photo to this picture. Comparisons to Eastwood's spaghetti westerns are ludicrous.Just poke yourself int the eye. You'll save a dollar and have essentially the same experience."
1,Live bullets should have been used,"I will keep it short: They likened this to the ""Good, the bad and the ugly"". What a deadly way to con viewers. Dead man's bounty is beyond dead, it is totally rotten. Bloody gore without meaning!"
1,First movie I have ever destroyed after viewing.,I`m a hardy individual. This film made me fill dirty! It`s a crime to refer to this as a western. EURO TRASH with a .45.
1,Dead Man's movie?,"I love westerns....love Val Kilmer, but can't really recommend this movie unless you like kind of strange, slow moving (not much real action) westerns. Also, the cast seems to be foreign... definitely didn't come across as an American western to me...isn't that what western's are supposed to be?! Anyway, if you have plenty of spare time and absolutely nothing else to do..."
1,go nowhere movie???,"lots of blood and lots of wasted time didn't make any sense, I wished I had wasted my time and money on something entertaining."
5,Take off Hosers!!!,"Take off from work and go buy this incredible set!! Oh how long I have waited to savor the comedy genius of this series once more! The humor has stuck with me like skillet fried oatmeal over the years, but as my memory fades I can only salivate at the thought of visiting the good citizens of Melonville again! Everything I learned about government efficiency, I learned from Mayor Shanks. Everything I know about finances and securing my retirement, I learned from Brian Johns. Everything I know about relationships and love I learned from Bill Needle and Dr. Kinsey......hmmm...maybe that's why I'm an utter failure. Oh well, there is no failure here, this is priceless comedy, and the fact that it's out has made me giddy as a schoolgirl. Enjoy!"
4,3-D House of Laughs,"I knocked off a star for its user unfriendly menu. Unlike later volumes which tell you what is on each episode, this just has listing like ""Episode 6"" or ""Chapter 3"" on the onscreen menu.That's a moot point though as there is so many classic SCTV bits on here, you'll be rolling on the floor in pain from the laughter. The Johnny LaRue stuff I thought would date itself but that John Candy laugh just slays me every time. From 3-D House of Stewardesses to Angus Crock via Poochare and Brooke Shields (as played by Catherine O'Hara) doing the Devo tune ""Whip It,"" this is comedy gold.The extras are nothing really to write home about and I'd like to see this rereleased with a more informative onscreen menu so you can scoot through and pick your fave bits to replay."
3,SCTV hasn't aged well,"I was around 12 or 13 was originally aired. I remember thinking it could sometimes be funnier than SNL and sometimes fall flat. (I never got the appeal of the Great White North stuff). Uneven, but generally very worth watching, because you never knew when something great was going to come along. I was eager to buy this box and bought it as soon as it was available. Unfortunately, I just didn't find myself laughing much. Aside from some concepts not being as funny as I remembered, it seems a lot of the material had references current to its time. My wife is 5 years younger than me and needed a lot of pop culture, current event references, and bits of satire explained. And as the saying goes, if you have to explain a joke, it's not funny. In fairness though, the actors themselves are all great and are very likable. I found myself rooting for them to be more funny!"
2,A lot of weak humor in this DVD collection,"I have seen 4 of the 5 DVDs, and I have to agree with those who give this 2 stars. Most of it just isn't very funny -weak sketches, mostly. A few sketches on the first DVD are very good, and I enjoyed the interviews. I have also bought some of the later seasons, so Í'm looking forward to seeing them. (I'd suggest buying a good used set of this, or renting it, if that's possible.)"
2,very disappointing,"This set contains a few of the classic skits but my guess is that the funny stuff was done earlier in Canada. There is no Dr Tongue or Scmhenges (SP) Polka show. If you're looking for some of the earlier ""no sell out"" stuff you won't find it here. NBC crushed them.wwhat we need is ""the Last Polka"" on DVDbuyer beware"
5,Finally,"If you love SCTV, and there are a lot of us out there, this is a must have. I'm sorry to say that I've forgotten just how funny the cast and the characters they created were. The first nine episodes of the 90 minute show that aired at 12:30 on Friday nights are included here and the stuff is largely unaffected by the passage of time. To think the show was cancelled so that they could put on Friday night music videos...oh well, at least they've been digitized. If you've never seen the show, and you like to laugh...order this volume, you won't regret it. It's one of the most underrated comedy shows ever made. There's also a bonus called remembering SCTV with cast members that shows how the chemistry contributed to the creativity."
4,SCTV--Ahead of Its Time,"Having moved to Canada when I was ten in 1975, I saw the original SCTV on Global Television. Needless to say, it was a bit over my head when I was 10 or eleven years old. Later, it was reincarted via NBC (from which this volume is taken from). There are a few skits that don't hold up really well, but many of them are hysterical. SCTV was satire at its best, and at times, well exceeded the standard that was established by SNL, although it is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. The set is pricey, but worth it."
3,Are we paying for Johnny LaRue's new crane?,"This isn't so much a review as a complaint. Yes, I agree that SCTV in its prime was one of the funniest shows ever (and these episodes are easily funnier than the earlier Harold Ramis ones). However, how can the studio justify $63 for it? Most other ""Complete Season"" DVD packages are half that price. The episodes themselves deserve 5 stars, but for this price gouging, I have to deduct 2 stars. I am peeved because I would LOVE having this set, but my principles won't allow me to be suckered into overpaying. I guess I'll just rent it frequently from Netflix. [Another complaint: for $63, they should have been able to acquire the rights to the original songs in the sketches (there will be quite a few edits/changes for this DVD because of lack of rights).]"
2,this isnt the show i remember from the 70's,i bought this cause i thought this was the old stuff w/ ramis but its the stupid crap from the 80's and is not funny except for one or two johnny larue skits.
4,Don't throw your TV set out the window!,"I'm glad to see SCTV finally out on DVD but why this season? The NBC stuff just wasn't as funny as their earlier shows. I guess it's because these are the episodes that are most familiar to American audiences but the show went from the core members in the early days writing a lot of funny, original stuff to having a bunch of writers and the comedy being stretched thinner over the 90 minute long episodes appearing each week. There is still a lot of great moments but the NBC run was really the lowest. That being said, I'm looking forward to rhe rest of the DVD releases, I might not buy them all but I still want to support them in the hopes of releasing the funny and original first season and strange, quirky last season of the non-NBC series, both of which contain the best content."
4,Nice history,Informative. It definitely appeals to my nerdish appetite for another big historical picture of a subject that interests me very much.
1,Unexpected,This is a book strictly about the history of paper making. The description of the book did not lead me to think the content was what it was.
1,Look for ideas in other books,"I like many of the books in the Ideas for Great series. However, I was disappointed with this one. The photos are only so-so. They are not very inspiring, and the bathrooms are limited in style choices. The tips also left something to be desired. They were not very substantive or informative. I would skip this book. If you want a bathroom book with great photos, take a look at House Beautiful Bathrooms."
1,A nice picture book but not realistic,"This book only shows enormous homes with tons of space. I'm a city dweller and can't see how this book can accommodate a (average to small) sized city bungalow, townhouse or condominium. Most of the homes displayed are these huge newer homes. If you're tight on space and want to re-do your bathroom, this book will just confuse you with unrealistic ideas."
4,Behind the Scenes,"As someone who journeyed down a path similar to that of C.S. Lewis, I've always been intrigued by his conversion. 'From the Library of C.S. Lewis' gives the reader a behind the scenes look into the works that effected Mr. Lewis' unbelief. This book is an enjoyable read with most of the excerpts making up only a page or two. This can be read in one sitting or as a book that one can go to reference as they go throughout the week.I would definitely suggest this book to anyone who is inspired by the writings of C.S. Lewis. The insight gleaned throughout this book is incomparable. A must-read for any Apologetics student! It will certainly get you thinking as you read excerpts from all different sources from across the spectrum of theology."
3,A look behind the mind,"In the book From the Library of C.S. Lewis, the authors compiled multiple short selections of poetry, literature, and writings all of which inspired and influenced C.S. Lewis himself. As a Lewis and literature fan, I found the compilation intruiging and interesting. Although it's written as a non-fiction treasury, I would expect that most would find it appealing as a reference book or casual read that gets picked up here or there. There are excerpts from Andrew Murray, George MacDonald, Saint Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Wordsworth, Aristotle; not to mention many more. This is a great read for anyone who is a Lewis fan and is interested in knowing more of what went into some of the best works of literature.Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book from Waterbrook Multnomah in exchange for my honest review."
4,Great gift for crossword puzzlers.,"My mom is a habitual crossword player, and this turned out to be the perfect gift for her.This book is an amazing collection of unusual words including their definition, pronunciation and use in a sentence. It's like the author took a dictionary, removed all the words you already know, and left only those odd words you never knew existed. Great stuff and very handy."
3,Words You'll Never Use,"This book is pretty cool, although many of these words will never come out of your mouth in everyday conversation...example: ""The MISOMUSIST (one who hates learning) feels humiliated by the existance of something that is beyond him, and he hates it..."" I still enjoyed reading through all the crazy words and definitions."
5,Bibliophiles Dictionary by Miles Westley,"I highly recommend this book for all types of writers. This book is full of interesting and uncommon words from unusual sources. It may be a dictionary, but it makes for a pretty compelling read on its own!!! I love this book, and I can't wait for the sequel. I read it every morning when I wake up and a bit at night before I go to bed. I CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!!!"
4,Cute - and you can rotate the camera!,"I read a lot of camera comments, but no one ever seemed to google the game name to find this: http://www.valusoftsupport.com/KBArticle.asp?kbid=4874You can rotate the camera, it's just an odd method - click the mouse scroller (if you have one) and move the mouse, strange but true ;)I think it's fun, and I'm an avid gamer, nice change of pace."
3,Prison Tycoon overall fair,I like the game but it is not as fun or exciting as the description said. Overall though it is a good game.
1,Why Bother Selling This One!!!!,"I totally agree with the guy before me! This was awful. I think the one part that bugs me the most is you can't rotate the camera angles. That is really irritating because it seems like you need to during game play!! Very boring game, and the graphics could be better...I Don't Recommend This Game!!!!!!"
2,Waaaay too slow,"Contrary to the other reviewers, I don't find the game graphics too bad. Nor are the controls terrible. However, once you get the hang of it, NOTHING HAPPENS.The whole point is that you build and operate a prison. Good concept. The options for buildings are good, and it is fairly easy to get control. But you run out of building space reasonably quickly. So, you can't add buildings, you can't move on, you're just stuck making tremendous profits and changing nothing. Becomes terribly repetitive, you keep praying for ANYTHING to change -- more land, a riot, anything!Anyway, good concept, decent game, but changes too slowly."
1,Long and drawn out!,"Well, first of all, I have to give this game a VERY low rating, because it seems to ME, you have to use the money cheat JUST TO GET STARTED in the game. Otherwise, you will wind up not even having enough money to house the inmates.Secondly, all this game consists of is pretty much waiting for the next parole period to come up so you can decide who stays, and who gets out (based on length of time inmate has been there, how many rehabilitation projects he's completed, how many fights he's been in, and what, if any, gang affiliations he has). There's really nothing you can do about the fighting that goes on in this game between inmates. I have yet to see a guard break up a fight. So to me this game is just long and boring.The graphics, in my opinion, ARE kinda cute, but not $20 worth."
2,Incomplete and cheaply constructed,"This does not work by itself - the charging cord is a separate purchase. This base is way overpriced especially considering that such an essential piece is missing. The plastic is flimsy. The battery rests on top of the unit and doesn't lock into place, so it's easy to knock the battery out of position. Despite these flaws and ridiculous price I still had to get one to keep the second battery charged, otherwise it's not good to store the spare battery uncharged because then it won't last as long."
1,Battery Killer - Don't Buy,"This charger is awful! Not only does it not charge the battery but it actually destroys them. I had two Scooba batteries, both quite new, both charged fine using the Scooba itself as a charger. I wanted to be able to have one on the charger to switch them out and do a larger area all at once so I purchased this item. I charged both batteries once with this charger and both have completely died and will not run the machine longer than 5 minutes. I switched back to using the Scooba as a charger and neither battery will charge that way either. I have to replace both.Horrible product!"
4,Very important item for apartments larger than 40 sq.m (cycle of standard battery),"With Scooba that does not charge automatically by returning to the base, this charging base very important item for apartments larger than 40 sq.m (cycle of standard battery). You can start Scooba several times on two batteries to clean up whole apartment in one go instead of waiting for couple of hours before your single battery re-charges."
1,Not Good.,"Second one I mail ordered while looking for a good price and, just like the first one, it did not work either. It is a genuine iRobot product. Finally had to order one directly from iRobot and it works great."
5,Just can't get enough of Peter Blood?,"Not so much the return of the Captain, darlin', but his ""overlooked"" adventures in Sabatini's first book, begining shortly after his escape from slavery. Contains all the clever tricks and swashbuckling you've come to expect in a series of short stories. Sabatini's talent really shines in this format and _Captain Blood Returns_ is entertaining to read all at once or bits at a time."
4,THIS IS THE ONE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE DANCE MUSIC.,"........... I LISTEN TO ALL KINDS OF MUSIC AND THIS IS ONE THAT I LIKE. SO IF YOU LIKE ROCK MUSIC AND DANCE MUSIC, THEN THIS IS THE ONE."
5,"What a soul-stirring, peace-giving, inviting voice!","I am a new convert to the troupe of Mary Black fans! Her music was playing the day my friend died and I was moved to tears within seconds. I love Celtic music and Mary Black brings new and fresh tunes and lyrics to the genre. You will not be disappointed, I cannot see how anyone could! Her voice will melt your heart as well as your troubles!"
1,disappointing,"She sold out. She doesn't even sound Irish anymore, I think she is trying to be Celine Dion or something.I love her earlier work, which was a huge on influence on my singing style. What a bummer."
2,OK for larger players,"This is an ok case. Hard to get it secured to headrest in my Chevy Equinox. Straps too big to go around just one head rest and too small to span between the two. Works well as a carrying case for DVD player, head phones and a few DVD's."
1,Product delivered without strap!,"I purchased this product for one reason: it has a multi-position strap. When I opened the package, I realized I never got it. I bought it so I could travel across the country with a dvd player but now I have to go and find something else last minute. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED."
2,No idea how to install,"The product came with no instructions on how to install it in the car, just the picture shown in the ad. I tried to copy the picture and I got it to stay on the headrest but I don't think it was right and it swayed back and forth all over the place. I'm sure it's easy to install with instructions but without, who knows...."
2,Cannot get this thing to adjust to my seat in the car...,"Although the concept is great, I cannot get this thing to adjust to hang from one seat of the car as it appears in the photo advertised. The straps are WAY TOO LONG and it will not sit up correctly. I had to go back to using my former stand."
2,Not suitable for every vehicle,"Nice sturdy case with many compartments. A bit big for my portable DVD player. Did not fit well against the headrest in my Honda Pilot and the base projected out pretty far. Not a good fit if using infront of a carseat. Therefore, I do not get to use this product for its intended purchase as a portable DVD holder. It sits collecting dust in my garage."
2,JB,"After some duct tape and a lot of moving stuff around, I made it work. I have a small SUV and had to move the seat forward and recline the seat forward so my toddler could see the screen and not able to take the player out of the case. If you own a large SUV then I don't see my issue being a problem for you."
3,Average,"Bought it because I thought it would be perfect for long car rides and such but even when you have it tghten all the way it is still a bit lose. Also, my son, who is two just had to kick it once and it would completely come undone. It worked well until my son got either too happy or mad then I found myself having to pull over to fix it."
3,Functions ok but limited adjustment options,"Maybe it was me or my headrests but we have owned this for a couple years and used on several trips. Each time it tends to sag and is difficult to keep level. Also, it takes some time to setup and remove not really convenient. I have not used other products but seems like it could be designed better. On the plus side, it was cost effective, does work (with some effort), and has some nice functional pockets for storing everything. Overall I would say it is a good product but better straps would push it to four stars (maybe five)."
2,"NetBook size, not DVD size","This case is about 2 inches too long and 2 inches too wide for my 9"" DVD player. The paperwork that came with it says that it is a case for a NetBook or DVD player. It may be perfect for a NetBook or a 10"" DVD, but my DVD player is very loose in there, and I don't want a bigger case than needed. I use the DVD player for flying, and wanted the case to fit inside my carry-on, not for it to be another carry-on."
2,too bulky,This is okay between the front seats but way too bulky to be placed on one headrest. The straps work but would be better a little shorter.
4,Great idea,"I really like the idea of this DVD travel holder. I love the bright blue interior. It has great storage for cords and remotes. It doesn't attached to small, skinny headrests that well (e.g. PT Cruiser back seat headrests), so I had to wrap the straps around the headrest a couple times to get it to stay and for the player to be at the right height for my child. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase."
2,Big and bulky,This case was a waste for me. I wanted something to hang the DVD player with so both my girls could see it in the car so I bought this and it didn't work at all! First off I couldn't even adjust it to hand correctly then once I was able to get it to stay it was bPretty much in my daughters lap. Waste of my time and money.
1,Broke 1st Use!,"Bought this for a long car ride with my 2 young boys. Both clips, on both sides broke the first time my husband went to install it. He rigged it with the remaining clips, but the case kept wanting to close shut, and my older son kept complaining he couldn't see. The case was nice, but with the broken clips, it was frustratingly useless."
1,Not satisfied at all!!!,Im not satisfied with this product at all. It will not stay strapped to my seat which is the whole reason I bought one. My son gets tired of holding it and I thought this would work. Sadly it was a huge waste of money! I would not recommend this if that's what your wanting!
3,Couldn't Use like we wanted,"In the picture of the between two seats, it was level. However, we bought this for my granddaughter, who was going on a long road trip across the country, and we couldn't get it level at all. We tried numerous times and gave up as it didn't seem to work for her and she had to just hold the DVD player on her lap, which at 3 years old wasn't a good idea. Good idea but needs some more adjustments, somehow."
2,Not for cars,This held the dvd player okay but this was definitely not meant for cars. It seems like it is made for larger SUV's. No matter what I did it didn't hang right in either of our cars.
5,GREAT!,"This was very helpful on vacation. The case attached to the back of the seat, so my son would not drop the player or have it on his lap. I was afraid he would fall asleep and it would fall or the battery would get too hot to sit on his lap. Plus, this way he was looking at eye-level instead of straining his neck and looking down. It was also cheaper than other models like this, and it was simple to attach. Not a lot of room for extras, but we just put those in his travel bag."
5,Handy and a money saver!,We recently purchased this for our kids for a road trip. What a lifesaver! A money saver too! We only had to purchase ONE dvd player and hang it up behind and between the front seats and all 3 kids could watch it at the same time. We bought the Belkin headphone splitter for $3.50 so we could plug 3 headphones in. It takes a few minutes to fiddle with the straps so you can get the right height and placement but once you get it you are good to go! Would recommend this to everyone!!
3,Just OK,"This case is nicely padded and seems to be of good quality, but I think a few improvements would make this a great case.Pros: Quality, decent dvd storage area, fits nicely between the car seats, has good carrying handle, nice storage compartments, good price, and the kids love the idea of watching dvds in the car now.Cons: The securing straps are way too long and cause instability (I need them to be a little shorter, but there is no adjustment in only out), the inside color is really obnoxious (why not black or gray?), should have a little hole in the bottom for the power cord to snake through, bottom dvd storage area has one zipper where two would be appropriate for easier access, my 7"" player is way too small inside the case (probably great size for a 9""-10"" player), and it would be nice if it could attach to the center counsel."
2,Much too big!,This case is much larger than described. The interior is actualy 11.5 x 9.5 inches. The exterior is 12.75 x 10.75 x 4.5 inches. Why buy a small DVD player only to carry it around in a big case? It's much too large for my Sony DVP-FX930. I'm sending it back ASAP.
1,Waste of $,This item is terrible. It doesn't connect snugly. Our son kicks it in the car & has no trouble reaching it w/ his feet (he's only 16 months old).
1,Not worth the money.,The straps are too long to make it sit at a good height for my daughter to see it. She is in a car seat and the thing is at her feet so that she can kick the DVD player. We drive a Rav 4 that has a lot of leg room in the back so i couldn't imagine using it in a smaller car. We removed the the straps altogether and have been using a zip tie to secure it to the headrest higher up. We have read and reread the directions to see what we were doing wrong. This still didn't help. We would have returned it however we needed it for the trip to Florida and didn't have the time to pick something else up. I am really disappointed with this product. It seems that it would only be good for a storage bag for a portable DVD player and its accessories.
1,!!!,"NEVER EVEN GOT THE DVD PLAYER JUST THE DAMN CASEEEEEEE SO I SENT IT BACK AND GOT MY REFUND , WHICH SUCKS CAUSE I WANTED IT FOR MY BABY BRO!"
1,keep looking,"This dvd player case was too expensive for what you get. Just another junk product from China, that has been ridiculously marked up to sell here. The case does not accommodate the dvd accessories. It does not conform to the car seat back, and wrestling with it is like reading a newspaper on an airplane. There's alot better cases out there for less money. Shame on amazon for marketing this as ""goes with"" product for the sony dvd player I bought. I promptly returned it."
3,just ok,"Had to use books underneath and behind the dvd player to get it high enough out of the holder to see the screen and to have it sit straight. I tried to have it between the seats of my suv for 2nd and 3rd row to see. REALLY JUST could not get it high enough or straight enough for all to see, might work better just hooked to one seat, but needed it for more than one person to see. Also found day after could have got same price -minus shipping at target. Live and learn"
4,Works well,"This works really well as a carrying case for a portable DVD player, has a velco strap to secure it. It will fit headphones and charger and movies inside as well, has a small pocket inside and also a slim pocket on the back with it's own zipper. The straps for hanging on the back of a car seat are my only issue. The directions are way over the top and once the straps are attached to hold it up you can no longer zip it all the way closed. Overall I like it, but the straps could have a better design."
4,dvd case,"Works very good to protect my kids Sony DVD player and the conveniance of swapping into multiple vehicles, has nice compartments for extra storage. Only gripe is I wish the straps were a bit longer and an extra one to center stabalize the unit, works awesome in smaller vehs, but in my F-350 would be nice with those extra straps."
4,Great travel case/Not so great display case,"I got this to use with the Phillips 9 inch portable DVD player we purchased. I mainly got it to use as a travel case for the dvd player, accessories and dvd's. For that purpose it is great. When we tried to attach it to the back of the seat for display it kept falling off."
2,Does not function like I want it to.,"The material is awesome. Well padded, great colors. It holds dvd player really nice, along with adapter, cd's, and headphones as well. That part is fine. Its when setting it up, it lays so low my kid keeps kicking it. Both vehicles, same result, Dodge Caravan, and Toyota Highlander. Also the screen is forced forward because of the design. The DVD player should be allowed to open up more on the padded platform. This item doesn't allow that, which was the main reason for me buying it. I don't use it for this because of this reason."
4,"So far, so good","We have been balancing our portable DVD player on the armrest between the two front seats of our Subaru for years so that our son could sit in his carseat and watch movies while we make our 6 hour drive to the cousin's house. On every trip the DVD player slips - at least once - disconnecting the plug forcing me to find the place where the movie left off before the disconnect. On our last trip, we hooked up the Travel Case. The straps are a little challenging at first, but after you have it all figured out once, you are set. The straps fit easily over the back of the front passenger seat and are adjustable. My son was able to watch his movie without interruption. The case is sturdy and has lots of pockets for plugs, remotes and even DVDs. I would have liked it to be a little less expensive, but I feel like ultimately it will end up paying for itself. If you can purchase it on sale, it is a great value!"
4,Good case,"I appreciated the quick shipping. The case is good for what it's for -- holding a portable DVD player and the accessories. I could not quite figure out how to set the holder to hang from the backs of the front seats so that both kids could view the movie. They ended up holding the player in their lap, but the case did help in cutting sun glare from the sides."
5,Pleased,"This case keeps my passengers ocuppied. Easy setup, has a bunch of space for extra dvd's, my camera and ipod. Very convenient."
3,DVD Player Case,I purchased with a Sony portable DVD player for my kids to use while on long trips. It is good quality but installation and functionality are quite precarious. It does not allow the view screen to expand beyond 90 degrees which is aggravating at times. Good storage area and the duel speaker plug is very nice.
4,Love it!,This is PERFECT for the way I want to use it... as a case for the Sony DVD player we bought. Love it!
3,Good overall product.,"Good overall product, however, the connection to one of the straps broke immediately. Used a bungie-cord as a replacement."
5,EXCELLENT - In-Car Portable DVD Player / Notebook Travel Display Case - Attaches...,"Excellent product. I recommend it 100% .. The purchase was VERY SAFE AND RECEIVED QUICKLY. Enjoyable PRODUCT, THE BEST QUALITY cost."
3,"Not bad, but no spark","I grabbed this book because I liked the idea of the woman being the successful buisness person. Of course that she gives up her buisness life by the end sort of defeats that. I was kind of dissapointed in Izzy in that she didn't seem tohave any of the backbone that was needed to reach her position in the buisness world. And it seemed really melodramatic to have the wife who had caused Izzy and Will to be her best friend...and die conveniently.There just seemed to be a lack of something in this book, the characters weren't entirely alive. Though I did like alot of the supporting characters, Will's mother and Izzy's assitant for example. I also thought that there was a nice side plot developing with her in the buisness world that got cut abruptly instead of tying into the romantic plot."
5,Amazing!!!,"For those of you who really love music, and I'm not talking about the senseless sounds that are created by most musicians by todays standards. I mean adore the gift that some people can throw so much feeling into notes, then this is the album for you. The whole album is a masterpiece in my opinion, and the first three tracks will never be skipped by me. Yoshiki is the kinda musician I believe we need more of."
3,Great but expensive,"Unless you are a serious collector just wait for Deadpool Classic Vol 2, coming out April 2. It contains the first 8 issues of this series. Other than that, i love Deadpool!"
2,This is awful comic book work,"The artwork looks like it was drawn from a ""Learn how to Draw"" skechbook for nine year olds and the writing is shotty at best. Deadpool is nothing more then a mutant version of the Punisher who has no guilt about killing. Just what we need, another so-called hero who resorts to using guns and violence to resolve things."
1,misleading,"VERY misleading of this company to list this product as a 2 oz. bottle, 60 ml, and when you're ready to purchase it, it says in small letters: this is a 1 oz. bottle. That makes it twice as expensive!"
4,"yes yes, very good",This is a good quality bracelet the is both fun too look at and also has some calming properties. i reccomend these stonw chip bracelet sets highly.
4,Very well arranged,"The Borderlands of Science, like all good science books includes philosophy. When you are writing about the importance and big picture of science, writing about philosophy is inevitable and very much necessary to show the meaning. Because Shermer has so much experience in cricism it is only right that he debunk nonsciences such as remote viewing. I will be anxious for new literature."
1,Stop Reading Mike's Stupid Babble,"Mike said, ""Scientists don't consider that the absence of evidence is not evidence."" - Penn and Teller B.S.Nuff said, ignore this fake wise man. He's like a contentious genie."
3,Marred by misspellings and grammar problems,"I found Shermer's writing to be very interesting and the ideas both challenging and stimulating. However, as I read, I began to notice misspelled words and grammar problems, and by the time I reached the end of the book I was frustrated with how many there were. There were substitutions and spelling errors such as ""heals"" instead of ""heels"", ""fraudulant"" instead of ""fraudulent"", ""overweaning"" instead of ""overweening"", and grammar mistakes like ""...Galois lay the foundation for a branch of mathematics known as group theory"" (instead of 'laid').While everyone makes mistakes in writing manuscripts, a published work should be carefully checked by an editor. What happened here?"
4,a dose of reality,"the borderlands of science is a must-read for the easily influenced in today's overhyped society. shermer, in a closely reasoned, conversational style, deconstructs many of the prevailing myths that too often go unchallenged. i need to have copies of this book with me to pass along whenever i encounter (all too often) some of the ridiculous beliefs that pass for rational thought."
4,Product is good,"I had some extra time, waiting in the jury pool, so I Googled all the items listed on the MSDS. All of them make for a good degreaser in a modern sense, though it does have sodium hydroxide in it, it also has an enzymatic cleaner and a cationic surfactant.Ingredient CAS # Weight, %Po|y(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), .aIpha.-(4-nonylphenyl)-.omega.-hydroxy,branched 127087-87-O 1 - 5Tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate 64-02-8 0.5- 1.5Sodium metasilicate 6834-92-0 1 - 5Sodium hydroxide 1310-73-2 1 - 5Ethylene glycol monobutyl ether 111-76-2 1 - 5I agree with another reviewer in the wearing gloves comment the stuff did pull oil out of my fingertips when I used it it's eight dollars at local wa1mart. The smell is not very harsh. I used it on a glass cooktop with ceramic tile and grout. The grout: a yellow liquid floated to the top after sitting for a few minutes (the old cooking oil). I needed to rinse three times with a wet sponge afterwards."
1,Doesn't live up to expectatons,"This set of products doesn't even come close to living up to expectations. Don't waste your money. Stick with the good old tried and true cleaners.As for the ""foaming"" products - if they call that foam, I call a melted ice cream sundae a treat! (Strange analogy, I know - LOL!)The products come with so many dos and dont's and warnings about what surfaces you may have problems with that you're half afraid to use it on anything.Run, don't walk away from this product."
3,A Chopin like Brahms,"Biret plays Brahms as music by Chopin, very romantic, but less reasonable for Brahms. It can not enter my favorite list at first time enjoy, but, maybe later. The recording quanlity is very good."
2,would not recommend ginsu,"I researched many knife sets around this price point, and thought i was making a good choice. unfortunately after 3 washings (by hand) the knife handles have faded and the blades have what looks like rust spots. as far as cutting they are good, not great."
1,Died after 40 hours of use,"After light use of 2-3 hrs per week for ten months, player died, stopped responding. Bought a new Creative player (the Zen V) to replace it, same thing happened, this time after three days. No more Creative products for me I guess......"
4,Good player for the price,I have Zen Micro that I use most of the time but I purchased because I wanted an small FM radio to carry around when I wouldn't have the micro. I figured I might as well have an MP3 player along with it for the price.The player sounds good and gets pretty good FM reception. Having to name songs so you get album order isn't the best but at least the software makes it easy. I also don't like to have to slowly scroll through all the folders to find the album I want. The thumbwheel takes a little mastering and where you are in the menu tree isn't always intuitive. As always I upgraded headphones to get the best sound. I like AAA battery so I can always have a spare.
4,"Excellent quality, great features","Model: Creative Zen Nano Plus (1GB)I purchased this primarily for the features it provides and so far I am very satisfied with the quality and the features.- Line-in recording.records in mp3 format (96, 128, 160 Kbps).It requires a smaller plug for the line-in and the included wire is very small, so recording from TV etc. might be problematic. But I guess you can buy a longer cable.- FM radio and recording.Records in WAV, not sure why they would do that.No time-based recording.Recording FM will need the headphone cable plugged in, coz thats the antenna.- softwareless transfer.So I can use it as a USB stick.U can also transfer the recorded track to your pc, without software, just copy-paste."
2,Not really meant for sports use ....,"It's small and lightweight, great sound, good battery life.However ..... My first one stopped dead after six months and the second one started developing lcd screen problems after only 3 months. It's not really designed for sports use where someone might actually sweat, even with the silicone case and the arm band. The battery cover is flimsy and not well attached (cheap)."
5,Very Pleased,I was very pleased about the size and how easy it was to transfer files to the device. The audio quality with the enclosed ear buds is excellent. The installation of the device's software was straightforward and simple. The battery life has been excellent and there are no moving parts to breakdown! I think some improvments could be made on the thumbwheel that is used to select different menu items because it can be difficult sometimes to select the correct function. Overall it is a excellent choice for a user that is interested in MP3 music or podcast listening.
4,good product for the price,"Ordered this after doing a little research. I was looking for an inexpensive MP3 player that would give me a couple of hours of music while riding my motorcycle. The size lets if fit perfectly inside my jacket and the sound quality is excellent for such a small device.I find it difficult to negotiate the wheel and buttons due to their small size, and the ear buds that accompany the player don't seem to fit my ears for some reason. Otherwise, not a bad item for the price."
1,"waste money, not worth it","I bought this recorder for school and my music rehearsal. I am very disappointed with this product.(1) First of all, the TINY TINY clip of the battery cover broke after one month I bought, so now I have to use tape to hold the battery cover.(2) you basically have to put the device up to the person's mouth to be able to record the voice clearly. I sit 4 or 5 feet away from my professor in the class room and it came out sooooo low, and unclear. So I gave up recording for the lecture(3) I also use this to record my music rehearsal. Music recording came out like a broken speaker playing harsh musicFor the price (70 to 80 dollars street price) I will add 20 more to buy something else more reliable and better.It is just so not worthy the money to buy a poorly made 1 GB mp3 player. so what.."
4,Buyers Beware!!!!!!!!!,Its Great Little Player And It Has 1 GIG But It Can Only Hold 31 Artist!!!!If Not I Whould Of Rated 5. Stars So Beware
2,Firmware defect! 25 scale volume system is AWFUL!!,"Its confirmed that every player with the 1.11.01 firmware is DEFECTIVE an MOST nano plus players use this defective firmware.The problem is that even at the lowest volume setting of 1 it plays WAY too loud! Going from 0 to 1 is like turning the player on and off. Its ridiculous! The volume just does NOT go any lower and due to this it makes the player USELESS in quiet areas.How could they have released the player like this? Its unreal.When the first nano plus players came out they used the great 40 scale volume system which worked GREAT. Now with this firmware and the 25 scale volume system its AWFUL.Oh ya the ""FM recording"" records at a very low bit rate and in WAV format. This produces awful record quality and makes this feature 100% usless. No joke."
1,"Short lived, then died.","This player was sold under the name MuVo-N200 and then they changed the name to Zen Nano Plus. Probably to pick up on the Nano craze. It looks great. Small. and worked out of the package for a couple months. Then it died. Would not turn on any more. Contacted Creative and got the ""download the latest driver, etc"". This doesn't fix the problem. Sent it back(painfull). They send another. Works for 2 months. Dies. Couldn't bring myself to go through the gut renching customer service thing again. Then reconsidered and started the process. Got a third player. Worked for 2 months then died. This process has taken a couple years off my life. Their customer service repeatedly says, ""this never happens, we have had no complaints from other customers"". Then I read all these similar bad experiences. Who wants to buy a product from a company that is unreliable and will not admit its faults. Let me know if you find an mp3 manufacture with some better reliablity."
1,creative labs is a bad company w/ bad product,"I owned this device for 5 months and it just stopped working... I went though all the proper channels for repair and was told they want at least $25.00 to ""work"" on my warranty repair. It turns out only parts are covered for a year and labor only for 3 months. This is NOT what I call standing behind your product.DON'T BUY CREATIVE PRODUCTS! Not only are they poorly made, but Creative knows this and doesn't stand behind their own products."
1,avoid this one,I purchased the creative nano plus and within 3 weeks it simply died on me. I tried to get through to their tech support or customer support and after pressing a zillion buttons then being put on hold for 15 mins i gave up. Avoid this like the plague
5,Put songs in the order you like.,"One of the big reasons not mentioned to purchase this product is the software allows you to put the songs in the order you like. It is not sophistocated but it works. My two Rio products do not allow this. Who wants to hear music in alphabetical order? Well, not me. I want to order them the way I like. My only complaint is my Nano seems to hold only about 110 songs (regardless of length) and uses half of the 1 gb memory. I can splice any number of songs together to make one long song so as not to violate this 110 limit as long as the memory is available. Maybe I do not know how to set it up. Anyway, 110 songs is more than I'll ever need at the gym."
4,Amazing,"I have a zen nano plus. I love it!! It works great for me and it's very easy to work. At my school, it's the most popular thing. The only down side is that whenever you try to put more songs, it erases the others. But, even still it is worth the money. I hope you buy your own, they are great!!"
1,Do not buy this product!!!,"This is a defective product! Your computer will not ""see"" the player, so you will not be able to download! Creative released a firmware update that does NOTHING to solve the problem!!"
4,"Great, all purpose MP3 Player","I had read that the Zen Nano Plus was comparable to the IPod Shufle, though I had not tried either product first. The Nano is great! I like being able to use it as a flash drive as well as music / audio book player. I don't use the radio much but I'm glad it's an option. Battery life is good, it retains it's position when it turns off and offers a lot of flexibility in navigation, though the screen and font size are a little small. Still, it's indispensible to me now!"
5,Works for me,"All I do with it is listen to mp3s. It works. The skip mechanism is a little touchy since the skip wheel is also the select button if pushed but I do not skip more than a few times a day so it doesn't bother me. The menu is a little more complicated than some others I have used but it has everything I need and only takes a few more minutes to learn(if you do not use the manual).-Best: it does play music with good sound, has an easily readible display, is extremely light and a good shape(simular to a pack of gum), and pretty good battery life( for a single AAA battery). Overall I am very happy with my purchase."
4,Very Pleased Purchaser,"I use the player primarily to listen to audio books and the FM radio. I find the quality excellent. My only complaint is that the instructions are extremely lacking. I am a novice user and need more information than is contained in the operation directions. I don't know what many of the little signs are and how to use them and the directions are rather useless for someone who is not real experienced with MP3 players. However, I like the player very much- it downloads fast, forward/reverses quickly. I wish that it had a display showing the time remaining to the end of a book."
4,Lots in a little package,"Bought a month ago, after looking at an Ipod, originally interested because, unlike Ipod, the supporting software runs on older Windows platforms [Ipod is limited to XP]. As it worked out, this wasn't critical for the way I use it, but would have been a problem with the Ipod.On balance, I am delighted with the Nano. The memory [1GB] is certainly adequate for my use, and up and downloading is very easy. More critically, it is easy to find music and play it, although probably not quite as convenient as an Ipod, since the space for controls is limited.About the only [minor] complaint I have is the lack of a volume control when recording. I would also like to be able to record off the air, but this appears not to be an option. In all fairness, I bought it without paying any attention to either the record feature or the FM radio, and still think I got my money's worth. The Zen Nano is a lot of capability in a very small package."
2,very poor construction,"I ordered this player and returned it for the same problem 3 separate times. The problem was that the volume buttons rattled around loosely inside the plastic shell. I called Creative the first time to see if perhaps this was the way it was supposed to be (and I was being too picky). They assured me that no, it was not supposed to do that and I should return it for another one. By the time I went through 2 more players with the same issue, I was frustrated to say the least. I called Creative again to see if there was anything they could do (such as open up the package and check it before they sent it). The customer service rep said that there was nothing they could do. What's up with that? The plastic case reminds one of a child's toy that would break easily. With all that being said, I bought one for my wife at the same time that I got the first one, and she hasn't had any of these problems. You decide."
3,Beware,ALthough the product works wonderfully and I love how small it is and how long the battery life is. I was shocked to find that it does not work with Napster To Go subscription service. You must purchase the tracks you want to place on the zen first. I should have read much closer. So if you belong to Napster and think that you can download music with To Go Subscription think again. You can not!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,Save yourself some headaches and DO NOT PURCHASE the Creative Zen Nano Plus. It was trouble right out of the box.I consider myself to be pretty tech savy (I work in IT). And I've owned 4 other mp3 players. I also made the mistake of disregarding the other negative reviews of this product.This device would randomly turn itself off and lock up. I tried everything available on the Creative support site. Nothing fixed the problem.Do yourself a favor and save another 50 bucks and buy yourself an iPod Nano.
1,Extremely disappointing.,"It is a toy.Researched similar items,decided to purchase this item.Installation was a zip. But.... Could not play back anything but the installed audio intro, something to the fact that I should visit the Website to learn more about it...Even that exhibited hiss and hum..Tried,tried tried.I consider myself very electronically knowlegeable.Sadly the only thing remotely logical about the whole experiance was the fact that there was the very same model MP3 Player already laying on the customer service counter At Walmart when I returned mine ..Shame on you Creative...."
2,Cheap and poor!,"Lots of cons, but for me it was extremely negative that the battery cover is sooo poorly and cheaply made that it breaks easily.SO if you still want this player, be avare! (and operate it very gently)In addition I still find it anoying that there comes a small beep when the player switches on/off and somtimes with low volume the same occures between songs."
3,Bad battery compartment,"I like this player except for the battery case -- it's very loose and when it disconnects and stops in the middle of a book, it can't resume where it left off. Now the catch is broken, so I have to tape it shut, which is a real pain."
2,Great Until It Quit After 13 Months,"I owned my Zen Nano Plus for 13 months before it stopped working. The LCD will still light up for a few seconds after I try to power up, then it shuts down. My computer won't recognize it, so I can't update firmware. Since I'm 13 months out, I can't get any support from Creative, except for paying $13. I'm going to buy a different, cheaper brand. I dont expect things to last forever, but 13 months? C'mon."
5,good value,I bought the Zen Nano last week and it is a great player to run with. The ear plugs are a little large so I bought Koss Sparkplugs and they work well with the player.The software and instructions are vague but overall this player is a good value.
3,overall solid mp3 player,"I've had this mp3 player for a couple of weeks and for the most part it is a pretty good buy.Pros: SMALL (almost too small), no need for propietary software like ipods and other brands, can use windows explorer to drag and drop songs and other files, 1 gig is more than plenty and can easily hold over 250 regular sized songs, really liked the fact that it is one of the only mp3 players that also have a direct line in and built in microphoneCons: Biggest drawback, cant browse through other songs while current one is playing such as in Ipod or Iriver, I found volume to be a bit low when trying to play through car stereo (this might be the same for other players I dont know), since everything is controlled through one button I am concerned about how long it will last."
2,shiped stuffed in an envelope,Kinda sketchy that they arrived loose in a envelope. Makes me wonder if I can really trust that they haven't been tampered with.
2,is it just me?,i got this thinking it'd be perfect but it sucks.i dont know what they put in the lubricant but it makes it so hard for my hubby to ejaculate or enjoy the experience.i guess they put it there to make sure the female comes since it takes women longer but i didnt enjoy that cos i dont have a problem with that.its just dissapointing that he has to work so hard to reach orgasm no matter what we do so we stopped using them and am switching to something different.it fit ok and doesnt slip or break and thats why i gave it 2 stars.the perfume is also ok.
2,Durex condoms,"They were definitely thin, but they weren't big at all. After some experimentation to find ""large"" condoms that fit, I can safely say that these strangled me the quickest and most completely."
3,Ehhhhhh,"Definitely NOT thin. Still too small for my man's penis :) Look at different brands. But if you're looking for something new, these are good to experiment with."
3,Durex,"They are thin. But, were smaller than Trojan Magnum. A bit disappointing in that reguard as they were listed in the larger condom section. Good for the price."
2,Works...,"Works, does the job but very boring. It is just a thin condom that really is VERY BORING! NO! Nubbies are better!"
2,Not Impressed,"My boyfriend is only able to wear larger condoms and most end up not feeling so great for either of us. When I saw ""larger and thinner for more sensitivity and sensation"" I thought I'd try it, thinking the larger part was true. Not so. If you need larger condoms don't buy these."
1,will never buy again.,"first off, i know how to correctly use this product.that being said i have had the misfortune of THREE of these breaking during use. twice while the female was in a reverse cowgirl and once in ""doggy"" style.maybe i got a ""bad batch"", but i am never going to give these a second chance."
2,just average to me,"Mariah Carey sounds decent here,but then again this song sounds more along the lines of what she was doing musically from 1996-1999.the Beats&vocal Arrangements ain't changed much.it's a typical Jermaien Dupri Production&doesn't really show alot.it's a safe radio choice but not a knock out radio choice to debut a Album that Mariah truly needs to re-connect.Her Re-Mixes are cool which has always been One of her Many Musical Strengths as a Artist."
3,It's Like That...Remixes aren't what I expected!,"I love getting Mariah's single because she always has some of the hottest remixes. I must say I was very disappointed with these remixes of ""It's Like that"".David Morales (Club Mix & Classic Mix) has done a better job of remixing Mariah's songs in the past. These two mixessound similar.The No Rap Version of ""It's like That"", Should have never been released. Without Fatman Scoop and JD to hype the track up,It just fails to deliver the goods!The Stero Experience mix, is lengthy but its a good dance track. It's in a class all by itself. This single is worthbuying alone for this track.The Original version of ""It's Like That"" is the hot. Perfect for the first single. This up-tempo track produced by Jermaine Dupri has a nice beat and a catchy hook."
3,"Good Song, But Slightly Disappointing","Ever since ""Rainbow"", Mariah has consistanty neglected her seven-octave ballads in favor of hip-hop jams. I don't understand why. Yes, she is part African-American, but Mariah just doesn't seem ""ghetto"" to me. After there were quite a few ballads on her last release, ""Charmbracelet"", I thought Mariah's infatuation with hip-hop was over and she'd return to her forte- old-school ballads. No such luck. ""It's Like That"", the much-hyped first single off of ""The Emancipation of Mimi"" is as ""street"" as it gets. If Ashanti or Ciara were releasing this, I'd be satisfied, but I know Mariah aka ""Mimi"" is capable of so much more. Mariah, BRING ON THE BALLADS!!!!!!!!"
3,Its OK,"Mariah would have done a better job singing Niveas hit with Lil Jon instead of this almost-wack song. Its an good song for a hip-hop club but it gets annoying on the radio (im not saying its BAD, but a bad choice for opening single). I enjoy We Belong Together a lot more. Mariah could have done a lot better for an opening club-like R&B track. I really think she could have had a bigger hit if she worked with Lil Jon, but thats just my opinion. I just bought her latest album so well see how that is. C+"
4,Marc J. Ellison,"This is a very informative book that investigates why we think the way we do about money and what mental games we play that can get us into so much trouble. The book is not a fun or easy book to read, but it does have very good information."
5,Proust has nothing on Belsky.,"Proust has nothing on Belsky. This book has changed my life amd how I deal with the greatest unknown variable: money. This one is brilliant and essential.Like the bible, this tome is eternal"
2,Overated Book,While some of the book is interesting it is more geared for the beginner in investing. A lot of the issues brought up are nothing more than common sense. I read it in a couple of days and felt let down by the simplistic approach to investing problems and the suggested solutions.
4,"Frustrating, but an easy read, and covers the concepts","The book covers a number of phenomena related to ""mental accounting"" (the tendency to treat money differently depending on its source) and prospect theory (differences in the pain of loss versus the please of gain, for the same amount). It's a very easy read, although the offered explanations for investment and spending behavior seem self-contradictory at times--they explain both why people hold on to a dog too long, and why people sell out of an investment too soon. For a brief, pleasant introduction to behavioral economics, this book is not bad."
4,A good place to give your investment strategy a logic check,"This book takes some relatively heady behavioral economic ideas and applies them to everyday investment scenarios. No one is going to create a black box trading model using this book alone, but it does provide some sound principles for every investor (from novice through expert) to use as tests for cognitive and behavioral biases. Definitely worth a read, and very readable."
4,sound analysis,"This book describes and analyzes a variety of psychological tendencies that affect decision making. The fact that they point out these tendencies and make readers aware of them and think about it is valuable by itself.The descriptions of these tendencies are accurate and to the point. The book is also easy to follow, while making you stop and think.The money/investment advice offered is basic and mediocre."
1,Disappointing,"After reading the McKittrick Triology that takes place in the present, I had thought this one would be exciting since it took place in the early days of Texas. It is a MAJOR snooze. Linda Lael Miller is a much better author than this book. Sorry Linda. I was bored silly."
5,McKettrick's Choice,Great plot and I enjoyed the book . I am loaning it to my 91 year old mother to read.
2,McKettrick's Orders,"My first venture into the McKettrick family and that's enough. I can't think of a more preposterous cattle drive if I tried. An 8 mo. pregnant woman, another feather brained 30 yr old woman that grew up in Texas and doesn't know how to ride a horse, handle a gun with no common sense at all. Then they pick up a 5 mo. old deaf orphan and go merrily on their way. The person in charge of baby is mentally challenged and needed someone to care for her too. Course they make the entire round trip with only one guy shot in the arm and one with a broken leg. The only thing that would have stretched the fairy tale any more would have been for the baby to be born on the trail, delivered by the boss man."
4,Holt's story,Linda Miller's books always thrill. I waited for Holt's story and his romance with the runaway bride is charming. This is what romance is supposed to be
4,Cattle Drive Romance,"This is a good western romance love story set in the 1880s in Texas and Arizona. It's about a strong gallant cowboy falling for a very strong-willed, independent woman who is used to living a cushy life in town but left her home for ranching. Their encounters are humorous but the book is a bit far-fetched with all the dangers they encounter without getting hurt or killed. Holt, the cowboy, came across as some sort of super hero. I enjoyed it though. Lorelei, Holt's love interest, was very brave. The main plot wasn't really about love, but more about Holt's coming to the rescue of friends in trouble, sort of like Superman."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this book with the intention of learning the thoughts, procedures and techniques of the Godolphin Stables of Dubai while persuing a Derby win. The amount of information on these subjects could have been put on one page. Instead there was page after page of race results, the history of horse racing in general and famous race courses in particular, quotes and conversations with trainers, plus I picked up on a definite anit-Royal Family attitude. Also, the contents of the book has no continuity and seem to be just a collection of facts and records. I think think the title is very misleading and did not finish the book."
3,smaller and lighter than expected,"This knife is not my favorite. As a former culinary professional I prefer a knife with more weight and a heavier blade. I use it more as a utility knife than a chefs knife. It does keep a sharp edge and is easy to keep clean. Probably a good choice if you have small hands or like a small, light knife."
4,Really? It's a 3 1/2.,"I wasn't thrilled with this purchase. The box it came in was HUGE because the knife packaging is so long, too long. It was my first ""really good knife"" purchase. I thought it would be a little lighter, and even sharper. Then again I wasn't aware that those ""really, really, really good knives"" are super expensive. So, I guess I got what I paid for. Perhaps you're paying a little more for this just for the Emeril label."
2,not pink,"These earrings are purple, not even close to the pink pictured. For the price, I gave them to my neighbor's daughter instead of returning them, Cute, but not pink."
5,Highly recommended!,"Swarovski has been making crystal jewelry since 1892, and their consistent quality has kept the company going through wars and the rise and fall of empires. These cute earrings are made of sterling silver and Swarovski crystals, and are quite attractive. If you are looking for some nice, crystal and silver earrings, then these are the ones to get.By the way, they look great when combined with the Heart, Star and Starburst crystal tattoos - which I also highly recommend!(Review of Sterling Silver Dark Pink Fuschia Genuine Swarovski Crystal Three Bar Earrings)"
3,CALIFORNIA KING....NOT KING!,"These are great sheets; very soft and comfortable. However, as is often the case when ordering CALIFORNIA king size, the top sheet is only a King...not long enough for the extra 4 inches in a California King size bed. I am considering a return. The top sheet of this set needs to be about six inches longer."
5,The best flannel sheets we've found,"I'm very fond of good flannel sheets, and these are easily the nicest ones I've found - especially for the money. The price is quite variable over time; as low as $65 or so and as high as $100 (for a set of queen size sheets). I've happily paid either price, because the sheets are just so good. They're markedly better than the 190gm pinzon sheets, and worth the bit of extra money - they last longer, stay softer and pill less.Given that most companies want well over $100/set for 6oz flannel sheets, these are an amazing value."
4,Very pleased with Pinzon 200 Gram Supima Velvet Flannel Sheets,"I love substantial flannel sheets which are difficult to find (most are 5 oz. and I believe these weigh in at about 6) and when you do find them they can easily run $50 per king sheet (which is what I buy). When I found these on Amazon I read the reviews and in an uncharacteristic manner decided to believe them and go for it. I am happy to say that they are delicious, a good heavy weight and wash well. I chose the saffron which is slightly misnamed...I was expecting more of a warm gold and less of a warm khaki (they are browner than I expected)....but I am used to them and would buy another set in a New York minute. I do agree with one of the other reviewers that it would be great if there were a greater assortment of color....say.... a pumpkin..."
5,Pleasantly Pleased,"As a long time flannel sheet user...we use them year 'round...I have purchased many sets over the years. Usually they are great until you wash them a few times and then they begin to pill or feel hard. And I'm talking heavy weight, supposedly very good quality sheets. But these sheets have given me new hope. I have washed them MANY times now and they are still as soft and fluffy as when first purchased. NO pilling whatsoever. The proof was in my lint catcher in the dryer. Not nearly the loss of fiber I have found in previous flannel sheets. GREAT PRODUCT!!!"
1,Short sheeted!,"The sheets arrived in good time, but they have yet been on my bed. Why? I have a California King sized bed, (with appro. pillows), and my sheet set arrived with one king pillow case and one standard! I have told all the appropiate parties and have not had any resulting solution. I even offered to go 50/50 on a set of CA pillow cases. The person that responded said OK and then said they would give me 30% off. What's a woman to do??? My next step is boxing the set up and returning them for a refund. Anybody out there give a darn????Judy"
5,Awesome sheets,"I had been using Macy's brand flannel and was pretty happy with them but after using these my standard for comfort has skyrocketed.The sheets washed great - couldn't tell if there was any shrinkage but the fitted sheet fit my 18"" deep puffy mattress without a lot of pulling and stretching to get that last corner.The top sheet went from the head of the bed leaving about 4"" to tuck at the feet.Soft, Soft, Soft - these sheets are so fantastically soft."
5,"The BEST flannel sheets...aaahhh, so soft!","Very nice quality and well made. Color is great. Washed them delicate and warm, dried them low and slow. Superb softness unlike no other flannel I have bought! WELL worth the cost. You will love them like I do."
5,AMAZING,BEST flannel sheets I've ever had! So soft and luxurious!! Don't hesitate...buy a set NOW!!!
5,Best Flannel Sheets EVER,"I just purchased the 200 gram flannel sheets in saffron, and they are the best flannel sheets I've ever owned. They are so thick/dense you cannot see through them when you hold them up to the light. Whatever process they use to create the ""velvet"" part of these sheets is amazing. It feels like velvet and hasn't pilled yet (washed weekly, slept on them for a week already). The color is nice, too; sort of a very gold yellow color. They are so warm! No more frozen feet!"
1,Very soft but not durable at all,"I ordered these sheets and washed them right away. The first night I used them, they ripped with very little use. The hole is too big to even fix by sewing. I will continue to use the flat sheet and pillowcases, because I already have them. But the fitted sheet ripped way too easy for being brand new."
5,Luxury Thy Name is Supima,"These are by far the nicest flannel sheets I've ever slept on - hands down. I washed them before using and they had ZERO pilling and very little was left in the lint trap.They seemed a little pricey to me at first, given that I've only bought flannel sheets on clearance before, but now I realize that you really do get what you pay for in flannel sheets. I bought mine when they were an Amazon deal of the day for $36.99. I'd gladly pay more for these. Good Egyptian cotton usually costs more and they aren't nearly as luxurious as these.I highly recommend these. What a great gift they would make, too."
2,I loved these at first...,"I washed the sheets as soon as I took them out of the package. I was skeptical of sleeping on flannel because I have always found flannel sheets to be rough. However, once I got between these sheets, I felt like I was in a warm cocoon. Even my husband remarked on the warm softness of the sheets. It was heavenly and I didn't think I would ever sleep on any other type of sheet. Then, after a week on the bed, the nap on the bottom sheet has become a bit rough. I am really disappointed. I will wash them tomorrow and will probably turn the bottom sheet over - for the softer nap, until they roughen up like the other side. These were wonderful sheets out of the package. I might just be too picky but it's worth writing this review - for other picky people out there."
3,Great value if you don't mind page number discrepancies,"This book was an EXCELLENT value! The 8th Edition cost for this book is $150!! The only drawback is that you will experience some discrepancies with page numbers in your course syllabus and may have to occasionally pull up a given case online. But when you're a strapped student, every dollar of savings is a lifesaver!"
4,One of the best books available on a difficult subject,"Most people shy away from the subject of death until it intrudes on their, otherwise comfortable, lives. Da Avabhasa, through a series of transcribed lectures and essays reveals the knowledge of this subject only available to a realized being. That he experiences the phenomenal world differently to most others makes the writing occasionally tricky to follow, but never give up, the knowledge contained, in this book, has the ability to remove your fear of this topic.Take the classic book ""On Death and Dying"" and explain it with the understanding, knowledge and compassion of one who is fully realized in his relationship with the Divine and you have this invaluable book."
4,Must have for the serious collector,"I bought the CD for the Intro:Conditional Discharge, which i had not heard for a very long time. Was supprised to learn Elton John was the Pianoist, looks like to me anyway. Other tunes are good as well, Black Girl, It Ain't Easy and I'm Ready...A good addition to anyone's collection. My belief is if you are a serious collector then buy the CD, don't just d-load it."
5,bob,Outstanding. I've been looking for this Long John Baldry Intro for a long time. This is the only place I've found it.
5,It Ain't Easy But It's Great!!!,"Long John Baldry has been legendary since he began his journey through the Blues Clubs of Britain. His graveled vocals and hard hitting style have attracted some of the industries best known performers; all eager to do something, anything, with him. It Ain't Easy includes input from Rod Stewart, Elton John, Bernie Taupin and Madelene Bell (a.k.a. Marion Bell the female voice from Gimme Shelter). The story-telling and musical accompaniment are superb. The ""drive"" in his music is unmistakably angry and soft at the same time. Check it out. It's worth the price."
4,surf's up,"This item was exactly as advertised. It was very light, well made, and easy to move. It's an excellent beginner board."
3,(Mostly) Great Information.,"This book is organized well, easy to understand, and fairly insightful into the personalities of others (and myself). However, I have to give it 3 stars because throughout the book God and even Jesus Christ is mentioned many times. I for one have no idea what Christianity has to do with learning to deal with annoying people. Obviously people of all faiths (including the absence of any) can learn through social science, philosophy, psychology, and the like without having God forced-fed down their throat. I am no satanist, but if knew this book was full of religious propaganda, I would not have ordered it. Authors are of course free to write any religious self-help books they want, however they must be marketed as such without having to read chapters into it in order to see what the true message is. I am doing my best to block out what dogma the authors managed to slip in, while still recognizing the valuable information worth reading."
5,Christianity Meets the Holy Spirit,"An excellent book for someone willing to take on the task of getting along with other people. Short,concise and very informative. Helps one to see why you do what you do, and how to respond to other people's behaviour, not the perceived intents and motives of the heart. Very practical, and highly recommended."
1,Doesn't cover communications at all.,Let's start with stating that I create HMI's/SCADA systems for a living. I have used all the major commercial software including Wonderware and iFIX. This book was interesting. But as far as I'm concerned it left out the most important information. The author wants you to use a demo version of the software that 'talks' with the PLC. For me it's the reading and writing to the PLC that is important. There really needs to be a section on serial or TCP/IP communications to really make it worth something long term. The driver you would have to buy to use this more than a fun activity cost about $1000.
2,Poor Performance,I'm sorry but Idils versions of these masterpieces is the really poor. Etude #4 op.10 is the worst version of it I've heard. If you're looking into getting the recording of these etudes do not get Birets version. The etudes are some of my favorite Chopin pieces but this recording!
4,many favorites on one cd,"This is a pretty cool little selection of synthesizer tracks. Some are up-tempo and engaging, others are slow and relaxing. Great companion for workouts. The version of ""Mammagamma"" is a little different from the original but I like this one better, which is why I bought the CD.(I first came across the song on a different release of this CD many years ago and recently decided to try and find it)"
1,Don't believe the hype,"Not only did it get to me after several weeks but the amount was so much smaller than anticipated as the jar was 3/4 filled. I can go to the most expensive gourmet food purveyor in Los Angeles and get better quality salt from Il de Re for far less money. Also, there are far better quality Il de Re versions of this salt. It is not white and flaky as it should be but grey with large crystals. Poor quality, slow to send, expensive. Never again"
2,If this is the savior of music then consider me an atheist,"What's the deal with the UK's recent obsession with American redneck culture?? To compare ""Party Hard"" with Nirvana is the most noxiously inaccurate ridiculousness I've experienced in a LONG time. This band is a joke, whether they intend to be or not. The video is at least worth a laugh though, once you get over the initial slack-jawed reaction of horror that everyone I know had when they first saw it. 1 star if they mean it, 3 stars if this is a ""Spinal Tap""-style jab at everything that's wrong with the world, and I REALLY hope it's a joke."
1,You're kidding...right?!,"Wow. This is really awful. Reminds me of the Reagan era. I don't know what else to say.No...wait; yes I do. Andrew W.K. MAY be making this music in earnest, and make no mistake that this is PAARrty music, but it is terribly boring party music. Full of bombast, but it doesn't stick and it won't last. I think back to some great dancing/drinking/sexy music, and this don't doesn't hold up under their grooviness. Think of Jerry Lee Lewis, the Meters, Jackson Five, The Cars, Prince, KISS, Funkadelic, even the Bee Gees...will you remember these Andrew WK songs in light of these others? I'm betting not. Then again, if the sonic equilvalent of Mc Donalds is what you are into (read: filling, but ultimately empty), this may be your thing."
1,Complete Rubbish,"This song is a complete joke,it is not even up to the standard of being an anthem.How can you abuse the guitar so much,use it in a disgrace and give it a bad name.This song is lacking in tune and melody.The repetitive chords are simple and don't sound very good.The bass and drumming are boring and the singing is just a joke.The video for this song isn't even worth watching.I certainly hope Andrew W.K. released this song as a joke and their other songs on the album are up to standard."
4,Good book for beginner.,"This book has been quite helpful for my husband who is setting up his first planted aquarium. It is well organized, informative, and easy to read. The authors offer suggestions of compatible fish as well as plants, substrates, and water management."
2,Not the authorative guide to this battle,This firefight is compelling however Naylor's book is described by Special Forces personnel (not even close to being one- just have discussed the book with some) as much more accurate.Respect to all that have and are serving!!!
3,Follow up,If you liked this book you may be interested in another book written by someone who was there. Captain Nathan Self led the Army Rangers on Takur Ghar Mountain and tells the story from a first han point of view as well as what our soldiers deal with after the battle is over.
3,It was ok,"The story was good, but at times I found it difficult to visualize where soldiers were located on the mountain. The author spends a good amount of words (possibly too many) describing their positions in great detail - so much detail that it became a blur. Otherwise, a good read."
5,Another great book about Afghanistan.,"Got this book for Christmas and could'nt put it down! A great read. Very insightful and informative about the battle of Takur ghar. Malcolm Macpherson really does a good job of retelling the story, the real story from the guys who were there."
5,Outstanding,"I read it in one day. I couldn't put it down. Read the interviewees, because it lists the medals awarded."
