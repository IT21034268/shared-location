4,recommended,"I disagree with the other reviews. I found this book illuminating.It is more basic vision science than disease focused. However, for ophthalmologists or optometrists that would like to better understand the theory of vision and visual anomalies, this is a perfect book. In addition, there is not a topic that this book does not touch. I recommend it."
1,An absolute disgrace,"This book is an excresence. Nowhere is there any evidence of the liberal application of an editor's red ink. I suspect even the authors do not understand their topic; there is no other explanation as to why the subject is so dense and poorly presented. Topics and concepts are introduced without explanation, and nowhere is any information integrated. The subtitle: ""Clinical Application"" surely has to be some form of joke.This book ought to be consigned to the annals of history. It is time for another authority; one whose style is not a relic from the 1950s."
5,"No pain, no gain","Yes, this can be a difficult book to read, and the end of each chapter does bring a feeling of relief.However, since I first had to scour it cover-to-cover almost 20 years ago, I have not found another single volume resource that is so authoritative. If you are planning ophthalmic research or education this is a good place to start your study. Unfortunately, a lot of the established medical canon is just not logical to us in retrospect. I mean, who on earth named the retinal layers? Was the complement cascade nomenclature designed to frustrate people out of medical school? (yes, I know some stuff was discovered later so the numbers had to be fudged, but still).Anyway, I had to put my two pence in because this book deserves a high rating."
1,Outdated . . . Get The Newest Edition!,"This was a nice collection a few years ago, but the newest edition is anticipated to be published in September 2004. I recommend waiting for the new edition, which is, by the way, priced $10 cheaper on the Joel Whitburn site. :-)"
2,Not what I expected,"Sadly, I was expecting a book that covered a wide range of idea's and how to's with leather. While this book did cover using leather, I was say that 90%-95% of the information in the book was on how to do basic book binding. And you can get that data with much less expensive books! While it was well written, anyone with a mild amount of experance with book binding will have already known most of what is in the book...."
2,Broken bowl and dinner plate,I bought this and had it on rush order because I wanted to use this for Thanksgiving. I received it today and one bowl is totally shattered and a dinner plate is split in the middle. There isn't an email I can direct my complaint too. I wanted a replacement from amazon but I have to send back the broken plate and bowl which will cost more money to get a replacement. I'm not happy.
3,The Quality Has Slipped over Three Years,"I ordered two of these Fagor 2-Quart Double Boilers w/Steamer Inserts three years apart. The first was for myself in September, 2007, and a second was a gift for a friend in December, 2010.The one I received felt good & solid; quality cookware I thought. However, I recently visited the friend whom I had gifted with this item and was surprised to find that hers was thin, lightweight, and did _not_ have a quality feel. The the doubler and steamer inserts did not seat securely in the base pan. Her copy functions, but the quality is not nearly comparable the quality of my 2007 purchase and is definitely NOT a gift quality item.The time has past for obtaining a quality copy of this double boiler."
4,Great for a small kitchen!,"This product is the perfect size for small or occasional projects, and the steamer insert makes it a doubly useful tool. I'm also really fond of the glass lid. Great choice for the price!"
2,"A great idea, not so perfect in reality","I got this as a gift early this year. It arrived with a huge split near a rivet for the handle. It took me 10 weeks to get a replacement from Fagor. They did send one, and all so I guess that's something. Shortly after finally getting the replacement we noticed the boiler insert has a similar split. Aarg. My husband said something about overworked and under annealed stainless. Here's hoping it doesn't split further.As for functionality, it works. Why the double boiler insert is so much smaller than the pot baffles me though. I would have much preferred a larger double boiler insert. As it is I end up doing multiple batches to get my chocolates melted for truffles. It works, just not convenient.It cleans up easily and serves it function. I just wish the quality was a bit better."
1,Product has limited use,"If you need a vegetable steamer then think again, this has no perforations int he lower compartment so you can really onyl steam one bowl"
5,Love it,Hero is good I like how everyone has certain of power and connect the whole story together.And they are not like those fighting a lot's super power movie but they concentrate more on the story.
4,"Great price, Heroes Season 2 Sucks Though","Considering you get both Heroes Season 1 AND Season 2 for less than what Season 1 costs alone at places like Best Buy makes this an excellent deal. I admit I'm not a fan of many TV series, my big brother made me watch Season 1 and I was hooked. Sadly Season 2 was terrible...but I'm now hooked into the series..so I continue to watch Heroes all the way to the most current episode in Season 3 pt 2.~G"
5,yaaahh taa !!! best series ever.,"If you are any kind of a superhero fan , this series was made for you. I would say this is just a more realistic version of x-men . Human mutation and evolution gave awesome powers to certain individuals and all these individuals are somehow connected with each other. Some individuals try to use their powers for good and some for evil and some just been hiding to avoid detection from regular humans because of fear of persecution. Each of these characters will not only discover their powers and learn how to use them but they also will discover a series of events that been happening from a long time and how these events affected their lives. During this process some will use these powers for good and some will use it for evil and some just some they will use it for their own personal gain. I am pretty sure you will love this so I invite you to give it a try. My favorite character is hiro yakamoto , yaahh taaah !!"
5,gotta Love Stewie,Very Happy with it all. Showed up on time in great shape its in with the rest of my collection
4,A good laugh,My boyfriend and I enjoyed a weekend at home watching this. We had a 3 extended laugh out loud moments that made us very happy.
3,Just barely make the grade...,"Family Guy used to be very funny without many horrific scenes, making fun of things without being too offensive. But I have noticed that the quality of the gags has really dropped off recently. They concentrate more on violent, bloody scenes, sexual scenes, and it is really hard to watch. Price is also an issue, and as other customers have said, their extra episodes (DVD only) is just stupid stuff that nobody want to watch. So I would recommend another series, unless they really make a big change to the personnel and Family Guy becomes great gain. Again, this DVD set is still pretty good and will give you a good laugh if you are watching the series for the first time. However, don't expect it to be as great as it was before."
5,family guy fan,"i've always care for this series, in fact I have all the collection. hahahahahah you'll laugh with peter's stupidity and his none sense."
5,love it family guy is the best be glad to see season 11,love it will buy more later when it comes to dvd is there going to be a family guy movie
5,Freakin' Awesome!,Look it's Family Guy - of course it's freakin' awesome! If you are new to Family Guy - you need this. If you are a life long fan like me - this is mandatory!
2,"Jesus vs mohammad, God vs allah","Is it true that Seth is working on a special celebrity deathmatch kinda deal? Jesus vs mohammad and God vs allah, tag team match. The king of controversy strikes again. Watch out Fox!"
2,Stale And Unoriginal,"I use to be a big Family Guy fan, but I'm coming to realize Family Guy has not topped the first 3 seasons before they were canceled. In fact the show has very much regressed. Fans aren't complaining because Family Guy is changing or evolving, we are complaining because the writing is poor and repeated. Family Guy now seems targeted to a typical 15 year old male audience. Volume 10 in particular had some of the least appealing episodes to me. And the only character growth we see is Lois becoming a horrible person. I use to see Lois as a matriarch of a dysfunctional family, but now she is mean and cruel for no real reason. You would think by not releasing seasons the volumes would be considerably cheaper. That is not the case by far. Anyone who cares about a decently written adult cartoon should switch over to American Dad."
3,Just Okay,"Family Guy has been of my husband's favorite shows for years. This of course means I have to watch it too. This type of slapstick humor isn't the type of show I would pick on my own, but it has its moments. I can always relate to the relationship with Stewey and his mother. I wonder sometimes if my son isn't trying the same things when I'm not looking. This season has a few glowing moments. There are fourteen episodes and lots of bonus footage. Mr. & Mrs. Stewey was probably my favorite episode in the collection. However, my husband and I both agree that the quality of the show has come down in the last few seasons. There is a lot of repetition and it just isn't as good as it used to be. That being said, its still worth the price and if you are a die hard fan like my husband, you won't want to miss out on this box set. Otherwise, you can probably wait to catch the reruns in syndication."
1,Instant video NOT season 10,"If anyone noticed there has been a mistake. The instant video that can be purchased on Amazon on this page is not Season 10. The description of Season 10 mentions 14 episodes and the Instant video is way more than that. If you plan on purchasing Instant video for certain shows DO NOT do it through Amazon.Season 10 episode list as such.Disk 1Halloween on Spooner StreetBaby, You Knock Me OutBrian Writes a BestsellerRoad to the North PoleNew Kidney in TownDisk 2And I'm Joyce KinneyFriends of Peter GGerman GuyThat Hand That Rocks the WheelchairTrading PlacesDisk 3Tiegs for TwoBrothers and SistersThe Big Bang TheoryForeign AffairsThe episodes listed for Instant purchase in Season 10 on this website is actually Season 9 episodes."
2,Stretching It.....,"I have been to Cuba many, many times and Tattlin's book caught me rolling my eyes a bit. She tends to stretch the truth to make the book more interesting, or rather, she gives an unrepresentative portrayal of Havana. Life in Cuba may not be mansions and BMW's, but if you want to see real poverty take a trip over to Haiti, the DR, etc. etc......the difference between Cuba and the rest of Latin America is that in Cuba even the rich white foreign people have to struggle. The books shows a lack of perspective and frequently is pompous."
3,Havana without it,"Last Christmas I send this book (Cuba Diaries...etc) to a friend from my office as a gift. Six months later we had an exchange on this book and we both agreed that it was poorly written. Isadora Tatlin is nothing but what the title of her book claims: An American housewife who happens to be of all places, in Havana. We understood the fact of her being just another fatty wife more concerned with taking their kids to the mall on Sunday than guiding them through the intricacies of life in a third world, more or less communist country. She failed to grasp the esence of life in Havana. In short she is, precisely, the best example of a our failed foreing policy toward the island."
1,Bleech!,"Truly is what it says it is: An American housewife whines about not getting fresh whatever daily from the servants. She could visit the south side of Chicago and whine, sans servants. Her Martha Stewart sensibilities are out of place in a poor country struggling with social issues, quite successfully, I would add, despite North America's stupid blockade.Needless to say, this book was an aggravation and disrespectful of another place and culture."
5,"Cuba, the Comedy and the Tragedy","I've never been to Cuba. But now I feel like I have been -- and in very good company. Isadora Tatlin is the funniest, most observant, writer. Her accounts of scrounging for food to serve her family, exploring the architecture of old Havana, attending the art exhibitions of dissident artists, are all detailed and droll and, at times, very touching. I really loved this book. I've already passed it on to one Cuban-American friend who agrees with me wholeheartedly. Tatlin's account of what it's like to have Fidel Castro to dinner -- for my money -- is a comic masterpiece."
3,Lost potential,"I picked up this book because as a cuban-american i was interested to find out how an american travelling to cuba would see the island, its people, its culture ... In this the author is vere effective she reccounts everything that she sees with such detail that at many points early on in the book i found myself laughing out loud. The proble is that she never ventures past this she only briefly hints at how this oppresive political system is perceived by the people and only once our twice hints at how it makes her feel. this book claims to be a diary kept by an american woman while she was living in cuba but i find it hard to believe that anyone would refrain from either criticizing or praising things in their own personal diary. Isadora had an opportunity to write a wonderful book and unfortunately simply reported back on things she saw with little power behind it."
2,Couldn't stay interested,"Just a day-to-day account that got to be a little boring. As far as I read there was no love of the country or the people that came through. I thought I wanted to go to Cuba, but now I don't think so."
2,Disappointed,"I read the first 30 pages of this memoir and put it down I was so bored. I know I can't give a fair review but I was so struck by a memoir that manages to convey no personal feelings or reactions. Cuba seems like a fascinating country and such a mystery. While the author's descriptions of, for example, the bizarre contents of the local grocery store actually were interesting, I wanted more than just a straight description. Not just the facts but the emotions and colors and general vibe of the country and how it FELT to live there. The author leaves herself so fully out of the story that it reads more like a dry description of everyday life that was censored by the Cuban government."
3,perhaps a little shallow,"I actually enjoyed reading this book. I felt that I learned something about Havana and life there.True, the author seemed somewhat shallow and self-centered. It was ""all about HER"" I even felt that she neglected her childen. Juana, the hired help seemed more fun and motherly.And life must have been very challenging under those circumstances. But I felt that the author was very petty and critical of the people around her.I cannot fault her for trying to live a priviledged life behind her walls and wire. I could recognize myself in some of her attitudes, unfortunately.So, she seemed an ordinary, somewhat shallow American woman in a difficult situation.But I did learn that Cubans call a bus or camion a gua gua - but I don't know why."
4,Good and inexpensive blades,"I use around 6 blades a year on my edger. These blades are inexpensive and work as well as the higher priced items. I thought the shipping was a little high but overall, since I purchase 10 at a time, the per item price was a little over $2 each."
2,"Actually, I did like it.","Very very campy, ot course. That's the point. But due to the low-budget, poor acting, silly script, etc. I could not possibly give it more than two stars."
1,Is everyone else working for the studio?,"This film is god-awful. Even for people with bad taste, would hate this. Proably the most horrific film of 2006. Terrible acting, direction is worse. Like most people, I couldn't finish this. It was so bad that I didn't care about the ending. Make sure you see this before buying it."
5,great workout,This workout is fast paced and very energetic. She has a good attitude and is very encouraging. Great moves you can pick up quickly.
3,"Way, way too many people in this DVD!","This is a good workout DVD and I do recommend it. However, there are so many people in this DVD. What is the need to have 2 giant men (plus one more) and 4 buffed up women (plus 2 more) in this DVD? It feels like 100 people in this DVD. It looks bit freakish like some sort workout demo in shopping mall."
4,Good workout,"I enjoyed this workout a lot more than the ""quick fix"" one. This is geared more toward intermediate exercisers. It was very easy to follow, and I broke a light sweat. Janis demonstrates how the moves can be made easier or more difficult. I think I will be feeling the squats tomorrow! Overall, a well made exercise dvd, just not super challenging for a cardio workout."
2,Boring and slow,Not very challenging at all. Music is low and out-dated. Moves are simple and slow. Not for someone who exercises regularly.
3,Not Great for Everyone,"I have been working out with Tae Bo and the gym for years. I have been looking for an alternative to the original Tae Bo advanced and have yet to find one that combines the full body workout and intesity that it provides. After reading the reviews here, I thought that I found it; but sadly I would say that it falls short on working abs and legs. Plus, the added weight on the hands are not good for your joints. This is more beginner then intermidiate or advanced and while her technique is good, it is not that challenging."
1,No good at 88mph,"I bought one of these so I could video chat when I'm travelling back to 2001. Unfortunately, when travelling, once the capacitor activated, the radiation from the 1.21 gigawatt flux dispersal fried the components in the camera. Perhaps I'll try again with a Mr. Fusion drive. If it fries again I can always sell it to a trank should their thumbprint process."
3,I've been happy with it,"This isn't any worldbeater, but if you just want to take some vain pictures of yourself and send the odd v-mail -- which is all I do -- this camera should be adequate. If you're looking for a video conferencing beastie, look elsewhere.The model I have is, evidently, the 33L4890, instead of the '89. I can't imagine there's much difference -- whichever one of IBM's camera's you pick, you won't get much support from Big Blue; it's outsourced to the hodgepodge of hardware and software developers who contributed to the package.If you don't expect too much, you'll be happy. If you need the damn thing to do as you tell it, spend more money."
2,Amazed this made it to market,"Well, the quality of the picture from IBM's line of PC cameras is decent enough, but the software that comes with it has all sorts of problems. There's a high probability you'll have to get updated software/drivers and serviceability instructions. The video drivers are very finicky; your own system setup (OS release, patches and software installed), number and type of other USB devices installed all contribute to possibilities of the software and camera not working together. Also, I don't know if this is typical for webcams, but there's a good 1/2 second to second delay between live action and what's show on the computer. This may or may not be important for your purposes. However, if you are able to get one of these cameras for dirt cheap (read: almost free), then as I said, the quality if it works is good enough to at least give it a shot."
1,Why was this camera made???,This Camera is terrible. The quality sucks and it barely worked. When tryin to have a video conference it would freeze up and mess up the whole program. Any amount of money is way too much to be asking for this garbage. DON'T BUY!!!!
1,Not worth the money...you could do better!,"I purchased the program origionally without doing my homework. At the time it was an 'ok' camera, but I would never buy another one like this. The reason that I purchased it is due to the 'stitcher' program (for making 360' Quicktime video files)that was bundled with it. ~ At the same time ""you get what you pay for"". Most people want a high quality camera, but don't feel the $110 (or more) for that technology is worth the price. Even so...it would be nice if these 'low end' cameras would do a better job."
2,There are better buys out there,"I received this IBM webcam free when I signed up for broadband with Cox. For FREE it's fine. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for even the shipping on it. It say's 30 FPS, but it doesn't keep up to even some slow hand clapping. Images are slow and grainy."
1,You get what you pay for....,"You would think IBM would put a little more quality into something they put their name on. This camera, is the worst I have ever owned or seen in use. When I could get the buggy program and drivers it came with to work, the image quality stunk. I would not recommend this product to anybody, it's a waste of time and money. Stick to a more reputable company like Logitech."
2,tried & returned!,"Video quality of this camera was extremely poor, no matter what lighting situation was tried. If you make a movement, you will see it seconds later instead seeing it as you are moving. Constant attempts for the camera to focus seem to be the problem--even trying to sit very still it did the same thing. Still photos looked better than a couple of other pc cameras I have tried, but only if you held your breath and absolutely DID NOT MOVE while taking picture. Have tried 3 other cameras in this price range, this has the worst video quality--extremely jittery and annoying, sort of like the old home movies we had in the 60's. Much better video performance can be had for same $$ or less. No trouble with installation, though!"
3,IBM PC Camera USB - 33L4889,"The camera itself works quite well with focus up to one foot from the object. The software that comes with unit is lacking. Even Microsoft's NetMeeting is more feature rich than what comes bundled. USB bandwidth is acceptable unless you use other high bandwidth devices like scanners or media drives during live video. Plan on scaling your frames and rate down if are multitasking. The hardware installed on all flavors of Microsoft Windows 95 and 98 and also worked on beta versions of upcoming Microsoft operating systems. You will not find this product on IBM's site, it is OEMed from another vendor. The same essential camera was offered to new subscribers of Earthlink but was the serial port version. This one suffered due to serial port bandwidth limitations."
1,a waste of money,"I have had nothing but problems with this camera. The manual focus doesn't add focus to anything, and it is difficult to get the light exactly right for the camera to work well. The program even caused my computer to crash due to major incompatibility problems. Xirlink Tech Support was of no help whatsoever - they don't even answer their phone (you have to call long distance and leave a message)."
1,piece of crap. not worth it!,when it's the cheap there bound to be something wrong. and there was. this is not a web cam. meaning you can't hook it up to a web page and broadcast it. it's for video conferencing one on one (netmetting). the pictures were just horrible. you see more of the nasty diffuse then you could see yourself. ...suggestion: i would purchase the intel pocket pc camera. this cam has clear pics. and is a webcam & digital cam.
5,You Can Start A Business Using This Book,"Not only has Building your Multi-Million-Dollar Practice offered fabulous advice to financial advisors (and if you follow the 8 Strategies, you should be successful), it also distills down for ANY small service business the things they need to do to stay in business. I often tell my clients to read this book and substitute in Small Business for Financial Advisor. Many of the tips offered in the book, like how to hire employees, how to let your customers know they are valued, and how to market your services are valuable to any small business.Even so, the perspective of this book is truly from knowledgeable authors who have vast experience working in and running a practice. I have read the book myself numerous times, have it all marked up, tabbed and more. I use this book as a Bible for running my management consulting practice, and I highly recommend it as excellent reading for any business trying to get their processes in place."
4,Excellent Practice Management Tool,This book was one I purchased only on the off chance that it would help build a practice as the title is a little sensational. However this book is helpful for all financial planning practices regardless of size and stage of development.
1,If you really want to make money in the financial service ind.,Write a book marketed towards struggling financial advisors which is just a commercial for your registered/trademarked strategies and coaching services. The authors should have given the book away rather than trying to disguise their services as a way to build a multi million dollar advisory business. Neither author has any experience as financial advisor. There are better books written by actual advisors in the business.
2,look good but..............,They went on fairly easily but after a short while they would turn and catch on things. If they would stay in place it would be great.
3,errr,"Interestingly, if you look at the reviews of 'How to survive and prosper as an artist' you will see that Gilli Moon has recomended her own book as an alternative. That's a bit questionable isn't it?"
5,"Love, Love, Love this","This is great music. This happens to be my second copy of this album, since the first one was damaged. As I reviewed on the first one,the songs are full of variety showing off INXS's many talents. ""Afterglow"" is my favorite. I think the group has a great new lead singer that can't replace Michael Hutchence but can certainly take the group to the next level.Buy and enjoy over and over again."
3,"A nice try, but no cigar","A far cry from ""the mighty 8th"", this game while fun for a while, seems watered down for the kids."
4,the game,"This game was pretty good.I thought that it was going to be bad but it was actually pretty good, the levels were just a little to easy though. Overall it was good. I recomend that you shoud buy this game.I was getting bored of my nintendo ds and then i bought this game and now i play it all the time. When you play the game over agian you don't even realize the difference from when you first played it the first time. You got to do everything, shoot the planes, fly the plane, drop the bombs, everything. The only thing I have agianst the game is that you fly solo and not with other planes. Its awesome, still buy it."
5,KB and Lil Flea of Street Military.,"This album is dope but the self titled one is even better becuase it has an extra song called ""The Dope"". Like the people above me say these Street Military boys are on another level yall boys out Htown and Texas need recognize who bring the real [stuff] Yall should check out the South Park Coalition website where you can talk to other fans of Street Military and the South Park Coalition and KiLLa KLan rap cliques."
2,too west coast.......,just listened to it real quick sounds like the newer sauve house write b4 8ball & mjg left too freakin west coast man uahh...
5,Great music that really makes you appriciate AFI,"This album really shows off AFI's songwriting talents because it strips down the melodies to classical instruments, and it is performed beautifully. A must for any AFI fan or Classical, almost Opera-esque listener"
2,bird feeder 464-4,"This was not expected, we were so excited that we bought this, and after waiting for such a long time for this feeder to arrive we were very disappointed to find out that the birds are not attracted to it at all! forget feeding from it they don't even look at it we would not recommend buying this unless your birds are used to this type of a feederany other feeding suggestions welcome!"
3,Nothing wrong with the feeder...,"except that it has not attracted any finches! I use to use thistle socks and goldfinches would flock to them. But it got expensive to replace them twice a month. So I bought this feeder, filled it with nyjer, and nothing... even the House finches aren't attracted to it. They haven't even sat on it."
2,Same as man/info pages?,Every reference to a command appears to be a direct quote from Linux man pages or the info pages. If those were clear enough I wouldn't need a reference! The good thing about this book is that it does organize commands based loosely on what they do.
3,An expert's book,"Linux - Essential Reference AUTHOR: Ed Petron PUBLISHER: New Riders REVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: This is a book for anyone who knows what Linux is all about but may need help in how to do it. Since the first page contains an explanation of HOW to interpret what you are reading, you better know Linux inside and out before trying to use this book. If you want to learn Linux, Linux - Essential Reference is definitely not your cup of tea.The Book includes: an 11-page Content, a 38-page Index and the print is very small. There are no tips or notes in the margins to assist you with the material presented. Be sure to have a good light and knowledge of Linux before buying this book."
4,Very handy the only reference book you will need,This book is very handy to resolve problems you will face while using linux. I have tried various other books but this was the best so far. It is well worth to spend small amount of money for very handy and useful knowledge. Order it.
2,This Biography Takes Too Many Short Cuts,"I'm glad I didn't purchase this DVD. Only some brief widescreen glimpses of the coming-soon ""Buffalo Bill..."" got a rise out of me. The big disgrace is the obscenely short amount of time devoted to ""Nashville""--and awful pan-and-scan footage at that! And the other, lesser-known films are relegated to still photos and Cinema 101 Narrator. It's always fascinating to see the old guy comment on the ""Gingerbread Man"" controversy, but I'm not sure that Mr. Altman would be too pleased with a program that barely mentions his own (admitted) favorite ""Kansas City.""Worst of all, the ""filmography"" lists a movie called ""Secret HARBOR"" from 1984. Where do I send my resume?"
1,What a disappointment!,"This book gives new meaning to the expression ""false advertising."" Most of the homes run between 1800 and 2100 sq. ft.(hardly ""small""), and there are very, very few homes in the 1200 sq. ft. range. Amazon should either drop this book from its list altogether or include a disclaimer."
4,An excellent Atlas Identification,Este atlas en una excelente guia de identificación para hidrobiologos que se dedican a la evaluación de los sistemas de tratamiento de aguas residuales a través de la presencia de ciertas comunidades de plankton.
4,good pictures,The book has very good pictures and brief descriptions of many wastewater organisms that I regularly observe in my system. No other book that I've seen is as useful for identifying organisms.
3,Good kit,"about the same price as the store just didnt want to have to go search for it somewhere, have all the kits from api."
1,API Not Accurate!,I have been using an API Calcium Test Kit to test water in a reef tank.As the test kit began to be depleted I ordered a new one of the same test kit.Too my surprise where as the first kit indicated 380ppm the second indicated 520ppm.Same test performed within mins using two API Calcium Test kits!Shame on API for selling such poor products!
1,Missing Product!,"I ordered this product online because where I live there is no place to get saltwater test kits. When I received the kit, it only had one test bottle in it! Very disappointed, this mistake put me back a week on my aquarium set up."
4,"Great book, not so great pictures",I bought this book as well as 3 others on knife making from Amazon. This book is good for if you have some decent tools and even has a section for doing it all with hand tools. The major complaint and only reason I gave it 4/5 is because about half of the pictures are way to dark. You can hardly see what is going on with them. If they were lighter with more contrast it would have been better. The other pictures are fine. Overall I am still glad I bought the book and would recommend it for a beginning knife maker.
5,This is the bible of knifemaking!,"Now into its 8th printing, this book is an invaluable guide to anyone who has ever wanted to know how knives are made. Detailed are the thoughts and methods of two of knifemaking's greatest craftsmen: Bob Loveless and Bill Moran. Great pictures, masterful advice, and clear explainations make this the best book you can buy about the craft of making knives. More than any other, this book convinced many of today's successfull makers to turn on a grinder."
5,A great starter manual for the new and older knife maker.,"This book is very easy to read, the photos are excellent. If you're looking for an introduction to stock removal and forging this is a must have for any knife makers library."
2,how to make knives,"If you want to make knives with modern tools this is a good book to buy. Alo if you want to smith a blade using old techniques this book has little information to learn how. The chapter on forging gives a vage view on makeing one kind of simple blade ,and even then the author still talks about useing modern equipment. Even in the chapter on makeing knives in a modern shop he only desribes one kind of knife. Which was a single edged simple blade. He never mentioned in the entire book anything about throwing knives or more egzodick knives such as parrying dagger with moving parts. Infact he never mentioned a simple dager or dirk. Even in how vage the book is and leaves you with many questions about many other kinds of knives this would be a good book for someone who wants to make hunting knives or other simple blades."
2,How to Make Knives,"This could have been a great book except for one thing. Obviously the publishers did not care enough when updating this book to update or even take the time to use quality photo's in their book. I would like to see what is going on in the book but most of the photo's are so awful you can only see shades of grey and black. To let all this effort by Loveless go to waste is a shame!Save your money and buy an older version, one that hopefully has clear and quality photo's so you will know what R.W.Loveless is building or what step he is using.The book itself is a great instructional tool. However you just can't get all that Loveless has to offer in this new version because you can not make out many of the photo's."
2,Bad Pictures -- A real shame,"This book was listed on a number of Forums as a must buy for a new knife maker. So I bought it and just finished reading it. The text is really good. The pictures are terribly reproduced Black and White photos. On about 70-80% or so, they are just gray blobs. You can't tell anything about the photo. This is bad for a guy like me who is trying to figure out the basics. The book is meant to be a Photo book with explanations of the photos. Each photo is numbered, and each text block refers the the numbered photo. REALLY disappointing. The text is good and if the photos were useful, the book would be a five for sure.,"
2,"Not for me, probably not for you","I am a do-it-yourselfer and like to read books and then attempt to do the things described. I have had a lot of success with this.This book is not for people like me. If you want an interesting history of knifemaking or a who's -who of knifemaking, read this book. If faithfully describes tools and techniques that are very unlikely to be used successfully by the novice. The final insults are the lack of updating and the poor quality of the illustrations.There are better texts out there for the serious knifemaker. For the novice, this book is next to useless. Its niche seems to be for the history buff."
1,not recommended,"This is AWFUL. The style, color and look is great but it was way too large and heavy for my head. This wig is very heavy and not deep enough to keep it on my head. The sides and back also don't cover my head. Even with a wig cap, this didn't work. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a...large head? I was really upset that I couldn't use this for my costume and had to send it back."
1,Not Worth It.,"I purchased this for a halloween costume, it looks absolutely nothing like the picture. It resembles more of an Annie wig than Lucy. Let's say, I tried it on, tried to play with it to make it work, threw it away and made a new costume."
2,cute but way too small,the wig itself is really cute and very true to color. we were dissappointed that it was so small! this was not big enough for an adult wig. we rechecked the package to make sure we didn't get a child's wig. nope! it stated adult size! hope they see this and make a size change:)
2,Not what I expected,"I got this wig to wear with a costume of Lucy in the candy factory. The wig was the right color but I ended up unable to wear it. There is a ton of hair, especially in the back, so there was no way i could wear a chef's hat on top. Plus the sides of the wig, where the hair is brushed back away from your face, were shaped oddly so that the wig lining always showed. It looked like a cheap wig, which I admit it was."
2,Don't Spend a Penny on this DVD,"This movie is bad: bad writing, bad acting, and especially, bad direction. It's a shame, because, with the exception of the lead actor(no charisma, no looks, no actor's instinct, no interest), I believe the other actors could have made a much better film if given a better script and/or a much better director. As I watched, I thought, these actors could have made a better movie if the director had given them broad story sketches and allowed them to improvise dialogue and action. What I saw was unnatural dialogue, action, and re-action. This movie stinks.My experience with Film Movement is that their films are hit and miss. Many of them are wonderful, others, such as ""Helena From The Wedding"" are real stinkers. The idea of the movie is good, but the execution is a waste of talent and film. I would have given it 1.5 stars, so my two stars are generous."
1,90 minutes I'll never get back,"This film is SLOW to say the least. The couples are disfunctional and complain to the newlyweds about the horrors of marriage. I kept watching hoping the plot would develop and it would get better but that never happened. The film makers missed every opportunity to make this a good flick...from the hunting scene, to the ride into town to get cigs (the only two scenes not shot in the cabin)."
4,Judith,"This is a great book that looks at how a woman is lost in a society that only prides itself on economical gain. Judith is a character who is searching for her morality but is blinded by societies values without having an oportunity to see the negative aspects of it. While making decisions that could have serious effects on her future, she is unable to fully understand her choices and makes them without analysis her goals. This is a book that deals with a person's moral blindness and how they have to cope with making choices without fully comprehending their decision."
2,The quality doesn't match the price,"Not happy with the purchase. IMO, the quality is not good. They are too thin, and look sort of empty (I guess I can't find a better way to put it) They look worn out after a few uses."
2,Unbalanced unfortunately,"I picked this for our wedding. Unfortunately they are not well-balanced and fall off the plate often. The tine end of the fork is not heavy enough. I like these a lot, but I wouldn't buy another set."
1,Boring movie,"I had high expectation when I saw this in the theater. However, it was a boring movie. It is supposed to be a Black Comedy, but I just didnt enjoy.Dont waste your money."
1,"HOLLYWOOD WON'T SUPPORT WAR,BUT WILL BE SUPPORTED BY WAR.","I have always hated the hypocrisy of making a profit from an unpopular war by making satirical and clever movies on the subject.Hollywood has done more to glorify war and violence than any other group in the history of mankind,and should not be poking fun at their bread and butter.(It was a good depiction of some of the war's craziness)"
1,damaged goods,i ordered this dvd as a gift for my daughter. it arrived in pieces. thanks a lot. what a waste of $$. i should have just gone to best buy.
2,A bit of Rubbish and not original,"Maybe I didn't like it because it was the last movie I saw in a three film-movie marathon but come on!The first ten minutes looks like a lot of fun, a few laughs and a bit of action is great. But then the director(some hollywood hotshot)tries to be classic with a piece of cinematography in a gun fight scene-Slow motion views in silence with only the sound of the bullets' impact and the victims...""AH"" After this stupid and not called for piece of film I took little interest in the rest of the pathetic little film. I have not previewed the DVD version yet. But, I know that I will like on DVD-only through the features side of it. Worth watching...just."
2,Waste of time,"A terrible movie with a plot so full of holes I found myself laughing at all the wrong parts while feeling sick at the same time. The action was mediocre at best, the acting was decent for such poorly written characters, though the actors really didnt do much to make their own characters interesting. Id skip this title, there are alot better movies out there to waste your money on."
4,Worth checking out,"Over-all this movie wasn't the greatest...I originally rented it because of Ice Cube - I've liked a lot of his films in the past. I think it captured the feel of the Gulf War (the media blitz, the frat party mentality of the soliders once the war was over). I also respected the way the arab people were portrayed - stuck in the middle between Americans who want to help and their own pro-Sadaam countrymen. I thought it dragged a little...I started paying bills around the time Mark Wahlberg was getting resuced. But it is worth a view if you have the time. I also like the extras that the DVD offered... a lot more interesting - in depth - then other releases. Besides the DVD quality - this is the reason why DVD is great."
5,"Tour de force ... ""but ...""","Without a doubt one of the sharpest, funniest, thought provoking, emotionally wrenching, and (hey, there's no shame) fast and furious action films to emerge from a major studio in many a moon. And another good reason to not watch the oscars next year. The DVD transfer perfectly captures Newton Thomas Sigel's stark, daring and much commented upon cinematography for the smaller (letterboxed and enchanced) screen at home; and watch your speakers with that awesome 5:1 sound - or at least warn the neighbors. However... I've experienced difficulty in accessing the special feature functions on more than one copy of this disc. According to a WB home vid. rep some consumers experienced similar difficulty with early DVD copies of THE MATRIX. I'm waiting to hear from another rep via e-mail. Anyone else have that problem? In the meantime ... crank it up and prepare for a visceral, emotional and intellectual ride."
4,Looks are the Key,"It's amazing to me to see a film on my television screen look almost as good as it did in the theater. ""Three Kings"" was was shot in such a flawless manner and it really shows through on the DVD. I think all DVD's should be layed out like this. There is the film, in widescreen format, a documentary about the making of it, audio tracks with the director and the producers, and special links to go with the website. DVD's are for people who are avid about films, and when you invest in one, you should get a little more that you expect. With ""Three Kings"" I did."
2,What?,"When I saw this movie at a pre-screening at my college movie theater (Tulane), I was extremely unimpressed. After seeing Fight Club, American Beauty, and Man on the Moon, I was ready for some inventive filmaking. I love Spike Jonze's work, but the plotline was so horribly weak. I found myself wanting to get up and walk out. It was such a done once.. done again movie. This movie brought relatively nothing new to the table (including the ""black hole sun"" shot of the three main characters after they steal the gold). Good compilation, great premise, but very poor execution. Try making me think next time.."
3,Not near as good as what some people are saying,"The movie wasn't too bad but I didn't like the Directing and/or editing at all.Rent, Don't Buy is my recommendation."
3,GOOD FOR WHAT IT IS,"For a movie that's supposed to NOT be trivializing war, that's exactly what it does. It's very glib, and lacks anything like an emotional punch. For that you need to see ""The Thin Red Line"" or ""Full Metal Jacket."" Even ""Apocolypse Now"" has been where this has been, and decades earlier. That's not to say the movie isn't funny and on occassion visually stylistic, but that makes it very good, not great. In this age of Music Video influenced directors, maybe that's the best we can hope for."
3,"Don't like Clooney, what are you Looney?","Sorry about the title, Three kings was not a movie I chose to see on the big screen. My wife recommended it and I found it was an entertaining flick. Not a desert storm movie like Jar Heads, a different take on an old story line."
3,Not Another War Movie,"George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and director Spike Jonze (who gives a chance at acting here) star in this twisted, offbeat war movie where four american soldiers try to survive in Iraqi while searching for some gold hidden by Saddanm`s army.The plot mixes a bit of everything, going from drama, dark comedy, action and satire, and while it isn`t always sucessful it still works for the most part (the ending, however, could be much more surprising). It`s certainly unconventional and dares to try something different, which is something rare nowadays, especially in the tired war movie genre.Director David O. Russel offers an experimental, dazzling cinematography, creating some unique and weird visual scenes. Although the mix between a serious and an absurd tone doesn`t work as well as it could, ""Three Kings"" is nonetheless an interesting picture worth watching, making for an entertaining and innovative trip."
2,Unnecessary bad language and violence,"The opening 30 minutes has unnecessary bad language, gratuitious violence that does not contribute to the story. Dim view of military personnel behavior. The bad language continues throughout the film but after the first 30 or so minutes, the story line kicks in and it gets more watchable - still B grade stuff though. I'm putting the disk on the auction block."
3,Not the greatest movie ever made (sorry),"I want to give you Amazonians a more balanced view of this film. I disagree that this is ""Desert Storm's Platoon"". This movie impressed me by tackling some moral issues surrounding the conflict in Iraq/Kuwait as well as issues surrounding war itself. But the issues are not developed very fully and the comedic aspect of the film overshadows and takes away from that development. Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, etc. didn't make a comedy out of themselves. I think the comedy hurt the film. In addition I thought that the story wasn't all that original. You have the anti-hero archtypes in the three leads who end up in the end making the right choice. (We haven't seen that one before). If somebody asked me if I liked this movie I would say ""Yes."" but I would not give it a five. I give it a high 3, pretty average."
2,"Great ideas, poor execution","There is much that is both right and wrong with this film. It's extremely funny, well acted, and has some very intelligent things to say about war and its effects on people on both sides-- during the first half of the movie. But midway through it loses track of what it wanted to be, or maybe didn't ever know at all. What starts as a condemnation of gung-ho Rambo warhawk mentality then turns into exactly that: a gung-ho Rambo action movie with people outrunning bullets and explosions and knocking down choppers with explosive-laced footballs. But you're not supposed to notice this is happening because the characters are doing it for ""good"" reasons, and are supposed to laugh as the ""bad guys"" die by the dozens. The intelligence and wit and irony built up at the start all goes up in a big explosion, and then gets wrapped up in an all too convenient, simple conclusion-- a tragic waste of an inherently complex, interesting premise."
2,Three Kings,"I'm sorry but I didn't find this movie entertaining or believable. It did not have near the entertaining value of Kelly's Heroes. I did not see any talent in the script or the actors. I believe that George Clooney surrounds himself with no name and no talent actors in most of his movies because he is afraid that good actors may show how little talent he has. The redeeming factor is that a neighbor loaned the movie to me, therefore saving me wasting money to buy it. I gave it two stars out of pity. Sudami"
2,overrated,I PERSONALLY FOUND THREE KINGS VERY AVERAGE INDEED.I BOUGHT THE FILM BECAUSE IT WAS WELL REVIEWED AND TO MY MIND THE CRITICS MUST BE ON THE FILM COMPANY PAYROLL.
3,Off on the wrong foot,"If you like your movies to start out with a vulgar and unnecessary sex scene that has nothing to do with the story, then I suppose you will feel quite comfortable with the rest of this film. I, however, felt insulted by this deliberately gratuitous opener. It tended to affect my receptivity toward everything that was to come. I saw none of the much-vaunted humor promised by the promotional hype and could only half-believe that these diamond-in-the-rough treasure-hunter anti-heroes would end up transformed into ""angels with dirty faces"" and hearts of gold. In brief, I can't recommend this film to earnest anti-war protesters - nor nuns."
1,Why? Why did I watch the whole thing?,"I have see many movies in my time and have like, loved and hated them. This one is 100% on my hate list. I just can't believe I watched the entire movie. I think that somewhere in my inner mind I thought it might get better as it went on. I was very wrong. This movie could have lasted 5 hours and that still wouldn't be enough time to recoup from it's horrible movie writing. Like so many movies people wasted their time on, this one has a popular actor in it. ""George keep your day job on ER or please be more selective with the projects you take on."" If your just in to people in the movie and you are a die hard Clooney fan buy it! You can watch him and try and talk yourself into liking the movie. If your a serious movie watcher and don't have time to spare on bad movies, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!"
1,Was this a sequel to the Blair Witch Project?,"Some big name actors here and yet its filmed in the desert.Not surprising really,after paying George Clooney for this movie they must of ran out of money for the plot and to pay the other actors.Did I say there were other actors?Sad story is i paid for this movie about some losers looking for gold bullion,the plot was okay if they would of ended it there.Markey Mark didnt help the story abit though.I rated this a 1 because the actors showed up to shoot this.was it worth 2 hours.I would rather be kicked in the face with a frozen muckaluck then have to watch this over."
4,Why do they do that?,"Caveat Emptor !! This was an excellent movie, but one should be forewarned; this DVD is a ""difficult"" DVD, kind of like ""The Matrix."" Many DVD players have problems decoding them for some reason. This problem occurs most often with Warner Bros. DVD's, Three Kings being one of them.I wouldn't let this stop me from buying, but the pauses in the movie while the player decodes get tiresome."
5,"a bizarre satire, but in no way a pathetic hero war movie","If you expect a normal hollywood war movie, with ""john wayne"" alike heroes, spectacular action and sexy violence, you can't be more wrong. The filming technique is very disturbing, you fell uncomfortable, and this is good so, because this is a film about a war, and you should not feel comfortable in a war. For example there are only one dozen bullets shot, but you really care about every single bullet. In the overdriven satiric moments, this film reminded me very much of MASH and Apocalypse Now. Also this film makes clear, that the usa didnt fight the gulf war because they care for the people, it was only for oil! Very impressing was the toture scene, which made clear, irak peaople are humans, and no diabolic monsters. This is by no way a right wing phantasie, as someone stated earlier. Maybee the most important war movie of the 90's."
4,Why we fight Why we feel,"Is it for honor? Is it for glory? Is it for money? Perhaps it is for all three of these reasons. This film reminded me of THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY except the three in the title were all GOOD. The backdrop of the film is war. The motivating factor is greed and lust. Through the transgression of man's ability to commit war, humanity surfaces in the most unlikely places and at the most unlikely times. Even though this film looks more offbeat every time I watch it, it seems to make greater sense with each viewing."
4,"Well acted, comical, touching...","This movie, in parts, reminded me very much of a Kurt Vonnegut book. It is highly political and in many ways, a satire with a cell phone call to the US and the inside of a body that has just been shot being two of many notable Vonnegut like examples. However, it is also a touching story of 3 ordinary men and what they do when put into a situation of getting an amazing amount of wealth. It is also interesting because it is one of the few Gulf War movies to hit the mainstream. On top of that, the performances by George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze (as well as a slew of supporting characters) are well acted and believible. You not only like the men, you truly can identify with the very human choices they make even when almost all of us have never been and will never be in a even remotely similar situation. I think that is a mark of a good movie. A must see!"
1,wanna be everything,"Three kings is that kind of movie that has ambitions to be everything. A realistic war-epos, a fun comedy and a ""condemn the US government"" work. It failes totally in with every ambition. The movie starts with a funny and comic dialogue and ends with a sentimental ""10 years later"" review. You ends up as a big questionmark."
1,In two words this movie is intended to be an anti Bush satire.,The whole point of the movie is anti-Iraq War and anti-Bush. Oh and some gratuitous lust--that was another part. It was so on the nose with the anti-Bush rhetoric and bias that I laughed out loud.
1,Is it me?,I realize my tastes are different than the average film goer but this is bizarre. This movie is horrid. It has no plot development. The special effects are juvinile and unrealistic. The acting was phoned in. The theme is cliche. Worse of all....and believe me I tried to see past this......is the right wing -America is great -Sadam is Hitler - blak blah blah....this is a propaganda film supporting our war on Iraq; thats the sad part that no one ever mentions that when they write about this horrible movie.
1,Things Kings of Yuck,"I was so bored at this movie. I bought it to see what George Clooney was like. He cannot act. He's in unfamiliar territory in this movie, trying hard. I have friends at work that act better."
1,Uneven and trivial,"This film didn't know what it wanted to be: a social commentary, a drama, an action adventure, or a comedy. Because of its lack of focus, it does none of the above, and actually becomes a bit of a bore. Mark Wahlberg does a fine job with a pathetic script, but the rest of the actors barely earn their pay. Nora Dunn is mildly amusing as the Christiane Amanpour character. Skip it, there's a lot better things to do with your time."
2,Uhh...bad plot.,...A movie about awol american soldiers who decide to go after iraqi gold before returning home after the gulf war. A taxing inner struggle between aiding the civilians of an enemy nation and taking the gold makes for an impressively parched storyline. 115 minutes grows tortuously long.
2,"Ouch, my ears!","I have been a military wife for 8 years and I have never heard such language in my life. I asked my husband if soldiers really talked like that on deployment and he answered an emphatic no. Of course there are the usual swear words, but the way these soldiers acted is expressly against any military code no matter what branch of the service you may be in. I thought this movie was demeaning as well as impossible. It was a total loser flick."
2,Very ordinary...,"This was a critically lauded film, so when I went in, I had high expectations. Roger Ebert himself called it a masterpiece. I saw it, and it was certainly interesting, but I immediately forgot about it right after I left the theater. There really isn't much depth here. It's more reminiscent of getting a quick rush from something, then after it wears off, you don't even remember how you felt afterwards. I remember a scene where a cow is blown up, but other than that, it's hard for me to remember anything about it. It ultimately was very ordinary, and not a really deep film about war."
2,One of the biggest letdowns of 1999.......,"I had wanted to see Three Kings ever since I saw the trailer at the cinemas, and I was very angry when I missed it. When it eventually came on video, I was highly disappointed. The story movies way to fast, and the way it was filmed was boring, ugly and hard to watch. And the really disappointing thing was, such a great cast, and a good director, but a failure film. The cast is brilliant, but there performances make them look like they are playing Barbie dolls, not heroes. If you want a big disappointment, and a torture, see Three Kings. Otherwise...."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I saw this on the big screen about 2 months ago. I disliked it then and I dislike it now. In all honesty, I felt that it tried very hard to be everything you expect from an action movie and failed. The fighting scenes were too violent for a 'comedy', which is what it seemed to be lacking. What is true about it is that it can't be catergorised for the simple fact that there's just too much going on and none of it is good enough to sustain real interest. It's a guy's film. My boyfriend loved it, I didn't, and that just about sums it up. For all you movie fans out there, your time and money would be better spent on such new masterpieces as 'The Matrix'."
3,Good if you have 2 hours to kill,"Anytime I see a rap star in the cast of a movie I almost always think the movie will be a throw-away. Three Kings is actually pretty good though. The acting isn't bad and the plot is interesting enough. Of course, there is a lot of cheese in this move but the cliches and one-liners are few so that helped.Given that the cast turned me off and I'm not an action movie guy - this isn't so bad. Give it a try."
2,This movie took a turn for the worst.,"The movie starts out kind of strangely and then goes on a rollercoaster ride that I didnt particularly enjoy. For starters I didnt really want to see George Clooney in the first 10 minutes of the movie having sex with some reporter. Now I will be emotionally scarred for life. Secondly its alot of fun! Going through an ultra realistic depiction of the Gulf War... Until... Things start to get serious.Suddenly the movie switches gears and the team wants to go out on a mission from god to save people being threatended by Saddam Hussein. Members on the team are killed and one gets captured and tortured. I didnt pay my money at the theater for a drama, but thats what this turns into halfway through. Lots of crying and deep religious and spiritual issues are faced which I dont really care for since I have enough drama and religious issues I face in real life. If this movie had kept on its free quest full of adventure, humor, danger and excitement I wouldve loved this."
4,"Very Stylish, Very Fun","I loved this movie. It was stylish, smart, and very, very funny. Some of the technical accomplishments are stunning, especially considering this is the director's first film. It has the feel of something done by a master of the medium. The Director obviously understands the medium thoroughly.My only fault is the excessive swearing, and the gratuitous sex scene at the beginning. Neither were necessary to advance the story. There were also a couple of hole in the plot, especially concerning the female reporter who is chasing Clooney's bunch through the desert.I laughed out loud, and it's a rare movie that can make me do that!This film confirms my opinion that George Clooney is a Hollywood Treasure."
3,"Great movie, but a headache to watch...","OK, so I thought the story was great and the acting was pretty good, but I started getting a headache with the strobe lighting in the first 5 minutes. I just think they went a little too artsy with the camera angles, color and light. All the movement just gave me a headache and almost distracted me from the plot itself. I have to admit though, that it did keep my interest throughout the movie, despite that. But, if they had just played it straight I would have given it a 5."
1,Not entertainment.,"I found this movie to be lacking in entertainment value. Theviolence and gore were excessive, gratuitious, and the only point tothis emotionally abusive experience for the audience. The film's only memorable moments depicted, in graphic horrible detail and in front of their loved ones, the murder of the only characters for whom the audience could generate any sympathy."
1,Completely unrealistic war movie,"This movie is based on the Gulf War. The acting is of extremely poor quality. The story plot is non-existent. The movie is about three U.S Marshals who intend to steal a large sum of gold. The surprising and very unrealistic thing about this story is that the three marshals get past top Iraqi security then into an underground lair full of armsmen without a sing bullet being fired. They even steal the gold from the iraqis in front of them with only two shots fired between at least two dozen men.To cut it short this movie is PATHETIC. It is way toooo patriotic, and seems to lack any plot whatsoever. Please don't make the mistake I made of watching this movie and wasting my time."
3,"Rent, don't buy!","I thought the movie would be a lot like the trailer I saw. Boy, was I disappointed! The first ten minutes are really lively and you get the sense that you might be watching ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off in Iraq""; by the time you realize you're bogged down in a philosophical diatribe about assisting Iraqi rebels...it's too late. Not the satire I thought it would be."
5,"Catch-22, Slaughter House 5, and M.A.S.H. in the Gulf","This story will be told over and over again, yet it will always be relevant. War is hell, the military is a bunch of brain-dead morons, and America will do whatever it needs to do to protect its interests."
3,I wanted to love it,"I rented this and truly wanted to love it. What I got was something of a disappointing film. Now before I say ANYTHING let me tell you this. I appreciate and respect this film. I think it's infussion of humour and war horror and action and other things is superb, it works. What doesn't work is the conflict, the characters and the situations. Unless you know a great deal about the gulf war I doubt you could be transported by this movie. It simply leaves too much unexplained, and a dissatisfying taste in your mouth. REPEATED viewings will reveal it's genius, but on the first viewing, prepare to be somewhat bored. P.S. The DVD is great, it rivals the miramax Collectors Edition DVD's and The Abyss as far as extras are concerned. ATTENTION WARNER BROTHERS! Please put this much non-DVD-Rom material into the Matrix!"
5,Top Notch DVD,"A remarkable film. You never know what's going to happen next, and that's always a pleasure.The camera work and editing are absolutely stunning.This wasn't the ""scathing indictment"" of US foreign policy in the Gulf War that the critics would like you to believe. Sure, the criticisms of the US policy are there (and rightly so)- but director David Russell has painted practically everyone in the same light: opportunists who are looking after their own self-interests.Those that complain that this isn't a war movie, is badly shot, lacks good action, and isn't ""realistic enough"" have totally missed the point.The DVD is incredible. Extras extras extras. There's a lot for you money here."
3,A DVD review,"A very thoughtfully produced DVD. The commentary by writer/director David Russell is very good, giving insight into what he was thinking. His `video' journal was short and mainly covered pre-production and the premiere. The `making of' documentary was excellent and covered the whole production of the film. The commentary from the producers especially Chuck Roven was too verbose. They mainly talk about money, casting and other production issues that I've never found that interesting or entertaining. The deleted scenes were okay and you don't gain much to the story although they do explain Conrad Vig's weird gun. The rest of the extras are just added features to the documentary and was just a bit too much. A very good DVD to have in your collection if you like the film. Otherwise, not worth it for the DVD features alone."
5,Alot of Action and Eplosion just fantastic!,I enjoy watching George Clooney he is just great! A lot of action in this movie. I really enjoyed the movie.
5,One of the top five of 1999!,"A smart and funny war film that shows you don't have to be unoriginal to tell a war story. I think that Speilberg's Saving Pvt. Ryan is a poor film because it's dialogue and character development lack any realism and originality, this film however has those qualities in abundance. Great acting all around, a smart script and unflinching direction, this film is very creative. In what could have been a typical war film director David O. Russell adds the reality and intelligence of a world that has become completely commercial. In doing so the story becomes new and fun. It's one part action, one part drama and one part comedy and amazingly they all work."
2,Pretty Lame,"This movie was pretty boring for an action flick. It starts off ok, and the first hour or so is entertaining, and then it just goes completely downhill. The special effects are pretty good, and there is some intrigue, but it's not enough. If you do not expect much, you may like it."
5,A different kind of war movie,"This is the first big budget movie about the Gulf War, and it is very well done. The look and feel of this movie is very different to any other movies that i have seen. I'm not going to use a lot of big words that no one understands, which i remember seeing when the first reviews were coming out last year. This movie is just cool to watch. The addons for the dvd are quite informative and really add value to the dvd. This would be a great dvd to have in your collection."
1,Gore and more,"I bought this DVD because the intellengia kept rating it five stars. If you like seeing a woman shot in the head, with the blood and guts coming out the other side - it's for you. If you like to see a six-inch needle planted into a man chest - it's for you. If you like to see depicted what happens to your internal organs when your shot - it's for you. Can we expect later some snuff scenes ""for authenticity""? The supposedly important woman reporter cried when she saw birds covered with oil - but thought nothing of bodies lying all around her. The story is incoherent. The translations of Arabic to English at the bottom the screen don't stay long enough to be read. If have been disappointed with other movies that I've bought but this one went where it deserved - in the trash can."
1,Not a Favorite,I wasn't too impressed with this movie. It just reminded me of a bunch of kids running around playing Army.Writer at BellaOnline
1,I DON'T UNDERSTAND...,"-Where is the war? (I thought it was a war movie)-Where is the humour?-Where is the originality?Someone please explain, i'm sure I must have missed something."
1,What a Bomb!,"I almost fear it's unfair of me to review the movie, because I couldn't watch too much of it. The language was unbearable. If you give stars each time a profanity is used, this movie is for you. I'm no prude, but this is ridiculous!"
1,"What a cliched mess...funny, no","I saw nothing of value here. Cliches are rampant, ideas and plot stolen from some pretty great films, and just where was it funny?"
3,Loud shoot-em-up,"Post Gulf War tale of three US soldiers who plan a heist of Kuwait gold stolen by Saddam. Quick cutting makes for quick action. The morality at the center is the meat of the movie. Clooney is pretty good, and Ice Cube is the new Jim Brown. Less overall than it could have been. Filmed in Arizona, but pretty convincing scenery."
3,I expected more...,"Heard all the great reviews on the movie. So I figured if it is that great I won't rent it I'll want to own it, so I bought it. The 5.1 Digital surround is great if you have the sound system. The bullets actually richochet around the room. The plot was boring, you knew how it would end 30 minutes into the film. This is one of those movies that you can wait till its on HBO."
3,PRETTY DECENT,"THREE KINGS was much better than you would think given the premise of ""lost Kuwait gold"" and the eclectic casting of Clooney; Cube; Marky Mark-Diggler and Spike Jonz-Coppola. The acting was very good(Wahlberg has developed into a fine actor-thank God he stopped rapping!) and the story had enough twists to keep itoriginal and realistic. It will probably go down as THE Persian Gulf ""war"" movie (if that means anything). It isn't, in my opinion, the greatest film since sliced bread as some critics have stated, but it is very good and worth 1 hour and 55 minutes of your life."
2,"More ""Hard to Swallow""","This is an addendum to my previous comments about the lack of realism in the movie...A Staff Sergeant is not called ""Chief""... Map locations in the army are given with alphanumeric gridzone designators which typically consist of 2 letters followed by 4, 6, or 8 numbers (depending on the required level of precision). But the map locations given in Three Kings did not follow this - or any other known - format. They were gibberish... I'm not an explosives experts but I know C4 is pretty benign until it meets with heat and/or pressure. It's unlikely that a nerf ball with C4 taped to it would explode when hitting a helicopter as it does in the movie. In any case, it would have never made contact with the helicopter in the first place because the downward wash from the blades would have knocked the ball off target...This movie would have been a lot more fun to watch (at least for this Desert Storm veteran) if it had paid a little more attention to detail and authenticity."
4,Crazy genius.,"I hesitated for quite while on this film because war films in general are not my typical genre. In fact, almost everything stacked up against it for me. I couldn't have been more completely wrong - the cast, cinematography, the dialog, the pace - stroke of pure genius on the part of Russell. Nothing was wrong with this film, it was totally amazing. Watch it!"
5,"Brilliant, funny, touching","An unconventional war movie, brilliant in execution, very funny in some parts and quite touching in some others. A cliched ending though.Dont miss it."
3,It could have been a modren kelly's heros,"This movie if you are a pvt ryan fan or platoon fan and like action you might want to skip it, but its ok. The begining is similar to Kelly's Heros, but then gets thick and they eventually don't get the gold as in Kelly's heros. Now that you look on it with the way the military is today and how the soliders need food stamps you would like them to have taken the gold. This was a missed a chance to be a great movie but it was good"
2,"By No Means The ""Best"" of '99","I bought this movie after hearing all the great things, how ""neglected"" it was, etc... And I'll agree, it was somewhat entertaining. Some of the cinematography tricks are pretty neat, but that's the only thing I found appealing about the movie. It just seemed to brush lightly on the major touch elements to the movie. It has a political agenda underneath which, while is a good message, appears heavy-handed in the end. It is OK, but by now means the best of '99. Save your money to get Fight Club. Now that is definitely the best of '99."
5,The first ever intelligent action movie,"Three kings is the first ever intelligent action movie, as well as one of the finest war films ever made. A bazooka missile is launched at a tanker truck... the heroes dive, and there is no cheesy explosion - the truck is filled with milk. Another scene involves Cube taking down a helicopter like a badass. After he takes it down and stares down at the wreckage - he does not say a stupid one-liner. The ""bad guys"", if you can call them that, are portrayed as real human beings instead of some unrealistic evil army. About the only action movie cliche in the movie is when Wahlberg takes a hit in a bulletproof vest, but it's forgiveable."
5,Three Kings is phenomenal !,"Three Kings is an action packed ride full of surprises. Another great performance from all three leading actors: George Clooney, Ice Cube, and Mark Walhberg. Its not just another Desert Storm flick, it starts out racing and doesnt stop until its over."
3,my review,"This is a behind the scenes look at the Gulf War. It is more a story of how the people of Iraq were left abandoned by the US army because they would not interfere in internal struggles. Yet, we see in this film that they were serious struggles and that the Iraqi army were killing their own people.The intervention of the US army comes about only because they find a map where the Bunkers of Saddam are said to be filled with gold. It happens to be true, but the army soldiers also live the miseries of the Iraqi people and they try to save them.This movie is also about the interference in this war from the Media. However, we see that thanks to this interference, the people of Iraqi can be ""partially"" saved.Good movie, good acting and great plot!"
4,Grate,I love this movie it took you thre the life of the war and the three/four guys that do so much good for evreyone. And they are practicily going to risk there lifes for these other slaves not to mencin there jobs. I say if you are going to see a war/fighting movie then see this one.
2,"Brother, could you spare a lime?","Three Kings is a shining example of why children shouldn't play with matches. This movie is a filmed book report. Tagline: ""A world with pedestrian themes just got windier!"" Three Kings is a movie modeled on the tradition of using a simple adventure story to guide the viewer on an odyssey of discovery and symbolism. Unfortunately, film school wasn't quite the primer needed for these fellas to make a good war picture. Bob Hope's cigarette case has seen more fire than these kids! Since when did snowboarding qualify a person as war-weary? Did the lift break? Everybody wants everything too fast--especially movie directors. Note to Hollywood: youth is NOT as good as it gets."
1,WHY? Why did I watch the whole thing?,"I have see many movies in my time and have like, loved and hated them. This one is 100% on my hate list. I just can't believe I watched the entire movie. I think that somewhere in my inner mind I thought it might get better as it went on. I was very wrong. This movie could have lasted 5 hours and that still wouldn't be enough time to recoup from it's horrible movie writing. Like so many movies people wasted their time on, this one has a popular actor in it. ""George keep your day job on ER or please be more selective with the projects you take on."" If your just in to people staring in the movies you watch and you are a die hard Clooney fan buy it! You can watch him and try and talk yourself into liking the movie. If your a serious movie watcher and don't have time to spare on bad movies, STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!"
1,"Yeah, right","Yeah, this is the best war movie ever...if you've never seen Gallipoli or Paths of Glory or Kelly's Heroes, which it was apparently stolen from along with the Kuwati gold. The fact that so many people ""looooove"" this film is sort of a sad comment on the MTV generation that doesn't know what's come before and can only sit though a film that sifts scenes as often as an eighteen wheeler heading up a hill. And for a film that is supposed to be important, it sure treats war, death and destruction frivolusly, then tacks on a studio ending so we're supposed to feel good about greedy soldiers who desert their unit to make some money. At the very least the movie should have examined why they were driven by greed. I guess the director was more interested in cool shots than a good script. Yeah, it's the best film of '99, as long as you don't count every other film that was made."
1,I've Seen Better Film On Teeth!,"This film had me in tears......from boredom! The hype that was created prior to its release made me want to see it very much, but once I rented the DVD version...I wish I'd gone for a root canal instead of wasting two hours of my life watching this drivel.Mark Wahlberg, George Clooney, and Ice Cube are all very talented actors whose films I enjoy very much. This movies was a complete waste of their talent and time. I would suggest watching something else they've starred in and save yourself the agony of sitting through Three Kings."
1,Dont watch,This movie was horrible. I really tried to like it but it was just so bad. Story and action seemed tossed together over a drinking weekend to sell before the war ended.
3,Getting nowhere slowly.,"This is an average movie. It is entertaining, but lacks any real depth. Only brief moments of interesting action. There is wierd usage of lighting and bizarre FX viewing inside the human body, wasn't convinced this really added value. I guess the female audiency might find George Clooney a redeeming feature, but he can barely act."
2,Three Kings,"I have to give all the major actors credit for acting well, except for the whine-bucket, that fortunately gets killed off. To me the Movie was a very disappointing film. If our military was as chaotic as this movie portrays it to be, we are lucky we won the war. Now to make people mad, maybe this is how reservist units behaved in the rear, but I saw no such stupidity on the real battle front, during or after the war. Had a good plot ruined by foolishness. I am trying to sell my copy, just to be rid of it..."
2,Lacking,"If you have the ability to seperate yourself from reality for over two and a half hours then this is the movie for you. The story line a good idea, but to compare it to Kelly's Heroes....c'mon. Ice Cube, Mark Whalberg and even George Cloony can not compare to Clint Eastwood and Donald Sutherland. The idea of three guys in the Gulf War walking into one of Sadam's bunkers filled with gold and waltzing out again is a bit overboard, then they feel they have to help the refugees get to the border. Only after that do the Iraqis feel they need to be stopped. It was laughable. The movie gave me a headache, the story line was jumbled and never really made any sense. If you think you are going to see a shoot'em up action movie, your wrong, if you think you are going to see a funny twist on the gulf war, wrong, the only thing here is a weak story line compounded by an even weaker cast."
2,Reviews are wrong,"Three Kings has some action, but is not like many reviewers make it sound. I rented the video because I had heard good things about it and how much other people enjoyed it. This movie was not very entertaining. The only thing it did was make me not want to go to Iraq even more. I do give it credit for showing how the life of people in Iraq is. The only thing this movie did was bore me, and make me relize I had better things to do with my time."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"When I first heard of the story-line of THREE KINGS, and then found out George Clooney was in it, the first thing that came to mind was PEACEMAKER. Fortunately for Clooney, this movie was not a bust and, to its writers credit, was very clevrly done. The way the writer was able to make a very good comedy/action film while having its main location being in a desert was pheonomenal. This film was definately a pleasant surprise."
3,WELL FILMED,"The hype for this movie ruined it. Well ruin is a strong word. It wasn't as good as they said it was but overall it was fun to watch, it had good cast ,and in the end it told a good story. When it was all over it was a sort of Kelly's Heroes for the 21st century."
5,Best film of 1999,"This has been the best year for films in perhaps a couple of decades. American Beauty, Magnolia, Fight Club, and this little masterpiece. I can't believe it did not get a nomination. If you read some of the reviews before mine, you will see that the ones that did not like the film didn't like that it changed moods throughout, from comedy to action to drama. That is the best part! You don't have any idea what will happen next, but you can't wait until it does. I did not have this on my short list to see last fall, but when I did, I was blown away by every scene and every shot. Smart, funny and eventually very moving. I guarantee every minute of this film to anyone who hasn't seen it."
4,Pretty good but not great,I liked how Kearney wove real life historical ideas into the plot of this fantasy book. Also the world is a believable one and not bogged down by too much fantasy garble. His writing is fairly entertaining and I like his style but it did not completely trap me. I don't think books have to be so very surprising and sometimes some characters would not make sense as who they are if they were too complicated. I look forward to the next book and would suggest this book to a wide range of readers. Especially if you get sick of the length of Jordan and Martin but still want a quality book.
3,The Master Of The Cinema,"For those who may not know much about Craven than you will find this an informative look into one of the best storytellers around. Craven is a master at what he does except I don't like the Scream trillogy so that was a waste of space where he could of talked more about his other wonderfully crafted films. I got a interesting look into 'A Nightmare On Elm Street', 'Shocker'and,""The Last House On The Left', but not 'The People Under The Stairs which was kind of disappointing. Other than that this is one for the fans. Worth a buy."
3,INTERESTING LOOK BACK AT WAR PROPAGANDA,"This is an uneven series of short animated propaganda and training films originally designed for military personnel during World War 2. Some of the films you will find overly long and a little dull, only of interest in a historic sense. Some are very entertaining. The best of this set are the SNAFU series using adult humor and exaggerated caricatures of the axis enemy to warn new soldiers about the dangers of spies, how to behave properly, and so on. It is worth purchasing as a curiosity, a look at one of the more creative methods the government used to present ideas and instill behavior that were considered of prime importance.- Mike S."
5,Buy more than one copy,"Asphalt is an amazing journey through an urban landscape that takes you back in time. By giving detailed descriptions of music, architect, historical reference, smells, and travels, one leaves each page experiencing the familiar and the unknown. Rux allows the reader to be captivated by the world of Couchette and Racine; and the ending will have you longing for more or rewinding as if you need to embody the words of your favorite movie on the page."
5,A happy and helpful read for Mom and her whole family.,"""When Mom's Happy, Everyone's Happy"" is a brisk and lively read, but more importantly, it is also an excellent and insightful resource for modern Moms (and their husbands and families) in a stressful world whose demands compete with the good and enjoyable family life. Written in a light and highly readable manner, the first section provides valuable, very useable tips and ideas for Mom; the second, for the whole family. I highly recommend this book for Moms and Dads and Children seeking more from their lives and relationships with each other. I have found it useful and recommend it to new mothers and learners of all ages and types. ""When Mom's Happy, Everyone's Happy"" is a happy and helpful read for Mom and her whole family.Charles RB Beckmann, MD, MHPE, FACOG, Chief, Women's Health / OBGYN, Samuel U Rodgers Community Health Center, Clinical Professor of Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Missouri at Kansas City"
4,Good collection of essays,"A good collection of essays about sexuality in the ancient world, this book should not be missed by scholars attempting to understand gender or sex. Some of the articles are better than others, some theories and methods may make the serious scholar's nose cringe, but it is an excellent way to start one's own mind turning over the questions about ancient sexuality that for too long were over looked in history and classics."
2,YAWN!!!,"AS a prospective student of cultural anthropology, this book was just boring and tedious enough to encite me to change my major. Thank God for the David Lewis-Mayberry's and Bartoleme de Las Casa's of the world or I'd be studying basketweaving 101. A good read for those who enjoy an apologetic writing style. Not!"
4,"""Ninth Street"" is a powerful film","""Ninth Street"" is the best first-time, low-budget film I have ever seen. It is even better than Spike Lee's first film--""She's Gotta Have It."" The film portrays 1960s street life in Junction City, Kansas, home to Fort Riley. Soldiers on R & R visit Ninth Street for the girls, bars and gambling. Kevin Willmott, screenwriter, actor and producer, says it is autobiographical. Two winos who sit on a couch on the sidewalk philosophize and help maintain a sense of community and order (plus give people advice). Martin Sheen plays a Catholic Worker who ministers to the downtrodden and works against the Vietnam War. This film cost only $7,000 to make but looks like a Hollywood production. It is in black 'n' white, but that doesn't detract at all from the film. It should be in everyone's collection of classics."
5,I RATE IT GREAT,"EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE A GREAT FILM IS MADE. THIS ONE TOPS THE LIST FOR INDEPENDENT FILMS. HI , I'M B.J. AND I PLAY ""WILD MARY SUE"" IN THE MOVIE. THIS WAS MY DEBUT IN A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE. THIS PRODUCTION WAS ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG FOR THIS PRODUCTION TEAM. LOOK FOR MORE CINEMATIC ACHIEVEMENT FROM ITS WRITER/DIRECTOR.ALWAYS,B.J."
5,Great history video set!,"Love this! It's fun to watch about how you used to have to disassemble your car if you scared a horse, when paved roads came into exsistance, when Ford tried to put seat belts into their cars and people complained about how it was uncomfortable for them to sit on them, the priceless story about why a California man set his dream car on fire in front of a Ford plant, when the whole American automobile industry almost died in 1979-80, and its rebirth. If you are a car buff, this is one set you do not want to miss out on."
4,need tighter control,"I bought one of these several weeks ago and ended up donating it to my daughter, who's taking a college photo class. I basically like it, but I couldn't get the camera attached tightly enough on the ball panhead to avert ""flopping."" I've been using a simple Kodak 68"" ""Go Anywhere"" Pro Monopod (about $10) for most of my non-tripod requirements, but the Kodak head doesn't tilt for angles and verticles. This was my first look at a ball panhead; I've been testing others. (See my other reviews.)Dan Harmonwww.flickr.com/photos/danharmon"
2,"Inexpensive, but poor design for the panhead.",The quality is decent except for the fact that screw does not tighten down on the panhead ball. This results in the camera just flopping around and difficulty holding the desired position.
1,Believe what you've read,"What others have said here is true: the screw that tightens the ball head to the leg is too short. As a consequence it is impossible to tighten the tilt head all the way, and so your camera will flop around atop this monopod. The heavier your apparatus, the worse the problem will be.It's hard to see how this obvious defect got past the manufacturer. I've had this monopod for several years and made several unsuccessful attempts to fix the problem. Ultimately I simply super-glued the ball to the tilt head, which defeated the tilt feature (that never worked anyway), but at least it allowed for some functionality.I came here to see if Vanguard was still selling this piece of junk when I went back online to buy an add-on tilt head. Think I'll go with the Manfrotto 234. I could just get a whole new monopod, but I really want a good tilt head, and this appears to be the only way to be sure I'll get what I want--as long as the superglue holds (it will)."
3,"Nice, but overly beaded!","The bag is a nice size and shape, but I find it's a bit overkill with all the beads! It would snag my clothes if I wear it on my shoulder since the handles are beaded all over, and on both sides of the bag, too. Perhaps it would be more functional as a real bag if it was only lightly beaded on one side and not at all on the handles, and use more embroidery instead of beads to decorate. Less is best!"
4,Very pretty and a beader's dream,"I like this purse so much, that I have saved it for an evening bag, or maybe even a date bag! The only drawback was that it arrived with a petroleum smell, which aired-out in a few days outside. The black is very shiny, like satin, and the embroidery in red and green makes it look very ""christmas time"". All the beading is nicely done. I know it is a hit, because my good friend, who is picky, loves it. If you buy it for a gift, open it and air it out first. Maybe put a dryer sheet, or a sachet in, and when it is ready, wrap it up. That is my experience with this purse. Happy shopping!"
1,Tips are jagged and appear broken off,"The tips of the hex keys are not machined flat. They look like they are just broken off, with a jagged surface. I am returning it."
2,I'm too old for this,"This is a book you should read in your teens or even before. As an adult, I found it tedious, obvious and even boring. This is fodder for long conversations between earnest youths, not anything most adults need to waste any time on.Anyone over the age of twenty should have already had every thought Singer expresses here and have come to their own peace with the difficulties of ethics. At the end of the day, most of us realize that we can't ever know enough to judge what is ""right"" or ""wrong""; we can only bumble along doing our best and live with the guilt that our lack of certainty brings.I think Singer just never grew up. If I were ten or eleven, I'd probably treasure this. At sixty-one, it's a complete bore.So: five stars if you are an adolescent exploring your ethical self. Two stars or less for anyone else."
1,Is Singer sacred?,"The man touted as the greatest thinker of the age and most highly paid philosopher believes the retarded, the infirm and his aged mother should die for the convenience of the finances of the Government, more money to pay for his academic grants, and the preservation of cockroaches. If one advocated this as self-interest philosophers such as Parfit would call this monstrous, but since it is done in the name of self-sacrifice, it is all quite all right.This social darwinism with a collectivist or socialist face is quite interesting as a roman a clef philosophy of psychological confession--if one substitutes ""I"" in his prescriptions (or should one say proscriptions?). ""Human Life is not sacred"" or ""Those society views as misfits should die"" and so on become more interesting when we realize Singer is saying ""My life isn't sacred "" and ""Those I view as misfits should die.""Socrates would disagree with Singer, Hitler would not. This book will be a sure hit at the Universities."
2,Not what I was expecting,"For some reason I thought this would be a spiritual look at philosophy, life, etc. ... a more ""light"", eastern-style book. After reading just a few pages, it seemed to me to be more a way of showcasing Singer's own intellect. I can't stomach books full of pseudo-intellectual double-speak. Just say what you gotta say, without trying to come off so damned intellectual!"
3,Not so hot soup,"I am a soup person. Enjoy making different kinds of soup and sharing my creations with fellow co-workers.I have a thermos that keeps coffee HOT all day, Just to small of an opening for cream rock cod soup.This Food jar has just the righ size opening to carry soups, stews or anything else that you may want to enjoy for lunch.The 16 oz is good size, easy to carry, large enough opening, BUT it just does not keep foods hot enough buy the time lunch rolls around. This food jar doe's not retain the heat as I expected."
3,"Powerful, Strong Beaters, Great Whisk, but TOO NOISY!","I bought this for my wife after her Kitchenaide's beaters bent out of shape from normal use. It didn't seem to make sense to buy more beaters... I always thought they were flimsy. SO... this model caught my eye. The beaters are stiffer and have stronger welds than the Kitchenaide. It's great to have the whisk attachment. BUT, the unit is VERY noisy and the plastic bin that is supposed to clip under the unit for storage warps and falls off. Not a bad unit... just not perfect."
2,Easy to use mixer,This mixer has a problem. It is easy to use and lightweight but the attachments don't snap in securely. The beaters fall out when in use. The storage box that the mixer sits on makes it convenient to find everything in one place. It has plenty power and speed so mixing and blending time is quick - if the beaters would stay in place. Would not recommend it to any baker looking for a lightweight mixer.
5,Replacement Flag,"The Annin Nyl-Glo U.S. replacement flag, 4x6"" was the exactly what I wanted and ordered. It would have cost me almost twice as much at other vendors. I am very pleased!"
5,The Power of Having Desire,"This book is as entertaining and enjoyable as it is enlightening. The opportunity to 'peek' into the lives of so many individuals, famous and not-so-famous, who share the common thread of desire, perseverance and success is a truly unique yet contagious way to discover your own desire."
5,Best Parenting book,"Dinkmeyer's parenting books for children and for teens are the best I've used as a parenting expert. The books are easy to understand and put into practice. The parenting principle is based on the ""Father of Parenting"" - Rudolph Dreikurs. Any book on the use of natural and logical consequences is a spin off of Dreikurs' work. Dr. Don Dinkmeyer was a student of Dreikurs. His books have had great popularity by those who know about parenting counseling."
3,A Bit Dated,"It's time for the authors to update this valuable resource. I took a STEP for Children study 8 years ago, and was excited to follow up with the Teen version. However, there are many references to things like limiting the use of the dial up computer time so as not to tie up the house phone. With a few careful updates to make it more 2011+, this could once again be useful to parents. As it is, it feels dated & therefore, not a good choice for my small group."
1,BOB SAGET MAKES ME SICK,BOB SAGET IS LIKE A DISEASE - HE IS INFESTING THE PEOPLE OF EARTH WITH HIS FILTH AND HIS NEO-NAZI TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATIONS.DO NOT WATCH HIS SHOWS OR MOVIES OR YOU WILL BE DAMAGED FOREVER.MIND MY WORDS - BEWARE OF BOB SAGET!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,horrible scent,I bought cotton candy and a cuba - while I LOVE Cuba for me - the cotton candy was a BAD purchase. It smells TOO TOO fruity and very obnoxious.. Can not return it due to hazardous package requirements so I am stuck with it. Looks like we will throw this away... If I could I would give a -5 review on this one...
3,Cotton Candy Body Spray,I wanted something that wasn't super sweet smelling i smelled the one in a Japanese store and the smell wasn't as strong as the one I got here. But it came pretty fast so thats one good thing.
3,Leaves a little to be desired.,"I bought this a month ago. I've used other cotton candy fragrances and decided to try this one. Its not the best I've used, but definitely not the worst. It has a sort of chemical odor to me that is a huge turn-off. If it weren't for that I would have given this 4 stars. The thing is, it does smell like cotton candy, but its a so-so resemblance. I wouldn't buy it again."
3,Yumm,"This body spray smells delicous, but after a while I cant smell it anymore and I wonder if its that my nose got used to the smell and doesnt notice it anymore or if it wore off.. But anyway I think it was worth it for how cheap it was :)"
4,Hmm...,"When you first smell it, it's like grape medicine, which is kind of gross. After a little bit, it smells more like cotton candy. I don't hate it, I don't love it, but it's pretty good after a little bit"
4,Truth in advertising,"You really need to be dedicated to smelling like cotton candy if you wear this. I know a lot of people say it's sexy or whatever, but I found it kind of overwhelmingly powerful, like I had been involved in some kind of industrial accident involving a cotton candy booth at a state fair. Four stars though because it definitely does what it says on the tin!"
3,havent received it yet.,i found this same product at Walmart for $6.00. i wish i had looked there first and i would have saved some money but i am looking foward to this smell. several you tubers says its smells like candy and thats what i am looking for!
3,Esperaba algo mas dulce!,"Realmente esperaba mas de este producto por los buenos comentarios que lei! Este lo usare porque ya lo compre y no huele mal, solo pense que seria mas dulce y el olor duraria mas tiempo. Definitivamente el Cotton candy no lo compraria otra vez. Intentare con el Sugar Vanilla a ver si me gusta mas."
5,"Yummy, attention getting","Originally I bought this for a friends daughter, but ended up being my favorite scent to wear for several years. The guys at work love it, and I always get compliments from strangers."
2,may be watered down,I buy this fragrance all the time at Walgreens but they are often out of it so I was excited to find the product here. HOWEVER...I think that it is either old or has been diluted with alcohol. It's definitely the same fragrance but the alcohol smell is very overpowering compared to what I buy at the store. It may just be old because the bottle style is definitely not being used anymore by Body Fantasies and hasn't been used for at least two years. I thought maybe it was a fluke on the first bottle but I ordered a second one and it was the same way. The alcohol smell evaporates but it doesn't smell as strong as the ones I buy at the store....so buyer beware.
4,my crush calls me cotton candy now!,I keep this in my locker at school and I always put it on because my crush calls me cotton candy now!!!
5,My daughters favorite,They have changed the packaging on this product but the original is the best one it has a strong cotton candy smell
2,STRONG COTTON CANDY SMELLL!!!!,hate it!!! i worn this and when i spray it my friends cringe...itt smells terrible and it doesn't last!! I didnt want to waste my money by throwing it away so i mix it with perfume or body spray!!!
3,It'ts a book!,"It was required book for college class. Lots of good illustrations, there is a section of 32 color pages, the rest are grayscale! If you need it for school, buy it."
3,oily mess twice,"I was let down. First order I open the box and found the plastic gas tank broken, no packing at all! oil was everywhere even though units are to be shipped with out oil. amazon was good, they had ups pick it up and send me another(no returns/ fine print). second unit had no packing at all and oil was everywhere but nothing broken. assembly was easy but could not get it started till i removed the air filter that was soaked in oil. i have to buy a new one. unit worked ok without it dont think i will buy expensive items through amazon any longer"
4,Beware: Packaging was awful for a $400 investment,"We have only had our Karcher pressure washer for a few days so I will update on the machines performance after a longer period of time. However, buyers should be aware that the machine comes in a cardboard box - that's it.... no packaging materials, no bubble wrap - no protection whatsoever. The box was very beat up when it arrived. It's a heavy machine to be shipped in a simple box. We were lucky that nothing was broken.So far we are impressed with it's cleaning ability. We are using it on a concrete pool deck and patio furniture. More comments on durability and performance to follow after a longer ownership timeframe."
1,Crappy Pressure Washer,"I bought the G2600PH 2 years ago - used it 4 or 5 times (total of 3 hours). I was using the washer when it just stopped working. Brought it to an authorized service center and was told that the pump SEIZED. The total for repairs would be $375.00 (more than I paid for the washer new). Karcher customer service SUCKS! I put in 7 phone calls and 3 emails - NADA, not even a response. They didn't even contact the service center. I have read other reviews that appear to state the same issues. Don't buy a Karcher - their product sucks and is only matched by their crappy customer service/support."
1,Don't buy!,"I bought my pressure washer from Sam's, it's the same model as is shown here. The first one I took home and hooked up the garden hose and the connector came off in my hand. I took it back to Sam's and they made it good and gave me another. I have used the washer less than 10 times in a little over 2 years. The wand broke in the middle where the trigger assembly and the lance portion connect. I contacted Karcher and never did get to speak to a human. I finally got the parts from an aftermarket seller of Karcher parts. I received the new wand assembly and installed it. I used the washer for approx. 20 minutes and the engine seized. I figure it cost me a little more than $30.00 per use. If you can afford to pay those rates go ahead and get one, I found that I couldn't afford it."
2,"So far, not great quality","These looked like the same bags I had been using from Pet Smart. However, I'm about a week or so in and the bottom dropped out of 1 bag. Ew. The bag I tried to use yesterday was sealed on both ends & I couldn't use it. Had to go back with a new bag and pick ""it"" up. I'm hoping it's a fluke roll, but I don't know."
4,Nice and handy-but a little pricey.,Nice and handy-but a little pricey. First got them in a Petco where they're also expensive. Was able to get them here on a 4 for 3 deal that gave them to me half price. Quality bags plus convenience.
5,Perfect for our Walks,These bags are so handy and perfect for our walks. We even keep them in the yard to use for poop pick up.
5,Cheapest on Amazon,"This product is obviously very popular, and I find them in every retail shops for pet products. But in my area, the Amazon price is the most competitive, and with Free Shipping, no other retail stores can beat it. Thanks, Amazon.com!"
1,Bags are NOT 100% biodegradable as advertised,"I bought them under the impression the bags were biodegradable as stated on the listing but when i received the package, the fine print says *except as defined in California*. California defines biodegradable to mean ""a material which generally will decompose when it is disposed within one year through natural processes into a nontoxic condition, as defined"". So basically for this company to claim it's biodegradable even if it takes 5-10 years to decompose is very misleading. If you're concerned about the environment, as we all should, then this isn't the right product for you."
3,Not biodegradable but.....,Unless you want to pay 4 times as much for biodegradable bags these are the next best thing(sorry Earth). I took 2 stars off for the shady advertising and probably should take off more for a company that is deliberately trying to trick consumers. It is good quality at a good price though so I have to go with a 3 star with a bad taste in my mouth rating.
1,"Too Small, Too Hard to Tear","I primarily got these bags due to price.I have two problems with these bags;I train and work with German Shepherds who can leave some larger waist. I find I sometimes have to use two for one disposal, particularly if I want to tie a knot in the top. I find myself having to pack twice as many on trips.The second problem is I find I have to be very careful when tearing off a bag. They do not tear strait across. The way they are perforated, they tend to tear along one side, and will take the side of the next bag with it. This makes the next bag a two sided piece of plastic.May be OK for small dogs, but I still have a problem with how they tear off the roll."
1,Don't like new design.,"I loved these bags before they redesigned them. (I would have rated them 5 stars previously.) The new shape makes it difficult to figure out where to tear them and it also causes them to protrude from the holder by about 5 or 6 inches. I have also found that when tearing off a new bag, it sometimes tears away from the perforation. This leaves a hole in the bag so it is unusable. I'm very disappointed."
1,Very poor quality,"These bags are very poorly constructed. They are so flimsy that when you try to separate the bags (as gently as you do it), you will end up tearing the bag. Aboout every 4 out of 10 bags have fallen apart on me."
2,Bags with Tears in Them? Yuck!,"I don't think these bags are of very high quality. In the roll I'm using now, about 1/4 of them come out slit up the side, making them useless. This has happened on previous rolls, just not to this extent. There is either poor quality control or the bags are just poorly made, period."
1,Don't buy,"They said they reduced 20% of material but as many said, it tears so easy and you will probably waste more than 20%. So it is not eco friendly at all and for us, it is much more expensive deal. Just cannot believe they actually approved and released as product. What shame."
4,If only they were biodegradable,". . . then they would be nearly perfect. I am halfway through my second 120 pack and I haven't had a single bag fail as in tearing, failing to break cleanly from the roll, or having holes or any breaches. The value is reasonable, the dispenser is easy to load and use. One small gripe is that the bags are a bit more difficult to pull from the roll than other brands I've used. My kids have an especially difficult time tearing them away, and often when they return from walking the dog, there is a 2 foot length of bags hanging from the dispenser, evidence of the struggle they had trying to tear one away. Aside from that, it is a great product and unless someone makes an identical product with respect to price and quality, and includes biodegradability, (and is available with Super Saver Shipping), I will continue to buy these."
5,handy,This large size package is pretty nice with a tip out dispenser on the side of the box. The price is so much less than buying bag rolls at the pet supply stores.
2,Not so Great product,I have used the bags on board brand dog bags before and have been very satified. However the last time i purchased them the quality was much reduced. The bags are now very thin and rip. As anyone can imagine having a dog bag tear is not an experience you want. For the price of these dog bags it is hard to beleive that the slight reduction in plastic makes a significant difference in profit to the company owners.
1,False advertising,Every time I use it in pack n bag it tears the bag open! {t says fits all but is not for all.
1,"These are not degrable, do not be fooled.",These are PLASTIC bags. NOT BIO FRIENDLY! These can not be composted. The are NOT environmentally friendly. They are just like plastic grocery bags. I am returning these and going to[...] I only clicked on a one star rating because I can't post without doing some sort of rating. I rate these as ZERO.
4,I like these bags. I use them every day.,It is the same as the one I buy in the store/They are very convenient to use every day.
2,inferior quality control,"Great idea; poor quality control/production... perforation/separation area between bags is terrible. If you're lucky enough to get a bag off the roll without it shredding, splitting, or tearing where the perforations are... great. I get ""a good one"" after maybe discarding a half dozen or so. Of course I then looked at the product origin (China) and it now makes sense..."
2,Does what its supposed to do...,These bags are very hard to use separating the folds of the top and opening them to do their job is difficult. I have to wrestle with them every time.My big complaint is that they do not keep in the smell like other bags do. If you throw a loaded one into the kitchen trasheveryone will know its there. Cheap but not for me...
5,Bags on Board? I'm on board!,"I love these bags. They're so handy! Of course, I made the mistake of buying the wrong brand. I meant to buy the ones that pull out from the center. But, after using these, I find that these are actually easier to use and are more easily found on Amazon. Yay!"
1,These bags are NOT BIODEGRADABLE,"The photo in the description (at time of review) shows a little logo that says the bags are biodegradable. But when the bags arrived, the little logo says, ""Stop over-poop-ulation"" and shows no mention of being bidegradable. I tried to contact the company for clarification, but received no response. I'm returning the product and will not be buying anything from the Bags on Board brand."
3,A Little Small for Cats,"I often use two to clean the box. My cat is around 14 pounds, and emits 2 #1 and 1 #2 and these bags are just a skoch on the small side.The bags in the 315-count size measure 3.6x2.6x9.5 which is about 20% larger, I'll go with these the next time."
1,Why did they change the bags??? Will not buy again!,"Upon receiving these bags, I noticed that the design and quality of Bags on Board bags have completely changed since the last time I bought them. The new bags I received now rip apart at the seams when you try to open them and the actual bag is of much lower quality than before. They also added a handle which also complicates using the bags. I'm not sure why the company has made this change, but I will not be buying them again."
4,Gets the job done.,If you HAVE to pick up your dog poop - these sure do get the job done. Plus their blue. S*** always looks better in blue.
5,Great product!,"We have a 90-lb black lab who gets walked through our neighborhood at least twice a day and we have used these bags for quite awhile to clean up after him. They work great. We had previously been purchasing them from a pet store, but Amazon has the best price, and the 120 bag price was a great deal. I got them within one week of my order with no problems whatsoever. If you have a pet, please be courteous and clean up after them. With these bags, it is really very easy."
3,doggie pooh bag review,"Bags seem good,but a little too thin. I prefer something with more body and I don't feelthe pooh so much when I pick it up."
2,"Handles, please","Overall, hard to deal with while walking a dog, trying to tie off. Needs handles, or maybe a just made little longer to be able to tie off. Some were hard to open, also."
1,not enviromentally friendly,"I bought these because they claim they are biodegradable. I don't know about the bag itself, but once you get down to the last bag, the little roll in the middle (the thing the bags wrap around) is a considerable chunk of plastic which is obvioulsy not biodegradable or recycleable. Whatever!"
1,Worst Poop Bag Ever!!!,"Poop bags are too short. They do not open easy. Too many times I am standing in the freezing rain trying to open a poop bag. Today, after five minutes, I said to hell with it and left the poop. DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP. They are so bad they should pay you to use them. Generic bags are better."
2,No handles,"I bought these as a cheaper alternative to Doggie Walk Bags, which I had been using for many years. When I received them, I discovered a significant shortcoming - the bags have no handles. You need handles to be able to tie up the bags, and to carry them with. The old adage ""You get what you pay for"" is true in this instance, I guess."
3,Smaller bags then expected,"These are slightly smaller (9x12?, didn't measure) then the other bags on board products we get in the store (9x14). Ok for smaller dogs. But we wanted the slightly bigger bags, so were disappointed."
2,New Design is Awful,"This product has been updated with a ""new"" design which is supposed to be more eco friendly with 20% less plastic. The problem is that the new design causes me to rip wholes in the bag with trying to separate the bag from the roll. The old design was much better."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this new design. I have used these bags for years and was happy to purchase in a large quantity.The design concept is a great idea as it cuts down on the size of the bag. However trying to tear the bag from the roll in itholder is very difficult and sometimes tears the side of the bag which makes it unusable. I am a senior citizen and find it easierto use the bags out of the container. Maybe a new container design would be the answer.I don't think I will order again which will be a while anyway, because I was sent two orders."
1,Bags on Board quality change,"I have used Bags on Board for many years, through the lives of four dogs. Now, all of a sudden, the manufacturer decides to cut corners and produce an inferior product. The bags are thinner, tear easily, and very difficult to pull apart. In fact, I wound up with holes in several bags just trying to get them apart. I'm about to throw the order out, and want to advise Amazon not to carry this brand any longer."
2,Please go back to the original style!,"Please go back to the original style. This new style was a good thought with the handles, but tearing a bag off is such a pain!! I rip/waste so many!"
1,HORRIBLE! They Rip so easily!,"Every time I take my dog out, I curse these bags (an unfortunately, I purchased a ton of them before I realized how bad they are). Terrible curved design which makes it impossible to rip one bag off without ripping the bag in two. I have to really concentrate to rip the bag without breaking it and that is not what I want to do on a cold early morning walk! Stick to the straight rip design. Can't wait til I am done with these things."
1,The new bag shapes are horrible!,"The new bags have a fancy ""easy-tie"" shape with curved handles and are significantly shorter than the previous rectangular bags (which had shrunk once before in recent years from the original bags)... The worst part is you invariably rip the corner of one or the other of the bags when you try to separate them along the fancy shape, and then you have a nice poop hole in the corner just large enough for your finger to get thru... I've been using these bags for years, but never again!!! If I could give 0 stars and a poopy smell, I would. I'll have to find another kind of bag -- unfortunately I just bought three huge boxes. :-(PS Good news -- I learned from Bramton that ""We have listened to our consumers and are switching back to our original style."""
1,Beware the bags with the tie handles,"Instead of getting the rectangular bags I thought I was ordering, I got another type, NOT PICTURED, that were shaped like little purses with handles to tie to top. It was impossible to separate bags on the perforated line without tearing the bag rendering it useless. Complained to the seller by phone and got nothing...they said I could return the bags which would have cost as much as I paid for them.So, I called Bags on Board who apologized profusely, said they have discontinued these bags due to complaints like mine, and agreed to send me several rolls of rectangular bags for free. They did, indeed, send me 12 rolls and 5 coupons worth one dollar each towards the purchase of more bags. I really appreciated the way they stepped up, unlike this seller. I will never buy from this source again."
1,The old bags are better & I didn't know I was getting the new kind.,"I've used bags on board for a couple years and have always loved them. With this order, the bags were different. Shaped in a U-shape instead or a rectangle. They split apart when you try and remove them from the roll. They are also smaller. Bad all around. I sure hope this hasn't replaced the old bags."
1,This Used to be a Great Product Now it's Junk,"These bags were recently redesigned and two changes make them close to useless. First, the bags are much flimsier and prone to ripping. Second, by adding what I'm sure the designers thought would be convenient tie flaps, the bags are very difficult to pull off the roll.Not worth buying again!"
1,Poor bags on board refills,"Did not know that this product had been changed so much. It is thinner, light weight and designed to tear apart when using it. Many of the bags as we started using them came apart as we were in the process of cleaning up after the dog. Some half-wit apparently decided we needed to have a way of tying the bag after filling it. We could tie it closed very nicely with the old style bags which are heavier and hold together very well. I am currently searching for a replacement bag and will likely dispose of these that I bought unused. Very poor quality and a stupid design."
4,A little thin... Otherwise fine,"When starting this review I was thinking... they are Dog Pick-Up Bags, how could I not give them a 5-star rating?!Still, I thought about any possible negatives and decided that the bags feel a little thinner than others I have purchased from other local stores. I do not consider this a serious problem, and will consider purchasing more in the future, but the characteristic was enough for me to choose ""I like it"" (description for 4 stars)."
1,Too short,"We have gotten bags on board Dog waste bags before but these seem to be much shorter, and unfortunately when we pick up dog poop it gets on our hands.!"
5,Handy,They take up little space and it's nice having them available. Would like a better holder for them (see my rating on the holder).
2,"I like this, but hope it can be less expensive","One thing I do not quite understand. The 120 bags package only cost $7, but why 60 bags package cost just a little lower at $5, hope the price can go down more. Otherwise, I like this package, because I can easily squeeze it into the my table drawer."
4,Biodegradeable doggie bags,"These bags pick up poop real good. Plus they are good for the enviroment, being biodegradeable and all. The only problem with them is that they are huge, so it looks like your getting alot but your not."
4,A little expensive but very handy,"I've tried using things like grocery bags, bags from newpapers, etc. Grocery bags work pretty well but you have to preinspect them for holes first, and throw out the bad ones before you save them. Bags on Board is the ""real thing"" and substitutes just don't cut it. The package says they are biodegradeable ""except in California"" which I suspect is the only state in which there are actual standards on making this claim. I suppose the reality is that my pet's waste will sit in a landfill for a very long time before breaking down. I'm not proud of this, but as with disposable diapers, the convenience of easy local hygiene wins out. I've been using these for years now, and it's great that Amazon has them for less than the local pet store. They're a little expensive, but considering that it is pretty unneighborly to leave poo around, I think they've paid for themselves."
3,"Good quality in general, with few defects","These bags are pretty well made, however, I've encountered 3 bags that were sealed on both ends so I couldn't open them, and 2 that were not sealed at all on either side.Given that they're about 6 cents per bag when you purchase 315 bags (compared to other bags that are half the price), I think they should have a better quality control."
2,Just one flow,Opening the bags is just a little easier then opening a safe without the combination. Size is good as is the abilty to tie it closed
1,Bag tear easily and leaked a few times.,"I don't understand how it's hard to make a bag that's1) Easy to tear from each other2) Doesn't leak3) Thick enough to not have to feel the poop.This bag doesn't do any of these, would not recommend them."
4,These are one of the best brands of bags,I have found Bags on Board to be a better brand than some of the others which are thinner or smaller. Buying on Amazon is cheaper than Petsmart as well.
5,Good For Pups On the Move,"Good Sturdy bags, do the job. A tad on the expensive side, but the best i've had in this type of product."
3,Upgraded review to a 3,"Unlike the scented bags or the bright-colored bags, these bags are extremely thin and contain many flaws. I have used these bags before without problems, but this order is different. I am unable to use 1 out of every 5 bags (seems like 1 out of every 2). The bags split, have a whole, bottom not sealed. These are not problems you can overcome when dealing with dog doo. The whole reason we use the bag is to pick up and protect hand.ADDENDUM (15 OCT 12): I must have hit 2 bad rolls because further down into the bag (remaining 6 rolls) I had no issues whatsoever. Overall these brand has performed very well."
5,Just what I ordered!,"These bags are great, I've used them for about 2 years now! I like that they are good for the environment too."
4,Good Sturdy Bag,"I have a dog who eats poop. He eats his sometimes but he most definitely eats the other dog's poop, as soon as she goes!So I have to pick up poop every time 2 medium sized dogs go out in our backyard. And I don't do poop-scooping well (hand problems). I've used these for years when I cycled with my dogs. They are sturdy. You hands don't get gross even if you're picking up loose stool, which I have been recently as one of my dog's is sick. I think they are a good bargain if you buy them in a packages of eight.I don't know how well they'd work if you had, say, a Great Dane, but they seem to have a good capacity.Biggest downside is they are hard to open, like a sticky plastic bag would be....you have to struggle a bit but it's understandable because they are on a roll! I try to get the bag going before I really need it! Plus they're not biodegradable but I've also heard you shouldn't use dog stool as fertilizer anyway."
3,Damnit! 315 count bags are SMALLER!,"I read a review on here that stated that the 315 count Bags On Board are an inch or so smaller. I had forgotten about this and ordered them anyway the second time around. The reviewer had stated something like, it's nice to have the extra length when tying up and keeping your hands away from the dog waste. The reason I want to repeat this review is as a warning. I have three small dogs and the regular size bags can handle all of the 'stuff' so I don't need to replace the bag at each 'event'. With these shorter bags, this is not possible. Who would have though that less than a two inch difference would have such a big impact but it does. The bags are fine and of fine quality like the regular ones in the 120 count. They're just shorter in length. This length, however, is significant."
1,Stupid Redesign!,Why did this company try to fix what wasn't broken?? This was a good product before they decided to redesign it. Now there's more 'handle' to the bag than there is area to hold the poop. And the plastic is thinner and very flimsy. The seams don't hold up either. I will not buy these bags again and I've been using them for years. Thankfully there are alternatives that are biodegradable.
1,"Bad, bad re-design of a once fantastic product","These bags used to be great! The perforation between each bag used to be well-defined, so it was easy to tear off a bag, and you'd never have problems tearing the bag itself.Not anymore - the bags have been redesigned for the worse - the perforation is very shoddy now, which makes it very easy to tear the bag itself apart.This product WAS easy and convenient to use. This is no longer the case."
1,Do NOT ORDER,"The bags have changed. They are no longer rectangular but now oddly shapen and pretty much useless with a curved edge that makes them hard to tear apart and hard to use and leaves straggling ""handles"" sticking out the dispenser. I am returning my latest order. An order a month ago had the old product which was great. There's no indication on Amazon that it's different now BUT IT IS. Avoid. They really need to give this a separate product code because it is pretty much a different bag."
1,bags are now smaller than they used to be!,"read the other reviews. these bags used to work great, but in mid to late 2011 the manufacturer changed the size of the bags. they're now 2"" shorter and are not large enough for large deposits."
2,Do not fix something that was not broken,"This redesign is one of the worst redesigns accorded to a product. You have a product that used to work beautifully, and you decided to go ahead and change it into a design that just is so far away from what it used to be, it is hard to get used to separating them or using them.For the first time in close to 6 years, I have had poop touch my hands, and at one point, in the dark, I didn't realize the flimsy 'tie-ends' touched the poop, and I carried it to the front of my jeans.I would be switching to another product right away unless you go back to the old design, and make a note on the description indicating you have done so."
2,flawed bag design,"I am a long time user of Bags on Board refills. This time, the bag seems to have been redesigned to include some sort of ties. Tearing the bag is problematic, and two bags of my first roll tore off with the bag's seams completely torn. So, I could not use two bags in first batch. Sticking with the old design, a plain rectangle bag works best. I wish I knew of this new design before purchasing this product."
1,TERRIBLE Redesign,"The new design of these bags is terrible. I lose two bags by ripping them trying to get them off the roll for every one that I successfully rip off. It is so irritating, especially at night in the dark with two dogs who like to do their own thing. I absolutely HATE these new bags, I actually thought about sending them back. I really hope this isn't a permanent thing, and I hope they aren't doing this to all the bags in this line."
2,Too thin,"These bags are too thin. I will never buy this brand again. It takes me well over a minute each time just to get them open. They are so thin it is hard to get any grip when you rub them between your fingers. There have got to be better dog waste bags out there. The bags I got with my bag holder were much better. Just wish I could find more of those without having to buy another holder each time. The refills of that maker are a little better than these, but still not as good as the single roll that comes with the carrier. What a gyp."
2,Not biodegradable,I would not have purchased them if I knew they were not biodegradable. Other than that they are fine.
2,expensive for shipping,Good item but the shipping cost was just as much as the item if i had time to go to the store and buy it myself i would have rather than paying the outrageous shipping cost.
2,Work but Not Biodegradable,"These bags are a great concept if you take your dogs in public. However, they are not biodegradable. Such a waste...pun intended."
2,they smell bad,The bags are thick and the right length but they strongly smell like poop even before you touch anything with them. They will leave your hand smelling like poop after you use them too. It's a shame since it was very convenient to get them in bulk but now I can't wait for the pack to be empty.
2,"Bags on Board ""biodegradable?"" No!","These bags are *not* biodegradable as advertised!!!If you are environmentally aware and want a doggy disposable/biodegradable poop bag, try Bio Bags Dog Waste Poop Bags instead.The ONLY reason I gave these bags 2 stars is because they're sturdy."
5,"Bulk pricing, YAY!","I searched all over and couldn't find them much cheaper than amazon, even ordering in bulk.These fit my dog's leash and hold the smell of his poo in better than the grey bags I have bought before."
5,"I have a small 10lb dog, this is very convenient",I find that these bags ultra convenient. They are pretty sturdy and pick up most of his messes. I think it beats carrying around ill-suited produce bags or shopping bags.
5,Bag's,They are as good as the one's you buy in the store. Have bought a c few times very happy with them.
4,This is the Best buy on poo bags,"Best bags and great prices, go ahead and stop shopping, this is what you want. Better order two boxes, cause when you run out you'll wish you had more on hand."
2,Too Small,These bags cannot be used with a pooper scooper because you will not be able to open the device. Might work for toy breeds but definitely not for my golden retriever!!!
1,Do Not Buy!,"I have been buying these bags for over 5 years. They used to be good. Then the company decided to start ripping off buyers. The bags have gotten thinner and much smaller. They split. If you have a normal sized hand and you are picking up a big mess, good luck. They are too short to tie off. My guess is that they now make two bags with the amount of plastic that used to be used for one bag. Double the profits. Using these bags is like trying to pick up dog poop with a condom!"
1,cheaper version of the original,"I've been buying this product since my dog was a pup and these bags are both thinner and shorter than they have always been, for no less money. You can't cheap out on a product and expect people will just continue to purchase it. I will be taking my business to another brand, as I expect many other loyal customers will."
1,Don't buy this product!,"These are misrepresented as a refill pack. It is a lie. They are shorter bags by 2"". They do not work for me, I have large dogs.I will never buy Bags on Board again. I've written the company and they have ignored me."
1,New Shape Bags are flawed,"These new 'New Shape' bags are seriously flawed. The first bag off the roll split down the side. The second had a slice half way down making a big hole in the side. the cutting machine does a poor job at the handle ends resulting in torn bags This was a 315 pantry pack and as soon as we buy some new bags at a local store, these are going back to Amazon. We will have to seriously debate on whether or not to continue to buy the bags from Amazon or pay a bit more for the brand available from the local pet store."
2,Bags 120ct shorter,I bought these thinking they were the same size but these are a lot shorter. Buy if you have a small dog.
1,"Quality diminished, bags got smaller","(Revised 2012-03-05) The bags got smaller and less durable. They tear when rolling up over my hands. This wasn't a problem with the old style. Not sure why they changed them, but we are severely disappointed. This used to only be a problem with the 315-pack, but now it applies to the 120-pack as well."
3,"Great product, but bags are clear","I purchased these bags to use with the bone dispenser and they work great. They are the perfect size and I've never had one tear or rip. I love that they are smaller so it isn't a waste of material, yet big enough to use with any sized dog. The only drawback is that individually they are clear and not bright blue. After you clean up your dog's mess it is a bit disgusting to see the dog poo through the clear bag for the rest of the walk. If they weren't clear, I would give it 5 stars."
4,Good bag.,I use these in my bone dispenser and they come out very easy and rip well. Nice bag density.
5,Great dependable bags!,"And isn't that what's important? No unexpected holes or tears? I'm an engineer and can tell you that it takes money/time to have this kind of reliability. I've used this brand so many times now, never disappointed by it."
5,my favorite dog walking purchase ever!,"We always remove doggy doo from our lawn before mowing. It's very frustrating when it's not our doggie's doo! I never leave mine in another's yard & expect the same. Here it's the law to clean up after your pup, but some don't.If I see somebody's dog poo on my lawn & start to walk away, I come out with my leash that has the handy bag holder & offer them a bag (pretending that they forgot theirs & didn't intentionally plan to leave it.) I then tell them that they can feel free to put used pet bags in my bin so they don't have to walk around with them. My clean up of ""NMD"" (not my dog) waste has decreased immensely!!!Bags on Board Bone Dispenser, 30 Bags"
4,Don't use the dispenser,"Just buy the bags and forget the dispenser and you won't have any problems tearing the bagsoff the roll. Have had no problems with bags tearing or breaking, but my dogs are small. Myonly complaint is that I wish these bags were longer to make it easier to tie. Handling two dogspulling on their leashes while trying to tie the bag can be a pain and another couple of inchesin length would make it a lot easier."
1,Waaaay too short in length for any dog larger than chihuahua size,"Bags are ridiculous - will never order any waste bags again until I absolutely know their length. If your dog is larger than a miniature anything, you'd do well to stay away."
1,Not Sturdy,"Let's face it, you don't want your poop bag tearing at the critical moment! That's what happened with the very first bag I used - yuk. After that, I checked them out before using them. There were at least 2 bags per roll that would tear down the side before I'd even use them. I couldn't wait to get through them (which happened more quickly since I frequently needed a second one after the first one ripped) so I could order something new. Beware!"
2,"New design makes bag smaller, if you have a big dog, these do NOT work very well!","I purchase items off of Amazon all the time, and I am finally leaving a review because I was upset with these! Bags on Board must want to save some money, because the new design of these bags make them WAY smaller than the normal size, making it very difficult to pick up poop if you have a bigger dog. It's hard to explain, but basically the top side and bottom side curve in, so the plastic part is about half the size than the middle, so it takes some work to pick up the poop without it getting on your hands. I gave these to my boyfriend who has a smaller dog, and re-ordered different bags. The pictures on the left are NOT how the bags look now!"
2,"Hate the new shape, they save money, you get poop pn your hands","I use bags on board all the time, i really like them but the last package i recieved wete cut differentshorter bags with tie handles. Less room for the poop and much harder to keepthe the the poopoff of your hands."
1,New bag designs are terrible!!!!,"I have been a faithful customer of bags on board, TILL my last order. They have changed the design and it sucks.The tear-off is now curved, and takes FOREVER to separate one bag from another.The tear-off is not very good quality, and I have lost a few bags in the process.As a result of the curved tear-off, the capacity of the bag is practically 2/3 now or perhaps even less.This is my LAST order to BAGS on BOARD. Hope the Bags on Board folks are reading this and revert to the old design.Someone really messed up there."
2,Bags on Board rating was poor,They changed in how you separate bags and on numerous occasions they bags tore apart so they were unusable. Probably would not purchase again.
4,Nice dollhouse furniture,"My daughter received this and two other sets for Christmas this year to use in her wooden castle. The furniture is very durable, even her 18 month old brother can use it and it won't break.The only thing I would suggest is gluing down the cushions to the chairs my daughter gets a little frustrated when they slip off."
1,not impressed,"this should be a disposable camera. it's fully made from a cheap plastic, the batteries keep popping out, the flash blows everything out to ghost white, the quality of the photos are similar to those $10 keychain cameras.very crappy. if i had spent $30 more, I could have bought an actual semi-decent camera."
1,Waste of Money,This camera has broken after being used about 5 times - the shutter no longer functions. The battery drains too quickly. The quality of the images is appalling. The manufacture of the camera is cheap and flimsy and the delay after pressing the shutter is ridiculous. The only thing that lasts a long time is the waterproof casing which will now be in a landfill as it only fits this camera.
3,Good starting point in the hobby,"Overall I think this kit is a good place to start if you're new to the hobby. It allows a nice introduction to assembly techniques without being overly intimidating.The truck itself looks nice but isn't very fast or durable. Once built as specified by the manual, you can expect speeds of 10 - 15 mph, and jumps of no more than 12 inches high.Be warned, if you're looking for fun right out of the box you'd be better off with the Traxxas XL-5 Stampede (or Rustler). They are both great trucks and offer lots of fun and value as well"
4,"Train Book for ""Thomas The Train"" DVD","We ordered this book as recommended with a ""Thomas The Train"" DVD. It is a little advanced for my 2 year old grandaughter, but she loves the pictures and story, and as she gets older will read it, I'm sure.It is good to see real trains added to the Thomas models. We have an active track 50 yards from our house. She loves them."
4,Weird Al's videos,"Never before in the history of man have such epic videos been assembled on one amazing home video release. On this tape are Jurassic Park, Bedrock Anthem, UHF, You Don't Love Me Anymore, and a few lil' extras. Weird Al's Jurassic Park video is beautiffuly done in CLAYMATION, something you don't see around anymore! Have fun with this video"
3,"Okay, but not particularly comprehensive","I purchased this book hoping that it would include a detailed explanation of how to build a fence; unfortunately, this book does not contain such details.What this book does include is a general explanation of fence building concepts, lots of colour photos, and some step-by-step photo sequences; however it is brief on different fence construction techniques, in part because it tries to focus on all types of fences: wood, metal, and plastic. There is a section on building a gate, but again, it's not very comprehensive. In my fence building, I relied more upon the experience of others, and on examining existing fences to understand how they were put together. That's not to say that this book was not useful; but it certainly left most of the research to be done elsewhere using this is a very high-level guide."
4,Helpful,Good basic information with drawings and photos to assist anyone who's planning to build or repair fencing around the house.
1,I did NOT like this book,"I didn't find this book inspirational at all. In fact it gave me nightmares. I realize that everyone has their own choices and that the Catholic Church believes that birth control is murder, but the book concentrated so much on women who had miscarriage after miscarriage instead of using birth control until they found whatever was wrong was disturbing. I'd say at least half of the stories, if not more, were about multiple miscarriages. I was also a bit disturbed that in one story after a couple's son dies they immediately try to have a replacement baby because they feel God wants that and if they hadn't used birth control their son would still be alive. I don't follow the line of reasoning. I do not recommend this book to anyone, even a die hard Catholic."
5,Groundbreaking experimental electronica with a theatrical feel,"What can I say. This album blew my mind. This is true underground. This artist, wherever he is and whatever he is doing now, deserves to succeed in a big way. I'm considering buying multiple copies of this album just to support him in his cause."
5,Good Little Cup!,"Nice finish, ribbing on bottom makes it less plain, stickers come off easily, can order the exact number that you want."
3,OK hitman action flick,This is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. I have always liked William Forsythe soI thought I would take a chance on this movie. The film has a decent story-line with Forsytheplaying a hitman with second thoughts about his last job. Forsythe is good in the roleas is George Segal playing his boss. I was not impressed with Jo Champa in the female lead.She's not much of a actress. This is not bad for the VOD rental price but there are quitea few other films with the same story-line which are much better.
5,Another Author Offers A Review,"I was fortunate enough to know Stanice before she wrote this book, when she sent out amazing weekly e-mails about her life. Each e-mail included a prayer and a Bible verse. I, along with many others, looked forward to receiving them. It was no surprise to me that she would write such an inspirational and powerful book. We have lived similar lives but Stanice has a unique framework in which she offers the reader her story of triumph over drugs and low self-esteem. This book will enrich your life, regardless of what your own personal challenge may be--Patrice Gaines, author ""Laughing In The Dark"""
5,Up all night! Can't put it down reading!,"I really enjoyed I say a prayer for me. The trials & tribulations was heartbending, but the end result of each story was amazingly spiritual. This book should hit the top of the charts. I am & will continue to recommend this book to family, friends & even strangers."
2,I Say A Prayer for Me: ONe Woman's Life of Faith And Triumph,The writer gives the impression that you can overcome herion addiction just by praying and becoming a member of the 700 club.
5,Prayer is the work,"I read Stanice's book, ""I Say a Prayer For Me"" and was instantly touched by the heart of her experiences that, although not like mine, were identical in their transforming qualities. I have since given at least 5 books to those I believe have very similar situations to Stanice and truly need to see just how beautiful and useful their lives can be because of their experiences. We must always seek to find God in the blueprints of trials and tribulations that He is preparing us for a work we cannot fathom. He makes no mistakes and cannot fail.I thank God for her brokeness, her boldness for Christ and her spirit to serve in whatever way God has deemed for her without shame, fear or doubt. Stanice is a blessing to me and her work is exactly what we need in a world that has turned its back on God and the written word.May God continue to grow her and those she comes to know and who come to know her.A very impressed sister-in-Christ,Sharon Tabb"
2,Not Solid Metal,"These sash lifts are made from stamped/folded sheet metal, not solid metal. The handles are hollow with a seam down the back. I ordered 20 and sent them back when I saw how flimsily they were constructed."
5,Removed the squeak,I purchased this to use on my truck's temperamental UCA's and they have resolved the squeaking like no other grease I have tried. Absolutely worth the money!
4,Good Condition,Nice devotional Bible. Was in very good condition. Read it to my kids at night before bed. They really like it.
3,Need more extensive story,"It's a great starter, it just leaves so much of what's in the bible out. Need more than one or two page of each book in the bible."
3,Thought it would have a daily verse,"It's cute the pictures and words are simple. Was hoping for a daily verse and pray...oh well...maybe I should write a daily devotional myself. (I am a preschool teacher, who continues to look for the perfect preschool Bible!)"
5,A great Bible for ages 4-8 years old!,I bought this Bible for my 5 year old daughter and am very impressed. I love anything from Karyn Henley. My daughter really enjoys being able to read her own Bible with simple words that are at her reading level. Highly recommend!
5,great starter book,Got this for my 6 year old she loves to hear the stories. Not to long and keeps her attention. She is learning to read some of these stories too.
4,"reat bible, but not as descriptive as I wanted.","I bought this bible because it covered so many bible stories. However, it covers so many stories, that they still leave out quite a bit of detail. I wish the stories were grouped together a little more and included a little more info! Otherwise...great bible!"
5,Love this kid's bible!,"My son is about to turn 5 and loves this bible. We bought it for him for Christmas a couple months ago and we read it almost daily. I love that the stories are in order and accurate, yet short and with pictures for a child. It is great for a preschooler who is learning the bible and learning to read!"
3,Funny,"Love Jennifer Aniston and Shirley Maclaine, so I took a chance. Jennifer and Shirley did not disappoint, but Kevin Costner's performance was awful. The premise was funny and overall it was an OK movie."
3,"Interesting, but ultimately disappointing","Like an earlier reviewer, I found this work disappointing. Having one consolidated source for lyrics is nice, but somewhat inconsequential. It's great to finally get lyrics to his 2nd album, but it's not enough. His intros to each chapter are too short to really provide more than a cursory perspective. The pictures are nice, but the lack of live performance shots is puzzling. His discussion of the Tunnel of Love, without mentioning his troubled relationship with his first wife, comes off as disengenous. I truly expected more. If you're a Springsteen fan, you have to buy this book. Just don't expect too much."
1,Love the Boss-This book not worth it.,"I am a huge Bruce Springsteen fan and a struggling songwriter so when I saw that there was a book written by Bruce himself about his feelings during the writing of his wonderful songs, I knew I had to buy it right away. The book is very thick but 90% of it is reprints of ALL of his lyrics with like one or two pages telling about what he was thinking during the conception of each album. If you skip over reading the numerous pages of lyrics, you'll be done reading this book in ten minutes! Bruce...you've brought us so much joy with your music but this book was very misleading and disappointing."
2,"Book damaged, return policy perfect","The book I ordered was second hand. This was not mentioned very well on the Amazon site; I really thought the book was new. It also turned out that the book was delivered by a third party, not being Amazon.com. That also was not mentioned very well on the site. So I was very disappointed when the book arrived! Fortunately, the return poliscy was perfect! I got my money back very fast. So my lesson was to look better when ordering a product at Amazon.com."
5,A look into Springsteen's soul,"In this coffee table book, Bruce shows us his heart and soul through his lyrics. Lots of great pictures, handwritten pages of lyrics, which show how some of his better known songs have evolved. A great book for all Springsteen fanatics to have."
3,"Okay, But Could've Been Better","I usaly don't read these types of book , but this was okay not the best but okay.If you liked this book then check out all of Bruce Springsteen's cd' Book, And Movies"
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased the two pack (V500-2) and within a week, tried both spray cans, BOTH did not spray. I read all info and tried again. No spray. I did hear liquid when shook.Junk product, waste of money!"
5,A Must Have For The Fox,"There are just so many different third-party companies that try to make out the very best strategy guides for so many different video games. Nevertheless, most of the time, they always fall flat on their face. It is just unfortunate. For Nintendo though, they definitely hit that nail on the head with official strategy guides for so many great video games. Star Fox: Assault is really no acception. This latest guide from Nintendo shows remarkably well no just in the maps, but in the complete detail of so many different maps for all 10 levels, and tips on how to unlock certain bonuses, including a hidden video game from the 80's, Xevious. This is definitely a must buy for anybody who wants to pilot this Star Fox team on this dynamic Gamecube landmark game.Maps: A-Price: AAssistance: AOverall: A"
5,"A must for all who have already bought Prego, the book :)","I have learned Italian at school with the book and I have used this cassette tape to help me with pronunciation and to get me used to real Italian speaking. This is the greatest book on Italian language I have come up to so far, and this cassette tape, I believe you wouldn't regret buying this ever. Now that I am finished with my first semester of Italian, this is helping me all the more for keeping me maintaining what I have learned!"
5,As close as you can get to actually being there.,I've seen Brother Henry a half-dozen times. They are such a great live band. I'm thrilled they release this live CD - from the famed The Basement in Nashville no less!!!The older tracks are great to hear interepreted with different arrangments and the added touch of spontaneity they get from a live treatment. The new tracks on this CD make are EXCELLENT!!! I can't wait to hear more new music from Brother Henry.
5,Worked very well,"My aged cat has a very sensitive stomach and she cannot eat most cat foods available. However, she has absoloutely no problems with this. Not once in all the months i've been feeding her this has she ever vomited in any way. Not to mention she's acting healthier and seems stronger on this brand.And she easily eats this dry without having to add any wet food to make it palatable. She clearly likes the taste.All in all I highly recommend this to anyone with a senior cat."
1,Orange dye comes off easily and the formulation itself is very drying,"I got the smaller, 'trial' size of this soap when I was on a trip and ran out of my regular soap.The orange dye comes off on white or light colored bathroom surfaces, as I found out, and the formula itself is pretty drying. The scent is light and pleasant but not worth it. Don't buy this."
3,Is there a sequel?,I thought this book was okay. I wonder if it has a sequel though since it just abruptly ended. I didn't like how Mr Clegg made the mother completely oblivious to her daugher's abilities. I understand she didn't believe in that stuff but to have the mother seem like she didn't even hear her own daugher talking about stuff was wrong.
1,Deplorable,"It sounded like a promising precept: the fabled psychic program of the US gov't during the Cold War. I expected something along those lines: exciting, conspiratorial, and action filled. No. This was the worst combination of gratuitous sex, midnight talk show and ""psychic"" reading of the crystal ball I have ever had the misfortune to pick up. The grammar was atrocious, and spelling was horrible all the way through. I forced myself to finish it (for the sake of reviewing it, if nothing else) and found the ending to be as climactic as a TV special on watching grass grow. Don't waste your time or money on this. I don't know if it was being set up for a sequel, but just let this program rest in the black files like it should.Sidenote: I've just finished another book by the same author, The Children's Hour. An excellent book, a brilliant read. I didn't care for this book, but the author is really quite talented. I strongly recommend trying one of Mr. Clegg's other works!"
3,Horror as it Should Be...Good But Not Among the Best,"This was an easy light read with moderate predictability and very open ending...the author leaves a lot to the imagination especially at that end, and I rather like that in an age where way too much is shown/detailed in books and movies. I've enjoyed a couple of books by this author and would certainly read more. This was more suspense to me than horror with the paranormal thrown in....and an interesting/fresh look at death. I give it a solid B+, it was interesting but didn't really creep me out the way I like to be when I read horror/suspense/thrillers."
2,Disappointed,"I'm new to Mr. Clegg but had heard good things, so I read Goat Dance and loved the writing style.Afterward I decided to read Afterlife after reading the sample. I hated the lead charter, she had tobe one of the most un-realistic personalities I've ever read. I felt the writing style of this book wasfar from the writing style in Goat Dance, I'm still having trouble believing this was written by the same man."
2,Not a good book!,"I really dislike giving bad reviews but this book needs some. It started out pretty good & I remained fairly interested for about 2/3 of it, but then it went nowhere fast! The protagonist was just plain irritating: whining about everything. It had some great reviews, in the book, by some authors I respect a lot - some of my favorites. This time they were wrong. I have never read a book by Mr. Clegg before, maybe I will try one more before deciding ""never again!""."
2,AFTERLIFE,I had high hopes for this book after reading the reviews. Very disappointing. I nearly stopped reading it several times but still hoped that there would be more to this book than graphic sex and psycho babble. The ending was incredibly lame and I still can't figure out where the 'horror' and 'thriller' parts were supposed to be. This was one boring book.
2,Not my favorite,"Out of a dozen, or so books that I have read from Douglas Clegg, this was my least favorite. Not a fan of the main character, and the story just didn't do it for me. If you want to read some other really good Clegg, check out the criminally insane series, The children's hour, Attraction, Halloween Man, etc..."
4,Titles a bit self-centered but the songs are nice,"I can't, I don't, Is it me, Don't be, ...never knew me, ...want from me? I think these lyrics were culled from a teen diary, but the songs are pretty nice nonetheless. Ok melodies and all that. You never knew me is fun. Sounds like a ballad speeded up, but fun anyway. Intoxicated sounds familiar... drawn from Natalie Imbruglia or somebody similar."
5,Grandson's favorite,"I know nothing about this, or other new Star War characters, but this figure was in my grandson's top favorite 5 list. Hard to rate. My grandson would give it 5 stars."
5,Legend,One of rap's greatest.If you've never heard of Fat Pat no need to read review.He was a legend in his time and remain a legend for years to come.A must get to add to collection.
4,DA MAN DAT DID IT ALL IN A SHORT TIME MY BOY,DIS WAS THE FIRST ALBUM BY PAT A TRU CLASSIC EVEN THO PAT DIDNT EVEN RAP ON MUCH OF IT THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM BUT I RECAMEND DAT GHETTO DREAMS A REAL 5 STAR ALBUM WITH FAT PAT BY HISELF R.I.P TO FAT PAT N DJ SCREW ILL NEVA 4 GET U N I KNOW NOBODY ELSE WILL EITHER WRECKSHOP N S.U.C 4 LIFE
5,REST IN PARADISE PLAYA..,WE'LL ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS R.I.P. TO A PLAYA WHO HELPED PUT TEXAS ON THE MAP..YOU MIGHT BE GONE BUT YOUR MEMORY LIVES ON.
1,Knock off from season 1,this is a knock off from season one. It does not show you the full show as it was played it takes a little from the orig and leaves out the rest. Not that good would not recomend it at all.
3,"Good cereal, high price","This is an excellent alternative to ""Cheerios"" brand for the GF diet. I think the Os are a little hard. One of my kids likes them, one does not."
2,YUK!,Bought this cereal at the Store. Does not taste like nut and honey. Very disappointed. Just tastes like they used cheap ingredients. Will not buy again.
1,Not Good,"This cereal is high in calories, has essentially no fiber or significant nutrients, and does not have either good taste or texture. The serving size is 1/2 cup and packs 120 calories for that small amount. I'm returning mine."
1,"ick, ew, yuck, gross","wow-threw this away after one bite. chemical, sticky sweet smell. the cereal is translucent.WOW.....I will stick with G-Free Chex. light years better than this."
2,Are the Reviewers for real?!!,"When I read the reviews on the products...I like to believe there is some truth to it. But serious...this cereal just taste awful! This was another gluten free product I tried based on the many positive reviews. It's called ""Honey Nut"", am I correct?!! Yet it tasted like...I can't even discribe the words. Nothing like I ever tasted? Is it just me? Had to give half of my boxes away. What a waste of money. I'm getting so disappointed in this new gluten free stuff. I think I'll just switch back to my NORMAL foods. Can anyone out there make anything gluten free that isn't disgusting!!! Come on."
2,Not the spray as advertised,I ordered this product thinking it was the spray. What I received was Spedo Anti-Fog Solution. 2.6 oz UPC 638950138476. So far it hasn't worked very well either.
3,Not as good as other products available,"This spray is frustrating, more difficult to use than liquid drops products because of the ""allow to airdry"" part of the instructions. This doesn't allow me to use it last minute before getting in the water, and thinking ahead isn't always my strong suit! :) If I don't allow to airdry, it is almost useless.The spray isn't as good as the various liquid drops I've used, but is definitely better than nothing. It seems to work pretty well for the first 1/4 mile swim (ocean) but then I have to wet my goggles every 1/8 mile or so to be fog free. I haven't used it for pool swimming, so perhaps better performance could be seen there...It does seem to work nicely for snorkeling - less exercise means less heat, therefore less fog."
2,Its better than nothing,"It helps a little bit, but by no means eliminates fogging of your swim goggles . . . even when I leave it sit on them for 10 minutes."
3,it works for a while,"I use the solution for my speedo swim google, and I do following the instruction. The swim google come back to anti-fog at first. But after I swam for 30 minutes, it didn't work."
1,Good Idea But Does Not Work,"Purchased this for my son who is a competitive swimmer. Followed the directions, but goggles still fogged up. Speedo merchandise is usually high quality and lives up to its billing, this is the exception."
1,doesn't help,"tried using the product exactly as prescribed. (spray & leave for 30 sec, rinse with water, let dry)after 10 laps it started fogging up again. Doesn't seem to work.."
5,"Not a spray...description should be changed to ""drops""",But they work very well. Follow the directions carefully and your goggles will be clear. :)
3,NO need to spend on this... go with Shampoo,"I bought this solution to see if I could swim at least for 5 mins without getting fog on my speedo vanquisher 2.0.I tried several things to see if it worked:1) Few drops in the googles, wait for 2 mins, rinse: no results. Googles got foggy after 3 mins.2) Few drops in the googles, wait for 10 mins, rinse: same thing.3) Few drops in the googles, wait for 30 mins, rinse: this worked much better than the other 2 tries, but after 10 mins, foggy googles.But one day I tried the baby shampoo on the googles... and voila! issue resolved. I was able to swim for almost 30 mins without having to take off my glasses to get the fog out.I still believe my googles are not the best, but at least with shampoo and rinsing them just before getting into the pool it's working like a charm.I dont recommend buying this product. Not needed. Go with shampoo"
1,Didn't work,I was having lots of fogging on my goggles. I purchased this product thinking surely it would help. It didn't work. I still have lots of fogging on my goggles.
3,Not worth the money,"Frustrated with wiping, drying, and spitting, I bought this anti-fog spray. I can't really tell the difference when I use it. Getting a good, quality pair of goggles seems to be the best way to limit fog."
2,didn't work as I had hoped,I bought the anti-fog spray for my glasses when I play tennis. I sprayed my glasses and had a hard time cleaning the glass after I sprayed. And my glasses fogged up almost as badly as before I used the product. Bummer
3,"Good product, bad service","I use them for swimming in the pool, and they are fine. I spray them on, give a quick rinse, then dry the googles, except for the lenses.I ordered 3 from amazon. One leaked. I complained in several emails. They never replaced the bad bottle."
1,"Bad delivery timeline, inventory control, and customer support","Bad delivery timeline. Terrilbe inventory control system and internal communication. Does not care about customers' preference. Can substitute your item for something else without asking you for your prference. Terrible customer support, especially from this person named Bruno Diederichs. They expect you to pay for their mistakes."
1,I thought it was 'anti' fog?,"This is more like 'Speedo Fog Solution'.Great if you swim and are deathly afraid of seeing the bottom of the pool. One dose of this and POOF, no more bottom of the pool. In fact, you can't even see your arms so you can rest assured that you will be swimming in a small little bubble of fog.Until you hit the end of the pool with your head."
1,No sound?,"I just received this movie and though it plays in my DVD player, there is no sound? I put it in my DVD player of my laptop and it says it cant load because it doesnt match my region? Any clue?"
2,The McClintock Myth,"""A Feeling for the Organism"" is much closer to memoir than biography. When McClintock denied Keller access to her letters and notebooks, Keller chose to rely on McClintock's recollections. Consequently, we learn how McClintock wanted others to see her, and perhaps how she wanted to see herself, but not the truth. McClintock is portrayed as a genius struggling against a world too stupid to appreciate her brilliance, but the existence of transposition was never in serious doubt; it was McClintock's theory of genetic control that was controversial, and later discarded as incorrect. For a better understanding of McClintock's work and its reception, read The Tangled Field by Nathaniel Comfort, which manages to tell the real story without diminishing the scientific importance or originality of McClintock."
4,Bit wordy...,"Bare in mind as I begin this review that I am not interested in science. I read this book as part of a philosophy course interested in ""ways of seeing."" We looked at this books to discuss scientific ways of seeing and the fact that McClintock saw scientific things that her colleagues didn't see. The book is very interesting, if a bit wordy, and would probably be fascinating to someone actually interested in the topic. If you need to know about the life and work of Barbara McClintock- then the title does not lie. This book will give you a very in depth look at the woman's life and struggles and triumphs."
5,Don't worry about lost grip on your nose.,It stays tight on your nose and does not lose its tightness like other nose clips I have had.
2,Does not work for me,"I am a ""big guy"", however have a pretty standard nose. I purchased this one and another one called Smileys (built for kayakers). Neither one would close my nose off completely and were uncomfortable to wear. I have sleep apnea and use a cpap machine. I am a mouth breather when sleeping and was attempting to adjust one of my masks to be used as an oral device, so I needed to ""plug off"" my nose to prevent air leakage. Needles to say I am still looking."
4,Just what you would expect,I bought this nose clip for my 10 year old son. It has worked well as evidenced by the fact that he continues to wear it when he swims.
1,Worth 99 cents,Terrible product. I had several pair in the past but they have really cheapened this product. The wire is so thin and flimsy. The rubber wont hold to your nose. Every flip turn I do the pop off half down the lane. I suspect they are made in China. Disappointing coming from Speedo.
2,"Slips off, Not cute","In addition to being a hideous color, these squeezed my already small nose to resemble Michael Jackson's non-existant nose. I was self concious to wear them and my boyfriend refused to look at me with them on. These helped a bit at first but kept slipping off eventually. I don't know where they are now. Probably at the bottom of a pool somewhere. :("
2,Uncomfortable,"I tried losening them but still weren't comfortable. They function as designed, just not comfortable with something blocking my nose. Try holding your nose between 2 fingers. If this is comfortable, you'll probably like the product."
3,Not for short noses!,"I am Asian and have a fairly short, flat-ish nose so these nose clips really don't work at all for me. I gave it 3 stars though because I don't think it's fair to judge them by my nose type since they work pretty well for my friends. But when it comes down to it, I can't use these at all (I've really tried multiple times) because the pinchy part comes down below the end of my nose when I try to put them on correctly. So they'll work for about a half-lap before they slide off. If you have a short nose like mine, I wouldn't recommend these clips. I use the case for my earplugs now!"
4,Ultimately this ended up being my choice.,I went through a lot of nose clips. Most just ended up slipping or sliding on my nose once they were wet. They all felt fine when the face was dry. I had given up on these as I had the same problem with these like the others. My instructor insisted I try these again. I did and had problems but eventually got it adjusted to the point that these are the ones that stayed on the best for me. They aren't the most comfortable of the ones I tried but they stay on my nose and gives me less to worry about as most of the others I tried felt like they were going to come off.
5,Speedo swimmers nose clips,These are the best nose clips you can get for swimming or diving. Made by Speedo.
5,hands free swimming,this product is great now I no longer have to hold my nose with one hand and swim with the other. I get to swim with both of my hands and have a hole lot more fun.
5,Fascinating Myths For Astrologers and Non-Astrologers,"I absolutely adore this book. It has become one of my all time favorites for research and pure pleasure. As an astrologer with a consuming interest in mythology, I am in awe of the author's depth of knowledge of both subjects. However, it's not just Kaldera's impeccable scholarship and amazing astrological insight that draws me back to his wonderful book again and again. More than anything, it's the fascinating and eminently readable tales of gods and goddesses from various cultures and diverse pantheons. I must confess that each time I reread a portion of MythAstrology (which is really quite often) I can't help but wish that I had written it. Highly Recommended."
3,Used for Wedding Unity Sand Ceremony,"The sand is of a fine grade and is appropriate for a unity sand ceremony. However, the sand does settle. I had it in a vase for several hours before the actual ceremony took place. During the ceremony, the last 20% of the sand got stuck in the vase and did not come out. It was a little embarrassing, but all of it eventually came out after some slight shaking of the vase."
3,It's Sandtastik,"I ordered this because I thought it would be pure white sand, but it's not even officially the company's item. It's Sandtastik, which you can find sold by other venders for cheaper. They need to re-label what they're selling. The sand is an off white and a pretty cheap quality used for kids decorations."
5,Great!,I could not find any orange sand anywhere locally. I ordered this from Amazon and it appeared promptly at my door as scheduled. Thank you.
5,Nice color,As described and nice color. I own a wedding service and my clients requested a certain color and this was perfect. As described.
2,"Might be good, but who knows?",The DVD is in Chinese. It does not say that anywhere in the discription of the DVD.If you speak the language have fun and let us know what you think.
3,Good basic text but not for beginners,"The major flaw of this dictionary is that it fails to give a phonetic rendering of the Farsi words, which is a rather fundamental characteristic of any dictionary."
5,Great and Sturdy,"My kids love this. Fits their house perfect. I would have sewn the bedding shut, but it is not really a problem. Highly recommend."
5,A Great Collection,"This collection houses the best of (or at least MOST of the best of) H.G. Wells's work. His three undeniably classic novels are here: The Time Machine, The War of The Worlds, and The Invisible Man. All early science fiction classics that still stand up today. Indeed, they do more than that, they put most of today's SF to shame. Also included is the notoriously underrated and controversial Island of Dr. Moreau, which is a very thought-provoking read, and one of Wells's best books. Also included is the good, but not great short story The Crystal Egg. A must read for any Wells fan."
2,interesting but immature,"A wildly inconsistent book. A few of the stories are wonderful; some read like transcribed dreams. He's an ambitious and imaginative writer, but in this (early?) work, he could have used a stricter editor."
2,Just One Huge List,I agree with several of the other reviews that there isnt much in terms of creativity or inspiration in this book. You'd do much better getting ideas at TheRomantic. com or some other website.
2,1001 Ways to be Romantic,"Amazon's service was great, but I'm not really impressed with this book. Lots of way too obvious and trite ideas, and a lot of really expensive ones."
3,Lots of Fluff,"This is a big book. Almost too big to carry. You would think that it would be filled with 1001 great ideas. Right? Not quite. I swear but half of the ideas revolve around chocolate, roses or jewelry. There is some good stuff in here, but it is hidden among a lot of fluff.Personally I found The Romantic's Guide to be much better. It is smaller in size but actually have a lot more useable content."
2,Some good some bad,How about a book of 101 of the best ways to be romantic. Some great ideas but most seems to be filler.
2,Tell me something I don't know,I guess this is a good book for people who have no clue on how to be a nice guy. It really falls short in the creativity department. You wont find any novel ideas in this book.
5,Amazing ideas,"If you're creative, you are probably not looking for this book. If you are not, this is an amazing resource chock full of ideas for keeping the romance alive in your marriage. Even if you are creative, I guarantee you will find ideas that you have yet to dream up. It's great for sparking creativity and fun - I highly recommend it!"
3,A bit better than average,"Some of this book is outstanding. Other parts are horrid and just plain boring. I'd like to see a ""best of"" instead of someone trying to be the ""biggest"" book."
1,"please brotha, spare us the details","I thought this was going to be a romantic guide to enhancing a relationship but all I got was the autobiography of a cheesy womanizer Mr Peck. Who objectifies women in the relationship and thinks he can win them over by annoying them with pieces of paper everyday(birthday cards, comics, i love you notes ugh) and sucking up to them and giving them roses and chocolates and the whole 9 yards. Relationships go much deeper than the superficial way it does as this book shows, it's just cashing in on what society says about love and sex anyways. Any fool off the street could write this book or even send it as attachments to their friends as a joke. This book is a joke. If you really are in need of tips, why not just grab a pen and a paper and come up with the craziest, wackiest ideas to impress someone you like or are with; cause gregory pretty much did the same thing in this book."
2,Over Rated,"I was expecting this fantastic book of great ideas on presents and dates and fun things to do with my sweetheart. Instead, it almost read like a book full of advertisements of all the things you could buy or vacations you could take. I returned it."
3,A little bit of romance,"Some of the material was wonderful but why in the world does this book include long lists of movies, books and tv shows? Too many ideas cost too much money. Not all of us have thousands of dollars to spend on dates and vacations."
1,"Very, very, very bad, indeed","Amazon.com is such a pleasure to deal with. The representatives are courteous, helpful, and accomodating. I had the pleasure to experience this myself when I was returning this piece of trash. Mr. Godek came up with a dozen or two ""o.k."" (but nothing extraorinary) ideas and filled up the rest of the space with quintessential garbage. My fellow Amazon customer, I wish you all the best because, like me, you are on the path to becoming a true romantic for the woman you love. That's very noble, and I couldn't respect that more. That's why I say to thee: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND NERVE CELLS! This book is not the one you need. Allow me to recommend another one: ""How to Romance the Woman You Love - The Way She Wants You To."" By Lucy Sanna and Kathy Miller. The ISBN is 0761508708. Good luck."
2,Boring,"Warning. This book is pretty big. Too big in fact. While there is some good material in this book, the majority of it seems to be lists of favorite songs, romantic movies or phone number of cruise ships. Lots of ""romantic"" quotes throughout but not many good ideas on how to be romantic -- isn't that what this book is supposed to be about?"
1,I returned it!,"I returned it the same day. First of all it is written basically for men. It had a women's only chapter a page and a half long. It assumed that all men are into sports. And it suggests things to do like ""Do something you hate to do that your sig other likes."" True Love and romance aren't compromises or sacrifices. Instead they require Understanding and thoughtfulness. Some of the ideas in this book are G for given (basic). You have to be totally out of tune with your romantic self to get help from this book. Spend the cash on a flowers and candy instead."
1,Where's the idea's for the women????,"I read the book after hearing about it on a near by radio station..... I thought it was ""a must have"" I was wrong, I can be more creative on my own. My fiance likes me for who I am not what I try to get from a book. And where is the section for women??? I was not satisfied at all"
3,Book,"Not a bad book, I initially bought as a gag gift for my husband nut then I ended up reading it myself. Book was in brand new condition no stains of any sort"
3,Could be better,The book is really good. Has a lot of nice ideas. The content is well organized and will inspire you to get your own ideas. The bad thing is the way it looks in a tablet. The e-book version lost all the pictures and diagrams. This makes the paperback version much better than the electronic.
3,Doesn't go far enough,I agree with Ghandi that it took a lot of courage to make this film dealing with two sexually taboo social issues like homosexuality and child rape. The groom-to-be is an introspective young beauty while his pal is a flaming over-the-top/hot-to-trot drama queen who should have been given the opportunity to explore his homosexual cravings at the bachelor wedding party. Sadly the quick sex tease between Farfat and the other erotic male dancer in that scene ends in violence and death.
2,Worthless,Appalling and boring. Lame and pointless. Nothing more deserves to be said about this pathetic movie. I give two stars only for the cultural interest about Tunisian lifestyle. Period!
2,Works but will break,This will work for a while and the price is low. Good temporary item.If you have any plans of using it frequently or for more than a year get an all brass one. The plastic valve handle parts will break. Mine all have.
1,Beware,"I know every dog is different, but I have to put a warning out there about these treats. I bought them a few weeks ago from my local pet store for my 5 month old Golden Retriever. I broke one treat up into tiny pieces to use as a training treat in the morning. By lunch time my dog had terrible diarrhea. She was fine that evening, ate and drank as normal and didn't have any more diarrhea. The next morning I gave her 1/2 of a treat during our training sesson. Again at lunch time terrible diarrhea. I summated it was from the treats and threw the rest away. She has been fine since."
1,Unsafe!!!,This product as well as several others has been determined it is made in China and has caused several health issues in Dogs up to and including death. I have personally had experience with these products with my dogs and have vet bills to prove it. I strongly recommend to NOT use their products or any other that can not show they are exclusively made in The USA. This is a recommendation link with products (...)
1,These suck,Don't waste your money - the quality is awful - they are unwatchable.See similar review for Ultimate John Wayne Collection.
2,"Black-n-White, Lousy Video/Audio, but it IS The Duke!","Black and white OLD, OLD, OLD movies. ""The Duke"" looks like a kid! These are like the first ""talkie"" movies, or something. Quite odd, really. There are limited sound effects, and no music to set the ""mood"". (It's amazing how much difference that subtle ""mood"" music makes!) The stunts are cheesy, the dialog predictable and forced. And the movies are SHORT - 55 minutes on some of 'em!All that said, it *IS* John Wayne and if you know what you're getting into, for the price, these disks are a bargain."
4,The Duke,"I gave this set to my husband for Valentines day, he's a huge John Wayne fan. He was very happy with the set. He's looking forward to watching some of the movies he's not seen before."
2,"The Duke, But a lot or them have been edited",I found this and jumped on it. As already stated the Lone Star movies are old and they have not been restored. [Package says Digitally remastered] The worst thing is that they have been edited. Most [not all] of the run times are from 2 to 7 minutes short. On a movie that last only 55 to 59 minutes that can change the movie. I bought this for RAINBOW VALLEY. This movie's original runtime was 52 minutes. On this DVD it runs 47 minutes.If you are trying to collect the full movie pass this by. If you don't care and want to watch some classic Duke it's a good price.Too bad they spent more on packaging it than they did on production.
4,A Collection of Old John Wayne Westerns,"With the exception of ANGEL AND THE BADMAN (1947) and MCLINTOCK (1963), all of the John Wayne westerns in this collection date from the 1930's.Judging by the fact that most of these movies, when listed individually on Amazon, have zero or one Amazon review, it is fair to say that they are not well known. For this reason, this 20-movie collection is a treasure of sorts.Several reviewers have already pointed out that the movies here are abridged. Indeed, this can be annoying. For instance, those familiar with the original version of MCLINTOCK will recognize that a funny part had been edited out.There is also included an interesting documentary by John Ford. In it, John Wayne speaks as himself, and comments on his roles in westerns."
2,Awfully Bad Quality,"The quality of this DVD is wildly bad NOT because as one reviewer put, the film prints are some 70 years old.Those film prints are still fine. It's just terrible compression. The image is dark and blurry, you see the pixels. It's a bit like someone made DVD copies of VHS tapes. In other words, super cheap.But, hey, I suppose if you get 20 films for $5, you can't complain. And it's not like you can't make out the story. Still, it would be nice if Amazon could at least acknowledge the low quality here."
4,John Wayne Value,The collection was a gift to a big John Wayne Fan...she thought it was awesome...for the money a great bang for the dollar..a great value!
1,Gun Control & Wife Abusers' fantasies.,"I only saw two of these movies in the set. The first is Angel and the Bad Man. That was pretty cute basically, except the toss-away-your-weapons pacifist message - the Duke gives up guns for the Quaker girl - isn't one I agree with. The second movie was McClintock. The basic message seemed to be that women are irrational, verbally abusive nutcakes. But no problem!Just humilitate them in public, give them a hard spanking with some kind of metal instrument, (couldn't tell which kind) and they will transform into little obedient lambs. McClintock passses on his ""paddle"" to be used by his daughter's fiance.On the other hand, the frequently drunk, carousing husband doesnt' show any remorse or signs of changing himself.I am not going to watch the rest of the movies in this series. But if McClintock is an example of what any of the others are like, I think this dvd set should be placed in the genre of ""Scary Stuff."""
4,John Wayne 20 movie pack,"This is a great preservation of John Wayne, at such a price. I am glad I bought it. The movie listed are offeredeslewhere at higher price, so I think it is a good deal.Most of the movie are in right quality for the time they were made and the audio qulity also is wonderful, wish they have some more of other great names."
4,nice collection poor quality on some,This is a nice collection of his earlier films and the American West of John Ford documentary but McLintock has at least one scene cut out of it. The one where Stefanie Powers and Van Dyke sing together in the parlor. That part is cut out. Otherwise nice.
1,bad quality discs,"I bought this set, watched it once, and put it on the shelf for a year. The next time I took it down the DVD layers had separated and it would not play. This was no bargain at any price."
4,John Wayne becoming John Wayne,"I gobbled up these movies and fast. And craved more, they are fun. I mostly enjoy watching John Wayne grow into the character we know him as. Love those roundhouse punches and that swagger. Gabby Hayes is a blast too. These are real gems and I now plan to grab up all the B&W; John Wayne movies. But don't trust my word as my grandfather and the Duke are old aquaintances from Yuma AZ. so my opinion is biased. You will have to buy them yourself and see.Jim Peake"
4,A lot of bang for the $ mom loved it!,"I'm not a big JW fan, but my mom appreciated this. Quality is better then you think."
4,The Compelling Human Face of Systematic Destruction,"This account of the ordered destruction of a Jewish community takes dry statistics and puts real faces and names on people that could have been grandparents and relatives. The hardest part to comprehend is that the murders were carried out by former neighbors and friends, not the Germans. Originally read for family history research, but after finding stories and faces of what once were just names on a genealogical chart, has personalized the Holocaust as never before experienced. This book is an honor to the memory of those who perished and a testimony to those who survived under unbelieveable odds and to now have the courage to tell this story. A must read to understand what went on outside of the walls of the concentration camps throughout Europe."
2,SQUEAK - clunk - SQUEAK - clunk - SQUEAK - clunk......,"I hate using this thing. It not only makes a ton of noise, and I have sprayed it liberally in all areas using a quality dry lubricant made specifically for exercise equipment, but the motion is stiff and jerky no matter how much you adjust the knob. It also has a tendency to tip backwards if you happen to not have your feet all the way forward on the treads. I wish I had saved the packaging so I could return it. I also wish I had seen these latest negative reviews before I bought and not only that I paid way more just a few weeks ago than what it costs today. Just a totally disappointing experience no matter how I look at it. Shame on companies like Fitness Quest for putting such garbage out on the market and taking people's hard earned money away from them for nothing in return. I'll be taking this along on my next Goodwill run. If I had to say anything positive about this item it would be that it looks nice and you can use it barefoot."
5,You Can Train Your Horse to do Almost Anything!: On Target T,"Incredible! I just recently heard of this method so I bought the book. I applied the method to a 10 year old mare who had the following problems: Hard to catch, high strung, generally rotten disposition, scared to stand for the stallion, the list goes on. I am NOT a horse trainer, but the mare was headed for an uncertain future, so I figured I'd give this a try. Within our first two weeks she in now easy to catch and comes on the run when she sees me in or near her pasture. She willingly picks up her feet for farrier work, will back up straight for 35 feet on a voice command given from 10 feet away (no halter), she calmly follows me around the yard without restraint - even when we stroll past the stallion's gate. Within the next week she will be ridden for the first time and I expect, with her new calmness, she will return to the broodmare band in the spring."
5,Great Book for a Basic Lessons in Operant Conditioning,"If you have had no experience with 'clicker training' this book is an excellent source of basic information, giving both theory and many step by step instuctions for lessons. Covers basic lessons in manners such as saddling, trailer loading, giving confidence to nervous horses,picking up feet etc., as well as lessons in lunging, first riding, jumping and more. Relies heavily on target training (which is probably why their method is called ""ON TARGET TRAINING"")"
5,Excellent ideas conveyed easily in this book.,I found this book to be very easy to read and informative. It reinforced my ideas. The book made a great deal of sense that anybody can agree with.
1,Do not buy!,I use this book to teach my students at school. It is full of typos and the chapter material does not relate to the case studies at the end of each chapter. DO NOT BUY!
3,Fetish Fever Falling Flat on its Face,"The cover of the book is far more powerful than the actual content, which is rather tame and evasive. Steve Diet Goedde manages to drag down Fetish to a mundane, almost evasive level. Some images are interesting, and the overall presentation good, but the models appear like unhappy housewives or spinsters. They allude to loneliness and boredom rather than mystery and excitement. I simply expected more from this book, especially after reading the ""all-praising"" reviews. A few pictures are skillfully composed, but the overall effect comes well short of indulging the reader in the fascinating world of Fetish."
5,Highly erotic,"This book is amazing! In my opinion, Steve Diet Goedde is the only true successor to Helmut Newton. What makes his work stand out is his intellectual and honest approach towards alternative sexuality. Unlike other photographers in the fetish world whose images rely on subject matter, Goedde's images are powerfully artistic. He replaces the explicit with an ethereal romance while retaining the sexuality of his subjects. Plus, he has a sense of the actual art of photography which is rare in the fetish mainstream. His images will stick in our collective cranium for years to come."
1,Pretty --- but pretty boring!,"Although striking in form - very good paper, excellent printing quality - this book really loses in contents. The term ""fetish"" is reduced to (reasonaby nice) women in black rubber in not very imaginative settings ... and that's all! The much better alternative are the photo books by Eric Kroll, Roy Stuart or Richard Kern. Better buy these and don't waste your money on this one..."
4,Just what I needed,Bought for a project creating mini humidifiers for my guitar cases (using film canisters with holes in them and damp sponges in each. Success.
3,Giant bone sponge.,Thought it would be bigger. It's just a normal sponge. Thought it would be more dense and not tear so easy for the price.
5,Great Deuter,"The title says it all, perfect sunny day material. The music is interesting all the way through."
4,Child was delighted,This was given as a Christmas gift and my niece was delighted with it. It is the kind of toy that will still be played with long from the day it is received.
4,Good Workout but Difficult Choreography!,"I did this workout for the first time this morning. I found it frustrating because I think the choreography is a little complex. However, I do think once I get the choreography down I will enjoy it. I was sweating throughout the workout even though I messed up quite a bit. I will say that I didn't enjoy this workout nearly as much as Strike Zone but it is still a very good workout. You have to do multiple combinations. You learn them each and repeat them several times. At the end you have to put all of the combinations together and I had a hard time remembering them once I moved on to the next one."
1,half a book,"Horrible book. Publisher simply left out 2 chapters(approx 75 pages), even though they were listed in table of contents. Replacement book was sent with exact same problem. Poor quality from the publisher."
2,Tami G,not at all what I was expecting. Really thought it was a book. They are cards with ideas for the beach. Just wasn't practical for our group trip to Mexico.
5,"Overall it was a great book, I want to read the next one.",I LOVE CLUB STEPHANIE! THEY ARE SUCH GOOD BOOKS! I WANT TO READ THE NEXT ONE CAUSE THE LAST ONE LEKT ME HANGING WITH QUESTIONS
4,Yar. would be fantastic without caraway seeds,"positives:* hearty, whole grain (it is hard to find gluten-free products that aren't like white flour)* great texture - airy enough while still being substantial* bakes up great* easy to make (there isn't even any kneading)negatives:* caraway seeds- I like caraway seeds but this mix both 1. has too many caraway seeds and 2. the caraway seeds give it a very distinctive flavor that lowers the diversity of uses for this bread; E.g. I would not use this for French toast, many different kinds of sandwiches, toast with anything sweet on it* pretty high fat content for bread, although it is mostly pretty good fatwithout the caraway seeds I would say this is the best gluten-free bread, but with them I am simply not going to buy it again.UPDATE: I bought this again as my neighbor (who has now gone gluten free) LOVES it. So I upgraded the review to 4 stars (from 3)"
5,"No one at the party knew it was ""special"" bread!","I made one loaf of this bread in my bread machine to take to a party hosted by a friend who is gluten intolerant. We cut it up to serve & everyone loved it. No one could tell it was ""special"". It was hearty & delicious. I hope that some was left for the host to have later."
4,Great taste,This is the only gluten free bread that I have found that I really like. I prefer whole grains and this passes the test.
5,"If you haven't tried Bob's Red Mill GF Whole Grain Bread Mix, you are missing out!!","This bread product is wonderful, even my not gluten free husband likes it. I bake for another person who doesn't care forall the seeds but knows it is nurishing so I use 2 gluten free pantry sandwich bread mixes to 1 Bob's Red Mill Gluten-FreeWhole Grain bread Mix, mix them together and it is perfect for those who want a taste of both. I personally like the mix allby itself, so crunchy, makes great toast, sandwiches or just eat it alone w/butter.I would recommend this product, tastes like a pumpernicle bread w/nuts and seeds!!! Love it!!"
1,Bob's Gluten-Free Whole Grain Bread Mix,"I don't know what it was about this bread mix, but it didn't seem to agree with my stomach. It's very nutty and smells like a rye bread, but I could only eat about half of the loaf - then had to throw the rest away. I wish there were more options for whole grain gluten-free bread mixes. For now I'll be sticking with Pamela's."
2,Bob should call it rye bread mix.,"First, let me start by saying we love Bob's Mill products. I bought this mix thinking it would be a whole grain bread, suitable for breakfast. The taste is more like 'rye' bread, and not at all what I was expecting. It might be fine for sandwiches, if you like rye bread, but we don't."
1,Not good,I unfortunately purchased 2 cases of this mix. I threw away the first batch that I made-smelled and tasted horrible. I added some cinnamon and raisins to the second batch and it was edible-but still disapointing. It has a very strange smell and taste. I am stuck with it now and will just dispose of the remaining bags of mix. I purchased this because of the company's good reputation.
1,Made a decent bread...but,"It tasted awful. The other reviews were right. WAY TOO MANY SEEDS. Also being celiac, diagnosed in 1996, I really miss rye bread. This was nothing close to it. I'll have to try another brand :("
3,"Acceptable, but not great","The yeast did not foam, but the dough did rise in about an hour. The bread has strange texture, sort of like corn bread. The taste is fair when you toast it. I would not order it again."
4,Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Bread Mix,"I found this bread mix to be very tasty and easy to slice. The only thing we did not like was the way it came out of the bread maker, which may not be the fault of the mix. The bread maker did not mix it up well which caused some of the mix to come out of the machine dry and not mixed in. I plan to try it again using a smaller amount of the mix in my bread maker and hopefully it will all cook."
1,Brick bread is back,"I normally like red mill. The quality is quite good. But this harkens back to the brick bread of the seventies. I couldn't get it to rise. It tasted good, in a brick like way. Unfortunate."
5,I like Bob's REd Mill Whole grain bread mix,"I have used Bob's Red Mill Whole Grain Bread Mix several times. However, I found that if you add some dried onions,about 1/4 cup and some garlic powder it makes a delicious onion bread that I like much better."
3,Not my favorite.,"This bread has a pretty strong taste that reminds me of rye bread. I don't care for rye bread, so this is not my choice of the breads available. My husband likes it, but he also likes rye bread. Just a matter of taste!"
4,good product,This is a really good gluten free product. It is very moist and doesn't crumble. It's also really easy to make in either the oven or bread machine.
3,Not what I expected - more like rye,"I will preface this by stating this is not a bad product. I will also take the blame perhaps for not researching well enough, but this was nothing of what I expected. I expected a nice hearty brown multigrain bread. What I was shocked to find out was, with the carraway and such, this tastes much more like a rye bread than a multigrain. So if you want something with spice and punch go for it, if you just want a hearty multi-grain -- look elsewhere."
5,Good bread!,"I first made this bread (Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Whole Grain Bread Mix, 20-Ounce Units (Pack of 4)) in my bread machine for a friend who is on a gluten-free diet.I liked it so much that I now regularly make it for dinner parties, in preference to ""normal"" whole wheat bread - and receive rave reviews.Thoroughly recommended!"
2,Not the best :(,"I tried this because I love Bobs Red Mill white bread. However, I did not like this at all :( It tasted a lot like rye bread (I hate rye bread) and is VERY dense. Not my favorite."
4,An entertaining introductory volume.,"I found this book very informative and entertaining. The costume information is voluminous, the illustrations are clear, and there are brief historical notes on the famed personages plus amusing anecdotes. There are also contemporary quotes on fashion and behavior.As a more knowledgeable friend warned, some of the drawings are affected by the fashions of Norris' era, and the few primary-source illustrations are black and white. Bibiographical references are sadly lacking.However, it is overall a pleasant introductory volume on Tudor clothing."
4,Basics with an open mind,"This was my 2nd book from Norris and his style does take you back. If you read the introductions you see that it is a book about Norris as an expert sighting himself. What you get is a rambling sometimes difficult to follow read BUT... you also get an incredible amount of information on how his genire viewed the fashions. You understand how the myths for the period got started and why. You get visuals of all kinds. Men's,women,lace,braids, trims... they may not be in any order but...The plates,pictures and references can lead you to where you want to go on the internet or in the library AND give you all the inspiration you need to start something in your studio!I can't live without this one! Keep an open mind and study study study."
1,Horribly inaccurate!!,"Herbert Norris' based his books off of the Victorian views of the middle ages and renaissance... not the time periods themselves. What he could not derive from the Victorians, he just made up. In addition, his redrawings are much changed from the originals. If you want to make a halloween costume that has a medieval or renaissance ""feel"" to it, go ahead and purchase this book. However, if you are a historical costumer or are interested in accuracy at all, buy this book only if you want a paperweight."
3,Its virtues outweigh its flaws,"For dedicated scholars of costume, Norris's book is irritating for two reasons: he seldom lists the sources of his beautifully drawn illustrations, making it difficult to assess their accuracy, and he packs his text with rambling digressions into history and historical anecdotes of dubious authenticity. However, you will never find so much information about Tudor costume for people from all ranks and all walks of life in any other place (especially not for such a low price), and Norris's wonderful black-and-white drawings illuminate for the discerning reader how some of the magnificent ensembles depicted by Van Dyke and Hilliard must have been made. By all means buy this book if you have any interest in Tudor costume, but check Norris against dated sources first if your objective is museum-quality recreation."
4,RenFaire Enthusiast and Costume Designer,"I found this book to be a superb resource for designing and constructing Tudor period clothing. I agree with other reviewers that his ramblings can be distracting at times, but the entertainment and interest value overcome the drawbacks. The accessories shown in drawings are superb resources for hair styles and equipages used by Faire Cast persons. Once you have the vision of what you want, there are other sources available to tell you the ""how to"", this book is primarily a vision book...and a grand one, indeed. If you are interested in Renaissance Faires as a Cast member or a member of the Needleworker's Guild then this book is well worth purchasing."
1,would be good but.......,i wanted to try these memory fit insoles but when i recieved them it was the wrong ones and i was very dissapointed
5,Quality remains the same,We've been using these very effeedective cough drops for probably 10-15 years-very difficult 2 find in stores-as always-so we order online. After all this time-even thopackaging has changelavor and effectiveness remains the same.What a small pleasure---
1,All-natural statement means nothing,"The ingredients clearly states ""Corn Syrup"" as in Genetically Modified corn syrup. GMOs are not ""All-Natural"" and quite frankly! I'm sick of this term being used to dupe and bamboozle the unaware consumer. If a product states that it is All-Natural, you can just about guarantee it is anything but! Over 90% of corn, including all of its derivatives are genetically modified."
2,Disappointed in this box,Hi. This is the 2nd box of these & I have to tell you that I am disappointed with this box. I had difficulty removing the clear wrapping from the individual pieces...it's almost like the box was exposed to conditions that were too hot! Also many of the drops I've had from this box seemed to have very little honey in them. I fell in love with these drops with the first box...they really help me with some health issues. But I have been unhappy with this box....perhaps it was overlooked in quality control?!! Cindi
5,Great cough drops,"These are my favorite cough drops. They suppress my cough better than any other kind I've used (excepting maybe those nasty, super-strong, fisherman's kind). The menthol+honey combo is perfect and delicious!"
3,additional postage due,"These are excellent cough drops. A friend let me try one and I immediately ordered, however... I had to pick them up at the PO because there was an additional $5.25 postage due. They were worth it, and I picked them up. Being as this was my first time ordering from Amazon (i never shop online) I remembered why I don't shop online."
1,Don't,Keep buying Grisham or Sandford or Connelly; at least they are consistent.Philosophical was not the worst of Kerr ( that was the Berlin Serie) but close to it. The only good story I read fm him is A five year plan.
4,Satisfyingly dark.,"A bit wordy, but worthy, too. I like the futuristic touches, such as replacing the death penalty with reversible ""punitive coma."" It saves space in the prisons, as the convicts are stored in drawers."
4,"Interesting read, bad dialogue","This book has a great many clever ideas, and a tight and engaging narrative which makes it a thought-provoking and entertaining read. The musings of the Wittgenstein character are distrurbing and fascinating in equal measure.However, the dialogue (with the exception of some of the Wittgenstein 'pieces') is awful, and the female inspector's character is given an extremely thin characterization, to the point that she is almost unbelievable.Well worth reading regardless, for its portrayal of the darker, yet sharply logical, side of the human mind, and with some interesting ideas about possible future society."
2,boring and long winded,I assume that Phillip Kerr must have a background in Philosophy which he trying to demonstrate in this book. Bernie Gunther was definitely a break through for him but in this there are pages and pages of uninteresting dialogue. Switching between the thoughts of the investigating detective and the murderer to me is too contrived.
4,Good if not spectacular album from a first-rate session player,"A former member of early 70s sibling group The Five Stairsteps and a prolific session singer, Keni Burke (born Kenneth Burke on 9-28-53 in Chicago), released a largely unnoticed album entitled ""Keni"" in 1980 before establishing more musical assurance with this 1981 release. This is not the album that contains his signature song ""Rising To The Top"", (that is from 1982), but it does contain lots of strong soul crooning against a variety of midtempo backgrounds and the slower, quiet-storm type ones that he has become best known for. Highlights include the sweet ballad ""Never Stop Loving Me"", and the funky, slightly more uptempo ""Love Is The Answer""."
4,"Narrow, lightweight and handy","I like this stylus and think it has distinct advantages over ""fatter"" ones. It is long enough, comfortable to hold and conveniently stores in the ear-bud opening when you aren't using it, which makes it a little bit less likely to get lost. It does skip a bit (which I think is intrinsic to its capacitive nature, but I am not positive) and does not have as tiny a point as I would like (I want smaller than currently exists) but it sure has sped up my texting and also my accuracy. With others, I felt like I was using a mechanical thumb and they decreased my precision, being so wide I couldn't even view the actual point at which they made contact with the screen. I would love to see this made with a longer ""lanyard"" so you could type/text while leaving it attached to the phone and not be bothered with re-attaching it- Sort of like the attachment ribbons for babies pacifiers! Maybe even retractible? LOL Until my fantasy ""perfect stylus"" is made, this will do quite nicely."
1,massive horse pills,these pills have gotten stuck in my throat now so many times I can't even take them. Why would they make something so huge! The pills are hard and have sharp edges to them. It's unthinkably poor design
1,It just doesn't work for me,"I bought this product because of good reviews and I needed a good, high-absorption magnesium supplement. I'm a 24 year old male.I've really been on and off with this supplement, because I haven't had a good experience with it. Today will probably be the last time I take it. I've had really bad abdominal pains since taking it about 2 hours ago. It feels like my abdomen is just inflating and about to burst. Maybe my body isn't used to taking it, but I can't put up with this med to be able to adjust.It might work for other people, but not for me. I like this company, I've bought 1 or 2 other supplements from them. I just can't tolerate this one. If anyone is in my boat and found another supplement that doesn't hurt, please feel free to recommend."
1,magnesium in pill form,I am not able to take magnesium orally - it upsets my stomach. I do fine though without magnesium supplementation.
2,"Giant, difficult-to-swallow pills with very low does","I won't be buying these again. I can't recall ever having difficulty with other pills, but these are enormous. I find choking them down very challenging. And two merely give you half the RDA for magnesium. If you're trying to correct a deficiency, even if the delivery system is slight more efficient (is it?), you're still stuck taking several very dry, giant horse pills each day.I haven't noticed any difference with digestion comparing these with other mid-quality magnesium supplements.I can't wait 'til the bottle is gone -- but that may be a while, since I consistently procrastinate taking it now."
2,not potent,I didn't realize these were only 200mg so I have to take between 4-6 of these huge pills for any effect. My mistake. I will purchase a brand with a higher amount per pill in the future.
4,Great!,"Most multivitamins do not have high levels of magnesium (let alone chelated magnesium, which is easier for your body to absorb.) This product is fairly priced and I would purchase it again!"
3,idk,"is it working, idk, maybe it is, i feel calmer.... i think.... whats it supposed to do again? im confused"
3,Office chair,"Nice chair, but if you are a little on the heavy side the arms could extend a little further. Other than that it's good."
1,Not Impressed At All,"I Bought This Chair Cause It Had Good Reviews. That Is Why I Am Writing This Review.Reasons For A Bad Review:#(1) Smaller Than The Last Computer Chair.#(2) It Has Hard Cushions Not Cosy At All In My Opinion.#(3) This Chair Does Not Go Low Enough For My Wife's Feet To Reach The Floor.#(4) Nor Does It Fit Under The Computer Desk At The Lowest Setting. It Just Sits Too High At Lowest Setting.I Thought That This Chair Would Be A Good Chair Cause It Was More Pricey Than The Last Chair i Bought, And It Had Good Reviews. My Last Chair Was A $50 Walmart Special And Was A Much Nicer Chair.**** NOT Worth The Money In My Opinion Period. ****"
4,Executive office chair,"This chair came well packed and had all the materials I needed, including wrenches and screwdrivers;It goes together in minutes and is very comfortable and perfedt for my use, which is at a computer console.I would highly recommed this item at this price.Lynn"
4,fantastic delivery,"All I can say at this time is, I purchashed it as a xmas present for my husband, The delvery was fantastic, however the box was a little beat up and I hope everything is okay, but I will not be opening until my grandson gets here to put it together. I will then return and finish the review of the product."
3,Bowen leather executive office chair,"The chair is ok. The back is not as high as I thought it was, however, so far the chair is comfortable. The instructions don't indicate you need to take a hammer to slightly tap the wheels in, then you can push. Do not take the little wire around the top of the wheel off, that is what holds the wheel in the slot. The reason I mention this is because an earlier review said the wheels kept coming out. I took the little wire off on one wheel because I thought it was blocking the hole to get in; the wheel fell out. Then I got a hammer, tapped another wheel in, pushed and it snapped in place. It would have taken me 15 minutes to put together, except I had to figure out about the wheels."
4,Well acted four character study,"A young man, somewhat lost, comes from Argentina to Madrid to be with his distanced, emotionally detached filmmaker father. But he ends up spending almost as much time with his dad's sexy, druggie younger mistress, (an incandescent performance by Cecilia Roth) and his dad's hedonistic, bi-sexual actor best friend.Entertaining and moving at times, the central character (the filmmaker-father) is so removed, and so hurtful it becomes hard to understand why the others continue to put up with him. It also gets a bit repetitive, as it becomes obvious that each time the father starts to open up, he'll just close down again. And it can feel very wordy.It reminded me of a pretty good Woody Allen drama. If it had more humor it might have made it even better. Still, I'm glad I saw it, and I find moments and performances stick with me."
2,Not crazy about these,I wanted chip clips and these seemed like a good deal and looked nice. I should have just bought traditional chip clips. These don't stay on well unless I role the bags up really nice and tight.
3,Bag Sealer,My hand has screws to hold it together & some of these work good & others are almost impossible to slide in!
1,Not as expected!,"Thought these bag clips would be like ones bought years ago. Unfortunately, these are really too tight to be useful for any of the chip bags that I purchase. Too often in attempting to use these clips, the bag is torn in the process -- defeating the whole purpose for utilizing them."
5,Favorite clips,"It didn't take long (maybe 20 minutes) for the newly arrived Clip-n-Seals to become our favorite bag clips. The medium size fits our needs best, but the small ones get plenty of use, too. The large ones are VERY large, but a reviewer for them suggested trimming them down to a more convenient length, and that is a really good idea."
5,Fantastic Product!,"My husband bought a variety pack of these a few years ago and they are""totally awesome"" as my kids would say. They provide a great seal that is much better than your run of the mill ""chip clip"". Crackers, cereals and snacks seem to stay fresh indefinately (no kidding!). Even products that seem to get stale easily (like Goldfish or Veggie Bootie) stay fresh a really long time. The product is inexpensive and extremely durable -- I doubt they will ever need to be replaced. The small size is especially useful as they are short enough to fit inside a cereal box or cracker box. We fold the inside bag toward the middle so the clip will fit on and then shove the whole thing back in the box. No more stale cereal! We've given this product as gifts to people. Highly recommended!"
2,Not great for use to seal liquids,"I was excited to try these based on the reviews. I sure was disappointed. I bought these to seal liquids in a bag because they claim to have an ""Air- and watertight seal keeps food fresh"". Any pressure on the bag and the liquid comes out. If they were truly watertight, this wouldn't happen. I am giving these a 2 star because if I can apply slight pressure to the bag and water comes out, it is neither air nor water tight and I don't like to say I hate things. I wish I would have tested the liquid seal before trimming some of them down to the size I needed. If I had done so, these would be going back.To summarize, if you need these for sealing in liquids, you might want to look elsewhere."
1,If you LOVE John Coltrane,This a very bad sound & picture copy of the Jazz Casual performance of the John Coltrane Quartet.
5,nice stand,"very nice product from Park Tool...I would expect no lessstrong, sturdy and easy to use, I would recommend this product to any home mechanic."
2,Defective,The screw to adjust the clamp would not tighten enough to keep the clamp in place. The screw broke though the plastic piece so now I have to go to a hardware store and find a longer bolt and washer to fix it.
5,Well-made bike repair clamp,"I bought this bike repair clamp to use in my Rockwell JawHorse, and it works very well. I mounted it to a T-shaped wooden fixture that I can then clamp in the JawHorse to provide a stable stand. The clamp is well-made with heavy-duty components, and I believe that over time it will prove to be more durable than anything I could have built with PVC pipe."
5,Good Clamp,"I also ordered Park's more expensive clampPark Tool Bench Mount Repair Standat the same time (Amazon shipped too fast to cancel only minutes later), so I had the opportunity to compare side by side. This is the better product. I give it five stars. Initially concerned from reading other reviews that the elbow is plastic, but it really is a very heavy fiber reinforced piece - no concerns any more. The part that clamps the bike works great and clamps with a very smooth-working screw motion that allows for complete control over the clamping force. - The one improvement I would suggest is an adjustable length base that could position the bike higher so you don't have bend-over while working. I welded a 2x2 metal post to the provided base to get more height and also so it could mount in my Jawhorse vice-workbench (see picture I posted)."
4,Mounting hole alignment?,The bench mounted repair stand is very well made except that one of the four mounting holes is aligned differently. Perhaps this is so you can bolt it to the bench in the dark but it is no big deal. Typical Park Tool quality.
3,Back To The Divide,"Back To The Divide is a good book to read. It's about a boy named Felix and his friends Betony and Ironclaw. All Three of them have to stop a japegrin named Snakeweed from making his way into Felix's dimension before he can shoe the humans magic.I think this would be a great book for kids with an imagination. The book has creature like a tangle-person, a brazzle or griffen, brittlehorn or a unicorn and a japegrin or pixie."
1,Christie is a shallow narcissist,"After viewing this video, it seems clear that Christie Brinkley is a self-centerd, shallow, narcissist. No wonder she burned through four poor husbands."
3,Book and Video combined- NOT a good idea,"You have all read this story, am I right? You have shared this story with your child, am I right? You walk into the store and say, ""Hey they actually made a video out of that,"" Before you put it in your cart, let me give you a breif warning of what is to come. Your experience will change forever. IT changed mine. Orginally you would think that the dog on the cover is sweet and calmly told the bird, ""I am not your mother, I am a dog,"" this video changes this scenario. The dog has a ruff, gruff, mean voice and will scare your child. The ""SNOOORRRT"" is now a lot more disturbing then it was when you read it. Your kids will laugh no more. This video sucks all the enjoyment out of the book and makes a mockerey of it. Along with ""Go Dog Go"" and ""The Best Nest"" this video will ruin some of the three best child books ever created. I advise you now. Buy the book. NO VIDEO! Got it?"
5,"Iktomi the trickster, again on a hilarious misadventure.","The trickster of the Lakota, IKTOMI is once again teaching young readers (and Old) a moral story without the sermon. The seventh book of the Iktomi series, this one is a masterpiece of visual illustrations that we have come to expect of Paul Goble's work. Iktomi runs afoul of a scoundrel that swindles Iktomi in a land deal swap for a worthless game/trick. Iktomi quickly breaks the rules of the game, of course, and loses his eyes. The trickster then manages to persuade the mouse and buffalo to donate an eye apiece to Iktomi. Therein ensues some hilarious escapades that will delight the young reader and bring a smile to the adult. My two clildren were laughing so hard at Iktomi's self-inflicted predicaments. The beautiful artwork, and clever tale makes a superb story that will be long remembered; as all Iktomi tales are meant to be... Highly recommended for ages 3 - 10, and of course adults of any age. A must have for the library storyteller."
1,Flimsy piece of junk,"Wish it was possible to rate this thing negative starts. It was broken within twenty minutes, just a flimsy piece of junk. At least we were able to get our money back. Don't waste yours--avoid this thing like the plague."
2,"Unanimously, a mediocre book","See the Images I added above to get a glimpse inside the book. Not very inspired projects. Only 19 of the pictured items are charted and these are some of the most simple and uninteresting. The pieces are almost all dwarfed by the rooms they're in but this fails as an artistic book. For me, the best designs are those in the Images but I will not make them."
2,SAME OLD TALE...,"It's the same old tale: an accomplished band, with no reason at all, record a CD totally different from their previous (and sucessful)albuns. Because it is bad (not because it's different: it's just bad) the majority of fans don't buy the albun, or get furious with their idols. Then the band, refusing to accept the fact that they made a mistake, start saying thing like this: 1) ""This is our best albun till date...""; 2) ""We are improving our music..""; 3) ""We don't care about our fans' opinions. We make music for ourselves and, if other people like it, much better""; 4)""We're searching for new frontiers and a new kind of public..."";It's sad to say, but this CD is not Megadeth. Only ""Breadline"" is a great tune."
3,What was Megadeth thinking?,"This latest release from Megadeth is okay, but it totally and completely pales in comparison to their previous works like ""Rust In Peace"", ""Countdown To Extinction"", ""Youthanasia"", and even ""Cryptic Writings"". I hope this is not how they are going to write future albums, or I won't buy their albums anymore!"
1,One of THEE worst rock CDs I've ever heard.,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Megadeth fan. But this CD just doesn't cut it with all its soft slow tunes."
1,OOPS I MEANT TO PUT DOWN ONE STAR NOT FIVE!,IT'S LIKE I SAID BEFORE THIS ALBUM IS TERRIBLE!I HOPE DAVE AND THE OTHERS WAKE UP AND MAKE A BETTER ALBUM NEXT TIME!I LOVE BECKY BANE FOR LIFE!
1,As good as Van Halen 3,"Well, what a suprise. I guess this is the latest trend. To completely suck. I pretty much only listen to Megadeth's first 3 albums anyway. I guess Dave's trying to be a guest VJ on MTV or something. Yes, if the Backstreet Boys made a heavy metal album, it would sound like Risk. If you haven't heard this cd yet, take 15 dollars out of your wallet and throw it away because it's the same thing. It is a Risk to buy this cd."
3,"Interesting, but a little too pop for me","This is a pretty good album and is a decent try to depart from the continuous heavy metal sound that they are used to, but it left me wanting more metal and less pop. I think that Metallica made a much better effort on their Load and Reload albums, but it just didn't work for Megadeth, not on this record anyway."
2,2.5 Stars acctually.,"Megadeth produces another album with good music here. The Major problem is not their effort. The songs are all quite listenabble and some of them are pretty good. The main problem here is not the quallity, it's the performance. First of all the material is very varried. The first song is kind off heavy and pretty good. Prince of darkness is cool. It's a new kind of vibe that combines cello with heavy guitars. But the first two songs are the only ones that sound like megadeth. The rest of the album, (allmost) is some pop-rock hybrid without cool solos, angry vocals, doubble drums, cool arangements or frenetic riffing. Well it's worth buying but something of a let down for true fans."
3,Sweet Jesus..........,"""Cryptic Writings"" should have been enough warning for me, but believe it or not, ""Risk"" is not a total loss (not by much anyway). The best songs are Insomnia, Price of Darkness, I'll Be There, and The Doctor is Calling, all the rest are pretty forgetable. New drummer Jimmy DeGrasso fits in nicely, and believe it or not he is somewhat better than Nick Menza, Mustaine seems to sound better with each new album, and as always the guitars are great. Sadly though, this was Marty Friedman's last album with Megadeth, he left a little while after ""Risk"" went Gold, to be replaced by Al Pitrelli. If your a true Megadeth fan, pick up their new album ""The World Needs a Hero"" if you want to hear classic Megadeth, but if your a Megadeth nut, you might as well pick this up too."
3,"Shaky, but not a total dissapointment","This album gets no respect. Really, I think there is some truly great writing and playing on here. Just because every album does not sound exactaly the same doesn't mean the band has sold out. Luckily, unlike Metallica, Megadeth realized that this type of music disgusted their longtime fans and failed to reach the audiance they were aiming for, and has returned with a new, true-to-form album, with Al Pitrelli replacing Marty Friedman, who was the main cause of this album sounding the way it does, anyway.As Dave Mustaine said, this album may have been a commercial failure, but it wasn't an artistic failure. Just give it a chance."
4,"Uhhhh, ok.","After two years of listening to this, I think I can honestly make a fair review. First off, other peoples' opinions never have anything to do with the way I view a product. Risk certainly is strange and is a bit cluttered at times but it really does pack a huge punch!! I first heard Breadline on the radio and I thought, ""what is this, pop-ified Alice Cooper?"", but then I got into the groove and decided to buy the CD. At first I was extremely disappointed, but I forced myself to listen more carefully because I don't like to waste money! Insomnia is blistering and very unique, and I give it props for that but it's a little messy. Prince Of Darkness has a mean riff, and Crush Em' is actually one of my favorite Megadeth Songs. I recommend this album because for the band, it was surely a ""Risk"", and I think it worked. I am also glad the band is steering more toward its roots with The World Needs A Hero though."
1,"so far, so good, now what??????","what happened here? megadeth transforming in some kind of metallica?????, sad but true, and so the history repeats itself, Mustain ex-god has lost talent and consequently fans. I have listen to bands that also transform their style of music,(like theatre of tragedy, tiamat, control denied, my dying bride), but this bands make for a great change with great compositions, i know mustain can do it, but i believe, he needs to concentrate, take your time Dave no one is rushing you."
5,"Enchanted CD, enchanted music THE BEST MUSIC","This album made me like megadeth the best. At first I was kinda dissapointed, but the more I hear it, the more I like it. How could anybody dislike this album. It`s THE BEST. My favorite songs are : Insomnia, Prince of Darkness, Enter the Arena, Crush èm, Breadline, The Doctor`s calling, I`ll Be There, Wanderlust, Ecstacy, Seven, Time: The Beginning, and Time : The End. In other words all of them.My advise to guy guys and girls: Buy this record!"
4,Not Heavy But Still Worth a Listen,"If you are looking for the old, heavy Megadeth, this isn't it. But if you are into music that is just good no matter what catagory it falls under, you should listen to this CD. Granted there are a couple of songs that fall short and sound very Bon Jovi-ish (which is fine if you happen to BE Bon Jovi) but songs like ""Insomnia"" and ""Prince of Darkness"" are great and show a band willing to branch out stylistically. After a few listenings, this CD really can grow on you."
4,RISK rocks,"I just love this cd! It is not very heavy but it is still good. My favorite songs are ""crush'em"",""The doctor is calling"" and ""Time:The end"". And it is funny that Megadeth have put an interview on the cd that you can watch on your computer."
1,Very Disappointing,"I knew this album was going to be a let down, I could tell by all the interviews Mustaine was doing and all the so-called influences he claimed to be implementing into this record!Well it's no surprise this was a let down, but I didn't think the whole album would be a complete disaster as it turned out to be. As a die-hard Megadeth fan I can honestly say this has no place in anyone's collection. I bought it just to support one of my favourite bands, but it doesn't even deserve that!Beware, this album is mediocre to the limit! Nothing new, nothing exciting, exhilarating...just plain boring!"
2,MEGADENCE !!,Great pop songs. Bad heavy metal. This allbum is Megadeth's Youthanasia. I hope they earn money with this.
4,Good Rock,Before buying this album I was never into Megadeth. After hearing Risk and loving it I tried to listen to some of their older stuff. Yes it is alot diffrent as many people say it is. I like the older stuff better but Risk is still good. I liked even more considering I had nothing to compare it too. If you have never heard Megadeth and you like Rock this is the cd for you.
1,THIS IS NOT MEGADETH!,"Well what happend to megadeth. The same thing that happened to metallica. They went down the toilet! .This is not metal!. If you want metal, listen to any other megadeth album. The name does imply the right thought though, you would be taking a RISK buying this album, so don't!"
5,Megadeth can never do wrong,I'm a big Megadeth fan and they are in top form in this record. Even though its not like there old days but they make some great music. i recomend this to all fans.
2,"Good music, just ain't Megadeth though.","Anyway, the stuff on 'Risk' is OK at best. It has good songs like ""Insomnia"", ""Crush 'Em"", ""Prince Of Darkness"", and a great one like ""Time Prts.1&2"". I still don't know what they were thinking with ""I'll Be There"" and ""Estascy"". This stuff just isn't Megadeth. Yeah, I am a huge fan of Industrial music, however I just doesn't fit with Megadeth. Don't get me wrong, I have the utmost respect for a band's desire to go on do what they wish. I just don't care too much for the stuff on ""Risk"". I hope Megadeth will release more Thrash-Metal we all love them for in the near future. Like I said, I love Industrial music. But imagine an Industrial band turning into a Thrash band(Ministry, for example). What would the Industrial fans think?"
2,"OK Record, but not a Megadeth record.","While the CD has some OK songs, it does not sound like a Megadeth record. It does not even sound like a HEAVY record. Buy the CD, record it, and then compare to the previous CD's when Megadeth was a REAL risk to listen to."
4,Great to see another band not get stuck in a rut,"I really enjoy this cd. I get so sick of the same sound from a band with different artwork each time. Glad to see they're exploring their talents instead of seeing how fast they can play. Once again, everyone follows metallica. ;)"
4,"A very anticipated follow up to ""Cryptic Writing's""!!","Not bad, not as heavy as most Megadeth fans would have expected though. It is farely creative and experimental but it does lack power. There is a disappointing trace of techno in it. However some of the songs are catchy and grow on you. If you are a true Megadeth fan you should add this to your collection!!!"
2,disappointed,"i am the biggest megadeth fan ever....when cw came out i was sooooo excited,my husband and i followed them all over the states on thier cw tour and were soooo excited about the new album we tried to get the lady at the music store to sell us the cd on the 30th of august,of coarse she wouldn't. i am disappointed! ihate admitting that,cause i really want to like it! i have found my self liking it more and more with each time i listen to it,but my first reaction was total disappointment! nothing like my first reation with cw or countdowwn or youthanasia or rust,etc.hoping it will ""grow"" on me!"
3,Could be better for Megadeth,"I WAS WAITING FOR THIS ALBUM FOR A WHILE BUT IWAS A LITTLE BIT DISSAPOINTED. THE ALBUM HAS MORE BALLADS THAN HEAVY SONGS. THE ONLY GOOD SONGS ON THE ALBUM ARE ""CRUSH EM, AND THE DOCTOR IS CALLING. BUY ONLY IF YOU REALLY LIKE MEGADETH."
2,"What happened, Megadeth?","What happened to the days when I could throw on Rust in Peace, Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia (all of which sound different from each other but still really killer)? I could listen to the entire CD all the way through and love every minute of it (even the French junk like Et Tout Le Monde). If this new CD didn't have the Megadeth name on it, I wouldn't have even bought it, let alone listen to it 3 times just to give them a chance. I hate it! The only real standouts are Breadline, I'll Be There and Wanderlust. However, Journey could have put this CD out ten years ago and it would sound the same. Oh yeah, and the ever-laughable Crush 'Em; soon to be the new WCW anthem. Please Dave, give us some HEAVY next time. Meanwhile... I am going to go put on my old Rammstein CD. I may not be able to understand anything, but it sure sounds cool!"
4,Megadeth never ceases to amaze my ears.,"Overall, a great recording. Just as with Cryptic Writings, it took me one listening to get used to it. Some of the best and truly original material they've ever done. But the songs with Bud Prager in the credits tend to be the ones I don't like as much as the ones written solely by Dave. Keep it up MEGADETH! I look forward to your next recording. And to comment on the Katherine's review, she should not even be working at Amazon if she cannot do her homework on the bands she is reviewing. CRUSH HER!"
4,Solid piece of work again for MD,"As usual, the melodic talent of Mustaine and Freidman makes itself quite apparent. Having just bought the CD, it's very early, but I'm not sure this ranks compared to Cryptic Writings, but it's awfully good and a must for any MD fan. These guys continue to prove their musical depth and also continue to prove that there is no way to categorize their music or what they represent."
1,PARENT FRIENDLY!,"This first release from megadeth since 1997 is very parent friendly. i am a life long fan of the band and i can honestly say this is the worst cd from the band ever. its ""RADIO READY"". i really cant believe dave put this one out. sorry guys 1 star from a life long fan. it lacks the ram it down your throat non sell out edge the band has had since their first release."
2,Disappointed!!,"This album pales in comparison to thier earlier days, Rust in Peace and Peace Sells...prime examples. Megadeth has gone the way of the dollar and sold out big time with thier ""new"" hardly metal sound and more to the simplistic alternative route. There is only one left in the four horseman of the apacalypse that hasn't sold out, and that's Slayer. Megadeth fans, skip this one."
2,Weak!,Its very weak compared to anything they have put out in the past. It just doesn't pack the punch(whose album does these days...) It doesnt have bite I expected from a Megadeth album. I am still listening to it trying to like some of the songs but like LOAD and RE-LOAD I can see I'm gonna get bored with this album quick!!!
2,Was a disapointment,"This album was a disapointment in my eyes. I am not an individual that doesn't like it when a group changes its style or its musical taste. Hell I liked Warrant when it changed as well as several other groups. This album beyond a couple of good songs was not very good at all. I have to say that this album all together is medicore and isn't very good. I felt that Cryptic Writings was a good album and that this one is very sub-par. The buyer bewear of this CD, I have read about people buying this album and liking it, I am one of those that didn't. If you like Megadeth at all for its old sound, than this isn't the album for you, this album isn't musically very good and is lacking period."
1,Shocked!!!,"This isn't Megadeth!!! This album is the worse supposed-to-be-metal album!!! Dave, stop going Metallica's way!! Be yourself! This album doesn't deserve the 1 star. It deserves a big 0."
5,Gave us something different,"I love Megadeth, I truly am a fan. I love metal, and Metallica, and am a hardcore fan. I own both load and reload of Metallica's, and I listen to them. And I agree, change up things every now and then, it's good. Tried and true bands like these two can't go wrong. Megadeth, with Risk, it's honestly kinda like the transition from Metallica's Black Album to LOAD....RISK really is a great album, but my faith is in the next album."
4,Risk,"This CD shows that Megadeth is more than a trash/speed metal band for sure. While some songs like insomnia and crush em should have been left out of this CD other songs like Wanderlust and Breadline are classics and could be compared to songs on metallicas black album. All in all if you get this CD you will get 6 superb tracks (Prince of Darkness, Breadline, I'll be there, Wanderlust, Ecstacy, Time: The Beginning) out of 12 and thats reason enough to buy it"
3,Great first half,"The album starts out great with songs like ""Insomnia"" and ""Crush 'em,"" but goes downhill after that. The songs are just too soft on the second half. I think the band forgot who their core audience is."
3,It has its moments but not good enough,"This cd is a real RISK taken by Megadeth, risk they shouln't have taken. The cd is good, if you take out Megadeth's name in front of it and maybe put Metallica or any other band well ok. But this is not Megadeth, Megadeth should just stick to its fast, thrash-metal roots. Anyway, songs 1-5 and Exctasy are the best, the rest well... they're listenable."
3,Ever-improving songwriting,"My previous two Megadeth purchases were _Countdown to Extinction_ and _Youthanasia_, so I was simply shocked by the lack of punch in this CD. It's taken me a little time to warm up to this one. What has allowed me to warm up to it is the ever-improving songwriting. Megadeth's lyrics get better every album (overall, that is -- ""Prince of Darkness"" and ""Crush 'Em"" are lyrical duds). And regardless of whether Megadeth is playing it heavy or not, they sure know how to put together a memorable tune. They continue to play with precision and verve, the two qualities that drew me to them in the first place."
3,A small drop from Cryptic,"Risk is a pretty consistent CD...all songs are good in quality, but as far as something jumping out at you and making you say ""wow that's cool"" or ""wow what a great lick"" didn't happen for me. I have been a huge Megadeth fan for years now, and I've basically loved everything they've done until. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad cd, some may like it....but I never realized what a big part of the band drummer Nick Menza was until he wasn't there anymore. Well you can certainly notice a difference in the drummer. Degrasso isn't really aggressive at all on the set as was Menza. So it kinda gives Risk a watered down kind of feeling. I'm definitely not denouncing Megadeth! They are a wonderful band (as you all probably know or you wouldn't be reading this right now). I still support them, but maybe next CD will bring about a new drummer. hopefully."
1,WTF?,"This is the biggest disapointment since MD.45!! Risk went way off, It has simularities to Cryptic Writtings but it isn't heavy enough. It doesn't even sound like Megadeth any more. Dave should have stuck to his roots!!"
1,Terrible Effert by Megadeth!,weak album!No wonder it's called Risk!I took the risk of buying it and i didn't like it at all!I messed up last time on my review and gave it 5 stars!I mean't to give it 1 star!If you want real metal try slayer or pantera!
3,It Really Isn't So Bad,"For those of you who gave this record low ratings, I understand your disappointment. Granted, this is not Megadeth's best record or even 2nd best. But, there is value to be found in it. Now, don't get me wrong. I WANT to hear more songs like 'Good Mourning Black Friday,' 'The Conjuring,' 'Set the World Afire,' 'Hangar 18,' and 'The Tornado of Souls.' But remember, Dave Mustaine is an artist. Ofcourse he is going to try some different things now and then. In all honesty, this record has some memorable tracks like 'Insomnia,' 'Wonderlust,' and 'Time.' If you only want the essential Megadeth, I suggest you stick with 'Peace Sells, But Who's Buying?,' 'Rust In Peace,' and 'The World Needs A Hero.' But if you are open to hearing the different sides of Dave Mustaine, then ""Risk"" should be in your collection. Keep in mind, Dave Mustaine DID NOT sell out. His latest record ""The World Needs A Hero"" shows that he still cares about what us heavy metal fans want."
1,Risk is now the worst album ever made!,"--1 out of 5! Just when you thought Megadeth couldn't degenerate more than they already did on Cryptic Writings, Risk is now the nadir of their career. Cryptic Writings was the worst album ever made, but now it has a twin. It's difficult to discern which is worse, but after listening to both in agony and sadness, I would have to say that Risk has now taken Craptic Writings dumpster. It's difficult to imagine a band like Megadeth, with 6 of the most dominant albums ever made(killing through youth), to degenerate to this kind of position. Anyway, if you are thinking of buying this record, do yourself a favor and don't. If you are a hardcore fan of Megadeth's first 6 albums, and you hated Cryptic Writings, as you should have, then you will also be disgusted with Risk. To all the old hardcore fans, stay true to Megadeth, and destroy Megacrap."
1,Weak,"I will admit I don't have the remaster of this album where Dave supposedly has removed all the little Bud Prager sound effects. I am here to tell you that it doesn't matter if you remove the crap stain from crap, it is still going to be just crap. In other words this album was horrible and nothing can change that. I find no redeeming factors to this, not one song that I can pick out and say ""well at least there this one song"". It doesn't even really make a good pop rock album, which is what he was going after. This one can be likened to Load and Reload for all of you that love making the Metallica connection to all the Megadeth albums, only this goes much lower then those ever could. He always did out do them when it came to thrash metal, I guess he wanted to prove he could suck even worse then them too, Dave is just that kind of guy."
4,Intense!!!!!!!,"Plan and simple, RISK-ROCKS. Its Megadeth, alot better than there last attempt at ""Deth"" metal. I would of gave it 5 stars, but I gave that to Godsmack. PEACE!!!!"
1,"""RISK"" buying it!",Bought it at 12:30 pm before going to work. 1:15 pm I flung it out the window like a booger doing 75 mph on I290 to Chicago.
1,Horrible,My ... i never knew megadeth could come out with <stuff> like this. I was anxious for a new megadeth album and when RISK came out i was so happy. I bought it and cranked it up and the first song Insomnia ... i was thinking what in the world is this. It sure doesnt sound like megadeth. Then Crush was on i couldnt stand it. I am use to there speed metal sound not this kind of music. Beware Megadeth fans you would be better off with the older stuff Countdown to Extinction is worth listening too. What a dissapointment. This album really doesnt deserve 1 star. The guitar work on this album is so mellow. ....
4,Very good,"I don't see why some people hate this album so much. True, some of their older music is better, but this is a very good album. ""Crush 'Em"" is the best song on this album, and it is one of their best songs ever. Some other good songs on this album are ""Time: The End,"" ""The Doctor Is Calling,"" ""Insomnia,"" & ""Prince Of Darkness."""
5,"Yep, gotta admit I luv it!","Honestly, after the first listening I was a bit dissapointed. I thought for myself that Megadeth did the same mistake as Metallica but they didn't! I gave the CD another try and well... then came the third ""try"", 4th ""try"" and now I've listened to it for about 3 weeks. Risk is one of MD's best albums, ""I'll be there"" one of their best songs. I just wanna thank Dave, David, Marty and Jimmy for giving us hardcore Megadeth fans another great album. You gotta give them credit for not doing the same thing in every CD. MD isn't afraid to try new elements in their music. They just keep getting better. TE TULETTE OLEMAAN IKUISESTI SE AINUT OIKEA, KIITOS!!"
1,disapointment......,"I've been a megadeth fan since forever....have always loved their music and the different directions they've taken it to. But to be honest theres plenty of other pop bands out there that can make better music than what megadeth is trying to offer us now. Sorry, Dave, you told me to honest! Lee"
5,This album ROCKS,"I don't know why everyone is so down on RISK. Just because it isn't pure thrash like ""Peace Sells "" or ""Countdown"" doesn't mean it isn't a good album. I'm not always in the mood for thrash..sometimes I just want something different. My fav. tracks on this are of course ""Crush Em"" ""Prince of Darkness"" & ""Insomina"". The guitar work on Prince of Darkness is great! It really ROCKS! I would recommend this album to any Megadeth fan. I would like to tell Dave & the boys ""Keep up the good work guys"""
1,What the hell???,"Amazon needs to have a ""No stars"" entry. This album never should have been released."
2,Hope the Megadeth Fate has not been sealed,"I became a fan after the So Far So Good album, became even more of a fan after Rust In Peace. I remember waiting in line at midnight to get countdown to extinction. When I first put countdown in my car I remember how different it sounded, but it ended kind of growing on me, but I still hoped this was not a permanent change, as long as they didn't turn glam! But it seems every album they get closer to the ""G"" word! I hope the fate is not sealed. I still am a fan of megadeth, but I find that Rust in Peace is already in my CD player more than Risk ( and Ive only had Risk 2 days!) Some of the songs are OK. I didnt really like Cryptic Writings that much and even that one kicks risk's ***! Anyways, be careful and listen before you buy."
1,DONT LET ME CATCH ON THE STREET MUSTAINE,So when will metillacrap and megaturd get with the new mtv sellout trend and put out rap-metal garbage like limp biskit or korn?
1,metalhead,what a pile of crap!! can't stand nothing on this megadeth release. I've always and will be a megadeth fan but what is the deal with this release?
4,I Heard the Voice of Redemption,"This is Megadeth's most well-produced album in my opinion. It doesn't rock necessarily, but the tunes are solid and the ideas and production rules - making it a very listenable album. This also has a very important song on it, ""I'll Be There"" which is basically Mustaine's wake up call from God. I also like ""Insomnia"" and its maniacal ""I keep waking up!!"" If you like Mustaine, then you'll like this, because it is definitely Dave."
3,I wrote this album off too fast...,"I remember when I first listened to this CD and after listening to it once...threw it on my shelf and never listened to it again. I was really dissapointed with this CD and for the longest time dismissed it as not part of Megadeth's collection. Well, flash a few years later and after listening to the newest greatest hits and I heard Prince of Darkness and I didn't remember it. I looked for what album it was off of and sure enough it was ""Risk"". This was the point that I dusted off the CD and put it on once again and was suprised with it. It is Megadeth's weakest album for sure but there are a few good songs on here. Those songs would be...Prince of Darkness, Insomnia, Doctor is Calling, Time : The End, and Seven. The rest of the album is rather questionable to me."
2,Risk Management,"yeahyou ever use mouthwash in the morning and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. that pretty much sums up this album. you know, it's always difficult for me to blast an album, cause, i'll never be an excellent musician as anybody in megadeth, but this album is terrible. I would recommend any megadeth album, but not this one. and what the hell is up with the lame cover?"
3,"They took a ""Risk"" that didn't appeal","I like this album, but I can see why people don't like it. But what I DON'T understand is this whole ""sell out"" excuse to hate the album. Dave and the rest of Megadeth are very gifted and accomplished musicians. They probably got bored writing and playing the same type of stuff, so they took a risk and made ""risk."" Some people liked it, some didn't. But they didn't sell out. Selling out is when you have one good hit and make an entire album of a good hit the next time (e.g. Sugar Ray). Megadeth just wanted to give something else a go, and it wasn't easy to write this stuff, so at least give them credit for that. These guys are in their mid-30's. They can't headbang forever. And they aren't gonna sell more albums writing this kind of music, and I'm sure they knew that. They just did wrote what they wanted to, and its a shame that the fans didn't respect that."
2,Megadeth's worse...,"This sure was a big letdown. To listen to this CD than listen to Rust in Peace and say the same band did the albums is impossible, at least to me. I sure was glad they got their acts together and released 2 HUGE step-ups from this album. I give it 2 stars because it is still Megadeth, and ""Prince of Darkness"" and ""Crush 'Em"" are good songs. Only buy this if...-You're a completist, like me.-You're a die-hard fan that needs all their albums.Well, I have nothing else to say, so I will finish up by saying this:THANK YOU FOR READING."
4,What's The Big Deal?,"I don't understand why so many people bash this album it is really top quality. Sure it is different than all of the others, but that is what makes it great. Megadeth took a different musical direction with this one and I think they greatly succeeded. The songs are more lyrically mature, so is the subject matter, and the music is more artistic. I have been a Megadeth fan for many, many years and I still feel that this is a classic Megadeth album. songs like Wanderlust, I'll Be There and Breadline are just awesome Megadeth classics. so when it comes down to it, this is just a great rock album all Megadeth fans should own."
2,InSOM-ni-OM-ni-OM-ni-ugh,"The day I popped this album into my cd player, a part of me died. Specifically, the part of me that respected Dave Mustaine. Mind you, this album is technically solid, but this can also be said of whoever provides musical backup for the Backstreet Boys. I think Dave must have been attacked by a rabid ground squirrel while visiting the Phoenix zoo soon after ""Cryptic Writings"" was completed. 'Risk' indeed. I urge the prospective buyer to listen to a few tracks before doing anything rash."
1,you have got to be kidding,"So THIS is how Megadeth says ""thank you"" to their fans? They took a big Risk with this one. I think they're on a countdown to extinction."
3,Megadeth: The Decay Of Western Civilization The Metal Years,"The decline of Megadeth can be measured from the point of perfection that was Extinction and followed down from there. After the commercial success of Cryptic Writings, 1999's Risk proved to be just the opposite of the title's suggestion. Not risky at all, in fact this Megadeth disc was predictable and a little too formulaic. The band is starting to get tired of each other and it shows in this album. Spots of brilliance include Breadline and Prince Of Darkness. Everyone talks about the sports anthem, Crush 'Em but I can't stand it at all. Wanderlust is decent. Overall too many forgettable songs to maintain any strength. Say goodbye to Marty Firedman here and now.Dig it!"
5,Great Overlooked CD!,Many people discount this cd without really listening to it well and giving it a chance. Great production and some really nice song writing make this cd a great one to have in your collection!
5,The STORY about this album and why it was made!!!!!!!,The reason why it was called risk and is very different musically from they're other albums is because Lars Ulrich (drummer of Metallica) made a statement in a interview saying Megadeth should take more musical risks. And Dave Mustaine (Lead guitarist/vocals and main song writer) heard about this interview or read it. So he took his advise or did it for spite. Because Dave has always been angry for metallica dumping him from his lead guitarist spot in the band before they made their first record.Well now since I gave you this story about this album and some other info its time I tell you wether the album is good or not. Its good and one of my favorite albums. He proved to Lars that they can do anything. I love this album go buy it.
2,Record Company Pressure Leads to Worst Megadeth Album,"God - No wonder Marty Friedman left the band after this album. A Megadeth album without crunching riffs and flashy guitar solos just isn't right.I saw the band play at Rock City, Nottingham, UK, the other night (excellent two hour show by the way!) and they didn't play a single song off this album - I think that says it all really.."
2,SIMPLE TRUTH,"I don't despise this album nor have any contempt and prejudices against it. But the plain fact is that the album is bad. I'm not saying it is commercial or whatever. THe songs are just plain annoying, boring. tHEY LACK quality, that's all. It's clear Megadeth tried something noble, be it: experiment new grounds ( be it for self reasons or by record company pressures ). But the result backfired totally..."
1,country metal,This is radio friendly country metal that Mustaine co-wrote with some Manager called Bud - Sad but True.
2,complete let down!,"I am a big fan of megadeth. I love all their albums. Risk, well the first thing that came to my mind was is this matchbox 20. Dawn!. Evolving is one thing, but playing bland rock is another. I only hope the new megadeth albums moves in a better direction than this"
1,Not good at all,This isn't Meagdeth. How could they go from metal to Goo Goo Dolls in one album. They should bring back that classic Peace Sells sound. This one was a disappointment. I don't have this CD but I saw videos from it and they just didn't sound like Megadeth. I would not recommend this album.
2,I Didn't Think Megadeth was Capeable of Such A Bad Album,"When te release date for Risk was announced I honestly couldn't wait to get to the store and buy it. I made sure to get to a local record store that was having a 12:01 sale of the album and I bought it. Let me tell you something, I was better off sleeping. It's not the fact that Megadeth changed their sound cause that's not what I'm all about, I welcome change in bands that I like. It's just that the songs on Risk are horrible. Out of the whole album I only like 4 songs. I like Insomnia, Crush Em', Breadline, and Time:The End. I was totally in shock when I listened to this album because I didn't think that Megadeth was capable of creating an album that was this bad. Besides the 4 songs that I like the saving factor of this album is the enhanced portion of it. That made me give the album a 2 insted of a 1. It's pretty cool there is interviews with them in the studio. To be totally honest I really wouldn't reccommend this album to anyone."
2,"They did take a ""Risk""!","The only reason I gave this album any stars is I respect them trying something new. Other than that it sucks (breadline isn't totally bad though). ""Crush Em'"" and ""Enter The Arena"" sound like names for a Twisted Sister song. If you wanna listen to something cool, go buy ""Peace Sells"" or ""Rust In Peace"". I hate to say anything bad about them, but you have to be honest.This CD sounds like Nelson trying to go metal."
2,What a waste.... RISK was enough for Marty Friedman...,"What a stupid album... From the anooying and irritating opening track INSOMNIA, you know there's something terribly wrong here.There are no solos, no memorable songs, just fillers and throwaways!! Amazing how Dave could do that!! No wonder Friedman left the boat soon after that... or was Friedman the responsible for this change of direction and, when Mustaine announced to the badn a returno to origins, Friedman called it quits? I do not know...RISK is horrible, real, real bad. Just it. You wanna experiment different styles and approaches to your music, fine. You wanna just write bad songs, wrong!"
2,"Good One, Dave","Boy, you really had us going there for a couple of years Dave. And here we thought you'd lost all creativity and edge along with your addictions. Fortunately, in 2001, you got us. Anyone who called you a sellout ate their words with a piece of your mind on the side. This album was a pretty good joke, Dave."
2,Don't waste your money,"Some people say that change is good and Megadeth dudes are on the right track. To those people, how would you react if Back Street Boys suddenly changed their music style and started playing death metal? Do you think that would be accepted by their fans? To make this short, there are two or three good songs on this CD but the rest is crap. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,BOTTOM LINE,"Abybody who gave this cd 2 or more stars is not a real music fan, let alone a real megadeth fan. And those of you who gave it 1 star, i'm with you..there should be an option for negative stars..."
1,"I'd rather listen to ""American Idiot"" by Green Day!","I still remember the day I bought a copy of Risk. I actually bought it the same day it was released, and let me tell you, this album is TERRIBLE! Not even one good song on the entire disc. I remember playing the cd over and over, looking veinly for those heavy riffs and flashy guitar solos that Megadeth were famous for. Sad to say, I found nothing! Nothing but radio ready corporate rock bull$hit. Half of these songs wouldn't sound out of place on a ""Light Rock"" radio station next to Hoobastank and Maroon 5! In fact, I think even ""American Idoit"" by Green Day is heavier than this piece of cr.ap! This is more like a Megadeth album for non metalheads. Sure a 12 year old girl would probably like this radio ready pop rock ditties, but she would also probably like Avril, Green Day, and all that other cr.ap they play on the radio. Just because the teenybopper set loves pop music doesn't make it good! This album is TOTALLY POP, and I DON""T like it!"
4,MEGAROX!,"hey all you people out there giving this cd back reviews..it's awesome,i'll admit it's nothing close any of thre old metallica songs but hey it is still and awesome cd,who cares if it's more Radio-oriented...it's still the same fricking band! Insomnia is an awesome song,it's so catchy..Crush em' is just great and everythngi thing else is good! Megadeth and Metallica i would say are 2 of the best rock bands out there and it really doesn't matter who's better cause Metallica is but you can't forget Megadeth!"
1,Stinks like a dirty diaper,"How could any band named ""Megadeth"" release a piece of s**t like this album. I wasnt familer with it, since its been years since I have listened to Megadeth (since ""Rust in Peace days"") yet I have slowly been getting back into them and picking up some albums after that period here and there, and most of them arent that good, yet this one really sucks and is a dissapointment to Metal. I guess whatever Metallica had to do, Dave had to follow (of course we all know they crossed over into Alternitive-rock in the mid to late 90's) yet at least Metallica had some OK songs from RE-Load, this one just plain sucks. This isnt worth of the Megadeth name so stay away. There are a million other albums that I would consider before ""Risk"" Hell I even say get Metallica's ""RE-Load"" before this..."
2,Painfully Lame,"Well at least Megadeth is unpredictable. I don't usually write negative reviews, but a trend must be pointed out here. Megadeth seems to release a strong album only about once every other time. This is not one of those times. Besides the cheesy songs, the production ruins this album. It is grating and irritating and not even interesting, just painful. Sorry guys. I don't mean to be discouraging, but I am just stating an observation. And Dave I know you are a smart guy, I know you didn't like Youthanasia. So I am betting you probably don't like this one either. You've gotten some airplay with Crush 'Em. So I was thinking maybe the next album could be non-radio friendly and we could get back down to business. BTW, Nick get back over here."
3,"A Little Too ""Risk""y","When I heard Megadeth was making a follow-up to ""Cryptic Writings"" I was ecstatic as I have been a Megadeth fan for over 10 years and every album has been better than the last, until now.Do not miunderstand me, musically, it shows what Dave and the guys are capable of. In sheer Megadethness, though, it lacks the sound which has become Megadeth's hallmark. It, to me anyway, is not there best effort, but makes for good listening."
5,Risk worth taking,"I bought 'Risk' after hearing it was Megadeth's most unique and commercial album. I was not into super heavy or fast metal yet, and so I was easing my way in with the lighter albums from Megadeth and Metallica. I listened to a couple songs on 'Risk' and was very disappointed. I didn't like any of the songs other than ""Breadline"". I put it on the shelf and left it there for a long time. Funny how time changes things. Maybe I was a little more willing and patient, but either way, I just loved 'Risk'. It's my favorite Megadeth album and one of my favorite albums in general. I don't recommend this to ""true"" metal fans (those who want ""Rust In Peace"" and Master of Puppets"" churned out over and over). However, if you have an open mind and can look past how different this is from their early albums, then you'll probably wind up liking it. Best songs are ""Prince of Darkness"", ""Breadline"", ""I'll Be There"", ""Ecstasy"", and ""Time: The Beginning""...check it out"
1,don't waste your money,"This album was really disappointing. Megadeth have forgotten what got them their fans in the first place: crunchy guitars, interesting arrangements, and tight playing. This album has all kinds of techno/dance touches on it that make it sound ridiculous! The songs are boring, the lyrics suck and there is absolutely no power or aggresiveness to any of the songs. The bonus CD that came with this is really good, however the worst song is the one Megadeth track."
1,What is this?,"Dave has always considered MEGADETH to be the ""number two"" heavy metal band, coming in after METALLICA. Did they think that they could capture the throne with this? Even Load and ReLoad crush this stuff. MEGADETH will forever stay at ""number two"" if they didn't already drop off the chart with this. Oh yeah, did you ever notice that MEGADETH's intro to FFF on Cryptic Writings sounds alot like MOTORBREATH, even if Dave was somewhat part of the band then. I also believe that The Prince of Darkness (I think) sounds alot like METALLICA's Badseed. Listen to the riff."
2,"If you're a true fan, you'd like this??","ok, although i've typed a review here before, i am EXTREMELY sick of people saying that if you are a (ahem) TRUE megadeth fan, you'd like them no matter what they do. They could do country rap, swing, whatever, if you're a TRUE fan, you'd like them no matter what. that's BULL! people like music that sounds good to them, and so why should you like a band if they don't play music that sounds good to you anymore?"
3,"Megadeth's Worst, but buy it for Crush'Em.","This is Megadeth's worst effort and it is pretty weird and also is pretty bad. The reason I gave it 3 stars, is because there are a couple okay songs and ""Crush'Em"" rules all."
4,very good,"you won't be disappointed, that is if you thought cryptic writings was their best so far. the ""professional"" reviewer above simply has no clue. This is a very good album, well conceived and well played. I like it a lot."
5,This CD rocks,"Megadeth always has been good and this cd just proves my point. If you like megadeth at all you must go out and get this cd. Also, with all the good songs on the cd, since it is enhanced, it makes it beter. Now you can see some music videos on it and this makes it even better."
3,THIS CAN'T BE MEGADETH,Good album if they were not Megadeth. The songs are ok but it's not heavy. This is just not them. Might of worked if they released it a decade ago.
4,"Good, but different","Risk is the best title Megadeth could have chosen for their new album. The first four songs are heavy, the rest are not. Good songs but just not classic Megadeth. I was hoping for more heavy, but oh well. Maybe on the next album. Prince of Darkness is awesome!"
1,BUYERS BEWARE!!,"MEGADEATH the grreatest non sell out heavy metal band in history hasent had a cd release since 1997, today august 31 1999 changed that with the cd release of their new cd"" RISK"".i as a life long fan of the band was the first at the store to buy it. to my shock i could not believe what i heard. this cd was not worth the plasic it was printed on let alone the two year wait. the cd is very commercial like metallica is now. i think this band in the past has gotten better with each new cd they have put out. their last cd ""criptic writings"" was the best live show i ever saw and the ""risk"" tour i will be sure to miss. i cannot believe dave released this! sorry guys i cant find more than 3 songs on here i will hear more than twice and its my favorite band. must tell ya something."
1,SOmething went miserably wrong....,"AFter listening just to the opener ""INSOMNIA"", you know something is wrong here. Ok, ok, you will say Mustaine warned us all that this was going to be different, when he called the album ""RISK"". But what a risk !!!! TAken for the sake of nothing, or just to show how MEgadeth can also write lousy compositions.!!! The songs are awful, even without comparing them to old Megadeth stuff."
5,Under-rated,"Here's the real deal. If you heard this album on the radio today (without knowing that it was Megadeth) you would say ""Damn, this CD really rocks. Who in the world is this new band."" The problem was, when this CD was first released, hardcore Megadeth fans were expecting another ""blow your speakers out"" Megadeth album. And, to them, this CD didn't deliver. However, the average hardrock fan would disagree. The music on this CD includes some of the very best songs that Megadeth has ever produced, hands down. Yes, it's more in the vein of Saliva, Fuel or even Cold. But, who's complaining? Not me. So, if you like those bands, buy this. You won't be dissapointed."
1,bad cd,"This is just a bad cd. Not a ""sell out"" or anything else, just bad. I've been a fan since the beginning, although I have to admit I haven't heard Cryptic Writings or The World Needs a Hero...but I've heard everything else and this is bad."
1,Unbelievable!!,"This is the worst release of this great band. Instead of the good musicians they are, this cuts show us how big is the RISC they are taking. As well as Metallica with their Black Album 'turning point' awesome experience, Megadeth is trying to follow the same root but...I do not know...I think they are loosing their north with no turning back. Mr. Hetfield will say: Sad but true..."
1,I Don't Like This Risk!,"Megadeth's RISK is nowhere near my favourite album of the year. The hard rock stuff on this album is a genre long lost and better left dead. They listened to Fleetwood Mac for inspiration for this album. We don't need decent heavy metal bands like Megadeth reviving that style of music.As a pop album it's a failure, pop music is totally different, and as a heavy metal album it is hopeless. The best song is Prince of Darkness, but is weak compared to any song on another album. Cryptic Writings was bordering on sellout, this is way over the line.I only gave this album half a star for ""Time: The Beginning"" and ""Time: The End"" together, and the other half for ""Prince of Darkness"".A bigger RISK Megadeth could've taken is to create a decent speed metal album like they were doing back in the early 1990's (Rust In Peace)."
5,Megadeth should be happy with the wide range of reviews,Having read the hundred plus reviews of Risk - the one thing that strikes me is it is either loved or hated. Megadeth have therefore achieved their aim for this album to challenge steroetyped views of how a band should sound. Innovation and the ability to change is key. You cannot trundle out Rust In Peace time after time as great as that album is it would just get boring.All the songs are excellent due to their diversity. Wll done lads.
5,Addicting...,"I have been listening to this album for the past two weeks since I bought it. I just can't stop listening to it. Their music has seriously evolved into something amazing. This has got to be one of my fave albums in years. Now i'm trying to get it out of my CD player, but I just can't... It's giving me Insomnia... Somebody... Turn out the lights..."
2,"well it's a megadeth cd, but it's a bit sub par","I bought it just cause its new megadeth, however it is a bit lack luster for that band. There is only a few good songs on the cd. Megadeth is is not a commercial band as they are trying to be. Feel that this is Megadeth's weakest album ever."
3,Oops-Megadeth's version of LOAD.,"In my opinion, it's virtually impossible for Megadeth to put out a bad CD, but this is the closest they have ever come to it! It's a good CD, just not a good MEGADETH CD. It's too poppy and the first 2 songs have instrumental breakdowns with nothing but strings on it! where's the guitars!?! ""Ecstasy"" is a standout, but it's so poppy sounding you'd almost expect to hear it on the radio after a Britney Spears or N'Sync song! The band peaked with YOUTHANSIA(their best CD EVER) and have slowly declined from there--I'm still a fan, I just wish they'd rock a little more cos RISK is just too ridiculous. It should have been called NO RISK or MEGA LOAD or something. This CD could easily sit next to a Def Leppard CD! And this is coming from a Megadeth fan since '86. Dave, wake up man! Stop trying to make a hit record!! argh!"
4,new different megadeth style,"This album doesn't really sound like Megadeth. They have changed. It's still pretty good music, but the older stuff is better. I like this album, but it's no comparison to the Rust In Peace material. I think they simply grew out of the speed metal and matured. Still, Megadeth is way better than the Limp Bizkits and Kid Rocks today. Megadeth still rocks man!"
5,reprint of a delightful 1909 ornithological poetry.,"Line diagrams that make the two rhyming birds and flowers resemble another, along with poem, such as this one:""The Plover and the Clover can be told apart with ease.By paying close attention to the habits of the beesFor entomologists aver, the bee can be in cloverWhile etymologists concur, there is no B in plover.""One entry on each page. Helps you to be able to distinguish the Sparrer from the Asparrergus!"
1,Couldn't even finish it.,"This book was horrible. HORRIBLE! I stopped about 3/4 of the way through, completely disgusted. It centers around 2 sisters who are supposed to be each other's best friend. Throughout the whole 1st half of the book they're so sugary sweet to each other I wanted to puke. That's not how sisters usually treat each other, best friend or not. Then, since they're such best friends, one of the sisters has sex with the other sisters man as soon as she possibly can, because she was feeling left out and lonley. Pitiful excuse for a book. But of course, the man they both want happens to have a twin, and the twin is the one that the stupid sister has sex with instead of the other one. Of course. Very lame plot, horrible characters, unlikely scenes, and just flat bad writing. I'm sorry I wasted money on it. Ugh!"
2,A mish-mosh of misinterpretations,"There is nothing progressive about this book. Instead, it contains only a mish-mosh of material that was stolen from a valid tradition of wica, misinterpreted, and then put forth in a manner demeaning of each author's original tradition. Janet Farrar demonstrates huge amounts of disrespect for her original teacher, Alex Sanders. Gavin Bone shows just as much disrespect for his original tradition, Seax Wica and Raymond Buckland who founded it. The only way the title fits this book is if the word progressive means an attack on established Wiccan elders. The cheap shots at Gerald Gardner and Alex Sanders abound. But even then, accuracy is not this book's high point. Where on earth does the sun rise in the West? Despite what this book says, the answer is no where.On the high note, if you enjoy arrogance, you will love this book. On the back cover, the authors are called ""the world's leading experts on the subject of modern witchcraft ..."" What about Ray Buckland?"
1,no authority,"How sad that a Farrar should feel such a need to disassociate themselves from another Farrad, what did Stewsart ever do to deserve this! I suspect that both Stewart and Alex would turn in their graves if they read this book. Words fail me. Any true Alexandrian would feel the same, surely?"
3,Good book but I like the Big Blue better,"I wanted to give this great book four stars, but he just can not top his previously published Big Blue Book. If you are new to Wicca, read this book but read Raymond Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft first. Mr. Buckland knows what he is talking about. Thank you Mr. Buckland for all your hard work in making Wica a valid religion. We won't forget you."
3,Not so traditional,"Farrar and Bone are ""spokespeople for what is now known as Traditional Witchcraft (or even British Traditional Witchcraft). With 35 years experience between them they continue to do the same thing. I think this book is a leveller and they have since moved on and are changing and evolving (i do hope so as i am a fan of their work)"
1,NOT as described,"1. They say it's 5"" wide. Wrong. It's 2 1/2"" x 1 1/4""2. They say it's lighted. Wrong. It's not.3. Big numbers are easy to read but the clock is not lit and it is extremely difficult to set the time on it."
1,Clock loses time and battery cover,"Ordered this clock for a bathroom cabinet so I could get a quick read on the time. This clock loses about 1 min a week, and the battery cover doesn't stay put. I do not recommend this clock."
1,not as described,"states the clock is 5"" x 4"" x 1""......it isn't. it is only 2.5"" x 1"" x .5""......for $8.00??!! I DON'T THINK SO! it is a piece of cheap chinese garbage."
1,Liked it when it arrived.,The size of this clock is perfect... but it will not keep time well. I have owned it for a few months now and keep having to reset the time. Not worth the hassle. Off by over 5 min. per month. Bummer.
2,A waste of money,I have no idea whether this clock works because I can't figure out how to set it. It came with instructions but they were of no practical use. Others said that it doesn't keep accurate time. I wouldn't know.
4,digital clock for auto dashboard,I needed a small digital clock for my dashboard. The CU073360 turned out to be just fine. The numerals are large and easily read; the clock takes up a minimum of space on the dashboard ; and the adhesive keeps it stuck in place where I can easily read the time.
5,"Nice fragrance, but not true plumeria","Plumeria is my favorite scent in the world, so I was excited to try this. It smells really nice, tropical and floral, but not like the leis I so adore. That said, I've used 3/4ths of the bottle, which is rare for me (I am a shameless product junkie...). It's really great for hair, I put it just on the ends and then comb to distribute it. The stuff makes your hair so silky and fragrant, it's hard not to use too much (and make it too greasy).And as others have mentioned, this stuff is solid at room temperature. That's what coconut oil does. Letting it sit in a sink of warm water helps, or just keep it in the shower, where it'll get warm all by it self. I actually melted it, mixed in some plain body oil (macadamia/grapeseed based), and put it in a squeeze bottle. Now it's easier to use, you can squeeze it out of the bottle, like a thick lotion.Will be repurchasing, but probably gonna try one of the other scents next."
3,Thanks,We're very happy to receive the product and the packaging was good. It took a bit longer to arrive than we expected but it was still well within the suggested timeframe.
1,Disappointing,"I had ordered this product, and the company sent me the wrong oil. When I called the company, the customer representative stated that I would get a replacement product, but they asked that I would have to pay the shipping costs although it was was their error. I cancelled the order. I will never order from this company again."
3,Power Romp,"The only trace of irony on Superdrag's third full length CD is the name of the record label - The Arena Rock Recording Co., which is all wishful thinking and hubris for a minor band on a minor label. Yet In the Valley of Dying Stars is a power pop romp and stomp all over the ... of dealing with the terminal cancer of a loved one, very specifically in this case the loss of lead vocalist John Davis's family patriarch. The resulting songs are dark and harsh and, refreshingly, more focused and immediate than their last two releases. The short sharp sonic bursts of songs on ITVODS are more bracing than depressing, and that's a more mature sign of healing than anyone has a right to expect from rock music these days."
5,"""Superfun""","This is definitley their best album yet. So many hit-worthy, catchy tunes. It's sounds like the best Foo Fighters album that the Foo Fighters were never good enough to make. Dynamic and full of energy. be sure to pick this one up."
4,Independence has it's own rewards,"Free of their mainstream one-hit wonder shackles, Superdrag now finds themselves on an indie label, pumping out that same old rocking seventies' vibe. And what's wrong with that? It's the musical hooks that take you back and reel you in, whereas most groups rely on a catchy chorus to keep a listener's attention. ""Keep it Close to Me"" grabs you from the first, ""Lighting the Way"" should be the single, and ""In the Valley of Dying Stars"" dramatically closes out the set. If you miss old school rock and/or roll, this is a worthy purchase. Maybe it's nothing new, but nobody today does it better."
1,just another pop band for the empty tv generation.....,this is just another band that has become the big rotten heep of the mtv generation.its like this all these bands on mtv are kind of influenced buy each other .either if your weezer or super drag or nysc or backstreet boys .or sum 41 or blink 182 its all bands that just sound the same.no good songs no balls just a shadow of good music in general. well see where this band is in 10 years in the discount rack like another can of beans..if these guys dont have a video they will soon and it will probably as dum as some of the foo fighters ones.......
1,unbelievable how bad music can be,"I don't have this album, but I just saw them live. Holy cow, can a band suck any worse? This is the first show where I left and sat outside for a while because it was soooo dang boring. They are so heavily influenced by other bands they wouldn't know what to play if they didn't watch MTV. Wish I could rate them lower than one star."
5,A great primer on horses!,"This treasure is jam-packed with basic info as well as trivia tidbits, such as ""From the Horse's Mouth"" and ""Horse Lore"" highlights. Covers everything from ""accessories"" to ""zoning,"" and is easy, informative and entertaining reading."
1,Read the fine print!!! NOT a FAST charger,"This charger is ultra SLOW for an advertised 2hr UltraFast charger. The fine print says that it takes 2 hrs to charge a 1300 mAH a set of AA batteries. For the supplied 2500 mAH batteries, it took 5 hrs to charge 4 AA batteries. The way the item was priced, shipping would bring the price $26 OR just as much as a local purchase. I stopped using Amazon's One-Click for 2nd party purchases because of this experience. I have had cases where buying new from Amazon was cheaper then the lower priced 2nd party. If you select add to cart, it gets you the time to decide. Also, Amazon has bulk ship for free that makes the purchase easier on the budget.Always READ the return policy OR ask upfront."
1,Not what I expected,"It may have been my mistake I am not sure however I thought I asked for a hardcover copy of the book and I was sent a paperback and the worst part of the whole thing I feel the condition of the book was misleading... I was led to believe maybe the corners were worn etc however all through the book someone has used a orange pen and put lines through every line that has the word ""die"" in it... very disappointed."
2,Color Mixing for Artists: Review.,"Not enough information given. Vary basic, needs more work. I got this book to help me teach a college basic painting course and found that I could hardly use any of it."
2,Looks nice - until you really sit down to learn something,It looked great in the store. But It showed paint colors on the side that pointed to colors in real photos that occationally mismatched??? That's pretty much it! I did not learn anything? I exchanged the book.
1,"once again,you can find better prints in collections that don't cost as much","i love these movie packs but this one really made me mad. i don't expect to get great transfers,but at least i expect to be able to watch the movies!!!! save your money and look at other collections to buy!!!"
5,Monsters,"I ordered the ""Monsters Movie Pack"" which contains 20 all-time favorite monster movies.This will be a gift, so I don't know about the quility.Once I had placed my order, it was here within three business days.Very good seller."
4,Great analysis...,"This book is tough to learn from (because it has almost no motivation), but the text is clearly written and easy to understand.The proofs are elegant and easy to follow. The construction of the reals using dedikind cuts along the rationals is the only construction I've found in introductory books. Other books I used as suplementary to this (Rosenlicht and Bear) did not have this in their texts.After learning analysis, I find this book to be an excellent reference for anything that I might have forgotten or just didn't understand the first time around."
5,GREAT CLASSIC BOOK FOR BASIC UNDERGRADUATE ANALYSIS COURSE,"Stricktly, from a student's perspective, this ""baby Rudin"" is a truly great book. It teaches mathematics, the way it should be taught -- rigorously proving every nontrivial statement, using an axiomatic approach. This is much better than most other undergraduate analysis books, as it has an introductory chapter on point-set topology, so most of analysis is done in general metric spaces, rather than only a real numbers. This is crucial, if you wanna really understand what's the hell is going on. The exercises might be a bit hard, but you have to do them if you wanna learn math. If you started learning analysis from this book, you are in a good shape. YEAH."
2,It is too dense,"I had this book for Analysis class in my Master on Mathematics. Yes, the topics are those that should be studied, but it is too dense. Sections are too long and exercises most of the time need you to have understood all concepts in the section. It has practically no graphics (and graphics are important for understanding). Sadly, it seems more like the author is trying to impress us with his knowledge than wanting us to understand what he is exposing (it is what it seemed to me, just an opinion).I'd prefer a book with subsections and exercises for every subsection: really, if you don't do excersises frequently during the study, you (well, at least I) can't really grasp what is exposed.If you are going to teach (or to attend) a class on Analysis, I recommend ""Elementary Topology"", mixed with other Dover books.En conclusión, el libro es muy denso."
3,Not Careful?,"I had a problem with the fact that Rudin talks about integers and rationals without properly defining them. The first time we see ""positive integers"" is in the proof of the archimedian property of reals. Where was it defined prior to this?"
3,its ok,"I used this book in one of my classes. Its does an ok job for my undergraduate class. However, some areas it goes really in depth with and other its just skims over. Therefore, I give it an ok rating."
3,Meh...,"Imagine you are trying to learn the English language, but the only tool you have is an English dictionary. That is what it feels like using this book. It has a wonderful amount of definitions, axioms, and theorems, and would make a very good reference (much like a dictionary). But as a text book to learn analysis? There are much better choices: Introduction to Analysis by Gaughan is one. It is less expensive and is actually better!Introduction to Analysis (Pure and Applied Undergraduate Texts)"
4,A truly bad place to start.,"As someone who has recentl completed an independent study using this book, I can say that it's difficult, at best. If someone's there to explain things to you, it might work. I personally got much more out of direct questioning of mathematicians than I did out of this book. The definitions are concise; so much so that There are often subtle implications to each which are invisible to the uninitiated."
3,Not an undergrad text,"Like many other reviewers say, there is MUCH left out for the reader to fill in: Definitely not an undergraduate text. Maybe good for the generation when it was first written, or as a reference, but not for this generation of undergrads. Moreover, anyone who defends the use of this book because of its terseness and economy of expression, and all that, doesn't have a clue about mathematical pedagogy (this includes the profs out there giving this 5 stars). The explanatory text in a math book ought to be fleshed out; and a textbook author is lazy or proud (= stupid) if he is not explicit about what he is trying to convey. Let the student reader bang his/her head on the later exercises, but don't make them do this on the text and examples. My opinion, for what it's worth. Four stars for completeness, 2 for clarity and usefulness."
3,"Decent book, but dry","I'll preface this by saying I'm an engineer. I thought engineering books were dull, but this book is even worse. That said, it has all the important theorems and their proofs, but no fluff whatsoever. So if you want just the facts this book would be for you."
3,it is all there - but not easy to extract,"I used Rudin in my freshman analysis class as an undergraduate. I found it fairly difficult to read. It seems as though Rudin fine tuned his proofs mostly for brevity rather than clarity. For a young student of analysis I think it is better to see the ideas and structures rather than to be forced to decipher overly short proofs. On the other hand - I did learn the material pretty well. Still, I would not reccomend this as a first book and certainly not as a do-it-yourself."
4,Math definitions & theorems handbook,"I'm taking this mathematical analysis course over this summer and this book by Walter Rudin is our textbook for the course. The book is a good place to quickly read through the numerous definitions, theorems and proofs that the course contains but it's very concise and so provides very little assistance understanding the concepts in depth.One other shortcoming of this text book is in providing examples. There is a lot of theory and very few visualizations and examples. So I had to use other books on this subject such as the one by Tom Apostol as a reference book for this course.No complaints about this seller on Amazon. The delivery was on time and book was in perfect condition."
2,Setting a trap,"This book sets a trap that can suck any hard- working student into the world of definition, theorem and proof which is what math has been made by these mathematicians. The book has no illustrations and makes sure that no engineer or applied physicist has use of it. This book was probably written with the intention of getting more graduate students in the Math department, who would spend endless hours solving the problems from this book and then get hooked on to analysis. If one reads the follow up of this book which is ""Real and Complex Analysis"" he or she would surely end in this quagmire of definitions and proofs, which has little real world significance"
5,Very clear and sometimes very onerous,"The writing in this book is crystal-clear. You have toknow how to write and understand mathematical proofs; ifyou don't, you'll have trouble with this book. Some ofthe exercises are difficult. Some others are not difficultbut are nonetheless a lot of work. Others don't take verylong but you nonetheless learn a lot from writing out thesolutions carefully. Does this book have imperfections?Yes; I seem to recall that the chapter on differential formsleft me under an erroneous impression that the subject isa lot of technicalities rather than a simple and elegantidea. That's nowhere near enough reason to give this bookfewer than five stars.It's amazing that a book written more than a half-centuryago is still a standard that is perfectly suited to everystudent who is ready for it."
3,For Undergraduate Students,"I think that this book is not good for undergraduate students in the first course of real analysis. Some chapters in this book are very difficult for a beginner to read it. For example, in Chapter Two it looks like you need to know some background about the elemetry topology before you read it. In addition, this book doesn't contain enough examples to explain how to use ""Theorem"" and ""Definition."" Thus it is difficult for undergraduate students to read."
1,Definitely not a teaching tool,"Beautiful, elegant proofs resulting in little or no understanding on the students part. Should definitely be used with a more user friendly version of real analysis. An elegant almost poetic book that fascinates those who were tortured by it back in 1953; the same ones who want to continue the cycle of torture by using this book as a class text.."
5,the Gita of elementary mathematical analysis,"this is the book which introduced me to ""real"" mathematics.i started reading it when i was in the second year of undergraduation and from that moment it became one my favourites (along with herstein's book on algebra and simmons' book on general topology). this book makes you think.(i still remember how that excercise ""is there any nonempty perfect set with no rationals?"" gave me sleepless nights!)Dr.Rudin! thank you for giving me such a nice introduction of mathematical analysis."
5,First-rate introduction to a fascinating and difficult subje,This size of this little volume belies its deep andsignificant content. I learned the art of mathematicalanalysis from Prof. Rudin's book many years ago. Theclear exposition and excellent selection of challengingproblems made learning the subject a thoroughlly enjoyableand intellectually satisfying experience.I have seen quite a few remarks about the price. Fair enough. Hey people at McGraw-Hill? I think you have amortized the fixed costs pretty well by now.....I am morrison@ncssm.edu
3,Use an easier analysis book first!,"Please don't ""learn it yourself"" from rudin. I recommend books by Bryant, Stirling, and Eccles for the learning of analysis. Those are user friendly books with nice explainations. Only use Rudin once you have learned some analysis and proof. Moreover, the price is a joke. Rudin will be at your library so I recommend borrowing before buying. The other reviewers who gave it such bad reviews are probably mad because they didn't use these other user friendly books first and then switch to rudin. thank you."
2,"Save your money, buy simllar books with much reduced price!!","First, I must make it clear that I am not repective to Walter Rudin, his book is excellent. But his excellent book don't not mean other books are not excellent!! Buy the Russiann translation books by Richard Silverman of the books by Georgi E. Shilov on similar topics. If you have 140 dollars,buy 3 or 4 books on real and complex analysis, you still have 100 dollars left to buy other books. I strongly recommend the book Whittaker and Watson's "" A course of modern analysis "", this is the real classics of the classics, think about that, the 4th edition was published in 1927, nowadays it is the best ( if not ultimate reference ) on analysis and special functions. Some reader claims that Rudin's book cited by many books, but compared with "" A course of mdoern analysis "", it is byond comparison and in fact is not in the same "" class ""."
3,Patti Lite.,"This recording would have been better for me if Patti LaBelle had been given material that was worthy of her. Diane Warren has had hits before, therefore, she knows what she is doing. Outside of my favorites, tracks 2 & 4, the rest of the CD seemed to have been pieced together with the compositions coming from one planet and Patti's voice coming from another. The songs submitted did not go hand-in-hand with the performer. I have had heard Ms. LaBelle go off and use her powerful voice to totally overtake the music, and still everything was in sync. In my opinion, with WHEN A WOMAN LOVES, Patti gave it her all, and even though she remained in perfect pitch, the material was not what one would've given a grand and bigger-than-life diva of her caliber."
2,I Love Patti but this ain't happening,Diane Warren is the most blandest Composer ever or at least among the top 3.her songs have no soul or personality.Patti Labelle can sing these songs in her sleep.i mean the material here is 2nd rate leftovers.I Love Jam&Lewis they are Musical Legends.their Genius really shined in the 80's&early 90's.but over time they have become Formula of The Industry.i wanna hear Patti Work With someone who will really showcase her Soul.it ain't happening here.She is one of Those artists that never hardly ever gets the right material to match her Dynamic Voice.if she did it would be a Classic Album.
5,Patti's Still at the Top of Her Game at age 56,"AWESOME, in a word this CD is AWESOME. PATTI with Diane Warren writing and JAM and LEWIS producing is a superb combination. Patti's voice and delivery of each song is wonderful. This CD offers something for everyone from the the dance tracks Too Many Tears and Time Will to the R&B Jams Call Me Gone and Why Do we Hurt each other to the POP songs If I were a River and Love will Lead you back. This is a must have CD for all who want to expereince this Legendary Diva at her best."
2,Nothing Spectacular,"While Patti has had many singles that are quite wonderful, her albums are usually hit and miss affairs and this one continues the pattern. She oversings everything and the chatter between tracks is somewhat distracting. The best track is the title track. It's wonderful. The uptempo tracks, especially Gone, are nice as well and a good change of pace from all the ballads. As for the remakes; If I Was A River, I'd Still Love You More, Tell Me Where It Hurts and Love Will Lead You Back, the definitive versions are still the original ones by Tina Arena, Trisha Yearwood, Kathy Troccoli and Taylor Dayne."
2,Not her best! Too much Diane Warren overkill!,"I don't like this album like the other Patti's albums. The ballads don't match well with her voice. And while she admires Diane Warren, Diane's songwriting here would make fodder for 500 Hallmark card commercials. The sappiness goes into complete overload here. I liked ""Call Me Gone,"" but the rest of the album never matches up to that upbeat song. This is the only Patti album that I don't like as much--the ballads kind of drag here; there's no kind of passion in the songs. But her latest, Timeless Journey, is far, far better than this."
1,Maybe Next Time!,"Patti continues to scream and whine her way through songs. Diane Warren songs were not meant to be song in this fashion. Yes this is Patti trademark, but it is time to show us something new. Sometimes less is better. ""Call me gone"" is how you can discribe this one time fan of her's."
1,Patti Should Retire,"Yes, after this embarrassment, Patti Labelle needs to retire, quickly! The songs are sappy and when Patti is not screaming her way through the songs, she sounds just plain bored and uninspired. Not to mention this CD sold very poorly. The only people she could sell this to were her son, her minister, her best girlfriend and the 2 queens who do her hair and make-up.I was very disappointed with the quality of this CD. I sold mine immediately. I strongly advise any one who is into GOOD music, pass on this one. You will be bored to tears. This is for hard-core Labelle fans only."
4,Very Cute,"I bought this set for my son after searching high and low for a cute bedding set to go with his fire truck bed. It is very cute and my son loves it. It really looks nice in the step 2 fire truck bed incase anyone else is having the same problem. My only complaint would be that the ""comforter"" seems scratchy to me. We will probably only put it on the bed when we are having company."
2,seeing is not believing,I bought this set for my son who is crazy about firetrucks and firemen. I was really disappointed to find that the 'firetruck' pillow featured on the main picture and in the smaller details is not included. It has cost an extra $34 (including S & H) to buy this one feature which looks integral to the set. I have to agree with the other review that the material isn't as comfortable as I would hope - it's just that there are so few bedding sets around with this subject matter
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this product. The only issue with these pens is that the ink flow is very poor, but that's a BIG problem for me. It bleeds around the curves in my letters making the words look sloppy. If I pause for too long I am frequently met with a glob of ink pouring out the second I put the pen to paper. I had a set of these pens a while ago and they were the BEST. Sadly, I could never find them when I went to office supply stores. I figured they'd gone out of business. Naturally, when I saw them on Amazon I was very excited and bought 2 boxes. Bad idea. Now I'm out $20 and have 24 pens that I don't have any desire to use. I would not suggest this product if you like neat and fine lettering."
4,Great Pen,Great pen that keep on writing. Fine point lets you write as small as you need to and perfect balance adds to the fun.
2,Bleeding pens,"The color of this product is pretty light, but the major problem is that the pens bleed all over the page!"
5,BEST PENS,"I used to write with gel pens, rollerball pens, ANYTHING ,but ballpoint. I still don't use ballpoints, but these pens are the exception! The line is clean, it writes smooth, and unlike gel pens the ink life is so much longer, you can get two of these for 96 cents at wal mart! I'm a biology students at a college and I write a lot. Our finals sometimes consist of 20 something pages. I love these pens. it looks good too, and doesn't cost alot. So glad I discover this <3 ps . I put a little gel pencil/pen grips so that it helps when I write for along time."
1,Buy a Different Set! Sticker UPC code slapped on each cap!,"WARNING!!!Avoid the box of 12!!!Mine came today and each pen had a bar code sticker on the cap, as if the pens were for individual resale.The stickers are tough to remove and leave a film, they are not package friendly stickers.I will never buy this box set again, and in the future I plan to stick to the regular packages."
5,Best Disposable Pen!,It has a nice tip and you are able to move it across the page with speed and never lose legibility.
5,Vibrant !!,"Opening with a tour-de-force plush song this CD justs keeps getting better - Meade Skelton is a very gifted performer, a talent like this should be heard. Meade hits each key and note with soothing ambient warmth. The original piece ""Nicole Will You Marry Me?"" is a catchy ode to dreaming lovers. You'll be singin it in the shower lol. This CD will stay in your player."
2,Not that great,"I was hoping for some over the top chocolates to provide my wife as compared to the regular Godiva or Ghiradelli that can be bought at the local malls. This set of chocolate did not make the cut, and my wife noted that Godiva or Ghiradelli was in her opinion better."
5,Great product from a top Japanese company,"We purchased one 3 years ago when we had our first baby. It served us well. Quite, automated and looks great. Now we got a second one for another room in our house. Replacement filters can be a bit costly at ~$45, but they do last long. It's worth the money.We alway like stuff from Zojirushi. Great products and well built."
2,"This is a 700mAH battery, not 900","The cover on this item clearly shows it as a 700mAH battery, not 900 as listed. That took a star right away. I've owned this since June 2012, and got good service out of it for about 3 months. As a NiCad, I always charge it fully then let it discharge quite a bit (or completely) before recharging. As of January 2013, it now holds a charge for barely 2 days with minimal use. The original battery for this phone lasted over 3 years before starting to have these problems. I do not recommend this product."
2,Battery life,"I got this camera as a brithday gift. At first it was sufficient and actually lasted a while but the battery life was HORRIBLE. 2 AA batteries barely lasted one night out and I found myself constantly buying new batteries. The pictures it took were decent and I really had no complaints simply because I took ordinary shots of friends, etc. One day, the camera just stopped working all together.I'm in the market for a new camera, and I'm looking into the Canon Elph because I've heard only good things and I realized that I NEED a rechargable battery.I would never get this camera again."
2,Horrible!,"This was my very first digital camera. At first I was really excited but there were many problems with this product. My biggest problems were as follows:1. The pictures were very blurry. (The pictures could only turn out decent if you had a steady hand and could not take pictures of moving objects whatsoever.)2. Even with flash, the pictures were dark and noisy.3. The battery life was horrible. This product runs on AA batteries and uses them up very quickly (especially with the flash).Overall if you want a decent camera, this is not the product for you. You will save tons of money on batteries that fuel this camera which doesn't even take decent pictures. I do not recommend this product to anyone and your money is better spent elsewhere."
1,Don't waste your money on this piece of junk,"I was very excited when I purchased this camera as it was very small and could fit in your pocket or purse and looked like it took really good/clear pictures. WRONG!! Its the worst camera ever. You must be completely still in order to get decent pictures that aren't blurry and you will spend the cost of the camera plus in batteries. When using the flash it will only take about 30 pictures before you have to replace the batteries. Pentax normally makes great cameras, I don't know what happened with this one. Don't waste your money buying something you'll regret.."
1,"Slow, poor battery life, bad flash and doesn't focus!",What all the others are saying is true. Don't bother.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA,This camera is awful. The shutter speed is so slow. A lot of the pictures come out blurry. The flash still doesn't make the night time pictures come out bright. And the camera eats up batteries real quickly. This camera only takes real strong batteries or the camera won't even turn on at all.
2,You wait for your good pictures.,"This was my first ever digital camera, and right from the beginning I was not overly pleased. It takes SO long for a picture to be taken, that it definitely did not suit my purposes of catching surprise moments. I would have to ask my friends to hold a pose for a good 5-10 seconds in order to get the picture I wanted.It eats through AA batteries like crazy, especially when the flash is on.It does take nice, clean and clear photos however. As long as nothing is moving, or you're not trying to catch a snapshot."
1,Pentax Optio E10,"This camera is absolutely horrible. I bought it without researching enough about it unfortunately, and am now going to have to basically throw it away because I probably wouldn't even dream of giving this thing away. The shutter speed is awful, don't even think of taking a picture unless it's in broad daylight, and the battery is the worst I have ever seen in any digital camera. The pictures that you do manage to take without the battery dying, the memory being full after a few pictures, or it being blurry because the camera isn't completely steady, are mediocre at best. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!"
1,Definately better pentax versions out there!,"This camera has a very slow shutter speed, by the time your piture actually appears it is blurry or grainy. Sometimes your subject is not even in it, that's how slow it is. I am very disappointed, because I have used pentax before and loved it, but this model was a waste of my money. Also the directions for use of the camera are on cd, so you have to use the computer to see how to do something, not very explanatory either. :("
1,It doesn't work!,"It's a total waste of money. I bought this one 'cause the canon A530 I was going to buy was sold out... after playing with this one for a little bit, I returned to the store to get my money back! Awful quality, my cel phone takes better pictures FOR REAL! And yeah, too slow, if you want a steady image, you would have to photograph a statue and use a tripod. IT SUCKS"
1,S L O W and Sad,"I bought this camera hoping to have a small, very compact camera for those few moments when you want to capure a family event or, just a to take memory snapshots.I went with Pentax E-10 knowing it's company's reputation was strong and in the camera industry for decades.This camera needs a lot of light to operate. The flash is only effective about 6 ft. away. The pixel images are blurry at best. The colors that follow are not even close to being vivid, or natural. Out of 200 shots I might have gotten 4 that are usable.This is truly one of the worst cameras on the market. It is so bad I will not even sell it on E-Bay.Please if your looking for a comapct camera that will save great memories.. Keep looking there are plenty of great cameras out there. This Is Not The One For You."
1,stay close to the store while you try it out,"I got this because I really wanted a small camera so I would be able to carry it with me everywhere in small belt pouch. I found that my large sony was always home and too cumbersome to carry all the time. Having had Pentax film camera for years, I relied on this to be a quality camera. I cant say I have had much time to use all the features. I have taken 6 pictures and gone through 6 AA batteries. on the average a set of 2 batteries lasts for 5 minutes, tops. Yes, I have used rechargeable (2500 mAh)and alkaline also.The camera may be small enough to carry around but I cant carry that many batteries."
1,Horrible Camera,"Unless you want to buy a digital camera for a 5 year old, don't waste your money. This camera is way too slow and fragile. You're going to be afraid to push the buttons thinking is going to brake something. Not worth a Pennie..."
5,This Book Is Excellent!,"If you're interested in the problem of evil for Christianity then you must deal with this book. Her arguments are scholarly, rock solid, persuasive and important. I only wish she would update it, since she doesn't deal with recent developments from William Rowe's evidential argument to theists like Wykstra who argue for the CORNEA defense. Still, if you want to deal seriously with this whole issue, her book is one of the best in this area."
5,"Intoxicating, mind-blowing and sensually precise.","Far from being exclusionary and academic, this book bursts forth onto an American spiritual landscape screaming for salient objectivity. Just try to pit your own Deific observations against Weisberger's practical atheism and keenly observant, historically correct onslaught of man's inhumanity to man."
2,"Should Have Been Called ""Pete Parker, Boy Detective""","This tape has 2 episodes of the 70's live-action Spidey show that have a whole 2 characters from the original comix. Spidey (i would hope!) and J. Jonah. The baddies are generic. Thats right no Green Goblin, no Doc Ock, no nobody! Instead Peter uses his reporter skills to act as a Nancy Drew/Hardy Boy type sleuth and investigate insipid crimes and then catch the baddies by turning into Spidey for an entire 5 min. an episode. He doesnt even bust one joke! An J.J.J. is bald! Although his is the only character thats is played with any real enthusiasm.So even though this blows, just seeing ol' Webs in live-action swingin' from buildings and kickin' buttock just brings a smile to my face.Cant wait for Spider-Man: The Movie in 2001!!!!!!"
5,It's Nostalgia-riffic,An epic storyline and awesome artwork make this a must have for any fan of the Generation One comics. Buy it!
4,Excellent problem scenarios,"After you're all through and done reading your meat and potatoes Network+ study books. Test your exam preparedness by working your way through the questions in the Network+ Readiness Review book. If you have no problems with them, you are ready for the test. If not, the layout of the book provides you with the correct answers for each question and why they are so. The wrong answers are explained as well. I thought the network troubleshooting scenarios presented were practical and true to life which reflect well on the nature of some of the scenario questions you'll find on CompTIA's Network+ exam. By the way, each Readiness Review title corresponds to their meatier brother in the Training Kit series so the two go hand in hand. This is very evident because the Readiness Review provides only scant coverage on the topics and is primarily a question/answer book."
5,Dolph does it again!,Another hit for Lungren! This movies contains car chases on top of buildings! Need I say more? Do not miss this action packed movie which I gave a five star rating.
3,Intelligent low-budget action thriller,"This is a modest action film about nuclear terrorism, though it is one in a long line of films starring Dolph Lundgren that feature average storylines enlivened by some above-the-average scripting and some surprising plot twists. There is a diverting appearance in this one from Montel Williams, the talk-show host."
3,Better Than Average Action Film,a great film terrific action scenes Dolph Lungren finally has the role he deserves action blended with comedy. Lungren Plays a hotshot army piolt who gets the unwanted job of following the president of the united states everywhere carrying a black bag containg nuclear launching codes. The most memorable scene in this film was the high speed chase cars driving off one building to another. Sensational Entertaiment! I love this film!
1,Like watching paint dry,You can only suspend your disbelief so much. This movie asks you to throw logic out the window to watch action scenes that are mediocre at best.Sorry - you will have more fun watching Paint Dry than enjoying this POS movie. Skip it - you will be happier you did.
4,A fascinating insight into the world of Mabel Normand,"This book gives an excellent insight into the life and times of Mabel Normand - one of the first women of cinema. Her life was complex and peppered with tragedy. This book fully explores all the hearsay about Mabel's downfall, and looks further into the roots of the controversy surounding the Taylor murder case, amongst other scandals of her time. I would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone."
3,I'd recommend this,"The author starts immediately with a kind of disclaimer - Hollywood's role in appearance versus reality - and she uses this to explain and/or apologize (in my opinion) for her narrative, basically asking the question, ""Who can ever know the truth?"" She also inserts herself throughout the narrative. This tactic, at first, seems disjointed and doesn't lead to seamless reading. However, as the reader progresses, s/he becomes accustomed to this format. So much about Mabel Normand relies on the testimony of others, which is iffy at best. Eventually, the reader is drawn into the story of the woman and the times and is able to associate with the narrator in her investigations. Fascinating person (Mabel). I don't know how else to have written such a difficult biography with the tools and resources the author had. Not the best biography I've read to date (my favorite still is the one ""Clara Bow: Runnin' Wild""), but still a good read. I'd recommend it."
2,Strange book with no references,"Strange book on silent film star Mabel Normand. Each chapter starts with a small paragraph from correspondence with Normand's nephew or elderly nurse or the elderly nurse's caregiver which really don't apply to the story of Mabel Normand. While it appears that the author interviewed many people, there are no references, footnotes, or bibliography to tell you when she interviewed them. She indicated Wallace Reid began his drug addiction after a head injury and I always read it was a back injury. I just think a better book could have been done on Normand's life and career."
3,I HATE TO GIVE THIS A LESS THAN STERLING REVIEW,"but I am somewhat disappointed. Gilbar is the author of GREAT BOOKS, a list of the books he read over a five year period, with short summaries of each book. I still look at that book, though I have had my copy for about 15 years or so. (It is out of print, but you can still find used copies of it through Amazon.) He also edited a great book called READING IN BED which I recommend. So -- Anyway -- when I saw his name on this, I immediately picked it up. And it is somewhat disappointing -- it contains lists and trivia, but less information that is leading me directly to books I might want to read, than the earlier works I mentioned above. This is something you want to take a look at before you purchase."
4,An invitation to browse,"Any who love books will relish this collection of literary trivia: a gathering of obscure book-related facts, definitions, lists, quotes and more which span the history of books from their invention to modern times. From the history and evolution of book companies and authors to reading lists and top works, BIBLIOTOPIA: OR, MR. GILBAR'S BOOK OF BOOKS & CATCH-ALL OF LITERARY FACTS & CURIOSITIES invites leisure browsing."
3,Tale of Appalachia,"Interesting tale of an actual event. It told of a friendless girl caught up in a series of unfortunate events. That her innocence is questioned is logical. There was also a modern element to the story, which made it interesting."
2,This is definitly not her best work.,"I have read, and greatly admired all of Sharyn McCrumb,s Spencer Arrowood books. This one however, was a big disappointment. The tale of Frankie Silver as told by Burgess Gaither was real slow going, and did not keep my interest at all. I finished reading this book, but I found myself very reluctant to continue, which is very unusual for me when it comes to Sharyn McCrumb. My opinion is that Nora Bonesteel should appear more often in this dry novel. She has been a great character in past books, and she should be used much more often."
2,not highly recommended,"This book was a bit drawn out through most of it, then cut short with the very predictable conclusion. The similarities among the two stories included in the book were ridiculous, and it would have made a much better story if she had told just the Frankie Silver story, from Frankie's point of view, starting with the struggle with her husband, the murder, disposal of the body, then moved on to the arrest and trial. Now that would have made an excellent read."
2,Not So Very Mysterious Appalachian Capitol Punishment Drama,"The solution to the mystery is evident fairly early on. The author makes the case that capitol punishment is wrong because the poor and ignorant aren't properly defended in criminal court and are, therefore, likely to be unjustly condemned. 300 extra pages of redundant prose ensue. Some of McCrumb's recurring characters appear here and there, doing nothing to thicken the plot."
2,Reading this novel is like wading through cold molasses...,"If you are looking for a literary exposition on the rural poor in America, I'd look to John Steinbeck. He manages to convey more emotion and thought in 50 pages than Sharyn McCrumb can squeeze out of 400.McCrumb has clearly done ample research for this historical ""mystery"" (where! ) novel, and she clearly did not want to discard a shred of the knowledge she picked up. It's all there... page after page of repetitive descriptions covering farming techniques, dressmaking, the proper way to hang a convict. McCrumb certainly could have used an editor for this book. The plot displays little progression, and the flashy juxtposition of modern and historical murders never ties together in a satisfying way. Indeed, key points in the novel are motivated by characters' intuition (and even mountain psychics!), leading me to think that the author couldn't figure out how to conclude the story."
3,Not quite up to par with her usual novels.,"While I enjoyed this book, I found myself bored through a great deal of the historical sections. This book was much more historical and less ""mysterious"" than Sharyn McCrumb's other ballad mysteries. Many of the below reviews seem to have been written by people who have never read the ballad mysteries, and so it would make sense that they would give this a bad review since they don't understand what they're supposed to be about. Our favorite psychic, Nora Bonesteel, doesn't play as large a part in this one as she does in some of the others (with the exception of Pretty Peggy-O). The best place to start in the ballad mysteries would be the middle three books of the five. And they are DEFINITELY worth the read - especially if you love ghosts, backwoods family history and spirituality and a touch of historical ballads. Read this one last if you must read it but don't expect the same type of book."
3,Character development loses to historical padding,"The premise of this book was good, and parts of it were engrossing. Unfortunately it appeared that the author decided that lifting entire sections from historical accounts of the time period or region would work to fill some pages fast. The characters never came to life and the section on the old duel between one obscure character, who had been briefly mentioned before, and a totally introduced dandy seemed totally out of place. What did it have to do with anything? Too bad, it appears this is a typical example of an author with a good idea, but no energy to sustain the effort."
3,Not worth the bother of wading through for the finish.,"I have enjoyed every other book she has written, no this one. I stuck it out to the end, wading through interminable recitations of unimportant family lineage hoping I would be rewarded. I wasn't. I knew who, why and how ""did it"" long before the end, both in the modern and historical tales. Everybody in this book was too stupid by half. Ms McCrumb seems to be losing steam. Her muse might be tired. I longed for the bite and wit of ""IF I'd Killed Him When I Met Him"". This one read like she put her wordprocessor on autopilot."
3,A book in search of an editor,"The Ballad of Frankie Silver was due out in the fall of 1997, and I suspect that McCrumb found herself with much too much material to handle. The story of Frankie Silver is told splendidly; the reader comes to love the tiny young woman. However, the other pieces of the storyline get slighted. The book desparately needed a solid copyediting; paragraphs and ideas are repeated within pages of each other; details are contradicted or ignored. To blend the Harkryder and Silver stories, McCrumb should have been much more even handed with her material. Make no mistake, parts of this book represent McCrumb at her finest; however, she and her publisher owed to her readers to pay more attention to detail."
4,A haunting and compelling book,"I have enjoyed many of Sharyn McCrumbs books, mostly on audio tape, but I read this one and it is an unusual mystery story, rich in implications regarding the death penalty. The subject is deftly handled so that the reader does not feel clubbed over the head, and the interwoven stories are developed with texture and depth of character (including the character of the region). I would suggest not only this book, but can safely recommend all of McCrumb's work. Thank you Sharyn."
2,"Much (much, much, much) ado about not very much","Sharyn McCrumb is usually very adept at juggling multiple story lines, but this time, I'm afraid, it's not really worth it. Two plot lines are interwoven: the 1831 trial and execution of young Frankie Silver, and Sheriff Spencer Arrowood's present day reinvestigation of a 20-year old crime. An additional two murders are thrown in for good measure, but have little to do with anything. Unfortunately it all adds up to very little. The 1831 diary is a bore, mostly because we know the outcome from the beginning. It ends up being little more than an unending catalogue of vintage minutae, interesting if historical fiction is your bag. The present day reinvestigation is not much more involving, despite McCrumb's always valuable insights into human nature. The solutions to the ""mysteries,"" as they are, are obvious and not particularly revelatory. All in all, not McCrumb's best."
3,"Not the best, but still enjoyable","This is an enjoyable book and was very easy to read. Yes, Ms McCrumb goes back and forth from the past to the present, but all it takes to follow from one time period to another is a capable reader. This one wasn't as spell binding as some of the others of this type, but it does hold the reader's attention. Get the others and read, read read."
5,So ever lasting of a story...,"Shocking, intense, but so realistic of a novel! Each character's tale will stay engraved into our hearts. Brilliant author that brings you into a captivating world of writing and whose root of wisdom cannot help but grow into any willing soul.... I humbly salute you Sharyn McCrumb."
5,Another comment...,I loved this book. She managed to make the mean little town of Morganton come alive!
2,Made in 2005?,"I bought three of these as they were on sale and the price seemed pretty good. However, since the units had a ""born on date"" of 2005, I am informed that makes really only 5 year detectors."
2,First Alert Smoke/Co2 Alarm/Second Rate,"First Alert told me the same with my unit as it only workedfor a year and a half. I sent it back to them and they calledme to say that it was born like five years earlier so""too bad"". Then they told me that it had been in malfunctionmode for some time which means I had no protection untilit started screeching. From this experience, I willnever get another First Alert again."
1,Would have been great if they both fit,"I sent the first pair back as they were too small even though I bought a half size bigger as many of the reviews suggested. I received the second pair and the left one fit fine, but the right one was still too small. I am sending them back, so I can't really give a review. My husband has a pair of Keen's and loves them, though. I may try to purchase a pair in the store where I can try them on first hand."
5,For real American Women,"Excellent shoe. I have high arches and these shoes feel wonderful on my feet. My palntars facita is not complaining either. If you are a round person and need comfort for your feet, these are the shoe!"
5,"LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM!!!","Hands down the most comfortable everyday sandals I have ever owned. They are lightweight and airy but they still provide wonderful arch support and are sturdy to wear. I never feel like my foot is going to slip out of the sandal. I wear them when I am out running errands, when I go for my daily one hour walk, I have even worn them while I am gardening. They cleaned up with nothing more than water from the hose!! I can't wait to wear them to the beach and my pool club this summer. My only regret is that I only bought one pair. I need another pair, in blue this time!!!"
3,"Not very comfy, but OK","The sole is ""anatomical fit"", unfortunately, not for my foot. The back strap is too short and pushes foot too far forward. I expected that for this price it would be adjustable. Finally, the shoes arrived with soles not glued to the top, so Amazon returned me money, which is greatly appreciated, and I attemptted to glue the sole back by myself, hope it will hold for a while. But if Keewn releases products without any quality control, what hidden defects can we expect in other their shoes? Not buying from Keen anymore."
4,Keen Sandals,"After having these sandals recommended to me, I purchased some to use as my footwear for a two months overseas trip. Have been comfortable from day one. The instep support is a bonus. Personally I love red shoes, and these just fit the bill."
2,Wrong Wrong and Wrong,"It is hard for me to dislike this product, because I didn'. The problem is they sent me the wrong color and the wrong size! I didn't return them because they were not returnable. I was just out of luck."
1,Be Aware poor traction on wet rocks!,"Just came back from a hiking trip by the river, my keen sandals had zero traction.it was like hiking on ice!Fell on a rock and hit my head....4 stitches and brain CT scan thanks to keen non grip, super slippery on rocks that are wet sandals, $90 waisted and a big bill from the hospital!"
5,Great pair of sandals! Seller beyond expectation.,"I love these sandals. They are great looking, and so very comfortable, (and there are very few shoes I am comfortable in.) I generally wear a size 8 woman's, which I ordered, and the fit is perfect.This is the first time I have heard about Keen shoes; I ordered another style and color of Keen sandals, which should be arriving soon, and I am looking forward to trying them on. I have a feeling that I will not be disappointed. If so, I can see becoming a loyal Keen customer from now on.Of course, it goes without saying, I am first and for most an Amazoner.I gave my car to my son, so I have to use public transportation, or the kindness of a friend, so I do most of my shopping through Amazon. There is such great variety, and it is always fun and trouble free. I feel very comfortable using Amazon; is a very honest, trustworthy, and sincere organization. I, and all my friends, LOVE AMAZON.COM!"
3,High arches,"I am somewhat disappointed in the product because I find that they don't provide the arch support I was hoping for. My feet, with high arches, tend to cramp in these sandals, and I find them a bit of a pain to put on because the back has to be mightily tugged on. Otherwise, a good product. Given the relatively high price, I would not purchase them again."
4,Pee-yu,"I love these shoes and am on my second pair. The one thing that surprises me is that they get stinky. I've never before had stinky shoes even with playing lots of tennis and being a runner. Thank goodness they are washable, but the stinkies come back pretty quickly. Not a huge problem, but you have to keep on top of it."
3,"Good shoes, but run big","I took a shot and ordered these shoes half a size bigger than my usual 9 because so many reviewers said they run small. They don't. For me they run normal and my shoes are half a size too big. They are going back and in the return process I discovered another brand that I think is a little sleeker.The keens were very comfortable otherwise, but the tightening strap didn't feel so secure. Also they front toe protector looked clunky.If you have wide feet though, these are the perfect width, whereas the Whispers are more narrow in the middle, which I found when I tried them on in the store."
4,Great shoe!,"I was a bit hesitant to order these, but, I am gld I did! I wanted a shoe that would be good for biking. I usually wear my FitFlops, but my husband kept hounding me that I needed protection for my toes. Tennis shoes are just too hot. These shoes were the perfect compromise. Toe protection and still a sandal! They are just as comfortable as my FitFlops - I can even wear them all day at Disney! The only downside is that they are heavy...about as heavy as tennis shoes, but still heavier than other sandals.I ordered a half size bigger because I like toe room for my long toes. I did try on the shoes at Gander Mountain to determine the size.Overall, great shoe - great price (less than Gander Mountain) - and I am very satisfied. :) Look out bike trails!"
4,Great shoes for dog lovers,"Keen should be proud - the Venice H2 is the only pair of shoes my dogs have NOT been able to chew apart! And they've tried!!! They are tough, have great tread, and unlike others, I do wear them with socks (I bought the black pair and wear them with black socks when it's colder outside). The only thing I do not enjoy is when I walk through stones or pebbles, they sneak into the holes in the shoe and get caught underneath my feet. Otherwise, this shoe is worth the price because you will own them for years with no sign of wear, even if your dog chews on them."
5,Comfy!,First time owning one of these and liking it very much so far! Plan to wear this on my upcoming outdoor trips.
4,"Comfortable,but","Very comfortable! Perfect for the Galapogas where we had wet landings, then had to walk on volcanic rock. However they were not very easy to get on. Would have liked Velcro closures rather than the elastic."
5,Love these sandals,"I love everything about these sandals and have bought a couple more pairs in different colors. They are so comfortable, easy to wash, fast to dry and do not obtain an odor after they are worn and washed or even wet while you have them on. Love them."
4,Great shoes!,"Love these shoes. They are great for boating, swimming in areas where there are a lot of rocks, and trudging through muddy riverbanks. I have been told they look like corrective shoes, but they are so good I don't care. Love the purple color too. The only problem is these run a little bigger than my last pair and they don't do exchanges or I would just get the smaller size. It is inconvenient having to return, wait for the credit, then re-buy. That's why they got 4 and not 5 stars."
3,Hmmmm.....,"I bought these shoes for a trip to Costa Rica because i knew i would be doing lots of activities. They definitely were comfortable for short easy hikes and just walking around in general. However, when i wore them for a short hike after white water rafting, they had no grip on the wet rocks. My foot even got stuck between two rocks after i slipped. I thought i was going to have a ""127 hours"" experience!! (But i was able to wiggle my way out of it!). So as long as you don't have to walk on wet/smooth rocks, i guess you're fine. But if you are, i would get something with more grip."
5,Everything I hoped for,"These shoes are my new staple. I take then everywhere I go. I have hiked miles in them, river walked, river rafted and traveled all over with them. Yes like others have said sometimes rocks can get in there but seriously I just lift my foot and hold the shoe out a tad and they fall out. It's nothing to stop my love for these shoes. I bought my cousin a pair when she volunteered in Africa and she too shares my love."
5,So very helpful!,"I recieved this as a gift. This is my first pregnancy, and so far this has been the most helpful book I've come across. It's more realistic than most books, EX:) It doesn't tell you to eat exactly the food pyramid... because we all know none of us will do that, instead it tells you more achievable options.The book is full of a TON of useful information, from start to finish of pregnancy and even mentions things such as multiple babies, Vegetarian Mothers, and other ""odd"" things that many books neglect to mention.It helps you prepare for food intake, shopping, medical questions, what you're allowed to eat/drink/take/use, etc... I would DEFINATELY recomend this book."
5,Great information & pictures!,I really enjoyed the way this book was set up. Thick pages with colored pictures and easy to read format. Lots of great information!
3,It's ok,"I am pregnant for the first time and I bought this book. It has a lot of useful information. It really allows you to better understand what your body and baby are going through. However, the chapters are split up in 4 week intravals and you can pretty much read that in 20 minutes. I like to have something to look forward to reading each week. I also have Pregnancy Week by Week and I ready that thru my 1st pregnancy and am also reading it again. I would recommend that book over this one. I just didn't like how you read for the whole month just a few pages."
5,Absolutely LOVE IT!!!,"I loved the images more than anything! The info is also great. But just looking at what my baby looks like because of the pictures, made me not want to put the book down at all. It has great information on nutrition, health, wellness and excercise and also on things to avoid and what not. Wonderful book to read during pregnancy, especially when it's your first baby!!! And to tell you how good it is, my OB dr recommended it but I already had it!"
4,Great Book,I thought this was a very informative and well-written book. As a first-time mother-to-be I was scared to death and had no idea what to expect. I felt this book gave me a lot of information and was well-balanced in offering views and information on the the different options and issues concerning pregnancy and childbirth.
2,Didn't care for it.,I'm pregnant for the first time and grabbed this book because my local store didn't have What to Expect. While I'll agree that the book is informative - I wouldn't agree that all the information in the book is accurate. I also felt that most of the information on choosing where and how to deliver was incredibly biased and pointed toward choosing a midwife.
1,Pro-life readers beware.,I loved this book until I started reading the fine print. Anyone who is pro-life will not appreciate the references to termination. It is also seemingly bragged that few down syndrome babies are now born due to early diagnosis and abortion. I find this to be a sad fact rather than something to rejoice over. The book was fantastic except for those parts which took the joy completely from this book. Many pregnancy books discuss medical issues without having to suggest abortion. It ruined the book for me. I tossed it.
5,Natural is one of the best boybands!!!!!!!,"OMG!!!!!!This cd is awesome, it brings back memories when I met them in 2001 at a mall near Chicago. They were such nice and talented people to meet. I'm glad that I finally got this cd over the years that I wanted it. I would recommend this one to any music fan or Natural fan out there. Great debut cd from this talented boyband, it's definitly worth the try. Way to go Natural, and I wish you all the best in the future to come. Natural rocks!!!!"
4,CATCHY SONGS!!,"BIG DANGER DANGER FAN SO I KNEW I WOULD LIKE IT..!!SOME GREAT SONGS ON HERE..SHAME IT WASNT A BIGGER SELLER THAN IT WAS.....IF YOU LIKE GOOD MELODIC ROCK THIS CD WILL PLEASE...BEST SONG- 'STEPPED INTO MY UNIVERSE"" HOW CATCHY IS THAT SONG!!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I was very excited when I ordered this CD and paid 15 bucks for it. When it arrived and listened to the 1 hour and heard a general overview but really no concrete information, I feel I wasted my money. I was expecting a lot more from this speaker."
3,Good Info But.....,"I read evovle your brain, and I've seen What the Bleep, and I'm itrigued by Dr.Joe's information.... This CD didn't cut it, it didn't meet my expectations at all due to the quality of the recording and the brief information it provided,(being in the price range of $15 dollars plus) I kinda wish that I would of followed my first mind and went with, one of the first reviews that was stating this same issue"
4,Another hit from Shalvis!,"I'm a huge fan of J. Shalvis books. I love how realistic the romances are between the hero and heroine. Blue Flame was an excellent read. Jake is a firefighter who gets injured on the job. He decides to get away from it all by going to the ranch (Blue Flame) that he inherited from his father. The manager of the ranch (the heroine) doesn't want Jake coming there because she is afraid that he will sell the ranch. She has been saving up money to buy the ranch for some time. Plus, Jake and her had a previous encounter that she can't forget. When he goes to the ranch, things quickly heat up between the both of them again. The only problem is bad things start happening at the ranch at the same time that Jake shows up. Blue Flame is a wonderful read. I especially like how in her books she has interesting secondary characters that I like to read about as well. This book is more like 4 1/2 stars!!!!"
1,Kitchen Aid knows they have a problem!,In plain words dont spend your money this is the worst coffee maker on the market.And once more Kitchen aid knows it. No matter which way you pour water in this coffee maker it goes all over the counter very poor design.Kitchen aid has replaced this coffee maker 3 times for me all of which have different problems from the sensors to the water mess this applaince is not worth the money even with there warranty.It should not even get 1 star.
1,junk,"This coffeemaker is junk.I'd throw it away,but I paid 300 dollars for it.Most of my kitchen small appliances are Kitchen Aid and they're fine,but this thing is a joke. The carafe leaks every time you pour,either to fill resivoir or pour coffee.Sometimes you put in 8 cups of water and get back 4 cups of [very strong] coffee and sometimes you get 10 [very weak] cups.You never know.Worst coffee maker I ever owned,a 10 dollar Mr. Coffee is better.I'm done with Kitchen Aid"
1,kitchenaid proline coffee maker,"very unimpressed with this product. so so coffee, but what's worse is the ""safety"" feature that shuts off the warming burners after two hours with no capacity to bypass. this makes it totally unsuitable to the office use it promotes."
2,Very disappointed,I have been having trouble getting the coffee maker to turn on!! If it has the least bit moisture under the coffee filter attachment the machine will not operate. Very disappointing. I am ready to return it if it wasn't such a hassle.
5,Starbucks at home,"This is a great coffee maker. Small market for a coffee maker in this price range, perhaps, but this machine makes the closest coffee to Starbucks I have found. Looks great, runs quiet, what a machine. Worth every penny (particularly when you consider how average the typical $99 krups machine is). I highly recommend this machine."
4,nice low carb replenisher,I use this when playing tennis matches. Most electrolyte drinks are much too high in sugar and carbs for my liking but this one is not and is also good tasting. Will definitely reorder.
3,OK but not what I was looking for,"I was looking for the same type of dried strawberries you find in Special K Red Berries. These were OK but if you pop them in your mouth right out of the can they are difficult to eat, not crispy after they are in your mouth - not sure how to put it other than they stick to your teeth. They are really good in oatmeal and I imagine in anything else where they would be cooked or otherwise re-hydrated."
5,Just like special K berries!,I am very satisfied with this product. The are crispy and delicious. I will buy them again.
4,Excellent buds,"I compared these Remix earbuds to iPod's included white plastic ones. Pros are the superior bass response and treble clarity. After a direct comparison, there was no question that the Remix were better. Even the bass was clearer as well as more defined. The phones are very cool looking, metallic rather than plastic. They didn't fit my ear canals as well as the iPod ones, though with the foam covers, they actually fit better. The only con is the price, but as many other reviewers have said, you get what you pay for and these are clearly better than the cheaper (well, included) iPods."
3,"Good sound, looks, and service. Flawed design.","These earbuds are not indestructible. In fact, they are much more fragile than the stock iPod buds. The culprit is the metal headphone plug extension, from which the cord protrudes. Metal looks good but functionality is a dud: the cord easily breaks from rubbing against the metal during normal use. Apple's stock headphones have a soft plastic plug end and in that are much sturdier. This is a design bummer by the manufacturer. I have gone through four of five of these headphones with the same inevitable outcome. V-Moda's service is excellent but I do not want to rely on the service frequently, and so I will be buying from another vendor (probably Apple).Also, the banana wrap cord thingy is a gimmick with no useful value whatsoever. It is too heavy to wear, as its weight pulls the buds out of your ears, especially if you dare move your head just a little. It might be ok for storing the earbuds, though, if you can not stand the aesthetics of loose cords."
2,V-Moda Earbud,The earbuds look and sound nice... but the weld from the earbud to the section with the company name broke.
1,Tiger Direct shipped different item,"Ordered a pair of V-Moda ReMix M-Class earbuds through the Amazon website. Easy. What was shipped was something completely different. That happens, so OK... Tiger Direct was contacted and could have cared less about the wrong item being shipped. I spoke with an employee who seemed indifferent and would not answer questions about the shipping, despite her saying she handles nothing but the shipping of orders. Very frustrating. Tiger Direct scored a big zero in the Customer Service Dept. Not what I expected from an Amazon.com vendor. The V-Moda products are good - the vendor, Tiger Direct is not. Beware..."
3,Decent earbuds. Not worth the money though.,"They are fairly comfortable, light, and they come with nifty little rubber thing that you can wrap the cord around to keep it the right length. But I thought the audio quality was lacking. These were merely average as far as far as earbuds go and I have another set that was about $15 that sound just as good. In fact, quality-wise they are nearly indistinguishable."
5,a beautiful book,"A beautiful re-translation. Close your Bible, pick up this book, and read it with someone you love."
5,Fabulous Guitar -- a must buy!,"This is without a doubt one of my best music purchases of the past year. As other reviewers have noted, you don't have to like surf music (acoustic, or not) to love this album. I also highly recommend a follow-up album called ""Plugged In & Live"" which is just awesome (this live album has the amps and reverb, which one reviewer here said makes music ""real"" surf music! :) It's fabulous too. Steve"
4,super,Very clearall information about morgan 3wheelers! From the early history till te cars that we know.
4,"good advice, if you can follow it","There are things here about the psychology of people who are shy, different kinds of shyness, some root causes, things you can do about it, how to not raise shy kids, and some benefits of being shy (e.g. tend to do good work that would be hard for flighty or gregarious people -- intense research, etc.)The co-author is a psychologist or psychiatrist, and probably contributed the theories.My only complaint was that being shy was occasionally refered to as selfishness in other clothes.All in all, there is some good advice but it didn't change my life or anything."
4,Great Ring,Bought it for the fiance and she loved it. She couldn't be happier with any other ring and the only downside is it needs to be resized now but thats not the fault of anyone.
5,From the Author,"(...)The book contains eight criteria to assist someone new to firearms in choosing their first defensive handgun. The goal of this booklet is to help someone make the right choice when they select their first handgun. If you are just coming to terms with the need to provide for your own safety but have little or no past interest in firearms, this booklet is for you. If you are just now considering the purchase of a handgun for self-defense, this booklet was written with you in mind. If you are a person friends look to as an ""expert"", I hope you will find this booklet worth recommending. If you are looking for a firearm for a military or police environment, this may be helpful, but certainly not comprehensive. There are other books by authors with extensive military or police experience that will be more suitable for you."
4,were are the acoustic songs?,"well i bought this cd because the editorial review says there are acoustic versions of spoke in the wheel, bridge to cross, stillborn and the blessed hellride, but there not here! in fact, spoke in the wheel and bridge to cross are not here in any form! and it contains the original versions of stillborn and the blessed hellride. all of the tracks on cd 2 have been released before. if you have all of the cds with the bonus discs, you already have everything on this disc. even the videos arent anything new, if you have the dvd, you have 2 of the three videos. the only one extra would be counterfit god, which is cool. so all you get here that you dont already have are the 2 new tracks. some one needs to fix the editorial."
2,Not Very Good,"Black Label Society is one of the few bands that plays real metal (as opposed to the likes of Limp Bizkit or Linkin Park), and they've put out so many great songs. But while the songs on here are good, they missed some of BLS's greatest songs like ""Stoned and Drunk"" and ""All for You."" Of course, if you are getting into BLS, this is a decent place to start, just know that there are great songs that were left off of here as well (motivation to pick up the individual albums). The two new tracks are pretty good, but people that already own the majority of the songs on here need not pick this up just for those two songs. This is just one of those albums that comes out after a record company loses and band, and release a (usually terribly put together) greatest hits package to take as much money from the band's fans as possible."
2,Weak,"Hey, ""Losing your mind"" and ""Horse called war"" are not BLS songs! They are Pride & Glory songs, the first band Zakk put together. And the Pride & Glory album remains as his best effort so far. And ""Sold my soul"" is not a BLS song either! It's from a Zakk's solo album called Book of Shadows, which is also great. Well, now looking at the real BLS songs, every fan can notice that the best songs are not there! What compilation is this one? Where are songs like ""The beginning at last"", ""Graveyard Disciples"", ""Just killing time"", ""Destruction overdrive"", ""Suffering overdue"", ""Damage is done"" etc. etc.????If you don't know BLS and wants to get started with this compilation, don't do it! You better start with one single album, ""1919 Eternal"", which is much better than this compilation here!"
5,A little bit surprising...,"If this one's supposed to be a Zakk's (without the madman,of course) compilation,why don't include a few Mafia or Steel Dragon's tracks? And what this album has to do with the other one with the same title,2 discs and acoustic takes of Zakk's songs?I don't understand...Any help on this will be welcome!Why 5 stars then? Because doesn't matter whatever Zakk does,because like the king Midas he turns it into gold in at least a 90% of the times!And this is no exception,although i haven't listened to the new 2 tracks yet.I bet they are fine too.thank you very much!Thanks the guy above,the one from Memphis(can't remember his name...),for the information about this CD that i was asking for.Greetings from Spain!"
3,It's ok!,A little disappointed with this comp. Would have been alot better with some heavier tracks in my opinion.
1,Not what it says it is ...,"The advertised 1800 mAh at such a low price (from eforcity) intrigued me, but upon arrival it turns out that this must have been a classic bait-n-switch deal since the battery is a generic type with little or no information on capacity or manufacturer. In fact, it doesn't even list a number for capacity. Just like a previous reviewer, I am using this battery in an EOS 20D and while I didn't have the same failures, the true capacity seems to be way below 1800 mAh. Compared to my original Canon battery with 1300 mAh (2 years old), the new battery doesn't last much beyond half the time it would with lower rated original. Stay away from this one!"
4,Great book,These true stories from when back woodsmen were from hardier stock. Well written and engaging from a biologist who knew some real woodsmen.I've always gotten the impression that people have become less trigger happy from the wild pioneer days before wildlife laws and the increase in anti-hunting but this book shows that 'back in the day' people who were out in the bush had more experience living out there (not just flying in) so they gave bears more chances to investigate camp and leave whereas current fly-in types would shoot out of fear. I have great respect for those guys.
3,"WARNING: does not work with ""bass BIG MUFF pi""","This item is listed as ""frequently bought together with bass BIG MUFF pi'"", but it does not work this pedal. One needs the adapter with a negative (hollow) center. This is really Amazon's failure -- not anything negative about the product or company that sells it."
1,Nothing wrong with the adaptor...it's Amazons fault,"I wish I had read the 3/11 review before I purchased this. It does not work on the Electro Harmonix Big Bass Muff Pi. So amazon has known about this bundling error for over a year yet they keep on selling it. This review does not reflect on the product or the excellent service from GearNuts, just on Amazon failing to correct known problems."
4,Great profile of Chicago artists like Carl Weathersby,"The Chicago Music Scene resonates with a broad range of sounds and styles. Electrified Blues, Hip Jazz, Hot Latin and Lively Irish music are all frequencies coloring the Windy City's bandwidth. Tune in to the scene with this CD featuring tracks from some of Chicago's most treasured artists and use the included ""Club Locator Map"" to navigate your way through the night life. This sampler features performances by Carl Weathersby, Koko Taylor, and Junior Wells. All this great music plus a booklet with a guided tour of these Chicago clubs:- B.L.U.E.S ETC- BUDDY GUYS- CHIEF O'NEALS- FADO- THE GREEN MILL- HOTHOUSE- THE IRISH OAK- JAZZ SHOWCASE- MAMBO CUBAN CUISINE- NACIONAL 27- ROSA'S- ZAFIRE"
3,Looks great! Is great?,"I should start off with the statement I would definately buy this again because my daughter loves it so much. Unfortunaely its typical of this type of toy. Nothing stays together very well and the back drop on the stage is plastic and cardboard so it does not stay attached to the stage floor well.Notes about the product:-This is a dancing Polly so her boots are permanetly attached to her feet.-Only dancing Pollys will attach to the pegs on the stage that make them dance (a total of 2 at the same time).-The stage has a speaker and when you use the knob to make the doll dance, music starts and you hear that ""Poll lol lol lol Polly"" they sing in the commercials.My daughter loves the dancing and the music that goes with the stage. She carries the stage (no back drop or speakers attached) with the dancing Polly attached to it everywhere. So as long as you don't expect too much it can be a good choice."
5,Strap yourselves in...,"This is it...probably one of the best mixes ever to be captured on one cd. This magik mix, the first of many, is what sets Tiesto apart from the rest of the pack. Nobody, not even Paul Van Dyk, Oakenfold, or Armin van Buuren, NOBODY can mix, produce, or simply pick good tunes like DJ Tiesto.From the minute you put this in your cd-rom drive, you will be mesmerized, at times to the point where you will want to get off your seat and dance...it is THAT good. The vocals, harmonies, and beats of each song are so well-coordinated into one continuous sound that you will swear this was mixed digitally and not by mere hands. Magik is certainly an appropriate name for this album because there was definitely a good amount of it utilized in the inception of this mix.No matter how much criticism Tiesto receives or how bad any of his recent sets may have been in the eyes of those resentful of his popularity and success, he will always be #1, simply for this mix alone."
5,a new era is born,Dj Tiesto is a dutch men and he is extremely populair in Europe. Now it's the turn of America to discover him as the best dj who bring you to a world full of dreams and thoughts.This is Tiesto's first Magik and his best Magik because he creates a very atmospheric world ful of beautifal epic dreamy melodies.When you listenen to it just close your eyes and let you go to the wonderful world that Tiesto shape.
4,Who's th artist?,"I love this album. Magik 1 paves the way for all the other great magik albums. Dj Tiesto is a GOD! I have a question though. Who does ""Into the Sun""? I love that song and I don't know the artist!"
1,Meaningless melodies,"wouldn't recommended this album. meaningless and repetitive melodies. get Aurosonics's ""Alway Together"" album if you want some meaningful tracks"
5,Great Up-beat compilation,This CD is great for workouts. The music is very upbeat and the remixes are incredible.
2,careful----,a great-great band-but not a good recording-get the studio records-they are just far better all around.

5,Astro flies the music of the stars!,"This CD captures the music of the 1983 Astro Boy anime series. The actual music used in the anime series is captured in this CD, but only if you have selected the Japanese audio of the DVD series. It was allot of fun to watch the anime in its original language while watching the Japanese sub-titles. I think I'm wearing out the CD having grown fond of the music.The music quality is excellent and if you don't mind the Japanese lyrics, its fun to have playing in the background while you are working in your home office or late at night if you just need some quiet music to read by or do work on the internet.Great value for the money. Thanks Amazon for offering this in spite of the fact the CD had to come all the way from Japan. Delivery was on time and the quality of the disk and packaging is just fine. No complaints."
5,Classic animal stories,"A student-centered language arts and reading program, part of the Interaction series of readers.Animal Stories: TrueFanciful Stories (Interaction: A Student-Centered Language Arts and Reading Program)This volume contains:""Nobody's Cat"" by Miska Miles""A Visit by Charley"" by Thad Turk""Kari the Elephant"" by Dhan Gopal Mukerji""Wilbur's Escape"" by E.B. White""Rikki-Tikki-Tavi"" by Rudyard Kipling""Shag - Last of the Plains Buffalo"" by Robert McClung""No Retreat for a Cat"" by Jim Kjelgaard""The Buckshot Ram"" by Irving Crump"
5,Saftey glasses,"These are awesome! I had some Snap-on safety glasses but these work sooo much better. Other glasses that I've used make me dizzy after about 10 minutes, but these are barely noticeable. Sometimes I question myself whether I even have them on, they're very discreet."
5,Great Safety eye wear! A must have!,"I've been using these now for over a year. They seem to last a long time without losing the tint. The scratch resistance surpasses any other brand I've tried. I've got to wear SG everyday for work, so it's imperative to have an easy wearing eye protection. The slight tint is just enough to dim down the bright inside lights of this factory. For this price you can't go wrong! The style is so cool everyone here at work wants them. A MUST HAVE!"
1,"BEWARE - This is NOT ""Little House on the Prairie""","I didn't read the title carefully enough. It is certainly misleading. This is a simple summary with pictures and seems somewhat pointless. I thought I was getting ""Little House on the Prairie"" for my 8 year old granddaughter. I cannot imagine that this version would be of interest to her or to her 5 year old sister. I plan to just donate it to the Friends of the Library Sale. Maybe someone else will like it."
2,I expected better!,Serious puzzle solvers should probably stay clear of this one. Its cleverness is a bit too sophmoric; the definitions are too often imprecise; and there are too many surprising errors contained within. On the whole I found the experience annoying and couldn't wait to finish the book and throw it away.
2,"Good to follow, but make sure you get a CORRECT copy!","I am a huge chart follower. I am in total heaven with the 80's edition of Joel Whitburn's Billboard Hot 100 Chart book. I received the 90's edition for Christmas, and again, I was thrilled. I was just going through it some more to track a song I was listening to, and realized that the charts from May 31, 1997 to the end of '97 are totally missing. It leaps from May 24, 1997 to November 13, 1999. It then goes to the end of 1999, then lists all the songs that hit the Hot 100 in the 90s, then starts back up with the January 10, 1998 chart. I don't know how I missed this when I first got the book, but I am not amused and wanted to warn others that might order this book to check this out right away. I'm really disappointed that I didn't notice this right away. For all the other information outside of the last half of 1997, it's a great resource."
1,NEVER RECEIVED,ORDERED EARLY DECEMBER - NEVER RECEIVED. EMAILED LAST WEEK AND NO REPLY. HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND WAIT UNTIL THE HOLIDAY CRUNCH WAS OVER. BUT STILL NOTHING AND WHEN I SAW THE AMOUNT OF POOR REVIEWS THIS SELLER HAS RECEIVED THIS MONTH WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT - I HAVE GIVEN UP EVER RECEIVING THE BOOK. AMAZON NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING.
5,A delightful story that would delight all ages.,My husband and I each read this book to our granddaughter who had gotten it at a library in their city. We both enjoyed it so much we have spread the word and are looking to purchase it for ourselves. The characters are so delightful that you find yourself getting caught up in the story. You can read it again and again and see more ways in which he artfully blends words with a wonderful sense of humor. Some of the nuances might be lost on younger children but there is so much there for all ages to enjoy.
4,Old Tyme Baseball Costume,Got this costume for my son for Halloween..he really like it! The material is pretty sturdy & colorful too. It was very roomy & easy to move around in. He looked great! Thanks very much!
1,"Terrible quality, product, and looks nothing like the picture","This is a terrible product. The material was so cheap that even though it was big on, it still ripped along the crotch halfway through the night. It did the job but had I know how terrible it was, I never would have bought it."
1,Terrible experience with these,"I bought these for my Les Paul, and they were sold to me as being the 'best on the market'. Several times after installing them I noticed the nut was coming loose, which is pretty scary considering when you have strap locks you usually handle the guitar in a very cavalier fashion, expecting everything to be secure. Then, I lost one of the nuts. Guess what...you can't replace the nut, its M10 x 0.75 metric nut which is basically impossible to find. I attempted to force an M10 x 1.25 nut on there and ended up breaking the whole thing. So, I would strongly NOT recommend these because they kept coming loose, and the replacement nut costs just about as much as a new set."
3,Three Potential Failure Modes - Beware!,"I have always preferred Schallers, even with the fact that you have to check the nut from time to time. But in the last several weeks I've found two additional failure modes. If you play a weighty guitar, the strap button on the neck end of the guitar can come loose. It can unscrew itself. A few weeks ago I found strap button half-way out of my LP Stnd! Then yesterday, my son's strap button on the neck end would not 'lock'. Why? The 'head' of the button was so worn down that the 'piston' would not engage. The strap lock was 3 years old. If you keep the above failure modes in mind (and don't play very much) and periodically check your strap locks, you should be OK. But if you're an active practicer/player and absent-minded...I think the other popular brand/design is a safer bet. Sorry Schallers."
5,Work well (with caveats)..,"I've used these straplocks for many years on all my electric instruments; they're fairly inexpensive, and I've never had a problem with them, never broke one nor had to replace them because of wear/abuse, and I've NEVER had a guitar/bass hit the floor. A couple of warnings here, which have nothing to do with the quality of the straplocks: 1.) you need to make sure the screw is snug in the hole; some people put a matchstick, toothpick, piece of paper or SOMETHING inside the hole to tighten it up if the hole's too big or has been stripped out; I use a touch of Elmer's Glue, screw in the straplock, and let it sit for a day. 2.) You have to make sure the ends that fasten to your strap are securing enough of the strap so that it doesn't work itself off the end; use a socket to get the nut really tight. New straps seem to be easier to secure."
5,"Great Product, Great Design","I've never had any accidents with my strap coming loose and my guitar falling to the floor, but I have had cases where the strap has slid off the strap buttons. Fortunately, I was holding onto the guitar each time it happened!I've had the Schaller strap locks for about a week and have been very pleased with them. I installed them on my 335 without any issues related to size of the screws, etc. I've used my guitar in both a rehearsal and a gig. Obviously, putting the strap on and taking it off is a different process and takes a bit of getting used to, but I consider this insignificant compared with the benefits the strap locks provide.I now play/practice with more confidence knowing that my guitar is secure around me and won't crash to the floor accidentally. Although, the buttons that screw into the guitar body are paired with parts that are firmly attached to the strap, I like that the buttons are designed to be used with other straps if needed."
4,Small price for protection,"Does its job and does it well. Note on a Les Paul, the provided screws will not work. On the top strap button (close to the neck) the original screw will work fine but on the bottom (behind the bridge) Gibson uses a larger screw (not sure if this is true on all models) for when they hang them to dry. This larger screw will not fit through the straplock button so some modification to the strap lock or the guitar must be made ranging from the popular toothpick-in-the-screwhole technique using the original screw to (my personal choice) drilling out the strap button and machining (or filing/grinding) down the screw head a bit.One flaw in the design, as can be seen in the picture, the nut holding the strap in place is on the outside. If this nut comes loose...well... make sure this nut is tight and check it often. However, I have used Dunlop straplocks and find these superior."
3,does the job,"these locks are pretty effective and once installed, easy to attach and detach. I had had a problem with my strap slipping loose a couple of times in the past and these seem to address that well.Installing on my guitar strap was much more difficult than I expected. The product could be improved by having a longer threaded stud on the piece that goes through the holes on the guitar strap."
3,"Nice design, save for one glaring omission","Solid design and engineering. I like the strong alloy screws included - stronger than stainless steel and much stronger than common wood screws.One major complaint; the system will not work on my Les Paul without modification. The supplied screws are #6 size, while my Gibson uses #8 on both ends. I modded #8's to fit, but Schaller should offer a version for Pauls."
1,Fell apart after 6 months,"I read all of the positive reviews and decided to purchase for my Les Paul. After just 6 months, the bottom peg fell off.Not the quality I expected."
4,Good Product,"The only thing I would suggest to Schaller is to make the threads an eighth of an inch longer to accomodate thicker straps, they'll fit but you might have to trim leather and I have a hard time trimming leather on an expensive strap"
5,Wonderful product!,This set is so very durable and is an adorable little set! My DD loves it! It's much sturdier and better made than Melissa and Doug wooden doll house pieces.
3,the washer and dryer are fun,The washer and dryer get played with at our house. The other pieces don't really get much use.
5,Ut Grandma,I really appreciate the quality of this line of doll house accessories. The grandkids will have fun playing house with all of these new items that will be added to their doll house.
5,great quality and lots of fun,My 6 year old daughter loves it. It is now well used in her doll house. Great quality and very nicely made
5,Doll House Accessories,Their doll house and these accessories are SO much more durable than the plastic ones that we played with when we were kids. And so realistic! Our 4 year old granddaughter plays with the set for hours at a time.
3,Great unit with problems but an excellent warranty.,"Purchase our proline espresso maker over a year ago and since then we have received three new ones. There have been many problems but KITCHENAID has been awesome. Read the warranty and they stand behind it. We have also purchased proline burr grinder and blender and soon waffle maker.We've not had any problems with any of our other proline equipment.The espresso is about as good as it gets for an under $2k boiler and yes we are pickly coffee bean snobs.Since we do not usually tollerate these kind of problems we addressed the ""how can you afford to do this"" question with kitchenaid and they have assured us the problems have been fixed with new models being shipped June 06.We would HIGHLY recommed these kitchaid products even though our espresso maker is dead waiting for our new one to arrive some time in June."
5,Happy Customer,"One of my friends had one of these Thermos bottles; fellow motorcycle rider, and he bought his specifically to carry water on the bike and keep it cold. After seeing it I ordered two of them (one for the bike, one for the car, plus qualified for free shipping) and after only two weeks I believe I have become emotionally involved with the thing. It keeps water super cold all day long, and I carry it with me everywhere. It will fit inside my purse, and it's not too heavy. I put water and ice in it in the morning, and then just add more water throughout the day. The bottle will still have ice at the end of the day. And I have found that I tend to drink more water than I did previously, because I have a supply of ice cold water always nearby. Great product, and I can't think of a single thing I would change about it. Well designed, works just as described."
5,best bottle made!,"I have had this hydration bottle for over a year and it is the best ever! Unfortunately, the plastic lip on the closure broke just before Christmas. An improvement would be to make the closure out of metal so that this would not happen. However, I like the bottle so well and am so lost without it, I am buying another."
1,It doesn't keep water hot,"Looking at all the great reviews, I thought this was a great product. But, I found that it doesn't keep things hot for even 1 hour. If you are looking for a flask to keep things hot, please buy something else."
2,Possible defect! Beware!,"I ordered mine on Sept. 2, 2010, and got it 2 days later, pronto. So good job, Amazon. This has been working great for the last 3 days. I would just press the button, pop it open, take a sip, and pop it back closed with one hand. Very handy. Yet, as I was on the computer, and taking a sip, my hands suddenly get wet. It turns out, a few other customers have received this too: the bottle was leaking. It was leaking at the site where you hold the bottle. The part where the rubbery part meets the bottle, was leaking water. I have not dropped it, nor refrigerated it. I shall have it returned or fixed! Don't get me wrong. This is still an amazing product. I'm just warning you all."
1,Leaked within the first week,"Got 3 of these thermoses and one of them started to leak within the first week. It leaked where the cap screws onto the thermos. I felt that if it leaked within the first week, the others were bound to leak as well - I ended up returning all 3 of them."
1,Would rate zero stars if I could,"I had this bottle for a little over a month. I loved it. Kept things cold, never sweated. And then the lid started leaking. Everywhere. Now the thing is useless. And, since it happened after 30 days, I cannot return it. Do not buy.FYI I almost never give a review this low. That is how much this thing stinks."
4,Great Product!!,"I really like this product, the only reason it didn't get the 5 stars is because it isn't large enough. It holds your standard size water bottles worth of water and keeps it cold for a long time, I just get through the water too fast."
4,Good quality bottle,"Great bottle. It's of high quality. Its easy to wash. The other bottle that I have has a lid that has many parts in it and I can't clean up with a brush some of the hidden parts. This one doesn't have any such thing. I mainly use it for keeping warm water for drinking. It stays warm for many hours but not long enough for me (I expected it to keep the water warm for 12 hours), May be I'm asking too much!"
3,You may not get the color you order,"This same item is available on Amazon for $5 less, but I paid more to get the ""Midnight Blue"". Instead I got a solid black one, which I already owned (and wanted two different colors so my kids could easily distinguish their own cups). Returning is a hassle and time waster, so now I'm stuck with it AND out five hard-earned bucks. The bottle is awesome, but Amazon's service for this item is definitely NOT. Just be sure you're not paying more than $16 for this or relying on a specific color ot be delivered."
5,good thermos,"Good insulation, right size of the bottle, good grip. Perfect drink bottle! I make fresh juices at home and need a bottle that would keep them fresh for a while. This thermos seems to do a good job at keeping my juices fresh. The taste of the juice doesn't change even after 6 hours of keeping it in the thermos."
5,Thermos Nissan 18-Ounce Bottle,"I purchased this particular bottle because it fits the water bottle pouch on my Harley-Davidson. It keeps ice all day in 100 degree temperature, even when I've refilled the bottle with water during the day. It's a great product."
5,Great Thermos to have on Hot Days,"I had initially purchased this thermos for myself because I LOVE ice cold water, and knowing it was made by Thermos, I knew anything they made was of great quality. To still have ice in my bottle at the end of the day, and living in 100+ degree temps, tells me this bottle was a keeper. My boys also have this thermos to take to school, and to have ice cold water after recess or when they're hot makes a huge difference in cooling them down and keeping them hydrated! Thanks, THERMOS!!"
2,Cold but leaky,We ordered this bottle because I already have a Thermos style water bottle that keeps my water cold all day. So does this one but water leaks out of the bottom of the cap when you drink from it! It is going to have to be returned.
2,It leaks....,"This is exactly what I wanted in a water bottle... But the first time I used it, I shook it up and noticed that little drops leak through the part where you twist it off..."
2,Great bottle until it started leaking,"My first disappointment was that this bottle must be hand washed, which was not mentioned in the product description. I suppose I should have guessed it based on the construction, but normally I try to avoid things that can't go into the dishwasher. Still, the size is perfect, and I love the pop-up drinking cap, plus my water stays cold, so other than being a little whiny about the extra dishwashing work, I've been very happy with this bottle for almost three months. That all changed today when my formerly favorite bottle suddenly started leaking all over the place. Thank goodness it was only filled with water. So given its short lifespan, I'm afraid I can't recommend it. Too bad."
4,Great at keeping things cold,This is amazing at keeping my water cold. I fill it with ice and pour in water. The ice lasts throughout my entire work day. It seems much smaller than 18 oz. I wish they made this in a bigger size.
4,Best water bottle to date -- and I've tried a few.,"After two weeks of using this bottle, I'd say it's well worth the price. I've used various steel, aluminum and plastic bottles from Sigg, Nalgene, Kleen Kanteen, Nathan, Camelbak, Gaiam and Nissan and think I've FINALLY the perfect water bottle. The lid is sanitary -- no exposure of the spout to outside elements (great for throwing in a gym bag), the grip is comfortable, and the bottle itself doesn't form condensation -- no water rings, no spills, no leaks (so far, anyway). Add to that if you throw in a few ice cubes in the morning, your water will still be cold 8 hours later. Amazing.UPDATE (Jan. 2013): I've now owned two of these bottles. Not because I love them THAT much (though I do), but because the lids DO break. Sure, the bottle itself is nearly indestructible, but the plastic lid isn't. I've search for replacement lids, but to no available. Seems a waste to have to discard the bottle just because the lid fails."
4,straw-free solution,"I bought this for my 8 yr old son's lunch. He loves it because you do not suck out through a straw, it's a free-flowing thumb size mouth once you pop the lid. Stainless steel inside, so it can be kept very clean. I do wish it wasn't quite so tall. It won't fit into most lunch boxes."
2,Started leaking immediately,"I bought this for my 12 yr old son to use this summer. It does work quite well for keeping stuff cold, but unfortunately it started leaking almost immediately."
4,Good Water Bottle with nice features,"This water bottle can keep water cold for over 12 hrs and has nice features: The pop up top has a locking strap that prevents it from inadvertently popping open. It holds enough water to satisfy most adults under normal circumstances. It has good seal and does not leak even when turned upside down while filled to capacity.The only thing I noticed is that there is some kind of metallic taste to the water and I am not sure what is causing it. I have washed the bottle with soapy warm water repeatedly to no avail. There is no carrying strap and so it must be carried in a lunch box unlike my previous Thermos Water Bottle. Nevertheless, this is functional water bottle."
5,Darn near perfect,"I love love love this bottle, I am particular to the all stainless version. Love the top, love the quality, love the way it keeps cold your water allllllllll day.The only drawback is no carry loop, so you loose use of one of your hands whilst out and about.I have ordered The affirm water bottle carrier that actually has a small pocket so now I will be compleat for every art show, beach excursion, or event. I can't wait to receive the carrier, my water bottle will then be perfect.I know, you may be thinking that's a lot of money to have tied up in water, but I have water with me every where I go, and really cold water is just the best so...... I find it to be a no brainer.Get it you won't be disappointed :)"
2,Seriously flawed,I'm a retired Infantryman so I understand how a product must stand up to the rigors of hard use. But I currently work in an office. I bought 2 of these. Within a month the blue rubber ring on the inside of the cap which keeps things sealed came loose and kept flopping out on both of them. You lose that ring and forget it. You won't have a seal. Then another month later the blue rubber cap that serves as a plug in the cap came loose and dissapeared. The thermos is useless without it. These are serious design flaws and I can't recommend them. I am sure the manufacturer is aware of these issues. They just don't want to fix them.
4,For cold drinks!,Great at keeping drinks cold. But the container does sweat. I thought this would be like a real double walled thermos. It seems to have a good seal on it so if you throw it in a bag shouldn't leak. But you have to be careful of when it sweats.
5,Perfect for all age groups except toddlers and infants,"Bit expensive, but worth every penny spent on it - perfect grip, stylish and above all keep the water cool. My 7 years old just love it. In fact, his water intake has increased because of it."
2,It Leaks,"I bought this for my 1st grader last year hoping that it would end our search for a leak-proof water bottle. Unfortunately, this thermos leaks and now is at the point where I need to throw it away (the klean kanteen classic screwtop and the REI insulated bottle with screwtop also leak). After going through countless brands over the past 2 years, I just ordered him an insulated camelbak with the bite valve. I purchased one for myself this summer and it has proven to be the best purchase of them all so far - it keeps water cold for a long time and does not leak. The only drawback is that the .5L is a bit heavy but there is a 12 oz version for little kids."
5,WOOOW !!!,Ice didn't melt in it while it's in the refrigerator for a whole day !!!No leaking whatever you do !.. Very nice quality .. RECOMMENDED !!
5,perfect! functional and practical,"I just love this. Highly recommended, i use it every day to carry hot tea to school and save so much money since i make my own. All of the other reviews pretty much say it all. BUY IT!!!!!!!!"
5,Stainless Steel Thermos 2465,I bought two of these because my brother had one during a recent motorcycle trip. I used and experienced it first hand on this trip. In spite of being in direct sunlight at nearly 100 degrees for 8-10 hours a day the thermos worked as advertised. The ice never melted in spite of the sweltering heat. It is excellent at keeping fluids cold and works well for hydration as you ride. The push button release and stem type fluid spout on the cap allows for one hand operation. I am hooked. May buy another one for my bicyle and another brother.Plywood
3,Only okay,"This thermos is decent but its pretty bulky to carry around and is not great for hot liquids. However, for cold drinks it is pretty good."
5,Ice all Day,"This water bottle is the best I have used. It will keep ice all day, seals tight, simple to use, and easy to clean. My only complaint is that it doesn't hold an extra 4 or 5 oz of water. The flip lid could get annoying to coworkers if you keep closing it and opening it (it clicks and pops), but it is easy to avoid the noise if you push in on the release button lightly while closing it, and catch the lid as it springs open. The Thermos is easy to drink out of and the lid stays nicely out of the way."
5,Happy Hydrator,"This is great little thermos. It's the perfect size for the car, easily fitting the cup holders without crowding. Living in ""the valley of the sun"" (Phoenix AZ metro area) I like to keep water in the car, but I don't like carrying it into and out of the office every day. I can fill this thermos with cool water in the morning, leave it in my parked car throughout the blistering hot day, and still have a welcome cool drink for the commute home. The design and finish are great and the size fits in the hand more comfortably than most insulated coffee mugs. The push-button flip-top works perfectly. It is rare that i can endorse a product without any reservation or hesitation. Try it, you'll like it!"
1,Won't fit anywhere,If you're planning to use this bottle on you bicycle you may want to think again. I have eight bicycles with water bottle cages. This bottle fits none of them. They will rattle and/or fall out on the ground. There is a rubber grommet but it is sorely misplaced. This bottle might have been designed with a bottle cage around. It could have been designed by someone who had paid attention to bicycles. Too bad.
5,Best water bottle,"I'm quite pleased with this Thermos bottle. I filled it with ice and water in the afternoon, left it in the car while I shopped, opened it a few times to take a drink. Then I forgot it in the car all night...and it was a warm night. The next afternoon the water inside was cold and still had a clump of ice in it! It's easy to drink from and it doesn't leak."
4,Great but not perfect.,"I've used this bottle for roughly two years and its succeeds in all the marketing claims. The single downside of this bottle is the durability of the lid. I dropped it about three feet onto a tiled floor and it landed lid first, shearing off a good chunk of it. It's unfortunate that the lid isn't partially metal to protect it from this fate.However, I purchased the identical product to replace it. Overall it's a great bottle, just be wary of lid damage."
5,I have 5 of these!,"I keep coffee in some and cold water in the others. I love the fact that I can lock them, and I love the little spout to drink from."
4,Just right 2/2,"Needed a Thermos to hold my juices and this one has done a good job with no complaints.I prepare about 40 ounces of juice everyday, This thermos holds one half of what I take to work with me, and I get 2 good sized cups out of it. Cleanup is a breeze using the spayer. I'm very satisfied."
5,thermos,it is great! keeps my water cold. i place ice in it then feel the rest with water and it will stay cold for over 24 hrs.
5,Water Bottle,"This is the best water bottle probably ever. It keeps water cool, plus it has a great design. I have bought 2 of these already because my husband uses it so much, and then loses it. Now we have to buy a 3rd. I wish he would stop losing it. :)"
5,Excellent thermos bottle,"Cool look, and convenient operation. It does what it should do, and it does well.Good price too.I will recommend this item to everyone."
5,Love this product!,"This Thermos hydration bottle is awesome! I just returned from a 2 week trip to Disney World and I carried it with me every day. The water stayed cold all day, despite the near 100 deg. temps. It was a lifesaver! It is easy to clean, not too heavy to carry and kept the water cool. I couldn't ask for better. It's well worth the price."
5,I love my water bottle,"I bought three of these water bottles for my family and must say we love our bottles. I drink water wherever I go and this bottle keeps my drink nice and cool. No leaks, no condensation, no funny taste or smell. Thanks Thermos!"
5,Best on the market,"I have had this Thermos for more than a year. I never leave home without it, but do leave it everywhere and always go back to get it. This is hands down the most useful thing that I have ever bought. It is good at what it's for and is virtually indestructible."
3,"It's ok, but Klean Kanteen is so much better","I bought theThermos insulated water bottle and a Klean Kanteen insulated water bottle. I love the Thermos lid and wish the Klean Kanteen had a similar system. I love the color and rubber grip on the Thermos as well. As for performance, Klean Kanteen has Thermos beat, hands down! I filled the Klean Kanteen bottle with ice water and sat through a softball game in 110 degree heat and still had ice at the end of the 3 1/2 hour game. I also took the Thermos bottle to the same game and the ice was gone after the first hour. The Thermos bottle just can't compete, performance wise. Though I'm sure the Thermos bottle would work just fine for people who don't live in the extreme heat of the southwest."
5,Great thermos,This is the only thermos that I have found that keeps drinks cold in Phoenix in the summer. I keep it in the car and my drink is still cold when I get back hours later.
5,very good,"very good , buy it , i love it, i am french don' t write very good English , but you can but it , you hare happy"
5,Works great,Keeps water SUPER COOL and even hot (although not designed for it). No leak. The bottle itself is a bit bulky though.
4,LOVE IT NOT BIG ENOUGH,"Love my new thermos keeps my water very cold, easy to drink from, WISHIt Was Bigger, does not hold enough water."
1,Dents easily.,"All of the positive sides mentioned in other reviews, no need to repeat those.However this thing gets dented too easily. Since Thermos company is making lots of money by having this made in China (A DOLLAR A BOTTLE at most), they could at least make sure the Chinese used better quality (18/10), thicker stainless steel."
2,Regret buying this.,"I previously had a slightly larger model that did not have the flip top cap, but unfortunately I lost it during a wedding event.The last model was a bit too big, so I ordered this 18oz model instead. Whether it had a flip top wasn't really relevant for me, but for some reason it was cheaper than the non flip top at the time, so that's why I bought it.After a couple weeks, it developed a leak, where liquid would drain from out of bottom of the cap, through the threads in the metal that hold the entire cap on. I could not fix it, in fact it was very perplexing, as I'm not sure how it's leaking at all. But it is, and since I can't fix it, it's now useless.2/5 Because it did work, but now doesn't."
2,NOT 4 HOT,"If you are thinking about this item for your morning coffee - for get about it.In passing the description says in small type Cold, but also states keeps liquids at maximum temperature.When I think of Thermos Brand products it includes holding things that are Hot or Cold.For cold drinks it appears to be a great product just don't use it for hoy drinks.Every time I tried to take a sip of hot coffee I burned my tongue.Fortunately I purchased on Amazon so it goes back for a full refund. Thanks Amazon"
3,Good but not great for keeping water hot,"It's a very good product, the only minuses are that it does not keep water hot for very long (just a couple of hours) and the hinge that unlocks the cap sometimes fails to pop open so you have to force it."
2,Leaks,I like the look and feel of the bottle. Overall I was pleased except when I shook it and it leaked. I tried it several times and it did have a drip. It can be a problem it it drips on your cloths or inside your car. Would not buy it again.
2,Good but not durable,I bought this thermos to store warm water for my infant. It worked fine for 2 -3 months and now I noticed that it has leakage problem. Water has started leaking from the joint in the thermos. There are no cracks and the thermos never fell anywhere. So don't expect durability for your money...I am searching for a better one now...
5,Worth for the money,Good product.. Finally settled with this after buying 5 / 6 other brands..Easy to clean.. Good for 5 - 6 hours with both hot and cold drinks..
5,"Hands down, one of the best water bottles","This is fairly expensive, but I am very please with the quality of the product. Previously, I had been buying plastic bottles every few months, until the it got too dirty and started making the water taste bad.With this bottle, I find myself drinking more water.Pros:- Stainless steel(BPA fee), so water taste good and doesn't pick up residues- Insulated, so no wet messes on your desk & papers due to condensation- Nice cap design, I like the way the lid closes and seals the bottle from the outside. It's really easy to open close- Mouth piece, very easy to drink from, so no spill and you get plenty of water, so no sipping like Dasani bottlesCons:- The only one I could think of is the opening is kind of small to it can be hard to put ice in there if you have large pieces of ice or you are trying to fill the ice from an ice machine. But, that is being really picky."
4,Great Thermos - if the seal stays in place,UPDATE - After reading some other reviews I contacted the complany letting them know the seal broke off. They asked for my mailing address and a week later i recieved all new seals. Hopefully these seals will last longer than the first set but impressed that they actually sent out new seals.This lasted 2 months and then the seal broke off and won't stay on. Now it leaks constantly! I can't use it anymore and i can't find anymore seals. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
3,poor spring loaded lid,"We have purchased 3 of these. The spring loaded lid doesn't work in 2 out three.I we lived in US, I would have sent them back, but it would cost too much to sent it backfrom Aus."
1,Designed to fail,The good news is these are the best water bottles on the market. The bad news is that in short time the O-ring seals and spring loaded tops will fail and you will not be able to get replacement parts. You will have to take these expensive stainless steel bottles and throw them in a landfill and buy all new ones. Planned obsolescence.
2,Not as good as other Thermos Products,"I thought this would insulate as well as some of the other thermos bottles I have had. Sadly, it does not. It is pretty skinny and can fit in the side pocket of a lot of bags, a feature that my other thermos bottle does not have. The top and lid clip work well and the bottle feels good in the hand. However, it only keeps ice cool for about 6-8 hours. Sadly, that's sub par for me. I like it but don't love it."
5,Great Buy,I love my Thermos. I carry it to the gym when I workout and then I carry it with me the rest of the day. It keeps my drinks cool and secure all day. It is one of the best purchases I have ever made.
3,Rubber drink stopper gets moldy,Loved this thermos until it developed black mold on the blue rubber stopper where you drink. I was unable to get the mold out. Even tried bleach and scrapping with a brush and sharp edge. No getting that out.
4,"Thermos 18-Ounce Stainless-Steel Hydration Bottle, Charcoal","Great item for those hot days. Keeps my water cold and easy one hand operation. Only thing is that my item has been scracted already during daily use. Other than that, I would'nt go anywhere without it. It's nice that I can get a water refill anywhere for free. Just need a holder for this so I can keep both hands free now. Thanks Thermos and Amazon.com."
2,good until gasket goes missing,"This themos worked well for a while and then it started leaking. Near as I can tell, there must have been a gasket inside the screw top that fell out."
1,dont risk,"first i'd like to say that i hate 1 star reviews and people who nag about crap that isnt related to the functionality of the item...I bought this item because of all the good reviews it received and didnt believe the 1 star reviews that said it leaks, but sure enough it started leaking on me a few days ago. for almost $20 you think they might sell a bottle that wont have an issue that defeats its purpose... you cant return it for a full refund after the first month"
1,THIS BOTTLE LEAKS FROM THE BOTTLE NECK,"I bought this bottle for my wife who's pregnant. I was so glad in the first place after reading all positive reviews. She always use it for her cold soy milk and coconut juice. Two days ago she filled the bottle with orange juice and the bottle leaks from the bottle neck. She thought she put the orange juice too much, so she drank it until 1/2 bottle. After 1 minute, we noticed it's still leaking from the bottle neck; moreover, the bottom part is leaking too. Since then, this bottle keeps leaking from the neck. I'm not sure whether I received the defective unit or not, but I'm not recommending this after 45 days of use."
2,Loved it... while it worked.,"I've had this waterbottle for a few months, and it was fantastic while it worked. The insulation is everything you could hope for, and I loved the design of the top--1 handed operation, yet not annoying to drink from like some bottles.But then the seal failed, and now it leaks. Everywhere. Constantly."
5,Great product,"This is my 2nd bottle. The 1st lasted 3-4 years when the plastic top finally cracked. Since we are water drinkers, we have saved thousands of plastic bottles. We fill it with ice from ice maker inthe frig, then top off with the cold filtered water, last all day."
5,great bottles,"Some of the best bottles we've had for water while working outside. Easy to grip, easy to clean and the latch on top keeps dirt from garden from getting into your water."
5,Very Happy with this Thermos,"I am happy with this thermos. I purchased it to transport green smoothies from home to work. I've been careful thus far to not tip the thermos - I always travel with it upright - and I have had no problems with leaks. I haven't tried to keep anything cold, that's not what I bought it for. I am currently looking to purchase a bigger version of this same thermos, because 18 ounces is too small for my needs."
4,Thermos Nissan Water Bottle,"This water bottle is exactly what I needed. It is a great size (bigger than most plastic bottles of water), it really keeps your water cold all day (as long as you put it in there cold to begin with). It has a cool little spout to drink out of, it is easy to clean and overall a great purchase. Another great product by Thermos!"
5,Love it!,"I've used this water bottle for two years and it works as well as day one. I've dropped the bottle numerous times and the top is cracked quite badly, but it still holds water and never looses a drop. I can latch the lock, toss it on the seat of my car and never worry that it will leak. I love it and carry it with me everywhere. Fits in all my cars' cup holders as well...another huge benefit. Plus, being double wall insulated, there is no condensation on the outside of the water bottle. Keeps water cold all day, even without using ice. I don't have a single bad thing to say about it! Buy it without worry...you'll love it too!"
5,Works as advertised!,"I purchased several Thermos/Nissan can coolers several years ago which I loved so I decided to stick with vacuum insulation for my water bottle. These things are worth every penny as they keep things hot or cold for hours! In Arizona, it's nice to get into your 120-degree car and have an ice-cold drink waiting for you. I was dubious about the design, but it is almost perfect. I do miss the rubber bottom that the can coolers have, but otherwise, I have no complaints."
4,Great,"This is an awesome bottle, just a few small issues.Pros- Keeps stuff cold for hours (less than advertised 12 but still impressive)- The pop up cap is great, very easy and quick to use .. perfect for one-handed operation- PriceCons- There could have been be much plastic/rubber used.- Bottle appears a bit bulky for an 18oz, I've seen smaller bottles at same capacity- The locking mechanism is a little flimsy, not sure how long it would lastThis is an awesome bottle, well designed and a great bargain."
4,Great product!,"I really like this product, works great keeping my water cold during the day at work. It has a wide enough opening for the water to come out, allowing for ease of drinking."
4,As Pictured???,"I love this style of Thermos but I wanted the brown that was pictured. A true brown with a kind of dull finish. What I received from Amazon.com, which I usually trust, was a high gloss redish brown. Like I said I love this style so I will keep it but I really hate false advertisement in any form whether it is the description or what is pictured. I really am disappointed in Amazon.com."
1,It leaked...,"It worked fine for the first few weeks, and then the bottle started to leak a big time. I had to return it for a refund. It was not a good experience to have my purse flooded with tea."
4,A great weekend read,"Just finished How Town. I enjoyed it and recommend it. The only criticism of the book is that I never felt satisfied about two things: 1) Why on earth did he take this case? At every turn the defendant, defendants wife, sister, police, DA,etc were on his back. Nava should have better articulated what was motivating Rios to take this case because I never got why he felt obliged to. Giving Rios a stronger motivation would have at least left me feeling content with the characterization. 2)I think Nava could have challenged the 'pedophilia is a harmless sexual orientation' rationalization shown by the defendant a little more than he did. In particular, with his dramatic ending there was a golden opportunity for a showdown with Mr. Windsor saying - look at what pedophilia has done to all these lives. It ain't pretty."
2,plus sound?,I found the vendor to be quite helpful and they followed up on my problem.The device I bought was not very well engineered and did not meet my needs.the problem of return and refund were not worth the trouble. No problem with the vendor and I'm sure better designed products would work.
1,disappointed,"ear pieces too small to stay in place[head set would be better]. any movement causes static that drowns out sound.Because of these problems ,this product was a waste of money."
1,more leftist propaganda,"this book is exactly what you would expect of a left-wing self appointed intellectual. the book paints a picture of capitalism as an evil force out to destroy the world. to do so, the author uses the typical scare tactics, half-truths, lies, misquoted authors and thinkers, and his own bizarre facts and fallacies. in doing so, this guy tries to act original, and wants us to think that he has his own ideas, but in attempting to do so just sounds like he's talking down to us common dumb people in true al gore fashion. of particular note is his insistance that mercantilism and capitalism are the same economic system, which is simply stupid."
2,Binding not tight on this edition,"My review is of the particular edition of this great book, not the book itself, which I highly recommend. This particluar edition is cheaply made. Pages have fallen out. I would go with another publisher."
3,book is good for reading,The book for reading is good but the quality of production is very poor. The book is falling apart with pages falling out constantly.
5,Free to Be book is great!,Great product and I'm so glad I could purchase it through Amazon. Will make a great holiday present! Thanks for the speedy delivery and great quality!
5,"Excellent book for ""Tweens""","I ordered this book for my 10 year old grandaughter after seeing Marlow Thomas on the Today show discussing it. It is absolutely wonderful. It discusses many things that seem to be problems in that age group...e.g. brothers and sisters, mean kids, divorce, and so on. All in a very understandable format.I'm giving this to my grandaughther for Christmas and I know she will love it."
1,This book will strip girls of a precious gift.,Being influenced by this book at an early age robbed me of being distinctly feminine. Boys and girls are different and to deny that is ignorant.
4,countering negative messages about gender expectations,"This is a kids' collection of songs, poems, and stories about being your own person and not having your options determined by gender. There are some great messages. I really like some of the pieces, and particularly ""Parents Are People"", about jobs mommies and daddies can have. However, having just reread the book and heard the CD as an adult, I can see why my parents didn't get it for me as a kid. Some of the pieces heavily imply a strong cultural pressure to conform to gender. While this is often true, some parents may choose not to harp on it, or introduce it earlier than the kid finds it out on their own. And, thank goodness, it's less true than it was when Marlo Thomas put the collection together, for which we can give Marlo her portion of the credit. :)"
3,Only 4 songs,"I just bought this for my niece and was very disappointed to find it only had 4 songs on the CD, even though the book seems to have all of the songs from the original album. Now I have to buy or copy the songs for her so she'll know what the book is about."
3,Nicely written for first time author,"Initially ""The Making of Poldark"" was to be completed by a ghostwriter. Robin Ellis undertakes the task of writing the book himself. Written in a flowing conversational style with insights into Cornwall and the actor's life. This is a great read for any fan of the original Poldark series. Ellis manages to make himself disappear into the background whilst describing in acute details how the original series was filmed. Beautiful pictures add to the book's appeal."
1,"Making ""Poldark""","Disappointment. I didn't know Mr. Ellis had written about his ""Poldark"" experience and was very excited to find his book on Amazon. The book is short and not interesting to read."
1,Don't buy it.,Don't buy it. It is not a software. It is a subscription.You will have to host the web pages only at their website and you must pay $14.99 per month for that.
5,If only I had found this item sooner...,"Update, Jan 7 2009This product has failed because the zipper will no longer stay zipped- it peels open as soon as I zip it closed. Now, instead of a storage bag, it's a storage sling.Finally- something to keep my drawbar, pin and lock organized; keep all this stuff from sliding around in the back of the truck and keep their dirt off everything else. Only time will tell, but the material and zipper seem tough enough to last."
1,Another Distorted View of Islam,"This book is another attempt by those who do not grasp the internal meanings of Islam to critique its outer form. If you really want to understand what Islam is about, take it from renouned scholars of Islam, not those who cannot even read the Quran in Arabic. The core of Islam is very beautiful and this book fails to convey this."
1,Inside Islam: A Guide for Catholics,"I find this book is based on fear and confrontation. As Catholics, we embrace all that is good and true in other religions. I'd like to see a book that highlights this while in charity acknowledging that we do see some things different as far as our understanding of Jesus' divinity and the notion of God as trinity. Still, we share a common desire to work for human dignity, social justice and the common good. Both Christians and Muslims have fallen short of this common goal in the past. Let's stop trying to prove ourselves right and admit that we've both made mistakes. let's seek greater understanding and build on the common ground we have and work for mutual respect."
5,A big step for this up and coming band,"after their two previous full releases the BLOOD BROTHERS have really taken a step up. this album is sheer and utter controlled chaos! With a song that almost starts as a ballad (the salesmen denvermax) that then Shatters it's beautiful intro with the howls of it's two lead singers, wailing and earshredding guitars, pulsing and driving bass and synthesizers and complex drums. you should really check this band out. and they are incredible live. find a way to hear them ASAP!"
4,a bit of a departure,"A lot of people are not pleased with the direction the Blood Brothers took on this one. I guess they ""sold out"" or whatever. Having Ross Robinson produce their record could not have helped. Also there is more melody on this one, more actual singing instead of just yelling. That makes their music less angular, for better or worse. My opinion is that the tweaking of the formula worked, and I enjoy Burn Piano Island, Burn more than their previous records. The one dude still mutters and shouts, the other still squeaks and drawls, sounding like the singer of Tesla on uppers with his crotch pinched. The sound is crystal clear. Despite being the producer of bands so horrible I will not name them here, Robinson did nothing to hinder the music.One more thing: the cover art totally smokes. Whoever did it deserves a pat on the back."
1,music? try noise.,i actually like some screamo music. i dont mind it at all actually. but this band just seems so bad its unbelievable. but believe it. i dont know how anyone can actually listen to this without their heads exploding or wanting to gnaw of their limbs.they play everything so sporadically it doesnt even flow together. its just a bunch of sounds conjumbled together to make one mess.double the pleasure double the fun? i dont think so. the fact that there is two of them makes it that much more annoying. the two singers sound like they are 10 year old girls being murdered throughout every song.dont waste your time buying this album. you will end up using it for a decorative coffee coaster.
1,pure garbage,"what can you say? it's barely listenable...you call that a lead vocal? it's nothing but screaming...pure, unadulterated noise....garbage. hopefully, the 5-star reviewers will eventually get beyond this period in their musical exploration!"
4,Best Rock CD of This Year,"This CD marks a drastic evolution previously hinted at in the Blood Brother's earlier works. Here we see them finally finding a consistently powerful and unique voice. This album is brilliant, marred only by the semi-filler God Bless You Blood Thirst Zeppelins! that keeps it from a 5. However, this is easily the best rock CD to be released this year, towering above its peers in its creativity, cohesiveness, complexity (finally in lyrics as well as musicianship), and immediacy. You'll near nothing else like it this year, very highly recommended."
3,A roiling blast of hock and awe,"Like twins afflicted with Tourettes, the two singers who front The Blood Brothers deliver a roiling blast of hock and awe. Listeners must strain to both hear and interpret the ensuing torrent of words, often unintelligible, but both surreal and oddly poetic. In small doses, ""Burn Piano Island, Burn"" has cathartic properties, purging the mind of day-to-day cares, but a full dose of this fury likely would induce a crippling cluster headache. Somehow the band manages to forge an energized soundscape that alternately absorbs and deflects the shrieks, yelps, and other utterances that stream forth.In short, a manic excursion fueled by frenzy that will elicit immediate, visceral reactions from most folks. Yet for all the unbridled wildness, one ends up wondering if these guys will ever harness their potential and approach the gutsy energy of Roger Chapman when he belts out Daddy Rolling Stone on the Streetwalker's ""Red Card."""
5,Great product,"Its a great product, it looks really nice on my table, i hate round dishes ,just what i was looking for, light, nice , anyway i recomend it, thanks."
4,"Basic, elegent and convenient.","I wanted Corelle because I was tired of my old, tacky, heavy, hand-me-down stoneware I'd been using for years. Unfortunately there isn't a single pattern available now that I like. I was hoping to find the discontinued ""Tribal Spirit"" design but alas no one is giving up theirs so plain white will have to do.As noted the cups aren't Corelle (they are Corelle brand) and are a shade off. The color difference doesn't bother me in the slightest. It makes it look less like I got ""Dinnerware in a Box"""
3,good~,"I'm very satisfied this size of dishes and bowls.But Mug color is some different from the others, that is not pure white but little milky white.Though I know the mug is not corelle but they didn't say about different color..."
5,Simply perfect.,"Okay, so I picked these up at Meijer, not Amazon. But hey, they're actually coming from Target and the seller isn't what the review is really about anyway.I absolutely love these dishes. Corelle has been around forever and there's a good reason for it. The quality is excellent. They're very durable and I haven't had a scratch or chip yet. Not only that, the simplicity of the design offers versatility. You can serve burgers & fries in a hurry or, host a dinner party with a 4 course meal and the presentation is fantastic either way. I live with my hubby and my 6 year old son...Many times while setting the table, I could be caught wishing that I had something NICE that could also stand up to 'man'handling withOUT having to pay an arm & a leg for it. Now I do. Hooray! Give these a try...you won't be disappointed."
5,Great,"Bought these plates for a girlfriend and she is very happy with them. Corelle should produce more modern designs, such as this one."
4,Perfect,I love these dishes. They are simple and easy to clean and very durable. They have been dropped on my granite and I have had no trouble. I just wish the cups were made from the same material as the dishes.
5,Love Them,"They wash really well in my dishwasher with very minimal prewash\rinsing. They were on sale for $31.99 when I bought four sets, so watch for price breaks on this set. Simple, elegant, child friendly, and light weight. I love them. Highly recommended. So far, one plate was defective and manufaturer is sending me a new one, no hassles."
2,You need to know Mugs are NOT Corelle!,"I was very disappointed that the square mugs were NOT Corelle! I did not see this disclosed anywhere in the details of the ""set"" when ordering. They were ordered for my mother who isn't able to lift anything heavy thus the disappointment as these mugs are made of heavy porcelin and breakable. The dishes are great, just what we wanted, made in the USA....mugs are made in China! Very disappointed and wish Corelle made a matching mug so I could exchange these."
5,Corelle is really nice!,"Corelle is SO durable! And so space-saving! This was for a gift. I have an older set of Corelle, but I am tired of the pattern so I'm looking for another pattern that I will like for a long time...."
4,Great Plates,"We started using these plates as soon as they arrived. We love the plates and bowls, but not the cups. The cups are not made of the same material as the plates and bowls. The cups are made of ceramic which can chip and break. We are using those as decor. For the price, its a great deal and they look really good especially with something yummy one them."
4,Great product,"Durable, affordable, looks good, made in USA (except mugs made in China). I had to take off one star because the plates are slightly ""wavy"". It's only noticeable when the plates are stacked, then you can see uneven spaces between plates. It doesn't bother me, but some people may not like it."
4,Corelle square 16-piece dinnerware set.,"Just what we needed. Something light-weight and durable. The dinner plates are quite large; lunch plate almost big enough to be used as dinner plate. Simple, clean lines."
3,"Must be ""seconds.""","Some of the plates do not stack exactly right. I think these must be ""seconds"" or perhaps current manufacturers of Corelle does not have good quality control. Too much trouble to return and I like the product generally. But be advised regards quality of current dishes."
4,Fits great in cabinet,"These dishes fit wonderfully in the cabinet. Bought for an RV, worked great. Not particularly breakable (you have to try hard)."
2,Do not purchase,"I would definitely not recommend this product. The plates are very thin and feel like they could crumble in your hands let alone survive a run in the dishwasher. I found a set of dishes at Walmart that are a lot more modern looking, that are heavy, can be put in the oven at a low temp, chip resistant, and microwave safe. For the same price as well as for the same amount of dishes. Do not get..[...]"
4,Corelle dinnerware,Product is great. Packing inadequate in box with only 1 strip of bubble wrap around edges. Plates were broken and had to be returned.
1,Counterfeit or just terrible,"I got the set the other day after scoping out the set on the Company's website and doing general research. Almost all reviews I saw was impressed with Corelle, but when I got the set in the mail the bowls and dinnerplates said ""made in the USA"" while the cups (in a completely different material and a different white color) said ""made in China"". We will return immediately!! This is either counterfeit or just awful, awful production."
5,Love it,"I love Corelle. It can be slightly abused without a problem. After years of ceramic plates that, if accidentally brushed against another, chipped, Corelle is a welcome sign. It is microwave and oven safe, though be careful: in the past I left a plate in the microwave after it was done cooking for about 30 seconds. The plate EXPLODED into thousands of little pieces all over the inside of the microwave. I had owned that plate for two years. I contacted Corelle just to ask them if that was a typical problem and no questions asked they sent me a new one. GREAT customer service."
1,color,the color of the mugs does not match the colors of the plates. mugs are beige not white. very disappointing.
3,Cups not Pure White,"While I love the set...the plates are Pure White, but the cups are not. The cups are an off-white. Not an exact match."
2,Colrelle 16-piece Dinnerware Set,Cups were not made out of Corelle material. They were made out of thick cheap porcelain and they were made in China but the plates were from Corelle material and they were made in USA.
1,Corelle Dishes are not supposed to break BUT they do!,"I hadn't had Corelle dinnerware for 20 years. I remembered how much I loved it when I had it and how indestructible it was. So I bought the new White Square pattern enough for 20 place settings. By the second week one dinner plate broke in the dishwasher. Then another one broke simply setting it on the table with food on it. So I called and ordered another place setting for 4. That arrived with a bowl and a dinner plate broken. I am still waiting (a month now) for replacements for the so called ""unbreakable Corelle"". Even if there is a guarantee, trying to get any item replaced is difficult. I wouldn't recommend Corelle dinnerware anymore. I am a very unhappy customer."
3,"Nice Style, but not that great of a dish",I really like the style of these dishes and that is it. I haven't had the dishes for two months and I am already looking for new dishes. The dishes stick together when their placed on top of each other and stain really easily. I just feel like their not a high quality. I read other peoples reviews and thought I would be getting a good set of dishes and now I wish I could return them.
2,Shipping problems,"Unfortunately, I received my order in an extremely crushed box that was clearly not marked ""fragile, handle with care, etc."" It was just marked heavy. When I opened the shipping box, I found the Corelle box crushed on one side, looking like an accordian. This was a shower gift, so I was extremely upset. By some miracle, not one piece of Corelle was chipped or broken and I was short on time, so I had to find another box to re-wrap all of the pieces and give the gift in another box, advising the bride to be that, ""I didn't buy the set at a yardsale"". I really can't say that I would purchase anything from Amazon again that is breakable or fragile because between Amazon's negligence in not marking the shipping box appropriately and UPS's horrible negligence in kicking around the box prior to delivery."
2,HITACHI PF2U,Low quality mechanical components (had to take the first one back after a month). Fair picture quality and speed. Annoying hi-pitched sound imminates while running DVDs after 1-2months of use. Overall this product really lowered my opinion of Hitachi.
1,Pingu the Snowboarder,This DVD does not play on any type of DVD player. I have 3 different types and also asked other people to try it on thiers. I have been trying to return it for weeks now and got no reply. Not a happy with this at all.
4,The first book of a great trilogy.,"A post-apocalyptic heavy duty entertainer. What a great read. Great characterization, thought provoking story and best of all....soooo entertaining. Must read. And then get ready to follow-up with Wanderer and Witch. Buy them all at once, you won't be disappointed. What a great trilogy! Hoo-Rah."
1,Haven't even read it after dealing with the first,"I can't rate this item that well, because as I said in the tittle of my review, I haven't even read it, but after trying to read the first one, which I couldn't end because it was way to America-flavored, and the plot was as boring as the characters. Or at least it was to me.I'm sorry to rate this book so badly, specially since I haven't even wanted to read it after the fiasco of the frst one, but I couldn't get into the first book, so go figures for the second."
3,3.5 Star Rating,"Like the first book in the series, I found this to be Ok but not great and not a keeper for the bookshelf. I liked it a little more than the first. Hence I give it a 3.5 star rating compared to my 3 star rating for the 1st book. The idea of U.S. intelligence agencies recruiting vampires to fight terrorism in a post-9/11 world is an intriguing storyline and has a lot of potential. However, the author is failing to deliver. But it's not the worst vampire fiction book our there. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. SPOILER AHEAD: I didn't enjoy the ending, especially Darius' departure and that Babba dies. I can't quite explain it but I lost interest in the book and I don't think I will continue the series."
2,Major Cliches,"If you like vampire cliches, you'll love this book. Vampires who become bats and sleep in coffins with a layer of Transylvanian dirt. At least we didn't get that they don't have reflections and cannot eat or drink anything but blood. I found it almost impossible to get into the story because when the plot became moderately interesting, one or more of Team Darkwing stripped and flew off into the night. It's a shame that Russe relies on stuff that requires little imagination because in spite of my criticisms, I think she has talent as a writer. Maybe she'll write something other than the Darkwing Chronicles."
5,Superb Latin Jazz played by Japanese stars,This ensamble of Japanese musicians playing superb Latin Jazz is headed by Akira Jimbo (ex-Casiopea drummer) and maestro saxophonist Sadao Watanabe. What a superb big band these guys have out together.Tracks (not available at this Amazon page):1. Machete2. Orange Express3. El Futuro4. Casa Verde5. Cosa Latina6. Besame Mucho7. Mambeo Mareo8. Quien Sera9. Tu Pintura10. Almost There11. Moliendo Cafe (Bonus Track)
5,"kept my attention, also very well written w/ the history, caused me to want to read the next book.","Enjoyed the history and also kept my intrests, looking forward to reading the next book Hartford.Thank you Angelafor another interesting series."
1,crap!!!,"I must completely agree with that other reviewer. I downloaded this set instead of buying it, so I am glad I didn't waste my money. This is so bad... I don't know why this even was released. I would much prefer sticking to Autry's Columbia works and his studio recordings instead of this disappointment. I'm not very happy with the TV collections that have been made available on Autry as I wish this company would reissue all his studio recordings like with Bear did on his early works."
1,THE worst book I have ever read,"I estimate that I have read about 2000 books in my life, and I would rate this as the worst! The basic principle is that to be at your best, you have to abandon the things that you need to do, like go to work and take care of your home so that you can ""get into the zone."" This happens when you enter some sort of ""energy spectrum"" which aligns some sort of magnetic fields. I bought this book because it's title seems to indicate a scientific element to self help. I am a physicist and found that intriguing. Don't be fooled like I was. The author tries to use scientific words to substantiate spooky, ridiculous ideas. WOW, this was bad!"
5,This book is fabulous,"As an attorney, I am trained to strategize, analyze, and judge in order to achieve a certain result. This book offers a new way of reaching your goals. I have followed Ms. Anderson's suggestions for alternative energetic ""choices"" and have been amazed by the results. This book is easy to read, practical and filled with wisdom on each page. I highly recommend it!"
2,Playing the Quantum Field : How Changing Your Choices Can Change Your Life,"This book turned out be something different than what I expected. I was expecting something deeper but the book reads more like an autobiography of the author. With the word Quantum in the title, I thought the book would be more scientfically oriented towards Quantum Physics which is a main interest of mine. The book is very basic which I think would be good for someone new to this type of subject matter, but I was hoping for something more advanced. I am encouraged though by the book. I am impressed that someone can take her life experiences and write a book that could be of help to others. I have a similar passion for sharing my experiences and learnings with others. This book gives me hope that I can indeed help others on a larger scale than maybe I had originally thought."
4,Replacement Bit.,Good Bit. Needed a replacement bit for hinge and lock set work. This does the job. Good bit for the money.
4,"good book, not so great for the younger science set","I actually thought this was a DVD - so, I was shocked when it arrived and was a book! That my completely my fault for looking at DVDs so much that I overlooked the word ""paperback"". But, I'll keep it for our children when they are older, for sure.Not a lot of pictures, no color, and so it's definitely a book for the parents to do stuff with bit older kids.Book was in good shape and promptly delivered. :0)"
4,Nice Aroma,This smells really nice and makes my skin soft and moisturized. It is a creamy oil that doesn't leave a high shine. Its all natural too. I use it on my skin and in my hair. It moisturizes my hair without making it greasy.
3,Only for hot climates?,"Amazing smell, this was exactly what Id hoped for. Smells just like the Nars Monoi oil only without the Nars pricetag! Only drawback is that the day after I had opened it, the oil had solidified and is now permanantly solid. I can still use it but doesnt look like an oil anymore. I live in LA so its not that cold here but perhaps it was meant for a more tropical climate."
4,Sir Hugh Corbett Triumphs Again,"The book begins with Alexander III of Scotland riding out from Ediburgh Castle to be with his new bride who is waiting for him at Kinghorn Manor. It is a filthy stormy night and the following day the King is found below the cliff with his neck broken and his horse close by. It is assumed that the horse lost its footing and took them both over the cliff.Hugh Corbett is sent to Scotland to find out whether it was truly an accident, or something far more sinister.Corbett is drawn into the intrigues of the Scottish court and faces intrigue, suspicion and danger before a conclusion is reached.Doherty is one of my favourite author's and he never lets the reader down."
4,Was it change for the sake of change?,"The Virgin in the Ice is one the the many Ellis Peters books that I have read and enjoyed over the last twelve+ years. Why then, when there is a more than adequate story line, and very clear descriptions of the characters, do the film writers have to alter details. Surely there was no need to distort the details to such an extent that Brother Oswin, who had nothing to do with the disappearance of Yves and Ermina Hugonin in the book, should suddenly be so closely involved? Or is it just that the script writers could not make the plot fit any better? Why also is the Hugh Beringar of this film so unlike his description in the books - tall, solid and fair rather than slight and dark? Perhaps I'm being picky but why change for the sake of change?"
2,Better than no video at all...,"I suppose you get what you pay for, but in some cases (like here), even that's not the case. This video was filmed using a crappy helmet cam and you could probably find better rides with better video on Youtube. This could have been a really cool concept, but some dude throwing his weekend ride video up with a couple of effort screen titles thrown in is not really worth the money."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!,COULD NOT RATE LOWER THAN ONE STAR! False advertising at Amazon.com for this CD-R. It is a burn of MP3 files and not a real CD. Not authorized by the label and absolutely no liner notes. They don't tell you what it is and this practice is just SO WRONG on several labels. Don't buy this or any other disc on demand.
2,Ok,"I grew up loving the ""Meatballs"" series and other 80s teen-camp movies. But I didn't go through adolescence in the 80s. And thats where most of the humor comes from in this overrated movie.Its not dull or totally unfunny. But no moment warrants anything better than a smile. Horny Jewish kids at a camp. Most of the characters and storylines aren't that funny. And the actors playing them add most of the life to the movie. The only reasons to watch this movie are the funny characters who are in the background. David Hyde Pierce, the one-note funny of Paul Rudd, Amy Poehler and Christopher Meloni all play funny cliche bit parts, usually found in other camp movies. But its the unfunny original characters who get the most screen time. Garofalo, Showalter and the rest are just boring and unlikable. And I'm sure they can be funny in other roles.Watch it once. You won't remember much because its not a great comedy. Not even that good."
5,Arts and Farts and Crafts!!,"This movie rocks hard. Early 80's camp-movie satire hard. Maybe more of a homage. From the same guys behind The State, Reno 911, and Stella. It's more of a series of similarly-themed sketches than a real plot - but very funny. You don't have to have gone to a Jewish summer camp as a kid, but it doesn't hurt."
5,Great,"This is a great movie. I saw that some people didn't agree and had to set the matter straight. Very funny. You probably have to be of a certain generation, or at least be down with a certain sort of off-the-wall, postmodern humor...but I would suspect in general that Gen Xers with a good sense of humor will LOVE this movie. I did, and so did everyone I know. Pure fun, and extremely clever humor. Brilliant even. (I had to check my memory to confirm that it warrants this - and yes, there are at least a few jokes in there that are positively brilliant, in both conception and execution.)I saw this movie when it was in the theater, and now that it's out on DVD, I am going to buy it. So there."
1,Just plain dumb,"With this cast, I was expecting a much better movie but it was very sophomoric and stupid (not even funny and no plot). What a waste of talent. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
4,You will love it or hate it,"There's no middle ground with Wet Hot American Summer. Either you will dimiss it as garbage, or you will love it and watch it repeatedly. I liked it, and upon subsequent viewings I caught more and more of the parody.The movie is a parody of 80's 'teen-exploitation' movies like Meatballs and the like. If you aren't familiar with such comedies, very could well miss the humor in Wet Hot American Summer.For fans of Christopher Meloni (Law & Order SVU, Oz), this is a good chance to see him take on a comedic role that you don't usually get to see."
4,"If You Like Silly, You'll Like This","This is a silly movie, thrown together, filled to the brim with comedic bits. Some of it will work for you, some will go flat, and the parts that work are different for different people. (My favorite bit is Paul Rudd's ridiculous pout at having to clean up a mess. No kidding.) But there's plenty to laugh at, and it's very entertaining seeing so many really big stars (now: I assume most were minor players at the time) all thrown together in such a B-grade movie. This doesn't have the 5-star polish of the truly classic silly movies, like ""Airplane!"" or ""Animal House"". But it's well worth your time."
3,"I enjoyed it, but it's okay at best.","Anyone who would give a movie like this 5 stars obviously hasn't seen very many movies. I doubt that any of the major actors in the film would think of giving it that high of a score. It's making fun of great movies (like Meatballs) and lesser movies of the 80's. It's just a parody. Even a great movie like Meatballs (with superior acting, directing and production) doesn't deserve 5 stars. There are some funny scenes in the film, but that's about it. I'd rather watch Meatballs, or the State."
5,fabulous,i love this movie. it is hilarious and everything you want from a comedy. I would suggest this to anyone with a immature sense of humor.
3,Half good,I bought this movie because I read some good reviews. Mistake! The movie was actually really good for about an hour. I laughed so hard at some parts. The rest of the movie was stupid. It got so ridiculous that I almost stopped watching it. I think the first half is worth watching so you should see this movie but I wouldn't buy it.
1,Please...just say no!!!!!!!!,"I was really looking forward to a funny movie with a lot of belly laughs. Unfortunatly, the only thing my belly felt was the need for Alka-Seltzer. It's too bad because the talent level in this movie I thought was very good and I still believe that. It only leads me to believe the old expression ""garbage in garbarge out""."
1,'Just not MY cup of tea!,"The vast majority of reviewers of this film rate it highly. Well, I am going to have to join the minority. It's just not funny at all. The attempts at humor seem ""forced"" and the ""satire"" just doesn't work.For me, the main reason for renting the film was to see how Chris Meloni, a favorite of mine, handled comedy. He does fine, considering what he's working with.David Hyde-Pierce, another favorite, is wasted...as is anyone's time viewing.I'll certainly get some ""non-helpful"" nods, but I have to call it as I see it."
1,I don't get it....,"I had read great reviews of this movie, and was looking forward to watching it on dvd..the whole time i did watch it i made this face like, what is going on? It was totally not what I thought it would be. I thought it would be a spoof on those late 70's early 80's summer movies, but it doesn't feel like that at all to me.This is not funny at all, I didn't laugh at all. I thought it was very strange also. I never watched the State, and the director and one of the actors, David Wain and Michael Showalter, were both on that show.Maybe I just don't get this brand of comedy if it is supposed to be one. It must take a certain individual to appreciate this film and I am not it. My husband said they should pay people to watch this one.Avoid this ..if you want real comedy about summer camp, watch Meatballs...spoof or not. if you are a fan of the state or upright citizen's brigade, you will probably appreciate it...i don't get this brand of humor at all."
1,What a waste of time.....,"I never heard of this movie before I saw it on the Amazon web site. Being a big fan of Garafalo and having enjoyed the work of Hyde Pierce on Frasier, I was really excited to see this movie-- especially after seeing all the great reviews it received on Amazon.I seriously hope that the actors in this movie were paid enough that they will never have to work again because it's movies like this that ruin careers. This movie suffers from bad writing, a lack of continuity, an uninteresting and undeveloped plot and-- it pains me to say this-- bad acting. Often, bad films can actually be funny for all the wrong reasons, however, this movie isn't even unintentionally funny. The film is good for one or, maybe, two smirks while the rest of time is spent feeling genuinely embarrassed for everyone involved. Avoid this one...."
3,Sigh...,"I had heard so many good things about this movie:""Cult classic"" ""Total 80's throwback hilarious"" ...But, I was disappointed.I love the cast, and I love that most of the cast were members of the comedy troupe/show ""The State""...but I thought a lot of the jokes were forced and contrived. The dialogue ( and recital OF the dialogue ) was really weak at times. I wanted to really enjoy it, but I was let down. I will admit, there are definitely some major crack-up scenes. They are few and far between though."
5,"Even when it's a bit stupid, it's still smartly funny.","Had heard about this film for a long time. It has a rabid fan base. Now I finally know why (and have joined that fan base).WHAS has just the right kind of off-center sensibility to be unique in its voice. EVERY actor in the film totally sells their character 100%. I feel a little bad for anyone whose sense of humor doesn't align with this film. I found myself laughing quite loudly numerous times, often at a throwaway line or sight gag, of which there are many.There are one or two bits that just fell flat for me, but those were rare and did not in anyway take away from my enjoyment of the film. It's a home run."
3,Sketch Comics Unleashed,"This may have been the single dumbest movie I've seen since the Zuckers were in their prime, but it kept me laughing even as I told myself the jokes were too stupid to be enjoying so much. Featuring a crazy cast of alumnus from no less than four different sketch comedy shows (including about 75% of The State), it's overloaded with sight gags and rudimentary puns hiding around every corner. Over two dozen primary characters compete for the chance to shout out the next punchline, none of which have the depth of a sheet of plywood, while the story is merrily thrown into the brush and abandoned at several points. It's the film you'd have made with the crazy guys who lived down the hallway in college."
2,Raunchy,Raunchy slapstick juvenile improbable situations. Interesting view of some who have become name stars. Situations and language not suitable for youngsters or the easily shocked. But funny for those who aren't.
2,"a little funny, a little weird...","Pretty funny most of the time, but a little weird. I thought it was a typical stoner movie, but it really wasnt'. It was a good camp movie, but some of the parts and scenes didn't mesh well at all, it's kind of all over the place. I liked it cause it had jenne garfalo and paul rudd..."
1,huh,"I really thought this movie was going to be funny. I was wrong. There were some MILDLY funny parts, but nothing to crack up over. I do not recommend this movie."
3,Fun but...,"I've always been a fan of the 'guilty pleasures' films which this film takes it's inspiration. And the first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film led me to believe that these filmmakers were on track to make a authentic and entertaining send-up of this genre. Unfortunately, I guess they couldn't resist taking the film into the broad sketch comedy territory that they're more accustomed to. The tone of the comedy is inconsistent which is too bad, because this charming cast of mostly fresh faces is really doing some nice work here. Nonetheless, there are some great laughs and fun nostalgic moments. Anyone who remembers those silly... comedies from the early eighties should enjoy this film, even with the missed opportunities."
2,I'd rather watch reruns of SALUTE YOUR SHORTS!!!,"I've noticed that all of the positive reviews here are bashing those of us who find this movie unfunny. I appreciate good, quirky humor and rented this hoping for another PORKY'S or MEATBALLS. I can't believe anyone agreed to produce this movie. Sure, it has a couple of genuinely funny scenes. However, mostly it's just a bunch of unrelated vignettes fueled by no real plot. This movie includes a man humping a refrigerator (this same man talks to a can of mixed vegetables),a horrible ""semi-spoof"" of ARMAGEDDON, and pathetic attempts at satirizing 70s and 80s camp movies. The only thing going for this movie is the cast. If you're like me, you'll rent this regardless of what everyone else has to say. I just hope you find it more enjoyable than I did."
1,Surgeon General Warning: This movie[is not good]!!!,"It is Friday night, and while I should be immersed in some good ol' fashioned whiskey drinkin' and butt kickin' at my local saloon, I am not. I am sick like dog and I think there's a correlation between my illness and having watched this movie. I thought it was a funny idea- a spoof of the teen summer camp genre, but unbeknownst to me the hilarity stopped there. The only time I laughed was when my roommates and I said how much this classic blew....Avoid this screen gem at all costs, it may be carcinogenic."
5,My type of movie,"This was a pleasant surprise when I first saw it. For me it has to do with the over the top comedy & the first rate cast involved. If you really want to laugh at the antics of a funny guy watch Chrisopher Meloni, his ""I neeed Parsley"" in the deleted scenes had me rolling every time I turned it on. All I can really say is I hope that the makers of this film can turn out another one on the same level."
1,Not funny at all . . .,"I repeat: this movie is not funny. I was recommended this movie and I really hoped it would be hilarious considering the cast, but the jokes are lame and the delivery of these jokes even lamer. A lot of bad, trite writing."
1,stinkeroo,"I grew up in the 80s and have seen all the summer camp movies. Funny but I never realized this was a spoof as those summer camp movies are all pretty over the top anyway. Maybe I'm dense, but I just didn't find anything funny about this. It playes almost EXACTLY like one of those bad 80s movies. If you want something way over the top watch any Corey Haim movie from the 80s. Don't waste your time with this...."
1,Awful,"Couldn't believe how bad this was. Not funny bad, just awful. Why was this film made? Who financed it? Save your time and money. A total waste. You have been warned!"
1,Really?,"This is, quite possibly, the worst film I've ever seen and I've seen some REALLY bad movies. It is so far out there that I'm not even sure the filmmakers get it. It's not even remotely funny."
4,Endearingly Silly,"This comedy is better if you actually remember 1981. The attitudes, irresponsibility, and rebellion of these times is accurate. I never went to summer camp, but the stories of counselors being college aged boys and girls involved in rampant sex and drugs has been repeated too many times not to have a grain of truth. This movie doesn't so much condone it but rather mocks their attitudes that they ever expected to be taken seriously as authority figures. It was like the mouse guarding the cheese."
5,a great funny movie with a bit of raunch tucked in,I have always liked this movie. It's funny to watch again and again. There are a few parts of the movie that if you can't deal with a little raunchy humor then you should not watch this. But if you have a great sense of humor I would totally recommend this movie.
1,A confused collection of papers.,"May be it could be better to name this book a collection of papers and theses. I recommend reading papers, themselves; as there is no good book on space time coding and MIMO yet. These paper collections are biased."
2,This book is not good,"I have read several books about space-time coding, I think this book is not good for the new readers althouth it says ""I am an introduction"". This book is only an orginization of many papers and the auther's work. In my opinion, Larsson's ""Space-time block coding for wireless communications"" is much better!"
4,Works great for me!,"I have bought two of the 1TB models and am ordering a 2TB model this week. They are a wonderful way to get cheap storage on the network. We have a large network (healthcare facility) and have had no problems like others have mentioned. My only problem is that it has trouble working with large AD structures. Fortunately, while our AD is very large, we also have a second, smaller AD domain for special admin purposes. Because we are only using these boxes for admin purposes, I installed them on that AD and they work fine. No problems with IP addresses or time synch, just followed the directions out of the box. I'm a domain admin with years of *nix and Windows experience, maybe that helps?"
3,LG300 Field Target Rifle (FT),"The product description above may NOT be for the rifle shown in the pictures.The barrel shroud is made from 2 sections of aluminum and is notcarbon fiber.There is another version of this rifle that has a laminated stock anddoes have a carbon fiber shroud. It's more of a Hunter style rifle.My rifle is the same model as the one shown in the picturesand it shoots pretty well. The trigger and adjustable stockare top notch. The newer model regulators work well also.If you have a local scuba shop that can fill tanks to300 bar (4350 psi) and own a 300 bar tank of course, you're all set. :)On the negative side, this rifle is too heavy for anything butbench & FT shooting."
1,it sucks,"it sucks like my girlfriends, and she sucks A LOT!!!!!!!!!! if u know what i mean.my watergun is better than this gun"
3,WTF???,"I bet this gun is like godly, but it still makes like no sense to buy a gun for 1,800,000 dollars, I mean come on.....You might as well buy a real gun for cheaper. I dont care if it shoots 9 million fps, the cost is just way to much for a airsoft gun......I MEAN COME ON! ITS A BLOODY AIRSOFT GUN.....WHO (besides millionares)CAN AFFORD THIS FLIPPIN GUN? and don't tell me ur rich"
5,A great alternative if you can't go to the Trellis,"Lucky me, I'm an hour away from Marcel's restaurant in Williamsburg, so I've had the pleasure of enjoying some of the delicious treats in this book. Those I have made on my own (the cookies, the date cake) turned out terrific -- the recipes are easy to follow and the pictures just make your mouth water. This is a great book to have if you like to bake for special occasions, or if you just like having something chocolate around the house."
4,Decadent and time-consuming,"Cookbooks simply don't get more luscious, heavenly, or pompous than this one. The simplest recipes in this book take hours to make: the more complicated are recommended to take several days. One of the best (and certainly the best flourless) chocolate cakes I've had in my life came out of this book: I had less luck on my own making a simpler cookie recipe.The directions are amazingly detailed, but this book simply isn't appropriate for beginners or people with quasi-normal kitchens, and you're left to your own devices if you want to adapt them. Fair warning: this book requires serious skill and care."
5,Very Pleased !!!,"I had Marcel Desaulniers updated Death by Chocolate book and was left feeling that something was missing. There was... Variety, ease. I am no master baker. Just a novice. I also collect books for dinner parties, but that book left me a little shaken. I felt it was for the way advanced, those who like to spend all day in the kitchen whipping up desserts. I do not. On the suggestion of one of the reviewers, I searched high and low for this book, and found it, here on amazon. I am not displeased at all. This book contaians very elegant desserts at what seems the fraction of the prep time from the other. And you can not ask for more variety from a chocolate master like Desaulniers. He give you drinks spiked with chocolate, and desserts for both white and dark chocolate. Scintallating."
4,Heavenly,"This book is beautiful to look at in addition to having incredible recipes. Some of them are a bit complicated, but for the most part, worth the effort."
5,The best chocolate cookbook I ve ever read!,"I love this book , the steps of each recipe are very easy to follow ( perhaps this wonderfulls desserts are quite expensive to be done , but that wasn t a good reason for me) , I did most of the recipes of this book and they were the best choclate desserts i ve ever done. I don t know The Trellis restaurant but I think how much must cost a piece of cake , with all the ingredients it has on it. All the persons who eat a piece of all the cakes and pastrys I did told me:Give me the secret of this recipe! , and I answered : CHOCOLATE!"
1,Oh my gosh!! A truly thought provoking book!!!,"If you want to be intellectually stimulated. By-golly, this is the book for you! The metaphors in this book he makes have truly put a new frontier out for the mind. How he never really says that all food is compared to life, but subtly adds it, blows my mind. Even the title, Death by chocolate, is such a deep metaphor that only people such as the weak minded won't get it."
5,THE BEST Nail Polish Remover,"Pretty Nails is, without a doubt, the best nail polish remover on the market.I have been using this remover for at least 20 years. I previously was able to pick it up at any time in the local drug store. It became harder and harder to find. Now is it not available anywhere in South Florida that I could locate. So I was forced to order it on line. I normally would not object to that, but it cost more for shipping and handling than it did for the product. I also received an email asking how my service from Amazon was, before I received my order....well, I expected to receive it within 10 days. It took 25 days. Tough way to have to get something so simple as polish remover. Please folks try this product so we can get it back in our local stores and available. Product works great and has an adaptor for taking polish off your toes. It is THE BEST."
