2,Technically superficial,"This title, it promises to be a guide for whoever wants to learn to use CORBA with Java.Unfortunately already the beginning is not of the best in as behavior a general panning of the two languages ok but throw the reader in a chaos of acronyms no (C. 2).The authors, they should know that a book that is proposed teach something it should have a method. This text doesn't have it. In fact the chapter 5 (The First Java app) it leave the reader with many doubts that they will have filled (perhaps) in the chapter 8 (you after a complete guide to the Api of Corba present like a glossary- chap 6).Finally, after have read this book, I could tell that beyond to have not understood nothing almost (I am a Engineer specialized in new tech) I have had clean feeling to be a total stupid. Thank you"
1,Huh???,"I'm a Microsoft COM/DCOM person, very technical, needing to understand the alternative technology: CORBA. This book spends time explaining the OMG organizational structure, committee procedures, etc and when you get to the more technical sections you forget you left the prior section. I couldn't grasp the concepts or map them into anything I know. It lacks a clear direction or teaching methodology. They guys at Visigenic recommended this book, but I give it a thumbs down. When I was through the first few chapters I said, ""Huh???"" and promptly returned to book for a refund."
4,Good introduction to the subject,"This book is a good introduction to understanding how and why corrosion occurs on a boat. It covers materials of construction in great detail with many chapters on various metals but is somewhat weak on a number of significant issues such as reference cells, measuring potentials, cathodic protection calculations and stray currents."
5,Will Save a Boat Owner Lots of Dollars,"This book by Mr. Collier reads like a textbook at times as it covers the theory behind corrosion. But it's not that hard and if you can get a handle on the info in this book, you'll get a handle on the corrosion on your boat and I can pretty much guarantee you that it'll save you mega headaches, mega problems and mega bucks down the road."
1,Apartment 1303 Don't fall asleep...,This movie was just about the most boring movie I've ever seen...about bedtime!!If you want to watch something to help you fall asleep this is the one!!I rate this dvd a 1 of 5 Stars!!
4,Asian horror at it's best.,"Having watched over a dozen Asian horror films from Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Korea, this one is definitely one of the better. I don't speak Japanese so I cant really tell weather the acting in the dialog part is good or not. But the rest is just brilliant. The style of both the story and cinematography is very claustrophobic and eerie. It slowly builds up the suspense and towards the end both me and my girl friend were at the edge of our seats."
2,Like a J-Horror Cliff notes......,"I just watched this film (""Apartment 1303"") today and was really disappointed.To steal from a reviewer with better wit than I, ""it was new and good...but whatwas new wasn't good and what was good wasn't new"". I watch a lot of AsianHorror, but this was mostly derivative, touching all the necessary bases:1)scary kid, check, 2) creepy elevator, check, 3)moist noises, check, 4) ghostin a closet, check, 5)hair growing out of the wall and grabbing you, check,5) real estate people turning a blind eye to repeated deaths, check. In summarythis is Dark Water meets Ju-On (the originals, not the lousy remakes) but notdone as well. Move along, nothing to see here."
2,High Expection Met With Major Disappointment....,"This movie was pretty lame. At first, I thought I was in for a treat, then when you see the ghost, all the fear just washed away. It was especially scary near the beginning and a little bit around the middle, but it just died off from there. Highly disappointed, wouldn't watch it again unless someone paid me $100 (anyone?).If you're looking for something that'll keep you at the edge of your seat and your an avid horror watcher, watch this out of curiosity, but simply just that...Wait until they show you the ghost lady, talking about lame. That's when the whole movie really dropped down my scale...major disappointment, someone fire the costume designer."
4,Ahh good old American History,"Impartial presentation of unsolved mysteries of American history, the author gives all comparative points of view as well as utmost current revisionist views of unsolved history. I especially enjoyed the fact that at the end of each subject the author gives you a list of additional research for each subject, as this book contains 30 subjects and lightly give the reader a brief scenario of each topic, not nearly as in-depth as some may like but enough to provoke further research. The author has done a very fine job of compiling the facts of each event and presenting them with in the timeline of history."
5,An Interesting Look At The Major Events Of The US,"This book gives all of its readers a very interesting and in depth veiw of the major events that have shaped America's History. even if you dont know abot all of the events that are included within its pages, it is stil very intriuging. I would say that if if American History floats your boat give this book a read."
3,Just a battery for a nearly obsolete laptop,"My laptop is so old (2003 G4), that anything that keeps it going is fine with me. The biggest advantage if this package of the charger and the battery is that it is just a fraction of the price that Apple sells it for. I only get about 3 hours of life out of the battery at a time, but that's still better than nothing!"
1,Battery mismanufactured. Contacts do not work. Useless.,Ordered a replacement battery for a G4 Mac Powerbook. Completely useless. Contacts are misaligned and cause battery to not function at all. Battery appears to have been mismanufactured. No sign of external damage. Quite disappointed.
5,Replacement Battery,I have installed this replacement battery in my computer and have found it to work properly. It charged properly and appears to last a reasonable amount of time - 2 hours fully charged watching a movie on a six-year-old MacBook Pro. It recharged in less than an hour. The vendor sent the product as promised and it arrived well within the expected/promised time frame. There were no surprises.
2,Xmas with Johnny Mathis,"Disappointing. I love Mathis' warm honeyed voice, but there are few songs, and the song sequence is poor. Sound quality varies from song to song. Not much thoughtful production behind this one, I'm afraid"
5,Great Christmas CD!,"I listened to this album when I was growing up and really enjoyed the tunes. Johnny Mathis has a voice as smooth and pure as they come! My kids had looked for this CD in the stores and couldn't find it and so I decided to go online! Thanks to Amazon I enjoyed the Holiday Season WITH Johnny. I played it at my family gathering and everyone was singing along to ""Let it Snow"" and ""It's a Marshmallow World"". Every song is a delight!"
4,Another Traditional Christmas Favorite For This Family!,"And it has been for Decades because we originally bought this in LP (Vinyl) Format in The Mid 70's. After Decades of Wear & Tear: our Old Album was finally Tossed last year because we replaced it with This CD from Amazon AND these Christmas Classics have never sounded better! There is no sense in listing the Songs I like best here because I like them all!Final Note: There are 2 Songs missing on this CD that were on The Original LP but it don't really matter to us because we have Two Christmas CD's by Johnny. The other Disc is called ""Johnny Mathis (With Percy Faith & His Orchestra) Songs For Christmas"". Check that one out because it is Great too and there are no Duplicates between the two CD's & ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas""!"
2,Science is solid but will not work for everyone and side effects are there too.,"I checked out the science behind this product and it seems legit but this didn't work for me, well it did but it worked too well and I was only taking one pill a day, it kinda kills your sex drive, I haven't been able to achieve my full size since I've been off this (been more than one week) so try it if you need to but, it didn't work for me though."
1,Didn't work for me.,Tried these pills with now success. Even tried taking the double dose a couple hours before and the only thing it did was keep me up.
3,VINTAGE HISTORICAL ROMANCE.,"This almost-forgotten flick from 1932 is a lavishly adorned costume epic which is set during the Russian Revolution. Aristocratic Fairbanks plays Nikiti who flees his Russian home with his maid Tanyusha (the elusive-on-video Nancy Carroll). The lovers end up in Constantinople where they marry and settle into a life of common labour. Eventually, Fairbank's cultured personality makes him discontented with his new life & he succumbs to having an affair with a vampy woman named Vera (Lilyan Tashman)...The plot drags in bits, and the movie is somewhat uneven, however the magnificent sets are impressive: from the great aristocratic homes to the lowly Turkish dives. Notable mostly for a rare glimpse of the once-popular and talented Nancy Carroll, an actress of Irish descent who was in many fine films during the early talkies. More of her finer films hopefully will find their way to video in the near future!"
5,a very rare film,"This rare and very excellent movie has to be discovered. Real jewel of the beginner talking cinema, with a not-very-well-known subject and the young but already excellent actor Douglas Fairbanks jr. Was the outcome, the official idea of the USA at the beginning of the 30s, namely a certain accommodation with regard to the Soviet regime, a criticism of the renunciation of the Western countries, an idyllic romantic happy end imposed by producers, an ideological blindness, quite at once. I hope that a day ""Scarlet dawn"" will be a DVD with subtitled multi-languages and notices about the director and the subject."
1,"wrong photo, wrong tape","The cassette pictured contains two complete albums, the covers of which are shown in the photo ""The Times they are a Changin""; and ""Bob Dylan"", but what I was sent, and I can only assume the all the sellers are offering, is only the first one, ""The Times they are a Changin'.Since I am looking for a track from the second album, entitled 'Freight Train Blues, I was-am disappointed.My ""Bob Dylan"" tape broke and I am-was looking for a replacement. yes, I am still in cassette-tape era...1995 toyota corolla. I also have vinyl at home"
1,Very dissapointed,"This book looks good, sounds good but completely disappointes from the view of offering helpful spiritual and/or practical knowledge about living with bipolar. Even God would be dissapointed in your use of his ""endorsment"" used seemingly in order to sell this book."
4,Nice,this is the watch I was looking for unfortunately the face with smaller than my older 1 so I gave it to my nephew it's an awesome watch.
4,Perfect for Plant Enthusiasts,"This disc truly captures the wit and wisdom of one of America's premier perennial gardeners, Dr. Allan Armitage of the University of Georgia. Dr. Armitage has a wealth of knowledge and experience regarding the care and growing of a wide variety of perennial plants.Stroll along with Dr. Armitage and learn firsthand information on the care and growing of 160 different perennials ranging from Acanthus to Yucca. Dr. Armitage's great stories, eye-catching videos, beautiful photos, and great tips and information make learning about these great plants easy and entertaining. This is the perfect reference piece for experts and novices alike."
4,LUTHER SURE LOOKED DIFFERENT BACK IN THE EARLY DAYS...,"... having worked for a prominent cosmetic surgeon, I tend to spot facial details that most people miss... for instance, Luther's ears here appear to be quite close to his head, while photos in more recent years make them appear to be more prominent... also, he had a more masculine look to his face here, but later in his career he appeared far more feminine-looking... these are just observations, not criticisms - none of this changes the fact that he was an awesome vocalist who, like Prince, wore many hats in the recording of his albums, serving as singer-songwriter-arranger-producer, although I would have loved to hear him pair up with Quincy Jones at least once just to see what they could have come up with together."
1,Like a Replica Ferrari.....,solely for looks but poor function. I returned it the same day it was received. The mineral glass has too much magnification because it is curved and the watch sits uncomfortably on the wrist. Money would be better spent on a Seiko or a Casio G shcok in this price range.
2,TOO MUCH CRAP!!!,"While the non-Beany-and-Cecil-cartoon stuff was mildly interesting, it's stupid to have any of it at the expense of more of the cartoons. They should have released ALL the cartoons on DVD and put the extra stuff in ONLY if there was room on one of the discs."
1,"When, Oh When?","Although this item was ordered in late August, I still haven't received it (10.18.05)."
2,Footnote to previous reviewers,"As I understand, this musical poison-pen letter is addressed to the management at World Serpent Distribution.Yes, it is disappointing, isn't it! Lyrically irrelevant to everyone except Douglas, Boyd, Dave, Andy and Alison. Musically, a regression to the old D.i.J formula after the creative renaissance of `Take Care'/`Hummingbird'. (The way it divides sharply into `folk' and `industrial' segments reminds me of `The Wall of Sacrifice'...but the comparison stops there)."
5,Prophet Muhammad: Aspects of His Life,"This was the title of previous print of The Messenger of God: Muhammad. Prophet Muhammad is the person which affects lives of millions of muslims today. If you know any muslim and interested in their believes, this is a must read. If you wonder what this Islam is, this is a must read. If you heard a lot about him, this is a must read.The book is from the best known Turkish scholar M.Fethullah Gulen, who is a major character at the interfaith movement within Islam Society."
5,do u doa?,i have all the doa games so when i got part 4 i ran into all of good fighters online this guide let me sharpen my skills so i can give those challangers online a run for their money and thanks to this guide i learn to master more characters.
1,You get what you pay for,"I'm very disappointed with this product, but I guess that's what I should have expected for the price. The frame was warped and there was damage to the decorative overlay. The tacks have to be hammered in, and when I did so the award ended up crooked. There is really no easy way to get the tacks back out, so it's stuck that way and now I've got an awful looking award. Be aware of the quality of this item, and if it's for something important, pay a bit extra and get something nicer. Don't make the same mistake I did. I for sure will not buy anything by this company again."
3,Holes don't align.,The holes don't align with the cut out that good but overall it's an alright product for the price.The plastic part sticks up after i've nailed the holes. It looks good from a far but up close I'm not too happy.
2,Had difficulty with screws,"It looks really nice, but my co-worker had difficulty with the final touches of the nails or whatever screws that it came with. This was bad, because it was the day of the program and he was scrambling to find an alternative. Advice- put together the frame, etc. well in advance just in case you have to go to the hardware store!!!"
5,A good value.,I needed a wall plaque for an important certificate and was pleased to find this one at a good price.
2,Much less than expected,"Purchased this item to accompany a similar plaque on the office wall. This item was close in appearance but that is where the similarities end. The marbled look is, as expected, a thin paper laminate over wood. This is the case with most plaques of this style. The problem with this one is that the laminate is not adhered to the wood very well at all, and gives a bubbled wavy look to the piece. The second, and greater, problem is the plastic cover. It is very thin. This was not expected. Other similar products come with a cover that is thick and rigid (4-5mm). this product comes with a cover that is about 1mm thick. This causes the cover to not lay flat against the frame and gives off a very wavy appearance. This also causes quite a bit of glare from office lights.Would not recommend this product. I give it an additional star for staying hung on the wall, the wooded frame itself is fairly sturdy."
4,Good concept for an anthology,"This anthology collects the first published stories of writers who would later go on to be among the most celebrated names in science fiction. Some authors, such as Lester del Rey and Theodore Sturgeon, improved greatly later to judge from their sub-standard initial offerings. AE Van Vogt's inexplicably beloved ""Black Destroyer"" is also anthologized here yet again. Yet these and a few other disappointments are offset by some remarkable stories from Zenna Henderson, Algis Budrys, Philip K. Dick, Avram Davidson, JG Ballard, and others."
2,Average Quasi Bootleg Copies,"Check carefully when looking at these listings. If the product originates from an outfit by the name of [...], you can expect to get average to poor copies of the show. They will NOT be the high quality you might expect from an Amazon DVD purchase. The discs are copies of German-issued DVDs and with slightly redesigned cases. (My guess is that's why they are not corralled for copyright infringement.) The cover inserts and disc labels are printed off a regular inkjet or color copier and though they are shrink-wrapped and labeled as having a security device enclosed, they are not what you would consider to be ""store bought."" Before you spend $50 on this, check around and decide if you really want these."
2,Year and one half old - now useless,"I was very pleased with this watch for the year and a half. however, It typically lost a minute or so every couple of weeks so I set it almost weekly. The last time I went to set I unscrewed the crown as usual but when I pulled the stem out it completely disengaged from the watch. I contacted Invicta and was informed that the stem had sheared and that it was a rather simple repair, however the estimate for the shipping and repair offered by Invicta cost more than I paid for the watch new from Amazon. I took it to a couple of watch repair shops and was informed by both that the repair was rather simple but the part from Invicta was rather expensive. Both advised that, considering the cost of repair and the value of the watch, that I not wast the money repairing it. I was very disappointed and am not likely to purchase another Invicta watch."
2,Gains 10 min a week,"It's a beautiful, sturdy watch but my husband has worn it for 3 months now and it gains almost 10 minutes a week, which is very annoying! I expected better."
4,Excellent,This is a fantastic movie about a man with a violent and immoral past finding the will to change after getting struck by lightening. How real this is portrayed is amazing! Thanks for this incredible true story.
4,Tape vs The Book,I read the book first then saw the movie. The movie was easier to understand but the book was in further detail of the experiences of Dannion Brinkley.
4,Inspirational,"Watching this video was a door way in elevating my mind and spiritual connection with the MOST HIGH. This video made me realize that we are light beings and death isn't the end, its actually the beginning. In addition, we must be like God and live in love with one another,uphold morality,forgive one another, and stay away from the materialistic world, if we don't do so then we will never ascend in our spiritual quest of knowing GOD. Right now i have learned that my soul is immortal and that the Father has a Paradise place for me. I don't fear death or anything on this earth anymore. My reasons for being on this world is to teach my neighbors about GOD and his promise, but most importantly to help the less fortunate. May You all attain spiritual ascension so we can be happy in Paradise with the SUPREME BEING."
5,Life Enchancing and Life Changing!,"I first saw ""Saved by the Light"" when it was broadcast in 1995. I was in the hospital during the holidays and had just come out of intensivre csre. My hospital stay was difficult. This film touched me very deeply and was very healing. The next time I saw it was two years later, on the eve of another unexpected trip to the hospital! I mention this because, as you can see by many of these reviews, this film carries a meaning and purpose. Each time I saw it, it helped me deal with my situation immensely. Thanks to Eric Roberts for portraying such a dynamic, vivid Dannion! Thanks to Dannion for bringing his message to us. Thanks to everyone who contributed to this excellent, beautiful film. I hope you can find a copy. I shared my worn out copy, taped off TV, many times and have recently purchased a newer one here in ZShops. If you need a lift, or some faith...this one is for you! Peace to You and Be Well! ..."
5,Saved by the Light,I saw this movie when it was broadcast on television. I have been searching everywhere for the video. No where to be found. Unfortunate. I was spritually changed when I saw this movie. I have heard Dannion interviewed several times. Each time I hear him I thank God for allowing him to stay with us a little longer to teach us how to be loving and compassionate beings. Everyone needs to see this movie and I pray daily that it will be re-released.
5,This movie could change your life.,"This is quite simply an amazing story. It made me have a completely different outlook on how I treat other people , and what is really important in this life. This might sound like an over- reaction to to a movie, but for me this story was like finding out the secret of life."
4,Inspirational Work - but not a brginner's guide,"All of Amano books are extremely beautiful and inspiring. They provide fodder for designing amazing planted aquariums. He uses an approach similar to Japanese gardening and arrangement. He incorporates both traditional modes and natural landscape.However, I only gave it four stars because Anamo's description of his technical skills and planning is very limited. His explanations require some basic aquarium knowledge like nitrogen cycles, plant and animal compatibility, and basic water chemistry.This is perfect for an intermediate aquarium hobbyist. It also works as a great coffee table book."
4,Inspiration for Aquascaping,Volume 1 is a good book to introduce Amano's creation so hobbyist can't resist to buy the other volume.Worth to add your ref book.
5,Good Reading,This was the best book that I have read in a long time. It really kept my interest from cover to cover.
4,Familiarity Breeds Knowledge,"It's said that a writer should write about what they know. It is apparent that Mr. Strunk is intimately familiar with south central Kentucky and north central/eastern Tennessee. If the reader is familiar with this area, they will instantly recognize the composite characters made up from local residents. Life in this area is different than life any where else. Mr. Strunk has hit the nail on the head with his descriptions and depictions. ""Throwback"" paints an accurate picture of the thinking patterns and survival instincts of the people of the region."
3,"Well done, but lacking in depth","This book is of high quality as are all in this series. However, it lacks the depth that it should have. It doesn't capture the full flavor of the state. Too much space is devoted to the largest cities in the state. Also, many photographers apparently used their own children as subjects for their photos. One even took a photo of people looking at an exhibit of his photos.Give me a break.There are good photos in the book, but it is not photojournalism."
3,"decent, but good have been better","I really enjoy the America 24/7 series of books, but this one could have been much better. There are only a few photos that actually give any indepth coverage of the state. Some of the photos don't really even tell a story about Kentucky as they are too generalized and, even worse, lack in artistic quality. It's a decent book to put on a table, but not much more."
1,Poor extremist hate,"On look at this person's 'blog' will show you that he is a raving Anti-Semite, who will stop at nothing to bad mouth Jews."
5,Best European Rockabilly Band,"Now it's nearly 16 years ago I first heard Restless on their ""Why don't you just rock""-album. It's still fantastic Neo-Rockabilly. Tough and fast and of an extraordinary musical ability. If this record don't move your feet -you're dead! This record is really a classic. Don't wait -buy it!"
2,Free AAA Guide Book Better!,"I love watching the Bay Area Backroads TV show. I thought the card deck would be as advertised, toss in your glove compartment and off you go!There are lots of cards of individual landmarks to visit and one fold out card with a very simple map, but you will still need a real map, lodging book and a restaurant guide to make a nice trip out of any one of the destination cards. I think I will stick to cutting the weekend trip guides out of Sunset and Via magazines. I was dissapointed with the card set."
4,Great gift,"I gave this as a gift to my boyfriend (who was not from CA) at the time. Being from the Bay Area, I wanted to give him something that would help us explore the area together. It has great ideas and just the appropriate amount of information and inspiration! Highly recommend it for someone who's recently relocated or visiting the Bay Area."
1,Playing cards; not a book!,"I thought this was a book until I received it in the mail. It's 50 ""playing cards""; stiff paper looseleaf cards. I would have preferred a book and will have to be more careful next time I purchase from Amazon.com."
3,Interesting for the Canine Behaviorist or Naturalist,"Claire Carr, longtime writer of Newfoundland topics and Newfie owner, has written a book based on the disappearance and eventual return of two of her dogs. This is not your standard ""noble Newfie"" book from the perspective of humans. Rather, the book is written largely from the point of view of the two dogs and their adventures in the wild. Carr is an excellent observer of both nature and her dogs and the detailed text reflects this acuity. Her sketches of the dogs and other wildlife pepper the book and are overall very good. My only criticism of this work is that is rather long and I found several typographical errors. I think it would have great appeal for anyone interested in dog behavior or Southwestern nature."
4,As an extra resource,"I currently use The Reese Chronological Bible as an additional resource for the women's bible study class that I teach. It helps with keeping timelines straight. I purchased and additional copy for my mother-in-law, who reads the bible cover to cover every year. She really enjoys this book and finds it to be a better resource than other chronologicl bibles that she has read."
5,Very helpful Bible reading,This Bible has been helpful in my Bible study. I am really enjoying it and would highly recommend it.
5,Great Bible,"The Reese Chronological Bible is a great Bible. It is well researched. The main reason I like it is, is because it has a flow to it like a book. When one reads it, one realizes that the the Bible is is a whole, complete story."
5,Best ever,"This is simply put the best single investment I have ever made ever.I use it everyday as a study Bible and it makes the Bible so crystal clear.It has the KJV words only without anyone,s comments and has blank pages in the back for the notes.Drawback,s-there are 2--- #1.you cannot use it in church as it skips around a lot.#2.It does have minor placement errors.It puts Job with Genesis and places Judah and Israel history side by side so it is really easy to know what,s going on in each place at the same time.Bottom line-Buy this Bible if you want the Bible to be so clear and jump out at you.I have never grew so much in the Lord till I got this version.I am sorry to repeat myself but this Bible is so fantastic,I absolutely guarantee you will love it."
5,Chronological bible pieces the Bible together,"Love this bible, reads almost like a story and the parallel passages shed more light and depth on what is happening concurrently or from more than one perspective. I use this bible as my night stand bible. I started from the beginning and am reading straight through.Has an index that easily lets you find the passage you are looking for.I think that all people wanting a deeper relationship with God and Jesus Christ will be blessed by this bible."
5,Great!!,"I am really enjoying my Chronological Bible. It is everything I expected and I can now sit down and read in the order things probably happened. I used to reference myself the order of events and skip around my Bible...I enjoy this a lot more. Great quality as well and price was the best on Amazon. Don't forget to sign up for the credit card, you'll get $30.00 off your order, I wound up paying $5.18 for this book and one other."
2,Must have gotten a faulty one...,Very easy installation but it died on me after only 3 months. Amazon is sending a replacement and based on others' reviews I'm going to chalk it up to a faulty device. Hope the replacement lasts longer!
3,"It's ok, if you have basically no money.","I bought this card thinking it would be amazing. It is, compared to the onboard graphics I was using previously. It runs Halo 1 great, as long as you have specular turned off (now how it runs Half-Life 2 and not Halo beats me). It has a good settings menu, and is highly customizable. However, because it's a PCI card, don't expect it to run games like Halo 2 or Crysis... or really any game from 2005 to now. I got tired of seeing bad graphics with this card, so I was forced to overclock it. Now, it runs fantastically. Halo still lags, though. I'd suggest that, if you have $60-$100 lying around, take that and buy another card. This one isn't worth the slot."
5,PNY Geforce FX5200,Great little video card. Reasonably priced and ran all of the games I tried on it. Most of my games are a couple of years old. I did not try any of the new high end games on it. I expect thy might not work on this card. No fan on the card and it does run very warm. So far it has not failed because of the heat.Larry
3,Basic model,"Basic model video card, works well, have never had a problem with one. Not top shelf but most surely good for above standard graphics needs."
4,Good experience,"This was about the best graphics card I could find for my pci port. Unfortunately I don't have pci express ports to support todays superior graphics cards. The experience was great. I definitely gained a new friend (Tiger Direct) that I will be using as much as possible, at least as much as my wife will let me.....ha ha"
2,"Functional, Not Fast","Well, don't expect anything spectacular. I put this in my P3 866mhz machine and it did speed up the video response over the integrated graphics chip, but maybe by 15 %. My 6 year old daughter said it didn't help speed up Webkinz."
5,Good Results,"Card purchased to add extended life to a legacy Celeron HP Pavilion. Video Card greatly improved overall performance. Product physically easy to install. Configuration of software/drivers required trial and error techniques. Overall, product works very well and satisfied with final outcome."
2,It didn't work on my computer,"Though I asked a couple of help desks whether this one would be appropriate for my computer and set up it still didn't work. The PNY help desk suggested it might be because I needed a bigger power supply. I bought one and installed it and still had the same problem, that it wasn't processing the graphics quickly enough (my on-board graphics worked better than with the card). It could have been the drivers which didn't load seamlessly or it could have been the card. No idea. I returned it which wasn't a problem but you lose a few dollars and a lot of time in the process. On the plus side when you contact PNY you talk to a real person. But they don't bend over backwards to help you. After I upgraded my power supply and was in the same position it was simply a matter of them suggesting it might be the card itself, return it to Amazon - and buy a more expensive and powerful card. The sad thing is, none of this surprises me."
4,Good bargain,"I've only had it for a couple of weeks and it's really helped my older machine. My only gripe is with the documentation. On my machine I had to go into safe mode and disable the on board driver, and I didn't see this in the documentation."
4,PNY Geforce FX5200 256MB PCI Graphics Card,"This product worked for me error-free thus far. Documentation was good and installed effortlessly.My old motherboard is non-AGP or PCI-E so this was just what I needed for a low-priced boost.Better PCI cards can be found, but is it worth it on a PCI bus which is limited in itself?I can run pretty advanced games like Armerica's Army 2.0 at pretty high resolutions and texture details with relative ease."
5,Great for the price,"Its a great graphics card, especially for the price. I got it to improve Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and it did. But the controls arent as clear as they could be for the anti-aliasing settings and the anisotropic filtering."
5,works great,"I bought this card for my Dell 2350 because I couldn't play some of the newest games and needed a PCI card. It works great and can now play games that couldn't before. It was a little tricky to setup, since the Dell motherboard has a built in graphics card. Yes, after following the directions it still didn't work - had to bootup with on-board card, then while running select the new card in the settings while running. Following the directions didn't work, but figured out after about 20 min. Great card for the price. All my games and programs work. I would buy again."
4,works well with most programs,"I purchased this to upgrade an HP mediacenter PC m1264n. It worked perfectly with Call of duty(2003) but had significant lag time withDelta Force Black Hawk down(2003) I was running w/ 3Gb memory. Although the water textures and lighting was perfect, aiming was almost like a half second delayed-making me a frequent KIA. Photos load quickly. Set-up was difficult since I had on-board video and needed a patch from the PNYwebsite but their tech support was quick and efficient(don't bother with HP customer support)OK for the cheap price. I think it is the best considering the old technology."
2,not recommended for vista 64-bit,I bought this for my machine which has Vista 64-bit. Every time the monitor came out of power saving mode blue screen would happen. The latest driver for Vista was created in 10/2006. Nvidia has no plans to release updates. I'm going to try to return this card.
3,Not 3.0 shader,"My computer is only a couple years old but already has an outdated video card. I bought this video card because it was the only ""PCI"" port (not PCI express) that I found anywhere that stated ""3.0 shader"" in the description - which you need to play some of the newer games. The card works great for my older and less demanding games but looks like I'll be getting a new computer to play the newer games."
5,"I am not a gamer, just practical, and this PCI card works","This graphics card fit my criteria perfectly.I am a very practical person. I have an old HP/Compaq D530 Convertible Minitower that I bought for around $100.00 two years ago from a refurbish company. I maxed out the RAM to 4GB and added an additional hard drive, and installed XP on it. It has been a very good computer.When Windows 7 came out, I upgraded it and only had one issue, with the old graphics card that would not support hardware acceleration. I started looking for a cheap PCI card that would resolve that issue. The retail stores wanted a lot more than what I paid for this one (and the ones that were close to the same price were brands I was not familiar with). This card snapped in and after installing the drivers from the CD and a reboot, it was working as promised.This home office computer should last me another two years, so I am very pleased. I like that it has two VGA outs so I can plug in another monitor if I decide to."
4,Easy as pie to install,"I'm not an expert techie but know how to install various cards and memory on a motherboard. Still I like to read the manual before delving right in to anything, even if it's something I'm familiar with. Well, honestly, all that reading was a waste of time. I basically stuck the card into the pci slot, hooked up all the necessary cables, turned on the PC and voila, both monitors were up and running without a hitch. Didn't even need the driver disc. This was on an XP machine.I want to add that I may have gotten a used/refurbished card. I am certainly sure that the driver disc was used because there were several scratches on it. I'm questioning the newness of the video card because one of the stickers had pen writing on it. But the thing works like a charm and I did register for an extra two years of warranty."
5,Great Dual Monitor cards,The dual monitor cards worked great and my customer was very pleased. Bought them for 2 Dell Optiplex 320's and they were exactly what I needed.
1,Don't buy anything PNY..,"Let me start by stating that I'm a Sysadmin for a medium sized network. In addition to that, I've assembled hundreds of PC's. I purchased and installed this card without issue. The unit worked for a little over a week before it began crashing to a black screen. Once the card was removed and the original configuration was restored, the machine was back up with no issues. The vendor would not provide an RMA but directed me directly to PNY and so began an email dance back and forth with generic trouble shooting info that didn't apply to the card. After several attempts to get an RMA, and continuing to get more ""help"" I finally gave up and threw the card away. Having dealt with many RMA's over the years, I'm amazed how unresponsive this vendor is. I will never use any PNY product for home or work."
1,Awful...,I picked this card up because I wanted to clone my monitor via s-video. This card has performed terribly with my Vista OS. The screen flickers no matter what refresh rate I try. It also creates crackles in my sound. Avoid this card if you are using Vista!
1,TOTALLY USELESS!!!,"I have a fairly new machine and wanted to turn it into a media center so I bought this card. The box claimed that it supported Vista but it doesn't work for me so I popped in a different drive to install XP with MCE. That process does not solve the problem either. The video jiggered after a few minutes after every power on or reboot.Giving it a benifit of a doubt, I installed the new drivers (Vista and XP) from their website to see what happen. BAD IDEA!!! Both Vista and XP got blue screen and while loop of reboot. After uninstalling this problem card and its driver, both Vista and XP are (no media center, but...) working fine now."
5,Good reading,"I'm not a historian or history major, but I found this book to be a good introduction, and yet more valuable than just an introduction.(I kept this kind of vague to avoid spoiling it) Manning explained the economics of slavery's from its beginning and why it contributed to its end (abolitionist too). He wasn't lieing to the readers by portraying all Africans as all naiive victims... Manning clearly points out how slavery decimated Africa economically and helped create an African identity."
4,Insightful yet boring,"This book is insightful and is based on evidence, but unlike most history novels it contains many diagrams, maps and graphs that complicate Manning's thesis, rather than clarifying it. The book is repetitive and dry while at the same time introducing new ideas. This book taught me about African culture and the economics behind the worldwide African slave trade, but it did so in an impersonal manner; it was general, not leaning on specific cases."
1,Disapointed!,"The camera initially showed much promise. Very easy to use; while it worked (for a brief period) good quality, sharp video in bright as well as indoor, low lighting. The built in light is great.The bad: With my first tape, a new Panasonic DV tape, intial playback showed banding and video brakeup. This was recorded on the tape. Thirty minutes into the first tape, a sign appeared in the view finder indication that the tape heads were dirty and had to be cleaned. Sorry but returned the camera and will have to look for another brand."
1,Indoor filming s[tinks],"The film quality is great under outdoor lighting, but embarassingly poor indoors as it looks worst than my 8 year old Hi-8. Typical grainy display that is common in all RCA junk."
2,Insert Head Cleaner message all the time,"First 2 tapes came out fine, from there on I constantly receive the ""Insert Head Cleaner"" message no matter what I do to clean the heads! Turning the camera off and on again will clear the error message but now only 50% of footage is viewable. Wish I was within 90 day warranty period still!"
5,Excellent and complete introduction.,"At the time of this writing, this is easily the best introduction to the GIMP. It covers about 90% of the material in the GIMP for Linux Bible, but the explanations are more concise. I would recommend the other book only if you need coverage of scripting, which this Quickstart doesn't really have."
5,One outstanding novel on the insanity of war,"This book belongs in the same category as ""All quiet on the western front"" by Remarque. It conveys very vividly the suffering of simple soldiers in the sort of inhuman carnage the first world war stands for. It is very well readable in its style but the contents are hard to digest."
4,A desperate fight...,"A different approach in the search of pleasure. The incensant search for meaning to achieve individuality. In short, a fantastic, though, antagonistic crossbreed amongst them. Existence and death to numb loneliness at its best... Highly recomended!"
1,Terrible Hockey Tape,I purchased 10 rolls of this for my hockey season and it is terrible. I wrapped my goal stick and not fifteen minutes later the tape is peeling off. I am not sure if I have a defective product or this product is just bad but I am not going to recomment it to anyone. I have purchased tape in the past from GreatSkate.com and it has served me excellently but this tape is just of poor quality.
3,Not too thrilled,I've used multiple types of tape for multiple types of hockey. Currently I am playing deck (foot) hockey. This has been pretty bad tape. Functionally it works great. It cushions the ball and helps me control it. The problem is that it peels off REALLY easy. That was enough for it to love 2 stars with me.
4,Nice tape,"This tape is good for the grip, but tape it right or else it starts to peel off at the blade with enough contact with puck and surface."
2,Erratic quality at best,"I purchased several rolls last year and have had disappointing results. Tapes I've used in the past have been 'wrap and go,' requiring no touch-ups or attention after the initial application. This has not been the case with these rolls, however. While the tape from one or two rolls has stayed put moderately well (but requiring occasional re-smoothing), tape from other rolls in the same order has loosened and started to unwrap almost immediately. I have a couple of rolls I haven't used yet and I don't like that I have no idea what the adhesive qualities of those rolls will be."
2,"Thin, weak, very poor quality","This is not normal stick tape. The color is great and it's fine for the grips, but useless for the blade. I'm not even sure how it can be called stick tape. Would love it if it was the normal thickness."
4,"OK, Not Great","Overly Dramatic like most Italian Movies. Titillatingly Suggestive material does not have the impact I would expect from this topic. Moves very slow, trying to build interest. Many people gave this high reviews. I say BULLCOOKIES. Needs less Nebulous Drama, and more Direct Substance."
2,"Big, bulky and heavy","The flash and it's support arm look somewhat sleezy, and the bad part is that both the flash and the grip require 4 batteries each, making the total quite heavy. Now I wish I had purchased the Canon proprietary flash instead."
4,Reiko and Pat,"Pat and Reiko form an equal partnership in this story. Eric Farnham returns to the Monterey Peninsula after a three year absence. Eric has a background as an enforcer for the mob but he is now interested in finding the missing fortune of the deceased queen of Northern California rackets, Felicia Montalvo. For that reason he hires Pat and Reiko. There are a lot of pleasures in reading this series, but probably one of the most enjoyable is watching the developing relationship between Reiko and Pat."
5,Helpful and beautiful,"This deck of cards is the most elegant, simple, helpful tool. They were introduced to me by a close friend whose psychologist recommended them. To use them I put them in three piles:1) I don't feel that2) I kind of feel that3) I feel that stronglyEvery time that I use them I walk away with more inner peace! I highly recommend them!!"
2,Ok...,The idea of this product is awesome but since it only has adhesive on two sides my daughter very easily figured out how to tear it off.
1,Don't waste your money!,We tried these after getting one of the portable mats that didn't work out. This item too didn't work for us. It won't stick it there is a table cloth. Then 9 time out of 10 when we would get it stuck our daughter would pull it up with one hand! It really ended up being more trouble than it was worth.We started carrying a package of cleaning wipes in her bag...we wipe down her part of the table really well and let her have at it. At 14 months she doesn't really make too much of a mess and if she does we just had an extra couple of bucks for a tip and apologize for the mess on the way out.
5,Magnificent!,"This game is GORGEOUS!! It has some of the best graphics on the PSP I've ever seen!! The gameplay is fun, the music is good. It has fully voiced movie sequences. So, all-in-all it is a great game!"
5,Kingdom of Paradise is great!,"This game is a great game! With tons of replay value! I was checking out this game on Toysrus.com, and i saw that if you buy it from them, you get a free code... well thats dumb, since you can get the codes for free...Just type in these codes to get your free downloads:[codes] > > > > > [download]ptiuquc > > > > > Byakko Kenpu 31*qucmtkb > > > > > Kirin Kenpu 31*kakeiti > > > > > Seiryu Kenpu 31*myuicei > > > > > Suzaku Kenpu 31*jticgek > > > > > Seima Braceletotkciet > > > > > Seima Hair Pinxktmvut > > > > > Seima Ringaietmaw > > > > > Seima Ankletrkjulvj > > > > > Miracle Sword - Attack +14...so, if you really want this game, get it from EB Games, or Circuit City... but please do not buy into Toysrus's ""gimic""."
5,A masterpiece of RPG on PSP,"The graphic is fine, sharp 3D and most backgrounds are brillantand bright. The music is nice, it must be highlighted thatmost of key dialgoues are dubbed in clear, loud sound, notonly in text for tired reading.The plot is straighforward, the difficulty is just all right.you will not get frustrated, but only not get boring. As youare playing, the vivid graphic and sound is really a charmingenjoyment.The game is deep enough for you to improve your skills, setupyour own combe styles of sword-slash and build up 'chi' spellsfor powerful casting........Anyway, this should be the BEST RPG for psp so far !!!!"
3,Eh,"I'm surprised by all of the great reviews for this game. It does have nice graphics, but I found it lacking in many ways. I found the fighting to be boring and very repetitive. Yes I could come up with new combos, but for the most part it was button mashing against the same enemies over and over until the stage ending boss. The dialog cut scenes were aggravating. There is no way to skip it, so if you die right after one, you have to go back and watch it all over again. This one just wasn't fun for me."
1,severe problems with Tiger 10.4,"after numerous attempts to get this to work, emails that were not responded to by Delkin customer support, I eventually gave up with this thing. I got it primarily for the Sony Memory Stick capability, got a better solution with the USB Memory stick reader directly from Sony Site."
2,Still Thinking ABout It,"A beautifully written book with characters that are at once compelling and incredibly annoying. After a very positive start, particularly the interweaving of Emily Dickinson poetry, the book just labored. The book's setting, a valley which was to be flooded by the government, could have lent itself to a more insightful story of home, roots, family...instead we get a touch of incest and some frustrated men.Overall, I was disapointed ..I expected better after a strong start and would have appreciated a flood midway through"
3,what does this product suppose to do?,"warning for those that have never used AHA before/sensitive skin, it STINGS! putting it on for the first time, and even continue to use it for 3+ weeks, i still feel a burning sensation every time I put this on my face. for first-time user of AHA, definitely recommend a lower concentration. 3+ weeks of using it, do not notice a difference... (skin tone has probably? lightened up a bit?) Use sunscreen in daytime is a must."
5,Excellent acne prevention,"I've been using this product for a couple of years. It's the best treatment I've found for preventing spots, which I get a lot when not using it. I use it twice a day. It contains glycolic acid, whereas most acne prevention treatments you can buy over the counter have salycylic acid as the active ingredient. I recently forgot to put it in my hold baggage for a flight and it was confiscated from my hand luggage, so I had to go for a while without any before I could get another order in. Sure enough, after about 3 days my spots started reappearing. I recommend it for that reason."
2,what happened?!,"worked for 2 weeks to make my skin smoother and softer, then stopped working all together."
3,Cool Pulp Novel,"I bought this book because I loved the cover!Easy to read, well written and short. I haven't finished it, though, haven't had the time. It is definitely not a page-turner, but it is cute and if you want a non-disappointing easy reading, I would recommend it."
4,A lefty Classic,"I had been looking at Invicta watches for sometime (I was intriqued by the large sizes) but just happened to stumble upon these left-handed versions. I love the fact that the stem and pushers are on the right side of the dial - I can now adjust the time without having to remove the watch from my right wrist. This watch is huge, so be forwarned. It can interfere with shirt cuffs, and the watch is so large that the stem can actually leave a mark in the top of my hand. All in all, however, this is a great time piece. It's very handsome, the blue/purple dial is beautiful, and it's very accurate. The contrast between the dial color and the rich brown band is stunning. You'll be sure to get a lot of positive comments."
4,Perfect for relaxing or meditating,"This cd is perfect for relaxing and meditation. When I can't sleep, this cd is perfect for calming my mind and chilling out. I absolutely love the sound of the sitar as it is my favorite instrument, and the sound is top notch. My only complaint would be that it has a little too much synth sounds for my taste, I would prefer a more pure sitar sound, but that's just my taste. It is a really good cd, and I recommend it to anyone who likes Indian music."
5,Wonderful music!,"This is the most satisfying and soothing sitar music I could find on Amazon. I will keep looking for more, but I know that this album will always be the standard by which I measure other sitar and Indian music. It's perfect."
1,Trash compass DO NOT BUY FOR ANY REASON!!!,"This miserable excuse for a product is made from thin, soft plastic and therefore bends when tracing, making it ineffective as a compass. Also, there is a soft plastic point instead of a proper needle, so of course it slips significantly and dulls quickly when tracing,additionally increasing the uselessness of this product. Buying this would only be a waste of money and time, a small child doesn't even deserve something so shoddily made. There is no reason at all to buy this. Spend a little more on a proper metal compass and don't waste your money."
4,Jake Johnson the Story of a Mule,"Being a retired teacher I enjoy returning to the classroom to read to children. I read many of Tres Seymour's book. We laugh at the efforts made to get Jake to move. We like Mrs Pucket's new hat. And we always wonder if Jake is ""...still sitting on the court house square."""
2,Don't bother,"I needed this for Win 98 and it worked great. Now with Vista it is unnecessary, plus it was bundled with a new HP printer package. So if you need it great, but check your computer's apps before you spend any money on it. It's kinda outdated now."
5,Give me more!,"This is the best show Fox ever produced. I'm thankful to have this little bit of Bernie Mac and look forward to the release of all the other seasons. If you're looking for a good laugh, Bernie never dissappoints!!!"
3,Nice mat but but too soft,This is a thick and good looking mat but it is far too soft and the covering is too lose to be effective.
3,Not Quite What It Seems,"I was expecting something more robust.The promo shows a fabric taught and tight over firm foam, but in reality, the fabric is somewhat loose and puckered.Cover has a plastic feel that seems like the type to crack at edges in the not too distant future.Foam is composite and not as firm as I had hoped. NOT suited for high impact training, such as Judo.It really has a Made In China feel to it. Which it was.The person complaining above about weigh and height must be a effete midget, as the mats folded are less than four feet and very lightweight. I'm not big and I tote this easily one handed.If you want something durable and for life, get a heavier grade gymnastics mat. This is suitable for portability."
2,Too heavy - Handles Do NOT Make This Mat 'Easily Transportable',"The mat appears to be good quality, and the padding is certainly thick enough. However, the web site is somewhat misleading because the extremely heavy weight of this product is not listed, while the handles are promoted in a way that gives the (mis)impression that this would not be a difficult item to move. It IS a difficult item to move. In the pictured folded state, the mat is taller than I am - not easily stored, and certainly not easy to transport. The handles are attached, but are a joke if you really want to be able to even lug this thing across your living room. This WOULD be a good product for a home gym if you plan to lay the mat out in a set location and leave it in place. If you're looking for a comfortable mat that you can store between uses - keep looking. I suggest choosing a mat that lists it's actual weight and size when folded/stored."
4,"Decent price, good product","This item was ordered, shipped and delivered in a prompt easy fashion. It's pretty much what it says it is and works just fine. It may be a bit bulky but that can't be helped since it is a larger size (area) mat.Overall, I was happy with the price and product."
4,Christmas Banjo tunes,"Will take a while to evaluate since I've just begun to learn the instrument. word, word, word, word, word, word, word,"
4,Solid Christmas Banjo Book,"This book has all the major songs you would expect, and typically in 3 different versions: melody, beginner 3 finger, and intermediate 3 finger. Some are Scruggsy some are more melodic, all in all a good mix. The instructional CD is very good and gives an overview of what you are trying to play.There are no amazing licks or crazy compositions, but it does its job as a solid Christmas Banjo Book."
5,Brings color to your cube,Bought these cubicle hangers to bring color to my cube. I was tired of the plain white hooks or the T-pins. They seem sturdy and really do look nice.
5,Great cubicle solution,These cubicle clips are a great solution for holding papers on cubicle partitions. Plus they are colorful and inexpensive.
5,Great Workout!,I am an avid runner and like intensity. This video does it! It gave a great core and upper body work-out while at the same time lengthening all those tight muscles. I walked away feeling relaxed and tone. It also is easy to adapt to different levels so you can notch it up or notch it down to match where you are at. Well worth the money!!
2,"Looks good, but slow and linear","Not bad, but not too fun in my opinion. Diablo look, 3rd person view. Very linear quest line, not many options. Very slow paced and a lot of leg work. Looks good and has interesting story, but I didnt complete chapter 2, it was just too tedius."
2,bit of a rip off,"This review goes for all the four box sets. I, for one, cannot see the point in all these pointless remixes. Once you have heard the song, fine...what I think would have been better would be to collect a double album of all erasure's B-sides. That would be more comprehensive and interesting, rather than 100 remixes of 'breath of life' for example."
4,karaoke 50's songs,"Good song selection,most songs like orig.some not so much.very quick responce.all in all I'm satisfied.Merry Christmas to all,& good night."
5,Beautiful easy projects for kids & adults!,"The projects in this book are all fun and also nice to look at. Unlike some kids' projects, these are things I wouldn't mind having around my house!I checked the book out from the library and had it for a whole year before I realized I should buy myself a copy."
1,Incompatible with Australian DVD players!,Please be aware when purchasing DVDs for Australian players...they are not compatible. I had a very disappointed 4 year old and had to return the product. More information should be provided for international buyers!
5,Fraggles are awesome.,I loved the Fraggles as a child and have since seen them with little children and they still hold up and grab the imagination of both young and old.
4,missing some stuff,"I bought the Fraggle Rock first season. It came on time, but there was no paper information in the actual cd case... And the first cd skipped a little. A little disappointed."
2,CD ROM,"I got my first season of Fraggle Rock from Amazon.com today and I love it!! The only thing I wanted to mention is that amazon.com's version does not include the cd rom with the fun fraggle stuff. I'm still happy, just wish I had that too."
5,Starting a new obsession,Well I wasn't going to get it but in the end my will power wasn't stong enough against the power of the muppets. If you adore the muppets like I do then get this its fantastic.
4,family fun for everyone,"this is a well put together season set. the packaging is a tad annoying to close, but the disks are colorful and contain one of the best kids shows ever put out. there is a nifty bonus of the notepad used by jim henson to concieve of this kiddo friendly show. for uber geeks like me that is a big treat. my 3 year old loves fraggle rock and so do i!"
5,Fraggle Rock,"My childern loved this program when they were young, and now my grandchildern will be able to watch it also. The quality is very good, and Jim Henderson is a hard act to follow. I recommend this DVD set to anyone that is looking for good childern's entertainment."
4,"Ahhh, memories!","I remember watching Fraggle Rock on HBO when it first aired. As a kid I loved The Muppet Show, so I figured that a new show by Jim Henson would be worth watching. I haven't seen the show in years, so when I saw it was out on DVD I had to add it to the collection. The only drawback is when you watch this or The Muppet Show or even old Sesame Street (Old School rocks!) you really see how crappy kids TV has become and how bad the whole Muppet franchise has become after the death of Jim Henson. Disney has ruined the magic that Henson created. I plan on showing this and The Muppet show to my kids so they can experience good TV. Sesame Street has become one big Elmo sales pitch and the educational aspects have been dumbed down. Very sad."
4,Sound and Picture Not Great But I Still Enjoyed It,"The sound and picture are not great but that is to be expected I guess. I purchased the dvd set for my son because I loved it so much as a kid myself. He is not into it, either too focused on Postman Pat or too young (he is only one). Anyway I love it and have enjoyed watching them again. If you were a Fraggle Rock fan I would recommend to you to buy it."
5,watching this just took 20 years off my life. this stuff is superb.,"sure I too grew up on the fraggles, but what I forgot about these funny little creatures is how easily they relate to me, and to you others i'm sure. there's so many different levels of humor in the fraggles, that anyone from a child to a elderly person can enjoy watching them. Truthfully I think now that I'm older (and with a BA in film production) the fraggles are even MORE enjoyable to watch than they used to be! Even if you're on a budget, try to get the cash for this box set. The digital mastering is the best it can be, considering what technology was used to originally make these little gems of entertainment. The packaging is excellent, and Jim Henson's included notepad reproduction is an interesting bonus."
5,The Best,"I've watched Peggy's video's and also taken a few of Peggy's classes in person. I'm not sure what the problem is with the other opinion written on Peggy, but I can vouch for her that her video's are all well-thought out, and explained in a methodical and logical way. I can always follow her instruction and I've learned so much from her. Peggy has industry experience and a degree in fashion and design, as well as having her own business. I trust her explicitly, she is an excellent speaker and teacher. I posted this because I'm buying ANOTHER one of her video's and saw a crummy post on her, and thought it was unfair.My Very Best Dressed ME!"
2,LA City Lights sounds like a copy from a vinyl record,"Has anyone else noticed that the LA City Lights song sounds as if it's a vinyl record with all of the pops and scratches you'd expect from that medium? In this digital age, I did not expect the poor sound quality. I like this song, but I hate the sound quality."
5,"Easy listening,,,great for writing","I discovered this amazing jazz artist when a co-worker put in a CD, while we were at work. I immediately fell in love with Candy's great sound. If you like Boney James and Paul Hardcastle, you'll love Candy Store by Candy Dulfer.Candy Store"
1,Candy Store? Hmm..,"Hated this one. Candy, go back to your roots. This isn't much more than rap, with a gratuitous sax note or two thrown in for credibility, but it failed miserably. Anyone want my copy?"
4,Become a Poetry Slam Junkie,"I was very excited to see this movie in the theater last year, since for the last several years I have been a real fan of poetry slams, but there aren't that many around that I'm aware of. This movie provided an excellent sample of the electric excitement of words honed to a fine art and then zapped with the energy of performance. I wished the movie had been twice as long! Now I'm buying it to pass along to skeptical friends to turn them into poetry slam junkies too."
2,Not for School,I'd hoped to show this video in the classroom to my high school students but the sexual references are way too graphic. Bummer.
5,well a title in english would help wouldn't it?,"OK I had no idea what this was so I just bit the bullet and invested.....when I opened it up I found to my suprise that it was ""planet of the wolves"" the japanese release. it even says planet of the wolves in englisgh on the front so a translation wouldn't have been to hard!....anyway the album is fantastic as ever, it comes with an extra track which isn't on anything else as far as I am aware.the interesting thing is, if like me you have this CD on matador, you will have presumed that the awful quality pixilated images on the back and with in the booklet were there for some low-fi cool, well no matador just screwed it up, the original pressing has great high grade images printed in black and silver like the jet generation matador CD.well what can I say had I known I was only buying it for one track would I have still gone for it? absolutely I am that much of a loser! ..."
1,Not Waterproof!,"I bought this mattress pad to protect a brand new set of mattresses that I purchased. I laundered according to the directions once before placing it on the mattress. Thank God I also wrapped the top mattress with a Sleep Tite mattress encasement, because my son dropped a cup of warm chocolate milk on his bed and it went right through the new Simmons Beautyrest Cotton Blend Waterproof with Laminate Mattress cover and the Sleep Tite stopped it from hitting the mattress. I DON'T recommend this crumby product."
1,Terrible,"While the pad it self seems to be of good quality, the elastic on the side is terrible. The elastic sides rip repeatedly while trying to put in on the mattress, thereby making it useless to stay on the mattress. I have owned numerous other mattress pads in my life & this one is the absolute worst!"
4,Does the job,"I ordered this mattress pad for my guest bedroom....my father in law was visiting with his old, incontinent dog who sleeps with him and I wanted to protect the mattress from any possible accidents. Well there was an accident and the mattress pad did it's job....the mattress was not damaged at all. The only negative I have is that after washing and drying the mattress pad, the plastic seems to have shrunk while the cloth cover did not which leave a bubble of fabric when making the bed. Not a big deal, but I thought I'd mention it.Something else I'd like to mention is that I have had other mattress pads like this and sleeping on them was hot. But this one feels no different than a regular mattress pad so i've left it on the bed for normal use."
5,Works great...,"Decided to get this to protect the new foam mattress I bought, especially since our 2 year old climbs into bed a lot. She wet the bed once and then two other times the dog got mad at us and decided to use our bed as the bathroom. Through all of this the mattress pad has protected our mattress and made clean up from these annoying little accidents an absolute sinch!"
1,Bad Fit,Do not order one of these ! the elastic does not hold it on the mattress and it pulls up during the night and makes your sheets bunch up. I sent mine back !!!!
4,Good mattress pad,"The mattress pad was good quality...fits nicely and added just enough ""fluff: to the mattress! I would recommend this product."
1,Ripped before I could use it!,"I purchased 2 of these mattress pads: one directly from Amazon and the other from an outside vendor. The skirt of the mattress pad ripped as I was putting it on the bed the first time. I returned it to the outside vendor and received a refund. The vendor acknowledged that the manufacturer had sent out a bad batch. I've also returned the other mattress pad to Amazon, even though it hasn't ripped yet and hoping for a refund. The quality of the top is OK, but the skirt is papery and inferior."
1,Returned this protector,"I read the positive reviews here and was hopeful, but the very first time I tried to put this on a mattress, the side ripped. I returned it. They are cheaply made and the sides are not strong, nor are they deep enough for deeper-sized mattresses."
2,Poor quality,"After one wash & dry, the strechy sides split at each of the elastic pieces, basically leaving me with just a pad. Poor quality as far a durability, but it does keep the mattress dry."
4,Just what we ordered,"Very happy with the purchase. We wanted waterproof pads for our toddler beds. Seem, very comfy. Fit well. Havent tested the waterproof part but i am sure it is better than nothing. Great price compared to others i have looked at."
5,Great!,"This mattress pad has worked very well for us. We put it on our 3 year old son's first ""big boy bed"". It washes and dries flawlessly. No discernible ""crinkly"" sounds come from it. We are very pleased."
2,Held up for about a year,"We got this mattress pad about a year ago. It gets washed about twice a month, and after about a year, it has shrank horribly and no longer adequately fits the bed. I'm now on amazon buying a new one, and it won't be this one. I'm giving it two stars because the top is cushy and adds comfort to the bed - but as far as durability, I'd give it 1 star."
2,crazy hard to get on,"We got this for my 4 yo's new bunk bed since he still has occasional accidents at night. Oh my. My husband put it on the first time and said it was hard, but I thought he was just exaggerating. I honestly spent 30-45 min. today trying to get the blasted thing on after having washed and dried it for only the second time. Granted, everything's more challenging with a bunk bed, but I got the regular sheet on in about 3 min. I am honestly thinking of putting him back in pullups so I don't have to deal with washing and changing it when he has accidents!!! It did do a good job of acting as a barrier and I didn't have pee cascading on me when I took it off his bed. **UPDATE: I originally gave this 3 stars, but the next time washing it, the expandable part totally ripped as we were trying to put it on the bed and was rendered useless. My husband was not yanking hard on it or anything. So, after about 2 weeks and 3 washes it was done for."
5,Very comfortable and warm!,"I use it to a regular twin size mattress in dormitary. It fits very well and give nicely sleep.It's very soft, not as hard as I first saw it. Makes my dormitory more like home."
2,Simmons???,It rips way too easy!!!!! It rips along the seem of the outer part. I expected more from Simmons. Buyer beware!!!
1,Does not meet expectations,"After a single wash, the fitted section ripped while putting the mattress pad on our bed. Also, unlike other reviewers, we have found that after washing, this product does hold a lot of water in it, making the drying process tedious and messy."
2,Cheap,"The top seemed okay, but there were slits along the sides, like cuts. The package they came in was fine so I'm sure they were done during manufacturing. Very cheaply made. Definatly not worth the price. Have returned them."
2,Terrible quality - ripped the day I bought it.,"This thing ripped the day I bought it putting it on the mattress - such a rip off! The only reason I'm giving it two stars is that my daughter has wet the bed about 3 times and it's kept the mattress dry, so I'll give it that much. That said, I'm sure I'll need a new one in a matter of months because every time I wash it and have to put it back on it rips even more - it barely even covers the mattress now. Total waste of money."
5,Simmons Beautyrest Waterproof Cover,"I ordered two of these from Amazon, one for each of my sons beds. My husband and I have the king size one on our bed and love it. I have washed it many times and it is still in like new condition. It has saved my mattress many times with the kids either being sick or having leaking diapers. When they got their ""big boy beds"" last month, the first thing I did was order these mattress pads for their beds. The comfort level of this product is great. I was a little apprehensive when we first got the one for our bed, thinking that it would have a plastic feel or just be uncomfortable. However, I can't tell any difference between this waterproof cover and standard cotton only covers. I would highly recomend this product."
5,Works Perfectly!,"I got this for my 3 year old and his new big boy bed. He is still learning to get up and go potty on his own at night, so he has at least a couple accidents a week. We have never had a leak soak through to the mattress. Also, I've washed this mattress pad so many times and it has held up great. It doesn't take long to dry either. I would definitely recommend!!"
3,Won't stay on,"The mattress pad is comfortable, but keeps pulling off of the corners and sides during the night, leaving the mattress edges unprotected. Plus it's a pain to make the bed in the morning, as you have to remove the fitted sheet. Mattress 13"" deep, so I can only imagine the problems with a thicker mattress. Will try another brand."
5,Best cover I have had,This cover fit perfect. I ordered the California King. Was waterproof and washed well. I highly recommend.
4,So Far So Good,"Bought this mattress cover to protect our new (very expensive) Simmons Beautyrest NXG mattress. Since any soiling or staining of the mattress will void the Simmons warranty, this was a necessary purchase. It's not too difficult to get on the mattress. The fit is pretty good but, not as tight as I would like it to be so, there is a little ""poofing"" on top. The comfort is fine. We don't notice any crinkling noises, due to the laminate. We haven't had any ""accidents"" so I can't speak for the effectiveness of the waterproofing. So... so far so good."
2,Shapeless Shifty Mess,"This mattress pad is apparently oversized for a standard queen bed. The skirt does not stay tucked in and the top bunches up and slides all over the bed. Quality appears to be excellent, especially on the skirt (not one of those useless tear-easy paper skirts!) but the fit is really bad!"
5,"Seriously, The best I have found","Stays Put!Washes Easily without holding in a ton of water like other brands do!Not noisy at all.Seriously, the best. Now that I found one that works great for my daughter, I plan on buying one for my our bed too!"
1,Ripped the day I open this,I bought this to put on my queen bed after my father-in-law moved out. Opened it up and ripped trying to put it on. Piece of junk.
3,waterproof but won't stay in place,"We purchased this mattress cover shortly after purchasing our Beautyrest mattress, which the sales associate at Sleepys informed us would no longer be under its 10 year warranty if there were any stains or discoloration (including sweat stains, our primary concern as summer was fast approaching). I agree with the other reviewers that the cotton layer keeps the bed cool and comfortable while also providing a nice bit of padding. Unfortunately, it does not fit our queen size mattress well, despite never having been washed. At any given time one corner will be pulling off the mattress, despite our best efforts to keep it taut. This is surprising to us because the mattress does not have unusual dimensions and is the same brand as the mattress pad."
1,Complete Waste of Your Money,"If you don't catch the leak/spill immediately, you're completely out of luck. I found this out the hard way. The only thing this mattress pad protects is Simmons' profit margin.Additionally, it is very hot and sweaty -- not comfy by any means, though at least it isn't loud.I hope someone benefits from my negative experience with this product.To solve the leakage problem: I put the $40 towards a microfiber base layer that is guaranteed against liquids, and a foam or fluffy merino mattress topper for coolness and comfort. So far, so good!"
5,Completely satisfied,"I looked at slightly less expensive pads but ultimately decided on this one for both my bed and my toddler's bed; I wanted something that could withstand milk spills, leaky diapers, etc. (and thus frequent washing). I have had the pads for about two months now and am more than satisfied -- they are high quality, easy to wash and dry, and supremely comfortable. The webbing on the sides is very strong - stretchable, no tearing. I highly recommend this product!"
3,"Works well, not too comforable","These types of straps are really great for knee pain when you've got a kneecap that doesn't want to slide into it's groove right. This is a very nice quality strap that has a soft lining that feels good against the skin. It's also a great bargain compared to some of its competitors.Unfortunately, the way it straps on is not comfortable for me at all. Basically, you thread the strap through a buckle and then it fastens down with Velcro. In order for this strap to work, it has to assert a little pressure against the bottom of the kneecap, but doing so pushes the plastic buckle into my skin. It pinches when I bend my knee.As a side note, I also bought McDavid Jumper's Knee Strap and found it to be VERY comfortable. With the McDavid strap, there is no buckle. It simply wraps around the leg using Velcro. It's lining is soft and I can wear it for long periods of time with no discomfort or other problems at all."
5,It gets me to Half Dome and back,"This is a well made product in the U.S.A. (woohoo!) I wore this to Half Dome and back and it kept my knee pain to the minimum. I also like the side that's touching your skin; it's made of soft felt material instead of the neoprene material, like Mueller Jumper's Knee Strap and McDavid Jumper's Knee Strap, which cause excessive sweating where it contacts the skin. I also noticed the pressure-strip is smaller and more flexible than the other brands so it fits below the knee cap better. The buckle problem mentioned by the previous reviewer is not a problem with me because there's an extension of the felt material below the buckle that separates and cushions the skin from the buckle and you just have to pull the extension to position it correctly. Last of all, you can't beat the Amazon's two-pack price and fast delivery."
5,They work!,I purchased these for my 13 year old daughter who was experiencing knee pain from soccer practice. They have been very helpful in reducing that pain by stabilizing her knee caps. The price at Amazon is the best anywhere.
1,Don't buy. Will Waste your money,Most all iPods do not support fireWire transfers. It will only charge your iPod; nothing else. You won't be able to transfer songs or use your iPod in disk mode. I just wasted about 10 bucks to be disappointed!
4,Durable,The arm is a neat gimmick. What I really like is the size and the kind of plastic it is made of. You must be able to read through it and you can. The plastic though is not that brittle crud that will break if you look at wrong. I really think this will make it through the school year.
4,not kid friendly,"My kids were learning to find angles with a protractor. Most practice questions had angles with short legs, limited by the printable space, and kids had hard time extending the sides of the angle so the angle can be read. Most protractors have a space in the middle so the short sides must be manually extended.The swing arm is a great idea. That gets 5 stars. However, this protractor makes it difficult to line up the vertex point and a side. The point has to be approximated because of the hinge for the swing arm, and the spaced lines are not easy to line up with the angle's side.Still, this is only protractor I found that even tries to help the kids with lining up the sides."
2,Item as listed,Snoopy was packed well and shipped quick. Nice addition to other ornaments in this year group. Would recommend for the price paid
4,Excellent book,"I'm about half way through it now, but it's already solved a couple of problems I've had with SpamAssassin. Book is packed with tools and resources. Kudos to the authors!"
5,Bunn fan for Life,"I was having issues with my previous coffee pot--it would always make coffee which has a burnt taste to it. After doing research on coffee makers, I found out that the burnt taste was due to having having an inconsistent water temperature during the brewing process. I found out that the Bunn coffee makers were designed in such a way that the water temperature is accurate and consistent. As a result, the Bunn produces the most consistent and best tasting cup of coffee ever! As stated in other reviews, you do have to leave the coffee pot always plugged in to keep the water heated. Water is stored in a heating reservoir in order to ensure a consistent water temperature through the brewing process. If you choose to unplug the coffee pot, you will have to wait 15 minutes for the water in the reservoir to be heated to the proper temperature before the 3 min brewing cycle proceeds. That being said, I highly recommend this coffee pot and I will never depart from Bunn."
3,excellent while it worked,"Our 4 person office used this machine to make coffee a couple times a week, and to warm water for tea daily. It was used, but not in extreme excess. I have no complaints about the coffee maker for the first 3 years (while its under warranty), it made great coffee & was convenient for heating water as well. BUT...none of that matters now because after 3 years & 2 months...it does not work at all. One morning it just decided it was done. Now I am searching for a longer lasting product."
2,Coffee comes out not strong,"I bought this for our office of 25 employees. I bought this based on the positive review and that it is a quality, durable product. The complete brewing process was fast as advertised. However, the coffee that came out into the decanter was light brown water. And it tasted like brown water. It was not dark like normal coffee. Maybe because it was a High Altitude brewer and we are not in high altitude? I picked it for the office because it says ""Commercial"" brewer. For the cost of it I expected better tasting coffee. I returned it and bought two Mr.Coffee,the switch model, from Target for half the cost. The office is happy now."
1,Do not buy BUNN equipment,"A cautionary tale for those people considering buying a BUNN product:I purchased a BUNN Granita machine from Bunn on May 23, 2012. One week after receiving it, one side stopped working. I took it to the repair guy *assuming* that it would be covered by the warrantee as it had only worked for a week. BUNN declined to fixed the machine, so I ended up having to get it fixed for an additional $320 charge.DO NOT BUY PRODUCTS FROM BUNN - THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS. IF IT BREAKS - YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER MANUFACTURERS OF COMMERCIAL MACHINES - GO WITH THEM INSTEAD."
1,"This coffee pot is a piece of junk,","lasted 4 weeks long enough for warranty to run out, cheaply made, leaked continuly, coffee door wouldn't stay shut, have have pots last forever till I finally threw out, wow those days are over"
1,As good as any cheap coffee makers,"You go for the name,Bunn, pay many times more than cheaper brands, that you can get from K mart or home improvement centers but get no better coffee than a $30 Mr. Coffee or B&D. Shame on Bunn for making and sellin this ""brewer""."
5,The Best,This is a great coffee maker for home & office use. It starts brewing instantly as there is water kept hot in the internal tank. This water is replaced every time you pour water for your current pot in the top. So a second or two after you close the top lid the water starts coming through the basket. The flavor produced is better than all the rest because of the consistent temp of the water flowing through the grounds. The only worry i have is how much this is going to affect my electric bill.
1,poor working,"I ordered a professional which turned out not to be a professional. The coffee brews luke warm. I place it in the microwave for 40-50 seconds to reach my temp. A warning is you use twice the coffee of a conventional drip pot. With the cost of coffee, that should be kept in mind for a potential buyer. I have had many Bunns throughout the years and this is cleaply. There is no more carafe for measuring water nor a scoop for measuring coffee . We are seriously preparing to dump this pot and go back to our Cuisinart. We didn't need a new pot, just wanted a new pot. Quality control sucks with this one."
1,Total Disappintment,"I purchased this coffee maker because I wanted hot temperature and fast brew. It might have a decent temp and it is fast but everything else is terrible. I use gourmet coffee and I like it strong, so I us a lot. Usually 2 tablespoons per cup. The brew basket only holds maybe 15 tablespoons if you are lucky, which is about 7 or 8 cups. You cannot make a full pot unless you want weak coffee. If you use more, it overflows and gets grounds in the coffee. Bunn sent me a flow restricter brew head, but it did not help. The brew head is cheap plactic and after changing out a several times it bacame stripped and would not stay on. Another drawback it that you need to leave the coffe pot on all the time for the water to be fast and hot in the water resorvoir. So in the morning if you want to make coffee, you have to turn it on about 15 minutes ahead of the time you want to make it or leave it on all night. I am still looking for the perfect coffee maker."
5,Great Bunns!,I have had Bunn's for about 20 years now and love them. This one seems to be better designed than the previous ones I had. Makes great coffee and have had no issues whatsoever.
5,Excellent Coffee maker!,"I bought this coffee maker mostly because it brews coffee at near 200 degrees, but it took some time to figure out. Read the instructions. I had to ""prime"" the pump. I put plenty of water into this before I started brewing. Then I put in the amount of water I desired and kept the lid open until it heated internally up to 200 (about 15 minutes). It might just be me but I didn't really understand this from the instruction. I was almost ready to send it back to Amazon when I figured it out. But now, the coffee is superb!!! I loaded in some Costco Columbian grind and now can't wait to try like Starbuck's freshly ground beans. Considering it's cost as opposed to how much I love coffee and the reputation of Bunn, it is a wonderful purchase. This coffee is just as good as the best coffee houses I've been to. It's a simple machine but will look good in your kitchen and considering the coffee, you'lll look forward to seeing it every morning."
4,Love the taste of the coffee,"We got the white color in this coffeemaker. We live in Colorado so, because of our high altitude (7300ft) we had to send away for another coffeemaker specifically for HIGH ALTITUDE through the company BUNN. Once we did that we were very pleased with the coffee. The coffee stays hot and doesnt get that ""burned"" taste no matter how long its on the hot plate. My only complaint, why I gave it 4 stars, is that it doesnt have a auto matic shut off. I have to continually remember to turn off the unit."
4,Eloquent Silence,"I know this is one of her earlier books, so keeping that in mind, this is a good story. It is a good old fashioned romance. I really like the introduction of the hearing impaired character. It isn't something common, and added to my interest to learn something.Lauri Parrish is a teacher for hearing impaired students at a private school in which Drake's daughter Jennifer attends. Drake Rivington is an actor on a very popular daytime drama. When he finds out his daughter needs a home environment to grow, he immediately finds a way to lure Lauri to work for him, and help Jennifer. As Drake divides his time between his acting career and his family, we see his constant struggle to give his best to both worlds.I learned alot about the hearing impaired community, and appreciated this story. It was heartwarming."
2,"Dated ""Rebecca"" knock-off","Lauri leave the Big Apple to take a job as a private tutor for the deaf child of widowed soap star Drake Rivington at his home in Santa Fe. Sparks fly when he returns home from shooting and finds that in addition to being her tutor, Jennifer thinks of Lauri as a surrogate mom figure. Lauri falls for Drake but lives in the shadow of Susan, his perfect ballerina wife. Their loneliness, love for Jennifer and mutual passion bring them closer together, but Lauri still feels like a pale version of ethereal Susan.Brown's dated and misogynistic ""Rebecca"" knock-off pales in comparison to the original, but heats up the pages with steamy passages sure to curl your toes. And little Jennifer will steal even the most jaded reader's heart. But like so many early Brown novels, the romance is rushed and the dialogue pretty clunky, making this a less-than-stellar read."
2,"Can you say ""sexual harrassment""?","Deaf-student teacher is hired by attractive soap-opera actor to become his daughter's private, live-in tutor. She has hard time resisting sexual offers of this non-committing hero who promised not to love again after his wife died.Read this book the 1st time 15 yrs ago & liked it. Just re-read it & could not believe the glaring sexual harrassment behaviors at work here. Even though heroine tells hero clearly that his advances are unwelcomed b/c he hired her as her daughter's private tutor, hero responds by patting her butt & continues to come on to her. Heroine displays a typical 1980's heroine behavior of I-love-you-&-I-hate-you. It's amazing how our cultural perceptions of sexiness & sex at work places can change over the years.Read with caution."
3,Ok but not great!,"I must say I was used to more from this author! The story is not bad but it lacks that kind of something we have gotten used to from her.I liked the way in which their mutual atraction seems to grow and the way in which they fight it (or not, for that matter) but the whole married-but-not-quite-married thing made me roll my eyes. And the reason for which it was done.... LAME!!! 'not to disapoint her father' PLEASE!In the end, it was enjoyable for a day !"
1,Oh Brother,"I got this book on tape (and I can stomach almost anything to make my commute easier) but I could not finish this. Our hero's behavior screams of sexual harassment and hers is totally unrealistic. She is hired to tutor his child but wants him to move to a hotel when he get some time off so that she does not have to share HIS house with HIM. Doesn't she know she's an employee??? Why he would have hired this unstable young women to care for his child in the first place is a mystery. Maybe times were different when this was written, but I find it hard to believe that relationships have changed that much...I may listen to the last half of the last tape just to know how this mess ends. Don't brother with this one."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"Was this supposed to be a romance? Could have fooled me. Charaters without depth, a lame plot, a total waste of time and money. Very disappointed in this one!"
1,Does not work using windows vista or 7,I read the reviews here so I ordered a copy. I couldn't run this on either window vista or windows 7. Too bad it looked interesting.
2,Solving Tough Problems,The book confirmed some concepts from other readings I have completed but overall it was a disappointment. The concepts were not completed in a manner which I found helpful and the key concepts were to my view lost in meaningless verbage.I have recommended the book to others though as a starting point to grasp the concepts of dialogue and using scenario planning.
1,Not sure what I was expecting,"I was expecting much more from this book,at times it seemed to be the author's bio instead of giving/sharing the best practices of how to go through an approach in solving difficult issues."
5,Building bridges,"In a world beset by problems, this book offers real hope. Adam Kahane shares the techniques he has used in many of the world's trouble spots to bridge differences, establish a genuine conversation among adversaries, and create a positive future. This is not an academic book. It's based on real experience. Wherever we are called to end conflict, heal differences, and build collaboration we can learn from its lessons."
4,"Omega-Hungary, the electronic rock wizards","This CD contains some of the best known cuts of this best rock-and-roll band of their times, that spans from early 60s to 80s. Te music is mostly rock with electronic wizardy, unmistakenly European in its presentation and musicality. Despite the heavy rhythms, sharp and attacking electronic sounds, one can easily follow the melodies that are easy enough to stick in the mind and be hummed very soon. If you like the German Kraftwrk in German, then you will like this band in Hungarian."
4,Good tights for ballet class.,My daughter's ballet teacher wanted tights in this color (ballet pink) so I bought them. My daughter likes to wear them and sometimes wears them around the house. They seem to wear well.
5,They hold up well,"These tights have been through several ballet practices and they still look great! There are no holes, no runs, and my daughter says that they are very comfortable."
3,Thick waist band too uncomfortable for little one,"My very petite 7 year old found these too uncomfortable around the waist which lead to battles before every dance class. I wish we had gone with the Lands End version earlier. Those are not as durable as the Capezio, but are more comfortable."
2,This book is only for the dedicated.,"Frank M. D'Alessandro's book is not for the first-time Sacco and Vanzetti reader. ""The Verdict of History on Sacco and Vanzetti"" is the fourth book I've read on the subject, and I still found it difficult to follow. The writing and organization are both poor. There are few references given in the test, and there is no bibliography. Dr. D'Alessandro is a very strong supporter of the innocence of the two Italian anarchists and makes no attempt at a balanced presentation. He does, however, make some strong points which had not occurred to me before. I would like to see the same material presented in a more formal, rigorous way with refutations on the points made by recent ""guilty"" authors like Francis Russell."
2,Postscript to the review from Minneapolis,"I would like to correct an error in my earlier review of ""The Verdict of History Sacco and Vanzetti."" In my eagerness to get out some information about this book, I unforgivably submitted the review when I was only 80% through the book. Dr. D'Alessandro does include a chapter which refutes points made by ""guilty"" authors like Montgomery and Russell. In fact, this is probably the most effective section of the book although it does, in my opinion, suffer somewhat from illogic and lack of focus. Also, the backward references are hard to follow because the book has no index. However, I apologize for my mistake."
3,A highly detailed but unpolished account of a famous case.,"Dr. D'Alessandro presents details of the Sacco Vanzetti case that reinforced my own opinions of this travesty of American justice. That is not surprising in view of the fact that I, along with the good doctor, grew up in Providence in the same neighborhood as Joseph Morelli. Everyone, it seems, with the exception of the law knew, that the Morelli gang had stolen the payroll, killing two people. They bragged about it. Everyone knew that the metal boxes which had contained the payroll were thrown into the deepest end of Canada Pond. So I am not at all surprised that this author believes that the two anarchists were innocent and were railroaded by the establishment. The book is occasionally laborious but does maintain the reader's interest. It is clearly the work of someone on a mission and it reads more like a textbook than a polished novel. Even so I found it to be good reading by an enthusiastic writer."
4,"Thoughful, clear, and enjoyable.","While I did not agree with all of Hunter's arguments, I highly reccommend this book. Hunter provides a thoughtful examination of the history of moral education and how contemporary character education, although well-intentioned, does little to improve the morality of youth. Character, as defined by Aristotle, requires not only knowing the good but being able to reason about it. This wisdom, or what Aristotle called phronesis, is something that is overlooked in our modern climate of fast, easy, and scientifically ""proven"" methods. Hunter makes a profound argument as to how both character education and psychological approaches perpetuate, rather than ameliorate the problem of thin and narrow moral understandings. However, disagree with Hunter's sentiment that the problem is unsolvable (as is clearly suggested by his title). ...but that is another issue altogether. Don't get me started!"
4,"Great book, but...","I Like the book, but the author tends to use ten words when 5 would do and goes out of his way to use ten dollar words when 5 dollar words would make for a smoother and more fluent read. I have a college degree and am quite well educated in a general way and the topic of the book is not alien to me. I really get it.For the content I would give Mr Hunter five stars but for his writing two stars at best. My four star rating therefore is rather generous.Amazon, as nearly always, performed flawlessly."
2,Glad it's over,"Most of Hunter's writing, with it's cumbersome, lengthy sentences full of sociological jargon, is hard to read, and the tiny type (10 point?) doesn't help. The section on the history of the techniques used for the moral education of our children, from the 18th century forward, is more straightforward. In the U.S., we started with commonly-held morals based on biblical commands and progressed to each of us making up his own individual set of values. The author is pessimistic about things getting any better. Don't look for solutions to the problems he enumerates. Rather, he sees us sliding down a slippery slope of disintegrating morals into eventual chaos. Honestly, if I'd known what the book would be like, I wouldn't have bought it. Having bought it, if someone had told me what it would be like, I wouldn't have read it. On the other hand, it was fascinating to see, from the history he details, just how we got from there to here."
5,Great for Small Needs,I love my Weller iron and I needed a smaller tip. This is doing just fine. Glad you can still find quality products out there these days.
3,Garbage...works for awhile,"It works great for about 10 joints...then it all goes downhill. The tip will stop getting hot in certain points, making solder stick to it permanently. You then have to find a ""hot spot"" and use that one spot if you want to solder. This is the second one I bought, both doing the same thing. Maybe I'm not taking care of it correctly, but I tin it before every use, and I store it correctly. The tip turns blue after awhile (maybe i have too much heat)...not recommended for non-expert use."
5,There are more good ones to come!!,Hot Version Vol 1 is an excellent car video especially if you're a fan of Drift King and Orido-san. A great great video. [...] There are 4 out to this date and there will be more being released every other month. See for yourself on www.bestmotoringvideo.com.
4,Good support,"I bought one of these after a condition I thought was improving proved otherwise. Several months ago, I bent my thumb back behind my hand during a fall, and the joint has been tender ever since. This brace is leaps and bounds ahead of other kinds due to the two metal strips that run along the thumb, rather than a thick pile of neoprene wrapped around the joints like many other brands use. The adjustable Velcro and ambidextrous orientation are also very nice, since this will work with most hand sizes and shapes. 4 stars instead of 5 due to the Velcro that goes around the wrist, which starts to lose its switching after a while, and the neoprene stitching that starts to become frazzled after prolonged use near the ends of the brace. Very good overall, though."
5,awesome!!!,"If you are a serious voleyball player, you know what is to have your thumb injured!!! this stabilizer will you give you protection and security, and it will not irritate or bother you during the game!!!the sizing is ok and comes in package of two, which is a good option.Forget about the everyday tape,,i will buy 2 more for my daughter, and here, everybody asks where did I find it!!!"
4,lpl,"Tried ACE thumb stabilizer--the binding was stiff and abrasive. Returned it to Walgreens. Bought Futuro thumb stabilizer--smooth, soft, great fit. Just what the doctor ordered, so to speak. It even fits inside my Futuro wrist stabilizer for complete support during the night. Why Walgreens stopped carrying Futuro is beyond understanding--it is far superior to ACE brand. The price of both products is similar. Why only four stars? The small Velcro strap that wraps around the tip of the thumb easily slides up, off the stabilizer--not really needed on my hand, may be an issue with a smaller hand. Also, the sizing runs a little small--I ware a cadet large golf glove, and the stabilizer is a snug fit, like a well-made golf glove."
1,Shoddy Workmanship,This is the second order and once again the stitching is coming out where the stays are located!
4,It meets my needs.,"This is what I have been looking for. I had purchased one from a store years ago, but haven't seen the same thing since. I was thrilled to find it for about the same price I paid for the one years ago."
4,Consider more than wrist,"I have used several types of gloves for my arthritis and thought this would be good. I use a medium quilters glove, because of wrist size, and bought the same size in this. What I never thought of was the size of my thumb. These stabilizers have a really tight thumb opening and I had to cut the sewing and make them wider to fit - otherwise, my thumb went numb. There is more to these than just wrist measurements when determining size."
3,OK IF YOU HAVE A MEDIUM HAND,"THIS IS A FAIRLY GOOD PRODUCT BUT LOSES ITS SHAPE EASILY AND THE SIZING IS TOO GENERAL. THE SMALL/MEDIUM IS MEDIUM. IT'S TOO LARGE FOR A SMALL HAND AND SINCE IT DOESN'T HOLD IT'S SHAPE WELL, IT'S SOON WAY TOO LARGE."
2,returning immediately,"I couldnt wait to get this item; ive been in so much pain with my thumb. Well this brace is so tight on the thumb that my thumb goes completely numb. It does help stabilize the thumb however, which is the purpose of the brace, but it made it so numb I had to take it off and Im returning it."
3,Futuro wrist supports review,The provider that sold me this product was very good.The product itself was somewhat disappointing as the sowing was fairly poor where the thumbs protrude. The threads were sticking out and unraveling. Otherwise the supports worked well.
5,Really Helped,"As I have gotten older my thumbs have gotten weaker. After clearing out my mother's house my thumbs were killing me. It hurt to hold a toothbrush. I got two of these and wore them all day. It helped protect my thumbs from over extending and finally they got better and I quit wearing them. I do put them on when I know I am going to be doing a lot of hand work and I don't want my thumbs injured.You can bend the little metal spine that is in it to get it to fit comfortably, I did that then took an ink pen and marked and L on the left one so I knew which one fit comfortably on which hand."
5,Great help to avoid pain,This thumb stabiizer is great using it to avoid continuous pain. It is even a better help to continue my housework.VERY GOOD PRODUCT..
4,"Pretty good, but doesn't stabilize the wrist","I ordered this product because I was having terrible pain at the base of my thumbs and I couldn't get into my doctor right away. They definitely helped keep my thumbs stabilized, but the pain continued. When I saw my doctor I found out I have a form of tendonitis, so I needed my wrist stable too while it healed. I got a new brace from her, and it worked wonders. I do sometimes wear this thumb stabilizer at night while I am sleeping if I am having trouble. It's a lot smaller than my other brace and easy to sleep while wearing it. If you have a condition that doesn't need your wrist stable to heal, then this should do it! My only complaint is that it made my tip of my thumb fall asleep at first, and if I wore it for extended periods, the support would dig into my skin and make it raw and painful."
3,Thumb Stabilizer Too Tight,"Quality product, comfortable fabric, easy to put on, but I think the thumb portion of the brace is too small. I'm a petite person with average sized hands and fingers, and the thumb portion is so tight that it cuts off my thumb circulation so that my thumb actually turns blue and gets cold. I bought two of the braces because I do a lot of YOGA,and have developed thumb tendonitis. These don't work for the reason I purchased them, but I'm too lazy to go through the hassle of returning them."
4,Great Price,"It took longer to receive this product then it has other items I have purchased on Amazon. The boxes were really banged up, but the actual product was not damaged. Price was a great deal, less then it would have cost me in the store, including the shipping."
2,give the reality stars a camera?,"Throw some money at reality TV stars and see what you get. The result? A low budget attempt at horror. This is something you might find on Cinemax at 1am. The plot is weak, the acting is horrible, and the shooting isn't incredibly strong.You must be a strong believer in reality TV to enjoy this movie."
3,what you expect,the movie is about what you'd expect. it is campy but entertaining. I would recommend it for those who enjoy campy horror films.
4,I really loved this movie,"I really loved this movie. I like to watch a few reality shows, and I was pleasently surprised at how well they acted! But, some on the other hand, I was embarassed for them bc they were just aweful. I wish they had the dvd series of Kill Reality. Those episodes leading up to the movie make it easier to understand. (plus, it was entertaining!) Let me know if the series box set will ever come out. I'd totally get it!"
2,Reality TV....NOT HORROR,"I just recently purchased and watched this movie and I must say this... You REALLY have to be a fan of reality tv to endure this terrible flop. It seems that a bad script, bad acting(Except for Ethan from Survior who only gets like 10 lines), and bad production leads to a BAD MOVIE. Not much of a suprise. This movie was absolutly awful. It gets two stars for the fact that Tanya and Trishelle get topless(as does every other female star). If you REALLY REALLY like the stars of reality tv, go for it. Otherwise, its just a waste of money."
2,Not really THAT bad...,"I didn't think that The Scorned was really all that bad. The story line kept moving and never got bogged down. While the acting wasn't worthy of Shakespeare, I've definitely seen worse.You get to see a LOT of good flesh, which makes up for some of the show's shortfalls.But the thing that really makes this DVD worth it is the behind the scenes extras. Think you've seen a Hollywood hissy-fit? Watch this one."
5,Great functional boot bag!,"This bag easily fits ski boots up to mens size 13 as well as a helmet, goggles and hat / gloves. Easy to use, easy to carry!"
4,Boot Bag,"this bag is designed perfectly, ski boots, helmets gloves and everything else. i used it for a trip with my daughters and had 3 helmets gloves hats etc.. in it with no problem. my only critique is that there is no padding in the back of the bag so it can be tough on your back if you you don't pack it right."
4,Boot Gear Bag Review,"I like the boot bag. Plenty of room for helmet, boots and gear. The boot compartments could be a little larger, but they work."
4,Great bag!,"I've only used this for one ski season, but it easily fits my boots, helmet, snowpants, hats/mittens, etc. Plenty of space in one handy bag."
2,"Film Review ""Machined""","Whatever I was expecting in this movie I just didn't get. I have tried, unsuccessfully, 3 times to watch it. The film just can NOT keep my interest, and it left me ""flat."" Having NOT seen it all the way through, I might be ""fair"" in this review, but...... ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ......."
2,Go for a modern recording,"Not only is this an excerpt (as the previous author noted), but most annoyingly, it's not remastered from the original. The performance (Boulez, NY Phil) is great, but this is a classical release from the 'early days' of CDs, and the AAD can be clearly heard. I love CDs of older recordings, but they should get at least some remastering."
2,Nothing like the first few classic seasons. Will tarnish your memory of TMNT.,"Looking at the other reviews, just because its TMNT does not mean its perfect. CBS Kids ruined the series by changing the way everyone acted and fought. They even took away Michelangelo's nun-chucks and made him use a TMNT communicator tied to a rope. Michelangelo would lasso people and slam them into the wall over and over until they were knocked out. I fail to see how this is any more kid safe.Final Episode: Did not live up to the shows standards. It was in no way epic, or really closed the 10 season series in any way. Just another run of the mill episode that could of never been made.If your watching this season thinking I want to remember my childhood show and see how they finished this series, this is not it. It will tarnish your memory of the classic show."
5,Great learning book.,"This is a very good book for begginers, but you still have to sit down and practice the basics with it... it's very good."
5,Essential for learning Japanese,Verbs are a major part of any language. This books shows conjugations and grammar points related to verbs. It's truly one of my favorite books for learning. I refer to it often when I want to say something. It's laid out well and easy to follow.
4,George Foreman Grill,Good for the person who is health conscious and wants to grill meats instead of frying!
2,Buy a diffrent one!,"I bought this item a few months ago and it cooks fast and well, but the trouble you go through to clean it is not worth the time to cook anything on it. First off, it does not have an on/off switch so you have to unplug it risking shock if you don't wait for the light to turn off. Second, it's burner plates don't come off so cleaning is a monumental task. Third, the grease always manages to run off onto the table or wherever you're cooking on. It takes longer to clean than to cook!"
3,Smaller than stated - BIG DISSAPOINTMENT!,"Sure, we (thought we got a deal). The next day, it went on sale for $10.00 less. Bummer. We got it fast and took it out of the boxes, and to our surprise, this Foreman Grill was much SMALLER THAN INDICATED on the description! by over an inch on each side. Another Bummer! The description is extremely misleading, considering that we measured several times before ordering. It's smaller than we wanted, but will work for now I suppose?."
3,short lived George Foreman Grills,"I've had about 5 foreman grills so far. I probably used it at the most 3 to four times a week. After about 9 mo. of use the teflon coating starts peeling off the grill. Can't think that's healthy, so I throw it out and buy a new one. It's happened to every one I've purchased. The grill, grills fine, I just wish I could find one that holds up better. To expensive to keep replacing."
2,Choose another model!,"This model burns everything so it is not edible, while leaving the center still raw. I am not talking thick meats, I cook thin hamburgers, and fish. I had another model that worked great. Lost it in a move so I got this one. Bad choice!"
4,Smaller than I expected,"I'm not good at measuring things, but 80sq ins sounded big to me and this turned out smaller than I expected. Thankfully, the recipeint(my mother) was happy with it. We've only used it once so far, but it cooked our food quickly and everything got done all the way through. All in all, a good little grill."
4,Great Grill!,"I use this grill often enough that it remains on the kitchen counter. It cooks fast. A thin-cut ribeye is ready in about 4 minutes. A salmon filet goes on the grill frozen solid, and is cooked and ready to eat in 10 to 12 minutes. Makes great hamburgers, and there's no greasy spatter on the counter after cooking. Cleaning can be a chore, which is the only reason I didn't give this grill a full 5-star rating."
4,Wish it was a little bit bigger,Great product cuts down on cooking time. Really like the extended handle. Only downside is that I wish I would have bought a little bit bigger grill. Other than that so far no complaints.
4,Just Great!!,One of the best series ever made for t.v. I could not waitfor the fifth season to come out. Finally. All the actorsare so geat especially Mary- Louise Parker who is (likeMarisa Tomei or Elizabeth Perkins) one of the better actressesof her generation.
3,Not their best season,"We have watched all of the shows in order, and are now in the middle of the fifth season. I have to say that the tone and writing style are definitely different. It's like things are going on all around you, and you're standing in the middle of it trying to make sense of everything. The dialogue is often akward and disjointed, and more often than not I've found myself wondering, ""what did they mean by that?""It's still a great show, and I still enjoy it...it's just really hard to get used to this season if you've watched and gotten used to the first four seasons."
3,WW5,"The show is wonderful as always. However, starting with the fifth season, the closed captioning was only in foreign language. Can you only be hard of hearing in spanish or french? Gimme a break! They could have done better. I'm very disappointed."
3,"It gets better after disc 2, but it lacks the spark of the other seasons","What can I say I love west wing, but I wont be bullied by those who say this season is quality. The first 2 discs much like the bartlett administration searching for a message searching for direction, you feel the same way about John&#12288;Wells, searching for a story. The dialogue just feels flat, and Leo has become a real pain in the ass, he is rude and acts very un-leo like. For the completist you gotta have it, and Season 6 is excellent, but you just feel that the starting line up missed the game on this one."
3,Slow 5th season,the whole 5th season and on seems like a slow news day to me. Since the loss of Sorkin the whole show has taken a steep nose dive. Don't get me wrong i still love the show but it's just lacking that little extra umph that Sorkin brought.
5,"Down, but not out","Even though the 5th season was weakened by the loss of Aaron Sorkin, the cast alone overcame the scripts. Besides, you don't give up on your family just because they have a bad year, do you? And as we all know now, there is a strong finish ahead in seasons 6 and 7, so it's worth it not to miss anything in between."
5,Loving this show.,"Sometimes watch 7 shows in a night. Quick witted, brilliantly written, fun, intuitive, complex and still relevant to today! Love it!"
5,West Wing Rocks,One of the best t.v. shows ever!A great product at a reasonable price 22hours of entertainment for the same price as a 2 hour movie
4,Started out slow - ended great!,"While I agree that this season lacked something with Sorkin missing, I do think people were very nervous and expected too much from John Wells. It took a few episodes, but the show got back it's rhythm that Wells wanted. It wasn't supposed to mimic Sorkin or anyone else. John Wells needed to find his own strength and he did.For an example of his kind of quality, you have to look no further than Days of Our Lives!"
1,Like a bad sequal,"After four of the best seasons for any series in television history, Season 5 of the West Wing was just aweful. Of course, this marks the first season without Aaron Sorkin. The show did not survive the loss.This was like watching the third Godfather movie."
3,More CJ equals less entertainment,"I loved this show in seasons 1-4, with the exception of the character of CJ. The show seemed to go out of it's way to make her look overly smart, sexy, youthful, etc.... example: in season 4, she appears at a ""Rock the Vote"" rally in hip hugger jeans and a tight t-shirt. Do press secretaries really do that? There are constant references to how sexy she is.....how smart.....these references seem to be pugged into the show at random times. Season 5 pus her on the screen WAY too much. She is the weakest actor in the group. They needed more Ainsley, less CJ! After this season, the storylines deteriorate. There is no longer the depth in the writing that was apparent in seasons 1-4.HOWEVER.....a true West Wing fan will enjoy most of this season. I can't say it is the best, but it is still better than 99% of everything else that is on tv."
5,Great!,All of my dvd's came earlier than expected and were in perfect condition! Would definitely purchase from amazon again.
3,So Sorry It's Been Canceled,"The recently announced cancellation of this series is grievous, if inevitable.As political fantasy, nothing else has ever come close. And the acting, if not the writing, for the fifth season is just as good as ever.We really love this series, and are really sorry to see it go. It's the best argument against term limits that I can imagine..."
5,Love it,Have the whole series!!!! My husband and I have watched all the seasons in one month. We had watched it when it first aired and it was just as great the second time around.
4,Maybe the last great season before West Wing jumped the shark,"I love this show. This is a great season. But if you watched the original, you know that this is one of the last great seasons before things get weird. Savor every moment."
5,Learning politics,It allowed me to understand the working of politics and the personal relationship of the people which make decisions for us
5,More of the best,"You cant help being addicted to watching this series. After Series 4 was so engaging its great to see that series 5 doesnt disappoint.Some of the best drama writing-fast, politically savvy and witty, with great delivery from a stellar cast. Keep them coming."
4,I LOVE SQUEE!!! but...,".... not Wobbly Head Bob. I can't say enough good things about squee, meanwhile, true tales of human drama and, for some reason that completely escapes me, I even adore happy noodle boy. Wobbly Head Bob on the other hand litterally gave me migranes. Painfully depressing. PAINFULLY. Like a hundred million termites sing showtunes in you brian painfully.Otherwise, it's a wonderful book and most definately worth that week and a half I didn't eat lunch to save up my money and buy it. But do yourself a favor and skip the section with Wobbly Head Bob. You'll thank me later."
5,yeah.,"All I have to say is one little useless word, and people in the know will flock to this book like zombies to the brain buffet. And that word is ...meanwhiles.Buy me or I'll die."
4,Not as good as Johnny...,"But it's still really good. Rather than following Johnny and his adventures, this book centers on Squee. From being abducted by aliens to fighting giant bugs, Squee really doesn't get a chance to rest. If JTHM was too dark for you, Squee would definitely be a good choice. You get Squee, and then after that, you get the infamous 'Meanwhiles' and 'Wobbly-Headed Bob' series. This comic is recommended to anyone with a dark sense of humor or any fan of Vasquez's other works. Pure genius."
5,Boo!,"I personally think that, though Squee is /not/ better the JTHM, it does live up to the renouned author's name. Just good, dark, gothy fun! Squee is too adorable and creepy to give up, this is a must-read! ... Anyway, this is Awesome! For fans of Invador Zim (zim was in the background of a few pictures even) And Nny ... Buy this book!"
5,ALL HAIL PEPITO!!!,"fun as hell even though you've probabally already read it all in the ""regular"" comics."
5,Jhonen = God ^_^,"I have every single book that Jhonen has ever published, and I love the JtHM director's cut and Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horror's the most. Squee is such a cute lil' mongoose."
5,gift item,"bought for my 16 yr old son,lives with me,and he's a big of these types of dark humor comics,so he love it.thanks"
4,note: I did skip over parts.,"This book had much less of a plot line than JTHM- okay so there wasn't really a plot line. But it was fun anywho. Happy Noodle Boy became annoying to me, as did Wobbly Headed Bob. Some of the instances are just plain disturbing -chickenscrewing anyone?- but funny in a completely gross way."
2,Not ALL that...,"Maybe I lost the Joke or maybe I was expecting another Invader Zim, I don't know, but this isn't as great as everybody make it sound like.I wasn't able to laugh even once (and I love sadistic jokes about life and destine).I must say that Satan and his son are the best thing in the book (this and the meanwhiles) but Squee it self is not that funny."
3,good LDS teens and parents beware,"If you've seen invader zim, you'll love it. I gave this book such a low rating for one thing: language! There is an average of a curse word a page. Not just the usual slang, but things like the ""f"" word and other ""hardcore"" cuss words. It would be so much funnier w/o those words."
5,JUST HILARIOUS!,"This is a great book by Jhonen...I've always been a fan, and this one was a good addition. Some of the stories are so funny that I actually teared up laughing with my husband reading them and noticing the characters overly animated faces! Gotta have a broad sense of humor and i suggest you check out the innards to see if you have a taste for the humor. Very funny/offensive. HAAA"
1,This book has everything except what I need,"Don't buy this book if you want to learn the technique of snowboarding. It mostly has info for those who would like to know everything about snowboarding except how to do it. Out of 150 pages, only 1 is devoted to instruction: ""keep your knees bent, look where you are going, and listen to your instructor"". Well, how do you ride the darn thing? Otherwise it has lots of history and cool pictures of people doing tricks."
4,Thick Book with lots of info!,"Book is a collection of articles on a variety of death and dying topics. Very thorough and helpful, but some articles are inevitably more helpful than others. Overall very good though!"
5,Love it!!,"This cereal is absolutely one of my favourites, love the flavour and the nuts and cannot believe that is gluten free, a real treat for people who want a nice cereal or something to add to a yogurt."
5,ANOTHER GREAT TASTING GRANOLA FROM BAKERY ON MAIN!!,"Along with several other Bakery on Main products, this one ranks high in my books - I look for great tasting products since I'm limited often times with what I can have, and I've been very impressed with Bakery on Main's quality products. I think if you try these products you'll be pleased, too!"
4,Great snack for adults and kids!,"We are gluten free and dairy free at our house and great products are hard to find! Bakery on Main does GF/DF right! This gronola is tasty. I have tried many kinds and have no complaints with this one. It works well as a snack on the go, in lunch boxes, or as a bowl of cereal inthe morning!"
4,GF granola search,I like this granola. I like the texture of the different ingredients. It is really good in yogurt.
5,Delicous and Fresh,We had been getting this granola at the health food store and found it online at Amazon. It is much cheaper and more fresh than the health food store and delivered to my front door. My entire family loves this stuff. This flavor is my personal favorite.
2,This is a children's cereal.,"I am sorry I tried this product. I do not know why the other reviewers have rated this cereal so highly. This is a children's cereal. This a mediocre product that has nothing in common with a homemade style granola. I've been using ""Oat Cuisine"" gourmet granola ([...]) for years. It is the closest to a homemade granola that I've found."
1,Tastes bad,"Simply put, this just doesn't taste good. I'm surprised it got ratings this high, because it really doesn't deserve them.Edit: I should have figured; it's gluten free. So the people reviewing this are probably used to eating bad-tasting things."
1,Overpriced...Try Trader Joes Brand,"My wife has been on a GF diet for a few years now, and recently our son was diagnosed as well. She found and ordered this product to try out and we all loved the taste right away. I was a little dismayed at the price per bag, but I soon found out that pretty much all GF specialty foods were on the pricey side and I needed to get used to it, especially b/c she had to order most of it online (add S&H;).But then they opened up a Trader Joe's right down the street from us this past year and we discovered a near-identical cereal product for half the price!!! Same flavor, same ingredients, same GF assurance...but only $2.99 a bag.They even started carrying this product in our local Kroger grocery stores recently, but it's still $6.99 per bag!!! So no S&H;, but you're still paying crazy $$$ for cereal.No contest for us...TJ all the way."
5,Natural Goodness,"This cereal is sooo good. It isn't overly sweet, but has natural sweetness to it. The chunks of dried fruit and nuts are delicious. I originally bought this for my son who is on a gluten free diet and tried it myself and prefer it to other cereals. The grains are whole and in tact."
3,"Tasty, but VERY sweet","I enjoy the flavors in this cereal a great deal. I like the crunchiness and the fruit flavors and the maple flavor as well. Unfortunately I find it to be way too sweet. Four of the ingredients are sweeteners including evaporated cane juice, raisin juice, honey, and cranberry sugar. At least there is no high fructose corn syrup, but there are a total of 13 grams of sugar in each 3/4 cup serving. A bit much for my taste.I don't think I will buy it again, but to help me get through the six bags I purchased, I mix it with an equal share of plain, unsweetened rice cereal."
5,non gluten cereal,"It is a very good product...all flavors...and my husband loves it. So I buy a different flavor (in bulk) every time I order, as it is so much cheaper than in our grocery stores."
5,Great tasting product,"Kind of expensive, but very tasty. Necessary addition to the bland gluten free cereals out there so that I can have a quick and nutricious breakfast everyday. Tried the other bakery on main but only this one I like. Rest usually have strong cinamon taste which gets tiring after a few weeks."
5,Bakery on Main Granola,"Recently diagnosed as gluten-intolerant, I have been looking for products that allow me to resume a semblance of my former life. This granola meets my needs for morning breakfast cereal. It has the mouth-feel of a traditional crunchy breakfast; without the wheat. The cranberries add a pleasant tart-sweet fruit flavor surprise in the bottom of your bowl. All the BoM cereals are good, but this one is my favorite."
5,great taste,Very tasty product..good for you and tastes good..great combo.I love it over the top of vanilla yogurt..yummmy
3,Lots of build up ... but a little disappointing,"Somehow, I expected there to be more humour in this book and was a little disappointed by the lack of it. Also, the anticipation that builds during the book didn't quite live up to its promise as I thought the end was a little disappointing. I was also confused as to why such a wise witch would allow herself to get so upset and flustered.I'm not quite sure if Magical Love is quite my thing but if you like Magic then give this a try,in the end it really is a nice love story."
3,Pleasant Read,"I enjoyed reading about Sarina and Dagon. However, This book was more like a contemporary romance with just a bit of finger waving and floating thrown in. It was a fine entertaining read with good characterization and I recommend it, just don't get your hopes up in seeing any great magical feats wowing you. The premise of A secret witch society has great possibilities that I hope Donna Fletcher will expand on in any future books she may do in this series."
1,It's an unreliable piece of junk,"I bought one of these units probably 10 years ago, it was very good and worked well, and when it died I thought I'd get another same make and model. I'm not sure what has gone wrong in the manufacturing process now but these emergency lights are terrible. I purchased one from Amazon and it had to be returned because the battery was leaking, so I returned it for another, and it was promptly replaced by Amazon. I was just a victim of hurricane Sandy and when the power failed and the lights went out the Lithonia ELM 2 didn't even come on, and yes it was plugged in. I was going to return it to Amazon but it was beyond the 30 day period so I just threw it in the garbage can, which is where it belongs. Stay away from this product, It's an unreliable and horrible product and I'd never buy another Lithonia product ever again."
3,A Little Disappointed...,"Not quite as simple an installation as described. Must be hardwired into a 4"" square or octagon junction box. We bought two as gifts and one for ourselves. We will be installing our own, but will replace the gifts with something else that does not require reconfiguration of our friends homes or an electrician for those who don't do electricity. The style is very nice and will serve us well in the Pacific Northwest with all our power outages."
3,Also consider the LED version,"This light carries the larger size rechargeable batteries designed specifically for these types of exit lights (same kind as used in house alarm systems). The more expensive, but less power hungry LED version of this light, carries a much smaller rechargeable battery, so that housing can be a little smaller. Be sure to consider run time of this unit alongside of the LED version, and decide which best suits your need. For me, I was OK with the more affordable, slightly larger model, with reduced run time. For commercial use, one may want to step-up to the LED."
3,Lithonia,These lights are cheap simple to replace but like I said cheap. We bought these to replace the ones that have went out so that is what we replaced it with. Had to send back due to lights not working out of the box and they took care of that with no problem.
5,top of the line emergency light,great product easy to install super fast shipping came in handy had a power outage just a few day after i had installed this new light.
4,school bus for my 5-year-old,"I'm so happy I got this for my son. He's been wanting another school bus with a functioning stop sign, and this fits the bill. It's also bigger than I expected, and it's doors work too. I think he'll really love it!"
5,BREAKING SILENCE: THE CASE THAT CHANGED THE FACE OF HUMAN RI,"Exciting and action packed thriller that is historically accurate.This book highlights the case that was decided in the US Supreme Court this year (2004).This is an affirmation that tortures and other human rights violators, who strike anywhere in the World, may be held to account by their victims in US Courts. It is apparant that Dr. White has a first person knowledge of the people and places involved and he is supremely effective as an historian who lived this era in history!"
2,Uninteresting,"Ron Blake has released better albums. This one strains to have any melody or harmony. More of frowning, serious work. I like only one song on it. Not a good purchase."
1,The worst album I've ever heard,"This was by far, the worst album I've ever heard in my entire life. This even worse than Kenny G's Songbird. And that is saying a lot. Imagine you're favorite food. Cooked to perfection by your favorite cook. And then before its served to you, the cook spits in it. That bad.True the rhythm section vibes good together, but when Blake comes in he totally kills the vibe. So out of a 5, I give this album a 1. And thats because your can't go any lower than that."
2,Boring,"I bought this for my son's playroom thinking because he likes bouncing on his trampoline he would also like this. Well, I was wrong it doesn't really bounce the same at all and, after like ten minutes he was like okay now what. It's not worth the money if you want something for bouncing just get a regular trampoline with the safety net, it's a lot more fun!"

2,sun damage -- no resistance to sun and heat,"Seemed to work well enough, until the battery failed. Then, I found that the sensor is not UV-protected. After a year in use, the sun has damaged my sensor so badly that when I tried to change the battery, the plastic broke apart in my hands from being so brittle. Also, the rubber stopper on the bottom doesn't handle the heat well either, and leaves nasty black stuff on your hands that's difficult to remove after touching it.Adding a little UV protection into the plastic would go a long ways to make this last longer. 1 year in service is pretty poor."
1,Orbit Wireless Rain Freeze Sensor,I have been unable to get the the Obrit Sprinkler System Rain Freeze Sensor (# 57071) even after specific support from Orbit Technical Support. I spent a lot of time trying to get it to work without success. It's the biggest waste of money I've made in a long time
3,Still waiting for rain,I selected the Orbit Rain Sensor since I have an Orbit Controller. The unit was easy to install and passed the internal tests - sprinklers shut off when the override button was pressed and when the test button on the sensor was pressed. Still waiting for one of our infrequent Southern California rains for the final test. I will update this review after our next decent rain storm.
4,Wizardry and tech mesh,"The second book in the Darkwar trilogy sets up Marika's madness in book three. Personally, I found this book a little hard to get through at times, but all in all I enjoyed the story and found it was better when viewed through the lens of book three."
3,The Inside Story of WW II Fighter pilots,This gives an excellent inside look at the workings of the Army Air Corp in Europe in WW II.
2,Okay but not the greatest,"I have read several of the books about flying aces in WWII. Although the book fit the subject, it was not full of action that I would have expected from an ace."
3,Good account,"I enjoyed this book and feel that it probably deserves 3.5 stars. It is difficult for any American fighter pilot to compete with the accounts submitted by the Brits and the Germans. Generally, the relative intensity and duration of exposure to combat was less for the Americans. That said, this remains an interesting and valuable account of a fascinating period in aviation history."
4,An Ace of the Eight:An American Fighter Pilot's Air War in Europe,"A well written personal account of a WW2 fighter pilot flying two of America's finest fighters of the time, the P-47 Thunderbolt and the P-51 Mustang. As an instrument rated pilot myself, I was chilled by the high rate of fatalities causes by the primitive flight instruments and the sever weather conditions in England at that time. I was shocked to read the Eighth Airforce lost almost as many pilots to weather as to the enemy fighters. Excellent discription of air battles. This book will have a special place in my collection of WW2 flying stories. I recommend this book highly."
3,"Good book, really brought into focus the actual life of a pilot","Many of the WWII fighter ace books leave the reader with the impression that the pilots have dog fights daily. This book gives the reader a true understanding of the problems the weather created for the pilots. It has had a few technical facts new to me, for example, the fact that the drop tanks were made of paper/cardboard and later ones had an igniter so they could be used as fire bombs and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine's bad habit of fouling spark plugs. The differences in life style of the P47 pilots doing close air support versus the England based P51 pilots was also striking."
4,Midnight at the lost and found,Meat Loaf is a verry good singer and this is one of his best. It's great
3,Not the worst...so stop saying that,"Look, the 80's were a blur of alchol and cocaine...most of the music that evolved from it was a bit crap. that being said I love this album. This and Bad Attidude are his best albums from the 80's. Wolf at Your Door is a great song taken from Meat's own problems with money at the time and is every bit as good his other songs. Title song great and Razor's Edge is hard core rock. Honestly, i think his worst album was Couldn't Have Said it Better. Meat can make it without Steinmen no problem. When they work together it is true magic and Steinmen is a god of lyrics (i do adore him), but Meat can and has managed on his own. Check this album out. IMO it is far better than Dead Ringer, which got on my nerves."
4,A Non-bombastic Gem,"No, it's not Bat Out Of Hell...and that's a good thing. This album proves that Meat Loaf is more versatile than expected. He does good work even without his collaborator Jim Steinman. The only song I didn't care for (but it's growing on me) is Prisilla. I sing Wolf at Your Door every time I have to pay bills.If you are expecting the bombastic Bat sound you'll be disappointed, but this CD is solid and great for driving."
2,"The Loaf's worst. Stay away, far away.","It killed me to admit to myself that this was a bad album. It really did, but you just can't escape the facts. Meat Loaf's first two albums were fantastic, timeless classics (even though Dead Ringer sold about 30 million less copies than Bat out of Hell), both had something in common: Songs by Jim Steinman. Meat and Steinman split after DR and this is his first solo effort, and while the first two songs (Razor's Edge and the title track) are actually quite good, the rest of the album shows instantly why Meat never wrote his own songs back in the Bat days. His voice is in better form than Dead Ringer, much better, but the songs and the music just aren't up to snuff. Stay away from this album and go for his next effort, Bad Attitude... also known as his real comeback album."
2,Yeeesh . . .,"What would have happened if Meat Loaf hadn't teamed up with Jim Steinman, and instead got grabbed by purveyors of light-to-medium power pop? Midnight at the Lost and Found.There are two songs worth a listen here -- the rousing title track, and the Elvis cover ""The Promised Land."" The rest of it is Loaf back in good vocal form but singing bad, bad songs. It hurts the brain when people who aren't Jim Steinman try to write like him -- only Steinman's got the huevos to pull off his strange, grand visions.Skip this one and be glad you did, or be like me and get stuck with a copy no used CD place will every buy."
3,Too many corners cut..,"This system does not run well out of the box. You will need to upgrade the memory to 2gb and replace the atheros wifi module. The cheap wifi module causes the system to constantly pause (for up to 10 seconds!). It's a driver issue for sure but none the less, it's annoying. After these changes I still wasn't happy with the performance so I switched to xp tablet PC edition OS. Now my Q1u-v runs ok. I've come to not expect much in the performance department of these little PC but they should be able to at least play video files without annoying pauses. Bottom line, if your one who like to tool around with your devices to make them work properly, this is the device for you. If you someone who is not technically oriented, look elsewhere."
1,Just say no!,"We bought this to manage pictures and email while travelling.Pro: It's a full Windows Vista computer small enough to carry in a large coat pocket. OK battery life. Good gadget factor. It will pass airport security while in your bag.Con: Very slow. Too small to be substitute for a full sized computer. The ""keyboard"" is a joke. Without a hard cover the screen is in constant jeopardy of damage.Overall this was far more frustration than it was worth. Returned it to Amazon. Next time we will take a laptop."
4,A Pleasant find!,"This little, charming recipe book offers a variety of recipes that are delicious and flavourful. My absolute favourite is the Garbanzo Feta salad! Other good recipes are: Creamy Corn Bread, Layered rice and Rolled Apple Cakes. The book offers suggested meal plans that are fun and creative. My only complaint is that the recipes seem to contain a lot of fat and sugar! I still have more recipes to try out, but I do enjoy them."
3,Good but ...,"It has been 3 months since I purchased this product. Overall, I am happy with the purchase, but one problem came up recently. The on/off button does not work very well, something got broken/displaced inside and I had to press very hard to turn it on/off."
3,Wrong color,"We ordered this sleeping bag expecting to receive the color in the online picture. Instead, we received a navy green sleeping bag. Grady's Hardware customer service was helpful and will provide a discount, but told me ""the manufacturer changed the color... We have no control over the color."" Be forewarned when you make your choice!"
5,Another good season,"The second season of Full House is excellent. The men are more developed now and we can settle in and watch the children grow up. Jessie's hair has been cut short and he's tackling his music career.Still cheesy, but that's okay. Sometimes we need a dose of what life could be like in our make-believe worlds. We meet the Beach Boys for the first time in Full House as they begin singing (They are seen in other episodes throughout the series run).This is just an overall good show!"
1,pure garbage,"Drink a bottle of honey, melted chocolate, and suger and you'll get this show. A pure waste of time, no talent. This show is so incredibly unrealistic. Sometimes i felt like killing the dad, is he gay or what? Neat, cumpulsive, and a sick obsesion with hugging ... Pure pathetic garbage!"
4,"Really great, family sitcome","My son got this for Christmas and has already watched all the episodes. We got rid of cable because even the kid channels had stuff I didnt want my kids watching, so we are buying videos now, and this is one of my sons favorites. Cute, funny, and good values the Tanner family is great for our family. With my sons birthday coming up, he already has requested another season..."
5,FH 2,Love it. Great series. It is great to relive the magic of Full House all over again and again and again!
1,Great show -- beware poor DVD quality,"The show is one of the few available that can entertain really young kids and yet remain ""watchable"" for adults. That said, Warner cut corners on making the DVD. There is no additional content other than the programs that aired. But the real shame is the sound -- they put this series out in Dolby 1.0. So if you have a home theater setup, the only sound that will play is a very, very tinny soundtrack coming out of the CENTER CHANNEL ONLY!!! They could have spent pennies more and released it with Dolby 2.0, which would play out of your main stereo speakers. As it is, there is no advantage to buying the DVD over taping the shows off the air (for time-shifting) other than convenience, and the shows are on heavy rotation on the cable channels. PLUS -- taping them off cable or satellite, the shows sound 100% BETTER!!If you are willing to put up with this kind of ripoff production quality, the shows are charming and really quite funny, once you get into them."
5,endless laughter,"oh my gosh this show used to my favorite when i was like 5 years old, im not 18 and still enjoy this show.although sometimes cheesy with the music during sad moments and constantly hugging its still something fun to poke at because thats not what really families are like.my family isn't like the tanners but dj, stephanie, and michelle's personalities are a little part of me and my younger sister, stephanie. [coincidence].going away to college and leaving my family, this show will def. remind of all the fun times i had together with my own watching this show and just how much i love them, just like the tanner family love each other."
3,Kids love this stuff,"The ""TGIF"" set from the late 80s will remember Full House fondly, and now my 4-year-old is hooked on it. These are charmingly safe, funny, harmless, and entertaining shows, great for kids."
2,Not as expected,"Someone gave us 15 pounds of pecans in shells and neither the picks or this nutcracker will do what I expected them to do. The tips on the picks are too thick to work well and the nuts just slide out the side of of the nutcracker, so I had to spend some more money and get a good nutcracker to do the job correctly. Unfortunately I had thrown away the packaging on this one before I found out it was so bad, so can't return it for a refund or I would. Also, the unit seems to be plated and will probably rust over time."
3,Good for price,"Good for price, seeing how I couldn't find any locally. A little on the cheap side, but should last a while..."
2,Poor Quality,These are not the lobster / nut crackers you grew up with. They rusted up (both the crackers and the pics) within the first month and were very flimsy when trying to crack crustaceans. Threw them out.
3,As you'd expect,"Standard nut cracker. A bit narrow and not as ergonomically comfortable as some newer designs, but it works. Since it is metal, I hope it will last a long time. My previous modern, plastic-handled cracker broke after several months use."
4,Does the job,"I haven't had it long enough to see if it's durable but, so far, it has been working very well."
1,My cracker broke!,"Worked OK at first, but it just couldn't handle my nuts! Used the cracker to crack almonds pretty regularly as snacks for the past few weeks, and I noticed the connecting metal (between the two levers) had started to bend and became disconnected from the holding bolt. Now that it's bent and loosened, I can't get the pressure necessary to crack the nuts. Might work better for nuts with thinner shells, but, for my purposes, this guy just didn't hold up."
2,Had promise,"I saw this on netflix, I try to have an open mind when it comes to low budget horror. I will say this Episode 50 started out promising, but it very quickly got lost. The acting by the cast was really bad. It seemed like they started with an interesting idea but after 45 min the producers didn't know how they wanted to end it. I sortof got the feeling the writers wanted to either push a christian ""anti-paranormal"" agenda or they wanted to make fun of it."
4,I was Looking at the Ceiling - Comment,"Adams shows great versitility in this piece. There are entertaining references to American musicals. The music is, simply, fun to listen too. The voices are excellent, the production is well executed. It has an interesting plot, attractive characters, tunes you can whistle (almost) - what more can you want?"
2,Not for large wood,"This ax did not work well on large pieces of wood, also after only using it a few times the blade developed notches in it. It may work if you have small pieces of wood but not good for splitting."
5,Fantastic splitting axe,I can't recommend this axe enough. Cut through my logs like a hot knife through butter.
5,Best ax we've ever owned,After chopping about 5 cords of wood with this I can confidently say it's the best ax out there. I'm 6 foot 2 and the shortness of the handle is something to be very aware of but it also makes the ax very controllable. We also bought one of these for a gift for my dad after being so happy with it.
2,Silly Movie - Silly Fun - the best thing about it is that I am in it! LOL,"The movie was made in my back yard so to speak so was intrigued - however it is a very silly movie. I know a lot of people cast as extras, myself included, otherwise I wouldn't even bother. Some good acting, and some horrible acting. Ann Margaret was really one of the best ... not a good representation of a real renaissance festival (I know I worked at one) but it is what it is. Sadly."
2,"Bad, bad, bad","I was drawn in by the promise of a movie with a unique setting -- as far as I know, this is the only movie that is set at a Renaissance Faire, which I thought was brilliant. Christina Ricci and Matthew Lillard are also good actors, and I was hoping for a cute little movie. But within minutes, my excitement took a sharp turn. The acting and storyline are just plain BAD. The performances are so over-the-top, especially by Chris Wylde, that they were more akin to what you'd expect from a goofy kids movie (like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers). This was so true that I thought that kids might have been the audience they wanted, except that there were some definite adult themes, and so it really became this aimless, horrible thing. I don't know how so many well-known actors got roped into doing this flick, but it was pathetic and a struggle to watch the whole way through."
5,The best show!!!,This season is a must have for all Gilmore Girls fans! Definitely one of the best so far!
2,Disappointing,"I was so excited to get the fifth season of Gilmore Girls in the mail! I thought surely this season would be better than the fourth season (which wasn't terrible, but had more cons than pros, in my opinion). But it's been a major disappointment. The only good thing about this season is that Luke and Lorelai are finally dating. Rory is no longer the smart, innocent girl we liked in the earlier seasons. Instead, she's only interested in trapping herself a boyfriend and sleeping around. Her relationship with her mom is extremely two-dimensional, and the witty banter that was such a delight in other seasons is now slow, lacking in references, and just plain boring. It seems the writers have exchanged the intelligence of the show for a soap opera feel.While there were a few good episodes in this season, I wouldn't recommend buying the entire set. It just isn't worth it."
5,More of my good friends the Gilmores,"This continues to be a source of enjoyment to me with witty lines, fun situations, superb acting. I'm so glad you were able to keep the actors, just a shame you lost the best writers. Keep producing the best of longtime story lines."
2,Wither the youthful rebellion?,"Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of Rory's college sojourn is her refusal to sample the delights of college, indeed adult life. She does not drink (or only does so in the most disgusting moderation; really, it would be better if she had more regard for the feelings of others) or experiment with drugs (no one expected Rory to go the Trainspotting route, but how about a joint? Such abstention is bad for the soul) nor does she really fool around with young men. The show started to go wrong when Rory decided to go to Yale instead of Harvard; the result? NOTHING CHANGED. Rory was home every other episode, it was Chilton+. Nothing new. The episode where the Independence Inn burned down was the episode where GG jumped the shark; to whit, when it reached its high point and began its decline. Said decline is nowhere more evident that this, season 5, the second weakest season."
3,Gilmore Girls has been better,"I love Gilmore Girls, but I don't like the fifth season as much. I don't like how Rory is with Logan; he is a horrible influence. I don't like how Rory quits Yale, and how her life seems to go downhill. However, I do like how Emily and Richard end up back together, and Lorelai and Luke end up back together. But overall, the first four seasons were better."
4,Could be better,"Although Season 5 is not as bad as Season 6, it isn't one of the best overall. Rory is going downhill all the way, being very unRorylike in some ways and making bad choices. She drops out of Yale among other things. This was a disappointment, but had enough going for it that it's worth a watch if you're out of Gilmore and don't want to rerun previous seasons right away."
3,One of the worst seasons.,"This season started with Dean being back in Rory's life, so annoying. Ended with Rory leaving Yale after stealing a boat. Just a bunch of ""WTF?"" in this season. Season 6 is destroyed by the lead in from season 5. Just a very disappointing season, still better than other shows but the worst of the Gilmore Girls."
4,Gilmore Girls Season 7 DVD Purchase,Very fast delivery. Was in very good condition. All Dvd's were there and all played. Episode Guide was there but Gimoreism's booklet was missing.
4,gilmore girls the compleat 5th season,"I am official the worlds bigest fan of this show and all of the quirky stars hollow regulars. i own all the seasons and have watched them all 1000 times i am addicted. Season 5 is without doubt the best season yet i have watched it so many times i know each episode buy hart and can repeat the script word for word. I am Australian so am on the edge of my seat waiting for season six to be delived to my door until then i will have to watch season 5 again not that i mind but my boyfriend is ready to break all the discs so hopefully 6 will be here in a fw days. anyway i would say don't walk, run to get your copy of tvs best seris eva. go on do it you know you want to : )"
3,Love Gilmore Girls! but missing disk 6!!!,"I was disappointed when I discovered that within my box set I have 2 disk 5 for season 5 and no disk 6. I returned it to Amazon, received a replacement and still the same problem. I need to figure out how to fix this without running around in circles"
2,gilmore girls - season 5,I got the dvd and watched 5 of the dvds. disc 2 did not play. I sent back to amazon for a refund. They should have now. When will I get my refund.??
1,liberal propganda trying to be funny,"more President Bush bashing . . . comments about ""lying swift boat captains"" . . . . lines like ""privilege white males"" . . . . people jumping in out of bed. people having affaires and the adulterer is supposed to be the ""good girl"". lines like ""I am sick of Jesus . . . "". a person trying to be ""hispanic"" with a farce of an fake accent. a person trying to be ""french"" with a silly fake accent. And if that is not off putting enough they try to great a ""quirky"" character . . . that works in all the town's businesses . . . saying and doing off teh wall stuff . . . that isn't funny or cute in a quirky way . . . he is this character that is kinda forced on the audience. This show has deteriorated VERY much from the first season."
5,"GG, my new fixation","I can't believe how overpriced every other site is that sells "" discounted"" dvd's. I bought this new for 1/3 the price elsewhere.Gilmore Girls is one of those series you can watch many times and always see something new and hilarious."
3,rattle rattle,The Dvd series from the Gilmore Girls was bought a gift. It was brought to me by the receiver. we opened the box and found the reason for the noise was the plastic filing system was broken and floating arouns in the box.I know the dvd's was listed as repackaged. I didnt expect the boken plastic and would have liked to has seen that in the description. The discs looked fine.I was disappointed. I suggest better product information.regina
3,Gilmore Girls 5th Season,"Order received in a timely manner. Package rattled as if broken. It was a gift but carefully opened the wrapper and found the rattling to be from the plastic casing not the Discs themselves. The DVDs appeared fine, and have not heard of any viewing problem. No return information or receipt of any kind was included in the package. Overall okay experience."
3,Gilmore Girls 5th season,"The box set was in good condition, there are few scratches on the dvds that cause some jumps in certain episodes."
5,Great!,I love Gilmore Girls and this is definitely one of their best seasons! The product came in great shape and in a very timely manner!
3,gilmore girls,"I love Gilmore Girls and have every season. The disks work great but the case was broken when I bought it including the part that holds the 6 dvds together. This is very inconvenient since every time I go to open it, the dvds fall out."
1,Not satisfied!,"I was buying this DVD as a birthday gift and didn't receive it even after the estimated delivery date. Because the USPS lost it during transit, the company couldn't do anything about it so they gave me a full refund of my money and I was out of a birthday gift. So now I have to take time and look for it again somewhere else. Although they did respond quickly about my problem."
3,good,this is a good show. but when i received this idem the case was broken. no big deal just kind of annoying.
3,Good,Thought that the product was supposed to be new in packaging but it came upwrapped. All the disc play pretty good. There are a few scratchs on one of the disc but I had them cleaned and now they work good. Shipping very quick.
5,It's about time.,"I thought this was a great season. I got a little tired of the rift between Emily/Richard and Lorelai relationship. BUT I loved the new Logan/Rory relationship. It was a refreshing change to see some new characters as well as all of the old favorites. I was getting tired of seeing Rory with guys who just drained her and did not challenge her. I do not feel that Logan would be a good match forever, but it is nice to see her stepping out of her comfort zone and having to work for something as well as have fun in college, which I think is a better portrayal of college life. This is definately a series that I will be sad to see end when it finally does. There is none other like it."
5,Can't get enough,"I've been watching Gilmore Girls on and off since it started but being in Australia I've found it harder to get to see the show.. Buying it from amazon was great, it worked on my dvd player and it arrived on time and in good condition. I will use amazon again in the future.."
5,The best serie drama always,"This is a very good serie, with humor and drama, starring by lauren graham a very good actress.This season was especial, with more love and drama. You have to watch it.Creo que es la serie de televisión que más me ha gustado en la vida. entretenida, divertida, familiar, por eso compré todas las temporadas. Esta temporada en especial fue muy buena, con mucho amor y drama. Hay que verla."
2,disapointing,I never watched the series when it was first aired but the DVDs were suggested to me by a friend. The first three seasons are wonderful and season four is good. I am part way through season five and I think I'm just done. Characters have turned into caricatures and Rory has turned into a snob. I don't like the Logan character and Luke and Lorelei (after all the waiting) don't seem very passionate about each other. It's been hard to watch without hitting the fast forward button.
5,Gilmore Girls just keeps getting better,"being an active Gilmore Girls fan I really can see the changes that have been made since season one. with all the emotion and character put into this show, this show truly will make you think. if you have been watching Gilmore Girls and are contemplating buying this season I say you should. This show has such wit, such sheer splendor you will cast off your seat. just a few minutes of this show and you will be hooked. a true show for years to come."
5,Gilmore Girls DVD,Bought as a Christmas gift to a young lady is trying to get the full series of the Gilmore Girls.
2,$8 DVD not a good buy,"I recently purchased Gilmore Girls season 5, when it went on sale for $8. I love this show and was excited to add to my DVD collection, but realized how horrible the quality was of these particular DVDs. The sound is awful! I need to return these DVDs. I would gladly pay full price, so that I could receive a quality product. The two star rating is for the DVD quality, not the rating of this show."
5,Best Preserving Book on Earth,"Not many technical books are this memorable, but ""Fine Preserving"" is one I cannot forget. I checked it out of my library for years until the sad day it disappeared. At the time there was no way to find it except searching through stores which specialized in rare and out of print books. I then added it to my birthday wish list, then waited years before getting my own copy. What makes this book special though is unique recipes and interesting combinations rather than the specifics of preserving. You'll never need another idea book for beautiful and interesting gifts! The only thing not totally enjoyable were a few of the comments by Ms. Fisher. But I'm so glad she brought the book to our attention! One of my favorite all time books."
1,dont confuse this with mesh stl,This is not Mesh STL. So if that is what your after move on. Mesh STL has changed their name to Modern Day Zero. 2004 album excellent . 2007 not so much
5,"Not Just One Genius, But Two...","Oh the miraculous humming of Glenn Gould! You must have heard this particular recording to say you have lived. To Not have heard it is like Not having Ever witnessed a sunset.Gould channels J.S.Bach like no other performer, providing the listener a chance at looking clearly into the mind of not just one genius, but two. The recording quality is so real and warm that you feel as if you are sitting next to Gould on the piano bench. You could hear a pin drop.If you crave intimate, serious moments with a sensitve and brilliant artist who plays just for you, this is your disc. Devise your own theory on why he hums..."
1,"Not what Bach composed, folks!","The so called ""Goldberg Variations"" is one of the greatest compositions for the keyboard. But in Bach' s time that meant cembalo not fortepiano. I would strongly recommend that you respect Bach' s intentions and hear this work in the instrument that the master himself chose. There is a magnificent recording in the OPUS111 label with the immensely talented Pierre Hantai. You won' t find a better recording, certainly not this one, or Gould' s digital remake. Glenn Gould liked to believe that he knew better than the composers, well, he did not."
3,"Great Performance -- But Mono, and Tweeked","I bought this recording because of its historical significance. However, I was surprised to find that it was recorded in mono. No where on the outside of the CD does it say ""Mono"". Sony is mis-representing their product by omitting this. Perhaps it's unfashionable to mention that a recording is mono, but I like to know these things. Another thing I don't like about the recording is how the gain is turned up on the louder passages in an attempt by the engineer to make the music sound more exciting. I prefer that the engineers leave the recording alone, and let the performance speak on its own."
2,Gould reconsidered and so should we,"Gould's '55 recording of the Goldberg variations was a challenging statement from a very young man. Perhaps it needed to be played this way, at least once, or perhaps Gould needed to play it this way at that time.He thought better of it and re-recorded the work in '82 and it is this last interpretation that will stand the test of time. It is an interpretation that is much closer to the accepted sound, but how beautiful it is! Bach doesn't need eccentric rhythms and tempi to gain attention and it turned out that neither did Gould. You can still hear his vocalise (love it or loathe it - I love it), but the passion, depth and strength of the later work overshadows his earlier effort and nearly everyone else's efforts too. Hear them both and then decide for yourselfRIchard Maycock"
3,Not sure what the hype is about,"While this book has some fairly original concepts (telling it from the perspective of a political liason that's escorting BP, drawing in some aspects of world politics, etc...) the execution doesn't feel great. All the characters feel too one-dimensional, and (SPOILER!!) the inclusion of some supernatural aspects near the end felt out of place. The interesting parts of international politics/warfare were just too glossed over. This book isn't terrible, and maybe it's just me, but I thought that this whole story (including Enemy of the State) would have done better under another writer. As for the art, it was good, but not enough to overcome the dialogue and plot execution."
3,Great lamp but part of it didn't work when arrived,"Love this lamp as it is exactly what we need but unfortunately, one of the lights didn't work when it came. I'm now trying to figure out how to get a replacement bulb and I hope that it's just the bulb. Amazon was nice enough to offer me a discount in case I had to go out and buy a new bulb but it's a huge hassle and I hope that it WAS just the bulb and not the lamp itself because this is perfect for us. Love the adjustable height. Also the heat intensity is a little problematic but...."
3,Looks good for CPO,"I see some wear, but it's in great shape. You have to use certain type of cord, otherwise it will not go into the socket. I noticed the RPM on my saw is way slower than my friend's (same saw, but new). The cord socket makes this saw bulkier than other saws and in my toolbox. Buy Skil Mag77 or Makita Hypoid Mag."
2,"OK, but not much for real Dog People","Writing is good, story is so-so. I certainly hope that no one thinks that these ""dog people"" know what the hell they are doing, because they don't. Lots of ideas that go nowhere in particular.Probably wouldn't be so critical if I weren't a REAL Dog Person."
3,"Good, but there might be better","I guess there are two issues. First, I am not sure if the nutrition label was there when I bought this, but whatever: this item is fairly high in fat content.Second, I like my Indian a bit spicy, and I thought this was a bit bland by that standard.Still, lots of dark greens are the secret to longevity: enjoy!"
3,Interesting Concept but lacking in exection,"I REALLY like the concept and plotline behind this game... that said... I have to admit to dislike the ""doom"" style gameplay...it oculd have been muhc better with very little effort.like for example... giving in some Roleplaying/Adventure Aspects... like letting the protaganist make their choice in play would have been much more interesting."
3,"Incredibly soft, fun, but Emily isn't on it","I love Emily the Strange, not so much her cats. The photograph made it look like Emily was actually on the blanket. But the fact that it's as soft as one of her cats makes up for it. I just hope washing it doesn't ruin how soft it is."
4,Neat little camera bag,"I've use this bag for my entry level SLR, and it fits the SLR, lens, battery packs and instruction booklets with plenty of room to spare. I could probably fit another tele-lens in here if I had one. I was disappointed that my JOBY Gorilla Pod doesn't fit very well, but I was able to fit it diagonally in one of the pockets. There are a lot of velcro connectors inside the bag which makes it very flexible, but it's not very easy to design or move these velcro straps since they get stuck to the sides of the inside and don't want to move. My only other complaint is that the snap-clip is a unique shape that isn't very easy to match together. Other than that, I love the design of this bag (I got the camo/black version) and it gets me and my camera where we need to go."
2,dash mat review,The mat itself fit great. It looked better than expected. The only draw back is that it did not come with velcro attachments in order to secure it.
1,silverado dash mat,I actually ordered this for a Chevy Silverado and twice they sent it for a Cavalier. I ended up having to pay to have it returned the second time because I had to say it was my fault. grrr I am sure if it was for the right rig it would have b een great.
5,On Kingdon Business: Tranforming Missions Through Entrepreneurial Stategies,"This is an excellent book for this interested in participating in foreign missionary work abroad either for a limited duration or a life time. This book is divided in two parts: why new strategies on doing missions must be implemented (it advocates doing so through business endeavors that are favorable to building national infrastructures) and examples of how these strategies have yielded results and those that have not. The book is a wealth of information on a paradigm shift for doing foreigh missions, a necessary read for all involved in such a calling."
5,authentic arabian horse names,"This is simply a wonderful book! One can almost feel they are there, withthe stories and the history. Beautifully written and appointed, it wasa great help to me, I found the perfect name for my new foal. I couldn'tbe happier, this copy was actually a gift for a friend because I likedmy first copy so much."
4,Interesting and usefull,"Nice Pictures, interesting History and a usefull dictionary for choosing a meaningfull name for your horse! I will highly recimend it!"
1,Boring and awful names,I ordered this book hoping to find names with a noble meaning.. Who wants to call one's horse GROCER...Delivery boy etc..Awful book waste of money. Waste of time and one would think such a beautiful book would have amazing names for Arabian Horses.I would throw it away but it cost too much.. It's worthless and disappointing..
4,commercial but true,"obviously this CD (on SONY MUSIC btw) is quite a ""commercial"" sounding album. But I'd picture hearing some of these songs on AM radio maybe. Understanding abit where Finley comes from, I certainly appreciate his personal expression he gives us through this CD. I hear influences of 70s rock, country (one song sounds almost like johnny cash-style), leonard cohen, & modern pop music. For pop music, it is very good. For Finley Quaye it is very good. I certainly like listening to it. I can understand how some people are touchy about listening to this music, as it deals with subjects that not everyone can appreciate, but he does so subtly. I see abit of rasta shine through the gloss. There is still hope, and the naysayers I guess they just don't know."
1,What Happened?,"This is one the most boring albums I have ever purchased. Whopee, Finley is in love...but he sure lost the beat. What happened to the edge and funk of Maverick?This is pathetic singer-songwriter pap. There is no reggae,no intresting insturmentation and the lyrics are god awful."
1,I have much less than love for this album,"I first saw Finley Quaye open for Ben Harper in 1997 and I quickly thereafter went out and bought Maverick a Strike. What an album his first one is- without a doubt his best to date. Vanguard grew on me after several months of listening to it, and I think it is also a strong work. I can't, however, seem to take this latest CD of his seriously. Look how many people are selling thiers used through Amazon- over 60! What does that tell you? Well, it tells you that if you buy this CD new then I have a bridge to sell you. If you are a big FQ fan like myself, buy a used copy and see for yourself. But don't have high expectations; simply put, Quaye's talent does not come through in this album. It's a piece of fluff."
1,The final demonstration,"this album is the final demonstration that Finley Quaye is not a musician. His producers and all the working team around him made ""Maverick a Strike"" a great album and ""Vanguard"" a nice comeback, but he still isn't able to write a good song (maybe The Emperor, on ""Vanguard"", is the only decent one he ever wrote); useless calling William Orbit and Beth Orton to give a little hand... this album is a lame pop record without soul..."
3,interesting,"I read it for a class, it was very informative. I would suggest it to everyone who wants to know more on thev subject"
2,Beware! Not as expected...,"I have the set pictured. I love it and wanted one as a gift for my daughter. The set I received is not in the box pictured. It came packaged in plastic so I cannot even open it to look at it. All of the parts in my set are metal - except for the ""plunger"" disk. This one has a metal handle and possibly a metal tube. (I don't know because I can't open it and still give it as a gift or return it.) I am concerned that the plastic screw parts on this new set will not last. (I have not had good luck with plastic parts keeping their threads.) I probably would have not purchased this had I known it was mostly plastic. Alas, it was the only tube decorator that I could find."
3,Cake Decorating syringe kit,"The product is ok, however, the plunger is made of a hard plastic and has some cracking tendencies. Otherwise it is of good quality."
2,Item not what is shown in picture,"Just a friendly warning. I got this item today, and it isn't packaged at all like the picture shows (therefore not what I expected). It's packaged in plastic (not a box), and the canister is a different color than in the picture. I haven't actually used it yet, and I'm still debating whether I will keep it. If I do decide to keep and use it I will update my review on how it actually works. I just wanted to let others know what to expect (or not to expect as the case may be) in order not to be taken by surprise when they get this."
4,A worthy book for the bar exam.,"It is a good book for the exam approach in general (I read it last week), but there is nothing new or useful to me.It might be better for first or second time examinees. My next attempt is 2.12."
1,not much...unless you are a REALLY lame organizer...,"I bought this book as required reading for a class. IT was EXPENSIVE. And frankly a waste for me. If you really want help passing the bar focus, focus, focus. Just accept the fact if you want to pass the bar exam (this is my second)that you will need to spend a LOT of time studying, memorizing writing and doing MBE's. And I don't mean to just push yourself to your limit. I mean you push your self BEYOND YOUR current limit of S-T-u-d-y-i-n-g; not drinking. Get on eor two peeps that are committed like you SHOULD be and review together. And study A LOT more than you did in law school. If you want a good book buy 'Strategies & Tactics for the MBE' (Multistate Bar Exam) (Paperback) by Emmanuel instead. Start it 2 weeks before your bar prep class and study every. single. page. Oh yeah, get lots of sleep the month before the exam b/c you'll be getting less sleep the closer you get to D-day. But get 7 hours every chance you get."
3,Works fine,"Assuming that you know what you are doing, this product works fine with a number of software products. It produces a reasonable number of voucher checks @about .07 each. When you are providing a small number of checks for a number of companies, it's the way to go."
2,"Adequate, but overpriced and difficult to use","Suitable product, but by the time you add the cost of their software, (necessary to print checks) your time to set it up, more time to run a print job of checks, and the excessive cost of their paper, you could purchase pre-printed checks from any of hundreds of companies that sell them for less. And all without the hassle of setting up and using the least user friendly and unnecessarily complex software I have used in many years. This paper ought to cost about 1/2 of the price it is being sold for. If I had not already invested in their dreadful software, I would not be using this. I regret having bought into this check printing system, and would not recommend it to others. Save your time and save your money. Find yourself a check printing company on the web, and avoid the aggravation of dealing with poorly designed software and overpriced supplies."
3,"Full of anecdotes,very consumer oriented ,no detail","whilst the concept of 1:1 is appealing, and the case studies suggest that lots of companies are succeeding, there is little practical help re implementation. It's too consumer oriented a little less evangelism and more balanced approach would have been useful. suggest read : Ian Gordon Relationship Marketing Wayland & Cole - Customer Connections Regis McKenna - Real Time for a more in depth view of this."
5,Educational,"Very educational, very detailed, have to read over and over, like a manual in order to grasp all details and implement."
1,Tired of being probed.,"Nothing profound here folks. You probably don't even want to hear my ""one to one"" take on this book, since it may not sell more books. But I, for one, am tired of being probed by corporations eager for the next way to milk more of my meager funds. One to one marketing is insidious and, to be frank, quite frightening. I won't allow it. I don't want a computer generated drone to welcome me at every turn, at the bank, on the phone, wherever. Peppers and Rogers are arrogant and incredibly shortsighted, unable to see the downside of an increasingly individualized, contrived, privatized, and personalized existence. They seem to rely on the ignorance of the general populace, consoling eachother in corporate boardrooms, unaware that one day people will just stand up and say ""no"" to their one to one utopia"
5,"Terrific: practical, lucid and insightful","I absolutely loved this highly readible book, chockful of practical insights into the challenges ofmarketing in a one-to-one, interactice era. Together with Peppers/Rogers' earlier bestseller, The One to One Future, this bookwill set new standard for well into the next century. Great work!"
4,A book for close customer relationships,"I did not complete reading this book. However, on the chapters so far I have read, this book shows how future organizations should address the needs of individual customers.I am subscribed to the mailing list of 1-to-1 organization. More than the book, I learned a lot of new concepts and examples from the mailing list. I have also saved these mails so that I can refer to them in future.A good book for anyone interested to build a close customer relationships and customizing customer needs."
5,AMAZING,"This game is amazing. When i played the demo it was amazing. I knew i had to have the game. You can freeze time, rewind time, or slow it down for about 3-4 seconds. The guns are amazing. Ill let you find out what they are. I recommend this game for xbox 360 or play station 3 either one is sick-nasty. What i think the best part about TimeShift is the online multiplayer. You can have 2-16 players in a game. The possibilities are endless in multiplayer. Im still finding new stuff in it. The storyline may be a bit confusing but you can try to do it or go online and find a walkthrough. The first person shooter is unbelivable in this game. Then the graphics are great as well. Its what you would expect from a next generation game. I think that this is the second best game for xbox 360 besides Halo 3. I would definitly suggest adding this game to your cart."
2,Hyped and Hooked,"I feel like a fish that was hyped in to buying this game only to realize I was hooked and yanked from my 'comfort zone'... When I saw the video hype of this game, I should've realized that there are games, and there are games that should be movies and not games.The only thing different about this FPS is that it is on my XBox and not a computer. Nothing remarkable about the graphics or the gameplay at all. Does Goodwill or the Salvation Army take game donations, because I don't think I can give this one away.Remarkable disappointment."
2,I spent months with this game...,"I worked at Vivendi (Sierra is a 'fake' company owned by Vivendi). While there, I spent a few months testing this awful game. Total lack of plot, painfully easy gameplay, followed by ridiculously difficult gameplay, sprawling maps that appear open but are actually strictly linear... if you accidentally travel outside of where they want you to go (not always obvious), you'll be lost for hours. Oh, and if you wander too far and find a way *around* where they want you to go, you'll find yourself stuck, having to reset to the last save.This game was originally set for the original X-Box, but took so long to develop that they had to upgrade it to 360 status. The problem is that they didn't upgrade enough.This game leads you by the nose, and is fun for twenty minutes or so, before getting frustratingly familiar.Please don't buy this game unless you've already played through it and for some reason really like it. Renting this game will save you money."
1,Time Shift,"This game is soo damn boring, the missions are not even fun their just annoying, and the graphics are not all that good eather compared to other first person shooters, if you are looking for a good first person shooter play call of duty 4, your not going to find a better game than that"
4,Good,This game has the best rag doll physics that could every be put into a game other than that there really isnt anything else
4,"Good, but could have been better","After playing the demo for this game, I was pretty excited about getting it. However, after playing the actual game, I was a little disappointed. It's still a good game, but it could have been better. It definitely has some interesting game play to it."
3,OK Game,"Bought this game because it looked interesting...after playing it, I have come to the determination that this is just an average game and nothing special."
2,Typical FPS Shooter with a VERY confusing storyline,"I thought the trailer was fun and that the concept of manipulating time to aid in battle was quite creative, BUT when you actually buy the game and play it, it's a different story. Speaking of ""story"" - the storyline for the game is so fragmented and confusing that you'll be wondering what it was you actually accomplished when you finish the game (I logged in about 7hrs of total playing time to finish this game). You'll be saving your game progress a lot (trust me, you WILL). The battles get redundant and the puzzles to solve in regards to manipulating time are no-brainers and not that difficult. Aside from the redundant battles, slow time power charging, and so-so weapons, this game was a huge disappointment. I recommend that you RENT the game and not shell out $59.99 for it. I have yet to piece out the storyline. Little artsy tidbits of flashbacks and scenes of a Windows desktop doesn't tell much about the story. It sure left me disappointed."
3,Decent Game,I've only played the first level or two. So far its a decent game. The controls are a bit clunky and gameplay is a little slow but its worth picking up if you can find a cheap copy.
3,Nice overview of Visual Studio,"The book deals with mostly an overview of VS .Net features. They give a general guideline on how to write VS solutions / projects - components - scripts, amd how to debug programs. I bought the book mostly since it's the only one I found that discusses VSIP. I did not find a lot of information on VSIP 7 pages long chapter which barly discusses an overview. The book authors tried their samples on both VS 2002 and VS 2003. I would not recommend this book to people who are brand new VS users or experts on VS. I would recommend it for some users how are looking for some extra shortcuts / functionality here and there. I'm giving this book 3 stars since I would have expected a bit more in debth analysis and more samples."
3,Has Good Overview. Could be better,"It covers many topics around Visual Studio.net. Its coverage of Debugging(Chap 3), Macros(Chap 8) are good.One missing piece is Web Services with Visual Studio.net. I didn't find any related information in it. Also, serveral times, when I needed some information about Visual Studio.net, I couldn't find it in this book. Though I've been using VS.net for several months, I never needed most of the information in this book."
4,Good Beginning Text for Preaching,"This book looked really promising when I saw it advertised, but I haven't found it to be quite as helpful as I'd hoped. I thought it would be a resource that would give me some fresh ideas for preaching, but what I've found is a really good introduction to preaching. Some of the standard homiletics texts have not been updated to deal with media and the emerging movement; Nelson does a good job of handling those things and intriducing the basics of putting a message together. While it has not been as helpful to me as I had anticipated, I would highly recommend it to someone beginning a preaching career or to someone who has not really looked into the use of media in preaching."
5,Sacred Road by David Lanz,"This book is great!!!! i started playing piano when i was young and have progressed greatly over time. This book helped me bring out emotions that couldn't be expressed in classical. My personal favorite has to be variations on a theme from Pachelbel's Cannon in D, although i still greatly enjoy playing his other works such as Dreamer's Waltz, A Path with Heart, Nocturne, Before the Last Leaf Falls, Beloved, Nights in White Satin, and A Whiter Shade of Pale. His music can bring out emotions never attainable from classical. This is one book that i will go back to and play whenever i have time."
5,Good Collection,"This is an impressive collection of George Jones standards that have held up well after all of these years. This one combines songs from 1972-1982....an era not relished for it's ""Country"" music. I dont think there's a bad song on the CD (and there are 22); in fact, in my opinion, every single one of these should be number #1's. There are some real gems here that may have been forgotten, to include: ""If Drinking' Dont Kill Me"", ""The Door"", ""Once You've Had the Best"", and ""We Can Make It"". George has recorded so many songs, that some of the ones listed here may not ring a bell when they are mentioned, but you'll recognize each and everyone after you hear the first note. Stellar collection of original recordings."
5,"George Jones, Anniversary: Ten Years of Hits","George Jones is, without question, the king of country vocalizing. The very fact that they have selected a decade of golden hits makes it plain that they were not able to select hits before and after this ""anniversary"" time frame. Therefore some of my very favorite selections from the George Jones' hit list are not included. But, those that are included are true jewels of country music. ""He Stopped Loving Her Today"", ""The Grand Tour"" are among his very best but I could cite the whole album as ""favorites"". This album is available at a bargain price but the music within is priceless! Bill Joe Nix"
4,I Love This CD!,"I love it almost as much as I love gardening! I also have the Perennials CD by Allan Armitage, and they complement each other nicely. I love being able to sort the plant database by flower height, foliage height, and usage (landscaping or container).It would have been helpful to also be able to sort this list by color.I also love the beautiful slide show of annuals set to music."
3,Sweet,"It was a sweet movie to watch but highly doubt that would really happen. But still, it was an enjoyable movie."
5,The Christmas Card,This has turned into one of my all time favorite holiday movies!!! I highly recommend it to everyone...suitable for the entire family!
5,LOVE this movie!!,"I make a point to watch this movie on the Hallmark channel many times every Christmas. It won viewer's choice for favorite movie to air on Hallmark Channel, and for a very good reason. I had to order this movie, because it is a feel good movie and fits in well with the spirit of Christmas. I am glad that I am able to buy it for my own collection. Can't wait to watch it again and again."
5,Great Xmas movie,Great christmass story I watch it multiple times during the Xmas season. This gets pulled out with the xmas decorations/.
3,"Great cover, disappointing results","The cover is very nice, the summary of the plot sounds just like it's up my alley for nice, romantic, holiday movies, but the acting is very stiff and the editing leaves something to be desired. Even that could be forgiven if the movie itself portrayed some useful character growth or plot points.I was waiting for the scene where my eyes would tear up, and my heart would rejoice at the happiness of some moment, and it didn't come. I ended the movie disappointed overall."
2,sugar overload,"My wife and I very much wanted to like this movie. It would have been so much better if they toned it down a bit. The actors are attractive, the scenery beautiful, everything well meaning, but the music is unrelentingly sappy(none would have been better), the dialogue syrupy (hard to fight back the groans)and the romance/story too much, too obvious, too ""you're going to love this story forever after-ish"". Not our cup of sugar, but if find yourself drawn to Kinkaid paintings, go for it."
2,Terrible acting and a predictable ending,"I purchased this movie from Amazon based on its good ratings from other viewers. It was terrible! The acting was appalling, including the handsome soldier who I very much wanted to connect with. The story was too syrupy for me, and completely predictable. There are much better Christmas movies out there, including ""The Family Stone""."
2,Disappointing,"Perhaps I've seen too many good movies (most of them older movies) lately but this one really disappointed me. I read all the great reviews and ordered it expecting more than what I saw in this movie. The performances were stiff and wooden, there was little chemistry between the Cody (Newton) and Faith (Evans), the story seemed elementary and didn't flow well from one scene to the other. In fact I saw little chemistry between most of the actors in this movie--the ""acting"" between the players was obvious, especially between Newton and Evans, even the last scene lacked chemistry between the two, when you can't get the final love scene emotionally charged there is definitely something missing--dropping the takeout plate and throwing your arms wide open isn't exactly a tender, touching love scene--Newton at least did better there than Evans. I don't mind obvious movie endings but this one made me wonder where the ""magic"" was with any of the characters. Wish I had saved my money."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,This movie is very poorly written and acted. It's just plain boring. I just don't understand why so many have rated it so highly. You should expect much more from a film than this one delivers.
4,Lovely movie,"This movie was really nice. It's less about the war, than it is about a soldier coming home to find a place to belong. It was refreshing because it takes place in a small town, and the main character is an attractive young woman who loves the small town she lives in, and feels no need to move away to a place that is more sophisticated and glitzy. It's a heartwarming movie, and well worth watching."
5,Wonderful!!!,This movie leaves you with a warm and fuzzy feeling. It makes you want to live there and be a part of that family. It would be great if they came out with a sequel.
4,Good story for modern day,This is good choice for a christmas movie in light of recent years and on going events. Has a good story and good presentstion.
5,the christmas card,"I think I will watch this DVD all year round it is the very best christmas DVD and if you have not seen it yet, please rent or buy it, you will not be sorry."
3,The Christmas Card,"The dialog in the movie is a bit stilted. It's corny and doesn't flow together well. The dialog for Lois Nettleton is awful, and her acting didn't help. But, the story is a nice one. It reawakened a dream of being married again and of living in a gorgeous log home."
4,mixed opinion,"I'm Army, so I know how Army guys are. The image is too perfect. Army guys are crusty; this shows them as spit and polish all the time. They smoke, they cuss, they aren't perfect gentlemen. The beginning is corny and scripted. The acting at first isn't good. Mortar attack, and it's all taken in stride? No fear, no trauma, no emotion? The good news is the story gets a lot better later in the movie. We liked it quite a bit later. Still, nobody knows where he was from days or weeks into the relationship? Ready to leave the church without saying he got a card in Afghanistan? I don't think so! Still, all in all, we liked the movie."
5,ahhh - verrry enstisting,"I thought this movie was a very moving story,, even though I knew what the ending had to be. I definitely recommend this flic to anyone. This is NOT just another chick flic....."
5,the christmas card,This is one of my all time faves and I can't believe I finally own it. I am a movie buff and this is such a great story.Excellent seller too
1,"Sappy, ..obviously a TV movie.","This 'movie' is a TV movie that romanticises war and 'Christian values'. I could not finish it. Very sappy lines and acting. For example, Jones shows Cody a picture of his girlfriend, and later when Cody meets the girlfriend she has on the same sweater as in the picture! Did they think that we wouldn't recognize her? I would give it zero stars. Koolaid for those who have already had too much."
5,Sweet and touching,"This is a very sweet, clean, family-friendly movie. Its one of my favorites, right up there with Hallmark's Season For Miracles - it has the same tone and theme of welcoming strangers into a family.Cody Cullen is a soldier overseas at Christmastime who receives a Christmas card from well-wishing stranger Faith. He is touched by the card and keeps it close. When a fellow soldier is killed in an attack, he returns to the States to notify and comfort the widow. While there, he also searches for and meets Faith, but never tells her how he knows her. Through a series of events he becomes like a member of Faith's family. When his time is up, he leaves the Christmas Card with a special gift for Faith's family and disappears without saying goodbye. Faith then realizes her feelings for him and tries to catch up with him. Naturally, it is a happily-ever-after fairytale story. :-)"
3,Well worth a watch if you support our soldiers,"I adore the premise and storyline to this movie and have watched it since it came out two years ago, however I have to admit John Newton is my guilty pleasure in it....he's too adorable!Still to be perfectly honest though, even though the story line is wonderul someone as fond of military folk as myself, I just didn't feel that there was any honest chemistry between the two main actors, though their flirtations were cutely played out.I taped it for posterity though!"
5,The Christmas Card,It's such a beautiful story with a wonderful cast. I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.JH
4,It's Great except one thing,Its a Fantastic movie ..except you can't buy it in Closed Captioned I'm deaf the only way I can watch it is on TV and I like watching that one Alot ... its one of my favorites .. but I can't watch it with out captioning .... its one of those movies that makes you feel good at the end ....
5,ROMANCE AND A SOLDIER,THIS WARMED MY HEART AS THE GIRL WRITES CHRISTMAS C ARDS TO SOLDIERS..IT IS IMPORTANT THEY KNOW WE DO CARE AND DO THINK OF THEM AND THE SACRIFICES THEY MAKE. I PURCHASED THIS AS I LOVE THE STORY
4,My new favorite Christmas movie!,"The Christmas Card is a movie set in today's world yet has the warm, feel-good of a time without the commercialism and hustle and bustle that unfortunately is today's world. I don't know about other viewers, but I would like to find myself in a world where life and family means something real. . . the place where the love and support of this family takes you."
5,The Christmas Card,The wife and I found this movie to be excellent for family viewing for all age groups. Excellent Holiday movie without the gutter humor or sexual content that so many of the movies now have.
2,sappy junk,"This Christmas I DVR'd THE CHRISTMAS CARD and BOYFRIEND FOR CHRISTMAS based on amazon recommendations. I have learned my lesson!I guess there are a lot of people here who are into sappy movies, but this is just bad. The acting is terrible and the story is silly. The premise was nice, but ugh ugh ugh. So much bad is going on with this movie that I cannot believe they made it. I did get through it, but ill not be wasting time on movies like this (lifetime movie of the week) ever again. If you want a cute, sappy, well-acted movie try Christmas in Connecticut or some other classic!"
3,Problems and getting the product.,"The product was fine, but when I ordered it , it did not get here and I had to wait a month to reorder and I thought that was a little long."
2,Bad acting,"The story line was ok, but I thought the acting was horrible. So not rating this movie as great and I would not recommend."
2,Chick Flick,Pure chick flick. You can see the ending coming right from the get-go. No surprises here.
5,My .........,"ALL TIME FAVORITE Cheesy Christmas Movie, even though there are a couple places where the story line did not follow properly what had already been said."
5,The Christmas Card,This is an annual event at our home. My husband and I enjoy this movie every year. I finally ordered the DVD for our library. The value of true love and very clean. I think the way the love is shown in this film is what makes it the good movie it is. Great!
5,Love this movie!,This movie came in plenty of time for Christmas and in great condition as advertised.This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she was thrilled with it. I usually get all our Christmas movie's from Amazon.
5,i love this movie,I watch it every year that it comes on i even get my husband to watch it i love this movie
4,I am satisfied,"Now I can truly review this DVD. It is a pity that it does not have subtitles. Not even for the hearing impaired. And I am seriously hearing impaired. But as I have seen it on TV lately, (with subtitles) I could follow it. But it is still a pity that I did not know what they are saying to each other. If this was the case I would have rated it 5 stars. As for Amazon.com, nothing other than excellent. For you 5 stars.Can someone tell me if there is a version of this DVD with subtitles.? I would like to order this one also. As it had subtitles when I saw it on TV, I assume this must be the case. Or maybe a book?Thank you."
5,Very Romantic Christmas Movie,"Really enjoy this movie, as the young soldier falls in love with a girl he does not know who sends him a Christmas card, he goes to find her on his leave. Ends up she is engaged already. You will have to watch the movie to know what happens. Love o this movie and would recommend to my friends."
3,A TV movie on DVD,"I was disappointed. This is the first TV movie I have purchased on DVD. I expected it to be more contiguous, without the ""hard"" cuts for commercials; new scenes would have a smoother lead-in. Even on an upconvert DVD, it wasn't impressive.It is not a fine addition to our video collection, regrettably."
3,Cute Movie. Predictable. Bad Editing.,"This movie was a cute, cheap chick flick.It had good messages here and there, but it lacked some real ""meat""Really bad editing. The scenes are really choppy, so is the dialouge.I recomend renting it before you buy."
5,I love this Christmas movie,This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. Its one the whole family will enjoy. Its a perfect holiday movie. I have given it as a gift to my kids and they all love it. Its a movie you will watch over and over.
5,"This is not just a ""chick-flick""","I don't think of this movie as just a chick-flick but instead it enables the viewer (whether male or female) to think about the simplicity of what life should be; to follow your heart in both romance and what you really want out of life. Although the movie is portrayed as Christmas time, perhaps it's the season to reflect on one's life and let ""magic"" happen."
5,Really good holiday movie,This was a really good movie to watch during the holidays. I found myself watching it several times.
5,This is one of my favorite Christmas movies!,"This is a great Christmas movie, not too cheesy. The story is wonderful. Definitely a feel good romantic holiday movie."
4,Low-budget but very sweet.,"What the Christmas Card lacks in editing and writing, it makes up for in. . . .adorableness. Is that a word? The scenery is gorgeous and the male lead is handsome. The female lead is just quirky enough to make her original/real to me. The concept is very cool, and even though it is contrived, aren't all ""Christmas movies""? I loved the old-fashioned values and the hokiness! If you are a collector of Christmas romances, you will probably like it. If you are picky, try renting it first."
3,A Christmas Card,"It was a good TV movie, but marred by a couple of poor performances. Additionally the cover photograph shows the lead character as a buck sergeant when the first part of the movie he is a Master Sergeant! A big difference to make such an error on the photograph on the cover. Also the ribbons do not match the characters service in Afghanistan; 5 minutes on the internet could have informed even the most un-informed of the correct ribbons."
5,Another Christmas movie at the very top of my list,This is truly one of my very favorite Christmas movies of all time. You can't go wrong with this one.All of my sisters and my Mother love this one. You will as well.
4,Better Than Expected by far.,"I rented this on a whim without too big of expectations. Was I surprised at how great it was so I am going to purchase one for myself.The story has been told by others., so I will only comment on the film. It didn't have big name actors so had to depend on the story line, acting and views to get across the story. This is a good clean family romantic movie for all but the hardest heart. I had a enjoyable evening with a chocked up throat and a few tears and a very good feeling at the end. When I have had a bad day, I'll pull it out and watch it to boost my moral. Do like I did, rent it first and if you don't want to buy one, I'll be greatly surprised. Too bad there isn't more movies like this one."
5,the chrstmas card,i love the movie and i will continue to buy movies from you and when i fine one i like.
3,For die-hard Diamond fans and/or completists.,"Overall, the album isn't great nor bad, but it has one of my all-time Diamond favorites, ""I'm Alive"" which would fit the soundtrack to the story of my life just fine. I would like to clear up what seems to be a popular misconception, though. The song ""Heartlight"" isn't from the movie ""E. T."" but the lyrics make it obvious that it was inspired by that movie. It was the song that got the most airplay, though ""I'm Alive"" is a much better song to me."
3,Heartlight 1982,"Neil Diamond's ""Heartlight"" is a good album, but not as good as ""The Jazz Singer"" from 1980. There are four good songs on ""Heartlight"" including the title track, ""I'm Alive,"" ""Front Page Story"" and ""Lost Among The Stars."" Neil Diamond has put out great albums, but ""Heartlight"" misses the mark a bit. Not to say, this is a poor album, but if you are looking for songs that sound better or similiar to the title track, a top 10 in 1982, you will be disappointed. But if you are a huge Neil Diamond fan, it is worth getting."
2,The last of the popular Neil Diamond records,"Heartlight, a near front to back collaboration with the legendary 80s' production/songwriting duo of Burt Bacharach & Carole Bayer Sager, would be the last Neil Diamond album to be certified platinum, produce a top 10 hit, and chart in the top 20 for well over a decade; in other words, it's the last sample from his popularity's heyday. By its own merits it hardly deserved the success it provided for the artist, since it's wholeheartedly plagued by unmemorable MOR material glazed in a slick & dated production, though its most cringe-worthy quality is how passionless Neil Diamond and his backing musicians perform the material (not like the songs allow much room for vivid interpretation in the first place). The album did produce ""Heartlight"", an early top 10 hit for Bacharach/Sager in the decade, but while they would move on to write and produce many hits throughout the decade, Neil Diamond drifted from major public attention for the rest of the eighties."
2,Combination Vehicles,"This book combines Combination Vehicles with Doubles and Triples. They are seperate test. The book does not go into the Trailer Hand Valve (trolley valve, johnson bar); Tractor Protection Valve; Trailer Air Supply Control, which are all required reading for the Combination Vehicle test. Beware if you are taking the CDL in the state of Texas the book does not cover Special Requirements for Texas Commercial Motor Vehicles. That is 16 pages of missing information that you need to know."
3,Contents are what you would need for basic survival.,"Backpack is sturdy and contents are what is needed for basic survival.Had some moisture after opening the backpack. I have not determined where moisture was from, could be a minor leak in a water box.There is room to add other items that you may feel are necessary, personnel items, prescription drugs, and clothing."
3,Backpack is epic fail,The contents of the bag were fine and all there. The backpack however broke as soon as I put in on my shoulder. I had to buy one and transfer. Not the end of the world but FYI carrying the stuff is pretty important so you might want to up the quality of the bag.
5,Deluxe 2 person survival kit,This kit comes from a family owned company on the west coast. It is full of goodies that will truly come in handy in the event of an emergency. There were a couple items missing when we first received the kit. Double check that you have everything that is listed on the website. I called the company and they immediately sent out the missing items along with a few other free items to add to our kit. I highly recommend this kit.. .I researched several survival kits in a wide range of prices and this is the best 2-person kit for the money.
2,Recommend Using Another Manufacturer,"Although all the items listed were in the bag--it seemed...well cheaply made. Implied in the word disaster (man made or otherwise) is the idea that conditions will be beyond difficult. Contrary to this implication, the bandages that came with the back-pack wouldn't cover a paper-cut."
4,Survival grab bag,Seems ok . Won't know for sure until I need to use it but it should be enough to get by for a few days. Tools are most certainly short time use . So if you exspect a worse case survival scenerio better up grade the tools or start from scratch and make your own pack .
3,Nice to have kit,"Well put together kit, nice to have items for an emergency. I was a little dissapointed at the low quality of the items. Mainly off-brand cheap items, like the fake ""Swiss Army"" knife, the radio, 5-in-1 survival whistle and even the waterproof matches. I'll probably make another kit myself using products that look like they might be more durable."
4,Fun,"Wooden cigar boxes with a nice residual cigar smell. Some with snap closures, some with sliding lids, and most were of a clam shell design. My batch had a few dings and deep scratches but all worked well and were in good or better condition.Boxes were smaller than I expected so they didn't quite work for my intended purpose but they worked great as gift boxes during the holiday.A good experience overall."
3,Perfect for the asking.,"You get exactly what it says - 10 boxes. There are a very few that are actually wood - which is great for the cost. And they are all good quality as far as cigar boxes go. A couple are actually Really nice. I use these for keeping small collectables and my medications separate from general junk in my desk. They are great. I would suggest straightening the nails in the lids first thing - being careful not to tear up any part of the lid. But they bend out quite easily. The labels are new-ish and are not fake by any means. I figure the person that gathers all of these, boxes them, and then ships them has done a good job. I would love having some specific boxes duplicated - but I know the cost for such a request (although offered with the internal packaging letter) would be too much. Maybe for Xmas next year. But for 10 boxes - it is well worth it."
3,Looks are deceiving,"The picture advertising the cigar boxes were different in size, shape, and color. I thought that is what I was going to receive. To my surprise, all the boxes were exactly the same. Supposedly, the written text explained that fact. I missed the distinction. They are nice boxes, however."
2,DIDN'T DO THE JOB,YOU HAD BETTER BE A REAL EXPERT TO USE THESE ROLLERS BECAUSE I COULD NOT MASTER IT.THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS THAT THE EDGES OF THE ROLLER LEAVE LINE MARKS WERE YOU PAINT AND GETTING ANYTHING LOOKING CONSISTENT IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU NEED TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF PAINT ON THE ROLLER EACH TIME.IF YOU TRY REPEATING THE STROKE OVER THE PATTERN IS GONE AND STARTS TO LOOK SOLID.
2,"Effects work, but not durable","I admit, this Wagner tool was likely abused beyond the limits set by common sense. We used two Wagner's and one Woolie to paint a little more than 1200 sq feet of wall and platforming for a college production of ""Amadeus"". The Wagner roller handles broke on the first day. The Woolie brand is still going strong. We had to manufacture new handles to hold the wire frames in order to continue using the Wagners. The effects are similar, although the Woolie produces smoother results than the Wagner. They both produce a quick undercoat for marbling and general two-color blend that works great for the stage. But my money will go to the Woolie brand next time."
4,Faux Roller,"These faux rollers worked great for our bathroom. Hard to find at regular stores and ordering on-line was easy. I would strongly suggest ordering a stippling brush or another brush to blend the texture into corners and edges though - we used scrunched-up newspaper and shopping bags to get the same effect, but took a lot of extra creativity."
5,Possibly the best Hot Chocolate ever!,"For many years I have been a big fan of Mannheim Steamroller. Years ago, I received their catalog and was surprised to find out they make their own cinnamon hot chocolate. Ever since our first purchase, we never bought any other hot chocolate but theirs. You won't be disappointed and like the old saying, ""Try it, you'll like it!"""
3,Not what I expected,"This product was not as good as I thought it would be. The directions say to use 2 scoops however that was a very weak version of hot chocolate, I found that people were using 3-4 scoops."
3,Shipping cost prohibitive.,The hot chocolate is good yet not really extra special. The shipping cost is almost the same cost as the product. I will continue to purchase good quality hot chocolate locally and thereby avoid the excessive shipping expensive.
4,Hot Chocolate,"Good flavor.Will buy more. Very disappointed on how long it took for delivery by UPS, but understand how mistakes can be made. I have already recommended it to a friend and they have even purchased the product. They enjoy it also."
3,damn spoon,"this stuff is good in coffee, but good luck getting the spoon back in the tin. Chip Davis, we are disappointed... However, the hot chocolate does bring to mind the beauteous interlude from Chakra 6."
5,Delicious,This is the best hot chocolate drink I have ever had. I make it with half milk half water & it is lovely.
2,not good when made with water,when made with water as the directions say it is not very goodbut make it with milk and WOW it's delicious
5,Delicious creamy taste,I used to purchase this cinnamon hot chocolate at Baker's in Omaha and I am delighted to find it again through Amazon. Memories of my daughter's childhood in a cup! Wonderful flavor and creamy taste. Thanks.
4,A Rollicking Rendition of the Traditional Tale,"Here is another delicious version of the classic story of the little Gingerbread Man who leaped from the oven and led a merry chase. Eric Kimmell's snappy, fast-moving text and rhyming, rhythmic taunt draw readers into the story, leading them from scene to scene up to the traditional ending -- which is softened by an additional rhyme, showing a troop of gingerbread people leaping from a fresh cookie sheet. Megan Lloyd brings Kimmell's text to vibrant life, updating the traditional scene: the elderly couple do their baking in a modern country kitchen, and the farm animals pursue the running treat past a modern-style beehive, an abandoned pickup truck, and other ""country style"" debris. This version strikes a happy medium between Galdone's classic rendition and Egielski's more modern twist on the story. It's a rollicking read, suitable for preschool and elementary audiences."
3,Run Run and get this book,tHIS WAS A GREAT GOOD BOOK. I personaly like the part where they eat him. poor guy though. It teaches you not to boast or be big headed about yourself
2,Stones for Tea,"This book has very little culinary value. It is more a travel log with quaint verses and images of British sights and architecture. As such it is not too bad. One shouldn't however hope to gleam any insight into traditional British foods or culinary traditions from this volume, of which there are many in fact that the authors remained unaware of. As post WWII Britain was not the best time to explore British culinary traditions. I dare say that it only takes a half dozen good or bad restaurants to make or break the reputation of an area. So take the Epicurean out of this book's title. Some 20 years after this book was written I spent a few months in and around London. The finest steaks and prime ribs were to be had. Almost every bakery offered delicious savory pastries. The fish and chips, even in small shops, were sumptuous and I have never found Indian and Pakistani restaurants that even compare. And on my meager budget, I had just barely scratched the surface."
1,DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE RAVES ABOUT IT,"Decided to try it after reading ALL of the reviews......I DON:T GET IT Tried it on hot dogs(different brands, types even Kosher), hamburgers, sandwiches as the ONLY condiment & with other condimets to see if it made any difference, on, salads and prettzels.....it was OK BUT NOTHING TO RAVE ABOUT. It will probably go stale before I finish the bottle. Give it a try BUT don't pay more than $5.00 for it like I did....not worth that much."
4,Exactly as it is described.,"I purchased this CD as the shame of not having Vivaldi's Four Seasons in my music collection became too unbearable. Also, i wanted to test out some classical music my new speakers and amplifier.The CD offers a quality recording with only a soft hiss in the background (barely perceivable). Overall, the recording captures the space and imaging of the performance quite well.The synopsis on the CD cover really says it all: ""Critically acclaimed recording of the basic repertoire."""
4,great tv disaster movie,"This dvd is Korean made. The picture quality and sound are terrific. The American version is double sided, but this one is not. Much better single sided. And it is the complete mini series, even though it says it is 96 mins. It has subtitles when it starts, but are easily removed. great movie!"
2,Feed back,"Seen this movie before & had it on VHS. However this DVD has sub titles in Korean & I cannot delete them no matter what I did,added to the fact it freezes up & picture quality tends to be 'grainy' or 'snowy'. I thort it was my DVD player at fault & I tried several DVD's & all worked perfectly,late tried my friends DVD player & the same fault. Other tha that all seems ok & I'll perservere with the faults this DVD. I'm also after 3 other DVD's Fortress & Fortress 2 & Medusa's Child but am thinking twice about buying from a non Amazon store.Other than that this is a good movie with a great story line."
4,Wonderful,"I grew up not really appreciating classical music...and now in my early twenties I figured ""hell, I should try out a new road"". I found this cd...because I used to have a midi track of canon that came with my old computer and I remember listening to it in the 7th grade. I found the version on here to be more moving then any of the other adaptations on any other disc. I find this record to be like a neil young record. Very bare. I know some might say that these peices in their raw form were much more bare...considering they were written with less or any strings. Or some would think that it's crazy talk to compare neil young with anything ""classical""...but I don't think so.Buy this strictly for canon...the other peices are strong as well...but I think there's probably other composers that do the bach and vivaldi better. The handel is also most enjoyable.BUY!!!!"
4,"Truth, Celebrity, and The American Way!","What a great book for a young girl (or even a boy!)! This book provides the esential background information on America's newest hero, Kelly of American Idol! I got a lot out of it (altough I think it is intended for younger people!). It is a great lesson in democracy! Anyone can become famous in this country through the power of democracy! (...)Altogether a great book for a young girl to use as a roadmap to success (...)! My only complaint is that it was a little long! My eyes were getting tired by page 12! I guess fame has its price! Great book! Great Girl!"
5,Excellent.,I found 5 or 6 writers that I was really impressed with in this collection. Such a diverse collection of writing styles. I would not be intimidated by the pure mass of the book and small type- some awesome page-turning stories inside. Definitely a good one if you've burned out your favorite series recently.
2,A Sad SF Renaissance,"Throughout my read, my head kept shaking with disappointment. If the ""renaissance"" of hard SF relies on stories a full decade, even two decades, old, then the genre's future is feebly fixated on its past. Not to say that some of the stories here aren't wonderful ... emphasis on ""some."" But dredging dead decades to claim a rebirth of hard SF fails to deliver on the title's promise. This is more nostalgia than renewal, and you should read a library-borrowed copy if you want to reminisce about great writers past/passing. But don't drop any real money expecting a glimpse into Sci-Fi's future."
5,Great mix of loud & quiet!,"My 2 year old loves this video at night before bedtime. There's a nice mix of loud activities and quiet activities, as well as the usual great pretending lessons Sesame Street promotes."
5,Awesome!!!,I can't say enough good about the play with me series. I wish every episode was availble. Highly recommend all of them
4,like it,I keep forgetting pure cocoa butter is hard and I have to kind of melt it in order to use it but it's a good product. makes my skin better
1,Cocoa Butter Light Choc,"I expected this item to be a soft body type butter that you can use. Instead, it is hard and if you want to use it, you must melt/soften it every time."
4,Great product!!! Happy customer!!,"I have not personally used the headphones, but my fiancee does. I bought them so he could watch tv in bed while I slept. The headphones were really easy to set up and the stand then charge on looks nice. Nothing looks bulky or unattractive. The sound quality is good, from what my finacee says and I can't hear his shows!! Love them!"
5,Great headphones,These headphones work very well. Good sound. Easy to set on the recharging cradle. I can walk throughout my house and hear clearly almost everywhere.
3,Great head phones... Unless you only have digital outs...,"My new LG TV does not have analog outs... Only digital...Might want to check that before you buy the headphones... the adapter to convert digital audio to analog cost $35...The sound good, great battery life... Works with my xbox (You have to change the audio out on the xbox from 5.1 to stereo or something like that)"
4,ALMOST GREAT,"I use to own a recording studio back in the 90s so i had great and not so great headphones. These headphone sound good, for the money. Downfalls are, You have to dial in the radio frequencies. Not hard to do but there is an area that is stereo and not stereo. If there is no signal (music,speach) for a minute or so, the headphone base will turn off and the headphones will play static as loud as you were listening to music. Good things . Not alot of money,sound good, I like the way it is set up for charging the headphones. You just hang them on the base,done. The radioshack pair you have to plug it into a cable. Bass response is bumped high end good but could have alittle more clarity. all around, good buy."
4,"Good Quality, Fair Price","These cans have excellent sound quality, especially for the refurbished price. I own 3 pairs of RS-120s, attached to two t.v.s and 1 to a computer system. There have been changes from the original RS-120s, the earpieces no longer cup, it is missing the ""wide"" circuitry and the frequency tuner is manual rather than the original push button seek. However, the sound quality is quite good. An annoyance is the tendency to produce a loud hiss about 30 seconds after the source stops. The product arrived quickly, I charged the battery for 24 hours and have had no issues since the purchase. It is nice to mill about the house and listen to internet radio, etc."
4,Headphones,"Good headphones for watching TV. Easy to use, I just plugged it into my headphone jack on my tuner, which is connected to my TV. The only problem I have is that the headphones are lose and can fall off if and when I bend over to pick something up...."
3,Good but not so good,"The headphones work well although some times there are some clicks or blips while you are listening especially if the sound is low. However the worst part for me is the following. I use these while I am animating and as long as there is an audio signal playing they are fine. If while I am working there is no audio going on for a few seconds the headphones default into a loud hiss. So I have to turn them off. Then, when I am working on a sound part again I have to remember to turn them back on. Once I've finished I have to turn them off again manually. So this makes it quite cumbersome to use. Likewise when surfing the net and looking at various videos, the headphones are great but if I do not start a new video with sound after a short while they go back into hiss mode. Too bad. I enjoy the wireless feature very much but this behavior is rather annoying."
5,Adjust the Frequencies and It's a Great Set of Headphones,"I ordered these headphones because my husband has a pair and he loves them. So I disregarded the negative feedback about hissing noises. I was using an old pair of Sony's that had to be smacked to work any longer. When the Sennheiser headphones arrived I fully charged them and was surprised that I had a terrible hissing/static noise. I thought they were defective until I went to the Sennheiser site and downloaded the instruction sheet. I found out that there is a lever on the base that adjusts up to three different frequencies. I moved it over a notch and voila! the noise went away. I've suggested to the sellers that they include that sheet with the headphones to avoid confusion about this feature. While there is the faintest hiss in the background, it does not affect the sound. So I am very satisfied with the quality of these headphones and would definitely recommend them to others."
4,A must have,"I use these on a daily bases. My parents usually go to bed before I do, therefor the 55in LED TV with 7.2 surround sound in the living room is also asleep. Not anymore! I've owned these for a year now and have use them to primarily watch movies and play video games in the latter hours of the night without disturbing my family. They are crisp and clear with a fidelity like no other wireless headphones on the market. Now they aren't perfect. They lack some low end and can also become uncomfortable if not seated on your head correctly. Other than that they are great! I highly recommend this product!"
4,Sennheiser RS-120 WirelessHeadphones.,"Love the wireless head phones.Great sound, really great on distance of hearing. ONE problem, the ear muffs hurt my ear's after wearing for a short period of time.If you wear glasses you migt want to have something that cover's less than the whole ear. Other wise ,yeah I do love em."
5,Couldn't be any happier,This is a great set of headphones which I can highly recommend to anybody. We're using them to watch TV.
5,Works great,These did exactly what I needed them to do. My husband wears hearing aids and had to turn the tv so load my son and I did not enjoy watching tv with him. My husband said surround sound quality is better than tv speakers. My mother in law was visiting and after using them she had me order her some too. I do wish they had better directions and packaging. Had problem getting them to work thru the tv but after reading another reviewer had said they plugged them directly into satellite tried it and they worked just fine. Overall we are very happy with this product and the price is great too.
3,Great sound!,"OK, on the plus side, the unit has great sound quality and great range, I can mow my lawn and get good reception with these. On the negative side, this headset is very bulky and not well balanced so if you plan to waer these while exercising it is probably not a good fit."
5,Great product.,I really like this unit. Now I can watch TV without disturbing others. Just be careful not to drop it as it breaks easily. I made the mistake of using the bathroom with it on my head and it dropped on the tile floor.
3,Static at times,Nice headphones but I do get static. Range not quite as advertised. They also slip off the head easily. Still a good buy
3,Headphone,It's a bit large and sometimes a lot of stattic noise. Works for what I need it for but I wish it was smaller.
3,Sennheiser Remanufactured RS-120 Wireless Headphones,Good sound-Settings (volume and tone) very sensitive to the touch when adjusting while in use. Overall I'm pleased that they always work as expected
3,Is it me or the headphones?,"Took me a minute to figure where the battery went, but found it. Once connected, it turns out that I can have one ear surround sound at a time. When the two speakers work together, they are so quiet, I am very aware of any external noise going on. I don't know if this is how they come or if I got a bad pair."
1,Overheard Cordless Phone,"Returned product because of persistent buzzing electrical noise when turning my head or moving hand up to earpiece (on all 3 channels and tunings); probably related to the fact that I could OVERHEAR MY NEIGHBOR'S CORDLESS PHONE in them. My guess is everything from my computer sound card could be heard on the cordless too, given the right channel/tuning conditions. I expect the design flaw isn't limited to this brand/model but for all wireless headphones. But since the drawback wasn't mentioned in the product description, here it is in a review.For what it's worth, the sound quality when not buzzing was very good, and they were comfortable ..."
2,works well but is difficult to store charging on the stand.,"The headset works well for listening,the audio is good but it is easy to detune by accident. You have to retune it many times when you take it off the stand. When you store it for charging on the stand, many times the headphones have to be physically adjusted so that it will reliably charge on the stand."
3,Could be better.,"Great sound quality, won't stay on my head if I move around or lean over which is a real irritation.They don't interfere with my (behind the ear) hearing aids like my old ones from Radio Shack did.I like the charging cradle, it is very easy to get the headphones lined up on it so that they charge.I had some difficulty to get them to recognize the output from my TV. I finally connected them to my laptop (which has an adjustable volume output) and they recognized that at once, then I was able to move them back to the TV and they worked OK.Occasionally caused the VCR to go blank until I moved the transmitter to the other side of the TV.Now if I could just figure out how to keep them from falling off they would be perfect!"
1,rwh,"I own three of the headsets and two chargers. The sound quality is great but after using them about 100 hours, the left side has stopped working on two of the headsets."
3,Must have thought he was being paid by the word,Very interesting book but he tends to write fifteen words when 4-5 could do the work as well. It got to be tedious reading.
1,Painful,"I've tried, I've made it to 100 pages, I can't take anymore. This book is so tediously weighed down, has no flow, goes nowhere slowly. I had high hopes this would be an interesting history, but I give up. Only try this one when you have lots of time and plenty of coffee."
1,This book actually contains the following sentence:,"""Mueller, of all his team best at directing a pitched ball into the gaps afield, did so now...""If you enjoy pretentious, overwritten prose such as that, you'll probably love this book. Because the entire book is written that way."
4,Many books in one,"Thumbing through Echoing at Borders, I bought it expecting nostalgia. It delivered that and more. To me, the book was also a social history of our changing times. To wit: on page 247, Prager reports thatafter the home run, Thompson went on the Perry Como show, then took a cab to the Staten Island Ferry. It is hard to imagine one of today's players using public transportation on a night like that.As others have reported, the book is a bit difficult to read in spots."
3,Great if you love baseball,"I have to read this book for school, so take that into consideration for my review. The author put a lot of detail into this book. For someone not familiar with the sport, it was too much detail which bogged the book down and made it a slow read. If you love baseball and statistics, then you will probably like this book."
3,you could look it up,"when i read a baseball book,i don't expect to sit with a dictionary next to me.there were at least a dozen words that i had to look up,words i never even knew existed.after the first dozen i gave up finding out definitions or i would be still reading.i found most of the book too tedious,after a while it became ""blah,blah,blah"".overall disappointing."
4,Great book...excellent historical review of the grand ole game,I am captivated by the every description of each character of Prager's account of the shot heard 'round the world. It's like I'm growing up knowing these people as their story is woven into one swing of a bat and how it affects the pennant race.This author understands what it means to develop a story. Very high on my entertainment list.
1,Overpriced,"Wouldn't recommend this. Most of the packs will be the cheap dime a dozen pro set, score, etc, from 1990 and 1991. These sets, in any form, are just not valuable. You can find boxes of unopened cards for these sets and better ones for a couple of dollars from card dealers at your local flea market, or card show.It is definitely fun to go back and open these old packs, but I would suggest spending the time to shop around first."
1,Very Disappointing Assortment,"This item shipped to me in a timely manner and there were (30) wax packs just as advertised. The huge problem that I have, is with the content. The seller clearly states, ""cards from the 80's and 90's."" In fact there were NO packs (zero) from the 80's at all! Twenty-nine packs were from 1990, 1991, & 1992. There was one pack from 1994. It is as if the seller took no care or time to have a even distributement of different years. I have collected, sold, and bought sports cards of all types for years and never have I been more disappointed! This is false advertising and if you are looking for something like what the seller states, believe me you want to stay away from this! Incredibly disappointing!"
2,Disappointed!!!!!,Was very disappointed I did NOT recieve any autograph packs are mostly 90-95 not a single eighties pack at all! It was however here basically the next day packaged very well> I guess the discription fits the sellar has up just the years are a little off and you wont get any rookies from those years of the guys the sellar names!!! overall kinda stinky honestly autograph says will be there not anywhere I found.Again the sellar did discribe it very close just a few things in the wording that might make you jump on it that didnt happen for me!!!! some of the packs that are in foil wrapper look great the ones in wax packs look like the could have been resealed my advice tread lightly here!!! sorry I m never to complain normally just wanna give others a fair description of what they would recieve!!!!
1,couldnt get it started,I installed this game and theres no desktop shortcut and I couldnt even get the game running. Mackenzie has never even played the game so dont listen to him.
5,Should I buy?,im really into horse racing and i found this game.but i dont know if i should buy it.tell me if i should or if its just a waste of money.
4,Looks Fun,"Hey...this game looks fun! I mean, if your into racing and all. I am, believe you me!! I read the racing pages in the Boston Herald!! And I'm only 11!! I have Final Stretch - Horse racing Sim, and Gallop Racer 2003!! Like I said...This game looks really fun!!"
3,Bag pet carrier,"Is OK but the materials are not that good, the get danaged ralty fast with the cats claws."
5,convenient and pet friendly,"I appreciate the mesh ""windows"" and the nice padded flooring in this carrier. My kitten only had to be in it briefly for car rides and vet visits but was content enough to purr. I also like the fact that this folds down for easy storage in a closet for later use."
2,Bought for my boss,"I bought this for an old boss. Shipping left much to be desired. I had to glue a few things to keep them on, but it looked cool and the price was unbeatable. Boss is gone, probably wont buy another."
4,Unique gift for lighthouse buffs,"Bought this as a gift for my wife, it was well received. Detail is good, some of the parts came off in shipping, nothing a little glue can't fix."
1,The item came damaged very damaged!!,"I saw the box was not in good shape so when I open the item was not suprised to find it in pieces, I am not sure why if I noticed the box messed up that someone before they shipped it would have not checked the inside to see if the item was OK."
2,Lighouse Birdhouse,"This is the second time i have ordered this birdhouse and it is the second time i recieved it broken. I will fix this one myself, the first time there was no help for it and i had to return it. I do not believe the item was damaged during shipping I just think they are not well made and it fell appart. I will sturdy it up and see how it holds up. It is very cute and I hope it can last outside for a little while. I will think twice about ordering from this company again due to the quality of the item."
2,broken upon arrival twice,"It looks real cute in the photo and I have ordered it twice and both times it arrived broken. The worst thing about it is I don't think it was damaged during shipment. It appears, based upon the packaging, it was shipped already broke."
2,Ugh. Please pass this game up!,"This is the worst Garfield game I have played. You have to collect mice because they have stolen Pooky, but the mice don't put up any fight at all. You collect one mouse, take it to the cage, get another mouse, take it to the cage. It's the same thing throughout the whole game, but they switch it up so you have to take Odie to a hole and have him dig. The game play is exactly the same though. Very annoying, very repetitive. If you want a good game for the DS, Garfield's Nightmare is good. A good game on the Game Boy Advance is Garfield and His Nine Lives. This game should be passed up because it really is HORRIBLE. Even after I read the reviews, I still purchased it from Game Stop and thankfully I bought it used and I took it back and got my money back. The negative reviews are right! Bad!"
1,"Like the pie to Garfield's face, this game is KERSPLAT!","I am a HUGE fan of Garfield. I have read EVERY single comic strip of Garfield, since day 1 it has been out. I recieve emails on Garfield comics everyday, since it updates everyday with one comic strip. When I saw this game, I thought this would be the cutest game, and perhaps fun. My boyfriend and I tried it out, and we thought it was the DULLEST game out there. It was no fun at all. All you do is collect things and put into cages and make sure you eat things. The jumps he does are HORRIBLE. It is either over-simplistic, or just plain lame. I was obviously very disappointed in this game, coming as one big fan of Garfield's. I immediately sold it back to EB games.. I didn't even want to wait for ebay bids--I wanted it off my hands ASAP. This game? DON'T BUY IT!"
5,Broadway's most adult musical in a superb recording.,This is for me the pinnacle of achievement in the life of the Broadway musical. It is the best of all that came before it and nothing has even approached it since its debut. A thoroughly adult look at love and maturity with an extraordinary musical score and exceptional performances superbly recorded. Winner of five Tonys including Best Musical. A must for all lovers of the musical play.
5,Best Musical - 1982,"The surprise winner of 1982's Best Musical Tony (beating the equally deserving ""Dreamgirls) was ""Nine"", an intelligent production, with a beautiful score by Maury Yeston.While arguments can be made about whether this original or the 2003 revival are better, I slightly prefer the revival, only because the orchestrations sound richer. The casts of both are terrific!Best tracks include:My Husband Makes MoviesA Call From The VaticanOnly With YouFolies BergeresThe Bells Of St. SebastianUnusual WaySimpleBe On Your OwnI Can't Make This MovieBoth versions are worthy purchases, but if you have to pick one, pick the revival (single disc, synopsis, lyrics)."
4,A Synopsis Would Have Been Nice!,"For those of us unfamiliar with the plot of Nine, listening to this CD is somewhat confusing. The music is wonderful. Its some of the best music I've ever heard from a musical. My favorites are Folies Bergeres, The Bells Of St. Sebastian, and Be On Your Own. But like I said before, I have no idea who some of these characters are and why they are doing what they are doing. I would have loved to see song lyrics or a synopsis of the plot. Other than the lack of a synopsis I love Nine."
4,The show is very Italain,"I own this orignal recording and the stand out performers are Anita Morris- her Call From The Vatican is vocally amazing and her costume is very sexy. The orchestrations for the show are beautiful. I also have the 1992 London concert cast with Jonathan Pyrce, Ann Crumb, Elaine Paige, Lillane Montevecchi- tony award winner from the orginal cast and Becky Norman. This concert version is a more complete version of the show that the original. Jonathan Pryce, Elaine Paige and Ann Crumb are stronger performers and the chorus is larger and adds men to the chorus. I recommend both cast albums. They should add the 1992 concert cast album to their buying list."
3,Ambivalent,"I found this book to be overkill for the Chicago Ph.D. courses other than econometrics. Proofs are emphasized to the point of neglecting examples, and are not terribly lucid. The book would seem difficult to read anyhow other than as a reference on the rare occasion where you need a very rigorous definition of a given mathematical process (this is how I have used it). Good to have on the shelf since it is the standard bearer in the field, but Simon and Blume will give you everything you need if you are looking to prepare broadly. The few omitted items in constrained optimization will be taught to you in the course of your studies anyhow!"
3,"Too many typos, complete lack of illustrative examples","If you want an exhaustive compendium of definitions, theorems, and their proofs for mathematical economomics, then this book may be extremely useful to you. However, if you're a first-year graduate student in economics who needs some help learning the required mathematics, you'll want a text that has example problems, and this doesn't.And my professor (at UC-Berkeley) kept pointing out typos or errors in the text. Perhaps they'll be corrected in future editions, but for now, be careful!"
2,Overkill,"If you have not studied mathematics extensively, at least an undergraduate major, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It is dense, abstract, has very few concrete examples, and has quite a few errors to boot. De La Fuente is a mathematician in full glory, and the student of economics is often left wondering when he will get to the relevence to economics.To be fair the book does cover most topics at a higher level of sophistication than most other mathematical economics textbooks. It does a nice job covering calculus and the implicit function theorem, if you have seen these topics before. However, unless you have had about 8 semesters of college level mathematics of more, you will not be able to read and comprehend this book on your own without a class.Most of my colleagues at UC Berekeley have been unhappy with this book. If you must use this book for a course, try buying another book as supplement. I recommend Mathematics for Economists by Simon and Blume."
2,Not for first year grad students,"I purchased this book because it was on the suggested list for my economics PhD program. This book was too difficult for most of us. It claims to be arranged in a more intuitive way than the typical math econ book but most of us graduate students found this book indecipherable. There are books that are much more approachable for students at that level. After a few attempts to use it, I never opened the book again. The good thing I have to say about this book is that it held its value and I was able to resell it on Amazon for a decent price."
1,The Worst of Three Math Econ Books,"I bought this book for my Ph.D.-level mathematical economics course, and although I'd gotten an A+ both in Calc I and the honors section of Calc II the year before, I could make neither head nor tails out of the book. Sure, de la Fuente might work alright if you already think fluently in mathematics, but even if you do, you'll probably find Simon and Blume's book superior. If you don't think fluently in math, I'd suggest Alpha C. Chiang's math econ text instead. If you're just trying to learn mathematical economics, don't even open de le Fuente or you might find yourself unnecessarily abandoning the study of economics."
1,Cheap and nothing like picture,"I was searching last christmas for an upside down wall mounted christmas tree. Saw this and purchased it because it was on sale. When I got it, it didn't look even 1/4 as full as what you see on the picture. It's one of those cheap trees. Not worth it at all. Sent it back. You get what you pay for, so if you're not expecting a lush full tree, this would work for you."
3,"Idea is great, but format is choppy","I wanted a siddur that would help me to understand the prayers better. Transliteration is on the left side, Hebrew text is on the right, and english is on the bottom. If you are only using the transliteration, it is fine. But if you want to use the English or transliteration to help read or understand a certain phrase in Hebrew, than this book is not useful. A better book to understand the Hebrew is Artscroll's Interlinear Siddur, but it is not transliterated. I hope that Artscroll makes a second edition of the transliterated siddur in the interlinear format."
4,"Fine Siddur, as far as it goes...","The Art Scroll Siddur is quite fine, but the new transliterated version is limited: It transliterates the Hebrew according to Ashkenazic pronunciation rather than the ""American Sephardic"" pronunciation that is popular in most American synagogues, and it interleaves the transliterations with the regular text in an inconvenient way that makes for choppy reading. Readers may want to consider ""Siddur Ba-Eir Hei-Teiv --- The Transliterated Siddur"" published on-line..."
3,"Ashkenaz, oy vey!","In a rush to buy a transliterated siddur for a friend, I didn't realize that, of course, the transliterations are all in Ashkenazic pronunciation, with ""s"" used for every Hebrew ""tav"" and vowels transliterated into their old Yiddish equivalents. The siddur is useless, therefore, for any Reform or Conservative Jews, as well as for Orthodox Jews who use Israeli pronunciation or Sephardic pronunciation."
4,Helpful for learning Hebrew,My daughter and I study from this siddur on Shabbat to reinforce our Hebrew while Hebrew School is out for the summer. It's helpful for checking pronounciation (if you can translate from Ashkenazic to Sephardic)
3,A bit disappointing,The flower/leaf part is very loose on mine so when my daughter held it and grabbed for the flower it rotated away from her hand. I ended up stitching it tighter to solve this problem. It will also be a problem to clean as you have to unpick the flower material piece from the wooden ring to put into the wash. I don;t think the wooden ring would hold up well to be washed in a machine. As babies drool a lot and like to chew thing I feel being able to wash them is essential. I wish I had looked at this more carefully before buying as I now think it was a waste of good money. Perhaps it could be redesigned with the material piece being held on with velcro. This way it could be easily removed for washing.
4,Pretty!,"Nice quality, very cute little toy! My daughter loves wood & fabric, so I was excited to find this. It doesn't hold her interest for as long as I'd hoped, but it does get weekly lovin'"
5,Pushing Back the Perameters,"I have just read a number of rave reviews for Baseball Before We Knew It, so I won't try to outdo them. But I am a member of SABR and interested in tracing the development of 19th century uniforms and caps. I had email contact with Mr. Block before he finished his book, so my anticipation was high, and now I can say my expectations were more than met. From a practical and special point of view, I can now hang my ""uniforms"" on Block's chronological reconstruction, knowing that not every issue is settled, but that wide new vistas have been opened for my own research. His chronological flow chart toward the back is most helpful for the historian. Now we need to watch a good documentary movie on the Discovery Channel, so we can ""see"" what a game of ball looked in the Middle Ages. Would Kevin Kostner be interested?Great job, David Block!Jim ""Batman"" Battenfield of California"
5,An in-depth study of baseball and its historical roots,"Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search For The Roots Of The Game by baseball historian and expert David Block is a well researched, expertly written, inherently interesting, reader engaging, in-depth study of baseball and its historical roots. Baseball's actual origin is in Europe and Baseball Before We Knew It resents a wry and informative authorship of Block's intricate study of the great 'American' sport. Baseball Before We Knew It is very highly recommended reading for baseball fans and students sports history for its invaluable documentation and seminal, groundbreaking collection of information compiled and comprised to create what may easily be seen as the ultimate book of baseball. No personal, academic or community library Sports History collection can be considered complete or comprehensive without the inclusion of David Block's Baseball Before We Knew It!"
2,Old News,"Far from containing any ground-breaking revelations, this book is essentially old news. Except for a few details that Block has added, virtually everything in it can be found in Harold Peterson's ""The Man Who Invented Baseball,"" which was published in 1973."
1,Jet Boating,"This video is a total waste of time if you're looking for a video about jet boating in northwestern United States. If you're familiar with Duckworth, Custom Weld, Jetcraft, etc., forget this video. This video's idea of a jet boat is a large Ski-doo, believe it or not they are even made of fiberglass. Never are they on a river. You get my point. One star is overrated."
2,"Despite the name and description, not really made in the USA","I just bought one of these, same make and model number at a local store and the end of the box says ""TESTED IN USA"" and ""Made in China"" in tiny letters under that. You can tell by using it that it's not great quality."
3,Frame Too Large,The glasses are very attractive but the width of the frames makes it impossible for a woman with an average head size to wear. They slip off very easily even after adjusting the nose piece. They would be better for a man's head.
1,Buy a RB Aviator 62mm RB3026 but get a 58mm as RB3025,"I needed to send it back to Amazon, because when I opened the box I realize that the sunglasses isn't the correct model. I bought a 62mm aviator but they sent me a 58mm. The type marked on the box is 62mm, but I can see the label on leg is RB3025. I feel unhappy and can you send me a real 62mm aviator RB3026 as soon as possible?"
3,too long in the ears,They're too big on the ears and they keep falling down.I have to watch out my moves when wear them 'cos I'm afraid they fall on the floor.Would be nice if they were smaller and shorter.
2,not very good&#12290;the frame has some problem,not very good&#65281;the frame has some problem&#12290;i fixed it in store&#65281;but&#65292;glasses is ture rayban&#12290;price is also ok&#12290;i will give only 2 star
3,2012 Model,"I bought from this seller last June for my first pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses. I absolutely loved them! Strong frame, glass lens, G-15 was an amazing lens option, and they looked great. HOWEVER, my brother broke them, so now I ordered another pair.The 2012 Model of the RB3026 features a NOTICEABLY wider nose bridge. This makes the glasses seem much bigger on my face compared to my old Ray-Ban aviators. The bridge of the frame also came slightly bent.(Didn't happen last time.)Ray-Ban has always been a trusted company for many years, as my dad owned aviator's for 30 years off one pair. But in this new 2012 model, it's very obvious that they have lowered their standards.All in all, these glasses are still made of the same strong metal frame, and the lenses are just as beautiful, but the fact that they changed the design, making them way wider then they need to be, and that my pair came slightly bent, is very disappointing. 3/5."
1,Buy a RB Aviator 62mm and get a 58mm!,"Needed to send it back to Amazon, because when a opened the box realize that the sunglass isn't the correct model. I bought a 62mm aviator and they sent me a 58mm. Awful business!"
4,"If only we had the "" four-and-a-half star option"".","Sure beats the heck out of my old 9.6 volt makita. This drill is excellent, I would like to say that it's much closer to deserving a five star rating than a four so let's give it four and 1/2.... If balance is a must, this drill has it, even with the extra pound I added with the quick exchange bit, and drill and drive system I use. User fatigue doesn't seem to be an issue. The only thing I noticed that may take some getting use to is the 3 speed clutch. At times the drill doesn't seem to want to advance out of a gear so it's necessary to run the drill, allow the motor to stop and try again. Not a big issue and if it's the only one I can't complain!! Do yourself a favor and look closely at the 14.4 volt Porter cable. If you dont mind the extra 20$ on the price tag it may be the only comparable drill on the market."
3,still delivers,I've had this reconditioned cordless drill for years now. The drill smokes and stinks when under heavy usage but it keeps on keepin on. Hasn't died yet.
5,A great book for little dinosaur lovers,"I have read a lot of books about dinosaurs to my son...but this is one of the best I have run across. The information is presented very well. The book lists the dinosaurs according to the time period in which they evolved. It also has information on climate, diet, special characteristics of each dinosaur, and little scenarios depicting dinosaur life. My son especially liked the comparative studies between different species. The pictures are fantastic. It is detailed enough to answer most questions a child would ask..yet not too complicated. If your child is too young to read well...then be prepared to read aloud till you are hoarse! The only negative that we saw.. it does not describe every dinosaur ever discovered!"
5,Excellent must have book. For the shelf above your monitor.,"I was looking for pure reference. This is it. It will tell you essentially everything you need to know about ADO. I used it on NT with ADO 2.1 on MS Access 97 database. This helped tremendously.Remember those old Borland books where they tell you which C functions work on which operating systems? This book takes the same approach. Even though it says ADO 2.6, it distinguishes what works on NT, vs Win2000. Also helps you with database differences, Oracle vs SQL Server vs MSAccess.You'll wear out the binding like I did, I guarantee it. Happy programming!"
1,"Big book, little useful advanced content","Once again, I am awed by the fact that a publisher can continually put out books with untested code samples. I am an advanced database programmer and I found this book of little use to me. RDS was simply glazed over with the properties, events and methods supplied, but no concrete explanations of how to use it in an Internet environment. For a beginner or intermediate user, this book may supply a good foundation, but when trying to figure out why the code samples don't work or why there are inconsistencies in the syntax of the samples, this book will leave you hanging. May as well just fight it out with MSDN..."
4,"Very fine, but ...","This is a wonderful recording. But alas, it lost its luster when I heard the Philips CD featuring Arthur Grumiaux (Philips 420700). I would encourage lovers of this music to give a listen to Grumiaux. I found his interpretations to have the best rhythmic, melodic and musical sensibilities of any that I've heard. Technique is invisible; it's the music that comes through with transparent clarity, strength and sensitivity. And the Philips transfers are outstanding. IMHO, Grumiaux, Standage and Perlman, are the order in which I would recommend of these wonderful works."
3,"Great composition, but recording quality is bad","I love the music of this CD but the quality of the recording is bad. For one, I cannot play this CD in my car because it makes a lot of ""scratchy"" sounds. I admit, this might be something with my player, but I have no other CD's that reproduce this behavior. Another thing that irritated me is that because this recording is live, you can hear lots of coughing at various times throughout. I am now on a quest for another recording."
4,"Ah, Bach","This recording should be your first choice, it is full of life and authority. I personally believe it sets the standard. -> I was let down after listening to the Philips recording of Arthur Grumiaux. His interpretation is sometimes rushed, sometimes late, sometimes too meek."
3,"ehhh, i've heard better","Well let's make this short and simple.This album is okay as it's own seperate entity. However, when compared to Rodeo&Picasso; or their little ep, it kind of sucks. This cd is so much different from what they used to be. If this were their only piece of work it would probably be fairly decent, but it's such a change from their older stuff it's kind of jarring. There's also some kind of weird 3 minute or so pre-gap between song 10 and 11, i don't know why, but it annoys the hell out of me."
5,The Best from The Boss,"This is the absolute best Bruce Springsteen album...bar none!If you've never heard it...buy it now...sit back, relax and let it take over, you'll love it!Peace :o)"
4,Acoustic Bruce,"I can't listen to Springsteen very often or very long. His songs are too emotional and intense and after two or three of them, I push eject and go on to something a little more relaxing. The sound of Nebraska, by comparison with most of his stuff, is mellow -- although the content of the songs is depressing. With the exception of ""Atlantic City"" none of the tunes are great, but all in all it's a listenable CD of moderately good, frequently violent, mostly sad folk songs."
5,beyond description,"Springsteen's ""Nebraska"" was one of his least successful albums commercially, to date having sold, I believe, fewer than a million copies.Among his fans, however, this CD is regarded with a kind of reverent awe: it is unquestionably Springsteen's best work, exploring dark, introspective themes that he had never visited before, and has not since.It's just unbelievable. I'm not really such a big fan of ""The Boss,"" either. But this CD has a coherence, grace, and power that defy description.The lyrics will have you slitting your wrists, though."
5,Need to listen to on vinyl,"This is the kind of album that could never make the modernizedleap to a CD. Selections from the album, along with severalfrom the Ghost of Tom Joad, show the quiet, acoustical, hymnfor the under-trodden side of Bruce. An out of the mainstream testament."
4,Calm Before the Storm,"I admire the Boss for having the guts to follow up 1980's smash ""The River"" with this dark, moody acoustic release. He was on the cusp of major stardom and he knew it, but he let his artistic instincts have their way, and the result is this beautiful work of art, recorded at home on a 4-track cassette machine as a demo that the E Street Band couldn't improve on in the studio. After being carried around in Springsteen's back pocket for several weeks, the demo cassette was mastered to disk and that's what we have here. Beyond the recording aspect, the songs are some of Springsteen's best and most evocative (play ""Open All Night"" on your car tape deck while the sun's just coming up and you'll get chills). The calm before the storm (musical and otherwise) of ""Born In The U.S.A.,"" and an artistic triumph."
5,Spingsteen stark and cold,"Sandwiched right into The River and Born in the USA this shows how Springsteen's work covers all areas. He tells you how he feels about growing up and human nature at its worst sometimes. ""But when it's your brother, sometimes you look the other way"" Buy it!!"
4,An OK album,"This album spawned only one hit,ATLANTIC CITY,which would appear on 1995's GREATEST HITS. It's a ballad about the New Jersey town famous for its boardwalk,casinos and nearby hotels. ""Put your makeup on,fix your hair up pretty,and meet me tonight in Atantic City."",are sample lyrics from the song. Unbelievably,this album flopped just after the abundant success of 1980's THE RIVER. But the follow-up BORN IN THE U.S.A.,released in '84,would be an even bigger success than THE RIVER. TUNNEL OF LOVE followed in 1987 and would become a #1 album also."
5,Don't Get Caught on the Wrong Side of That Line,"In my opinion, this is Springsteen's best record. It's a no frills recording, made on a portable Tascam unit, with only acoustic guitar, vocals, and harmonica. This bare bones setting allows the storytelling nature of these songs to shine through. And the stories they tell are hypnotic, hard luck narratives of the American Dream gone wrong. Springsteen's album is full of murderers, criminals, and honest men unable to make a go of it, all with the odds stacked against them. ""Atlantic City"" is probably the best known song from this album and one of its strongest cuts. My favorite has always been the pulsing ""State Trooper"" with its undercurrent of implied violence. ""Please don't stop me,"" the narrator begs, while the ""radio is jammed up with talk show stations"". The album is so rich in detail you can almost see the dusty highways, backwater towns, and gambling dens unfold before you. Nebraska belongs in the pantheon of American Folk music."
5,Obviously inspired a lot of people,"Just listen to this album, then anything by the Nebraska Guitar Militia, and you'll see the connection. Or maybe Springsteen just grokked what it's like to be from Nebraska."
4,Great American Classic,"Bruce has been singing, songwriting and producing music w/ the E street band. He takes a colder, acoustic sense of reality using contrast and sadness. A great travel cd, excellent lyrics!"
3,Nebraska,"I am a huge Bruce Springsteen fan, and have nearly all of his CD's, and I am still a huge fan, but I don't think this CD is one of his best. Don't get me wrong - Springsteen has a knack for telling stories about people who have been through hard times and who have been through the darkest parts of life, and he has a knack for making us feel these characters' pain, but, I think the tone of the music is too low keyed - it's almost as if the music on each track sounds the same.But, still worth listening to."
3,Springsteen's Pizza Tapes ???,"Let me preface by stating that I'm not a hugh Springsteen fan. But based on the high ratings by obviously bigger fans, I got a steal on this CD (Sony/BMS Japan 2005 version) at Half Price Books for $7. Nebraska is clearly not mainstream for a casual fan like me. Sound quality is marginal given that it was recorded on a 4-track cassette recorder. Lyrics are heavy, music is Bruce up close and personal (mostly accoustic). I give a 3-star rating out of professional courtesy until this one has a chance to soak in...I wonder what kind of pizza he ordered."
3,"classic... well, some of the songs.","This CD has a good feel to it. It's a dark, harrowing trip through the shadowy side of America. SOme of the songs are a little boring though. However, it is to be noted song #2 is one of the best songs I've ever heard. It's about gambling and people coming back from the dead. That's two plusses in my book."
1,Boring,"Like every other album he has ever done, Nebraska is boring painful to listen too. His lyrics are predictable and the music has no life."
3,Review of Climatique,"After watching the commericals on television, I was anxious to try this product and experience great sexual gratification. Well the product is okay but not great, It did give me the thrill that I was expecting."
3,Not much action,"This book has a high rated history as a best seller, etc.To me, it seemed to border on the philosophy and management aspects of double-agents, as opposed to how double-agents avoid being exposed and how useful they were to the Allied cause, and so on.Of course the reader can't ignore that it was a best seller, won awards, etc.The word ""System"" in the title maybe explains what the book is all about.Note that the U.S hardly gets a mention. Maybe the U.S. didn't have any double-agents?"
3,Not enough information,Some of the slogans are really easy and some are way too short! I was hoping it would be more like the game Logos but it really wasn't... i really like the cards about the superbowl ads and before they where stars... those cards were very fun!
3,Not as current...,"Thought this would be more of today's catch phrases but instead was more of ""yesterday's"" slogans and catch phrases - not as expected"
4,fun game,fun game for families! bought this to have over Christmas and enjoyed playing it with the family.
1,Poof-Slinky,If I ordered this it must have been well over a year ago. I know that I've never play it with my family or friends.
4,Fun family game,"Simple, fun game for my teens, but adults seem to know more of the answers. Quick-moving and plenty of cards not to repeat too often."
1,Sketchy,"I had to use this book for a college course. The author's ""for instance"" examples are non-relative and quite ridiculous. Her explanations are not concise. Her labs seemed to be geared to high school level education. The steps are over-explained and are so tedious to follow that you don't get anything out of it. I'm now in the process of searching for another Java programming book so that I can learn the nuances of this language that were missed in this book. I feel that the many ""for instance"" examples she uses insults the intellegence. This book is definitely not book that you want to use to learn Java."

1,"Please, do NOT buy this book!","I was forced to buy this book as a college text book. I have been programming using structured programming languages and Visual Basic for a few years, and have recently learned C++ and have a good understanding of OO methodolgy, but this book STILL confuses me. I can do all my assignments for class and get A's on the exams, but when I sit down to read the text, I wonder what language Joyce Farrell is speaking. Beyond that, the book frequently uses terms that it doesn't define (such as ""Friendly"" access...) and rarely shows you the code that you are supposed to be working on. The pages are full of ""Insert these lines into your program..."" and the such, but you NEVER SEE THE PROGRAM! Bottom line, this book is useless as a reference. Don't buy it, please!"
1,This is a beginner's book?,"I don't reccomend this book; I regret my purchase. I am trying to learn java and there are a lot of holes in the text that need to be filled. I expect difficulty in learning a new computer language, but I did not expect difficulty in following the text. The topics jump in leaps and bounds. I find myself in a new section of the book and I don't even know what I read."
2,Someone Please Put The Punk Genre Back In It's Place,"To be perfectly honest I grew up on the likes of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Warren Zevon, and Tom Petty, so basically I'm firmly ensconsed in the Rock camp, but I'm always willing to give other bands a chance.I kinda wish I didn't give this band one.The songs are catchy, certainly, in the same way that 'The Song That Never Ends' is. You will soon wish to drive a stake through your skull. The band members are not bad musicians, but they are solidly average. The singer, well he can hit higher notes than I can, which would be impressive if he didn't sound so much like a prepubescent boy.CIWWAF is clearly attempting to follow in the footsteps of Fall Out Boy or Panic! At The Disco but their stride falls short."
5,songs with a twist,"Especially love the album cover. I like how they bring in a bit of honesty and straight forward. Like on ""Newport Living"" about being fake and selling out..you couldnt even do that right. I love that. Its each one of the songs on here has that lyrical bite to it. But at the same time the songs are fun as anything to listen to and i plan on doing a lot of that now and in the future. I had no idea about this band before i purchased the CD. But with that purchase i know have a better idea of what Cute Is What We Aim For is about musically speaking.Love it the cd and all that as well. Great songs + fun had while making and listening to the cd = a worthwhile purchase in my book."
2,Just ok,"When I first heard this cd, I didn't like it. After a few more listens it grew on me, but it's still a little hard to take in one sitting. The problem is, Cute try to do too many things in too little time. At some points, the sound like New Found Glory. At others, they sound like a toned down version of Panic at the disco. As for the ballads, think paramore meets october fall. It's pretty messy, but it grows on you after a bit. I still think the band does best in NFG mode (examples: Sweat the Battle Before the Battle Sweats You, Sweet talk 101 and There's a Class for This), but thats just a matter of taste. Also, many people have raised the point that the album suffers from too much filler. I agree, with reservations. When a band tries many different styles on an album, some of the songs can sound uneven, or, not as ""good"" as others. Again, this is really a matter of taste. Hopefully the band will expand on the energetic pop-rock sound they fit best with, and deliver a better follow-up."
5,The book and the movie,"I love this book, but I have to admit that I watched the newest 'Peter Pan' movie, starring Jeremy Sumpter, before I actually read the classic. Although the movie including many exact or related lines right from the novel and most of the same major scenes, I found that, in the movie, there was that 'puppy-love glow' between Peter and Wendy that just made the storyline so much more interesting and sweet. The novel does show some sense of that, but not as much as the movie. The whole idea that Peter tries to hide his feelings for Wendy yet act completely irrisistable at the same time...or at the end when Peter and Hook are fighting and Hook makes him realize that he is incomplete and so on. How the movie focuses on 'feelings' in the individual stages of childhood, youth, and adulthood are most interesting and are well demonstrating in the movie. Now, I love this book very much, but I suppose I was a little disappointed when it did not include such things."
5,Very pleased--highly recommend!,I absolutely love this table & chair set. They are very sturdy and constructed well. I purchased the cherry color and am very pleased with it. My daughter uses the table set daily to color and read her books. It's very sleek and it even matches my daughter's bedroom furniture. My item shipped quickly and arrived within 7 business days. I highly recommend this set.
3,table and chairs,The service was excellent. I can't really tell you a lot right now. I purchased this for my 19 month old grandson for Christmas. It is wrapped and under the tree. I'll try to give more updates after Christmas.
3,Not for the non specialist!,"This book may well be everything its poblisher says it is, but it still will be of little use to readers unused to reading mathematical tracts. I was disappointed. With all the contention in this crucial field, somebody needs to go back to the beginning and carefully review the issues -- without bias and animus -- in a way that any attentive reader can understand."
2,"Way off the mark, and Lenny knew it","Bernstein conducted this traditional British-style performance before historical interpretations caught hold. Since he didn't like that style but knew that it was much closer to reality than this dinosaur, he gave up Messiah as far as I know, saving is attention for Haydn's choral works, which he conducted superbly. This reading isn't bloated or draggy, but it's jsut way off the mark."
4,A Worthy Addition to Your Classical Collection,"It's everything it's cracked up to be in the previous interviews. However, DON'T listen to it with headphones, as the inadvertent plucking of strings in the pauses is distracting. Otherwise, wonderful!"
2,Intense,"Normally, I enjoy violin/string music, but this collection was too intense. I couldn't relax and enjoy the sounds for feeling like gritting my teeth or holding my breath!"
2,Oscar Wilde plays Barber?,"Apparently, Thomas R. Brown is the only reviewer who has actually listened to this disc.The performance of the Barber is not only the worst performance of the Adagio that I've ever heard; it's probably the worst performance of any piece by a major orchestra that I've ever heard, live or recorded. The complete lack of synchronization between the various string sections is embarrassing; the sloppy entrances are distracting and graceless. The orchestra sloshes from phrase to phrase like water in a bucket being carried over rough terrain. One wonders whether Bernstein was bothering to conduct at all, or was making everyone guess. This performance would have been unacceptable from my Youth Orchestra 25 years ago.The other tracks are considerably better, but it's hard to make up for such a pathetic effort on the lead track."
2,Harley-Davidson: The Spirit of America,"I was not impressed by this video. There was some good pictures but overall I feel the film does not live up to its advertisement. I have been a H-D owner,rider,enthusiast for over 10 years and ridden many scenic routes and been to several rallies which were far, far superior to anything on this film. Again, Film does not live up to its description!"
5,Motivation for anyone questioning being a Mathematician,"Hardy, in just a few short chapters, crafted a beautiful book that is nothing less than a devotional for mathematicians. Reading one chapter a day for the rest of my life would keep anyone in a state of mathematical bliss. In my own educational journey, Hardy gave me the feul for the fire to persist in my degree program. Every sentence of this short memoir is quotable, and I would recommend this book for anyone considering entering the field of math as well as anyone who feels stale in their choice of becoming a mathematician. In A Mathematician's Apology, Hardy clearly shows that he is the Knute Rockne of math."
2,Partly enjoyable,Hardy explains well how discoveries are made. Snow's description of Hardy's life is unnecessary and a distraction from the focus.
5,This is a book which should be read by all college students,"Hardy was a giant among early 20th century mathematicians. It is difficult to overstate his importance. He was one of the first to show that mathematics is as much art as science without having to have interpretation (such as Dunham's ""Journey Through Genius..."").This is what makes this book so poignant. Hardy realizes that he no longer is Hardy. In today's mathematics world that may not have been the case given the immediate communications possible between humans which may have kept him going. However, it may have been that he was suffering from the onset of dementia or Alzheimer's - it is difficult to tell given his admissions of not being up to the task - regardless, this book is overwhelmingly sad.Anyone who cares about math should read this and thank Hardy for his contributions - plus they should have a copy of ""A Course in Pure Mathematics""."
3,Classic essay; weak publishing,"Hardy's work speaks for itself, but this edition lets it down. Rather pricy for the small number of pages, and full of annoying typos - appears to have been published by scanning/OCRing an earlier edition without anyone bothering to proofread the result. There may well be better editions out there- especially used ones."
2,56 page version is junk,"The 56 page version of this book is not worth your time or money. The first 41 pages are spent largely elaborating on why a mathematical theorem is more important than a chess problem. Maybe I didn't appreciate the math enough, but it just rambled.The only interesting part (to me) were pp 42-52 where he discussed whether mathematics was useful to humanity and touched on philosophical considerations related to math's effect on war.Lastly, it has missing or extra letters on words or is missing words altogether, and sometimes in multiple places on one page. I don't know where the editor was. Buy a different version for sure, or if you still buy this one, consider just skipping to page 42."
3,A True Gentleman And Scholar,"G. H. Hardy was an influential figure in British mathematics in the early 20th Century. C. P. Snow who was his friend in his later years wrote the foreword to this book. This is a short book with the foreword taking up 58 pages and Hardy's contribution about 90 pages. It is a bit pricey, but contains Hardy's own words, which to me do not come across as apologetic as its title might suggest. Hardy has explained his stance about his career as a pure mathematician compared to other professions. He defends his profession and thus himself not against any particular criticism, but in the larger arena of human activities and contributions to knowledge over recorded history. Hardy has portrayed himself in this book as having a firm and proud character. He was also a realist who recognized at the time of writing this book, when he was about sixty-three, that the era of his mathematical creativity was long past."
2,cannonball run europe,"Very disappointing DVD, just a bunch of drunken yobs, (hardly makes me proud to be British!)...the original Cannonball runs were tongue in cheek movies, obviously Hollywood suspend belief/fantasy movies, not this group of morons."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"WAS ENJOYING THE DVD UNTIL I REACHED CHAPER SIX AND 3 SECONDS INTO IT IT QUIT AND JUMPED TO SOME WINTER CANNONBALL OUTAKES, NO SCRATCHES IN DVD, I FEEL ITS A MANUFACTURE DEFECT. NO WORTH TIME TO RETURN FOR ANOTHER"
1,Timely service but bad product,"I bought this jersey for my husband, who is a huge laker fan. Was really disappointed when I open the packaging & saw that most of the numbering & writing were already peeling off the jersey. That was without wearing or washing....straight out of the packaging. Had to return it & scramble to find another jersery in time for the occasion."
5,Hi quality - Half price,This jersey was thick material with sewn on cloth letters and numbers. The jersey was true to size. As good quality as jerseys that are $80 in the stores. I paid approx. $45 for this jersey.
2,Did I Miss Something? Cause I Was Really Disappointed!,"5 DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON is said to be Mario Bava's worst film & I couldn't agree more. It looked like Bava didn't care about this movie at all. Sure, it had style to spare cause it's by Bava, but for the most part, this movie is just plain boring. The only saving graces of this film is the colorful direction, beautiful women, & some sleek & stylish visuals.Unless you're a serious Bava fan, this movie may not be for you."
3,Strange and Groovy,"The maestro Mario Bava may not have liked this rare late sixties romp but it does offer quite a few pleasures: a wonderful pop score, breathtaking color, bizarre and masterly compositions and an all around sense of nonsensical fun.It's not at all a good film in the usual sense but if you're a Euro-cult or Bava fan than it's very likely that you'll find it a pleasure.For horror fans, be warned that their is almost no on-screen horror to be had. It's not that type of film."
3,Unreleased in the USA until now!,"5 DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON is by no means one of Mario Bava's greatest achievements (the title itself is reminiscent of the hit BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS in the US the same year). It is certainly a lesson, however, in doing the best with what you've got. Basically an Italian [version] of TEN LITTLE INDIANS, this film is rather low on substance. The chracters are mostly dull and the plot rather contrived. In other hands this would be cause for concern. Under Bava's stylish and adept direction, DOLLS achieves some ingenious moments and fantastic imagery. The film looks wonderful on DVD, sans some scratches and some weak colors. Can you guess the ending? Well, it might be a no brainer, but at least you get to spend 74 minutes watching the results of a master Italian suspense filmmaker. Recommended for Bava fans (and those who enjoy watching Italian women romping around in Pucci gowns). Viewers are also treated to multiple language and subtitle options."
2,5 Dolls review,"I'm not sure why it has this title, unless it refers to the victims. I guess something got lost in translation."
2,BORING!!!,"I saw this cd on sale at a local record store (...)and being the cheapskate that i was decided to get it cause i love the song 'will you wait for me'. No wonder this cd was so cheap! Boring to the max. i actually fell asleep listening to this crap. i give it 2 stars for that song alone, the rest are all fillers. one of the worst cd i've ever heard. only buy this if you are an insomniac, it'll cure it."
1,Another thinly veiled advertisement for the author's website,"What a disappointment! Almost nothing of real value. Of the many dozens of books on daytrading, and I own most of them, only a handful present useful information that you can actually utilize. Tony Oz, Jea Yu, Joe Dinapoli, Toni Turner and Linda Raschke are your best sources. I intend to either return this waste of paper and ink or sell it. Frankly I would hate to rip someone off so I hope I can return it for a credit. I had high hopes, I even ordered this six weeks before it was published."
4,Part-time traders look here.,"Hey, if you are like me and have a full-time job while you trade, then I think that you will find this book valuable. This is real world stuff from a real trader. I mean, if failure is the best teacher then this guy can has learned alot. In the book, Borsellino talks about how he worked over $4 million down to $100K and what he learned from it. That's the best part about this book, lessons like that broken down into a simple set of rules to trade by. Another plus, Borsellino gives you his support and resistance levels every day on the S&Ps free on TradingMarkets.com!"
3,Beginners Only,"One of the trading legends of this generation , I'd imagine it might have been painful for Lewis to ""talk down"" and write the book in this total trading newbie tone. Experienced traders will find little information here of any use. Just very basic TA, bit of overworked trading principles and the customary psychology chapter. I did find one page discussing fair value and premiums to be interesting and there are a few pages going over the economic indicators at the end of the book that might be worth taking notes on. Overall, a decent pick up for a total beginner though useless for any seasoned trader."
1,Waste of money,"Here we go again, another trader joins the herd of new writers and ""experts""!. The writer spends more time talking about his web site and himself than teaching how to trade !!. I managed to return this book and I got my dollars back. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, PERIOD!"
5,Indispensible resource!,This book brought me up to speed for the current changes in practice and the certification exam.
4,Very Interesting!,"Channeled thoughts and pearls of wisdom about the Reiki origin and purpose, and how Reiki should be practiced according to Wei Chi - one of the founders of Reiki 5 000 years ago. Wei Chi, which is channeled by the authors, are tough and ruthless in his opinions of the practice of Reiki of today. He is a very imposing teacher and personality that you can't help but like. This is a real favourite for me! You can visit the authors homepage at http://www.weboflight.com/."
4,Insightful Information,"This book is on my suggested reading list for my Reiki classes. As a Reiki master-teacher, I have sought out any material that supports more self participation and responsibility of clients in a healing event. It is easy to place the fate of our own health into the hands of a healer, and I find this channeled writing refreshing and full of positive information for healers as well as their clients. Considering that all Reiki masters are ""channels"" of Reiki energy, I am comfortable with channeled materials when they come with the highest of intentions. All I had to do was pick up this book and feel the good energy coming from it to know that the material is authentic."
1,Will the real Wei Chi stand up?,"Reiki is a real healing process. One problem with being an open minded light seeker, is we are afraid to question the absurd. We are too accepting of anything couched in the trendy terms of the day. Yes I saw one of the authors in his robe do live channelling of Wei Chi with revelations as vague as a political candidate. We are to revere this information which ignores the slave existence of Tibetan peasants of that era, who gave all to the Temple. Why would a monk from a hazily identified time choose to visit Emery and Hensel, two unlicensed New Hampshire counselors with buy-by-mail degrees? Tell us fellas, the world awaits your wisdom."
5,Dvorak's Symphony No.8,"I love this symphony!I played this music when I in the high school orchestra.Then,I got a vivid impression of the Dvorak's symphony.Many of its melodies moved me a great deal.The beginning melody of the third movement makes me feel as if I am at a dance party.And the theme melody of the fourth movement is very energic;it makes the movement successful.No matter how many times you listen to it,you will always find some something fascinating."
3,Only Demystified that turns out to be simplified,"I found this animal on the discounted, discounted stack. What a find! Well I dug through it and found nothing, no extraordinary insights. In fact many functions and formulas were over demystified. I suppose this is better than not. I can never hurt to see project management from a different view; however this should not be the only book."
1,Simply a bad product..,The light powering cells are made of bad quality. This thing went straight to the trash. Had to hold it at a certain angle in a room full of light just to barely see numbers.
4,Not what I expected,"I ordered this thinking it was something akin to a director's vocal score with full libretto and all the music. It's most definitely every bit of music from the show, but no libretto.This will make a nice extention to my Broadway Musical lineup. Just wish it had the libretto too so as not to have to go back & forth between the two books."
4,Excellent buy!!!,"I am very satisfied with the product acquired, and the previous description of it is as I received it. And the shipping is great not take long to get my hands on and enjoyI've done an excellent buy"
5,Insightful,"Terry makes some practical suggestions for getting your life on track and moving forward. It's uplifting, positive, and easy to read. He combines age-old wisdom with some fresh new approaches. I'd recommend it to anyone."
4,Nice,This product is well made and will hold it's shape when in use. I use it often and just put it on the top tray in the dishwasher to clean. I haven't had a problem with it.
4,Ateco Stinless Steel Doughnut Cutter,"Product arrived quickly and was reasonably priced. It was a gift, so I have not used it myself but it looked like it would work just fine."
2,Does the job.,"This Doughnut cutter does the job but I think the edges could be sharper. ALSO, this thing will rust on you in a matter of seconds if you keep one tiny drop of liquid in it. Be careful."
2,came dented.,the cutter was good but the donuts are not completely around. would not buy from this seller again. I told them about it they didnt care.
5,Works great,It works how it is supposed to !! Very pleased with it and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for this
3,bent out of shape and flimsy,"I own the smaller ateco cutter and it's much sturdier than this. I opened the box and it's already dented and slightly bend because it's so cheap, like foil, very flimsy. I can't even believe both donut cutters are made by the same company. This is being sent back."
3,A bit flimsy and the dough does stick.,"While this does cut nice round doughnuts, the steel used is rather thin. Thus, it's fairly easy to misshape.It's also slow to work with because I find that the dough sticks to it and I have to push each doughnut out before cutting the next.After paying attention at some doughnut shops, it looks like the pros use a cutter of a different design. Look for the ones by Johnson-Rose and KegWorks.Stainless Steel Donut Cutter"
4,you can get there from here.,"Charming and practical is this witty, direct and compelling narrative. There are well written descriptions of fun sounding historical and current places. I actualy had growing anticipation while traveling to the jump off point of yet another jaunt on the narrow road. On the ground, the instructions are easy to follow. The landmarks are as advertised and obvious. Jackson County Iowa does not sound exciting but take a cruise down the lanes between St Donatus and the Mississippi and you will not miss the rock faces and the stations of the cross in 'little Luxembourg'. Lime kilns and limestone homesteads and the way to get there a hundred years ago and who they were. Here is literature that is good and good for you."
2,Lid on pot is not safe,"I recently purchased an All-Clad cookware pot because our Revere Ware pot handle broke after 30 years of daily use. Because Revere Ware went out of business, we were unable to replace like with like. So I searched around for a 'high-quality' brand. All Clad was recommended by our local kitchenware store. The pot was on sale, but nevertheless, quite expensive. The first time we used it, we realized we were not entirely happy with this brand. The handle on the pot lid is stainless steel and gets VERY hot. You HAVE TO use an oven mitt to remove the lid or you will be burned badly. I called the company to express our dissatisfaction with the product. The Customer service rep's response: You have to use an oven mitt or you will be burned and this is not covered by warranty. Hmmmm. I am writing this review to let folks know of this before you purchase All-Clad cookware."
3,Poor little rich girl,"Ione Gakis, one of the richest young women in the world, yearns for freedom. When her father orders her to marry Greek tycoon Alexio Christoulakis, Ione secretly plans to disappear without a trace on the wedding night. However, this one is a little darker than most of her other stories. There is not any of that offbeat humor some of the stories have and I gave it three stars because I didn't care for the resolution of the conflict between Ione and her father. When he is dying, she goes back to be with him and gets all upset that he's helpless. A better plot conflict would have been that she didn't go back and Alexio won't understand why."
3,My least favorite Lynne Graham book!!!,"Ok...so in my opinion, this book is not that great, in fact, it is the worst Lynne Graham book I've read.First, it was a little too dark for me, almost to the point of being depressive! I didn't care for the immature nature of Ione- always trying to run away, and couldn't face up to anything or anyone! She didn't even seem to want to do anything with her life, didn't seem to have any dreams, hopes, aspirations, nothing! She was like a teenager- agreed she was confined but hello, did she even get any form of education beyond the high school education we were told about? I have another Lynne Graham book and I'm pretty sure that will wipe away this one off my memory. Go Lynne Graham- I still love your books :D"
5,Invaluable resource,"I am an R.N. and work as a consultant in a law firm. Most of my hospital experience was in obstetrics so personal injury and worker's compensation cases were a challenge. I called a friend who works for a local orthopedist. He recommended Blauvelt's and Nelson's ""A Manual of Orthoppaedic Terminology"". It has been a tremendous resource for me. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who needs a quick reference for orthopedic, rehab and neurosurgical terms."
2,The player feels and looks great...,"But the software sonic stage made this by far the worst mp3 player I have ever owned. I suggest you try iaudio. I've had 3 of them (sold one, gave the other one away, and kept one for myself). Easy to upload music, and no headaches like sonicstage. With Iaudio it took me minutes to upload music. With sonicstage it took me 3 entire days (with the computer running) to upload the 4,000 songs. Pathetic."
4,The Sound is Incredible but I had to exchange the original,"I bought the Sony HD3 in lieu of the IPOD because of all the reviews I read stating that Sony had the best sound. I was not disapointed with the sound--it's amazing. HOWEVER, I had to exchange it after only four days because the flimsy power button bent when my fingernail accidentally slipped under it. The power button on this device is very thin and should anything get caught underneath it, it will easily bend. This is something Sony should consider modifying with the HD5 that is scheduled to be out this year.Also: The software is not the best but not as bad as some reviews would lead you to believe.The best reason to buy this MP3 player: The sound--it's awesome. Also the battery life is a plus but don't count on getting 30 hours unless you convert to the Sony format."
1,Network Walkman NW-HD3 - A Mixed Bag,"The NW-HD3 looks and sounds excellent. Navigation via the LCD display is ok but not quite as easy or as quick as on an iPod.The big drawback is the Sony Sonic Stage software that comes with the unit and that must be used to transfer tracks (there is no alternative). The software's faults include but are by no-means limited to; can't handle a large number of files (crashes), intermittantly hangs your PC, relies solely on ID3 information (i.e. often transfers files as 'Unknown Artist Unknown Track'), auto-transfer will re-transfer audio files that are already present on your NW-HD3 as additional files (resulting in many copies of the same tracks), has a confusing interface, requires frequent re-installation (which often requires completely re-formatting the NW-HD3), no longer supports importing Windows Media WMA audio files and is very 'processor intensive'.Software aside, I would give this product 4/5 stars. With the software I feel generous in awarding it 1/5."
1,Avoid it and spend your money wisely on some other player.,"I baught it and feel like throwing it from the highest floor for the following reasons;1... Like most MP3 players I have used you cannot drag and drop music files directly to the player.2... SonicStage Software used to ""manage"" the file transfers SUCKS. Sony should consider firing its software writing staff, or outsource its software from good people.3... No songs list. Can only list by Artist /Album/Genre/Group/Others. Dude where my file list?4... Why on earth do we need another audio format (OMG) ?5... Did I mention that the software sucks?Avoid till sony releases a better audio manager."
3,My Creative Muvo TX FM allows me to drag-and-drop MP3/WMA.,The previous poster is incorrect -- my Creative Muvo TX FM allows me to drag-and-drop MP3/WMA files directly to the device from the Windows Explorer.I'm not sure where that poster is getting their information.--Kevin
3,Odd,"These are obviously a prototype--not perfected yet. I thought it odd that they didn't give you dimensions for the uncollapsed bowls. I was looking for a container to carry in my purse for restaurant leftovers. These take up more room than I'd thought. Also, they take a fair amount of hand strength to push the bowls open. (And ripping them from their cardboard packaging took some strength, too.) On the positive side, they are very sturdy, and the seal is very tight. Would not recommend for seniors or for women who are trying to avoid arthritis. They'd be good for camping, though."
2,not reliable,cant be used to store anything... but we did use this as a soup bowl when we went camping...
1,Not good....,"Too fragile. The flowers are not solid, they're a thin layer folded to be double sided. The enamel wears off and the posts are too long for a child.Wold not recommend."
3,A nice book,"This book is nice to flip through, there are some very pretty photos that capture what it is to be in Maine. However, I found that a lot of these images were too focused on people, and not focused enough on images of Maine. The front cover is my favorite photo out of the whole book. I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in Maine."
2,Wait till you have to buy a bulb...,Jeez!My bulb lasted 2540 hours not 5000 or even the low end 3000...Now they want $314.00 for a replacement bulb???The clarity has never been that great. Forget vivid or sharp...If I had to do it over again I would spend some extra money and get real quality...This is a low end projector...
4,deceiving ad,As far as the product goes I have no problem with the phone.It has worked fine.My complaint is with amazon and the deceiving ad they have.The picture of the item shows 2 phone's.After receiving only one phone i contacted amazon.There comment was not our problem.They would not do anything at all to satisfy the customer which was me.They tried to put the blame on the retailer who I purchased it from.I tried to explain to them they were the one's who controlled thepictures they have posted.They would hear of it still would not take responsibility for theirscrew up and they still have not changed the pictures in the ad.
4,Northwestern bell 36070,"This was a gift, but the recipient was very pleased with the product. The product was delivered in a timely manner."
2,Not as Expected,"My mom, who has macular degeneration and cannot see well, had a hard time seeing the numbers and display. The blue backlight makes it difficult to see. I had to return the phones."
4,"Useful, excellent",I'm finding this book really helpful. It explains more clearly what other books do not and is a good complement to other neurotransmitter-related self-help books.
3,Good enough,"The story started out a little dull for me, partly because I just finished a different book and was waiting for something exciting to happen. The plot was interesting enough: a murder mystery during the Civil War, and both the main characters were likable. However I wish that the author wrote about Zach with more feeling, like showing what was he thinking more, especially in the middle, when all it seems like he's doing is questioning suspects over and over. Also I don't really understand how he and Emmanuelle fell in love. In the first 'foreplay' scene, it seems that all of a sudden they were attracted to each otherout of nowhere! Usually I become emotionally attached to the characters, but I didn't for Zach and Emmanuelle. Still, overall the book was entertaining and around the middle of the book I couldn't put it down!"
2,A disapointment,"If ""Dreamer"" was a masterpiece, ""Around the city"" is a disapointment. Ms. Elias should walk in the right side: just jazz. She shouldn't try a ""mainstream"" album, trying to be ""funny"" instead the usual talented piano artist as she is. Perhaps was a trick from the marketing people, ""Eliane, goes to some accesible to the masses"". But for Eliane's old friends this doesn't work. Go back to old ways, dear Eliane."
2,absolutely not one of her best albums,I think that this Eliane Elias album is not one of her best to date; I prefer all of her other albums.
2,what a disappointment!,"first...i am not good at English. sorry. anyway as one of great Asian fan of her , this album is very disappointed to me.i perper to previous album ""Dreamer"". but this album is too electrical, impersonnal and can't feel kind of soul...love...l perfer to listen acoustic musicyou must listen before buy it, please..."
5,Great Album,This is a wonderful album. For fans of Eliane or people who love jazz. Very enjoyable. Thank you Ms Elias!
4,It's one of my favourite series,"While I agree with other reviewers that yes, the series leaves much to be desired, I still believe this series is a suitable crossover between simple humourous entertainment and actually dealing with the issue presented, gender dichotomies."
5,Met Endurance,I use this drink mix primarily before long runs. It really does make a difference. I feel I can run longer without the need to ingest carbs along the way. The taste is okay and it easily mixes with water without a blender.
3,the way is lost,"este es el album mas debil de la banda dentro de los 80's. debio haber sido un album doble como originalmente se penso para poder rescatarlo de la abulia. ""stranger"" es el mejor tema del disco sin lugar a dudas. prescindible."
5,As Good As ELO Gets,"I agree with reviewers of this and other ELO CDs that this is one of the most uderappreciated bands of all time. This CD is superb, with exquisite slow stuff - Time After Time and Take Me On and On - and musical rock that still gives me chills - Four Little Diamonds and Rock 'n Roll is King. If you like early ELO, you will love this CD."
3,Why all the 5 star reviews?,"Not sure why I see five star reviews for this album. If this is 5 star, then what would El Dorado, New World Record and Out of the Blue rate? I give this 3 stars for Rock N Roll is King (I admit that this is a great song), Four Little Diamonds (strong song), and Secret Messages (very good song), the rest to me is extremely weak. I can handle the fact that the orchestra part of this band has been gone for a few albums, but to me, this is just a putrid effort by the remaining members of the band. Do yourself a favor and pick up the three albums I mentioned and then go write some 5 star reviews. This release was not worth it."
5,One of ELO's Best,"Fell in love with this album in college...played it over and over. Somehow, I lost my CD during those hectic days...adding it back because I miss it. ""Bluebird"" and ""Stranger"" are classic ELO tracks, and ""Take Me On And On"" is a haunting piece. ""Four Little Diamonds"" is this album's ""Don't Bring Me Down."""
4,Adjust your sets,"This is a bastard child of the Clash ouvre. In spite of all the odds it succeeds as a CD you want to own to listen repeatedly. Not because you realise it is a stellar collection of odds 'n sods, but because it has a mess that you sinfully wish to share only with close friends and other relatated initatiates into its kabbalistic charms. Not LONDON CALLING, not GIVE 'EM ENOUGH ROPE, not COMBAT ROCK, but the black sheep of the family, the one you dare not mention anyone's name. Outstanding tracks include ""Cheat"" and ""Robber's Dub."" Even when illegitimate The Clash RULES!"
5,great book,I thought this was a great book to read; it was also and easy read. This book was very creative with its views and points. I recommend everyone to read this book.
5,Really eye-opening book about people and technology!,"I loved this book...the ideas Yudkowsky presents really got me thinking about how social and organizational decisions can have such a serious impact on how technologies succeed or fail,and what impact technology has on the quality of our lives. The topics in some of the chapters have also sparked some very interesting conversations at the office (I work in the technology lab of a big management consulting firm)...which is always fun!"
4,Breaking things down to build them anew works!,"Moshe Yudkowsky proposes a thought-provoking premise: Breaking entities apart causes more progress and development than building them does. As this is the opposite of conventional thought, it is remarkable how well he is able to illustrate and defend the view in these few chapters. Using the breakup of AT&T; as a primary - but far from the only - example, he shows how increased competition foments innovation.This book will appeal to anyone with an interest in business management, government or history. It should probably be a must-read for students of all of those disciplines."
5,A long time Oracle and Mysql programmer learns the basics of ADO.NET,"--A Concise Reference with only the useful information. ADO.NET really does take a different approach from the other database API's. I have worked alot with JDBC, MySql (via java and PHP), Oracle and ODBC. In ADO.NET, the concept of a disconnected Dataset forces you to rely heavily upon Microsoft's Object model. The alternative to this book seemed to be either: Search through MSDN's reference material Or Purchase one of the many books which regurgitate the steps in using the wizards. The MSDN reference material really did not show me the expected ""idioms"" or paradigms in writing function db applications. This book helped me to understand what is really happening beneath these opaque designs. It helped me to understand and solve some of the necessities in creating data driven ASP.NET DB applications."
4,Very Helpful.,"I have thumbed through a few .net and one ado.net books and this has been pretty much the most useful for me. The other ado.net book by David Sceppa was ok, but typical for Microsoft, its heavy on the wizards and stuff so I didn't learn as much as I might have. Plus, in my case, the wizards didnt always work because I was trying to hook up to FoxPro, not SqlServer. This book has a tendency to see things from Sqlservers point of view too, even though ado.net can work with alot of rdbmss. Anyway, if you are familiar with Oreillys nutshell books, Unix in a Nutshell for example, you will have an idea of what is up with this book. Its an excellent addition to Oreillys line."
2,size of cup,"this is a childs cup, the size is not specifed but it appears to be full size in the pictures. Kind of deceiving, fortunately easy to return"
1,You should buy this game if:,"A) You are a new gameboy developer interested in seeing how not to design a game.B) You have a Gameshark and want to use the unlimited pinball cheat code.C) You are interested in who not to hire for your next gameboy development project. You can access their names from the main screen in the software.This game has several tables to choose from, but they are all very bad. The physics are terrible."
1,Waste of Money,"Don't buy this. It's like 4 girls and some of the scenes are looped. If you want to waste your money, but this movie"
3,Good Daisy Episodes This Season,"With Bo & Luke gone for a big majority of this season we do see some pretty good Daisy Duke moments like her rescue attempt on ""Coy Meets Girl"" I always loved watching Daisy fight. I never thought Coy & Vance were as good as Bo & Luke but they were ok. Some of these shows are just as good as they were with Bo & Luke. Plus Bo & Luke are on this set towards the end of the season they return. One of my favorite episodes was ""Daisy's Shotgun Wedding"" which is on this set. I like the box cover art too. Daisy only. It makes up for the cover the previous set of Season 4 had where Daisy was not pictured at all."
5,Great!!!,"The Coy and Vance season.I'm glad Warner is releasing this season as well.And it is coming out the same day as the new movie hits DVD.I like the cover with Daisy,now why would Warner not have Coy and Vance on the cover with her?Sorry i'm being dumb!I know everybody hated Coy and Vance! But I'm looking forward to seeing there episodes,I never scene them all.I hope Bryon Cherry and Christopher Mayer will be included on the special features section if there is any?I would like to here what the 2 stars have to say?Well I'm looking forward to season 5 on DVD! And I think Warner has been doing a great job with there TV shows on DVD."
5,Great buy,I was happy to find both of these movies in one at a good price. It arrived in the time frame and I am excited to give it to my son on Christmas.
5,ANOTHER GREAT SEASON!!,EVEN THO BO AND LUKE ARENT IN ALL OF IT IT IS STILL A VERY GOOD SEASON AND WITH 8 DISKS AND 22 episodes it is one of the longer ones too.it is a must have for every dukes fan now all i need is season 6 witch is releised on may 30th 2006 and season 7 witch the release date has not been released.lol
4,Dukes of Hazzard,I have always have loved Dukes of Hazzard and I'm glad it came on DVD and I'm wondering if there are more from the series
5,Gift,I got this as a gift for my nephew. He loves the Dukes of Hazzard. The gift came just in time for christmas. I would totally recommend this.
3,Good - NOT as 1,"Commonly suffering from the sequel's syndrome, AITD2 provides less horror, less suprise and less atmospheric values than its predecessor.It has also moving bugs, some weird issues in the inventory and some other minimal bugs.Still worth having it however, for a collector's library is simply not complete without it."
4,Twisted,"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS JUST GOING TO BE ABOUT JAIL AND HOW HARD WOMEN HAVE IT IN JAIL....BOY WAS I WRONG. THIS MOVIE WAS EXCELLENT. IT CAPTIVES YOU FROM THE OPENING SCENE TO THE END. I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE MADE A SEQUEL, JUST TO CONTINUE THE SUSPENSE. I EVEN SHARED THIS MOVIE WITH FAMILY FRIENDS AND THEY ENJOYED IT. THIS IS A MUST TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION."
2,Wtf ?,"This move was wack as hell ! lmao some of the parts were hilarious. Even though this was not suppose to be a funny movie. Omg the storyline was corny, the acting was corny .. smh I brought this, watched it, and never put it back in my dvd player lol"
4,Stranger Indeed,"I just resently purchased this film to watch and it blew me away. Usually I don't watch independent films, because the acting is not good and the film is quite choppy; however this movie was recommended to see the struggles of women life story while in prison. The main character Treasure Lee was looking for acceptance from a mother ""Brownie"" who didn't even know her existence. Treasure allowed the system to be place of residence and for her gang ""GG's"" to become her family. Throughout the movie you saw Treasure and Brownie became a family and how Treasure pushed the ones that always had her back against the wall. The director did a wonderful job of keeping the storyline interesting and allowing the viewers a true peek inside the correctional facilities. The ending definitely throws you for a loop."
5,pump leathers,Purchased for a 70 yr old hand pump used as a back up in my hunting cabin. Has become difficult to find the correct valve leather for a reasonable price. Quality and price are good. Bought two so should last me for 10 yrs.
3,Not For Me,"I knew before buying this bag that it was going to be big, I have another bag from the same company and it is big also. This bag however is a little too big. When I got it it was good at first, but after two days I didn't like it so much I started using a fanny pack. It's good quality and is cute, but a little to big and clunky on my part."
5,great idea!,"a night light and a reading light all in one!Use this on its lowest setting for a night light, crank it upto read or for lovely, soft room light. A nice warm color.Love it!"
4,Super Funny Fast Bad Meat,"Bad Meat finally is released, this movie was brought to us by the guyswho created The Onion Satirical Magazine...Lance Barber is the new John Belushi! Chevy Chase gives a grossly funny peformance,and the stream of cameos from some of Chicago's best comic actors make this movie a must see for any Second City fan...my stomach got sore from laughing at Bad Meat, I loved it!Bad Meat"
4,Pierrot Le Fou,"First off, let me say that this film is not for everybody. If you love foreign cinema, then you should love this. It is classic Godard. His use of color and composition is outstanding. This was the first Godard film I saw in color and I was amazed by it. There is a nice cameo by director Sam Fuller. Those who are Godard fans must watch this. You will not be let down."
1,Artsy-Fartsy,It's beneath the artist to explain his work. You'll just have to figure out the meaning of my review's title on your own.
3,A French Bonnie and Clyde,"Pierrot le fou, French for ""Pierrot the Fool"" although ""Fou"" is French for ""Crazy"", is a movie about a French man upset with his marriage and who goes on a crime spree across France with his ex-girlfriend. They steala car and go off. One memorable scene is when the go to the beach and drive the car into the water. I found the film hard to follow and don't remember much of it though.This is a 2 disc set with all of the special features in disc two. They are, a theatrical trailer, an interview with actress Anna Karina, ""A ""Pierrot"" Primer"", a look at the film with commentary by Jean-Pierre Gorin, ""Godard, l'amour, la poésie"", a documentary about director Jean-Luc Goddard and his marriage to Anna Karina, and archival interviews with Jean-Luc Godard, Anna Karina, and Jean-Paul Belmondo.This is a classic film but can be hard to follow for some people."
2,"Pseudo-intellectual, modernist, french, subtiteled film",If you enjoy thinking too much about bad B-movies you'll love this film
3,Is this the only DVD in print?,"It's great to have this entertaining film in widescreen and on DVD, however the mastering here is terrible. Either it's an old transfer or done on a short budget because the encoding here really is poorly executed. On my television Anna Karina's jawbones looked like they were built of Legos. This film deserves better. Maybe Criterion will come out with a version. If you don't care about the presentation and are just dying to see this film again the money is probably worth it."
5,travesty,"Fox Lorber did a barely competent job of issuing this movie on DVD, but at least it's available (alas, unlike ""Masculine-Feminine""). The least Fox could do is keep the damn thing in print, so that people who want to own it don't have to pay $70.00 for a used copy. This is one of the most exciting films made in the last fifty years; it's not perfect, but it's an utterly fascinating milestone in the history of the cinema. Fox Lorber, get this thing back in print. Shame on you."
3,Tough stuff.,"Knowing tha Michael Brecker was terminally ill when he entered the studio to make this CD, makes reviewing his music difficult. All the cuts are original compositions. Because I like to at least begin with a tuneful melody before prolonged individual riffs and improvisations, Ihad a difficult time with 2/3s of thew cuts. He as a Coltrane influenced sax player so those who enjoy Coltrame may very well appreciate this more than I. Meanwhile, rest in peace, Michael."
4,Brecker shines as a composer,"This last effort by sax giant Michael Brecker is a gem. The level of playing is vertiginous, but for me, the music is the real joy here. The compositions are elaborate but they get to you. The CD has been playing in my car for weeks. Each listen brings out new details, richer textures."
4,What a group.,"Michael Brecker, Accompanied by Herbie Hancock, Brad Mehldau, Pat Metheny, Jack DeJohnette, and John Patitucci. How wrong can you be buying this album?Although all compositions are by MB, and because of the strong influence of the group, you would sometime think that it could be a Herbie Hancock album or Pat Metheney or any of the others in the band. Every single track is well organized, tight, and well memorable for many years to come.A well recommended Album; by all means."
5,Outstanding album,"Michael Brecker was surprisingly (given his illness) up to the task, and performs brilliantly. The writing is among his best, and he has a great group. Jack DeJohnette really drives the band, with great solos delivered by Herbie Hancock and Pat Metheny. Easily the most important album of the year."
1,Worst ever!,"DO NOT buy the ""Chef"" John Folse frozen gumbos! The chicken and sausage tastes like a 33 cent instant gravy pack from Wal-Mart, and the seafood gumbo tastes like a bowl of file with no roux....THIS FOOD IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF SOUTH LOUISIANA."
1,A triumph of style over substance,"When I ordered this book, even when I packed it for winter holiday in the Midwest, I had high hopes - it was well-reviewed in Amazon, and Lanham is a well-respected scholar. Yet the only point on which the book succeeds is Chapter 3, in which Lanham fully develops a theory of the benefits of self-conscious artifice - which has little, if anything, to do with economic theory. Lanham admits he is no economist; this might explain his adoration of libertarian economic thought, which of course, is more a faith than a theory. ""Don't worry, be happy"" is Lanham's response to anyone who questions any possible negatives associated with technology or the market. Ultimately, these are the only real ""lessons"" of the book - awareness of communicative ""styles"" make us better communicators (a valid point, but hardly new), and a McFerrinesque attitude towards risk and responsibility. Hardly worthy of the pulp it is printed on."
2,Didn't hold my Attention,"I gave up on this book after 80 pages. Either he doesn't have much of value to say, or he doesn't realize reader attention is scarce enough that he needs to show early on that the book contains valuable ideas."
3,10 x 20 camo tarp,"It's an ok tarp, with the exception of the POOR quality of the grommets with which mine came equipped. One is bent out of shape, apparently by the machine or person which pressed it in. And at least one other that I've noticed is separating from the tarp material such that it will probably fall out of its place under stress before much longer. Sorry for the bad report, but there is a serious quality control issue at the manufacturer, or such does not even exist. Did not send it back, because of how desperately I needed it, but feel like I should have. Oh well, maybe mine just slipped thru the cracks of inspection."
5,Ben Walker,"I love this cd because i really think it is tight.ICP has always been my favorite band ever. I may be really slow at skool and flunked the seventh grade, but i know a good cd when i hear one.I have 3 of their shirts."
2,alexziq,"IM AN OLDER JUGGALO WHO IS ALSO A MUSICIAN AND I HAVE TO SAY ICP NEEDS TO STICK WITH MIKE P. THE EP SEEMS VERY WEAK TO ME, BOTH THE MUSIC AND THE RAPPING SEEMS VERY RUSHED,AND NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT. I LOVE ICP AND I HOPE THIS IS NOT THE STYLE THEY WILL USE IN THE YEARS TO COME. STILL,IF YOU LOVE ICP YOU WILL WANT TO CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF."
2,"I dunno ,","I dont really like this CD at all , but my Lo does so it wasnt a complete waste of money . When it arrivd the case was broken . I dont really remmeber who long it took though . But I wont buy from this person again ."
1,i agree with joehiphophead,"anybody that gave this album or any insane clown p*ssy album more than one star is a trendy choadlicker that has no taste, and no respect for hip hop and further more no respect for music in general you homo's all deserve to be deaf mutes because your your opinions based on your sense of sound only bring the rest of the world down because your opinions on music are f*cking worthless. guys should all go buy some tents and live in hot topic for the rest of your worthless lives and never bother the rest of the general respectable public"
1,What is this?,"Insane Clown Posse used to be one of those bands you could listen to and laugh at, and enjoy their music. Sadly, this CD is not something any person should ever listen to. The lyrics are horrible and generally rap about completely stupid things or nothing at all.I know, this all sounds like standard ICP. It's not the same though. This CD is a mix of upbeat rap music that only a moron could enjoy. They talk about how baby mommas are bothering them, or how they want to bounce pogo sticks off of your face. This is truly the bottom of the barrel. ICP has some decent albums, but this just isn't one of them."
2,Is it just me or do they keep getting worse?,"Ok...now before all you other Juggalos get pissed I just want you to know that I'm going to be COMPLETELY honest with this review...I'm a Juggalo too but I would never tell someone to buy a CD that I felt wasn't any good...To tell the truth I haven't like very much since Shangri La: The Wraith...the beats have seemed to change a bit and so has Violent J's delivery with his lyrics...however the song ""Rollin Over"" is great and sounds like their older stuff. The other songs I like are ""We'll Be Alright"" and ""Deadbeat Moms"" w/Esham, but the chorus totally sucks and sounds like it took 3 seconds to come up with...So I say if you're collecting CD's buy it, if you're looking for a good CD buy one of their older ones or buy KMK's upcoming CD."
2,better than hells pit but where did ICP go?,"The clowns I know sing chicken huntin and Piggy Pie with some wicked sh*t mixed in like dead body man. Hells Pit was horrible. Not one track on that CD was tolerable. Now Ive been down for 8 years but I have to say that since they got rid of Mike Clark ICP isnt ICP anymore. It's either the producing or J seems to have let the weed get to his head and thinks everything sounds good. This CD is an improvement over hells pit but not much. Atleast they are back to thier comedic ways but its still not to the likes of Riddlebox or Milenko. Only two songs are bangin and the rest are just ok. The only terrible song on the CD is ""We Like It Like That"" because thety repeat that saying every 5 seconds...literaly. The Best song on the cd is Rollin Over which is somewhat back to their roots. In my opinion, ICP needs Mike Clark back and needs to realize why we all became juggalos in the first place. Get back to your roots ICP!!!!!"
3,"Decent, but still not old school ICP","The Calm is the first cd that ICP have produced entirely themselves, and it was okay. I liked ""Rollin' Over"" and ""Rosemary,"" but the rest of the songs were pretty sub-par. I'm glad that ICP finally came to their senses and got back with Mike E. Clark, because their music was slowly but surely dying without him."
1,Disappointed,"I would have liked to know the density of the padding: Example: 1 through 5 - soft, medium, firm, extra firm, etc. The padding is on the soft side; it gave me some lower back pain, even on a semi firm surface. Also the mat could be a little wider and a little longer. I returned the item mainly because of the back pain. I wish amazon would look for a mat that is say 2 1/2 to 3 feet wide and 6 feet long with some firmness."
2,What padding?,"I was disappointed with the ability of this mat to cushion my sitting bones while doing P90X (P90X+) ab routines. The 3/4"" floor matting I use does a little better job, and what's the point of adding this on top of the matting if the padding immediately gives way when you sit on it? Padding needs to pad."
1,Tearing at seams,"My daughter bought the mat for me as a gift for my daily work out routine. It's used 20 minutes a day, 6 days a week for floor exercises after aerobics and it's already falling apart at the seams, near the carrying handles. We take very good care of it, and put it away when it's not in use. I am really disappointed, I purchased a mat from Target five years ago which was more dense for almost half the price, and it is in better shape and I will start using it instead of Harbinger. If you buy this mat, please be aware that it can start to fall apart at the seams quickly, especially near the carrying handles."
2,Gaps between pads,I returned this item because there was a big gap between two of the pads when it was laid out flat. I have another mat of a different manufacturer which does not have this problem.This mat is too squishy for Pilates.
1,Fell apart before it had been used for 1 month,"This was bought for my husband's daily work out routine. It's used maybe 30 minutes a day, 6 days a week for stretching and some light yoga and it's already falling apart at the seams, near the carrying handles. We take very good care of it, and put it away when it's not in use. I am really disappointed, we had seen a similar product for almost half the price, but went with this one because of all the positive reviews. If you buy this mat, please be aware that it can start to fall apart at the seams quickly, especially near the carrying handles."
5,"Great exercise mat, does the job",I was debating whether to buy the name brand blue exercise mats or this... but ultimately I could not justify paying the extra money for the blue ones. I was pleasantly surprised. This mat has the right thickness and comfort for doing sit ups. I highly recommend. It has held up well in the last 7 months since purchased.
5,GREAT MAT FOR SIT-ups,This is a great mat for doing situps and calesthenic type stretching at home. It is thicker than a yoga mat. It folds up in three and has handles which make it very easy to stash away.
5,Comfort Yes!,"I love this mat. Though it is firm, it has decent cush and is comfortable. I could not find anything beyond the thin yoga types usually sold until I saw this one and it is just what I needed for my back - worth the extra money."
4,Nocturnal... and a step back,OK... if you liked Nocturnal Beast (their last album) then you shall enjoy this... same thing... starts with a short intro and then goes right into the music. The music itself is great- typical Lord Belial- starts out with soft strums and then gets into the heaviness. Becklin still has that awesome demonic voice... but it must be giving out because on a few of the tracks he has a lot of guest vocalists (which in my opinion ruin the songs simply because it ruins it... there is one track with someone doing hardcore vocals that don't match Becklin's black metal ones... so it throws off the song entirely).Vocal disputes aside... the album is still worth it for any Lord Belial fan and anyone else who is into black metal. Plus the album cover is just awesome...just hope in the future they bring back the female vocals that were on Seal and Unholy War... those were what got me into this band.
1,Do not dim well and VERY short life,"I have CFL through my home and my camp and I have since they came on the market. This is the only brand I have ever had fail to date -- some are 8 to 10 years old and still working. These bulbs have lasted less than 1 year. But even worse long before they fail, they start getting VERY dim.I use them in an open fixture and the base with the transformer and electronics shows signs of overheating -- NOT a good situation. I am now concerned that they may overheat even in an open light fixture. This does raise safety concerns.The dimming is very poor on these too. I do have other dimmables that work fine, but since the dimming is so poor on these I do not use them in anything other than full brightness."
2,Short life span. Not worth the money,"I purchased ~3 dozen of these bulbs to replace incandescent bulbs in various fixtures around my house. Many with a dimmer many without. I replaced every bulb in my bathroom vanity light. Within 4 months they are all dead (don't light or light very dimly). Note these are lights that get used 2-3 hours a day tops. I have also had 4-5 others go in other light fixtures such as hall lights (which again get used very infrequently). Out of the 3 dozen I purchased 4 months ago only about 6 of them work still.Not a good buy. Stick to incandescent bulbs for now. Now I have to wait for ""hazmat"" day at the dump to dispose of them."
2,"Good dimming range, annoying noise","I have recently bought this brand of bulb and two others. These ULA bulbs are probably the best for dimming smoothly over a wide range from bright to dim, although they still won't go as low as incandescents. Unfortunately, I can't use them in most rooms because of the noise they create. It is audible even at full power, and gets louder as the bulbs are dimmed. If you have a room where there is background noise all the time, these will be okay, but my house isn't like that.The other brands? GE was much quieter, but had a very limited dimming range. Sylvania was the best compromise for me - much quieter than ULA and much better dimming than GE."
2,Extremely short working life!!!,"These bulbs do work with dimmer switches, however, they don't work very long. Over half of my bulbs have failed...some within days, and some within a few months. This brand is sold on Amazon and ebay at extremely low prices, but if you factor in the cost of replacement, you're not saving all that much. You are better off with a name brand from a company like GE who will promptly replace your bulb if it fails."
3,Limited Life,"While most of them are great and do dim down to 30 % or so, I have had 2 lamp failures out of the 18 that we use in our home. The units that failed were the cfl spiral, but all 6 par floods are working just fine. Two out of 12 is too high a failure rate, but for now the next step is too expensive for me which would be LED lighting that is not dimmable."
1,67% failure rate after ONE DAY.,"I purchased 2 packs (4 bulbs) of ULA's ""Dimmable"" CFL's yesterday. Installed 3 of them yesterday and today 2 of them no longer work. This is unbelievable. ""Lasts up to 7 years"" the box says. These didn't last seven hours. They didn't cost much, but they would be a bad buy at any price."
2,The Rub,The light quality is fine. But the buzzing from the bulbs is quite irritating when they are even slightly dimmed.
1,Disappointed,"I have an X-10 home automation system that I use to turn on and off the outside lights (among other things). I bought these in hope that they would work on the outside. While the light goes on and off using the switch (which most CFLs will not), they do not work with the X-10 system...I must manually turn the light on or off. In contrast, the old dimmable Philips Earth Lights that I have all work with the X-10 system. Problem is, I can't buy them anymore. Overall, I was pretty disappointed."
2,Dimmable flourescent bulbs,"These sounded positively too good to be true, a flourescent bulb that dims! While this is true the 10,000 hour life time promised by theses type of bulbs is a pipe dream. I did not get more than two months out of any bulb, they hummed, and they are toxic. You can't just throw them away they contain mercury. The minus's and the headaches of constantly changing the bulbs and finding somwhere to dispose of these is NOT worth the savings in energy!"
1,You get what you pay for,I purchased about 20 of these. After 6 months 3 are still working. They are great for about 2 weeks and quickly die after that.
2,4 pack Dimmable 23w CFLs UL America,"The bulbs were shipped promptly. They did not work for my dining room light fixture application, as they are bright white, not cool white. I contacted the distributor to return them and they cheerfully refunded my purchase price."
4,It's like cheesy poofs -- light & salty,"John Waters' ""tamest"" (is there such a thing?) movie to date, worth watching. The dvd's audio commentary track does give some insight into director Waters' ability to get what he wants out of an actor, and Ricki Lake gets points for sheer likeability (the same likeability that landed her a syndicated talk show). No truly clever or startling moments (which are a Waters' trademark), but the movie WORKS. Drag impersonator ""Divine"" is convincing his dual role.Oh yeah, that ""Pecker"" movie is okay too, although I'd have liked it better if they'd done a ""Serial Mom / Hairspray"" 2-pack."
2,Not what i expected,"I just received this locket, which was intended to be a gift for my niece for x-mas, and had to decline on giving it to her. when i received it, i actually thought Amazon forgot to put it in the bag it came in. I shook the bag, felt for the necklace, and finally out popped this itty bitty tiny heart pendant. it's so small, i thought it was more suitable for her doll then for herself. i was very disappointed. other then the size and over priced tag, i thought it was cute - but i will be returning it.sorry!"
3,"Helped for Judo and Juijitsu, but not up to par..","I really needed pads for Judo practice, my kneed constantly were getting injured, these help ALOT: However, the nature of Judo requires non stop action and these knee pads can not keep up, they constantly start to fall down and with alot of use the threads come loose.. The material and padding quality is excellent, just be prepared to keep pulling the up.."
4,A good pair of kneepads,"These kneepads offer great protection and decent mobility. They can be worn with an infrapatellar brace for extra support. Unfortunately, they don't breathe very well so sweat may be an issue for some users."
1,Wrong and Wrong.,"What I ordered was supposed to be a XXL. When I got it, the packaging said XXL, however it wouldn't fit. Why? Because the item in the packaging in only XL. I paid extra to have this rush delivered because my job is killing my knees, I have to crouch down on the ground a lot. Now, I have to wait to get this sorted out. I am not happy. Oh, and I thought it was sold in pairs, I only got one not one pair."
4,Cromprehensive book,Book is well written and covers the Garand and Carbine fairly thoroughly. Helps in identifying Garands and Carbines. A handy addition to your Garand library.
3,Good effort,"It is not Oscar's greatest productions but it has a few good songs in it. Overall I liked the ""fuziones"" that he made with different rhythms. I personally dislike ""regeaton"" so I was unpleasantly surprised a mix song in there. But the salsa songs in this CD , and the flavor that only DeLeon bring into it makes the CD a good one overall."
2,"Blah,","I like the othger ones I got after this better. These pinch at the hips and make me look misshapen and hippy. To tight at the hip. I love the Champion C9 Ebony shorts better---- no seam in the crack, so they never ride up---so mpveable and breathable!"
2,Kinda Boring,This was the first UFC event that I thought was boring. I got it anyways as I am collecting them all. One good fight in it IMO.
4,It's a pitty,"I share the judgement of Avid Reader. Jennifer Pope's Novels are so much away from the normal ""nosense"" stuff around. Nexus still is to thank to release all the former novels. It's still valid: for someone interested in Pony-BDSM and a nice and good story Jennifer Pope is the one to look for"
5,finally found this hard-to-find item!,"this creme has disappeared from store shelves and i'm sooo happy to have found it on amazon! it's a fantastic night cream for fine lines, but may be a bit thick for daytime use. i recommend thinning it with a little water."
4,"Not bad, aquaphor is better","I'm only 20, so anti-wrinkle cream is jumping the gun a little...I bought this to use as a simple sensative skin cream...but it's very thick and I just didn't like the way it feels. I stick to my very thin layer of aquaphor that works like a charm!"
4,"""Mellow""","Having fallen in love with the Slowdive sound, then basking in the extremely EXPERIMENTAL (read: unfinished and patchy at best) last album ""Pygmalion"", I took my time in buying Neil and Rachel's new spin-off.Truth be told, it's actually not that bad, and certainly not as spare as the aforementioned album, which is a good thing; the band makes good use of its strengths (melodiousness, a country fetish, excellent harmonies), and we're left with an album that Mazzy Star fans should probably buy if they haven't already."
1,Movie fun - VHS condition so so,"The tape was used and was not in the condition I expected. A bit worn and not even rewound. I will not buy from that vendor again. I found the DVD on Gwar site after I ordered the VHS. The tape was only $3, would not have paid 50cents at a flea market for this seeing the condition."
4,chilly little thriller,"no offense to the other reviewer but i really don't see how you can say this one is better than 2...two was epic and nothing short of a masterpiece. and frankly i thought one kind of sucked...every boss was the same..did have a eerie setting though in a mansion. but in 3 you're basically in a haunted cowboy town out west..still shooting zombie like people(this was before zombies were an annoying trend). i'm sorry i really don't have alot to say on this game except old horror really needs to be more appreciated..this is when horror actually meant horror and not shooter. back when you don't know if you're going to have a weapon at some point and just have to use your environment to stay alive..back when the characters had a unique background and story meant something..and being thrilled was the main emphasis. other oldschool horror i would recommend are D, clock tower, and indigo prophesy."
5,farmstead theamaste,Was giving as a Christmas gift. Was enjoyed by my inlaws and placed in the new shop for them to see.
4,"Nice for the price, but not 100%","Good crock pot for the price. Great size. High doesn't get Hot enough. Unable to brown items or heat quickly at the start. Comes up to a medium temp and then takes quite a while to fully heat food through and cook. It is a slow cooker, but it is REALLY, REALLY slow. Lid doesn't have rubberized seal, so not tight fit. Feel like there's some heat loss due to that too. And, Wouldn't trust it to transport food. Display is nice. Buttons work and handles on sides really nice. Not too heavy to move around the kitchen. Made some really nice chili, pork and beef stew. Use it a couple times a month at least."
3,Slow Cooker,"I only have two complaints: 1. Outside unit is extremely thin. Very afraid of denting it. 2. When I was searching for my slow crocker I was looking for one made in the USA. Was very disappointed in all of the reviews for other brands. This one had very little to read on for it seemed to be a new one, but the reviews it did get where good. In looking into the brand I am pretty sure I ran across it being made in the USA. So I decide to try it. Upon delivery and opening we were very disappointed to find it says it's made in China. NOT A HAPPY CAMPER WAS I!!!All in all it's not bad. Still upset that it's not USA brand. We try to keep our purchases american made but seems I either was duped or miss read something."
4,"So far, so good!","I was looking for a non ""crock pot"" slow cooker since I didn't have the greatest luck with my last two. I also wanted a somewhat large cooker at a reasonable price. This slow cooker fit the bill and with no sales tax and free shipping it was a great bargain. The cooker works well and I love being able to program the exact time I want it to cook. It automatically switches to the warm setting once the cooking interval has been met. The only thing I don't like is that the outside gets really hot. So be careful with that. I've used it probably 10 times thus far...and so far so good!"
3,Continues to boil.,"Mine continues to boil whether on high or warm, so I still use it, but it is not a slow cooker. Wish I had noticed this right after purchase. It would have gone back."
1,Horrendus,"Who on planet Earth would pay a hard earned [...] to for this [...]? This game features a character based on some old preschooler show (that should set off an alarm.) The graphics just plain suck, even for a 96-bit handheld like the DS. It took me 30 minutes to beat it. WHO WOULD PAY [...] A MINUTE TO PLAY THIS GAME?!?!? Not me. And neither should you. If you want a REAL DS game, buy Super Mario 64 DS."
4,Kymera - A new promise,"I have not heard this album yet, It contains a song "" Looking for You"", which was written by Don Barnes of 38 Special. Don wrote this song for a record company that got absorbed by another giant. This song was to be released as a solo album project for Don around 89 or 90. I have always been disapointed that Don Barnes was not recognized for his great work on that album. Many great tunes were passed over and sit in some archive because the record company wants to hold his work for ransom. I guess a little of his brilliance will shine through with these artists. If they do half as well on their version of this song, they should have several hits off of this album. Strickly MY opinion."
4,Very Good AC,"I've used this AC unit the past 2 hot summers to save me while I'm sleeping. The direction of the AC was directed downward too much so I had to remove the front air diverters, but the temperature can go down to the low 60s. It's very good."
3,Not too bad but not that good,"I am listening Michael Bolton for two years and I can easily say this is the Boltons first hopefully rock album (from his old rock'n roll days) If you really want to hear some 80's pop-rock sound with Michaels growling voice this will be great.Why?Because album also icludes a few nice slow rock ballad and some kinetic rock'n roll energy, however recording is not that good they had to record and mix it again because you can not hear the other sounds which stand near the main melody"
2,"Great voice, Weak material","In this early effort by Michael Bolton, we get to hear Michaelbelt out some hard rockers. Unfortunately, the material isn'tup to par. I guess nobody wanted to waste good material ona relative unknown. Should Bryan Adams be worried based onthis effort? Not really. I think even Eddie Money is safe."
4,Delightful Techno-Trance Ahead of Its Generation,"The James Ray, publishing under ""The MK Ultra"" has popped out a pretty good techno-trance album that was honestly ahead of it's time. With tracks like ""Skin"" which share tonal harmonies and rhythmic synths with the likes of Juno Reactor and Underworld, if you are a fan of trance you should check out this CD.Production of this album appears to have been discontinued. You can download it for free at James Ray's website: http://thejamesray.co.uk/mkultra.php"
2,"Watch band is OK, however, doublecheck the attachment","The watchband itself is fine as a black leather 11 mm band, however, I have switched out the band on my watch over 10 times over many years and this is the first band that doesn't include the metal attachment with the band. This didn't seem to be a problem when I realized I could just use the attachment in the old band, however, the hole needed for the metal attachment that usually comes with a band wasn't there on the new band.Bottom line is that I had to return this band, since I couldn't attach it to my old watch."
2,Band does not come with the pins,"I have ordered watch bands before, many times, and they come with pins--even when the description says nothing about pins. I needed to rummage around to find pins from other watches, which didn't fit. Can't wear my watch because the band won't stay attached."
3,Front or back ?,My QX4 has been fantastic for the last 11 years but the left side of the front seat is starting to fall appart. The problem with the add is that it only shows the back seats and niether shows nor says anything about the front seat which is the only ones I'm interested in. Maybe in this case you have to buy all or nothing but it doesn't say that either.
4,No more mess and finally peace of mind!,"We travel across the country twice a year staying in motels and camping. Trying to keep a few things cool with ice gets messy and I'm always wondering if the yogurt or margarine is still ""good"". The Koolatron cooler made it very convenient. We used it on an extended weekend trip in the car and in the hotel room. Worked great! Things were nice and cold and no more guessing!The only reason I wouldn't give it 4 stars is because I wish the cooler had a sling made of webbing so it would be easier to carry on a shoulder into the hotel room."
5,Nice Unit,This was a present for mother in law who lives in Florida. She has used it a few times and loves it. Has not been used long enough to rate durability but so far so good.
3,Good idea but questionable build quality,"I've used this for a few months now as I work on the road a lot and dont want to eat restaurant food. It's pretty big and I can fit lots into it. I got it with the ac outlet adapter so I can take it into the hotel room and keep things cold overnight. The concept is really simple. A set of plates on the inside and outside of the unit transfers heat to the outside. or vice versa if you flip the power plug. One fan motor powers a little set of fin blades on the inside and outside of the unit to move air over these plates. Problem I've found already is that the fin blades shift on the drive motor shaft and this causes them to wear on the housing and make loud noises. I had to take it apart and fix this a few times now. Kinda ridiculous for a $100 unit IMHO.It is definitely nice not having to worry about ice or cold packs, so take it for what its worth..... this is the first electric cooler I bought, so I cant compare to others."
4,Reliable product,"This device did it's intended job as advertised for two uninterrupted weeks while on the open flybridge under the hot Bahamian sun. Placed beverages in (sodas, juices and food, not beers) at room temperature for 6 hours while sailing and were pleasantly cool upon arrival."
3,Great until it breaks!! then throw it out and buy another!!,"This is a great product while it works.Ours broke and it costs over $50 to ship it back for service.I bought a new one and it has worked so far.If I had bought it from a local vendor I might have had it repaired.There were coolers, like the Coleman, that I could have gotten locally, but reviews of those were not good.Another good option is to live near the repair facility, Batavia NY."
2,Only worked for 4 days,"Stopped working after four days. Called the company, who was only willing to send out a replacement motor for the unit - they sent the wrong motor. Now it's trash."
1,fan is too loud.,I regret that I choose this item.I bought this for my uncle's gift. But fan's noise was too loud. The fan hit the wall of the cooler.I am disappointed.
3,"Expensive, for life of item.","Owned this cooler for just over a year, yes I did use it a lot as a truck driver. Fans have died making cooler / heater non operational and a possible fire hazard... when fans quit working the heat side of the exchanger got extremely hot to the point of way to hot to touch. If I had been away from the cooler for a significant amount of time it may have gotten to the plastic melting / fire stage.As far as operation when it was working, 1-2 items close to cold air output would be nice and cold, rest of items in cooler are cool not cold. Also very ambient temperature dependent... EG: If you leave it on in winter < 40 Degrees your items will most likely freeze... in summer 3-4 hours to cool down a couple of items.For Truck drivers the trick is to place the cooler where an A/C vent can blow on the cooler, works really great then.Overall, cooler worked fine for my needs of cool drinks on the road, the short life span for the price however is a huge disappointment."
4,Koolatron cooler,The cooler is perfect for my profession as a truck driver. It holds my food items at a cool temperature.
2,If They had Only Proofread I'd Give it 4 Stars!,"I think this *would* have been an excellent book if it had been extensively proofread. However, it was not, and there are typos left and right. If a second edition comes out that fixes these typos and adds even modestly to the content, I would HIGHLY reccomend it, but as it stands, there are just too many mistakes. I disagree with the reviewer who said that Chow gets ""hung up"" on the mathematics though. I think he does an excellent job with the mathematics, as linear algebra and calculus are truly the only prereqs. but he gets you thinking in a more mathematically sophisticated manner that is essential for anyone who wants to be able to read higher level physics/math texts. Please Mr. Chow, make a 2nd Edition!"
2,Disappointing.,"There's a mistake on almost every page! (Probably typeset by Mr. McGoo.) If it wasn't for all the mistakes, this book would be very promising. The chapter on relativity is real bad though, so be careful. Also, it's very obvious that Dr. Chow copied many sections from Marion and Thornton almost verbatim. The chapter on Lagrange's method needs some improvement, especially on its coverage of the calculus of variations and Hamilton's principle. Hopefully, Dr. Chow will significantly improve the second edition. Wait until then"
3,Smaller than I thought; arrived late,"I bought this specifically for a trip I was taking to the UK. I paid for the express delivery, and it still did not arrive in time, so I could not use it, and wound up buying another travel purse on the way to the airport.When I got home, this purse had arrived, and I was shocked to see how small it was. In hindsight, it wouldn't have been a good fit for my needs on my trip, so I was glad to have the other bag instead. I must have misread the dimensions of the bag in the product description. That being said, the bag is good quality, and the red is a really nice color. It is cute, just not practical for the type of traveling that I do. That was my fault for not reading closely enough about the size of the bag. However, it was the company's fault that they did not deliver the bag in time, when I paid for the express delivery.To sum up: I give the bag 4 stars, and the delivery 2 stars, leading me to the 3 star average."
4,Functional but not the right color,"I love the purse - it's the perfect size for travel, is soft and comfy. The zipper fobs are cute and easy to get to, and the strap seems sturdy. However, I ordered ""Baby Blue"" and what I received was definitely teal - much too dark to be Baby Blue. The strap was also a different color blue that didn't really match the color of the leather. I figured that's to be expected if it's hand-dyed leather. A small quibble, given the functionality of the purse. I'd recommend it."
1,Bad,"They say you get what you pay for, in this case it was very true, this item by no means can honestly be referred to as a purse of any kind it barely does justice as a wallet. Most of the items I've purchased online have been more than what I expected as to good quality for a fair price & in most cases I've gotten better quality for a better price."
5,Our most-used cookbook,"Though there are some weird recipes in here (jalapeno macaroni and cheese!), the pasta dishes especially deliver on the promise: really flavorful, really fast. The author does not shy from capers, anchovies, cayenne pepper, fresh cilantro, and other high-taste ingredients."
2,Spot n Line pen,"After using it, I realized that the craft paints I buy in the craft stores are the same or better than this product. The craft paints are used for designs on clothing and they dried harder and better than this pen paint. This pen paint actually flattens a bit after drying and the puffy paint doesn't. Plus puffy paint comes in any number of colors."
2,Not one of the best,"I first read this book in the '70's while still a teenager. Though it fascinated me (astral projection was new to me) it was, quite honestly, extremely difficult to practice. First, let me say that there may be some folks who have a knack for Baker's techniques, which is all fine and dandy, but I'm not one of them.In essence Baker suggests becoming lucid while dreaming, which in itself is no easy task, then projecting the consciousness to some desired location. The problem is that I (and probably many here who've tried it) always wake up shortly after becoming lucid, which forestalls any further attempts for the time being. After trying Baker's techniques on numerous occassions, and always with the same results, I gave up.All in all, an interesting book nonetheless, but certainly not one of the best."
2,Book for beginner,"Althought Baker was an expert occultist, this book didn't give reader a wide and clear explanation about astral projection. There is 5 techniques for 5 stage of astral projection. The problem is this book purely a 'how to' manual book. You won't get information what is astral plane look like, what will you feel and hear before separation from your physical body and how to deal with negative astral entities. If you just want to travel out of body, this book is enough for you. If you want more, get another books that can guide you.(Dalam buku ini anda akan temukan 5 teknik untuk 5 tahap proyeksi astral/ raga sukma / ngraga sukma. Masalahnya, buku ini murni buku petunjuk bagaimana melakukannya. Anda tidak akan menemukan tentang bagaimana alam gaib, apa yang akan anda alami sebelum pemisahan dari badan fisik dan bagaimana mengatasi gangguan makhluk gaib lain. Jika anda hanya ingin sekedar raga sukma saja, buku ini cukup. Jika ingin lebih, cari buku yang lain)"
3,ok,"If you get this book, the information in other books and the web about astral projection will be pennies compaired to this. This book may be small, but it's not a total rip"
1,Not Very Good,"I love Bette Davis, but this is one of her very first movies and she has only a small part. Plus the film is scratchy like an old timey film. I wouldn't bother unless you're a die-hard fan."
2,Two segments from the TV series-,"This is not as well thought out as the other YZ videos that I own. I did not find the first section at all relaxing. It included many fairly strenuous standing postures. The only ""stress release"" in this part was the instructor's mentioning that you learn to release stress through your breath. That is fine in the morning, but not before bed. There was a 2-3 min relaxation at the end, then the second half started. The second half is much more relaxing than the first, but still not up to their usual standards. If you want a nice relaxing video, there are many possibilities- The Kripalu Gentle is very nice, and has 2 30 min sections. You can buy YZ Conditioning and Stress Release, and only do 20 min of it. Or try a short Living Arts tape(PM Yoga comes to mind)."
3,A good beginning relaxing Yoga workout,"I bought Crunch's Perfect Yoga DVD to experiment with a different workout, and was HOOKED! I purchased Yoga Zone's Evening Stress Release in a fit of wanting to have all the yoga videos and I have to say, I prefered Crunch's. But this is a good beginning workout and it does have different moves than Crunch. I need variety or I will quit doing the workout (it's really not a workout, though)! There are two segments that are supposedly 20 minutes each. But I fast forward through the visualization relaxation technique at the end of the first section and continue moving with the second session, so this is only a half hour of actual Yoga. I think it is good for flexibility and relaxation in a decent amount of time. I like to do this workout right before massaging my feet with lavender peppermint cream, then reading for a half an hour before bed. The perfect hour relaxer! I'm asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow!"
1,this video is terrible,"DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO!! I just bought this dvd at Border's over the weekend for 9.99. It is not worth 2 cents. See the nice peaceful girl on the cover? The instructor in the video is a devilish looking man with a red ""goatee"" who looks like creepy Tom Green from MTV. He never uses yoga terms, he uses postures that are not for stress relief, and he could possibly be damaging to a person's body. And the woman with him seems to be lobotomized. This dvd is awful and I am returning it very soon. Please don't order it--you will be SORRY!"
5,Home Backyard Wonder,Bought these to make our own backyard putting green. Worked great and all the kids in the neighborhood come over and play a quick round with our kids.
3,Review of Accelerated Product Development,"Well written, concise, but a little confusing. Maybe it's just me but a lot of the visuals complicate matters instead of help understanding."
5,I love this wonderful book!!,"I love Agnes Parker, I feel like she could be my best friend!! There are so many favorite parts in this book, I don't think I could even list them all. Agnes is going through changes in her life now that she is in sixth grade, and is not sure how things are going to be with her best friend Prejean. And then the new boy comes to town with a sad, sad secret, and Agnes is the perfect person to help him through the hard times. I also love the bully Neidermeyer, even though she can be so mean, I've known girls just like her, and the competition that happens between her and Agnes is so real, I couldn't believe how good this book is! Read it for yourself and see."
4,Agnes Parker...Girl in Progress,"Book was purchased for my grandaughter for Christmas, so the book has not been read yet...however, great price and customer service, thank you!"
5,Best roaster out there,"This roaster is perfect for everything. It fits a tenderloin, or a turkey, or two whole chickens. The oval shape is also great - no tough corners to clean. I also like that this roaster doesn't come with a rack; there is no need to cook a turkey on a rack. This pan can also be used on the stovetop, which is perfect for searing, etc. I always get a big ""wow!"" when we have guests and I pull this out of the oven!!"
3,Not so hot.,"This event features plenty of boredom. Plenty of two fighters laying on the mat in the exact same position for long periods of time. It also features what I always thought to be the biggest UFC blunder, the 'superfight'. If you are a hardcore collector then this will be a good DVD to pick up for your collection. If not, I would strongly recommend saving your money for UFC 6."
2,Terrible Event,"I've seen almost all of the UFC events, and I assure you that this is one of the worst ones available on DVD. The superfight between Ken Shamrock and Royce Gracie did not live up to the hype even in the slightest, and it was mostly just Ken Shamrock laying on top of Royce Gracie in a defensive Jiu-Jitsu posture for about 35 minutes. It was one of the top 3 worst fights I've personally been exposed to in the UFC, and the other fights(with the exception of just a couple) in this event were not that impressive at all. And the main event consisting of Dan Severn winning the championship, also, was not that impressive at all.I do not recommend spending even 4-5 dollars on this product, and I recommend purchasing UFC 6 instead, which is the debut of ""Tank"" Abbot."
4,Shares the perspective of a Christian battered woman.,"The writer shares her experience of being a battered woman and seeking to end her abuse, protect her children, keep her faith, and hold her husband accountable for his actions. I was impressed with her courage and his honesty (her husband shares his story too). Clergy or those involved in church ministry may find this book helpful in understanding what victims in their congregations may be dealing with at home, and how their responses may either encourage her or make her struggle for safety and a healthy marriage harder."
4,This is an excellent book. It is pretty acurate.,The layout of this book is wonderful. I love mythology and I found a lot of information in this book. I highly recommend it to all mythology buffs out there!
5,Very interesting and readable book,"This is an engagingly written and interesting book. I read it in three sittings. If you want to know about new religions. How do they start? Who started them? Why do they continue? What do they believe in and why they generate so much interest in the media - then this is the book for you. You don't have to be an academic or have any experience in religious studies to find this book fascinating. I am a chemist and read this book as a change of pace from my normal murder, blood and gore thrillers, and enjoyed every page."
3,cute little story...but...?,"I got this book in hopes it would be a helpful tool in learning Vietnamese. The text is simple enough, but my Vietnamese friend kept giving me alternative translations because she was skeptical that it was the best translation into that language. Not that I personally could judge... However, I am looking for more of these parallel texts between Vietnamese and English and wish there were more..."
4,interesting book,My grandmother had this book and i grew up looking at it. I was always fascinated by it. Very interesting picture section and the stories are true oddities.
5,SIMPLY BRILLIANT!!,"What a fun, witty, and brilliant book for kids! It is also a great gift idea for adults. The author has real creativity! My family loved every page of this book. You go girl... (Review by: A. Henry, Vero Beach, FL"
5,wonderful,Unbeknownst to me I read the two books after this one first. I loved them tremendously. I haven't read this one yet but can say for sure it will be great.
3,"Too much of one, not enough of the other","This book had a bit of a split personality. On the one hand, it was a detailed work of historical fiction. On the other, it was a sometimes raunchy romance novel.It worked more as historical fiction, which made the occassional descriptive sex scenes seem way out of place.The relationship between Niall and Emmeline was not at all romantic. I don't think I have ever read a romance novel featuring a sexually active couple where not one word of affection passes between them until the last few pages of the book, as was the case here.The interactions betweem the hero and heroine seemed wooden. There is no tension. Their ""matings"" seem cold and impersonal.Was this an early effort by this writer? If so, I would like to give some of her later work a try. This story had a lot of potential, but it just seemed to fall short."
2,And this is a romantic tale?,"I was quite happy with the first few chapters of the story and found the 2 main characters appealing. It was only when the 2 main characters met again that I was turned off by their response to each other. Maybe that's the way people really acted - i.e. treating women as chattel and with physical violence (and I do know it still happens now) but I don't particularly want to read that the ""Hero"" does that to the ""Heroine"". They both didn't seem to have any feelings for each other aside from enmity and betrayal that I was surprised that they ended up ""loving"" each other. I think it was more of a case of ""I might as well make the best of the situation as I am stuck in this"". So, this wasn't an enjoyable read for me nor was it a romantic tale."
3,HIgh and Dry in Canada,I liked this documentary but it peaks early and leaves the viewer high and dry at the end... Great things happen and then seemingly they all go away by the end of this dvd... I would like a follow-up section to updatepeople on the different topics that are being addressed.
4,I Need an Easy Friend,"I have no idea what it is like for a up and comer in the porn industry, but I imagine it would be a lot like this story...assuming you're half as beautiful as Ashley Hinshaw. The kind of beauty that makes it painful to watch her be with someone else allowing the viewer to empathize with those who are hung out to dry.The acting is good and so is the story. For a movie with these actors I was surprised (pleasantly) at how far they were willing to go with the sexual content. I do hope you check this movie out, I do."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I found the story somewhat unbelievable. I realize the job market is bad, but for a young girl to just ""give up"" and join the porn industry seems a bit contrived. The young girl didn't even TRY and look for a job. It would've been more believable if she chose a career in the porn industry as a last resort. Also, the gay and lesbian scenes seemed to have been forced into the story as well...to make the movie more controversial. In other words, it didn't seem very realistic."
2,Needs a good edit,The movie had no real sense of direction and at least 10 min could have been edited out. Several parts were just thrown in randomly without any connection to anything else in the movie. I really wanted to like the movie but you never really figured out any driving motivation for main character in her progression into porn. I kept waiting for something but then it was over and I was left wondering what happened to the time.
2,about cherry,did not enjoy this movie. it was not what i expected it to be. maybe next time i will ask for information about it.
1,movie About Cherry,Didn't get a chance to bring it up and did not have time to watch. so thank u I might have to purchace it.
3,YAWN!!! Is it over yet????,"I bought this video after reading an article about yoga. As a beginner, this video was just too boring for me. Instead, I highly recommend Bryan Kest Power Yoga Box Set."
2,Yoga Basics from Yoga Zone,"You will need to know quite a bit about warming up your own body to do this without straining. They do not give you enough restorative poses. As a result I would not recommend this tape for beginners. Even if you are intermediate in your practice, you better be able to do a warm up before this tape. For a much more well-rounded routine, I recommend Total Yoga with Tracey Rich and Ganga White."
3,Brilliant performance,"I bought this cd only for the Concerto in D Minor. I fell in love with this concerto years ago. The first and third movements are some of the most thriling works of music I have ever heard. I always wondered if old master Bach wote this piece to show off a bit! I have a small collection of recordings of this piece. Gould's is the best in terms of performance. His execution is remarkable. However, I must admit that the recording is terrible. And for that I can only give this recording three stars. Hopefully, someone will remaster it and release a proper version."
2,"Simple, basic self hypnosis",This book teaches basic self-hypnosis techniques. The book even suggests recording certain phrases to replay back to yourself. It would be better if they provided at 10 CD in the back of the book.I was very disappointed with this book.
3,Expected More,"Waited in anticipation for over 4 month for this book to come out. Cannot say that I was greatly disappointed but I expected more on such a great product. Commerce Server 2000 has great features and capabilities but these were only touched on lightly in this book. The Campaign Management, Analysis System, Profiler, etc could use a entire book on each subject. This book just skims the surface. The best reference material on Commerce Server 2000 can be found in the documentation that comes with the product."
3,"The book is good, but there are many little errs and mista","normally, the book should be rated with maximum stars, because it is the the one and only book which steps in detail into the commerce server 2000 dungeons. BUT, the codes and files downloadable from wrox site are full of errors and missing files. so, it is difficult to follow the authors in their expearince. also, you see from chapter to chapter there are different writes, having CS2K setups/retail installation. so, steping over the chapters, you have to take a look on your up to this retail solution done previously. also, some errors in the code samples inside the book (which are not part of the download) have some mistakes. but, at least. i think it is a good entry point for CS2K developer..."
2,At first glance this book seems to be a lamens' saviour.,"After going through the steps in this book, you quickly find that this book is just an overview of topics available to the Commerce Server 2000 administrator. There's not enough detail about any one of the subjects to learn how to customize your e-commerce solution."
2,Sloppy,I am only on Chapter 2 and have found at least 5 typographical errors in the text AND the code listings. It is real frustrating to spend so much time trying to understand a topic only to realize that what really was preventing you from understanding was the bugs in the code. You would think that maybe the book is also trying to teach debugging. If Wrox keeps coming out with books that are so poorly edited I will have to look elsewhere for my needs.
4,Would make a great movie!,"A sad story about problems caused by misconceptions concerning angels and spirits. Although the author is not a very good writer, the story is spellbinding and would make a great movie."
2,mostly a crock,"mostly factual as to actual events of these horrid crimes. That is until the author starts trying to convince the reader that these women were actually deceived by angels. Those of you who choose this book for interest in the crimes themselves, will not be pleased. There is also a lot to this story left out by the author. He seemed to base his entire book on some fact, and mainly what the convicted criminals told him. Having some knowledge of these women and their crimes, I was very displeased with the direction of the book."
3,watch 9761 invicta,"the watch i received is battery powered ,unlike your description that states that it is not a battery powered watch,which is wrong and i am very upset."
2,Aargh!,"While the ideas in the book are certainly good ones, the true basis of a woodworking book is the instructions, measurements, and plans. I started the Adirondack sofa and found that the hardware list did not match up with the instructions or what was actually needed. In addition, the picture of the sofa does not match their instructions...which can be very confusing if this is the first one you've tried. In my opinion, these guys had good ideas but did a poor job of proofreading their work. They really need to fix things and put out an updated addition."
2,Do you like Sword and Sorcery?,"Welcome to a distant world. A world of exciting battles, exotic women, and evil wizards. It's a world of mystical secrets, magical happenings and extraordinary entertainment. David Carradine is Kain, the last survivor of a mighty warrior tribe. Once an exalted warrior-priest, Kain now wanders the planet Ura as a mercenary sword-for-hire. In the small village of Yam-A-Tar, he finds more than a simple village war; he finds two mighty opponents, an oppressed people and the piercing, haunting eyes of a stunningly beautiful sorceress (Socas). Kain becomes embroiled in the treachery and battles, the mighty wizardry and rampant debauchery.Actually this film is a copycat version both FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and YOJIMBO transplanted story of a lone fighter playing both ends against the middle to a mystical kingdom on a planet circling two suns. Lovely leading lady Socas plays the entire film topless.The bottom line is this. If you like Sword and Sorcery you should like this movie..."
3,I actually love this film,"Like many, I first saw his C (can't really give it a B) movie on VHS in the mid-80's. This is one of those flicks that you can honestly say is so bad, it's actually good. I was fortunately enough to get a copy on DVD before it became out of print. Never would have thought this flick would ever become a ""collector's item"". Anyway, Maria Socas is obviously the highlight of this movie. I've yet to see any actress outside of a porn flick that bore her breasts as many times as Socas did in this movie. In fact, I can't remember any scenes in which she covered up. LOL! This is a classic."
2,The Warrior and the Sorceress,"You'd have to call this ""Yojimbo"" meets ""Kung Fu."" Essentially a sword-and-sorcery remake of ""Yojimbo/A Fistfull of Dollars"" starring David Carradine, TWATS is remarkable faithful to its source material considering how many goofy in-jokes and hokey special effects it contains (the grizzled wandering swordsman played by Carradine is named Cain, for example). You probably need to be drunk or (heaven forbid) high to fully appreciate this film; but it has its moments of goofy fun, and its a must for completests who need to have every remake of ""Yojimbo."""
1,TRASH,"This film is not rated, and if given the task to do so, I would rate it STUPID! The plot is non-existent. The dialog is STUPID! The action is STUPID! The entire scene of the drowning nude with the pubic beard is entirely irrelevant. It is degrading to Mr. Carradine's acting abilities to have played the lead in such a piece of trash. He was probably hired because his name/fame would draw attention to the film. If you are looking for something equal to Kung Fu, this is NOT it. Save your money. Breasts and pubic hair do NOT constitute a movie! I had the dvd less than two hours and have already dropped it at a thrift shop. This film is a piece of worthless junk."
2,not as advertised,This silverware is not 18\10 as advertised. it is very pretty. but it is 18\0. This is false advertisement.
3,False Advertising - Product Not as Described,"Unfortunately, I purchased this item because it was advertised as 18/10, which is the finest quality from Oneida. It is actually 18/0 which is defined by Oneida as a good value, but not their premium product. Do not purchase if the 18/10 factor is important to you. Otherwise, it is a very pretty set, with large, heavy individual pieces."
3,"Pictures don't reveal how big this set is, knife handle is huge!","I bought this set based on the pattern and similar sets I had seen in stores, when it arrived I at first thought I had been shipped the wrong set! All of the pieces were much bigger than I anticipated. Another reviewer said the set was ""heavyweight"", but they didn't say how big the set is, I'm telling you all the items in the set are bigger than you would think, the knife handle is probably an inch and a half wide at its widest point, too big for my hands.I sent the set back, this is the second set I had bought from Amazon and returned, both for the same reason, both were much bigger than depicted on their website. I suggest that unless you are very familiar with a particular company or a particular pattern from a company, don't buy online without first checking it out at a store or at a family/friends house."
3,"Kids Love It, But...","My kids love playing with this table. That is part of my concern. To change games from foosball to pool, air hockey or ping pong, you have to take the top section off. This is very heavy and requires to adults. My kids tried to take it off, and since the wood framing is particleboard, they damaged the corners. I would have thought that it would have been made of solid wood. If it gets alot of use, I'm not sure how long it's going to hold up. Basically, I'm happy that the kids love it, but disappointed in the quality of construction."
3,"Great game table, Low in durability","After assembling the table is great, but I had to put a lot of glue, which is never mentioned in the manual, to make it stronger. Some of the parts came broken and I had to rebuild them. The design of the legs is really flimsy, the glue I added makes it stronger, but I would prefer the table to be stronger by design.The table is made from particle board so I suppose it won't last long.But game play is very good. The air hockey works great and the foosball is very good."
3,NOT EXACTLY BURNIN' DOWN THE HOUSE,"Being a long time Etta James fan, I leaped upon this DVD when it was first released to own an actual live concert of the legendary artist. It was not what I expected. Burnin' down the house this ain't! I found a lot of the songs offered were mediocre at best. Gone were the classic growls that this awesome lady usually delivers. Being in her 60's I guess has stifled some of her voice, I dunno, but this is bland. She sits the entire program and at the outset I thought this is gonna make me sorry I invested in this DVD. For all her ups and downs, I feel this is a poor initial gift to her many fans. This concert is a yawner!"
3,Etta James Finale,"Etta's singing was adequate. However, her attempt to make her performance ""sexy"" by her language & gestures did not fit. She has the voice & good background musicians, but this live performance was less impressive than her earlier years. Too much time trying to talk & gesture ""sexy"", detracted from her otherwise talented ""soul""."
3,Etta,"This was purchased for a friends birthday, the review i got from them was it was pretty good, but they exspected a little more. (from her)"
5,bonkers is the best!!!,"bonkers is THE definitive happy hardcore compilation series. this is an earlier one full of classic oldskool hardcore. if you like fast, cheezy, passionate, psychedelic beatz, you'll love bonkers 4."
1,Knife blades all look dirty.,Bought 2 sets and I do wash in the dishwasher. Knife blades look dirty. No matter what I try -- they look dirty. Changed soaps. Embarrassed to use them! Contacting Oneida to see if they will honor the lifetime guarantee. Will post the response.
3,Didn't receive,"I ordered this product, and it never came. However, the company did contact me and tell me that they were out of stock and promptly refunded me. I chose not to re-buy in case this were to happen again."
1,Charge you for stuff they don't have,I am shocked and dismayed by the blatant disregard for their customers by Amazon to even allow this kind of vendor on their site!I was charged for 10 bags PLUS Shipping for 10 bags and then 5 bags shipped.These are for Christmas gifts and it is almost impossible to communicate with this vendor so I am out $127 for NOTHING as I cannot give the 5 bags to 10 people!Rest assured that I will not rest until everyone knows about this theft!
2,"Nice design, no backing","I loved the design on this tablecloth. However, because there is no felt backing, it slips and slides over the table."
2,Interesting theories of past unresolved deaths,"One must appreciate that Dr. Noguchi was at the forefront of forensic medicine around the time of this book, and in that respect he deserves accolades. In this, his second ""coroner"" book he assumes a consultant viewpoint of some famous and mysterious, unresolved deaths. Some of the more interesting ones are Elvis, the family members of Jeffrey McDonald, and even Jack the Ripper. It is interesting to see his viewpoints, although the novel at this point in time is becoming dated. Technology is rapidly evolving and resolving more and more questionable deaths. We have Mr. Noguchi to thank for promoting the field."
5,Fascinating reading!,"This book is must for those interested in understanding how totalitarian regimes usurp and consolidate their power. Taking example of environment close to author's heart - an university - the book goes through gruelsome details about how communism as a political force took over once prosperous, religious and democratic society and turned it into an obedient satellite of Soviet Empire. The characters and events are portraied in strict historical terms, however, the reader will not fail to the drawn into the story of incredible proportions and drama. I would highly recommend this book to students of Eastern European history, but also history and philosophy in general."
5,It's about our heritage,"No matter what your ethnic background, we all as Americans have an obligation to our country. This obligation may lead you to become a doctor, teacher, or even a solider.To have this love and loyalty,you must have a sense of history. This book shows how we have lost touch with our history in the last fifty years.It shows how we have lost sight of our moral responsibilities. There are many history books on the market but most do not connect history with real life events. Mr. Biesada shows history in a different light, in a way that everyone can understand and relate to. His unique writing style is very confortable and modern. The book in written to be straight forward but it is also very humorous. He helps you look at life throught his point of view. From love to politics he explains and examines our society. I have bought all my family members this book for Christmas and I would love to see it in our public schools."
2,The series has gone in the toilet.,"The last three books were very good, even with the transpop characters thrown in. The first half of this one is interesting in depicting academy life. The bizarre gay references come out of 'left' field and don't belong. Furthermore I finally gave up a little past halfway because it completely dissolves itself into 'trannie' culture in New York and is just too unbelieveably stupid to have kept my interest. The absolute worst in any of these books is when Seafort tries to talk like a tranny or understand them, it's just total crap."
3,"Belay that whining, Seafort!","I must say that by this point in the Seafort Saga, Seafort's whining is just getting to be too much. Admitedly, he has reason to whine - he is the most improbably unlucky man in the universe. Everything that can be dumped onto him is, and by the time I was done this volume, I had had quite enough. Once again Seafort behaves badly to save the day - for the third book in a row (though his ""damning"" behaviour in Challeger's Hope is really just a problem in his own head, IMHO).So while this one was not a favorite, the series is still worth sticking with - Voices of Hope is very good, and has far less of Nick Seafort in it, and none of his guilt-ridden internal dialogue."
3,"Self-absorbed, Very Tiresome Hero","Totally agree with some reviewers relative to the hero's whining and mental self-flaggelation; the repetitious issues were really tiring; the man knows he has some severe emotional problems but he just goes forward with same ole same ole. I finished the book, ignoring the issues that were bothersome, but the last 50 or so pages kept my eyes glued to the book, but no spoilers here. I was absolutely astounded that the author was so liberal with the use of corporal punishment, particularly with the use of caning in the Air Force Academy; can't believe that an extreme attitude about ""spare the rod & spoil the child"" would be resurrrected in an advanced, sane world."
5,Reality,"Not your typical SF hero. His angst at his status as hero reminds me of my Silver Star winner relative. Thought it was just luck and never understood why people would do anything different or think it was special. Seafort is developed as a real warrior not a ""John Wayne"" stereotype. His problem of how to treat cadets is a classic problem. Like the Honor series of Weber it based on a 19th century version of Navy regs moved into space. The most difficult to believe aspect was that corporal punishment would still be in use in space. Other then this complaint I enjoyed the authors characters very much, sorry I hadn't run into this series sooner and have ordered the rest of the ""saga"""
2,Wish I could have picked my own text book.....,"I was required to use this book as my text for VB at a local college. The author's thorough knowledge of her subject shows through, but she needs to work on her teaching technique. I always felt like I had to read three pages for what could have been summed up and made less confusing in one page. I also think that the index left much to be desired -- most text books end up being used for reference, and what good is a reference with a lousy index? It was like having a jigsaw puzzle with many nice pieces, but no big picture to guide you in putting it all together. I'm planning on buying a VB book of my own choice this time -- if you have a choice I'd suggest the same."
2,For absolute beginners only !,"As an intermediate programmer, i was very disappointed with the book. It covered only issues relevant for beginners and used approach suited for beginners (i.e. very detailed). The title should have been like introduction, for beginners, etc. to prevent us more advanced from buying the book."
5,"I've read a lot of VB books, but this one is the best so far","Programming With Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 by Diane Zak is probably one of the best beginner programming books I have come across. It is easy to read and follow, which for beginners is an important feature to take into consideration. A nice extension to the book is that the sample code for the tutorials are available via download from their web site so if you seem to get stuck in an area more than likely they have some form or another of that code working so you can at least see what it is supposed to do. The only group I would not recommend this book to is intermediate/advanced VB programmers because the book does move a little slower than others, and it can become repetitious by time you get to the 3rd lesson of a tutorial. After nearly completing this book I can see why my University would select this book."
4,Excellent for beginner. Good for those with some experience.,"I am using this book as part of a college course. Although the explainations are a bit wordy, it is overall a very good book. It clearly defines items such as Object Oriented Programming and all of its components, and many other topics. If you are a beginner you will read most of it carefully. If you have some prior experience with programming, but not visual basic, you will probably skim past parts of it. I liked the book."
1,The worst book ever written on the subject of Visual Basic!,"This book is the worst book ever written on the subject of Visual Basic. It is very verbose and confusing to the students. A better choice would be,Visual Basic6, by Shelly & Cashman."
4,Nice Bargain Price for a Good Sleeping Bag,"The Coleman Oversized Sleeping Bag is big, warm and comfortable. Plenty of room inside if you move while you sleep. This purchase was for my son who is a Boy Scout and he has used the bag 3 times while camping during this past winter. He likes to use it when his friends sleep over and always gives up his bed so he can sleep in the bag. He says it's that comfortable!The bag is too large and heavy to use if you are backpacking, but it is the best I have seen for a camping trip. I highly recommend this bag for kids and adults who need a larger sleeping bag."
5,Coleman Magellan 10-Degree Sleeping Bag,"This is the best sleeping bag that I have ever owned. I own a Coleman Peak-1 that I've had for 15 years. It is a traditional ""mummy"" sleeping bag that is very effective down to 0 degrees. But it limits your ability to move your legs and feet. This bag doesn't and it definitely keeps you warm with the sleeping hood. With the larger bag, it allows more movement and you stay relaxed. I would defintely recomend it to anyone shopping for a new bag."
3,Ok,"This is some older footage of gwar, so the stage show isn't quite as good as it is now. The sound quality is descent. In all, if you're a gwar fan you'll dig this video."
5,Magical Wagner Wool Dual Roller,"This product is hardly available in stores. This is a ""magic"" roller that can create beautiful spaces in your home. It is easy and fun to use. If you would like a room or a wall in your house to stand out, using this roller will surely give you a result."
5,A Fun Film,"We purchased this movie for our kids, because it's a family oriented film. Our kids love it. While it's intense in spots, it doesn't overwhelm the little one.We liked it."
1,Don't waste your time,"This movie for lack of better words, sucked. I could not make it through it and sent it off to the Goodwill the next day. Major let-down with back acting and poor filming."
1,Awful DVD,I don't know if I've ever seen worse acting than this DVD. We switch back and forth to dry footage to deep green grass where the firefighters are setting up fire lines. The firefighters have dirty faces and dirt on the front of their neckline but otherwise are clean as can be. The best acting was done by the animals. I don't know how these actors find their way into a DVD when there are so many talented souls unemployed.
1,Misleading label... really only 10mg of Lutein,"This product has only 10 mg of ordinary lutein per pill. The 20 mg of ""lutein esters"" is not equivalent to the 20 mg pills you can get at Walmart or other places.However, the pills came on time and were good for vision, even at a lower dose than I expected."
5,Good story,"I don't know why it is, but film makers around the world seem so much better at capturing the human psyche on film the those in the US. This up close examination of how peoples lives can be intertwined and the consequences good or bad makes for an excellent movie. This scenario could play out anywhere in any big city anywhere in the world. The acting was so good, the various situations so believable. Starts to make you wonder...is this happening somewhere in my life? Highly recommended!"
4,Great Choice,"In a nutt shell - if you are into Indie Films this one is one of them you see watch. Great story, has a beginning, middle and ending. If you are not shy about nudity/sexuality at its best then this is the film for you.I added it to my collection"
1,GPX is JUNK,I got a GPX CD player for Christmas and it broke the 2nd time I used. TARGET wouldn't exchange it becuase I didn't have a receipt (It was a dang Christmas present!) I called GPX and they wanted me to ship the player back to them which cost $10 and mail them a check for $15. So it would cost me another $25 to replace it. GPX makes lousy products. You would have to be a FOOL to buy this product.
3,Slow Shipping,The book is in good condition; the description I read online before purchasing was very accurate. The only thing that was stressful was the speed of shipping. It took nearly four weeks to get the book- unacceptable in my opinion.
4,Replace your TUMS.,"TUMS are just plain unhealthy and loaded with aluminum. This is a healthy alternative and works great. No side effects. Papaya Enzyme gives your body what it REALLY needs to digest food, ENZYMES."
2,Didn't help,"Taste good, but didn't help with gas. I have found that Yakult once a day and Schiff ""Digestive Advantage"" works the best for me."
4,Work well,"I like these, they make me feel better after eating and have helped with my reflux. They don't taste as good as other brands I have had though, they taste a little strange, but not horrible. For the price, I like them a lot."
2,It does not work for me.,This product has little effect on me. It may work for other people. So I will not buy it again. Actually I find many similar products in my local grocery store that work as wonders.
4,Formulaic but fine,"Of course the Combat! formula is readily apparent:- Squadron newbies meet with certain demise- Death is a neat and tidy thing- Krauts always fall prey to being flanked and a couple of grenadesBut the visuals are very fine in these color episodes (especially with a good upsampler) and the characters are firmly established. Morrow in particular nails the Saunders persona: perceptive, taciturn and strong. He is very convincing. Others have commented on the program music: very dramatic and memorable.Otherwise, I kept wishing for a break in the formula. Even the Saunders-on-leave in England episode was largely predictable, except for those last, most powerful scenes. But a compelling and involving series, nevertheless."
4,To the guy above or anyone....,"Great show finally in color. What does ""time compressed"" version mean??????"
4,Nice Look,"Shoe is casual but with a little more style. The leather on these looked a little worn, I have shoe in brown and red also and they were in better condition. Shoe is true to size and just slightly narrower than I expected. I liked style so much bought in 3 colors."
4,great deal and great quality,"The shoes are comfy and of great quality. I wasn't sure if I liked the buckle, but decided to risk it b/c of the great price. The buckle is a nice accent and overall I'm am very happy with the shoes."
5,The Best of the Best,"When I first picked up this book, I thought it'd be boring. My parents have fed me thousands of books that's about peer pressure, sex, and other things that affects teens. I hated those books since they weren't anything I could relate to and were written by like fifty years old adults! Anyway, I was sitting at lunch thought I should start it since I'd have to start eventually when one of my friends came over and she sat down beside me and said, ""Oh, that book! I love it so much! Let me show you this really sad story..."" she flipped to a page and I started reading. I suddenly realized that it was actually a good story. ""And here's this really funny one..."" She flipped the pages again. She showed me page after page after page and by dinner time, I had read the entire book cover to cover two times. I love it and would recommend it not only to teens, but adults as well."
5,Best book for teenagers I've ever read!,"I definitley found this book interesting. When I received it, I was having a lot of problems, and it helped me through mine, and made me relize how other people view and go through life, (made fun of, abuse, hadicaptism, etc.) I think this book was an excellent idea, my best friend and I read stories from both teenage chicken soup books and cry, so many of them some how relate with us or people we know. Both of us have gained a lot of knowledge from this book. The story that helped me the most was Losing The Us, I was going through the exact thing when I received the book, (now one year later I havn't moved on)Thank you so much keep coming out with these books!"
4,This book was great!,"This book was one every teenager should read, it is about life as a teen & what happens. Everyone has a different point of view, but that was mine. I really liked the book & I would read it again anyday, of course, that's if my friend lets me borrow it..."
1,This book will insult any smart teen's intelligence!,"Instead of inspiring me, this book made me gag. I didn't relate to any of the simple, overly cutesy, cliched, and sentimental stories. The whole attitude of the book was trite and condescending. Also, the christian message was overpowering. How about some stories abot kids from different religious/cultural backrounds, who aren't the same middle-class, mid-western, white christians? I definately don't reccomend wasting your money on this book."
2,Almost Disappointing,"I picked up this book at a time in my life when I had a lot of complicated problems, and was hoping that by reading the stories of others' experiences, there would be some sort of comfort to be found. However, most of the stories in here are pretty cliched, uninspiring and sappy descriptions of problems that came nowhere near to the depth I was needing and hoping for. For teenagers who are dealing with tough issues, this book can make you feel more alone because it seems that no one who contributed to the book went through anything particularly serious. With a few exceptions, this book remains a frivolous and meaningless description of Brady Bunch problems in a serious world."
4,This book was not as inspirational as I hoped it would be,"I thought the stories were touching but I wasn't really moved by them. The book doesn't drag on, but I hoped it would give insights on how to change instead of soley giving stories. This book has a good deal of publicity but the book doesn't deliver all that it promises."
4,So good,"Again, not enough is written for teenagers that is positive and not too heavy. Because there are many stories, the book can be put down at any time and resumes at some other time when the teenager may be feeling down or just needing a different perspective. Easy to read, but so much heart, so many good stories. They really do make the heart feel good.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
5,I loved the book.,I thought the book was great and had real touching stories. It was very interesting and kept me interested. I think the book is good for girls and boys!!
5,Everyone needs to read this book!,"I am 13 and I don't read many books, so when my Mom bought me this book I didn't think I would like it, but this book is WOW! It focuses on eveyday, everyone's problems. I didn't know so many people had the same problems I did! You NEED to read this book!"
5,It was a very spirtual and uplifting book,"I think this book is excellent not only for teenagers but for their parents too. This book gives teenagers hopes and stops them from making a very stupid decision like drinking and driving or drinking itself. If someone has a problem and can't find a way out, this book is the answer. It gives you numbers of places you can call or write to if you have lost a loved one to drunk driving. It was an excellent book and I would recomond it to anyone who's spirt needs an uplift."
5,I never knew what Chicken Soup could do for you,"Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul has become my friend over the past week. I feel as if it can understand my feelings, and it is always there for me. Lots of the months have been hard for, but chicken Soup has mad them easier!"
1,THIS BOOK IS SO DULL,"the first time i saw it i was like, cool a book that can ACTUALLY HELP ME U KNOW! but then i read it and it was soo damn boring! it really all sux cuz i dont wanna here some boring probs about boring peoples lives! that dont help teenagers at all! i recommend u dotn buy it! unless your one of those people who like to listen about their boring probs! well whatever! it STINKS!"
5,A great book that realy makes you think about your life!,"Man you can't get any better than this book. It teaches you so much and that you have it preaty good. All of my freinds borrowed this book from me and have read it about 3 times or more. This is one book you can read over and over. It willl make you cry,laught,and feel great about yourself. This is the only book that can help you live your life. I hope everyone able to read even a little bit of this book does and that the read it millions of times."
5,Read this!,"This book is and excellent book for teenagers. Going through this hard time you need a soul lifter. This book helps you with your problems:love, friendship, family, and much more. If you have not read this book go get now!!!!!!!"
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!,YOU WILL NEVER FIND A BOOK LIKE THIS ONE. ITS THE BEST BOO I HAVE EVER READ!!! I LEARNED MANY THINGS I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY PERSON ON THINKING OF.
5,this book helps me through my everyday life of being a teen,"This book is GREAT!! I am almost 17, and I have problems with love, family, home, and friends, and this book gives me great advice!! I love reading the stories about other teens because this helps me to see that I am not the only teen with problems. There are lots of teens with the same problems as me. Thanks a bunch! Love Roxanne from: Louisiana"
5,A great book for everyone...not just teenagers!,"I think that this book is a real inspiration, and I know that it would help anybody through there problems. I read certain personal stories from this book when I am down, and then it reminds me that I am not the only one with problems. It helps me get through my day and it makes me realize that life really isn't that bad. I hope that everyone who reads this book, feels the same way. :)"
5,amazing!,This is one of the better books I have ever read! I loved it so MUCH! It made me laugh and cry. If you're feeling down read this book! It gives you a real view on life and how much there really is to it. Please read this book and if you don't like it I feel sorry for you because this really influanced my life and the way I look at it now.
5,"This book, really told about how the person was feeling","This book really told me aoubt how the person was feeling inside.It also tuaght me about the different feelings Ihad inside of me when I first started readig this book by myself,and I'm still learing from it as I grow more and more. P.S. pease tell me how you feel abuot my comment that I worte. Love, Susanna felicity mcwilliams"
5,Very Insperational,It gives deep insites and stories of things that happen to teens as they grow up. Many of my friends have read it too. We all think it is great!
5,My Review,"I thought this book was great. I haven't finished yet because I keep on reading stories over and over. Some stories will make ya laugh and some will make ya cry, which makes it soo hard to but down."
5,Greatest book ever writen for young adults,"This book is a moving book with stories that all teenagers will beable to relate to. There are real life stories that people there age go through. The stories terach about life, love , and learning. I would say to read this if any teenager is feeling as if this is the end of everything , it will make them relize that life is a thing to be great full for . this is the best book I've ever read. Thats why I gave it the Five star rating."
3,hMmmmmmMmmmMMmmMMmm,"chicken soup for the teenage soul is definitely worth putting into your collection...and I agree with the others, its a great inspirational book, but sometimes I get the feeling that its too perfect. I mean that's not how the real teenage life is portrayed with a happy ending. Teenagers go through real problems and its not as simple as the story shows them. The one thing that INFURIATES me is that this book seems to think it is the solution to the problem but it is not. A book is just something to read. Read this book if you want, but I think its all hyped up by the media."
1,"um, euwww",this book was really boring. i think my math book is more intresting (heh). i think it's kinda disgusting that people made money for just telling about their (boring) memories. i do not recommed this peice of ****.
5,I love this book.It is so interesting.,"Every night i read a story from this book.My best story is "" A Famous Father """
5,"A fantastic book for anybody anywhere, at any time.","This is a great book. If you havene't read it yet, than you should press the button ""add to shopping cart"". This book was so great because it was so real. It's one of these books you can't put down, even though the page is so blurred with your teers. There are so many stories to choose. If your in a really bad mood you could read one of the happy stories, and be automatically cheered up. These stories give you another look at life, and at the people around you.I would suggest this book to anybody, anywhere, at anytime, no matter what situations you are in."
5,It was incredibly good!,"This book deals with many emotions that young adults have to deal with, and it deals with them truthfully. When you read these stories, your heart kind of goes out to these people while you feel a familiarity with it.It's just an incredible book that every young adult should read!"
5,It's amazing,"I really enjoy reading Chicken Soup for the soul! Is like i can relate my life to most of the stories. They are so real and emotional is like i'm leaving through the whole thing while i'm reading it. So far i've only read one, Chicken soup for the teenage soul on though stuff, but it is really good , i'm thinking of buying chicken soup for the teenage soul part 1&2. One of my favorite story is the Graduation Speech, it realley thouched me because they're people out there who kill themselves because of lack of freindship. this story was very emotional, it really did touch me."
5,This book was truly worth every penny!!,"When I got this book I just thought it was going to be something to keep me slightly awake on a bus trip I had coming up, but once I read it I realized that this book would do more than keep me awake! It made me laugh.... It made me cry... This book has a unique balance between funny, sad, and weird teenage experiences and if you haven't read it, I strongly encourage you to do so!!"
5,I love it,"I like this book because one day at school, in in com arts we read one of the poems ""Some one Should Have taught him"" Even though I am 12 that poem really told me what alchahol can do to you. Iread that poem over and over again I sware I could have cried."
5,"A Fantastic, Heartwarming book! All Teens should get it!","This Book tells everything a teenager needs to know. There are embarasssing stories they can relate to, and sad storys you pray you won't ever be able to relate to such as, suicide. When you feel down, you could pull out this book, and know that you're not the only person to feel that way. I laughed, I cried, I felt extremely close to people I don't even know. All teenagers should read it, all adults should read it. It makes a great gift! Two thumbs up!_ Kate McNamee ;MD."
4,What a Great Book!!,"Chicken Soup for the teenage soul was an outstanding book. I really enjoy reading this book, because I could relate to almost every story. This book deals with a lot of life situations teenagers go through in everyday life. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading stories they can relate to regarding life, love, relationships, and school."
5,The first book that I related too enough to cry during it.,"I got this book at 5 in the afternoon one day and by midnight I was done. All of the emotions that I feel as a teenager were written into this book and I sobbed my way through it. Don't get me wrong- It's not a sad book, but when something seems to reflect all your problems and understand that there are no easy solutioms- well, I was so relieved to be able to let myself go."
4,mmm.......mmm.......good!,This book is fantastic for teens who need advice on almost anything! It has stories on teen problems from two-week relationships to tough stuff and life changing decisions! This book really opens your eyes to a different side of the world! It shows you how it really is and tells you how to prevent yourself from having to be put in that situation! They are all true stories and proves that anything can happen to anyone! This book is also good for anyone to read no matter what your taste is in books! Chicken soup has it all! From love stories to tear jerkers to blood and gore! I would definately recommend this book to anyone who doesnt want to waste their time! It's an excellent book!
4,touching...,"this book is a very touching book. The stories are sweet as well as loveable. you can relate to it in many ways from relationship to family. These stories come from the bottom of their hearts. If you're at heartache pick up this book and read a story, you may even end up in tears. They also include some comic stripes realted to the topic which are really funny and true."
5,"This book, I LOVED IT","This book was a very good help to me. I was in depresion when I first got it and it cheered me up. Now, I'm on the 3rd teenage soul book. You must read this book. Also read the kinds of chicken soup"
5,Review from a TEEN!,"I just wanted to let everyone know that this book is so wonderful! I loved it and it touched me in so many ways. I have looked at different aspects of my life with new perspectives now. I liked this book so much that I bought the Teenage Soul II book. It's just as wonderful as the first. Buy this book for your sister, brother, niece, nephew or even yourself."
3,Chicken Soup Review,"From major league to little leaguers, from hockey stars to figure skaters, and from horseracing to mushing, the stories in this book highlight the positive and transformative nature of sports. As When you read Chicken Soup for the Sports Fans Soul, you will see sports as one of our most important and powerful teachers, one that teaches us to be humble in victory and gracious in defeat; the importance of teamwork and the value of striving. At its best, sports builds character and teaches to overcome adversity. Whether you are a professional athlete or a weekend warrior; a soccer mom of a diehard sports fan; a marathon runner or a neighborhood jogger, these stories will provide you will treasure insights into the game of life."
5,IT MADE ME CRY,THIS IS THE BEST BOOK. IT REALLY HELPED ME OUT WITH PAST AND FPRESENT PROBLEMS. I DEFINITELY RECCOMEND THIS BOOK.
5,This book meant so much to me!,"I was in 6th period one day when a friend started reading a story to me. The story told of the consequences of drinking and driving. This really hit home because I had a friend that was killed by a drunk driver. I hope that more teens read this book, and learn from it and NOT from experiance! Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul is the best book I have ever heard of and I can't wait to read the rest of it!"
5,A Must For ALL Teens Growing Up In The 90's,"This book is a MUST for all teens!I especially like the poems,""Oyster"" and ""Paintbrush"" for they're VERY true.I Can't wait for the second edition of it...This book really *lifts your spirits* and lets you know that you're not the only one out there going through *these problems* buy it...it's the best book you'll ever read.And trust me!It's not a *one time* read book,it's a *read it everyday book*"
5,Just Beautiful,"This book is just great, it helped me a lot and it made me see that there's lot of people that have the same problems as me, and I am not the only one, and that I can solve it just like that person did.. and the best of all is that all they are true stories, written by true people that had experienced in their own lifes what they are writing of..Believe me, it's really worthy to read!!"
5,Worth the bucks,I was skeptical when I read the other negative reviews but made up my mind and purchased this album anyway and I really am glad I did because it is one more grand piece in Lacrimas Collection. My favorite tracks are:Sear Me Pale SunThe NothingshipFornever(the ultimatum)
1,ouch,"i loved lacrimas' previous forays into doom metal. They had a beautiful way of decribing melancholy through music. This album has none of that. its pop-ish almost, no saddened hooks, they did an adorertwo, which is just pointless and harsh. harsh is in, wow, they made that piece of ****. anyways, the quality lacks, not the same style. the only song i found decent was the last song, and the bonus song accompanying it. so if you love this band enough to try this album out, dont be surprised if you're disappointed. adios."
5,Saved my feet,I ended up hiking more then expected on my last backpacking trip and I got a couple of blisters on my feet. The mole skin works great and save me from an extremely painful hike. Its definitely a must have.
4,Thin - but it will work,"It was inexpensive - so thought I would give it a try. In direct comparison to Dr. Scholl's moleskin- it's noticeably thinner when feeling between my fingers. Good adhesive - on par with Dr. Scholls. Not to be confused with thicker products like molefoam (also Dr. Scholl's) which is much thicker. Agree with other posts that for the money, could easily double it up, be thicker than moleskin and still save money."
4,Moleskin,"I was planning a trip and my trip-mate always has issues with shoes and friction. Sometimes causing broken skin and bleeding. This came perfectly for those occasions. great because it's in a roll, I can cut it to whatever size I want and the self-adhesive sticks without being too sticky. Great stuff and the fuzzy side doesnt rub against the shoe and causes no friction."
1,Disappointed in the the hero and in the baby angle,"I'm not a prude, but I expect that when I read about a man who is trying to decide whether or not to take his final vows to be a priest that he will struggle at least a little with giving in to his sexual desires out of wedlock. The hero, Brendan, doesn't seem to give it a thought when he makes out with the Dani, the heroine. I felt like the story was just pieced together without much developement of the issues that the characters were supposedly struggling with. I also thought there would be a bit more about the relationship of the couple with the baby, the offspring of Brendan's unwed niece, but the baby seemed to be secondary to things, and ends up getting adopted by strangers at the end of the book. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book."
4,Keeper of the Harvest,"Deals with hard decisions well, such as ""Is God calling me to the mission field?"" Book was instrumental in a difficult time, very inspirational. Humor is great, you'll want to keep reading."
5,Very nice,"The ring is beautiful, my husband loves it. It arrived in record time (even though I live in Canada) There were no hidden costs (unlike another company I have ordered from) The ring is very sturdy!! My husband works with his hands a lot and it has yet to receive a scratch. Great company, great products, great service. Purchasing is very highly recommended!!"
4,The BEST Arcade Stick available for Dreamcast.,"This is the best. No subsitutes. Even the flashy gloss alloyInteract Arcade Stick cannot compare with this one. I have found that Agetec has put a lot of effort into their creations, unlike Interact, who develops a whole load of bad quality items. If you are deciding to buy an Arcade Stick, buy this one. Even though it looks plain, it works excellently and is very, very durable. I personally like the simple, ergonomic design, but incase you doubt the quality of this fine product, ask someone who you know actually owns it. I have recommended this Stick to many, many of my friends. And not one has complained. Not one. So ignore all the rumors and the stories. This is definetely worth the money if you plan to play a lot of arcade-style fighting games, but then again, Arcade Sticks are generally multi-use. A good buy, trust me."
4,This controller is great,"If youve ever played a game like street fighter or marvel vs. capcom you know that the standard controller just doesnt cut it. The arcade stick allows faster reaction with easier combinations of buttons. The only thing this joystick lacks is full programability, which isnt so bad if youre only using this for fighting games. DO NOT however buy this controller for games that have no indication on the back that they work with the joystick. On the back of the game case there should be an icon saying that the game is joystick compatible. The reason the joystick does not work with certain games is because programers did not put in a code wich recognizes joysticks."
2,ARCADE STICK---NOT-AGETEK,We had the controller for three days and one of the wires had to be re soldered and one of the buttons keeps sticking. Would not buy this particular item again. Would try the AGETEK ARCADE STICK next time. Didn't realize I ordered the other brand when buying this item.
5,A true glimps into the mind of those who are out,"This book was so inspiring and at time overwhelming... It will make you cry with the poetic reverence, and laugh with its abunding charm.... It give great insight on comming out, and It helps you to decide when is right for you to enter into your own journey on the road to being free.. to being OUT"
4,You'll find a strory you can relate to...,If you're reading this anthology you're bound to find a story that speaks directly to you.
3,No big insights but a decent picture book.,"This book does not provide any exceptionally insights into the Gehry's thinking and the use of computer modeling is no big surprise to anyone. The best book on Gehry, that I know about, is the monograph by El Croquis (which was published before the Guggenheim's realization). That said, I visited the museum shortly after it opened (bought book there) and it's a wonderful design. Although photos are never as good as the experience of being there, if you can't afford to visit Spain, a decent picture book will show you what you missed."
5,"best images, good for researching Gehry's design process",this is a great book for students and professionals alike. It takes an indepth look at the design process and how such an abstract building is created in the real world.
3,i doubt,"Regarding Frank Gehry's Acceptance Speech, Pritzker 1989: he says: "" Our problems as architects increase in complexity as time goes on. We have difficulty with the art of city building. We are finding ways of working together, artists and architects, architects and architects, clients and architects. The dream is that each brick, each window, each wall, each road, each tree will be placed lovingly by craftsmen, client, architect, and people to create beautiful cities. Adding the extra time and the money at the beginning is essential.""and again he says: "" Architecture must solve complex problems. We must understand and use technology, we must create buildings which are safe and dry, respectful of context and neighbors, and face all the myriad of issues of social responsibility, and even please the client.""i doubt he could solve those coplex problem"
4,Very nice,This is a very nice cat poetry anthology. I also recommend The Poetical cat by Felicity Bast.
3,Penny Pinchers Passport,Good book but took one theme and expanded on it. Not sure I could do what author suggests.
1,Not worth the money,Felt it was a waste of money--not much info that most seasoned travelers don't know. I plan to donate my copy to local library for their junk-book sale. The part about flying 1st class at coach prices was laughable & utterly unrealistic.
1,... Not accurate advice,...Very unrealistic. I tried his advice and just got laughs. We travel a lot and have learned that there is only one world in travel; you get what you pay for (or use legal upgrades). The writer also tells you things you already know to be true... travel off peak is cheaper. I do not need a book to tell me this. This book is the king's new clothes
2,There are more practical ways,"I agree with most comments, it is disappointing and a let down from the expectations I had about this book. Particularly in this day and age of 5 star hotels costing $500 per night and upwards.I found it takes more than being a loyal customer to get good rates at luxury resorts."
1,Could have been said in 2 pages!,"what a waste of time and money reading this book. basically the book says that you should be flexible, travel contrary to the heavy seasons, be loyal to your airlines and hotels, be vocal but polite in your requests for upgrades and that is that. reasonable advice BUT A BOOK IT IS NOT. these items are essentially repeated over and over and over in order to reach critical book mass.you now know everything you will learn from this book so don't buy it."
1,How to waste money before you travel.,This has to qualify as one of the worst books ever written. The author wants to tell us all how successful he has been in charming travel industry employees into giving him upgrades while endlessly repeating the same stale phrases over and over and over. The book could easy have been printed on half the pages if the repetitions had been edited. Save your money and buy a drink to celebrate thinking for yourself.
1,More disappointment. Heavy on the Global Warming philosophy.,"So incredibly sorry that I spent the money for this series. It is filled with nonsense and propaganda about Global Warming. The persistent hits about Global Warming were present in every story line. I choose British series to escape the Leftist bent that dominates the mainstream media in America, yet when I turn to the Brits for some light entertainment, I get inundated with propaganda for faux Global Warming. Ugh! James Delingpole is indeed an Army of One in fighting this hoax in Britain."
4,Stephen Fry is always fun,The DVD is good. The stories are a bit thin and certainly not emotionally draining but the scenery is beautiful and Stephen Fry is always fun.
2,not quite what I thought it'd be,Yes there are 2 dolls that look just like Shirley Temple age about 6. Yes the dresses are pretty and colorful. Even accurate to her time era & quite possiable out of her own everyday childhood wardrobe If that is what you want great I hope this book makes you very happy.I admit I was very disappointed that NONE of the dresses or outfits or acceseries are from her movie costumes that's what I'd been expecting and It should really warn in the description not movie costumes If I'd known that I would have passed on it. I hope those of you who got what you wated in this have hours of fun and bonding time. Those of us imagining something else are now fairly aware of what we'd get hopefully knowing that you'll get what it is that'd make you happy.
4,Like new,"Like other reviewers, mine came like new. I also agree with another reviewer that this is a light-ish duty drill. Certainly not for someone in construction and potentially drilling holes all day long. But for a home user like me it is more than enough. It can get pretty warm after a dozen holes or so, but thats about my max anyway. My only regret was not upgrading to the Bulldog 1"" model. At the time it was around a $10 difference but the Bulldog seems to be beefed up in several areas, not just the 1/8"" capacity increase. Not that this is a bad drill in any way but I suppose you always want the bigger tool!"
2,Demo Hammer,"Bought it reconditioned for about a 40% discount. This is good for use as hammer drill and light demo work only(tile removal pushes it to the edge) Not the right tool for hammering into slab concrete however. Tool stopped hammering on 3rd use. If yoy are a serious remodler, save for the larger ($850 ish) tool or rent one for about $50/day."
3,Brings it alive,"This books is excellent because it brings alive the pictures that the students have only imagined in their minds. The art is beautiful and eventhough there is not much print, the pictures speak for themselves."
2,A sorry excuse,"Okay this is sadly the worst in the series. They brag that Rick Hill is back because he is the original Deathstalker yet when you watch it you realise that its a way to save money buy littering the whole movie with clips from part 1 and a few from part 3. Some people like the firts movie best, some the 2nd and some the 3rd but nobody the 4th. I will say this however. Finaly the picture that Boris Vallejo drew for the movie is a seen in the movie(with the exception that Rick Hill has blonde hair). But if your a fan and you have to see it whynot. Okay I admit it is nice to see the original (almost evil himself) Deathstalker return to kill more wizards. Also there is a cool picture on the back of the box of a stone-man getting his head split open wich isn't in the movie."
1,do not buy from this Co,"I purchased the TPS from this seller it didn't get here for two week and when it did the part looked great once installed my car ran worse I had to take it and have a computer hooked up on it, and what comes up bad TPS there is a position bad so they are just sending out bad parts"
2,Not too Juicy,"The title track is slammin', but the rest of the CD disappoints. Juicy Fruit is a classic of the '80's. Unfortunately, the other songs are mundane and repetitious."
4,Absolute classic,The 80's was a wonderful decade in music. Mtume is a perfect example on that decade's magic. This album is a must have for your music collection.
5,Synopsis,"""When Matthew (Mad About The Boy, Summer The First Time) dreams, he dreams of fresh faced angels, beautiful young men from Bel Ami's stable of models. His dreams take the form of sensual fantasies. He dreams of attraction at an Eastern European sauna. A woodland voyeuristic fantasty. A photographer's seduction of his model. To Matthew, they're all angels, spectacular specimens of youthful manhood. Enjoy!"" - From Pride Video"
1,23.76 are you kidding me?!!!,"What a rip. No Kindle book is worth this kind of money. Once again, Amazon has caved to the publisher, and once again, the publisher is attempting to sell a product that is ridiculously overpriced. There are no printing, binding, shipping, or storing costs for a Kindle book. Ergo, no reason to price it this high."
5,Great Insiders View of the Business,"This is a fascinating account of the US-based Cruise business. Now in its second edition, the authors contrast their views of a decade ago with where the business is today. The strongest part of the book in my view is the discussion of the different ways the cruise lines have built - and plan to continue to build their businesses. Interestingly the clarity of the strategic thinking varies from the clear and focussed (Carnival) to some other, weaker, waffle. Reading this it becomes clear that Carnival's growth to number one has been no accident. Other parts of the book are not as strong (the history section has some schoolboy howlers) or not as interesting to this reader (how to run a Travel Agency). Nonetheless, an invaluable insight into the cruise business, and a lot better than some of the other gossip-driven 'histories' out there."
2,Cruising 101 for Employees,"A wonderful, detailed view of the cruise business and of great interest, I would think, to aspiring executives in the industry. For the rest of us, its another matter. Way too much detail and information that the average or even enthusiastic cruiser would not want or appreciate, and some of the text is simply not that well written.I read the book and am now waiting for my course credit."
4,Good writing and critique; great reproductions,"Hughes is a fine, trenchant writer who knows American art. He is a good teacher. The best thing about this book, though, is the superb quality of the reproductions, all (?) of which are in color. There are some surprising ommissions (Church's icebergs are nowhere in sight), but this is a completely subjective complaint. This book is really a good bargain. The binding on the paperback is suspect, but it is nothing a little book tape won't fix."
3,American Visions by Robt Hughes,"The book is great, but the copy I received had extensive underlining in the text."
1,decide for yourself,"""I don't listen to what art critics say. I don't know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is."" - Jean Michele BasquiatFor anyone who doesn't know, the profession of ""art critic"" is obsolete. That's why this book gets one star. I picked it up because I was made to believe it was an article of history, or fact if you will; instead what I got was someone trying to tell me what to believe about other people's work. I dictate my own feelings. Hughes' only way of making art is to criticize that of others, yet the very people he criticize, such as Arthur Rimbaud and Jean Basquiat will always have something Hughes will never comprehend, originality."
1,Please!,"Well, it's not surprising that the author of this book chose to belittle the work of on of America's Great Afro/Latino artists. It seems as if the author, with no real recourse, took it upon himself to speak of someone so lowly whom he never had a chance to meet. This author has no real understanding of Basquiat's work and it is plainly obvious in the words used to describe Basquiat as ""the Little Black Rimbaud of American painting..."" I would not recommend this book to anyone of Afro/Latino Descent interested in a serious study of Black art..."
4,Saints Go marching In - Preservation Hall Jazz band,This is a quitessential dixieland jazz band! If you like dixieland jazz you will love this CD. The solos of all the members and their instruments is fun and is a a highlight of the CD.
5,Nice value!,"I actually live near this manufacturer, and I got one of these in person. They are so nice! Very lush and full, and fragrant! I am tickled with the product and highly recommend it!"
4,Bel Canto fan,"As a light opera and operetta fan I am glad to add this DVD to my collection, but it will not be a favourite. I have a poor copy of a Morbisch Festival production but I prefer those singers to these ones. Am especially disappointed in Lisa / Pitsch-Sarata who didn't always hit her top notes too well.However, overall it is a worthwhile addition and Lehar fans need to have this popular operetta."
3,You know what you'll get,"I'm no expert in this great game since we don't have the opportunity to watch US Football games in France.But still...This DVD gives a nice review for each Super bowl game.Unfortunately, these reports are quite short and only give a brief presentation for each game.Good for those who want to watch an overview of these decades of spectacular sport events."
3,Good product with some questionable ingredients,"This shampoo is very nice, it smells great, suds well and left my hair squeaky clean and softer than with other shampoos. I am concerned with the score it got in the Skin Deep database though. It seems to contain a number of ingredients that should probably be avoided. For that reason, I will not be purchasing again."
4,Serkin and Beethovan - wonderful combo,"I love this CD. Beethovan is my favorite classical composer and Serkin plays his piano compositions with power and real joy! The mixture on all the pieces in this recording is a delight to hear, and I love the way the melodies repeat themselves with the orchestra, the piano, and in the Choral Fantasy, the choir. It may be less than one hour, but it is the quality not quantity that I appreciate!"
3,AM/FM Tuner hard to turn,The knob on the tuner is really hard to turn. Otherwise it is sturdy and arrived without any scratches or nicks. The turntable and cd player works very well and has good sound quality
3,Combat Season 5 Invasion 2,I purchased this product for my Mother - she has not seen it yet but I am positive she will enjoy as she has the previous ones.
4,Garrison's Gorillas,"I will second to the other reviewer regarding ""Garrison's Gorillas"" release on DVD.In terms of action, I definitely think ""Garrison"" was better than ""Combat"""
4,Comprehensive,This is one good book to begin with if you are studying sports massage! The illustrations on the various techniques are comprehensive and easy to follow.
5,"A blessing for grandmother, grandchild & everyone inbetween.","This book tends to appear in the stores around Mother's Day. Last year I noticed it but thought I'd get it next trip. It was GONE the next trip. This year I got it! Don't hesitate! Buy this book! Take your time and write in your memories. What a blessing this book has been. Kyle, my grandson, is only 1 year old, but his mom sure has enjoyed reading my answers to these memory-provoking questions. Wonderful format, attractive, timeless book."
2,Very pretty but ....,"I agree with the reviewer who thought that this was not a book for any but the most conventional family. The questions about the ""County Fair"", kite-flying etc are very culture-bound, and it is all a little folksy and old-fashioned for the educated, energetic baby-boomer grannies of today! For example, there are questions about school (what was your favourite subject, influential teachers etc) but no suggestion that Grandma might have gone to University, or graduate school, had a career or travelled ... altogether a nice idea and a pretty book, which I'm having great difficulty filling in for my Grandson!"
5,The Best Grandmother Book!,I looked for a long time for a book for my mother and this one is the absolute best. It asked for just the right amount of special information about her life--it wasn't overwhelming to her. And we both loved the illustrations.
