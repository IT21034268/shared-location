4,Quality show,"This is a good poker show, with a great final table. A lot of personality at this table and a really cool runner up.No spoilers, but the best looking player takes 2nd. The analysis of the hands could have been better and the tournament structure was a bit fast. But other than that, it was fun to watch and a lot of exciting all in showdowns."
2,Did not do what I thought it would do.,"I bought this to make DVDs from my computer, but you loose so much quality converting from the computer signal to a TV video signal that I went back to useing a video camera and recording right off the computer LCD screen to the DVD. I do not recomend it for serious copying from the internet. I used the S video hook up as they suggested for the best converson, but it was still poor quality."
5,A must have for a Dokken Fan,"This is a very well-produced DVD which in itself makes it very enjoyable to watch. Reb Beach does an excellent job of filling George Lynch's shoes. He is confident and plays the recognizable solos the right way with enough of his own fills to distinguish him as his own man. Don's vocals for the part have held up over the years. If you are a Dokken fan, you will enjoy owning this DVD."
5,A great live performance,"Watched a clip of too high to fly on YouTube and saw it came from this DVD, so I had to have it. Really enjoy it and highly recommend it to any Dokken fan."
2,Don't waste your money,"First off, it's not a REAL DVD (meaning formatted in 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio). Second, whoever edited it should be fired. I like Dokken, but this video totally disappointed me. The numerous split screens and jumping all over the place got old FAST. If you can find it used on ebay for $... it's ok, but don't throw away your money on this poor editing."
5,A Dokken fan dream come true.,"Dokken was one of those bands from the 80's that was kind of ignore by the critics, but not by the fans. A lot of the songs like ""Alone Again"", ""In my Dreams"" (one of the best songs on this DVD), ""Paris is Burning"" are still landmarks of the heavy/hard rock scene from the 80's.This DVD has superior quality in sound and images with a lot of creativity on the ""sub scenes"" featuring clips from their original videos. Also there are 2 excellent unplugged songs taken from the ""One Live Night"". The interview is also interesting which describes a lot of the turbelence behind the downfall of the band during the late 80's.Reb Beach (Winger, Alice Cooper) is an excellent replacement for George Lynch and in some ways he is even better!!! I think this DVD is one of the best around, not only for the music but also because of the quality and the information that it has."
2,Not quite sure about this one yet,"Overall the dvd seems fine, but my jaw felt out of alignment after one of the exercises. I will probably continue with the regime but try to be more prudent about which ones I do."
1,Ruined my face,I'm 26 and i have no wrinkles but now i have smile lines & smoker lines above my lip from using this dvd. I have never smoked in my whole life. The exercises hurt my face for days. Now i have to get collagen and a fraxel laser on my face because of this dvd.
4,Great card for the price!,"This is a powerful card that's paired with very powerful software. If you've used a physical mixer before, you'll probably catch right on. Otherwise, the software can be daunting. However it worked for me right out of the box, which was great, as I was able to figure out the software at my pace. The card puts out very good, balanced sound and has a great selection of inputs and outputs both physical and digital. You can output to 32 asio channels which is very versatile.All in all this card does exactly what I need, for the best price I've found."
2,Could not get SPDIF to work,"I bought this card as a replacement in my DAW for another card with similar features. I thought I was getting a good deal on a closeout. It seems there was a reason they were being sold for such a low price.The audio output sounds good, as do the analog inputs. However, I could not get the coaxial SPDIF inputs to work consistently. My SPDIF connection might start to come in, and then suddenly overload. I spent a lot of time with the EMU support rep. We determined that I was setting everything up correctly, and that the card was defective. They issued an RMA and I got a replacement.Unfortunately the replacement was not any better. Needless to say, if SPDIF is a feature you need, stay away from this one."
3,Got fooled by picture...,"I would probably have given it a five, if it fit in my computer... Problem was that i went by what was on the picture and didn't realize i purchased a PCIe card instead of a PCI card.. so I don't have a PCIe slot, just PCI slot. upset at two things; Amazon for putting the wrong product picture and at me for not noticing that minor detail... oh well.."
5,Great,"Must read!! I would highly recommend this great, well written book to all, especially to those of who are interested in knowing what will happen next!"
3,Buy the DVD so you can skip the irritating skits,"I love Britney to bits and pieces, but I have to skip Woodrow the Homeless Man and the talk show with the man and woman. The Woodrow part is so ugly! He looks like a grouchketeer from Sesame Street! The talk show part just stinks! It's so ugly, too! I reccomend this, but I suggest you buy the DVD so that you can skip Woodrow and the talk show."
2,WHY BUY THIS?,"Britney Spears is my favorite singer but in this show, she was lipshincing! (I'm not sure how to spell that!) Buy this video if you dare but it's a waste of money. It's cool and everything but she wasn't really singing. You dont have to believe me but, it's true."
2,Do NOT bother.......,"Ok....this tape features all of Brintey Spears' hottest singles, from ""Baby one more time"" and ""Opps...I did it again"". basically ALL her singles (not every one of her songs, ONLY her hottest signles). The danceing was well Great...but, unfortunally, you can tell she is lip syncing. Destiny's Child performs their song ""Say My Name"" and TOTALLY out staged Brintey Spears. If your're a true Brinty fan, then buy it...but I would NEVEr waste my money on this. (this show was on FOX....)"
4,A much better DVD than the first one,"This DVD is really good. Her concert is great especially her dancing, but the singing is good, too. Her acting on the Saturday night live is good, and the videos are great. The concert includes her performances of (You Drive Me) Crazy, Sometimes, From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart, Born To Make You Happy, Oops! I did It Again, Don""t Let Me Be The Last To Know, The Beat Goes On(a cover from Cher), and ...Baby One More Time. There are also great Saturday Night Live performances of Oops! I Did It Again and Don""t Let Me be The Last To Know. From the multimedia part I love the photos and her interview from Paris. If you love Britney you will enjoy in this DVD."
3,BRITNEY DOES WELL IN HAWAII,"Britney has proved that she is actually a teenage star. Her performances are of a high standard. The fans seem to adore her, especially the younger generation.The quality of the DVD is good. The Dolby Digital 5.1 effects are brought out well. However the presentation of the line up of features is bad. One would expect a full concert when he/she buys a concert version of a performance.The disappointing fact is that there are too many interruptions between Britneys' performance showing her other skits etc. The produces should have had a complete concert on one end with selectable additional features, if they wanted to show her TV talk shows, holiday travels etc.So generally this DVD is good, but falls far below expectations if one wants to see a full concert by Britney."
3,Great for the Britney fan!,"You'll see her awesome perfomance in Hawaii. You'll see her classic videos for ""Oops!...I Did It Again, Stronger, and Lucky. I have prevously seen the performance in Hawai, so I liked watching it again. The only setback was that ""Baby One More Time"" was out and ""Oops!"" hadn't been released yet. That means most songs were from ""Baby"" instead of ""Oops"" That was fine though. The sketches from SNL were awesome, especially ""Morning latte"". Overall, this is an awesome vid for the fan of Britney."
5,britney in tour,"this is a great movie if you love britney spears! look at her going on the tours. the movie is the best. own this movie and it will be the best movie ever. I,m crazy about Britney spears!"
5,totally cool :),"this is THE best britney video ever i mean it's a lot better than some other people's dumb videos (no i dont mean bsb or nsync, they're great :P) and btw britney DOES NOT lip sync. there is just a dumb delay between the screen and stuff. ever watch anyone else? same thing. maybe britney's tech people are not as good as other people's. duh! anywayz its so good! get it!!"
3,Don't have it but...,"Whatever. Everyone knows that when you're in concert and dancing your @$$ of, it's gonna be a bit difficult to sing. And think about when she put the CD together. She sings just fine on the CD, so don't cut her singing down when she's in concert because you couldn't sing every note exactly the way it should be if you were in concert."
3,"Very good, but needs to be updated.","This book will give you a good understanding of why and how Frame Relay appeared, where are its strong and weak points and how does it work inside, as well as sound criteria for implementation. However, since 1993 many things have happened, and the book needs to be updated. Frame is compared to X.25, which is almost extinct, and very little is said about Frame vs. ATM, which is now a mature technology. A more recent version would have deserved 5 stars."
3,Good to have if you need concise FR data,"A little, dinky, expensive hardcover which is pure, low-level data on the topic. Good to have if you need it. Better to complement it with a high-level book which explains the technology in a more mentally digestable format."
4,Good movies in their time,I enjoyed these two old time (1930's movies). William Boyd before he became Hopalong Cassidy and Clark Gable before he became a super star. Tex Ritter was one of my favorites when I was a kid. Very much enjoyed these two old time movies.
4,Best value. RedHat easy to install.,"Excellent screen and incredible speakers. Performance is ok. A bit heavy but is worth it. Lots of nice features. Better looking than Dell or Acer, but not as nice as Vaio's. Mouse pad sometimes behaves erratically. Great price! Installing RedHat 7.2 as a dual boot system (shared with XP) is a piece of cake."
4,Great value for a great laptop,I recently purchased this laptop earlier this year. It's very easy for a person who has basic knowledge of computers. But the only problem is that at times it is slow to start up. But other than that I recommend this laptop for anyone!
2,A [$$$$] doorstop,"I owned a Presario laptop about a year ago, and swore it would be the last Compaq I'd ever buy. Why, oh why, didn't I listen to my own words. When I needed a more powerful laptop I foolshly decided to get a Presario 2700 since the price was better than comperable, competing brands. Unfortunatly, you get what you pay for (who'd of thought [$$$$] would be low-end?) The first 2700 that I received had a CDR drive that died after 2 days. The computer was replaced with a new unit which was fine right out of the box. However, it soon exhibited sluggish performance, frequent system lock-ups, and nasty crashes and it continues to get worse. I spend more time fixing things than working with this doorstop. So, THIS is THE last Compaq I'll ever buy!"
5,It's awesome!,"So, you're thinking of buying the Compaq Presario 2700US Notebook. Good choice. It's everything I need as a college student. I can write reports, do research, watch movies, make cd's, and play video games. You get all this for a great price."
1,Compaq does not provide the installation CD on the package,"My system (Presario 2701US) locks up after 20 days old. When I was looking for the restore CD, I found an piece of paper saying that i must order later. I will never buy a Compaq system again."
1,Lousy modem and support,"As with another reviewer here, I have a hyperthreading Pentium P4 processor and could never get the Creative modem to work. The software update on their web site says it resolves the problem, but it doesn't - the update causes the entire system to crash. I tried e-mail support, but they kept blaming the processor/bios. I finally purchased a Best Data usb modem, which works fine. Creative won't provide a refund, so I will either try to garage sale it (and hope the buyer doesn't have the same problem) or throw it in the trash."
3,Bad software.,"If you have a hyper-threaded processor in your computer, be wary of this modem. The software that shipped with the modem was so totally flawed that my computer locked up every time I tried to dial my ISP. Creative Labs has an updated driver on their website that was supposed to fix the hyper-threading problem. However, I had to manually uninstall the old driver by wiping out a bunch of registry values (very dangerous) because the uninstaller didn't remove the bad version of the driver properly. When the new driver was finally installed, most functions worked OK but my computer still hangs up whenever the Modem-on-Hold feature is actived. So I had to disable call-waiting in the dial string to avoid inbound calls altogether while online. This modem may be inexpensive but it does not perform exactly as promised. The software and the overall design leaves something to be desired."
4,Win2000/DE5671 USB Modem,"Installs efficiently, great speed, just do not bother with Netwaiting software as it doesn't work with Zoom or Creative--get an Emerson Switchboard, which works great. The only flaw I can find is after Windows 2000 Pro shutsdown, the shutdown hangs and the computer will not shut-off unless turning off the power supply. Tech Support was great but they do not have the answer. The modem must be unplugged before you can shutdown or driver disabled. Bios and drivers analyzed but no answers. Although inconvenient, I must say, the DE5671 connects on first ring, has great speed and is worth the inconvenience."
1,Locks up my new computer,"Anywhere from 1 second to 20 minutes after going on line (it does that just fine), my whole system locks up completely and the hard reset button must be pushed.Found and downloaded the most recent drive from the creative site, but that has not helped.I have a dedicated line for internet with no call waiting or any other features, all diagnostics say the modem is fine. Nontheless, once connected it is only a matter of time before it locks up everything. Definately not worth getting.Brandon Smith"
1,"Well, I Sure Couldn't Get It To Work!","Creative Modem Blaster DE5671-1 (S/N ZSBF0122717000639A) sure was a wasted afternoon; for nothing. New drivers from the website, etc etc new phone cable, several different software packages etc. Never could get the caller id to work (my only purpose for the device). I tried the AT+ string posted here until my fingers were blue; no joy.Unless you enjoy rebuilding electronics, forget about it."
3,lousy documentation,"Just got it working by:opening hyperterminal, typingAT+VCID=1that enabled caller ID that is apparently disabled by default.I found that info on the web somewhere. The doc had nothing about that.I only bought the modem to use for a software answering machine and call blocking so getting caller ID working was crucial."
1,IT's junk just junk,The one that I receaved just didn't work.I would have been happy if it would have done caller ID.Thats all I wanted it to do but it couldent even do that.Best recomdation I can make if your looking for a good modem look elsewhere.
1,Does not fit the 1100 or the 1100b,"Doesn't fit our ancient phones. Not worth sending back, due to its original cost vs. return shipping. We tried, we failed. We live in the past. Oh well."
4,This Cat Has Style!,"Sure, it would have been great if the Chuck Jones and Dr. Seuss alliance would have continued for this outing (their ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and ""Horton Hears A Who"" are unquestionable classics) but this is a noble effort.. a VERY noble effort. ""The Cat in the Hat"" was always been my favorite Dr. Seuss book. Having said that, I felt the top notch vocal talent (Allan Sherman will forever be the Cat in the Hat, sorry Mike Meyers!) and whimsical screenplay really fleshed out the book playful theme ... and the Geisel penned songs were truly inspired! So the animation is a little off. This is going to be considered quite the classic when that stinker of a movie opens this winter!"
2,Completely unoriginal.,"This episode is compeletly unoriginal like I said above. I can't imagine why the makers of this episode would do what they did which is delete almost everything in the real book and replace it with a completely dumb storyline. I didn't enjoy it one bit. I watch it hoping for a really funny (and faithful) version of Dr. Suess's classic. I was wrong. The songs are good and you might like the new story, but even then, I don't think the new story is good. Not at all."
2,Disappointing,"...this isnot the film I remember from childhood. I'm not surewhy this version was released when there is a farsuperior version out there somewhere. The only reasonthat I've given it 2 stars is because my 2 1/2 year oldson still likes this video, but that is only becausehe loves the book. So, while it was not a completewaste of money, it is still a major disappointment."
3,Some good ideas,"But I am not sure if all the techniques are safe to use on a rabbit, some of the kneading and deeper tissue moves for example, even though the author did use the techniques on her rabbit. ( I have also been a massage therapist) But, there were enough wonderful ideas for ways to pet and stroke these sweet pets which make this a worthwhile book. The author's pet rabbit was the model and the bio about the adorable bunny was heartwarming. All in all I would recommend this book,there are great diagrams of anatomy, which I did not know regarding rabbits."
3,Not Cramped-Camped,Bill Pullman plays a neurotic submarine captain in this funny comedy. Reminds me of the Naked Gun movies!
1,Could this suck more?,"Yes, I think it could. Never have I seen a more lackluster comedic film. Afterwards I really wished that I had gotten up and left, but I just didn't want to have totally wasted the money. I really should have stayed home and burned the ten bucks -- it would have been a more entertaining show."
4,A good little pocket knife.,"This one works well. Scissors, small knife, etc. The light can be annoying. When I press it, it does not go on. I need to press again, in a certain place, to make it finally light up."
3,not for a beginner,Was thinking this was for a beginner and it is not. Beautiful embroidery but my daughter and I were a bit lost. She does have a beginner book. Look for that one first!
3,Silk Ribbon Embroidery Book,I was quite surprised at how much was added for postage. For one small book it seemed way too much.
3,Awesome book...reeked of cigarette smoke,"Purchased this book as a quick study in order to make a ring bearer's pillow for my baby sister's wedding. It had a ton of amazing flowers and the directions were relatively easy to follow. I am not a person who embroiders or does any hand sewing really at all. I loved the book, but hated how bad it smelled. I could smell it as I was opening the packaging. I wanted to leaf through the pages but the stench was so horrific it was making me sick to my stomach. I put it outside to air out for a few hours. Revisited it. It still smelled. Fanned through the pages outside and away from my body like it was one of those flip books kids would make in elementary school. When I needed to look through it, I did so outside and from a distance. I have owned the book for about a year now and it still smells and is kept in the garage. Content wise it's great though!"
5,Pleasant people to work with,Thank you for keeping me advised all along the way of this transaction. I do appreciate it. The book was much anticipated. Thank you very much
4,Good Ribbon Embroidery Guide,"This is a great book for beginners. I have not had the chance to really do a project yet, but from what I see in the book, I shall have no problem when I can get started. It has everything I think I will need."
2,Not in depth enough for the serious administrator,"While this book touches on a lot of subjects, it covers very few in depth, and skips over some altogether. With the wealth of NT books out there, a serious NT user or administrator should look elsewhere."
2,Bad Book,"This book is great for someone who will first see and use Windows NT Server 4.0, but for someone who has already worked with NT will find this book very unusable."
5,Great!,The ball mount worked great. I got it in red and it looks good with a chrome ball. The red one had the best price at the time so its the one I got. Its a great hitch!
5,Exactly what I got,I had expected the retaining pin to come with it but it didn't. The product is very nice though. I'm very pleased with it.
4,Strong and well finished,"Very strong great finish, would buy it again, wish it was adjustable and the shank could be longer but for what it is you can't go wrong."
2,Drop down Hitch,"I ordered this product on the description that it was a four inch drop. It is not. It is three and a quarter inch drop. It is also rated at 7500# towing, not 6500. The description for this is wrong."
1,"Curt Mfg New Math: 3.5"" = 4""","This item 45050 is advertised as having a 4"" drop, but upon arrival the label confesses to only a 3.5"" drop. I measured to confirm this fact. This is the correct item identified at multiple vendors as having a 4"" drop, Curt just calls it by the wrong dimension - well let's call a lie a lie.If your tow measurements can allow for 12.5% slop, then this a well-painted, solidly-built 3.5"" drop ball mount.Until they correct the item description/name, I'd suggest you steer clear of Curt and try a more honest brand to get what you order."
4,Lucia is unlike any other..........,"I first heard Drill on The Empire Records Soundtrack. The whole cd is really good, but Drill stood out with their track ""What You Are"". The version on the soundtrack is much shorter than the cd version. I finally found the cd (I had to buy a used copy myself). I was not disappointed. Lucia's vocals are amazing and the songs are well written. She is able to scream and then also achieve her other vocals as well-showing her range. My personal favs include ""What You Are"", ""Go To Hell"", ""I Like You,"" and ""Over And Out."" Drill is no more, but if you crave more of Lucia Cifarelli you can purchase the MDFMK album (2000), as well as the KMFDM albums released after the MDFMK album. A must have (along with this Drill cd) will be her solo album released by Universal titled ""From the Land of Volcanos."" Check out http://www.kmfdm.net for pics & more info on Lucia. She is one of the hardest working & underappreciated women of rock out there!"
5,A great rarity!,"At first, I had mixed feelings about the voice of the lead singer. After several more listens, I understood why. She has a unique style of expression. It's not a bad thing, but very much appreciated. I agree with one other review on here (that she could do without the yeah, uh huh parts). Great stuff, nonetheless. Great bass lines, too! The bassist doesn't stay still!"
2,uhuhuh,"Amazing to me that the lead singer of drill is the same person now in kmfdm (and also mdfmk). The music is obviously different frpom kmfdm, as would be expected, but she doesnt sound the same at all. The music is overall good generic hard rock, the songs near the end a little more offbeat, but Lucia's vocals... theyd be alright if she didnt do the uhuhuh thing at the end of almost every verse. Her voice has range, but theres no reason to jump it around so much, its annoying."
4,Very nice quintet recording,I like quintet recordings very much so the addition of a trumpet player (actually it's a cornet if I'm not mistaken...) to Monk's quartet adds some very nice flavour. I wouldn't say this is an essential CD to own but definitely it shouldn't be missed.
4,"nothing but ""sudden fun""","The band is Matthew Winegar and Josh Freese. You may recognize both musicians names. Josh is a well known studio drummer extraordinaire. Matthew has helped out Primus on the ""Sailing the Seas of Cheese"" album.The stand-out tracks are : I Wanna Go, Corduroy, Take Me Down, and I Wonder if You're Right.Solid album by far."
5,Great motivational book!,I love this book. The drawings are so cute and cartoonish. It reminds me so much of my childhood!
3,Too dark in tone for my tastes,"This book is kinky, not in the sexual sense but in the psychological one. The illustrations are disjointed and the abstract appearance of the figures is similar to Picasso's work. There are creatures with several heads, elongated legs, misshapen faces and other absurd protuberances. The main theme is about feelings, generally depression and other types of sadness.Although this book is designed to help someone cope with feelings of sadness and despair, to me it would do precisely the opposite. The figures are not uplifting and bright, they reinforce feelings of aloneness and the concept that you are ""bent out of shape."" It is too dark in tone for my tastes."
5,works well,"one bottle last about three weeks with the vent half way open, i def think it is worth the money!"
2,Glade plugins,Each of the refills I have used have been overfilled and drip and run when you take the cap off. The scent does not seem as strong as the refills I have purchased in the past. I don't think I will be reordering this product.
5,Who doesn't love these?,They keep my house smelling so great and this totally beats going to the store. Now the house smells like a home 24/7!
1,confused,I don't understand. These are listed as $35.25 ($2.95/count) for a 6-pack. Do the math. $2.95 * 6=$17.70.What gives???
5,BEST on the market,"We love these things! we like that we can keep them ""on low"" until the hot & sweaty teenagers come in from sports, then turn up the level of coverage. Doesn't eliminate odors, but kinda' just puts a sweet scent over them, not too strong & when the kids have cleaned up, we put them back on lowest setting. Also like, just two will cover large living/dining room & bigger den areas.Six-pack is MOST economical we've found ANYwhere.Thanks, guys, you have a good product here....& NO unnecessary fans, sensors, batteries or having to press a button for product release."
4,Classic low-budget drama,"When ""Alligator Eyes"" was first shown back in 1990, it made quite an impression for it's twist on the buddy-road-film genre. For whatever reason, the picture is forgotten today; even this bare-bones dvd took forever to come out, and when it did, noone noticed. But ""Alligator Eyes"", seen today, has lost little of it's quirky charm and remains a thoroughly engaging (if a bit odd) experience. One wonders why the lead actress never went on to any success, and why one of the actors moved on to Zima commercials, but who said life was fair? Recommended."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"This set sucks. When I bought it, I thought I was getting all the NG shows on 7 disks.Just like the TIME LIFE: WORLD AT WAR collection. That is a box set with 5 disksand 6 titles on each disk. THIS is their pick of what THEY think is great.The Ultimate National Geographic DVD Collection contains:7 disks:1) 30 Years Of National Geographic2) Nature's Fury3) Secrets Of The Titanic4) Surviving Everest5) The Battle For Midway6) The Photographers7) Tigers Of The SnowSo you pay $150 for 7 disks (that's $21/ per disk) and you don't get to choose which ones.You are better off buying them separately, and picking the ones you like.Ultimate it is NOT."
4,Great for a Nat. Geo. ...,This is all the Nitional Geographic DVD's in one box. If you plan to get them all or want to give as a gift it's great. A little ... but still a good value.
5,it's better,"I got this as a price fill-in for my free shipping, but this is what I use for my car oil plug. These are durable like my original back in 2002 when my car was new. The cheap chinese black rubber ones you can use only one time and hope it doesn't leak ( they just go flat). This you can use over again. I use them for 3 oil changes. They still look good and not flattened out, but I change it anyway after 3X. They are cheaper at my local store though."
4,MASC 151 Review of Textbook,"I thought the textbook was reasonably priced and extremely informative. This has been one of the most beneficial textbooks I have bought while in college that I can use after this semester for more reasons than sitting on my bookshelf. I found myself learning more about the different medias we use on a daily basis as well as how technology has changed throughout the years. Overall, I thought the textbook was well written and I would recommend it to other Mass Communication classes."
4,Finaly not another boring text book,Media Now is a very good book becuase it is up to date and is very injoyable to read. The book talks about issues now and of the future and not so much of the past as so many other text books. It is a nice change from those ordinary and boring text books.
4,Right on time,Media Now is a wonderful text due to it being so up to date. Many text are repetitive and contain many historical facts already know to the reader. Media Now relayes those facts as well as innovations that haven't even come about yet. It takes you from the past and brings you beyond the future. It is definatly easy to read and food for thought. A mass comm students dream.
2,"Lots of information, needs an editor","This book is useful as a reference and a detailed chronicle. For the average reader, it is far too wordy. It needed a good editor. This book should be half the length it is. Sadly, the overall picture gets drowned in the details."
1,Don't buy this book based on it's title.,"I was very disappointed in this book. I was looking for a book on SS7 and SS7 over IP. This book is more of a chapter from a book. 21pages, mostly diagrams of signaling layers. This e-book does little to nothing to explain concepts in it's title. Unless you want to pay 8 bucks for a few good definitions of very well known technical words, don't waste your money. The only thing that I will say good about this book is that Lawrence Harte at least used his spelling and grammer check when writing it."
2,2 stars,"We purchased four units for warehouse kiosks at our plant.The num lock will sometimes activate on these units for no apparent reason. One unit arrived with loose connections, and has an intermittant fault. A bit dissapointed with the quality of this item"
4,"Great size, keys could be better","This is the perfect sized keyboard you've been looking for, if you want to get your mouse next to your keyboard on a smallish under-desk keyboard tray. It is a tremendous help ergonomically to have the mouse in the lower, nearer position. However, the keyson this keyboard are small, and have a very light bounce to them, and it is easy to mistype. Adesso could do more to give the keys a distinctive feel, so you really know where your fingers are. But if you are a decent typist, and don't mind running spell-check from time to time, this can work well."
3,Great size but,"I love mini keyboard and used several ones.This is quiet nice. When I touch it I can hear very good sound.However, it has some problems.There are two windows keys; left and right of space bar.The left one is ok, but the location of right windows key is so bad.whenever i try to put right-Alt, I touch the windows key.(And the right-Alt is so small!) Because of this key, space bar become smaller than other mini keyboard. And it has tooooooooooo small backspace and enter, just half size I think.(Actually all rightside keys are smaller than normal size.)If you just use this for internet or so, it will be fine.It occupied less space than normal keyboard.But if you are a programmer or a heavy type-writer, than aviod this key board. You can meet many typos."
3,"Well, it is small",I needed a small keyboard. This one is small and affordable. It's kind of annoying to use though. Maybe it's not fair to complain about it - since it's serving a purpose (being small) - but my general impression of the keyboard is not favorable.
3,"Great size, feel and looks. Don't last very long, however","I've had four of these keyboards consecutively. I really like the size, which conserves desk space, and I like the feel of the keys. There are a couple of problems I've noticed. The first is that they accumulate a lot of debris under the keys and they are very difficult to clean. Sooner or later one or more of the keys will stop working and it can be quite a job to dislodge whatever is under it. The second one is that after a year or so one or more of the the keys stops working altogether and it's time for a new keyboard. I wish they would last longer."
1,Some keys didn't work - sent it back,"The good: It is small.The bad: The layout of the keys was poorly thought out.The ugly: Numerous keys didn't work & I had to go through the whole RMA thing to send it back. Amazon.com was very helpful, gave me an RMA w/o any trouble & they paid for return shipping.So: 1 star for the keyboard, 5 stars for Amazon.com's customer service."
2,Poor quality.,This product is not manufactured to quality I expected. Housing has large gaps and the keys are uncomfortable. Functions keys are not available for multimedia applications. I don't recommend this product.
4,old favorites that entertain,"The music on the samples provided are slightly higher standard than most recordings of these titles. However, most tunes sampled were rather monotone in their delivery.Companies need to looking for music that is thematic in nature and provide children (early years toddler to prekindergarten) opportunties to move with the music. Most children in this age bracket need lots of movement and faster paced music."
4,Not your usual female lead,"I liked this because it was different than other detective novels I've read recently. Jack isn't the typical female lead detective -- i.e., she's not young, hot, and sexy. Instead, Jack is 46, going grey, and showing the effects of 15 years of chronic insomnia. And her latest live-in just left her for his personal trainer. She becomes a focus of ""The Gingerbread Man"" after he spots her taking charge of his crime scene. Not only do you get Jack's side of things in this story, you get his. The portrayal of the FBI here is pretty laughable and inaccurate, but I understand that it's meant to be comic relief, nothing more. I'll definitely read more books in this series."
4,Good read,I loved Jack. She wasn't annoying or whiny and the plot for the story was gruesome but man was I enthralled. This was a nice find!
1,Don't waste your money,"I cannot understand all the glowing reviews for this book. Because of them I went out and bought it in hardback and I am very sorry I did. I recommend anyone tempted to do the same get it from the library instead. I didn't find it to be well written or original. The funny parts woven in were good I will admit but the rest (of what I could bring myself to read, which was not the entire book) was rehashed standard mystery stuff ( and I LOVE a good mystery). This just wasn't worthy of finishing in my opinion."
1,Disgusting author,The author does believes that people being tricked into buying books on fake reviews is okay; it is not. Rate his garbage low; he is a charlatan who gets by on deceit.
1,Disgusting,The writing was great but the murderer and what he does to his victims was horrible That is not what I want to read for entertainment. It was too much for me. It was disgusting.
4,A sip of humor with a splash of serial killings - mixed well,"For a first book in a series, this is a solid effort. Detective Jack Daniels is a great character with some interesting issues of her own to work with. In addition the serial killer is a pretty nasty piece of work, and keeps the suspense building till the end.Konrath does a good job injecting just the right amount of humor into the story. He also keeps the pacing quick and fun. This is a good read that goes quickly and is intriguing enough to make the reader want to see where Konrath goes next. Recommended."
5,Great book,Really didn't want it to end. Love books about serial killers and this one was very good. Ordering the next one now. Glad I found this series. Hope the next are this good.
5,Great Book!!!,"Really loved this book - great read. Looking forward to reading the entire Jack Daniel's series, as well as, the thriller novels under Konrath's pen name, Jack Kilborn."
4,We Need More Female Detectives,"And Konrath has delivered. This deathless genre takes another twist into humor with this wonderful debut effort.Kinsey Milhone has gotten us to a place of frustration with her Nancy Drew-ish plot devices and artificial descent into lawbreaking. ""Ten Big Ones"" did not sparkle like Janet E's other stuff, which might telegraph that she might be Plum out of new ideas.So we need more female detectives. Konrath walks where angels fear to tread too: he's a male writer creating a hard-bioled female character. I think he did a fine job, creating a lively, amusing and smart woman who has problems just like everyone else. He does convey, though, the sheer delight in the chase and the capture which any good cop must have in abundance.Looking forward to the next one..."
4,Fun and creepy at it's best!,"This was great! The characters are marvelous, the dialogue is crisp and funny, and yet the killer is creepy and terrifying. The story is fast paced and doesn't let up; it's a definite ""don't bother me, I'm reading"" book, but you might want to read it during the day as the villain is that awful. It's a wonderful balance in contrasts and a very good read. I've ordered book two, and I'm ready for it."
4,Looking forward to more!,"Jack Daniels is the female Harry Bosch. Good plot, interesting characters, and a truely disturbed killer make for a ""couldn't put it down"" book. J.A. Konrath shows us that a female character doesn't have to be below the age of 30 to be tough and appealing."
4,"Fun, Quick Read!","I discovered this series when shopping for books for my Kindle; police procedurals are a favorite genre of mine and this series does not disappoint. Characters are interesting and there is plenty of snappy repartee. As with Sue Grafton's ""Kinsey Millhone"" series and Janet Evanovich's ""Stephanie Plum"" series, Konrath's books are fast, funny, interesting reading. I started with this volume - Whiskey Sour - and am working my way through the ""Jack Daniels"" stories. And, you can't beat the price on the Kindle version. Great entertainment for the money!"
4,Ready for another shot of Jack Daniels,I truly liked this book. Jack is a great character. Loved the characterization of the Feebs. Good and creepy villan. I already bought Bloody Mary. I hope the series continues strong!
1,TRYING to say something nice...,"Whoo-hoo and Holy Cow. This is a bad one. And the worst part is, it's the June '05 selection of our library's mystery club so I HAVE to finish it. I was shaking my head by the end of the FIRST PAGE!!! We go from descriptions of ""Jack""'s wardrobe to yukky descriptions of the murders that Richard Montonari did a lot better in HIS newest, ""Rosary Girls"". I wouldn't insult Stephanie Plum by comparing her to Jack Daniels. Nothing about Daniels seems real. She's tries waaaay too hard to be ""tough"". Patricia Cornwell tried the same thing, but Kay Scarpetta came off just a little masculine and more vulnerable than anything else. Jack Daniels reminds me of a third grader on the playground trying to bully down the first graders. I probably shouldn't dis this book because I'm only on page 30, but it REALLY stinks. If anyone sees anything good in this book, please let me know. I really want to like it, but..."
4,Gritty,"First time with this author and this character. Jack D. is a stereotypical gritty, hard-living cop except she's a woman. Nice twist. Will be buying more in the series."
1,Ugh! A waste of paper and money!!!!,"What in the world?! All the glowing reviews above have GOT to be from friends and family This book was horrible: it takes every cliche known to man and throws it into one book dumbed down and mediocre in both plot and writing. The cliches about the female protag are particularly offensive -- I can guarantee you the author is a man hoping to catch a ride on Evanovich's coat tails. Even the title and protag's name are forced, never mind the auhtor's idea of what ""tough"" women are like. Ugh. I would recommend virtually ANY other female detective/P.I. series over this crap. Shame on the author and the publisher."
4,Good Mystery,"I like the way the book led you to the killer and how he was finally caught. The lady Lt. Jack Daniels is very intelligent and learned in her work. Years of experience and intuition helps her to ""get the bad buy""."
3,Whiskey Sour,"If you love this genre, you'll love this book. I don't usually read this type of thing, but a friend recommended it. It was a quick, fun read, and though the suspense lacked on occasion (seemed like the editor got a little red-pen happy on the author... it was choppy in places), I'm glad I read it. My only real criticism was that there were some plausibility issues. (After being watched for some time by the killer in the closet, Jack ""suddenly"" gets a chill down her spine and knows he's there. I had a hard time buying that one.)"
5,"""It's just one more layer on the s*** cake.""","What a great, fun, rollicking start to the Lieutenant Jack Daniel's mystery series.""Whiskey Sour"" starts out in Chicago with Jack's (for Jacqueline) boyfriend leaving her for his muscle-bound personal trainer, Roxy. And things go downhill for Jack from there.When she isn't shooting pool with an ex-con, she and her partner, Detective First Class Herb Benedict, are doing everything in their power to track down a sociopathic serial killer who calls himself The Gingerbread Man.As strong female protagonist, well-developed characters, snappy repartee, an evil villain - all join together for a grand police procedural. A few characters are stereotypical but that doesn't detract from the story, in my opinion.I loved the story and am looking forward to startingBloody Mary, the second book in the series, next."
2,Yuck,"I am a huge fan of the strong female protagonist and I believe the world needs more of them. Trying to be a man does not make one a strong female protagonist. The plot is thin and its holes are filled with gratuitous violence. Stackng one cliche on top of another is not, and never will be, good writing. Skip it."
3,Just OK,"This book was recommended to me by the clerk at Borders, so I obliged and purchased a used hardback through Amazon, as the paperback's print is so very tiny, my aging eyes would have definitely revolted. I had just finished reading ""Too Late to Say Goodbye"" by Ann Rule. There is no comparison. Ann Rule is a true professional, showing great depth of research and character development with a flair for reporting in a mysterious way that doesn't allow one to put her true-crime murder mysteries down. In contrast, Korath's first book seems amaturish - almost juvenile. The book CAN be put down, but luckily the chapters are short enough to allow one to do so almost at will. It's easy to pick up again -WHENEVER... I purchased all of the books in the Jack Daniels Mysteries series and hope they improve as Konrath gains experience. Mediocre, slightly humorous, and a little sickening. M.Ed.x2"
3,Formula But Fun,"No surprises here; the tough female cop, lonely, self-depricating, the tough-but-nice-guy boss, the idiot G-men. Seen it all before. Light, breezy story, made me question how such horrific crimes could be dealt with so lightly, like the author was trying to make a decision to go hardboiled or poached and chose a combination of the two. Okay beach read, won't be going back for another dip into the next one in the series."
3,An Okay Read For Me,"For me, this was an okay read to pass the time. I really enjoyed the humor in it. For me, it was a little predictable, as you could see where it was going. And some of the answers where gift wrapped. Like the detective just suddenly came up with an idea out of thin air that turned out to be the solution, and no other clues were considered after that. And for some reason, the Jack never came across as a real female to me. If you enjoy colorful mysteries, you'll probably enjoy this one."
4,JACK DANIELS SERIES. Audiobook.,"This is the first of the Jack Daniels Series by Jack Kilborn.The narrators were fantastic.The author is great.It is the suspense genre that will make you laugh.You need to read all of them in order.Some are better than others, but all of them are worth reading to get the full effect.And when I say read all of them, there are books that are not in the ""Jack Daniels"" series that include Jack and the other lively characters.Be sure to read Serial Uncut before you read Stirred, the last one in the series."
5,A WILD ROMP WORTHY OF HIAASEN!!!,"What a funny and witty romp of a novel- up there with Hiaasen and Shames- JA Konrath surpasses Dorsey with his novel- full of wacky characters and never a dull moment plots- this book is perfect for the reader who wants to smile,laugh and read great writing!!!A JAMES MASON COMMUNITY BOOK CLUB MUST READRICK FRIEDMANFOUNDERTHE JAMES MASON COMMUNITY BOOK CLUB"
4,Famous Last Words,"This is an excellent collection of last sayings from a very wide collection of people and movies. From Mick Jagger to Oscar Wilde, the lines keep coming. I found it to be an excellent toilet book (one that can be read in short breaks)."
2,Not useful; there were many inaccuracies,"Alas, I found many inaccuracies in this one. Not just in the quotes themselves either, but also in the annotations that accompanied them. It's a shame, because it's a large collection."
4,An amazing piece of history told very well!,"The story of the Blizzard of 1978 - and of the ill-fated ""Can Do"", is told in a way that non-mariners can understand (not too much tech talk) and enough detail for the seamen to enjoy. I love how the author weaves other historical story lines through his main plot. I learned a lot about the history of the area and the Coast Guard. It was an easy read - enjoyable like fiction, but educational as well."
3,A Long Rough Ride,"The essence of the story is interesting. But in the long run - and it is a long book - it fundamentally repeats the horrors suffered by so many boaters and ocean going folk when they venture, willingly or unwillingly - into the ravages of tne Ocean. The one thing I did learn that surprised me, is that back in the 70s, New England suffered a storm similar to Sandy, with worse effects. The liberal news media today makes it sound like nothing like Sandy ever happened before. My answer is ""get over it""."
5,Incredible True Story of Rescue at Sea,"Mesmerizing true tale of men and the sea during the great blizzard of February 1978. If you have ever gone to sea in stormy weather you will be awestruck by this story of the bravery and desperation of seamen engaged in a monumental rescue attempt. Surpasses ""The Perfect Storm"" in my opinion. A definite candidate for the big screen."
2,Some things missing,What happened to encryption? That is a great new feature in SQL 2005..hard to believe its not mentioned in the guide.
1,Which version is it?,I'd feel more comfortable about buying this book if the sample pages actually referred to SQL Server 2005 instead of SQL Server 2000. Some of the reviews are dated 2004. So which product does this book cover?
2,To Move a Lot of Stuff,"The True Temper shovel did the trick for me. I needed a high volume delivery shovel to move the large amounts of leaves that fall from my 150 year old oak tree. The shovel holds four times more than the ones I already owned.The quality seemed good at first. Now I notice that after owning it for one month and using it 3 times to shovel leaves, the plastic D handle is cracked. Not a sign of good quality. Also, I cannot see any indication of where it was made. Suspect it is of Chinese origin.Easy John"
3,They're OK,I used the cutters on Schedule 80 PVC and they eventually started to pop off the last ratchet. I had to shove a shim between the body and the ratchet lever to keep it engaged. The blade is pretty good and it cuts reletivly square. I think with Schedule 40 or smaller/softer pipe wall they'd be fine. Very good deal for less than $30...cheapest I could find locally was $90.
4,Good but be careful with older pipe,"This was bought at a good price and works well. I needed to cut alot of pool piping that runs along the ground so it was difficult to cut with a saw.On the newer piping it worked very well but the older piping sometimes cracked as I was cuting it. This is due to the age of the pipe and outdoor conditions which made the pipe brittle. So when cutting older pipe be careful because if it cracks when cutting and your pipe is vertical the pieces fall into the pipe (sometimes large pieces) and it is a pain to get them out.I don't know if maybe the more expensive, possibly better quality cutters, would do any better on the older piping (I wouldn't think so)."
4,A Very Exciting and Interesting Read,"This very well written story of two sister submarines was hard to put down. As a former submariner, I had heard some of the story, but this book covered interesting aspects of the history of these boats that I had never before understood. Whether you have been in the service or not, this is a terrific read."
5,"Looking for a Related Book ""Blow All Balast""","There is a book that was written shortly after the sinking of the Squalus back in the late 1930's titled ""Blow All Balasts"". I have read this amazing tale in one of the original hardcover books -- and I am dying to get my hands on it again! If ANYONE can help point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate the help."
5,English Leather,"A very good all purpose splash for men. Can be used as an aftershave, cologne, or body splash. Clean, long-lasting aroma. Great for everyday use."
4,good overview of the basics,"This video is a good overview of the basic moves. Tony and Kris show both goofy and regular, which is nice. Its humorous as well. the only problem with the video is that it doesn't cover all that much material. Other than that an excellent video for the beginner."
3,Tony Hawk Tricks,"It was enjoyed by my boys 11 and 7, the video was a bit old looking and came in a broken case."
4,Learning From the Best and Greatest.,"This is an excellent instruction DVD for beginners with no skating experience, thru intermediate skaters who want to move on to advanced techniques. Although Tony Hawk makes every trick look easier than walking and chewing gum at the same time, his instructions are thorough and understandable. This DVD will make you get off your couch and become a better skater. If you know someone who has a skateboard lying around the house, who used to use it years ago, get them this DVD - they'll be back on their boards having more fun than they ever had on it before."
4,T.Hawkls Trick Tips Vol 1:Skateboarding Basics,"My 12 year old son is very happy with this DVD saying he ""wished he had found it a long time ago."" Each trick seems to broken down in a step-by-step format that he found very helpful."
4,Good book!,"I liked this book, even though I am sick of Jacqueline Wilson's books now after reading so many of them. I loved the main character Prudence!"
1,raunchy and distasteful,"when i recieved this book from my gran i was terribly surprised at the smuttyness of the novel, im usually a fan of jacqueline wilson books but love lessons is nothing more than a trashy porn novel. i would not recomend any one under the age of 18 to read this book unless they want to be deeply scarred by the visions of peadofila which are present."
5,Happy Customer,"Great price and prompt delivery. Will definitely come back to this company! Haven't used the ink cartridge yet, but it appears to be a new quality product as promised!"
1,Very poor carriage lamps,"First I have to say this product looks great and is built well. I was very satisfied with the overall look, size and how efficient antonline was. However when installed the lights did not work as advertised and the instructions were horrible. Obviously written by someone who did not know English well. I have returned the lights at a loss to me as I had to pay shipping both ways and will probably get penalized for returning the product even though it was defective and had terrible instructions for use.I tried to reach the manufacturer for help. No contact info whatsover on the instructions or box. I called antonline and they gave me a phone number. The person there was not helpful at all, said they would call me back and never did. I gave up.Another reason I have decided not to purchase products over the internet. I will be better off dealing with a local store such a Home Depot."
5,Love his books,His books are always fun and interesting. The charictors are realistic. You hate the ones u should and want the good guys to win.
2,you saw it coming,"i knew the bronx were gonna take a turn for the worst the day i saw them as the featured band on myspace.com. i can't believe this is the same band that created heart attack american. i'm like, seriously sad about this. i was pretty messed up when justin timberlake went from pop to r & b but that can't compare to the sadness that the bronx have brought me. they should change their name from the bronx to the upstate new york. the stuff is weak."
5,"Lush,Dreamy and Romantic,","Listening to this recording on a pair of good enclosed headphones or a high quality stereo system, one can close one's eyes and drift away, with an imaginary lover, by the beach, at an open air dance floor, or perhaps even in Paris....in the fullness of an autumn moonlight.Now if only Sting's recording company issue all his music videos in a DVD with the inclusion of 'Moonlight'. I definitely disagree with the review that Sting was 'unromantic' with the song. Close those eyes and listen!"
5,"Elegantly lyrical, Sabrina is an immersion into romance.",I've played this many times and always get that dreamy feeling reminiscent of the movie. The piano score is simply elegantly delicious.
2,same tune over and over,I was dissapointed in the Sabrina soundtrack. it was pretty much different variations on the same tune. Not much variety. I was hoping for more music from the party scene.
3,"Amazon keeps shipping cd's in flimsy packaging, cracked case!!!!","The cd case was cracked when it arrived. Apparently to save money instead of using boxes they now ship using padded envelopes. And this is not the only time this has happend I recently placed another order for two cd's and they came in same cheap padded envelopes and one of the cd cases came cracked. I also placed another recent order for some small tools that I bought for my business and they shipped them in some compact carton envelope, one of the slim tools managed to fall out during shipping through a large gap in the carton. Apparently Amazon is starting to ship smaller items in cheap packaging. Apparently it doesn't matter how much money you put down for 1 day shipping or 2 day shipping they will still stick smaller items in cheap packaging."
5,"I really love this soundtrack, so beautiful! a collector's item.","After I saw this movie, Sabrina and heard its beautiful music,I decided to order one. I really felt in love with it. So romantic and inspiring. My husband loves it too and we always play it again and again and again."
1,Just Plain Bad......,"If you are a zombie movie fan, you will be disappointed in this movie. I'm not a zombie movie fan but I decided to give this movie a try. It delivers a very boring plot with a young couple getting stranded in a deserted town with stupid looking zombies roaming around. The acting was poor and this was a cheaply made movie. Boring, Boring, Boring. Not worth watching."
2,This re-animation did not work,"I like Jeffrey combs. He was a great Herbert West in the reanimator films and when he gets creepy, he makes a film fun. I also love Ellie Cornell and have from the first time I saw her in Halloween 4. I saw Jeffrey and Ellie together and thought that this was a can't miss movie. The movie started out okay then Jeff and Ellie got killed in the first 5 minutes and a totally unsympathetic cast ensemble took over. The film did actually have a plot however, and there was a real reason why zombies were running around the town so as far as that goes, it had a step up on most zombie movies, but I just could not get into it. The actors were not very good and the characters they played were not too bright. Oh well, it was diverting for a while so it is not a total waste of time. Rent it though, don't buy it."
2,Vampire+Zombie+Voodoo Curse=Big mess,"This is a movie that tries to cover a bunch of bases in one fell swoop. I would actually give it 2.5 stars, but don't get excited... this makes for either campy halloween viewing or super saturday cinema. There are some moments of cool dialogue and action, but it gets held down by a plotline that seems overly top heavy given the lack of substance. (if this doesn't make sense, watch the movie >wink<). A fair effort, but if you like this sort of movie, there are too many others out there that are cleaner, campier and easier to digest."
1,Some great actors..in a dreadful movie.,"Let's just get this out of the way. I hate this movie. In light of all the other terrible, terrible movies I've watched I probably shouldn't hate this one as much as I do, but there's just no other way to put it. I love low budget fare. I'm fine with an independent movie with no budget and a cast of first time actors that winds up being a little lack-luster. To have this lavish a set, and respectable veterans like Jeffrey Combs, Danny Trejo and David Keith, and still make such a dull chore of a movie, I find it inexcusable. I feel a great deal of my dislike come from how poorly written it all seems. The story is riddled with plot holes, the main characters come across as extremely unlikable, and with nearly every action they make, you're left asking ""Why? Why would anyone do that? Did anybody read the script and ask whether it was a good idea?"" As a zombie movie fan, I just can't steer you far enough away."
2,CAN'T KEEP A GOOD ZOMBIE DOWN,"One has to admit that out of all the horror genres, zombies are the weakest lot. Ever since George Romero trotted out the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD movies, attempts keep coming to top him, but ALL SOULS DAY isn't one of the better ones (try SHAUN OF THE DEAD instead). Credit should go to the writers for at least coming up with a reasonable scenario for the undead's return: revenge on the greedy man who was responsible for their extinction. The movie's problem lies in its incredibly slow pacing, and mediocre acting from its leads. Even brief bits by Jeffrey Combs, Ellie Cornell and David Keith can't make up for the posturing of Maria Ramirez, Travis Wester and the others. Laura Harring sleepwalks through her role as the mysterious innkeeper and the plot's inconsistencies wear thin after a while. ALL SOULS DAY won't be remembered as a classic zombie flick, but it isn't any worse than the other recent films of its ilk."
4,Norelco 9195XL vs Braun 8975,"I am a long time Norelco user who also owned a Braun a decade ago. Recently I purchased a Braun 8975 but returned it for refund in favor of a Norelco 9195. For those wondering about Norelco vs Braun I'd like to share my experiences with the two shavers.Norelco:Pros--Quiet, smooth, easy to clean, and has a compact case for travel. It shaves every hair and gets into the hard to reach places easily.Cons--Not quite (but very nearly) as close a shave as the Braun.Braun:Pro--Closest shave.Cons--MISSES HAIRS. Does 95% of the job very quickly; then you struggle to shave the missed hairs by trying different angles and pressures--very aggravating! That is why I gave up on the Braun. It is also very noisy and has a bulky carrying case. And it won't get into the tight spots like the Norelco can. Finally, it takes too long to clean.For real world use, in my view the Norelco is superior."
5,Norleco 9195XL Review,I've used Norelco products for years. This is another high quality Norelco product that works as expected. Shaves are close and comfortable.I recommend the Norelco 9195XL to all who shave.
3,The holocost project,My name is Eric leonard and am in the eighth grade and chose this book for a holocost report. this book is full of holocost poems and stories. I found many of the holocost stories touching. I would recomend this book to young adults that need to be informed about this terible time in history. I enjoyed this this book and would read it again.
1,Consumer Beware,I bought this camera as an inexpensive way to post pictures online and e-mail. The quality of the pictures is very poor and the only way to take a decent picture is in full sunlight. The camera drains batteries after one or two uses. DO NOT invest your money in this cheap excuse of a digital camera.
4,Good Enough,"I am in the camp of rabid Disney haters. Someday, Disney and their ilk will return to the deepest pits of hell where they belong. Notwithstanding this mild bias, this book actually had me impressed with Disney. No, I would not live there. No, I would not visit there. No I would not make a public comment that Celebration is a good thing. But Disney did try to put into practice all of the new urbanism techniques that so many of us have written about for so long. Disney deserves the credit for funding this experiment, and the authors deserve high praise for making this valuable point. The weakness of this book is that the authors wrote it while they still lived in Celebration. As we learned from the Lynds in their books about Middleton, you need to get away from a place to see it up close. I hope the authors do a follow up later that ties together so many open questions. I suspect the people who have bashed this book are probably Disney employees, or pathetic mouse syncophants."
2,A collection of value contradictions.,"Written by left leaning, sniveling reporters. They are critical of Disney's handling of the wetlands, yet the authors bought a house in middle of the wetlands. They snipe about Disney not giving away part of their profit margin to accommodate low income people, yet didn't rent out their ""granny flat"" to an under privileged person.As true liberals, the authors see corporations as responsible for everyone's welfare. Most of the actions of the authors in Celebration were to try to force Disney to do something. Their position seems to be that Disney should be more regulated and contribute more. It would be nice at least once to hear them thank Disney. Thank you Disney for your vision. Thank you Disney for risking your capital. Thank you for fighting the political battles to make Celebration possible."
2,POOR RESPONSE,"PRODUCT NEVER SHIPPED TO ME - I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED, I EVEN TRIED TO CONTACT VENDOR THROUGH EMAIL, NOTHING.... AMAZON DID A GREAT JOB WITH MY REFUND NO HASSLES THERE."
4,great ideas to get kids writing,"This is a fun book full of ideas to get kids writing. There are ideas for daily news writings, journal entries and reproducible story starters. The story starters correspond with specific books that you first read to your class, and then encourage your students to solve a problem or tell about personal experiences similar to those in the story."
5,A Very Helpful Aid,"What is important about Carol Simpson's wonderfully well-planned and illustrated book Daily Guided Writing for teachers of kindergarten through second grade, is that it is full of practical lessons in guiding writing plus it contains the work of several of her students. Not only does Simpson give grade by grade lesson plans on a daily basis, she encourages the use of her daily guided writing lessons in such a manner that does not demoralize the experienced teacher who has run out of ideas with which to stimulate his or her students. She realizes that there are ""...those elementary teachers who feel they need some additional ideas for teaching their students how to become good writers. The ability to communicate with pencil and paper, or word processor, is an important skill for our fast-paced world""(Preface iii). Nor does she demoralize the most important person, the young student who is keen to explore new worlds and to express him or herself."
2,Poor quality control,"Poor quality control on this product. The slip fitting part of the Y pipe wasn't expanded enough in order for the pipe to fit inside of it so I ended up having to bring that part into a shop to have it expanded a bit more. Then when I went to install the Y pipe onto my truck I found that the supplied nuts for the collector bolts were too small. Well done, flow tech."
2,Otis Sounds Like A Guest On His Own CD,"I have almost all Otis Spann's CDs and this is my least favorite so far. When I buy an Otis Spann CD, I buy it because I want to hear amazing piano playing. Unfortunately, on this CD the piano is burried deep in the mix and covered by loud guitars, drums, etc. It's almost like Otis is a guest or backup on his own CD! In fact on many songs, other people are doing the vocals! I would say skip this CD. If you want Otis at his best, I would recommend Walkin' The Blues (the sound quality is excellent and has a few piano solo numbers), Bottom Of The Blues, and Best Of Vangaurd Years."
1,Junk...,"My boss purchased this saw as an extra saw on site. Most of the crew own DeWalt circular saws, but quickly found faults with this one. First, as mentioned, the base is missing a corner for some unknown reason. Second, the base is cheap plastic, and I can guarantee that it won't last more then a month or two. Third, it won't cut straight due to the slight wobble of the blade. Last, but not least, if you use the saw for more then 30 seconds, it smells like burning wires. I'm shocked that DeWalt puts their name on it.This is CERTAINLY not a saw that should be used by professionals or anyone who needs to rely on their cuts and the saw that makes them. This is really not much more then a weekend do-it-yourselfer's saw."
4,Wonderfully Creepy,"I love the description that another reviewer gave this album: Appalachian Gothic. With it's ""roots"" instrumentation and off-kilter lyrics, Sackcloth and Ashes is the dark side of ""Oh, Brother Whereart Thou"", invoking a strange and brooding ""South"" of hidden hollows and watchful people, a place that would be familiar to William Faulkner, not to mention Mulder and Scully. The music's not religious, not in the church goin' sense, but rather plays with themes of sin and redemption, heaven and hell, good and evil, that are such a part of the American past--and present. If you're open to travelling to a strange place, you could do much worse than Sixteen Horsepower."
4,Hoodoo Bluegrass Existential Potboilers,"Sorta like REM in a rustic mood attempting to do Echo and the Bunnymen epics at their most tuneful and angst-ridden. Not that this band is imitative--I'm simply trying to describe the psychic soundscape. Moody, driven songs delivered on mostly acoustic instruments. Simultaneously lush, inviting, and poisonous--but in a good way. Certainly this band is an original, and well worth your while."
3,Beware your soul...,"I'm not particularly into bands with overt Christian messages or anything, but something about this album is intriguing to me. The style is a unique sort of dark bluegrass/country western, with twangy banjo, melanchly bandonion, and slinky slide guitar, and the holier than thou lyrics come across as foreboding and sort of creepy. I picture myself wandering into a near-deserted coal mining town in the foothills of the Smokey Mountains, and seeing a bunch of inbred cooks coming out of squeaky screen doors to sing these songs to me while lynching me for not wanting to go to church. Other 16 Horsepower albums are less dark and thus less interesting. Check this one out, and beware your soul!"
4,An amazing document of how the great Yellowman rocks!,"This CD is a long awaited live album from the dancehall great, Yellowman. It is an excellent recording of a strong, recent performance in San Francisco. He and his band shine on this CD! The editing is a bit choppy but the songs are unaffected. The best he's done in years!"
4,More bang for the buck,"Ken Tamplin and Lanny Cordola make great, heavy music together. Tamplin has a voice that can do anything and Cordola's guitar work is always genius. BIG BANG is a delicious rock album that not only leaves you pumping your fist but singing out loud."
2,An footnote in hair metal's dying days.,"My hobby is collecting Christian rock and metal music. 11 years ago, I found it on cassette in the cut out bin of a music store. Being aware that is was Ken Tamplin's continuation of Shout (which he had to change the name, due to legal issues with another band of the name name), I picked up this early 90's gem up for my collection. Being the self appointed Christian rock critic I am, I gave it a good listen. Except for a couple really strong hard rockin' tracks, their was really not much I was into. It's more of the same, commercial radio friendly rock that been done millions of times before. After I gave it a good run, I filed it away in my archives. I really got it just for the sake of collecting."
3,Solid sophmore effort from Tempe band,"Following up on NME after the band fired founder/songwriter Doug Hopkins must have seemed daunting. All of the GB are accomplished songwriters but none of them had the quicksilver talent of Hopkins. While Congradulations doesn't quite measure up to NME (or Dusted), it's a solid, tuneful album brimming with hooks.There's certainly none of the angst that defined Hopkins songs on NME. Congradulations is more of a mainstream album and, if it lacks the twists and turns of the first two albums best songs, it more than holds its own with the competition."
4,good garage rock,"Nothing brilliant or particularly clever. Just good, solid melodic garage rock, like its predecessor, New Miserable Experience. Decent songs all, and if you liked NME you'll like this one as well."
3,A Not-All-It-Could've-Been Follow Up,"This album is OK, and thats pretty much it. As compared to New Miserable Experience this album is pretty weak. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Gin Blossoms fan, but this album seems to have lost that lone, midwest, folky-rock, freshness the first cd had. Of course Follow You Down is Great, and so are songs like Whitewash and Not Only Numb. But what is up with Highwire?? I don't get that song. There's not much of a flow to the album either, and the writing feels a lot less heart-felt than New Miserable Experience or Dusted. But if your a fan, yea, pick it up."
3,"Solid, not special","Well, I do like this CD, and I don't imagine myself every putting it in my trade in pile. The sound is good, if a bit overproduced. The lyrics are introspective and personal. The band sings about things listeners can relate to. Really like the songs Virginia, Til I Hear It From You and Follow You Down. Nothign else measures up to those songs, and the CD can be a bit repetitive at times. I wish they'd have taken a few more risks. Overall, you won't hate it, though, and you could certainly do a great deal worse."
4,Sopranos come to life....,"The casual, almost semi-cynical, form of writing suits the subject of this book: A minor crime family in New York area finds itself cast in a major TV production. Although the Sopranos don't labor under the lack of respect that the Decalvacantes or ""farmers"" receive, you do get a unique perspective of the crime family imitating fiction or vice versa. Like many Mafia books, this one is episodic as I suppose it has to be and it is difficult to keep the characters in their place (anyone ever hear of a organizational tree?). Still, it is easy to read and see what is going on.The faults of the book are that the author's reporter-style writing comes through a bit much. He relies on structured chronological headings, almost like a time stamp. However, this isn't much of a fault and his style works well.I enjoyed it. It was a quick read. If you like the Sopranos, you'll like this book and it will give you more insight into the real ""real"" life characters."
1,"What a boring, horrible read",This book was a boring piece of trash. A child with a 6th grade education could have written a better book. The information was all over the place and quite inaccurate...
3,Made Men,I purchased it for a friend and have never read the book. The simply looked like some that she would enjoy.
5,Made Men,Book was sent in satifactory condition and in a prompt manner. I appreciate not having to wait for order Thank You!!
1,85 pages in an...,Im 85 pages in and nothing has happened. I dont know where its going or even what its about.
1,Use this book to line your bird cage....,"What a waste of ink!!! I wish there was a way to give this book a review of a negative 5 stars. This author is terrible. The words are mispelled there are sentence fragments riddled throughout all the paragraphs. Most of the time I had to re-read the sentence because I thought it was me. The author left me hanging many times throughout the book. I was like ""What the F$%^? Who wrote this garbage?"" He must have graduated with his Associates Degree from Essex County College in Newark, NJ. It probably wouldn't have been a bad read if it was written properly. I am surprised no one wacked him for writing so terribly. Geeeze."
2,"What really, really bothered me though was all the out loud internal monologue","Two stars means okay, but it really wasn't okay. I didn't hate it, but I did finish it so I feel that it should be one and a half stars. I used to devour Harlequin novels as a teen. I found this one laying around and it fit the parameters of a Book Challenge I was taking. Wow! Um....wow. The crime-solving plot was interesting. It was twisty-turning, making you look at all the suspects and casting blame this way and then that way. The love story, though, was completely implausible. A federal agent falls for the trophy wife he helped to put behind bars. The romance takes place over three days. What really, really bothered me though was all the out loud internal monologue. I can't understand why this author choose to have these people talk their feelings out loud? Why couldn't she just write it in the prose? It just made the characters seem ridiculous."
3,"Lots of detailed information, not very interesting","The Communism that was practiced in Russia had some major differences from the way it was described by Marx and Engels.Nicolas Berdyaev writes a very much needed analysis of where Russian Communism came from.Although there is much to be learned about how the mindset of the average Russian was shaped over hundreds of years by Roman Law and Russian Orthodox religion, the writing style leaves much to be desired. Even though I studied Russian in college for two years and have a serious interest in Russia, I had difficulty finishing this book.I give Berdyaev 5 stars for information and 1 star for the dry writing style. That averages out to 3 stars.--George Stancliffe"
2,Good idea but nowhere close to expectations,"This book looks like it was written by someone who works in their own garage as a hobby. There is no real technical data in this book-- no hint of professionalism.The photos are black and white and most of the time they don't really show what the book is talking about. There are no torque specs. Little detail or warnings on how things are done.With the quality of this book, you're better off saving the $30 and pulling the jeep apart yourself to see how it works."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book because I was rebuilding my T 176 Transmission. The preview stated that it gave information on transmission rebuilds. Well it does, but not on the one I have. Does not give info on the T176/T178 tranny. After I bought the book I realized this is one mans rebuild of a Jeep as it should be in his mind. Stick with the Chiltons. Overall I did not find this book useful."
3,"just what I needed , almost!",I ordered this book needing a wiring diagram for my 77 cj5. The only wiring info is about the authors own jeep 72 cj5. I should have done a little more research before ordering. I was able to get the diagram I needed FREE on the Internet .I can still use other info SO......
2,Not what you expect,"The book is well illustrated and well written, but does not really apply to the average shade tree/geekmo mechanic such as myself. Hanes or Chilton does a much better job explaining average maintenance. One thing I was looking for was lacking - how to upgrade the smogged up engine by way of a weber carb conversion. The only option in this book was to go with a fuel injection system - expensive and technical. A disappointment for me, but for the master mech, excellent."
5,loved it,"Expertly detailed by a master mechanic: his shop pratices and many tricks of the trade alone would be worth the price of the book. I found a lot of informations I can directly use in my project, not only the ""how"" but also the ""why"" and ""why not"". This book touches on the fact that most modifications have both advantages and inconvenients and will save me time and money. Clear and concise writing."
4,Tight song from Master P's son,"This song is catchy and tight, and Lil Romeo(who is Master P's son if y'all didn't know) comes tight here. Be on the lookout for his album ""Soulja Boy"" coming soon!"
5,Another hot motown sampler!,"They did an outstanding job sampling the Jackson 5's I want you back. This latest motown sound update is off the hook. Miss Peaches who sings the chorus sounds just like little Michael, and the lyrics are almost the same. Also, Lil' Romeo is cool. Buy this hot single before it's gone."
4,Nice Puffy-like song,"I've got to give Lil' Romeo his props. This is a tight song even it has a Puffy-like sample. And judging by the snippets, his album is going to be tight!"
3,"So far, pretty good","Just a note that in the video demo, obviously the ice covered windshield has been warmed up from the inside, as the ice is pushed off in one big sheet on the IceDozer side, which only happens if the defroster has been running for a while. In real life, banging the ""teeth"" into thin hard ice on a cold car doesn't do much to tenderize it. Works better on side windows where you can lean into the handle over the blade, and push with the other handle, but you can't do that on the windshield and back window, so it's essentially like a regular old ice scraper. Have only had a couple chances to use it this winter, but I am a little disappointed so far."
2,Dozer just OK,The Ice Dozer was a little disapointing. The handle could be 4 inches longer and the ice scraper blade isn't any better than the standard ice scraper.
1,Piece of junk,I read all the reviews and thought I would try it even though there were a lot of bad reviews.Major complaints:It is just like a cheap scraper in that it only shaves a small strip of frost off the window and not a massive sweep like it advertises.Very hard to use. I am 6' tall and tried to use this on a 2007 Camry. So I was plenty tall enough and a Camry is not a big car. I was having to lean up against the car just to get everything. Not user friendly at all.Minor complaints:Not very sturdy. Mine didn't break on the first use like other reviewers but it did feel like it could snap at any time. There are a lot of pieces which means a lot of potential for breaking.Overall:I am returning this product. It does not perform as advertised. It is almost completely useless.
1,Do not Buy!!!!!!!,This is a worthless piece of crap. The handle broke the first time I used it and the ice was not that thick. It is made of cheap plastic and don't buy this.
2,Doesn't live up to claims,"I'm in the Boston-area and most winter mornings I wake up to ice on my windshield. I was looking for something that would cut through thick ice, as well as lighter coatings, quickly and easily. I was hopeful for the IceDozer, but ultimately disappointed with the performance. It definitely does not clear large swaths in a single swipe, as the description claims it will. That was one of the things I was looking forward to. The way you can grip the handle to apply pressure is nice, but it does get awkward as you try to reach the center of the windshield. My bottom line is that it's not any better than a regular plastic scraper, with the downside that it's very large to store in your car."
2,Works in some cases.,"I haven't been able to peel ice with this guy. I experience mostly heavy frost and this took care of that pretty well until it dulled down (which was fairly quick). I tried breaking up ice as they show in pictures and videos, but nothing worked. The design also makes it impractical to clean the front windshield because it REQUIRES 2 hands to keep good pressure and to stabilize it."
3,Not for short people with tall trucks :),I received this as a gift. It works really well on my car as I can reach the window with no problems. It is hard to use on my truck though because of the angle of the grip. I can't put enough pressure on it to make it remove ice from my truck. It is great for removing the ice off of the wiper blades. I would suggest this for car owners but not for anything taller than your average family car.
3,Not very durable...,"I got one last year, and the blade had chips in it by the end of the year. It still works well but there are gaps that don't get scraped in one swipe. Also the handle isn't very long, so if you are shorter than me (6'2"") you might not be able to scrape your whole windshield."
4,Best when its worst,"I have this and the ice dozer mini. I have to say that the mini works much better for the typical small amounts of frost we get in nj. We just had an ice storm and without this i would not have been able to get into my car or get the windows clear. I couldnt warm up my car and it still did a good job. With the glaze i used a de icer spray, and then scored an x with the corner of the blade. from there the tenderizers worked if i pushed toward the center of the x i made. Works great for the chunky ice after a snowstorm. It beats any little scraper by far for that. I cant imagine if i was able to warm my car up, but besides being encapsulated by ice, i dont like to waste the gas.Pete"
4,IceDozer Just in Time,"This Ice Scraper arrived just before almost 3/8"" of ice was deposited on my car. It handled it easily, also allowing me to sweep the snow. My only wish would be that it was a little longer - my wife hesitates to use it."
4,Removes Ice Quickly,"This product works as advertised, removes the ice quickly. I have used it on a few ocassions so far and has not disappointed."
2,Tricky,This item is difficult and tricky to use. Also heavy to handle.May be good if ice was thick but as a general snow removal/ice removal implement for the vehicle (every day use) not that good.
3,Good but not great,"This device is the best I have used for thick ice, and snow. However it is not good at hard frost. You have to make many passes to get hard thick frost off the windows."
2,Almost Useless,For normal snow and ice this product is not as good as the least expensive windshield ice scrapper you can find at any supermarket.
2,Fake Video,"First off, I don't own one of these and haven't tried it at all. But I watched the video and it's quite apparent that it was faked to mislead the potential customer. The ice in most scenes where the Dozer is being used has obviously been heated from underneath so as to loosen any bonding to the glass. You can see it slide around smoothly with a dampened effect that can only be caused by the presence of a liquid layer. The regular ice scrapers are being used on hard-frozen ice though. Truly a very misleading presentation."
1,dissapointed,did not work very good at all. used it once and my cheapo hand scraper that cost 2 bucks was superior
2,"Good, but not great","Purchased this scraper in December 09. Got to finally use here in Virginia during the blizzard we had in February. It's ok for pushing snow off your car; it pushes great, but it's not long enough to push snow all the way off your windshield or roof. The scraper works as expected, pretty good. The long handle lets you get more leverage for that thick ice. The brush attachment is kind of a pain. It constantly falls off of my scraper when I am using it or the scraper side. Overall, it's a decent scraper if you get it cheap enough, but you could probably do better with a normal hand scraper and a brush."
2,"Only good for ice, not good for snow.","Okay, finally out east where I live we had our first storm. So I took out my new icedozer to try it out. I didnt realized its not wide nor very good for brushing snow off the car. I then used my 99 cent snow scraper to brush off the snow otherwise this icedozer would take me forever. While I tried brushing the snow off the car with the icedozer the brush fell off. I'd snapped it back on with no problem, but is it suppose to come off? For this price I would stay with those cheap snow ice brushes. Ergonomic on this is overrated. Stay with a hand ice scrapper and a snow brush. This is over priced and just a gimmick.Pros1)scrape ice off the door windows.Cons1)expensive2)small brush3)parts may fall offPS. I did use this on my door steps. It works well removing ice/snow.update.. was told brush can be removed, but by me or by itself?"
3,Turn out the Lights,This production from the Geneva is about the most complete version we are likely to find today. It greatly expands the Guiletta act although it leaves out the Diamond aria which was not put there by Offenbach to begin with. The singers and the musical production are very good.The problem is the stage production. Olivier Py locates the opera in Offenbach's time when Paris was the city of lights. So most of the production has hundreds of white lights making up the set. They go on and off and form all sorts of dislays. The set moves quite frequently.The problem is that at least for me I have no idea what is is supposed to mean. It often doesn't serve the opera. And the Antonia act is so dark you can't see the singers. If you want a traditional Hoffman try the ROH with Domingo and directed by John Slessinger. For a more modern touch there is the Paris Opera version which takes place in the Paris Opera House.
5,Lots of music and lots of powerful entertainment,"This is a very sexy, dark, death-ridden conception of this great opera. Also, as others have said, one of the most complete musically, basically following the (somewhat flawed) Oeser edition. The singing is generally very good, the orchestra lively, loud and appropriately driven. I think Olivier Py's dark vision of the work is extremely effective in some parts and a little over-the-top in others (in the Giulietta act, for instance, the sex seems rather aimless and comes, I feel, at the wrong place). But of the 9 DVDs of this opera I own this is certainly at or near the top, partly because it really makes you think about what this fantastic array of stories and songs could possibly mean, both in Offenbach's time and today."
5,Amazing!,"My favorite production of this opera. Olivier Py is a little bit of a genius with his vision of Hoffmann; the clarity of the storytelling is what sets this production above others for me. The nudity is relevant, not gratuitous. The Antonia act is beautiful and breathtaking!"
3,I'm sorry. I just wish they still ROCKED.,"Don't get me wrong. This is a great album. I first heard this band when the Murder City Devils were still together. The New Romance was great. But I was too into the Devils when it came out to care much about them. A couple of months before the Devils broke up ""Hands in the Estuary, Torso in the Lake"" came out and was a little mellow but good. Little did I know that the title track along with ""Chain Snatcher"" were going to be my last bastion of of hope for filling the void created by the dismantling of The Murder City Devils. Dead low tide which was basiclly the ""new"" MCD was great for one (barely got finished) album before they broke up. Black Cat is still Dark enough.....but what if they still ROCKED!!! I'm sorry but this album says sellout to me. I mean ""Matured""."
3,Good product,This door latch fit perfectly in my old door. I will differently buy more for the rest of my doors.
1,yuck,"It didn't work at all, didn't even have a chance to install it in the door. Once we opened the package the tongue did not depress. And since it was purchased for a remodel, it was attempted to be installed until after the return date expired. I will not buy from a independant seller through Amazon again. The shipping to us was super slow and expensive for what this was, and would have been installed when my carpenter was here, had it arrived timely."
3,Two Dollars!,"Park your brain in neutral before you hit the ""play"" button on the VCR and you are in for a hoot of a good time. There are priceless, brainless moments in this movie and John Cusack is utterly endearing. There's not much plot, but it's a non-stop series of laughs."
4,Review Title,"It costs two dollars more for the ""I Love the 80's Edition"" than the other version available on Amazon. I paid that two dollars because I was hoping the money might go to that terrible paper boy. I'm sure he's got some medical bills that need paying. It came with a little CD that has four songs on it. The CD might be nice for people who never heard of the 80's before. But to anyone who actually knows about the 80's, it's all superfluous music. The movie itself still holds up I'd recommend it to anyone looking to spend a while watching some good old fashioned 80's absurdity."
3,"If there's a Blu-Ray edition, let me know!","I love this movie to death and couldn't wait for the DVD! When I got the DVD, I was disappointed much like others who left their review here. The sound is really low and sounds better on VHS and the digital transfer is not that much better. If this flick gets a Blu-Ray treatment, they can't go wrong. When I got the DVD I paid full price (now that I think about it, I'm getting pissed!) A previous reviewer said $12.99, this one says it's should have been 8 bucks flat! You know, ""Weird Science,"" got better treatment on DVD by UNI. Of course, that one did better at the box office than ""Better Off Dead,"" but that shouldn't have anything to do with any official release of home videos (retros included.) They all should have the same quality, to a certain extent. Anyway, if this classic B is mastered to Blu-Ray, somebody get at me because it's worth the wait for sure!!"
5,Better than Dead,This is a great movie. It sums up all those horrible break ups we had in our early years. Definitely give it a shot.
5,ONe of the greatest teen movies of all time.,This movie every kid should see. it was sooo funny and entertaining...one of the best teen movies of the 80s...if you liked ferris bueller you will love this one.
5,The BEST comedy of the 80's!,"Wonderful and funny from the very beginning, this film has it all. There are several great characters: the paperboy, the neighbor, Little Ricky, Monique, the paperboy, the teacher, the owner of ""Pig Burgers"", the Japanese race-car drivers, Roy, and finally: the paperboy. This is the only movie that I've ever seen that was so good and so funny, I actually re-wound it at the end and watched it a second time the first time I rented it. There are several great running gags like Lane's brother building a spaceship (out of household appliances) and the ways Lane keeps trying to commit suicide. Ricky and his Mother steal the show though. This is what a great comedy is supposed to be. Kudos to all involved. It doesn't get any better than this. If only John Cusack could do something this good again..."
4,Cusack classic,"For the two Asians (one of which has learned all the English he knows from Howard Cosell on Wide World of Sports) who constantly drag race Cusack, this flick is worth the price of the video.Of course, it's dumb and stupid, but it's also got so many classic bits the blow-dried '80s hairstyles can be overlooked."
5,Hilarious,John Cusack just represents the typical teenage High Schooler in this movie. When getting dumped it seems like it is the end of the world. Then he meets someone new and the troubles from the first fade away and dont matter any longer. Also- he has a nice classic car!
4,2 dollars,possibly the best John Cusack 80's movie besides Say Anything. this one has great actors and a great story. the animation is funny as hell and Cusack has never been more cooler and better. the kid who tortures him over the 2 dollars sorta wears thin but otherwise its great. highlight would have to be when Cusack is running in the woods from all of those paperboys
2,My favorite movie - disappointed with DVD though,"First off, you have to see this movie. Although it would get awards for being extremely cheezy... it's quite humorous. If you want a movie review, read the excellent posts by Jeffrey Ellis or Joshua Lai.Second, my low rating is based on the actual DVD. I waited, and waited, and waited for this movie to come out on DVD. Considering DVDs have been around more than 5 years already, I'm truly amazed that companies still put out VHS quality works in DVD format. I could have sworn I was watching a videotape (on my HD monitor with progressive scan player). Unless you are a Better Off Dead nut like myself, wait until the studio releases a Collector's edition or Special editor before spending your money on this DVD."
3,Rating For The Blu-Ray Version,"So the last time I saw this movie, I was around 18 or 19 years old (now 44). I remembered it as being much funnier. It's good for a few good laughs, but mostly is just an ""ok"" movie. I'm a big John Cusack fan, so it is still worth having in my collection.Now for the Blu-Ray. I am very disappointed in this Blu-Ray. The sound is awful! I'm no audiophile and I'm not sure how to describe it in words. The dialog just doesn't sound realistic. The best way for me to say it is that they always sound like they are talking in a warehouse (even when they are in a small room like a kitchen or outdoors). This disc also has a ""special features"" option on the menu, but the only thing on the special features is one trailer of the movie!"
5,Best movie of the 80's,"In just a few words....this is without a doubt one of my personal all-time favorite movies. Classic John Cusack, classic story...with a new, off-beat twist."
5,A cult classic movie that goes to show you the 80's rocked,"John Cussack plas a geat role in this flick. It bacically shows that just when you think things can't get any worse, they do. I love the paperboy ""I want my two dollars, and all the failed sucide attempts. If you like this movie and enjoy John Cussack you need to get One Crazy Summer."
4,"Fun, stupid movie","This is a great rainy day movie, in other words: a movie you don't need to think about too much that'll still make you smile. Take care of who you watch it with, however, as you may find yourself embarrassed to be laughing at the dinner slowly crawling off the table or David Ogden Spears being foiled by the paperboy."
2,Better Off Never Made,"I found much of the humour in this movie to be downright silly and stupid. In no way does this movie compare to others in the genre from the same period, such as ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" or ""Sixteen Candles"". Just no comparison. So I'm totally dumbfounded that many of the reviews here speak so highly of it. If what I read is true, Cusack is very much justified in regretting participating in this movie. It's a blemish on what has been a pretty good movie career so far."
2,Sucked,"I liked this a tad more then One Crazy Summer which totally sucked but I was looking for another Say Anything which he was fantastic in! Sure Thing came close but I just threw this in the trash after I was done. Sorry, not my kind of humor. It was embarrassing to think anyone would have to admit to liking it."
1,"Corny, cliche filled and idiotic","I can't begin to tell you what a terrible bomb this is. Every corny, cliche known to man is in this pukey show."
1,Not bad...once.,"When I watched this movie, I have to say, I thought it was pretty pointless. Napolean Dynamite is, too, but it's funny. This isn't quite up to Dynamite standards, I'm afraid. It's not as squeaky clean as good ol' Napolean, either. Don't buy it. If you must see it, rent it."
5,One of the greatest 80's movies ever put on DVD.,If you're looking for great one liners and witty dialogue... this is your movie. Drop what you're doing and buy it now. There are parts of this movie that just pop into your head and make you laugh no matter what you're doing. One of Cusack's best to date.
4,$2.00 WORTH THE PRICE !!!!!,All I can say is I WANT MY TWO DOLLARS $$ That is about how much the cover art is worth !!! A great movie all around real good B film !! It will make you laugh ! LORD KNOWS I DID !!!!
1,"A few good visual gags, and interesting to see John Cusak as a teenager.","Lots of people think this is a hilarious film, and you can't argue with them. If you laugh all theway through a film, then it's a great film. It didn't do it for me, though. I bought itbecause John Cusak is very good in everything he does, and the Leonard Maltin bookgives it a fair rating. It's funny now and then, and some of the visual gags are very funny, butthe writer/director just isn't clever enough when it comes to humor, I'd say. A better writer could havemade this a much better film. But it's interesting to seeJohn Cusak in this early film, when he was a teenager. So I'm glad that I bought it - but I'm not addingit to my film collection."
1,Won't work in any of our DVD playing devices!,"I bought this last year and have not been able to watch it. Apparently, this format isn't made for american DVD players, wii, dvr player or wbox 360. I'm so disappointed as this is my favorite movie! I wanted my kids to watch it. oh well."
3,Good movies,"This movie was fun to watch, but I have to say. It is not the best 80's movie I have or seen. I didn't find it funny when the drawings came alive. I thought that was stupid. But that's just me. Watch it and judge for your self."
5,I was wondering if you wouldn't mind if I took out Beth.......?,"This movie is HIlarious! It gets better every time you watch it. The subtleties are noticable the more times you see it. Cusack is great as a self-depricating wanna-be sucicidal teenager. This is on the list of great cult films.""I've been going to this school for 7 1/2 years, I'm no dummy."""
4,Hilarious Classic,"I don't know how you can't laugh at this movie. A classic, that's it. Story isn't anything special but the scenes are memorable, the lines quotable. You will laugh very hard I guarantee it"
4,BioCam Review,It arrived very quickly and in great shape. I loved the first one so much that I bought a 2nd one for my brother
4,New twists on some older songs,"When you play this album, from the first song onward, you are struck by the nostalgia train of their earlier career. The instrumentation is pristine, though Danny Elfman has a difficult time emulating his older self. While he struggles with the high notes, the ravaging guitar will make you think you're at a heavy metal concert. This album is all-around heavy, and will keep the listeners on the edge of their seats until Only A Lad's coda comes to a halt."
4,A really good live performance,"I enjoy it. Not really much else to say. The people who went to the concert which they knew was the end for Boingo weren't there for the Greatest Quirky Radio Hits Of The '80s!!!, they were there for the songs which made Boingo Boingo, which include absolutely nothing from the generic shlock-fest ""Dark At The End Of The Tunnel."""
3,Another Useless Compilation,"Oingo Boingo had more compilations than any band has a right to and they all suck. Godawful songs like ""Wild Sex In The Working Class"", ""No Spill Blood"", ""Piggies"", ""Sweat"", ""Grey Matter"", ""Little Girls"", ""Insects"", and ""Nasty Habits"" ruin this one along with the necessities and marginal filler. This is one group where choosing the highlights should be easy. OK so you have to choose the overused and rather bland ""Dead Man's Party"", the fun ""Wierd Science"", and classics ""Who Do You Want To Be?"" and ""Only A Lad"". From there you pick ""Nothing Bad Ever Happens To Me"", ""Winning Side"", ""Gratitude"", ""Stay"", ""Just Another Day"", ""No One Lives Forever"", ""Help Me"", ""Only Makes Me Laugh"", ""On The Outside"", ""Wake Up, It's 1984"", and ""Same Man I Was Before"". From the new direction you can choose from ""Where Do All My Friends Go?"", ""My Life"", ""New Generation"", and ""Home Again"" from Boi-Ngo and the first 3 songs and maybe some others from Boingo might be OK to fill out the CD. Easy!!!"
4,Great overview of a genius,"A remarkable book about a remarkable man. I've been mildly obsessed by the Goldberg Variations for years, and Gould's recordings were always the best. It is intriguing to learn about Gould's experiments (and his effect) on radio - especially the idea of vocal counterpoint. The book treats his eccentricities with respect, and a fair bit of medical speculation is done to try and explain his behavior. This is an enjoyable (if too exhaustive in parts) survey of a genius."
2,informative but bad writing,"this book gives us good info about one of 20th centuries greatest aritists but i thought it is not well-constructed. In fact i think its poorly written. i think it is not interesting for someone that knows the essential basic story gould... If this is the best bio of gould, like many reviews are saying, then i won't bother reading the other bios..."
2,Disappointing,I was rather disappointed with this series after viewing another that was fabulous. My fiance and I both felt that there was far too much political talk and not enough spiritual. If you want to learn a little about the religious practice and alot about politics then this is probably for you.
4,"Great boards, they will warp in the dishwasher over time","I agree with the other reviewer. I have four boards that I use for color coding (red for meat, yellow for poultry, green for produce, blue for fish...) My yellow one warped over time in the dishwasher. To be fair, I've had the board for more than a year and it gets a lot of use. But be advised that regular dishwasher use can damage the boards, requiring replacement. I'm going to start handwashing mine as a general rule, and putting them in the dishwasher only when they get thoroughly messy and I think they need to be sterilized."
3,Unimpressed,"I bought this cutting board because of a rave review in Cook's Illustrated magazine. Thinking it would really grip to my counter top, I was rather disappointed in the results. The problem is that the board and especially the suction cups themselves are too rigid. This means that unless your counter is perfectly flat, the board won't grab as well as you'd like. Hopefully someone will figure this out and make a cutting board with flexible suction cups. Until then, this board is only so-so."
2,I would not purchase this item again.,"I would not purchase this item again. After just a couple times in the dishwasher, it warps, and then it loses it's ability to grip the countertop. So the whole purpose of the thing is defeated. If you want to try it out, don't wash it in the dishwasher."
3,Works and works well,"This cutting board works well, it provides a non slip rubber surface that prevents your board from wandering. There are, however, other solutions to this problem. I own a cutting board mat that sits between the counter and the board, it's 1/8"" thick and provides the same functionality - but it can be used on any cutting board. In cooking school, we just placed a wet J-cloth type towel on the counter and the board on top of that. At home, I've used a wet paper towel to do much of the same. So while I like the board, there are many other (cheaper) solutions. The one negative about the board is that the rubber side is harder to clean than a regular board as it is knobbed rubber."
2,Warps after washing in dishwasher,"Not surprisingly, I bought this cutting board due to its non-slip qualities. When I received it, it functioned as promised. However, that changed quickly. As dishwashing the board was safe according to the manufacturer, I placed it in my trusty dishwasher. Unfortunately, the board warped significantly with washing, causing it to bulge towards the back side. Now, it grips my granite countertops worse than regular cutting boards. I am very disappointed."
2,Warping...,"This cutting board has been hand washed only, but is still warping and will not lie flat on the counter. We have another smaller Actiontec cutting board and it has no issues, needless to say I am disappointed in this product."
4,Beware the dishwasher,"This is simply the best cutting board available. It comes in a variety of interesting colors, is made of a sturdy material and has zillions of tiny feet that grip any surface and just won't let go (making it also the safest cutting board I've used). It will last a long time provided you DO NOT put it in the dishwasher. A single washing won't destroy it, but if you continue to wash it in the dishwasher, the gripping feet will be destroyed. I would have given it five stars, but I think the advertising is misleading in stating that it is ""dishwasher encouraged."" If you feel you must put your cutting board in the dishwasher, I'd choose another kind. But really, it's easy to wash yourself and you won't find another as good or as safe as this one."
1,Not as great as touted!,"I had very high hopes for this cutting board due to the recommendations from Cook's Illustrated. It does everything they say EXCEPT it leaves knife cuts easily AND it warps in the dishwasher. I suppose as long as You use dull knives and always hand-wash it, it would be acceptable BUT not at this price! I think you are better off buying a bunch of cheap polypropylene boards and just toss them when they wear out. Also if you put a damp paper towel under a cutting board it grips just as well!"
3,"Decent board, replace yearly.","These aren't bad boards, the downside is they warp within a year, and need to be replaced. I'm still looking for a decent, dishwasher safe, non slip cutting board."
3,warped,This cutting board doesn't slip. It did warp in the dishwasher. It makes no sense to have a cutting board that warps in the dishwasher. I purchased this item from Amazon and it warped after the return period.
5,Best Cutting Board,"I love these cutting boards. I have two large and two small boards in various colors and use them constantly. My oldest one is about 8 years old and it is still in use. I put them in the dishwasher often and haven't found that they warp, although I did buy one that was warped out of the package once. I have to have more than one so that I can have two in use, or in the dishwasher at once. Seriously, at $15.00 each, I am not expecting them to last a lifetime and can afford to own more than one. Highly recommend."
1,Disappointed,"I read through the reviews of this product carefully before buying, and the only common negative was that sometimes dishwashers can warp the board, possibly owing to excessively hot water. Being my own dishwasher, I figured that I was safe and ordered one. Amazon's packaging appeared to be more than adequate, i.e., large box, lots of cushioning, etc., so you can imagine my dismay when I removed the board from its retail cardboard enclosure, placed it on my counter, and it wobbled. In fact, I can spin the board freely on a flat surface despite never immersing it in water of any temperature. This is especially annoying as the price means that I'm now stuck in a situation where return by mail will probably cost as much as ordering another board. I'll probably give it one more try, but I'm disappointed."
1,not what i hoped for,"unfortunately i bought 2 of these. i really wanted a non skid cutting board.i havee granit counters that are perfectly smooth and level. thus, i figured these boards would work. they don't. the boards are not perfectly flat and thus they slide.very disappointed, thank g-d they were not more expensive"
2,Warped in dishwasher,"I bought 3 of these boards in different colors based on the positive reviews and recommendations I was reading about 2 years ago. I was extremely disappointed when each one warped the FIRST time I put it in the dishwasher. Like other reviewers have mentioned, I now have cutting boards that ""rock"" instead of sitting flat. Even worse, the cutting surface is now a bit concave so that I can't easily slice all the way through without having to use an exaggerated sawing motion to make sure the cut goes all the way through to the board. The only reason I didn't give 1 star is because I think these would be very nice if you were willing to hand-wash/sanitize them instead of putting them in the dishwasher. But I definitely won't buy again."
4,Decent,This is a good board but you can't use it in the dishwasher and it doesn't exactly stay still in smooth granite. Your better off buying the thin plastic ones and placing a rubber drawer liner underneath
1,Warped after one run in the dishwasher,"As another reviewer said, ""good unless warped."" I have a largerArchitec Restaurant Gripper 12-by-19-Inch Large Professional Edition Cutting Board, Whiteand it's awesome. This smaller board warped after one run in the dishwasher. The board is useless if warped. Maybe it warped because it is smaller. It's a great board. It works as advertised except for the ""dishwasher safe"" part -- it is clearly not. I'm tryingProgressive International 17.5"" X 11.25"" Cutting Boardwhich is a standard board (put a wet paper towel under it to prevent slippage) and I am hopeful that it is as good as the two small boards that I have now and it won't warp in the dishwasher."
3,Picture doesn't match actual color,My only complaint making me return the cutting board was the color on the website looks turquoise but it is the color of Crayola #14 blue gray.
4,Goob cutting board,"Grips well to my granite counter top,I don't wash it in dishwasher always by hand so I cannot comment on some other issues,yes I would buy it again"
3,Gripper cutting board works well for the first year or so,"I use the energy saver option on my dishwasher and let the dishes air dry, so the issue other people have with it melting is not an issue for me. Very happy with my purchase. It has a handhold cut into it and that is very nice too.It's now March of 2010 and for the last 6 months at least, this cutting board has been warped and doesn't lay flat on the counter anymore. I still use it, but it is decidedly warped and moves sometimes when I use it. I never used the dryer on the dishwasher."
3,GRIPPER CUTTING BOARD,I THOUGHT IT WOULD MATCH OUR TURQUIOSE BUT IT DIDN'T. IT IS A FIND CUTTING BOARD. AND IT DOES NOT SLIP LIKE IT SAYS
4,dur-able,"I bought this for its look, but am finding it's more than meets the eye. The grips on the back of this board are great. and the board is very thick, which makes for a really sturdy cutting surface."
2,Too much flexibility,"This saw is a step up from my old black and decker, and the saw has plenty of power. But...the sole plate connection is way too flexible. It is only connected to the body of the saw by a piece of plastic housing that is about an inch wide. As I made a few test cuts the saw would not keep a 90 degree angle. The connection would flex and I would end up with a cut that was beveled 2 or 3 degrees. To me that is unacceptable for a tool costing this much. I'm taking this saw back and see if I can trade it in for the DW364."
3,No brake despite what Amazon says,"I bought this saw instead of the comparable Hitachi because it was a bit lighter and more powerfull. The product details said it has an electric brake, an essential safety feature in my opinion, but it DOES NOT! I will be returning mine and purchasing another, but not from Amazon."
2,incohesive hodgepodge,The album is an extremely diverse but unfinished collection of tidbits of songs. Most tracks could have been improved with some added melodies and less of a slap on the knee attitude. Do not expect the former School of Fish frontman to follow his earlier format.
3,Uninteresting Nature Boy,"It's tragic that the guy is dead, but it doesn't make his music any more interesting."
1,Hack and Slash Desecration,"I had high hopes for this novel, since it continues the story of the ""ethical thief"" created by Shirley Meier in Shadow's Daughter. Shadow's Daughter portrayed the development and maturation of Megan Whitlock, a girl making the best of her life when trapped by poverty and subject to the whims of uncaring royalty. However, Saber & Shadow takes a complex character and turns her into a typical moral-free warrior, gleefully maiming or murdering every innocent that crosses her path. This book creates an adventure story interchangeable with that of hundreds of others, composed primarily of bloody chases, ""political maneuvering"" notable only for its unreadability, and enemies who could have stepped right out of the pages of an ""Encyclopedia of Fantasy bad guys."" I would classify this book as yet another example of why talented writers should not turn their creations over to authors unable to measure up."
4,A Legend In His Own Time.,"On CBS Sunday Morning, I learned that it is not 'hip' to be a Neil Diamond fan, and never has been. He claims to be the original 'outsider' (Rodney Crowell is the newest one), and likes it that way. We wandered back to the little dumpy club in New York where he got his start at $50 a night performance.The summer I visited my son's 'family' in Chicago, he asked if I liked Neil Diamond and was surprised when I admitted that I do. My introduction to this incredible songwriter was the movie, 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' and then along came his rendition of 'The Jazz Singer,' which I loved. Now, he has out a new CD, 'Twelve Songs' with the way he sounds today -- not much different from the early years. I missed his rock songs as I was never into the rock music scene with the drugs and confusion. My music of choice was pop with the baritone Eddie Fisher. Neil still has his melodious baritone (though strained) sounds and is as good now as he was forty years ago."
2,So upset!,This album is not the original (although the jacket looks the same). I wanted the same album with the same music that I had back in the 70's and it has been reworked. Different songs. Some are the same but not many. I was so upset. If they are going to rework an album - it should be clearly stated somewhere on the cover or in the listing.
5,A Modern Concerto,"This may be my all time favorite album. I originally had the vinyl which is now replaced by a CD. This is beautiful music to listen to on many occasions, particularly the old ""side 2"". The musical themes cycle through the whole album and reappear under haunting and different circumstances. If you like the way classical composers weave in and out of different mucical themes and instrumentation, you'll love Neil Diamond's explorations of several patterns in this album. Some seem based upon African music which I generally don't appreciate. But this album is an exception. I think the greatest appreciation of it comes from listening to the whole thing at once. It'll give you goosebumps."
4,Back in time,This was a reorder of one of my favorite ND albums. Every ND fan should have this album in their collection.
1,Warning.,"These pull ups caused my daughters ""girl parts"" to burn and become red. They caused major irritation. In the area. She has never had a problem with sensitive skin. I urge other mothers to use with caution."
3,"Haven't Even Used Yet, But...","Before I opened the box I was overcome by fragrance from these diapers. RIDICULOUS. There could at least be a message on the box that these diapers are fragranced. What is the need for fragrance on a child's diapers? Especially this overwhelming. Secondly, I noticed that the color of the dye is just too deep. Kids don't need all this stuff on their skin. I was just looking for good ole plain training pants... I was fair and gave a three since they do feel ultra soft and we haven't used them yet, but so far I'm already disappointed with Pampers."
2,not for us!,these do not fit the weight that they say they do. the also smell kinda strange. a little less expensive than huggies but huggies are WAY better!
5,great for our girl,"We switched from huggies to pampers for our second baby. These seem less bulky and softer than other products like these. We started using these when our petite sized toddler was about 2 1/2. If you have a good sized toddler, one that may be a little higher on the charts you might want to go up a size. We haven't had any leaks, but for us they were not a good training tool, they absorb too much like a diaper so she didn't care that she was wet. Going to underwear was much quicker for getting her to realize the wet feeling and go to the potty. We still use these at night so if she does get up in the middle of the night she can get them up and down easier. All in all a good back up for avoiding cleanup of accidents and nap/night time messes with a slim and soft fit."
3,Nice but...,"These are softer than Huggies Pullups, but come off way too easy and I wish that these could open on the sides like Huggies."
4,good quality,it is nice and thick. i did not give 5 star because you can't open this diaper from both sides.
2,Why are these scented?,"I bought these because I wanted to toilet train my daughter and she could pull them up and down. However, they are scented and are waaaay too perfumed! I don't know why they felt the need to add artificial scent to these, but I won't be buying them again."
1,"These work for dryness, but the baby powder inside irritated my child's bottom.","I got these pullups for my two-year-old. They work with respect to dryness. But these pullups have baby powder in them, and that irritated my child's bottom. The irritation got more and more red before I finally realized what was causing it: the baby powder. So I threw the rest of these pullups away, used some hydrocortizone and Vaseline (as recommended by our peditrician), and her bottom cleared right up. Even though these pullups were cheaper that some, I will not buy them again."
4,Great deal,"Great deal! My daughter loves them. I only gave it 4 stars because I think it needs reclosable sides for when your in public places and it's a hassle to remove all the clothing and shoes to put on a pull up. Otherwise, they do the job and are cute."
2,Good value but STINKY PERFUME,"Amazon offers an excellent price for this product. However, the pull-ups were so heavily perfumed (powder scent) when they arrived that I had to send them back. I previously bought these at a local store and they were not so smelly. I don't know what Pampers has done to ""improve"" this product but the smell is over the top. If your child has any skin sensitivity whatsoever I would avoid this product."
4,Pampers Easy Ups,I purchased these training pants for my daughter and they sure have helped me a lot in potty training her .They are easy to use and my daughter loves the dora designs.
3,StillTryingToPottyTrain,"Love the Dora print and hearts, flowers, etc., that disappear if there is a potty miss. But wish they had reusable sides like the Huggies."
3,Strong scent,"I ordered these to try for my 20 month old.... and the price was right. They are very strongly scented. I ordered the 3-4T for my daughter that normally wears a 2-3T in Huggies pull ups. They have not leaked on us, and they do not have the velcro on the sides...which is great cause our daughter removes her diapers all the time."
2,too small for my 2 year old,"I used size 5 and 6 on my 2 year old daugher before they removed the size and put age on the box instead. So I thought my 2 year old should be able to use 2T-3T, it says up to 36 lbs. My daughter just turned 2 years old and she is about 20 lbs (she is a little small compared to other kids this age). When I opened the box I couldn't believe my eyes - it says size 4 on the back of each diaper! It's too small for my little one!"
4,Good product,"Amazon does take a week or two to deliver these diapers, but I find that is great that they carry it, since my local Target doesn't always have this size and I have them delivered to my door with no shipping charges.I really like these diapers and they seem to be really comfortable. They are very absorbent and looks like she's not wearing a diaper. I give it four stars because I wish there was a size larger than 6, since this seems to be almost the same size as pull ups 4/5."
3,good for the price,"the only reason i decided to buy this product was because i got more my money with these pull-ups. i prefer huggies pull-ups instead. but, these work just fine."
3,GREAT for DORA lovers!,My 2yr old daughter is obsessed with Dora and loves her pull-ups. I recently ran out and she would not wear her diaper because she wanted her pull up. It has slightly helped in the potty training scene. They aren't as great as a diaper with leaks but I consider this a jump start to potty training and I work around it by putting my daughter in diaper before bed. I love Pampers and must admit I have been trapped into the gimmick of Dora just to please my 2 year old!!P.S. AMAZON Moms Program and subscribe and save ROCK! I not only save tons of money but they come to my door in 2 days. I don't know about other parents but taking my toddler into a Walmart or Target is just not fun so thank you AMAZON.
2,Only for narrow butts...,"I bought these because they are slightly cheaper than Huggies Pull-Ups, but I'll just have to pay a couple extra bucks for the Pull-Ups because these things are leaky. My 2 year old little girl is pretty big for her size (in the 95% for both height and weight) so I bought size 5, but these things do not fit her bottom. They are constantly off-kilter and leak in the back where they are supposed to go around her cheeks. If your child is narrow in the behind these may work for you, but if she carries a little junk in the trunk be ready for a leaky mess!"
2,Maybe good for some but not for us,"I purchased the Pampers EasyUps because I have always been very pleased with Pampers products. They are generally the ""Cadillac"" of diapers. These diapers fit my daughter great and were easy for her to pull up and down; however, since we are in the beginning stages of potty training, she had regular ""accidents"". She did not always report that she was wet and if she sat in a wet diaper for more than a few minutes she would start to get very red and her skin would become sensitive to touch. After several days of use, my daughter ended up with a red, bleeding bottom. It was dramatic for her. I would just say watch your kiddo's skin closely for a reaction so it doesn't get too bad if your child is sensitive to these diapers."
4,Pretty Good,"I have always liked this product for the most part. The characters are enjoyed by my daughter and she likes the independence of being able to take them on and off. However, my only complaint is that they tend to ""ride up"" on her, leaving her partly exposed and unprotected."
3,not what I thought,"I like the product but am dissapointed that the sides are not velcro, purchased for preschool only to find out the first day that i cant use them. I will save them for night time and home. But I wish i would have known they didnt have velco sides before I purchased them."
4,work for us,The only problem is sometimes when I pull them up the sides rip a little but I can see that could happen with any pull ups. Besides that they are good.
1,so small as size six,Baby dry size five is better than this one. It so small that my daughter she felt so uncomfortale though she is so tiny. She is only 26 months old. I wont recommend it to others.
4,Does the job well,These Pamper pull-ups are constructed well and are strong enough to handle mistakes. There were a few pullups in the box that had their sides torn which was bothersome but overall they did there job well.
5,Great training pants for a great price,"They are a great price and never leaked, my daughter never complained about discomfort, they seem pretty flexible. If there are any complaints to make it would be the Dora design (we aren't huge Dora fans) and the tearable-sides (Pullups have velcro-esque sides), but they work fine and it's not anything to knock a star off the rating for. The important things are the comfort and durability - Easy Ups work great in these departments."
4,perfect for our daughter,"Our 2 year old daughter is not quite potty trained, so the Easy Ups are perfect for her. They hold up to her rough and tough playing, and most importantly to her little (or not so little) accidents!"
2,Size is way off,"I ordered the 2T/3T which is what my daughter had before. These came in a size 4 (2t/3t), not even sure why. These are huge on her and she won't be able to wear them for a long time. I'm going to have to switch to Huggies since these don't come in a smaller size."
4,Great price,"Good product. Great price. I wish it had a wetness gauge, however. That would make the product 5 stars for me."
1,2t/3t pampers easy ups,I've been using these for less than a week. We just started potty training our 2 yr old. She was in huggies pull ups but we switched just to try something different. Well were going to be switching back. She started to complain that her pee pee hurt and she wouldn't even let me touch her. She looks red and irritated and keeps holding herself. So we went back to pull ups and she's been fine. Not sure if it's the blue cooling strip that has irritated her or what. We've always used pampers and have loved them. Not this time.
1,Feel and Learn liner is horrible!!,"I love the softness and design of these compared to huggies pull ups. However, the feel and learn wetness liner is horrible! My daughter got a terrible terrible rash from whatever chemical is on the liner. If they made these without the feel and learn liner I would love them. She wasn't wet for more than 10 minutes in the pull up and the rash was instant. It was almost like a chemical burn.If your child is sensitive beware!"
3,"Good for nights, too bulky for days",These are good for night use to get away from the actual diapers but they are much more bulky and diaper-like than the leading rival brand; in fact I sometimes have a hard time telling whether the kiddo is actually wet or if it's just the bulk of the padding. Under leggings or tights it looks like she's still wearing an actual diaper and it seems like she's not as comfortable walking and running in these. I'd recommend these for night times because so far they've been leakproof but I'll stick with the others for days.
3,Could be better.,"These don't have tabs on the sides that allow you to take them off without pulling them down. So if my daughter has a #2 accident, you have to rip them or pull them down which isn't always an option. They have also leaked a couple of times. I will not be buying these again."
5,Good pull ups,These work well. I haven't really been using them as a potty training diaper but more for when we are out & there's no place to change her...these pull ups are very easy for on-the-go changing.Work well & fit my daughter nicely. She normally wears a size 4 pampers. Not good for overnight because they don't hold a ton but good for daytime wearing.I'd buy them again
3,"Great quanity, bad quality","I used pampers pullups for a month. I loved how many you got for the price, but the quality of the pullups were aweful. They are hard to open on the side unlike Huggies brand, and there's no way to put them back together if needed. However the shipping was fast. I love amazon's prices and will be using them again on another type of pullups.Pampers Easy Ups Trainers for Boys Value Pack, Size 2T/3T, 108 Count"
3,Do the job but sometimes saggy and can be hard to put on,"I love Pampers and they have fit my daughter better than Huggies, but I do like how Huggies Pull-Ups have the side tabs that open for easy on and off. Having my own daughter and working at a day care, those tabs can be invaluable with a struggling or fussy child. We tried these thinking we might potty train soon, but I had difficulty at times pulling them up and on so I am not sure how a little one would be able to do it. Also they sagged a lot when full, even sliding down her bottom, and she wears size 4 which is equivalent to 2T/3T Easy Trainers. Otherwise they got the job done and she didn't seem to mind."
3,Sizes not right.,"The 3t/4t size is supposedly a size 5, but this is not true. These did not fit my daughter who has been wearing a size 5. I returned theses and got the next size up, Size 6 4t/5t, which fits just fine. Why are these labeled 3t/4t but it says its a 5 when you order? How about label it with the actual proper size."
5,Way better than target brand,"Bought the target brand pull ups first and they were ok, but had to size up since we had leaks at night. Decided to try these since they ate the same price with amazon mom discount and subscribe and save. These are WAY better. They fit nicer and are super soft. They don't have Velcro on the sides, like target, which is good since they would come apart as my daighter would try and put them on."
3,An Okay Trainer,"These are good for toddlers that are a little farther along in the potty training experience. I had bought these for my daughter when we decided to start potty training her because we figured they would be a lot easier to take off and put on than a regular diaper, which they are. The only problem was, when she peed in the diaper, it would sag and fall down. There were several times that we would be at the store and her diaper and pants would fall down because she went in her diaper and not the potty."
3,At least they don't leak,"The design for these things doesn't really fit like a diaper. The sides do not open like the Huggies pull ups, but I really dislike the Huggies Pull Ups. These don't leak, even after my daughter pees in them all night. We've been using these for way too long and they work well. I do wish they were easier to get up and down, it's almost impossible to get them up and down, so my daughter can't do it on her own."
3,Ok....,"I really liked the price on these, BUT they have leaked ten times more than the actual pullups. I have since switched back to them despite the increase in price."
3,pretty good but easy to rip,"These pullups work well for us as overnight protection for a potty trained preschooler. They fit well, absorb moisture well in case of an early morning accident, and my daughter loves that she can choose from two designs each night. The down side is the sides rip easily when pulling them up. Just a little too much oomph in the pull and they pull apart. And they have a strong scent, which doesn't bother my daughter but I'm not a fan of."
3,Good quality but strong odor!,"The material is good, soft and stretchy, waist line is not too high. The price is great! However, it has a strong odor or perfume that really makes me feel sick."
5,Great for overnight,"I prefer these over the Huggies equivalent, they work great, never had any leaks, and we only use them for bedtime for my 3 year old who is otherwise fully pottytrained."
2,too small,"Just started potty training for my 19 month old, i bought the 2T/3T or size 4 and this is too small. She is not too fat or anything, very average at 50 percentile. they get stuck just above her knees and i have torn a couple of these already trying to pull these up. going for the next size now."
2,Not resealable on the sides,"Huggies allow you to open and reseal on the sides -- not so with these. You can tear open the sides (to change a poop), but they're not going back on. That was a deal breaker."
4,"Work fine, sizing a bit small.","These diapers work fine, we haven't had leaks or rashes. The size seems a bit small - have size 5 for my 30 pound 2 year old. She is tall and thin and these are on the small size - I don't think they would fit a 3t/4t 35+ pound toddler very well."
5,Love these Pull-ups! Great for night time.,"My daughter needs pull ups for night and these work just great. No leaks, easy to pull on, and she loves that they have Dora. She loves guessing each night if it will have Boots or not. The little stinker figured out quick that the Dora with boots has a different dress on."
1,Heavily scented,"We've used Pampers since birth and have been very satisfied. However, when we opened our first box of pull-ups we were disappointed to find that they were heavily scented! Nowhere in the product description or on the box does it state that they are scented. They're going back."
5,I love them!!,"My daughter is 2 years old and has it in her mind that she's a big girl now. She refuses to wear regular diapers since they are for babies. She loves these pants. Although she doesn't have the potty training down yet, these pants have never leaked. She even wears them to bed. I would suggest these to anyone."
1,Don't waste your Money on Pampers,"I use huggies 2t-3t but I was short on cash so I found this brand on sale and got this for our 3 yr old and next morning she broke out in rash that was so bad, the diaper rash cream couldn't handle. I had to take my girl to the doctors office and they had to treat her with other medication, and it took a week to get rid of the rash. I would not recommend this brand to anyone even if it cost a penny.Don't waste your dollars on this brand of pull-ups.give your child the best pull-ups there is (Huggies)Good Luck in Potty training."
5,the best in market,"Pampers diaper are the best in market and 10 times better than any other competitors...the absorption is really great, comfortable for babys, good grip, durable waist bands...do not buy any other brands for pull-ups..."
4,"Great for 12 month olds, but perfumed","The size 4 fit great on my 19-pound 12 month old. It's the only disposable trainers I could find in her size. She's not yet walking but I tell her to ""stand up"" and she holds onto me and I can easily pull these up and down. They haven't ripped and they hold a few pees.They don't hold as much as a diaper though. For her early stage of training, I'd love to find a pull-up type of diaper rather than a trainer but these encourage me to be more on top of her training which is good. However for long car trips, diapers are more worry-free. NOT absorbent enough for overnight.My main complaint is that they STINK of perfume. My daughter doesn't poop in her diaper, but even if she did I wouldn't want to not be able to smell it and not know when to change her. The perfume is just yucky."
3,easy ups,Diapers are not as absorbent for accidents and rip after second or third time pulling it up. The Easy ups part is not that great of a title. I should of stick to huggies pull ups.
2,Just like a diaper,"These are a waste of time and money if you are truly trying to pottytrain. Only benefit is you do not have to lie your child down to put them on like a diaper, otherwise, they are just a diaper only more bulky. My daughter would see no difference between these and a diaper so she would simply wet in them and continue on. You can't even roll them up in a small ball to dispose like a regular diaper. I used them a few days then switched to regular underwear and old school rubber pants. My daughter is now trained. I bought these despite my gut feeling that they were just a marketing ploy but will not be buying them again when our second baby starts training."
5,Easy to use,"These trainers are easy to pull up, are very absorbent, and are the only commercial brand my granddaughter can wear without breaking out in a rash."
1,greeting card doggerel,"This books mixes the kind of gardening advice you could get from the most superficial coffee-table gardening book, with singsong rhymes the likes of which are found in mainstream greeting cards. Is the author sincere about her status as high priestess, or is she laughing all the way to the bank? We may never know, but if you like bad writing you will get some utility from the book. My favorite part was where she advises putting a small statue of the Goddess into your Goddess garden, because it makes ""an excellent Goddess symbol"". (Used copy for sale!)"
5,Now THIS is what I've been looking for!,"I cannot state this frankly enough - Dorothy is one AMAZING lady; who has finally written the book I've been looking for. A great, fun read - full of magic, inspiration and education. If the goal is to entertain and inform, she has done it with grace and style - even making me EXTREMELY late for my moving date. I've read quite a few books regarding herbology, magickal herb use and natural home remedies - *nothing* has come close to this. Simply put, I can't wait for my ground to thaw - I've already bought some new herbs and plants for my apartment! Thanks Dorothy for the inspiration."
5,"Once again, a well written book with magic abound!","Once again, I have found complete trust, and magic in a book by this author. Dorothy Morrison has been an inspiration in all my magickal workings and now she takes me to the garden. D.M. has shown me that magick can be simple and still effective while planting my herbs. I am fairly new to this aspect and this book has brought me right up to par. Anyone who plans to garden and bless their gardens with a pagan flavor, this is THE BOOK! Very well written as always from Morrison and made so I can enjoy as well as learn from it. I would tell anyone interested in pagan gardening to buy a copy of this book. Most excellent. Oceana at the Realm"
1,Not for Architects!,"Having ordered (and returned) the book i have to say, that this book is not at all a helpful handbook for architects planning in hot and humid climates. The book shows a lot of black&white photographs of buildings all over the world that should not be taken as great contemporary examples for tropical architecture. the book shows briefly and only the very basic principles of designing with climate, that are found better and cheaper in other books. in the last years there has been great new architecture in hot and humid climate that uses basic architectural methods as well as high-tech-installations. there's not one single building in this book..."
5,AWESOME VIDEO!!! - YOU GOTTAHAVIT!!!,"When I picked this up I was surprised at how excellent this was. A stripped down Transcendental Blues LIVE!! In todays terms it would be considered nearly ""UNPLUGGED""I prefer the real deal over over-dubs and cover-ups.Something you see on just about ALL live videos these days.Meet Steve Earle - the real deal - live and uncut.It isn't as country as the earlier Earle, but it has essence.This was a time when he was picking up new fans and releasing his best stuff ever.Engage yourself with a true artist!Highly Recommended!"
3,"Not great, but not bad.","While I agree with those who posted that the performance is phoned in lets get one thing straight, Steve Earle phoned in is a whole lot better than anything you will hear on Top 40 or Country Radio these days. And, my kids like it!"
2,A Steve Earle Fan,"I am a Steve Earle fan.This DVD is a poor example of Steve Earle, his talent and his music. Not only is the four man band not representative of the music on the ""Tanscendental Blues"" audio disk but it is not representative of the man and his music. At the very least there should have been someone working a sound board to balance the music with the vocals. Earle's music is powerful but if you can't here the lyrics it is a waste of your money and mine. You can't here his wonderful lyrics on many of the cuts on this DVD.One example: The song ""Copperhead Road"" on the audio disk --live at the Bluebird Cafe-- with acustic guitars is superior to the version done with the combo on this DVD. I was really looking forward to hearing this song done electrified with his combo. I'm Disappointed. Hope future live DVD will be professionally recorded."
2,Don't Bother,"Staring Steve's bald spot and comb-over (the camera angles are very unflattering) Steve and company run through mundane versions of a mundane selection of songs. I've seen Steve play great high energy shows and seen shows where he's phoning it in; this is one of the latter. If you have all Steve's records and still feel like you need more Steve, buy the book (""Life and Near Death""), an intertaining little book as far as rock bio's go."
4,It can possess you; you should possess it.,"Patti Griffin's voice aches in you and soars in you at the same time. Her songs are incredible, lyrically, musically, and spiritually. I recently went through a divorce and can't imagine having gotten through it without this CD and Dylan's ""Blood on the Tracks"". Her lyrics are not as accomplished as those on Dylan's masterpiece, but please construe my faint damnation as praise, and note that Dylan doesn't have her voice. Her live performances are also captivating and extremely powerful, both the acoustic and the electric shows."
4,Patty Griffin,"On some tracks on this album, ""Living With Ghosts,"" Griffin is just too intense for my ""mature"" ear. But I had to have the album nonetheless for the track, ""Let Him Fly,"" which I cannot get enough of!"
5,Patty Griffin is Amazing as Always,"Patty never ceases to amaze me. If you have not picked up this CD, Flaming Red, and 1000 Kisses, you need to do it today. I listen to these CD's over and over and will never get tired of them."
5,Stabs-you-straight-in-the-heart,"Griffin's voice is amazingly strong and filled with intense emotion. Her lyrics are clear, honest, and real and she has a remarkable way of putting a story to music. Check out ""Moses,"" ""Every Little Bit,"" ""Poor Man's House,"" and ""Sweet Lorraine."" Better still, she's just as raw on stage as on the CD."
5,shoulda sold a billion,not a big smash thanks to radio being clueless. if i had to categorize her i'd say she's somewhat like bonnie raitt without the slide or backup and a smoother voice. alls i can say is click and listen to any of the songs and if you arent hooked well im sure there may be a few brittany spears discs left out there for you.
5,I cannot say enough about this CD,"Normally I wouldn't take the time to write a CD review but for this one, it's worth it. Thank goodness I bought the Lilith Fair CD which features Patty singing ""Cain"" or I would not know her music today. I am a musician, and ""Living With Ghosts"" is probably in my top five favorite CDs. Patty's voice is ethereal and her songwriting is worthy of endless praise. I had the pleasure of seeing her in concert with Emmylou Harris and she is as good live as she is on the recording. I'd have to say that I am in love with most of the songs on this CD but most notable are ""Moses"", ""Every Little Bit"", ""Sweet Lorraine"", ""Mad Mission"" and ""You are Not Alone"". To hear her sing is like looking into my own soul. It is as if I wrote the songs myself. I highly recommend ""Living With Ghosts"" to anyone who appreciates high quality, solid, sincere songwriting and multi-faceted female folk singers. Patty is a little bit country, a little bit rock and roll. Run, do not walk, to buy this CD."
5,Spare and Special,"The mental image I instantly get when I put on this CD is of the artist, sitting alone on a darkened stage with her guitar, a single spotlight focused on her while she plays. That's the kind of intimate performance that fills this this album. Patty Griffin is an enormously talented woman who is undeservedly almost unknown - I'd describe her sound as a cross between Bonnie Raitt and Emmy Lou Harris. Some of the best tracks are ""Let Him Fly"" (covered recently by the Dixie Chicks, I think), ""Every Little Bit"" (a heartbreaking song about a damaged love affair), and ""Mad Mission"" (kind of an odd little song, but with undeniable charm). The closing track, ""Not Alone,"" is as sad and beautiful as anything I've ever heard. If you love live performances - well, here's a studio recording that has the feeling of one. It's as if she's playing only for you."
5,most beautifully moving record I have found in the 90's,"This cd is a rare bird. Emotional and honest. Stripped to the bone and poetically beautiful. Slightly country folk feel but don't let that stop you as this record is REAL. How many artists can you think of that can carry an entire 40 minute album with only an acoustic guitar? Of course she has such an amazing voice she could perform WITHOUT a guitar! She will pierce your soul with the first track 'MOSES' and rip your heart out with 'EVERY LITTLE BIT'. The 7th track 'FORGIVENESS' is in my opinion one the most beautiful songs ever written. It moves me everytime I hear it. I put it up there with the Stones 'Wild Horses'. She is an artist for the 90's, with the capability to help bridge the gap between country, folk and mainstream rock. If we let her! Give this record a listen, and you'll thank me for it. Also check out 'SCOTT THOMAS BAND - CALIFORNIA'."
5,Reminds me of Bonnie Raitt and Sean Colvin,"I love this CD. I play it over and over, especially when I need a good cry. She is an exceptional talent and it is a pity we don't see more of her."
4,sparce and beautiful,"I first heard patty griffin on the lillith fair album and was impressed by the way she sang on the stage. However, I put off buying one of her albums for a long time. I'm happy to say that ""Living with Ghosts"", is one of the best albums in my whole collection. Her simple songs, simple guitar playing, offset her heartfelt vocals with stunning beauty. One song that sticks out on this album is ""Every Little Bit"", with it's powerful chorus and almost whispering verses shows the range in emotions that this ablum touches on. Defently this album is a hidden gem and patty griffin is one of the most underatted singers in the 90's."
4,A gal and her guitar,"I bought ""1000 Kisses"" first, and I gotta say, I like this recording more. It's like Patty is sitting in my living room, wailing and playing her guitar. I'm very impressed and jealous, because when I'm sitting in my living room wailing along with her, I just don't sound nearly as good."
5,as good as it gets,"an absolute classic, must-have in the acoustic alterna-folk category (OK I just made that up). Patty's got an amazing voice, and the song craftsmanship is really noteworthy. To get a taste of the best songs, sample Moses, Sweet Lorraine, Every Little Bit, and Poor Man's House. Then buy it. No, buy two. You'll want one for your car."
5,"Got to the party late, but I'm never leaving. . .","I'd never heard of Patty Griffin until about a year ago when I was crossing the Bay Bridge late one Northern California night and ""Every Little Bit"" came on the radio. This memory always reminds me of the first time I heard Jeff Buckley. There are some artists who defy description and become a part your consciousness and Patty Griffin is one of them.I went on to buy all of her CD's but this one is my favorite. There are no distractions, just a guitar and that voice. Nothing else is needed.With a huge CD collection, I am often told that there is NO WAY I could possibly listen to all of the music I have collected over the years and I will admit there are a few I listened to once or twice and never went back to again - Living With Ghosts would not be one of those CD's. It is a masterpiece, a wonderful surprise. No one who truly loves music should be without it."
3,Not bad ... but a little sparse,"First off let me state that I am a Patty Griffin fan. Her ""Flaming Red"" disc blew me away and continues to be one of my favorites. With that stated however, I found ""Living with Ghosts"" to be rather sparse and simple. Not bad, mind you -- but I guess I expected more. ""Rain"" is a great track, but there seems to be very little diversity and range on the disc, which is why I give it 3 stars."
2,Kept getting it as a recommendation....,"So I finally bought it and found out that on at least one song, she yells! That is not signing. Some of the other songs sound OK, but that yelling song grates on my nerves and is making it hard for me to be objective. Singers shouldn't have to scream."
5,My all-time favorite.,"This is the one cd that I have given to everyone I know, at one time or another. I have been through a few copies myself. I love every cd of Patty, but this is the one that made me fall in love with her music long before the others. I would listen to it over and over, yet I still to this day, have never gotten tired of listening to every song on it. Back when it first came out I could catch her performing at little venues or opening for various artists, but now Patty is the main event and rightly so. This may not be the first cd someone purchases by her, but it should be in the collection, because....to me...it is the best. I don't mean the best just of Patty's recordings, but of all the albums I have ever owned, this is my ""must-have"" pick."
4,"Great songs, but she can and has done better","Deserves 4 stars purely for the quality of the songwriting. Moses, Let Him Fly, Poor Man's House, Lorraine and Every Little Bit are all great songs, but once you've seen Patty live and heard 1000 Kisses, you realize how much is lacking on Living With Ghosts. These are demos and great ones. I'd love to hear the CD she recorded that the label rejected. I also felt her singing was strained at times. She is an incredible vocalist and you get glimpses of that on this CD, but only glimpses. If you want to hear her voice in perfect form and accompanied by a great band without a note out of place, buy 1000 Kisses.Of course, after you do that you'll be so obsessed with her, you'll buy this one too. Essential listening, but I'd like to hear her rerecord this CD with the players who she made 1000 Kisses with, particularly Doug Lancio."
5,This CD has been in constant rotation in my player since '96,"BUY LIVING WITH GHOSTS AND FLAMING RED! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! First of all, don't listen to anyone who says that Flaming Red isn't amazing. It's spectacular! Second, what more can I say about Living With Ghosts that has not already been said. Everything she does is pure poetry. It's one of the best CDs ever. Not Alone is my favorite song of all time. Forfgiveness will move you to tears. Every Little Bit is SO powerful. I had the honor of meeting Patty after a small concert in Hampton, VA. She is an amazing woman, so gracious. She and her band (great musicians) put on a show that exceeds any and all expectations. Patty, THANK YOU for the unparalleled beauty that is your music. Please, come back to Virginia. I can't wait to hear Silver Bell."
2,Not the best I've had,"These little guys are OKAY at best.They're not awful, but they weren't really what I was looking for. Certainly NOT the kind of sardines I'd devour in one sitting...in fact, I had to force myself to come back to the can and finish it so it wouldn't go to waste.As soon as they came, I opened 1 can and ate it. The first thought I had about it was, ""where's the flavor?"" and then as I ate more and more of it, buyer's remorse crept in as I knew I couldn't return these and I was stuck with 23 more cans of it.So, I was pretty disappointed with the flavor, or lack thereof and will probably stick to getting the King Oscar kind."
2,poor quality of product --great customer service,"We have ordered this item before and have been quite pleased. This time, the product quality was lousy! Sardines were very hard and had a funny taste. Amazon quickly refunded the cost without any hassles. This is why we do business with this company, great customer service.We will order this product one more time via Amazon hoping it was just a bad canning job on the last order."
1,awful!,"These were dry and disgusting and since they wont let me return it, I am forced to throw it all out."
1,K.O. sardines packed in Poland; Bumble Bee distributor,"No longer does the KO sardine label brag about brislings from the icy Norwegian fjords. This inferior sardine is being sold at the premium price of yesteryear in a KO label. In fact, I have read the labels of every brisling sardine fishery on my grocer's shelf, and found them all wanting. Perhaps the near-arctic waters' brislings have been depleted...or the fisheries don't want to spend the money on the diesel fuel to get them there?"
2,Stiff. Not much flavor.,"My most recent sardine order was for 3 types of sardine.This type came in third place.It may be because they are ""wood smoked"" that they seem dry and stiff. There are more flavorful sardines. I won't get these again.Sardines include skin and bones (This was what I wanted.)"
3,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews I ordered a case, but was disappointed. The taste was much more bland than I had expected, lacking the tinge of tartness I had come to expect with smaller, more expensive sardines."
5,Excellent product,"These sardines are top quality. They are small, beautifully packed, with a nice light smokey flavor. The olive oil packing liquid adds nicely to the flavor. It's certainly worth the premium price."
2,Cracked hinge,"I have had the same problem as described above, cracks develop above the hinges and eventually the screen falls off. It does not happen until the warranty is expired."
3,Over heating status and freezing of the windows.,"The presario 700 is a very good PC for business and home use but with two problems so far I relise that when I am playing games or running 3D programmes the PC freezes up.ALso Over heating is a big problem you need a portable fan at all times, the bois programme is not helping at all.Also the battery life is to short.I think compaq should try tp fix this problem or they will lose customers like me and on the other hand I am also returning this laptop."
2,Bring a portable fan with you,I'm going to return mine ... this unit locks up regularly due to overheating problems...The bios upgrade didn't fix anything... leaving a desktop fan blowing over the unit does.Also the battery life is horrible... under 2 hours for regular use.Nice speakers and seems fast enough when running.
1,REALMENTE MALO,"Estoy absolutamente decepcionado de este notebook. PESIMO servicio tecnico, se calienta mucho, fallaron las bisagras, se quebro la carcaza. No encuentro donde venden estas partes por separado. Debo, segun ""ellos"" c<omprar toda la pantalla a un precio de casi uno nuevo. NO COMPRARE NUNCA COMPAQ NI HP"
3,Compaq presario 700US - TFT screen went bad,I just bought it and it worked pretty well for 5 days. I was very happy until the 6th day when its screen went bad (dead backlight). Compaq told me they will take 10 business days to repair it. I am still contemplating keeping it and getting it repaired or returning it. I really liked it other than this problem.
1,If reliability is important avoid Compaq,"If reliability and customer service are important to you look elsewhere. After years of using Compaq equipment professionally, I've seen a marked decline in the quality and reliability of the Presario series Notebook line. I have a 700Z Custom built that replaced my 1201Z 1 Ghz AMD notebook after Compaq attempted to repair it 5 times in 3 months. The customer service is awful, and they can't seem to get it right. Just this week I ordered a spare battery for the Mdl 700 and they sent the wrong battery. I spent years reccomending Compaq equipment but in good conscience could never reccomend one again. I too have had DVD playback difficulties and thats with it loaded with 384 Meg of RAM."
2,It Disappointed Me,"Only after I used this computer did I realize that this is the worst decision I've done-----1.You have no option for OS except XP, which is the poorest OS I've used. Compaq doesn't provide driver and support for any other OS.2.The manual is very poor and not helpful.3.The refreshing of screen is really bad. It has 1 to 2 seconds delay to refresh the screen when you're paging up or down webpages."
3,pure contemporary relaxation stuff,"I bought this album after hearing the smooth voice of Susanne Vega with ""caramel"" on the movie - it stuck in my brain and I had to get a copy. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that there was more than one track on this album well worth a listen. Now that I've heard the album, there are several tracks I would have bought separately. The bouncy liveliness of Blues Traveller is the kind of song I look forward to listening to on the way to work to put me in a good mood. The Cowboy Junkies' ""Angel Mine"" almost brings me to tears - that song is gorgeous. Of course, Squeeze have brought out another gem (to match the great ""tempted"") and the Al Green song is so cute!! I would recommend this album to anyone who is up for something a little less teeny-pop and a lot more smooth and mature."
4,A Good Mix,"Overall, this CD isn't THAT great. But because there are a few songs on it that are just AWESOME, I had to give it 4 stars. The Cowboy Junkies song ""Angel Mine"" is so beautiful there isn't a word for it. Susanne Vega's song ""Caramel"" is also really good. And there's something about the song ""You Do Something to Me"" by Paul Weller that makes you feel like you're deeply in love, even if you're not. And the rest of the songs aren't BAD, but they're not really worth mentioning. But I think the CD is worth getting just for the Cowboy Junkies song."
4,hard to find song..,I bought this album for 1 very hard to find song. Shipping was more than the CD price.
1,Ridiculous,"This thing is impossible to mount, and my Ksyrium wheels seem to be super easy with any other tire so I can't imagine how it would fare on wheels which are normally more difficult to mount standard tires onto. I cannot get the last portion of the tire over the rim without using a tire lever to pry it over, and so have punctured three tubes, a total waste. As well as a total waste on the tire.DO NOT BUY!!"
2,Way Too Difficult to Mount,"I bought my Continental Ultra Sport Hometrainer tire (700x23) a year and a half ago from a local bike shop. I had read reviews that said it was hard to mount, but they failed to tell the whole story. This tire is nearly impossible to get on the rim and once there, it won't seat properly. Changing tubes would take well over an hour - mount, inflate, not seated properly, delfate, remount, inflate, not seated, etc, etc, etc. Once you got it, the ride was fine and the tire was quiet. I recently replaced it with a Tacx Trainer Tyre which mounts much easier than this one. I bearly got a years worth of riding out of the Continental before it wore out."
3,Durability problems.,"Difficult to mount. Smooth rolling, quiet and clean. Yellow model lasted seventy hours. Replacement black model lasted less than twenty before a segment ballooned and failed."
1,Poor Quality,"I had a yellow Continental trainer tire for well over 4k miles before it finally gave out. Seeing as Conti doesn't make that tire anymore, I opted for this new black trainer tire. I don't know how Conti managed to do it, but they made an inferior product. I've now gone through two of these tires in the last 2.5 months, each with a little over 1k miles on them before blowout."
4,Excellently researched studies,"A good foundation of Colombian history would help the reader, for what is told within is extremeley insightful, and necessary for gaining a profound understanding of Colombia's unfortunate situation. The compilation of authors in this anthology brings together the economic, political, historical and sociological factors that have, and continue to, contribute to Colombia's demise. They show how it finds itself in regards to the rest of the world, as well as within its own borders."
4,An Honest Examination of a Violent Culture,"This book offers a collection of viewpoints. Each gives detailed explanations of the violence in Colombia. Moreover, it goes into great lenths to explain the dynamics of the civil war in Colombia. The scholars that contribute to this book are outstanding. However, I found Gonzalo Sánchez to be the most engaging."
3,"Handy little book, charmingly anachronistic","Much of the advice in this 50s edition seems out-of-date today (as when a role model beats up another boy for abusing a dog), but the anachronistic earnestness makes this little book fun to browse through. Written for scoutmasters and their assistants, most of the book is a catalogue of games meant to instruct the scout on some point of conduct related to scouting. As a non-scout, I was still pleasantly surprised to see that many of the activities can be fully enjoyed by anyone who is interested in upright citizenship or the outdoors. This could be a handy pocket guide for someone looking to learn basic woods lore, or knot-tying, for example. The writing itself is pretty tortuous, with lots of clunky prose and even confusing sentences. But that shouldn't prevent an interested reader from skimming through and finding some fun activities to do with children or even adult friends on a camping trip."
1,Horrible Camera,"this is a horrible product. feels very cheaply made, takes horrible photos, and interface is strange and confusing."
1,"Not for City Lots, that's for Sure","I looked at this book in hopes of finding ideas for remodeling or adding a story to an existing 1 story house. The house is on a 50 x 150 lot, pretty typical for a midwestern suburb. I would say that I saw about 2 plans (out of over 200) that could conceivably be placed on such a lot. Almost all of the designs wouldn't fit on a 50 foot wide lot. And those that would typically had the garage facing the long side of the lot with a full 35-40 foot wide house facing the short side of the lot. This would only work on a corner lot, unless you have a back alley, which seems pretty rare these days. So if you're dealing with a typical city/suburb lot, this isn't a good book at all. I'd be interested to know exactly what the editors believe a ""narrow"" lot is."
2,Ordered 2 and wouldn't get more,"I ordered the green ones an got red ones. Not a game changer, but why specify a color? One broke within 3 weeks of arrival. The epoxy holding the halves together broke apart and both of them had damage in the compartments with the treats. So, interesting concept, but suboptimal execution."
5,Edgar Kennedy Brought to Light,"Bill Cassara's book sheds new light on the fascinating life and times of Edgar L. Kennedy. Credited with over 500 films, Edgar had a colorful life in and around California during Hollywood's heyday. Edgar worked with all the movie greats who often looked to him for suggestions and guidance in the art of Comedy and film making. Mr. Cassara has done some painstaking research and has brought to life many parts of Edgar Kennedy's previously unknown career. This book is laviously illustrated (many photos heretofor unpublished)and revels both Edgar's professional and family side. It's an easy yet scholarly read that does much to fill in an area of Hollywood's past, few film bffs are aware of. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in actors (Particulally Edgar), who worked in Silents and Sound, and with most of Hollywood's greatest stars. Edgar Kennedy, Master of the Slow Burn should be on any film buff's reference bookshelf."
4,Shimmering solos,"Dolphy was powerful as a sax and clarinet player but singular as a flutist. Even if there are only few of the latter, his seductive style is in full effect here as usual."
3,No spit-ups!,"I fed my cats this food (and sometimes the organic version) for two years. They loved it and were healthy and happy. Then PetSmart stopped selling it and I looked for alternatives. One they hated and wouldn't eat, one was ok, but I settled on Science Diet because of it's good reputation. Almost immediately, I started finding spit-ups of largely undigested food everywhere. Realized that we had the same problem with our prior cats on Science Diet. It may be more costly, especially with shipping, but I am going back. The savings in time and clean-up efforts are worth it, my kitties love it, and it smells so good I almost want to eat it!Update: they seemed to be using a new manufacturing process and/or recipe last time I purchased (mid-2012). Shape was different, didn't smell as good, and my cats stopped eating it. Reduced to 3 stars for that - maybe your cats will like it better."
1,"Seconding ""Utter tosh""","This book primarily concerns an American student's efforts to meet girls in his year abroad at Cambridge, interspersed with dry excerpts from his thesis and smug observations of upper class college students behaving badly. When he gets dumped by a Canadian, he blames it on her pretentious British attitude. Not much introspection, here.If anything, this book convinced me that Cambridge students are no different from their American counterparts. All college students want to do is get drunk and get laid."
2,Openings Too Small,"This was a very well made acrylic piece and the perfect size for small vanity drawers. Unfortunately, the openings for the lipsticks were too small for several of my lipsticks. Mac tubes and a couple of other ordinary brands would not fit into the square openings. Not wanting to keep my lipsticks in two different places, I returned the item. If the diameter of your lipsticks is on the narrow/small side, this would work very nicely. Otherwise, no."
5,Excellent,"This book is unique. It is the most comprehensive treatment of the basic theory of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids that I know of.It contains a lot of interesting material that is not treated in elementary texts and is dispersed in the research literature, and the authors present it in a rigorous but engaging manner. What I value most of the book are the insightful comments and discussions throughout; it gives one a proper perspective and a deepened understanding of the subject. The book is not suitable for a first course in fluid mechanics, but it should be an excellent text for beginning graduate students -- both engineering students who want to learn the mathematics and mathematics students who want to understand the physics."
2,Disappointing,"Because I am a big fan of previous works from one of the authors, it came as surprise to me how disappointing this new book is. The book contains a lot of material and discussions that are irrelevant to the science of Fluid Mechanics. In many occasions, the clarity of the theoretical expositions is overshadow by lateral discussions that cannot be justified on a book of such basic level. The reader is left wondering if there was agreement and understanding among the authors on the content selected for the book. I read the book and got the feeling that the book contains parts that are original and interesting. The problem is that they never coincide: when they are interesting they are not original - when they are original they are not interesting. As a whole the book did not add to my collection."
4,One of Robinson's more entertaining books,"This was a fun, entertaining, and educational, read. Robinson combines fact, humor, and realistic characters going through their normal lives, yet still manages to give us a story about matters of global scope. I enjoyed this more than some or Robinson's other books. I also enjoyed the Mars Trilogy and Years of Rice and Salt, but this was a more fun read; it has fewer threads and is thus easier to follow. But it gets you thinking more than, say your typical mystery/thriller. If you like science fiction based on fact, and thrillers, you should give this book a try."
2,Forty Beats on the Same Drum,"Robinson has written some pretty good stuff -- the Mars trilogy and Years of Rice and Salt (one of my faves). This book is simply too preachy, too slow moving, and too boring. Even the scenes that were inserted to increase tension are surprisingly slack. Usually when I finish a book in a short series, I quickly go seek out the next volume. Here I have no interest in finding out what happens. It is all so obvious! Why bother reading on about it if the characters are so dull??I had to force myself to finish this book. Ouch.Read KSR's other books and leave this one alone."
1,Forty Signs of Rain,"I feel like I really ought to finish this book before I say anything.... but gee, do I HAVE to? It's like pulling teeth.Let's be brutally honest, Stanley's strength is the story, plot, and his imagination. Literary pinache just ain't there - never was. Not in the same league as SF writers like Gibson, or Simmons. But his stories CAN be a lot fun. I mean, the Mars Trilogy was a real triumph! But if the story sort of stinks, (and I don't have a problem with his political-scientific perspective) then the bland writing becomes very conspicuous.So, I wasted my money, but worse, my expectations were dashed. And some time was wasted."
3,????,What? Why in the world would the book just end like that?!? There is no cliff hanger. No ultimate reason to read the next book other than to find out what else happens.I would have to say that the story was okay. The characters are likable and pretty real. But the end was lame. I've liked some of the other books by this author and while I knew it was a 3 part story I didn't think it would be that bad of a transition.Please remember that this is a work of fiction...just like Algore's books and movie.
3,Kim Stanley Robinson: Not one of his best,"I REALLY enjoyed KSR's Mars Trilogy, as well as Antartica, so I looked forward to reading 40 Signs of Rain. However, while interesting enough to keep me reading, had much less action than his previous novels. When I say action, what I mean is that he did spend a lot of time on characters, but not much actually happened, until the very last chapters of the book.Overall, I was disappointed with 40 Signs of Rain, but not disappointed enough NOT to want to read the next book in this trilogy.KSR is a fabulous writer, but this just wasn't up to his previous level of writing."
1,Pointless,"Bought FIFTY DEGREES BELOW first then FORTY SIGNS OF RAIN after realizing Forty was first. FORTY is almost 400 pages long and it takes 180 of mindless, useless, pointless drivel before starting to tell the story. I read and read thinking ""This is pointless"", then ""what is this book about?"". I reread the brief book discription on the back cover again. Sure enough..pointless drivel! About 240 pages in, my mind is yelling ""THERE IS NO POINT, STOP READING"". I thought that it had to get better. It did not. Perhaps the last 60 pages got to the point...sort of. All in all FORTY is mindless and pointless. I don't know if I can read FIFTY now but then again..could it be worse?"
3,"Not bad, but definitely in need of editing","Although this book was not fantastic, it still was enjoyable in many ways. I found both the Quiblers to be interesting characters (when they weren't speaking with the Khembalis), and their parts flowed quickly.Perhaps the biggest problem is Frank. He's just not an appealing character, and not in a good way. His tendency is to think everything in long, drawn out passages about how everything can be seen in the context of primates and biological anthropology, which might be interesting in a textbook but makes for poor reading in a novel, and very slow characterization.Overall, though, this book really needs a better editor. It just didn't flow very well, and the sequence of events that occurred didn't seem to connect well into an overarching plot of sorts. That can be a good thing if a book is very character-driven, but this book is not that."
2,Tedious,"Kim Stanley Robinson may write good books(I wouldn't know, as this is my first go at reading his work), but this is not one of them. The premise is interesting, certainly, but the plot is non-existent. The high point of the novel is a severe rain storm that floods the DC area and it occurs in the last few chapters of the book.I choked down pages and pages of rambling on about how the scientific community chooses which ideas to fund and promote, more pages about how the evolutionary theory informs human behavior and yet more pages about Buddhism in the hopes of finding a point. Something! Sadly, it was not to be found. The most interesting character in the book is a two year old, who-in one of KSR's more startling tangents-may be a reincarnated lama. No, really. I have no idea what that particular idea is doing in this book. Skip this, unless you live for committee meetings and the political sides of science."
2,Mediocre at best.,I found the slow pace hard to get through. It seemed like it took forever to get anywhere and when it did there just wasn't much for me to get excited about. I felt mislead in that the book is shelved in the Sci-Fi section of bookstore but this is far from being sci-fi. I was looking for a good apocalyptic story but instead got a lot of political ramblings which were a little misguided.
2,Not enough to deserve a reading,"I expected more from KSR in this book. His Mars trilogy book were slow but had a clear theme. In this case, I do not recommend this book.Main reasons for my dissatisfaction are: slow construction of the story, weak characters, dialog not always realistic, non-exciting finale. Many times it seems the book was written to become a blockbuster movie, and I am not sure it would even make a good one.Overall, the story is in the near future, the world is warmer, sea level is rising and scientists are concerned. It really takes a long while in this book to reach a climax, which is not even that. I may read the 2nd part of this series (whenever I have time) and if I see a reason to read this, I will update my review. In the meantime, I suggest you read a Stephen Baxter book instead (if you want good sci-fi)."
1,I tried really hard to like this book,"I love end-of-the-world stories, especially those with a solid scientific foundation. Unfortunately, FDOR is missing a key element of the end-of-the-world series, namely the end of the world. The story is dull, slice-of-everyday-life, too preoccupied with traffic jams and baby minding to really engage the audience.It's also grossly misogynistic. Nearly every female character in the story is introduced through the eyes of a male character admiring her curves. The lead scientist is praised repeatedly by one of the main (male) characters as doing science like a man, as opposed to like a woman, and she's constantly shown throughout the narrative with a pump attached to her breast. Robinson, I appreciate that you included female characters, especially female scientists, as strong female characters are still very much lacking in hard SF. But your treatment of these characters completely undermines the benefit gained by their inclusion."
2,Too Much Politics,"Robinson is a good enough writer to keep my attention, but he gets way too heavy handed with his politics."
2,"Light on Story, Heavy on Politics","I went from Rice & Salt directly to FSoR. I'd agree with most of what the other lukewarm reviews say.The only thing I would add is that i don't read science fiction to be beaten over the head with a political agenda. The not-so-subtle jabs at what would seem to be conservative beliefs were not offensive to me, but did detract significantly from the story.It is one thing to have some characters believe in a particular political position, it is quite another when every character does. That's not interesting, it's just dull."
2,Alas,"Alas, Robinson is an excellent writer, except on those occasions when he lets his sense of self-righteousness run away with him.He can't seem to imagine that anyone could disagree with him unless they were wicked or stupid, and the sock-puppets he's substituted for characters here show the same disagreeable trait.This got old in the ""Red Mars"" series, but you could put up with it for the good bits.Here, Stan the Soapbox Man has overwhelmed Kim Stanley Robinson the writer; the good bits become vanishingly scarce.Don't bother. Get one of his older books."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"An interesting book, and one that politics geeks may well enjoy. Robinson has decided to have a look at climate change, via a couple ofpolitical insiders, including an evironmental advisor, and a scientist.An embassy from a small island nation literally about to disappear comes to Washington D.C. and the aforementioned characters becomeinvolved with them.Oh, and Washington gets really, really wet."
3,Wait for the trilogy to be complete,"Sorry this is short, but the other reviewers have done a good job already. I am a KSR fan, but was disappointed in this book. Problem was that it wasn't a whole story. It's only a third of a story. A good trilogy requires a conclusion in each book and an anticipation of the next. This first book had good writing and story telling, but didn't have an ending. I say wait until all three books are published -- hopefully in one volume!"
2,"Too many pages, not enough happens","Reading along in Forty Signs of Rain, I kept having flashbacks to the Niven & Pournelle classic Lucifer's Hammer. It wasn't until I got to the end of Forty Signs that I realized how apt that comparison really was.This was a disappointing book. So many pages for so little to happen, especially when compared to Robinson's Red Mars, where he got us to Mars early on in the first book of the trilogy. We get pretty much nowhere in this book.Niven & Pournelle did all they needed to do in one nice, fat book. I'm not interested enough in where Robinson is going to see if he does a comparable job in three books. Definitely not his best moment."
3,Spooky foresight: problematic tropical storm is named Sandy,"This isn't actually a review, but mainly a comment about my spooky experience listening to this book on CD in early 2013. The book was written in 2004, set mainly in Washington DC in the Bush years....but a storm floods DC near the very end of the book, and the storm is named Tropical Storm Sandy. The hair on my neck stood on end when I heard that name. The extent of the flood is due to a storm surge occurring during high tide. The book, about the failure of the scientific establishment to do anything about climate change, is only a so-so book. But the signs of climate change presented in the novel, that actually weren't occurring in 2004 when the book was published, include many that are occurring now, 8 years later. And he named the storm Sandy. Very, very spooky.JDLG"
2,not my kind of read,"Not my kind of genre to read. I had to buy it because I am in a book club. Unless you are in to sci-fi, I don't recommend this book."
3,incomplete,"Well, the huge problem with this book is obvious -- it is not a complete novel. Lots of characters are introduced, and most of them become quite interesting. Several plot threads are started up, too. And then it just ends.Frankly, I don't think it should have been published in this form. It is about as satisfying as buying only the A-G sections of an encyclopedia.I didn't mind all the NSF scenes, or the child-rearing scenes, or the biotech lab scenes. It's just that they don't add up to anything. Yet."
2,Interesting concept,"I'm a little disappointed with this book as it is a little technical for pleasure reading. There is a lot that doesn't seem to have much to do with what I perceived as the theme of the book ie global warming. I have about 30 pages left to read, and did buy the second of the series, so am hoping for something a little easier read."
2,Polemical novels don't have to be this tepidly contrived.,"This is a poor excuse for a novel but there's enough that appeals that I read it through to the inconclusive end (which was irritating). Stay-at-home dad and environmental lobbyist in D.C. and his cohorts expose the contradictory functioning of the National Science Foundation and the worse functioning, or lack thereof, of the U.S. political machine on Global Warming. Highly polemical but that's not its problem; writer didn't have a plot or story in mind so much as an expose. Best bits in the book are the visiting buddhists (who just might be poaching a new Pachen Lama) and the dad's relationship with his almost two-year old son. Polemical novels don't have to be this weak. You can have a point without ... being ineffective."
4,Great photos and gallery.,"150 pages, Full color photos throughout the book, good gallery in each chapter. Most items are single piece (except necklaces). Well written with clear instructions but I haven't made anything from this book (just not my style). Projects: Earrings, Brooches, Bangles, Rings, (Bead) Necklaces. Finishing: Dying, Inlaying Wire, Laminating."
2,lame,"I had to get this book for class, it was poorly written. I do not recomend buying this book, unless you have to."
4,A good starting over view of comparative aethetics,"I found this book enjoyable to read but limited in its scope. As an introduction to comparative aesthetics, it's good, but not great. For example, the section on India pretty much leaves out Buddhism...a highly influential religion within the region. But I suppose no book is perfect."
4,Not quite what I expected,"I've been trying to find a replacement coffee for the Trader Joe's Coffee a' Cocoa. This is pretty good but not quite what I wanted. My coffee maker only makes 6 cups, so I had to dump the packets into a container and measure the amount I needed."
3,A little too much...,"Although this book is a good basic overview of travel in Italy, it is written in an unnecessarily pedantic style. I found other travel guides on Italy to be much more reader-friendly and useful."
2,not so great,"I thought this was a good product until I read on the package;""This product contains a chemical which is consid. in the state of CA to cause birth defects..."", very disappointing; I try to feed my dogs more healthy stuff, and this product contains chemicals???I wrote the company five days ago and have gotten no response on this issue! I rather feed my dogs Bio strath, at least that is 100% natural and great for them."
5,Love these sandals,"This is a great looking sandal. Like all Onex sandals they are very comfortable. The front part of the sandal is a little narrow, but OK for a medium width. If you have a wide foot this is not the sandal for you. I have several pair of Onex sandals/shoes. You can't go wrong with this brand."
4,NOT IVORY BEIGE,"This is a beautiful set, but it is NOT ivory beige. It is actually a soft sage green and clashes with brown or beige walls. The picture is deceptive because of the sheen of the fabric. The company was very understanding and took measures to make me happy."
4,Daybed comforter,The colors are very true to the picture. The fabric is not as durable as I would like. The sizing is very nice with large size pillow shams.
5,seen at BIFF,"I saw this movie at the Bermuda Film Festival in 2007. At first, I didn't get it.........but once I did I realised how it was put together, my opinion is that it is a very artistically alluring movie. Each segment was made by accomplished producers who showed what love looked like from their perspective; a delightful film!"
2,"If this is Paris, I don't want to go there","These short little vignettes don't ever add up to anything. After 3 or 4 the cliches start piling on and it's boring. They might as well have filmed this in Kansas City as far as learning about or even simply seeing Paris. Apparently there is absolutely nothing to see or do in Paris It's just like any other nondescript city in the western world, and it's extremely violent and unfriendly. If this is truly Paris I don't want to go there. I love French movies as I am French myself but this one is simply phony. Out of the 20 French movies I have on my shelf this one goes right to the bottom of my list."
5,Great movie...,Hi... this is a very unique and special work... You can see many points of view to Paris and his love power... The only problem that I see is understand some sub-histories... but it's so great... =)
3,Left with a feeling of bewilderment,"While Paris, Je T'aime includes an all-star cast of famous actresses and actors along with many great directors, the films didn't necessarily relay the message within the title. Yes, they were set in Paris, however all the short films were very loose in structure.It is inevitable that some of the short films were going to be better than the others, so I would not rush out to buy this, but it will not be a waste of time if you're curious to watch it."
4,Charming and wonderful. You're sure to find a story you love!,"Charming and delightful. 20 shorts, each five minutes long. Like all anthology movies, some tales work better than others, but you are sure to find some favorites. (I liked the mime, vampire, Bob Hoskins', Natalie Portman's, and American tourist stories the most!) I think it would appeal to American audiences more if the stories were presented in a different order (as recognizable Hollywood actors aren't presented until half-an-hour into it). But it's a wonderful film of 20 delicious nibbles devoted to the city of love."
5,Paris Je t'Aime,love storys by the pound never a clear ending for any but its more to instill loves many forms and situations
1,Paris je t'aime mais je déteste ce film !,"I was expecting a film titled ""Paris I love you"" to be more about... well, you guessed, THE CITY OF LIGHTS!I wasn't expecting a series of inane stories about some random people with some mediocre Paris scenes in the background. Not to mention how trite and nauseating the politically correct clichés are.I've been to Paris four times and I was expecting this movie to bring back some beautiful memories. Au contraire! It reminded me about the very few things I don't like about Paris.Honestly, even ""Ratatouille"" did a better job."
2,"Artistic but pointless, absurd, and disconnected","This movie has a non-linear storyline like Pulp Fiction, Amorres Perros, and Babel; but unlike Pulp Fiction, Amorres Perros, and Babel the stories in ""Paris, Je T'Amime"" no connections at all, which makes the film pointless and meaningless, and Pulp Fiction, Amorres Perros, and Babel the stories in those films have a lot connections between the stories, which give the films a purpose. But this film is total crap if you compare to Pulp Fiction, Amorres Perros, and Babel."
3,nice movie if you want to reminesce about Paris - story lines dont tie in together,Wish the stories tied in some - some worked some a little obscure or tried too hard to be creative
3,"NOT GOOD, BUT NOT BAD EITHER. INTERESTING.","18 five minutes VIGNETTES that have some element of love comprise this movie. Some are better than others, but I found none of them to be especially compelling. I watched it all the way through. I was never bored, but that's not much of a selling point. Some stories are in English, while most are in French (subtitles are necessary, unless you speak French).Plain and simple, I regret purchasing this movie and do not recommend it."
2,subtitles ruin the movie,"There are some great shorts here, and some good ones, and no bad ones. But much of the movie is in French, and if you don't know French you'll need subtitles. But the subtitles are only for the hearing impaired (so even the English has subtitles, and there are written notes about what is happening in the sounds in addition to dialog. It's pretty awful. And there is no way to turn them off. I tried on two different players, and it's all or nothing. It's a shame, and it's stupid, too. The solution? Learn French!"
2,Boring,"A artistic film, but seriously boring. At times, it went so slow or switched gears so much (awkwardly) that it seemed that the only point was to be artistic, not to stick to a them or type of story at all. I can't recommend to anyone."
4,Gay Bedroom Scene Excised,"Consisting of a series of vignettes about life in gay Paris - Paris Je T'Aime can be whimsical, comedic, art house, romantic, mock horror and tragic. Like having a box of assorted candy.I am quite sure that this version of the DVD's been edited. The version I saw at the cinema shown the two gay men in Gus Van Sant's segment hooking up towards the end of the movie. It was an intimate bedroom scene, very tender.Other than that, Paris Je T'Aime is one hell of a ride!"
3,Je suis decu !,"A little bit too ""artistique"" for me and, in top of it, one of the short episodes (Quais de Seine (written and directed by Gurinder Chadha) was shown twice in my DVD (and probably another short film was eliminated).""La Ville Lumiere"" is my favorite city. I lived there for 7 years. ""Paris, Je T'aime"" did not bring back any of the beautiful memories."
2,Somebody Forgot to Turn On the Lights,"The city of lights didn't light up for me. Sad to say, as I was all ready to love this film. Not a single episode really stood out for me. I was, of course, happy to see some familiar faces. How nice to see Ben Gazzarra, for example, and Gena Rowlands. I didn't think much was asked of them, however, and didn't get much out of any of the brief clips which failed to impress. Some episodes were better than others, sure, but I was amazed how trite the material was and how limited the imaginations of our top directors are. It just goes to show how much directors need writers. Paris is a great city, of course, but I was even surprised how little was made of the city itself. Small nooks and crannies were used as settings for very narrowly conceived vignettes; they could have been filmed in Cleveland or Liverpool."
1,What a disappointment!,"I expected this to be about Paris, not about people on the verge of; or, in love. I am deaf, so I missed out on any sound effects. As I watched, I kept asking, ""When will this end?"" The cutest couple, to me, was the senior citizen couple. This movie could have taken place anywhere, Paris did not make a difference. Although I did like the fact that the couples were multi-cultured, I did not like the fact that all were heterosexual."
2,Odd but still valuable.,"Las historias que se cuentan valen la pena. Sin duda, Paris siempre sera un lugar idoneo para el amor."
4,"Good stories, all excellent acting",I love most foreign films. This is foreign with some English. I enjoyed it.
4,pretty interesting combination...,"overall, this movie is just amazing... all the different stories bring together the awesomeness that it is... and every scene made me feel connected and interested in what was happening... though a few stories really sunk in deep..."
4,Paris Je T'aime,"Lovely movie, really fun. It helps if you appreciate learning about French culture and life! I did not give it 5 stars because I think it could have been a bit shorter in duration."
2,Hated it,"What can I say? I've recently developed a slight fascination with France, but this film really turned me off. It is a collection of (very) short films supposedly highlighting the quirks of everyday life in Paris. Each story takes place in a different part of town and I suppose they are intended to show the many faces of the renowned city. Personally, I just thought it was weird. Most of the stories seemed completely inane, and just when I thought something was going to happen, they would end abruptly and move on to the next story. The first few installments were slightly interesting, but they seemed to get worse as the film progressed. As for the content, what can I say? Parisians are strange people. I'd like to think I'm more open-minded than many Americans, but I just couldn't relate with most of these people. Maybe the target audience was those who already know and love Paris, but if they were trying to win over new admirers, they certainly didn't succeed with me."
1,For the Bi-Lingual or Deaf Only,"The only english subtitle track is for the deaf, and includes subtitles for the english as well as the french. Oh, and for the sound effects. Really? They didn't want to spring for one extra subtitle track for, oh, I don't know, 90% of the people who buy the film? Highly professional. No, all that extra crap cluttering up the screen isn't distracting at all, thanks. Bottom line, DO NOT BUY."
4,Great human taste,"It is an amazing point of view of what we are, the humans. I think not only in Paris but indeed it is the city which underlines all the people life sensations."
5,The Title Says It All,"When I saw Paris, Je t'Aime earlier this year, I would have rated it four stars. Now it gets five because I find myself revisiting one or more of the eighteen short tales mentally almost every day. With old lovers, new lovers, quarrelsome lovers and never lovers, the short films capture the city, eighteen tales in eighteen different and living arrondisements. Often this is not the Paris of either romance or picture postcards. but that's precisely why it is all the more reason to realize, as the spinster Denver mail carrier does in the fitting, triumphant final short, that just as one loves Paris, the city loves those who live in and visit it. Get your popcorn during the ridiculous Elijah Wood vampire film, but wallow in almost everything else. If in these times of weak dollar, you can't afford an air ticket, Paris, Je t'Aime will stand in very well for the real thing."
4,An Adorable Quilt of a Film,"An adorable quilt of a film -- no patch of the narrative is like another, yet they're all included with the best of intentions. Certainly, the level of execution is as wide ranging as the concept of romance in Paris, but it was refreshing not to have to commit to a story for more than 5 minutes. (7/10)"
4,Overall Pretty Decent,"This is a nicely put together independent film about Paris and the people whose lives are affected by it. I like the idea of all these little shorts. The best was the one Gerard Depardieu directed with Gena Rowlands in it. The second best was the African man who fell in love with Sophie, the African paramedic. There are a couple other little avante garde ones and others that didn't ruffle my feathers at all. The Vampire scene actually grossed me out. After you've seen about ten of them, though, it kind of drags. I see why they edited it the way they did. At least it ends on a fairly uplifting note."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"Whoever designed this product needs to go back to engineering school. The base of this book stand has notches on it which help hold up the back piece. If you use this product for a really light book, then this thing works like a charm. However, if you set a regular hardcover book or a textbook on this thing, the weight of the book causes the base to dip, which causes the notches also sink down and in turn, the back piece collapses, bringing the book down with it. If they show the back picture of this product, you will see the obvious flaw of the design. The genius who designed this book holder just didn't get it. This product collapses on me so many time that I had to return it to the seller."
3,Zelco Hands Free Book Stand,"I'm a medical student so I have lots to read. I previously had one of those plastic bookstands, it was pretty good but I kept leaving it in my car in the sun, so it taosted and started coming apart. I was looking for another and found the zelco, I bought 2, one for a friend. Mine came out a bit stiff but, my friend's didn't. There pretty good and sturdy, the only thing is that the backrest is a bit narrow so my books don't have enough support and open out more than what I would like."
1,Very overpriced!,"This book holder looks like something I would buy at a discount store for $5, not something I paid $29 plus shipping for. I purchased this for my elderly mother who is reading the book ""Truman"" and was unable to hold it up. I was tempeted to throw it out when it arrived but she really needed it, and it does work although its a bit small for the ""Truman"" book.Buyer beware!"
5,A must read for Christians,This book revolutionaized my perspective of Biblical prophecy. The terrible political position of Christian Zionism has created untold havoc in the Middle East. The violence and hatred is only supported by Christian Zionists who fatally misread Biblical text. Chapman does an excellent analysis of the situation and makes a prophetic call for Christians to change.

2,Beware of Figures,"The book in question has inadvertently misled many a readers.The Financial Award quoted in US Dollars is not based on the financial assistance granted to Freshmen alone. The value quoted is the total amount granted for all Freshmen, Sophomore, Junior, and Senior in the SAME Year. I wish this fact were mentioned. On verification with various colleges and universities concerned as to the authenticity of the Financial Assistance amount granted, only few colleges and universities approved the figures whereas the others did not approve the mentioned Financial Assistance amount. This book needs thorough updating. Deadlines and Test requirements mentioned are not updated. Besides, the book needs to mention categorically how much fund was awarded to Freshmen alone previous year.If possible, a country wise figure will be of immense help to all International Students.Otherwise, the book is of a kind of its own and must be with everyone interested in studying in USA.The Chart is very helpful."
5,This book moved me so much I put it on the internet,"I was so moved when I read this book about my homeland that I contacted the current edition publishers (Taiwan Publishing Company in Irvine) and asked permission to create an online edition. So, I bought a scanner and OCR software and the book was online on 11 November 1997. A simple Google search of Formosa Betrayed book will get you to online editions of this book. If more people actually understood the history and true international status of Taiwan, then we would live in a much safer world. Memories of what really happened in crucial moments of Taiwanese history have faded. In particulary, the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951 has all but been forgotten. Taiwan does not belong to the People's Republic of China."
5,True and sad history of Taiwan,"This book tells the truth and what really happened in Taiwan when KMT occupied Taiwan. It helps not only all Taiwanese but also people around the world to realize how Taiwanese have been suffering from KMT's dictatorship. Unfortunately, KMT still exists in this country. I very much hope that this book will be printed again so that it can be available to everyone who wants to understand the true history of Taiwan."
2,"Long, overdrawn, and boring...","Jeffery Renard Allen's first novel ""Rails Under My Back"" is a 500 page + endurance test. It tests how long you can endure one sentance paragraphs(Jeffery, you are not Hemingway), characters that won't shut up after you get sick of them(Lula Mae, Jesus), and a generally confusing narrative. The family tree helped matters, but I still couldn't really give a crap about this dysfunctional family. By the end, I was glad the cops came and forced Jesus to leave, and I never felt so disappointed in a novel. This claims to be great African-American fiction, instead it's an overhyped ""novel"" with overuse of ""urban"" lingo."
1,Kirkpatrick's Book Still Sets the Standard,This is Charles Higham at his worst. Sidney Kirkpatrick's A Cast of Killers is still hands down the best.
1,Higham is a lying Hack,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. ITS A HACK JOB FULL OF LIES AND THATS ALL THIS HIGHAM DOES. LOOK AT ALL THE LIES HE TOLD OF ERROL FLYNN AND WAS PROVEN WRONG BY FRIENDS AND THE FBU FILES HE SAID HE USED AS THE FOUNDATION FOR HIS BOOK.HE JUST REWROTE OTHER AND BETTER BOOKS.THIS MAN IS A MERCHANT OF LIES AND BASELESS ACCUSATIONS.HIS BOOKS ARENT GOOD ENOUGH TO UE AS TOILET PAPER. HIS PUBLISHERS SHOULD BE ASHAMED.
4,Great collection of stories,"I lost the copy I bought as a kid in the '70s, so I was thrilled to find another. The book is a great summary of Bigfoot's ""greatest hits."" Plus there's a unique and hard-to-find ""enhancement"" of the creature in Patterson's film. Looks more like an owl than a primate, but it formed the basis of my image of what Bigfoot looks like early on, so I still dig it.Great book to add to your library IF you're a serious Bigfoot freak like me. If not, you could probably live without it."
3,It's OK,"It fills the bill. Not spectacular but not terrible either. The set I got from OfficeMax a few years ago (for about the same price) seemed a bit better, but they no longer carry it.About what what you would expect given the price."
3,Decent enough product,"Small package, light enough for my tool bag... just the tools I need to perform basic on-sight repairs."
3,EXAMPLES OF POPULAR CHARACTER TYPES,"In short chapters Peck sets out examples of character types that have proven popular during the years in which Peck was most productive. The focus is on types such as vigilantes, mavericks, illiterates who have a wealth of natural knowledge, et. al.The book will not show you how to construct such characters but rather will show you what these characters may look like after they are built."
5,THAT'S MY FATHER!!!,"I first read the book when I was four. I am now, at the age of ninteen, a fully qualified obstrician/gynecologist, all because of this book. I have now, of course, read this several times, but it is still like reading it for the first time. As the title implies, my father is David Olive, the editor of this book. I fully recommend this book to anyone who is remotely interested in a profession as a gynecologist."
4,Good guide.,I am involved in the design of a VME CPU card based on this microcontroller.The basics of the microcontroller and software aspects are well discussed.Surely a must for those working with this microcontroller.
3,For real fans only.,"Of course, only Jon Anderson is an original member of Yes (out of the three). His tracks I already have on ""The More You Know"". The Steve Howe tracks on ""Portraits of Bob Dylan"". The rest are on various Rick Wakeman CDs. This is just a bargain bin item for impulse buyers or Yes completists."
1,dont buy this camera,"I bought this camera to replace my samsung sl40 which was inadvertently thrown in the trash by my 13 yr old. I have had nothing but trouble with the new camera and there is NO SUPPORT from the manufacturer. I have written their support team and have received 0 response. The camera will not accept the brand new memory card I purchased as they recommended. It will not format it and there are no directions to format it on their website. I feel like I just took the seventy dollars I spent on this camera and threw them out the window. I will not give this product even a single good comment. Very unhappy that I have to go out and buy another camera. In the meantime, I have lost precious time since my new grandson will not be this age (two months) ever again. I will never purchase another Cobra product, EVER."
2,Disappointed,"Summed up in one word, disappointed. I never dreamed that the pictures in this book would be in black and white. So much for fish identification when snorkeling, which is why I bought this book. If you want this book for Identification purposes, forget about it. However, if you don't mind seeing page after page of these beautiful fishes in black and white (What is the point?) then this book is for you."
5,Electric,"The band, the setting, the crowd, the mix of set songs, the energy, the percussion......this is just a classic recording."
4,Light reading,"A book you can pick up or put down when life intrudes. A light, interesting good read of this historical period."
3,"Old, but has some good tips.",Materials and techniques for restoring pottery and porcelain have changed over the years but there is some timeless information in this book. Therefore I recommend it.
5,Awesome,"This book really helped me and my fiancee alot! We started reading it before we actually got married and while the lessons are geared toward a married couple, the hints, tips and suggestions are really practical and helpful for those who are engaged! The only drawback that I found in the book was the authors like to put who is speaking next to the work I. (example: I (David)...) I found that kinda pointless, but it's not a drawback to getting the book. The book itself is still really insightful and helpful."
5,love your mate better,"I bought this while my now husband and I were still dating. We met, dated and were married in 8 months. We knew quickly we were meant for eachother, but we wanted to make sure that we were going to start off on a good foundation. Because of this book, we learned to pray together and to seek God's intention of marriage. This book was a great way for us to talk about some of the tough topics in marriage and created more intimacy between us. This book would be wonderful for couples who are dating with intentions of marriage and well as the new or the old married couple. We could all used reminders to love, honor, and respect our spouses."
4,Highly recommended,"This is a tremendously informative book. Densly packed with info, and a fascinating read. My only complaint is that, since chapters were contributed by different writers, there's no style that really permeates the book. The chapter on Techno, for example, does a great job at contextualizing the Detroit sound, pointing out the influences that led to the evolution of techno, from a musical perspective, as well as from a social and even economic perspective. Unfortunately not all chapters are written the same way. The chapter on House, for example, is a bit dizzying for readers unfamiliar with the sounds and beats being described. But nevertheless... READ IT. (And Dance to it, more importantly!)"
2,the history of electronic music without tangerine dream just doesn't exist,"I got this book looking for a ""history of electronic music"". About one tenth of the book covers the early 1900's to the 1970's then its onto disco and beyond (1980-2000). Tangerine Dream has one sentence devoted to it. If you love movies you've probably heard them. (Theif, Firestarter, etc.) Klaus Schulze doesn't even get mentioned. These guys not only defined the field in the 1960's they worked with manufacturers to design the synthesizers that the later groups used and they're still making music now. Should be called ""a history of electronic music with the early chapters missing"" but then I wouldn't have gotten it."
1,Back to the drawing board,"I loved this while it worked. Unfortunately, it was a very brief love affair. The stainless steel body looked wonderful on my granite countertop but the cheap plastic pumping mechanism stopped working after a short time."
1,I got two and they both stopped working after a few weeks,"Maybe my soap is not slippery enough or something...but who cares. You push the thing down, it squirts soap out, and it doesn't spring back up--you have to pull it back up by hand. $35+ down the drain. As it were."
1,Same problem,I also really liked this product but mine also quit working after a couple months. I contacted the manufacturer and they did send me a replacement. I've only had it a couple of weeks so it is working fine so far.
4,Theology of Worship,"Saliers, who has written extensively on the theology of worship, presents a great book to introduce people to the idea of thinking about worship as something filled with meaning and implications. It will serve as a good discussion starter for church groups, and will be a good read for people of all types who are interested in religion. Saliers is an intriguing person and a gifted scholar - this book is truly a gift to the church and will be useful to ministers, laity, and students of theology. It will show them the potential wonder of worship and challenge the assumptions we have all been lulled into holding about our corporate and private worship lives."
4,Scat mat,"I bought the scat mat after recently purchasing a new sectional for my new apartment. My two cats had a tendency of clawing furniture to shreds and I wanted to put an end to it. One of my cats jumped right onto the mat and immediately jumped off! The setting was on low but it was enough to keep her off the couch. My second cat's curiousity eventually caught up to him, and he doesn't even go near the couch now. This product works! I didn't give it five stars though because my cats can hear when the scat mat is turned on, and off. I bought the adapter to go along with the product, and it makes a quiet clicking noise. When the cats hear the clicking noise, they head in the other direction. But if I'm on the couch and the scat mat is off, they circle the couch...no product can outsmart a cat, huh?"
4,Large Scatmat,"I have been using both a medium and large scatmat for about a month now. I have 4 dogs and 2 cats that I wanted to keep out of my living room. The room isn't used that much right now, and a couple of the dogs have been soiling the carpet when I am not around. It only took one day for 3 of the dogs and both cats to realize that it was not a good idea to cross the mat. The Jack Russell took another 3 or 4 days before she decided it was easier to just not go in the room. The only problem I have is that the dogs seem to be able to sense the static, so if I turn them off, they will walk right on over them. I was hoping for something that I could put down periodically to train the dogs not to go in the room. This doesn't seem to do the trick as far as training. But, as long as I keep the mats turned on, in both doorways to the room, they stop at the doorway. No more soiled carpet..."
5,Veterinary Student Approved,"Before getting the mat I was a little scared of what other students at my vet school were going to think. But my wife and I were losing sleep every night because our cats decided that there new favorite thing to do was bang on the knobs of our doors at night. Needless to say, this was keeping us awake. We have had this mat for a little over a week now and the problem has stopped. Also my friends at school are asking if they can use it to train their cats to stay off the counters. So I would give it a 5 and tell anyone who is thinking about it, to go for it. It is amazing how fast it works!"
1,Only worked once or twice,"Put in the battery, turn it onto the highest setting. The red light blinks, but nothing happened in the way of static shocks.I have used non-transparent scatmats several years ago, which worked just fine, so this was disappointing.I left it turned on, using the battery. One morning it was making popping noises and I could feel a shock when I touched it. And my cat apparently felt a shock a bit later, I saw him running out of the room. But later the popping noises stopped, and then it stopped working again.The AC adapter finally arrived, I plug it in, the red light blinks, but there are no static shocks. One of my cats is walking all over it right now without feeling any shocks.By the way, the ""Scat Mat"" label can be peeled off, revealing another label saying ""Pet Safe"".I will try to return this product as defective."
5,The best training device yet!,I have tried so many training devices to keep my cats off my kitchen counters...all seem to work initially but then they become desensitized and are not longer scared. I tried SCCCAT (compressed air) and Jumpos...all a waste of money. The cats only had to come into contact once with the ScatMat and that was it! I think I will be ordering more for a couple other areas I want to keep them from.
2,"didn't stop my dog from going upstairs, even on the highest setting","The uncomfortable feeling of stepping on the mat didn't deter my dog and she just stepped over it and went up the stairs. It only covers a small area, not the width of a staircase. Maybe it would be better for a small dog, my dog is a 72lb. lab."
1,Did not work for our cat,This did not work for our cat he just was able to step on it between the electrode lines or just jump over it.
4,Works great for my German Shepherds,"I am just buying a new one after having bought my original one about 6 years ago...finally gave out after constant use. We tend to get wildlife outside our windows and my German Shepherds would scratch at the windows (also keeps away from Christmas tree). One touch to the mat and no more going near it. Like using with the power adapter, but also have the extension mat and find it's cord is a little to long/troublesome. Be nice if it attached at the other end of the initial mat rather than at the box and was short. Tends to get tangled. DO NOT get the ""substitute"" variety with the paw shaped battery pack (being given currently by Foster & Smith)...does not work as well and can not be used with the power adapter."
5,Scat Mat,Product works well. We are using to keep a small dog from entering a room. He walked on pad one time and now simply avoids the room. This was the result we wanted.
1,Didn't even phase my Chihuahua!,"I put this in place of a pet gate I was using to keep my Chihuahua out of part of the house. I tried it first on Low, she ran right over it, then medium and high. Even at high it was like she didn't even feel it, I definitely felt it and found it to be unpleasant but it did absolutely nothing to keep her from walking right over it again and again."
1,No match for a puggle.,"I have a puggle who, as adorable as he is, continues to be one of the most untrainable, stubborn and clever dogs I've ever encountered. I was told by a friend that this Scat Mat will help me stop him from going into my downstairs family room area. He goes down there every chance he gets to forage for food, or chew something, or go trash picking. He's very smart and listens for when someone leaves the room and doesn't close the door. So I bought the Scat Mat, and the extension, hoping a few good zaps would discourage him. He got zapped once, he barked, then added a little howl of dismay. He sniffed it, then backed up, got a running start and nimbly jumped over the mat and the extension mat. He figured it out in about 30seconds. Epic failure. Scat Mat will be returned.He's a clever little bugger. Maybe it works on other dogs, but not my puggle."
3,ok (but not great) so far,"The mat is certainly effective, in that it works as it's supposed to (we have two of them, blocking two entrances to a room). Two of our three cats have already learned to stay away and are happy elsewhere. The other one, though, simply leaps over the mat. We've only had it in place for a few days, so we may be able to come up with a better solution, but it looks as though we'll have to shell out some more for an extension. That's the only reason for my mediocre star rating. Otherwise, the mat really works."
1,Does not work,"The first time the cat stepped on this mat, she recieved a quick shock. After that, it did nor work."
1,Power adapter that they sell to use with it is not compatible,The power adapter that amazon.com sells to use with the large scat mat is not compatible. You cannot use the power adapter to plug it. It can only be used with batteries.
3,Too soon to tell,My Sammy had back surgery right after I bought the mat so it is too soon to tell if it will work.
1,Cruel to animals,"I used this on myself and it was really painful. While we were setting it up on the couch to keep the dogs off, my cat jumped up to investigate. ZAP!!!!!! She won't go near the couch now after she nearly scratched it to pieces after trying to get off of the mat while being electrocuted. I thought the mat would deliver a slight uncomfortable static charge- but it does much more. It nearly electrocutes them. And there are no ""levels"" - it is just set on HIGH.Also, I thought the mat would assist in training so that I could use it for a week or so and then remove the mat. But pets are not that dumb - they will just avoid the couch when and only when the mat is in place. Personally, I don't want to litter my house with unattractive electrocution mats every day.Only get this if you don't care about harming your animals and making them distrust you forever."
1,Used Sold as New and Defective,"Not only does it not work, but it had 4 splotches of gummy susbstance (like used to adhere things) on it that were dirty and obviously this had been returned before. We tried it out and it has a Low, Medium and High Setting. The most powerful setting was Medium, but even that is nothing. Our Golden Retriever literally stood on it without noticing it at all. 2 paws! So we tried it with bare feet and all it does is vibrate. He actually liked it because of the vibration. And yes, we used a new battery and then tested the battery also to make sure it was good (it was). I just don't expect to receive a used item when it is sold as new. Ugh."
1,Doesn't Last,"I purchased this product 17 months ago from Amazon, it is already broken. The contact that holds the battery is broken. This product is to costly to not even last 2 years. I have no recourse however as it is only under warrenty for 1 year. Before it broke it really does the job but beware..."
2,Not so shocking,"The product is much to weak. I know I know you don't want to burn the feet off of your beloved fluffy, however, some incentive to move off of the mat and stay off the mat would be good. The mat takes to long to activate and when it does my dogs, cats and I can still stand on it without it being to irritating. The worst sensation it provides is its annoying beep, the shock is a joke. Sorry, but I miss the old school ones that let you know that they were there (and not by beeping at you). Are they still available anywhere?"
5,Mat,I want the animals off or away and they are off or away from the area I want them off or away from. Yeah! I met the word count requirement
3,not sure yet,"This is preliminary. It looks as described in product listing. They do provide shocks. I am trying to keep cats out of a certain area that has no doors. The wires are spaced wider that a cats paw. This means that the little dears CAN step on the mats and miss the shock. I'm not sure they have reduced traffic to the ""forbidden zone"". I will update this review when I have been able to prove or disprove the mats' effectiveness."
5,THIS PRODUCT IS YOUR ANSWER!!,"I have a cat that loved to urinate on my favorite lazy-boy chair. I tried many things, including the spray deterrents, and the Tattle-Tale sonic alarm (a piece of junk .. don't waste your money on that thing), before finally deciding to invest in a Scat-Mat, which admittedly is kind of costly. But I'm so glad I spent the money. This finally did the trick. It really does work wonderfully. Sure, you have to wonder how much it hurts the pet to step on it and get shocked, because I've accidentally sat on it a few times and got a heck of a shock, but pets can jump off the thing a lot quicker than a person can. It's definitely not going to hurt them. It's only powered by a 9-volt battery, after all. And like I say, this thing solved the problem. My cat has never gone near the chair again."
3,"Works well enough, but not as advertised...","its a real bummer to order something off of amazon based on a description that has no basis in the reality of the product you receive. I mean, yeah, this product works well enough in disciplining our cats, so we'll keep it... but its so far removed from the description/functionality/features that were described that I almost feel ripped off. Plus, the manual that came with the item doesnt even remotely cover the item I received.Consider this a simultaneous ""WTF? Well, it kinda works, so I guess we'll keep it"" moment.Get your act together, ""PetSafe/ScatMat/Amazon"". This product is TOO EXPENSIVE for what I received, and thats NOT COOL."
5,So glad I found this!,"I was having trouble with my cats jumping up on my kitchen counters shredding paper towels, licking butter, knocking stuff over and generally annoying the crap out of me. I got one of these and that ended pretty much immediately. Yay!One of our cats would just run across it really fast, getting shocked the whole way (stupid cat) so I upped it from low to medium and that put an end to that.Another of our cats, a Maine Coon that I swear has hands rather than paws, and that is an incredibly smart cat started standing up in front of the counter and feeling for it with her ""hands"" to see if it was there. Seriously. I almost died laughing when I saw her do it. So I just moved it further back a bit so she couldn't reach it. She was only fooled the one time, then she didn't want to risk it again.I have to bring it out once a month or so if I see one get up the nerve to try the counter again otherwise I just roll it up and store it in it's box.Best $50 I've ever spent."
3,Cats are smarter then the mat,"The mat works great, if you are trying to keep a cat off of something, but not so well if you are trying to keep them from going outside. Unless the extension is bought, a cat can easily jump over the 30x16 inch mat."
5,Works perfectly,This put a stop to counter surfing from my 10 month old Newfie.I have used scat mats for years with great results. Just named to get another to cover more counter space.
5,only need one time!,this works fabulous! My stubborn Bassett Hound refuses to stay off my couch. Only needed to get a slight zap from this once and he won't go up there if this is on it!!
4,Cats Learn Quickly,This item works great for our problem. We have a few cats that like to visit the kitchen countertops. I bought the large size and it worked great on all the locations I used it even though I had to let part of it hang over in smaller areas. It didn't take long for the cats to learn not to jump up on the countertops anymore... Great Product. I would highly recommend for any problems with pets being where you don't want them to be.
4,Worked great until the dog wised up and jumped over it!,"My Vet tech recommended this item to keep our new puppy out of the laundry room where we kept the cat's litter box. It worked immediately and she wouldn't step on it again, but unfortunately we should have ordered the largest size available and rolled up the excess. The puppy was too smart for us. She saw the cat jump over it and now she takes a running leap to clear the mat and crashes into the laundry room. Now the noise alerts us that she is up to no good. I am still very impressed with the fast results it produced, just wish the dog wasn't so smart."
1,Doesn't stop our dog,"After reading so many glowing reviews on this product, I was excited to try it. We have a small black lab (60 lbs) who LOVES to break into the garbage. We've tried lockable garbage cans and putting the can in a cabinet with child proof locks. She always figures out a way to get to it. So when we heard of the ScatMat, we bought it immediately. It didn't work. Day after day, we left home with the mat set on high and every night, the garbage was strewn everywhere. A few times, we even caught our dog standing on it. We do have cats and it does work on them. One step and they're running in the opposite direction. However, we need it for our dog and in our experience, it doesn't work."
5,Scat Mat,"The older of my two dogs began to relieve herself on the living room carpet. The Scat Mat has solved that problem completely. I thought it might be cruel and unusual punishment, but after one zap, neither dog goes anywhere near it."
1,"PetSafe 60-By-12-Inch ScatMat Electronic Pet Training Mat, Sofa, SKM-C471",We never had the chance to see if it worked. My dogs ate the control box(!). We had wanted to use it by the front door.
1,Bait and Switch Product,"Be careful. The product pictured is not what you are ordering. The photo shows a mat about the size of two seat cushions. What I ended up with was a strip 3"" wide and 48"" long. Not even close to the picture. This is my first disappointment with Amazon shopping. Always been happy before."
1,False Advertising,"I am not actually reviewing the product, but the fact that amazon was creating false advertising with their lightning deal. I just ordered this product while it was a ""lightning deal for 46.99"", but I was still charged the full price of 59.99. I tried to cancel the order within 5 minutes, but it said that it was too late to cancel as it was already processed. I have never had problems with amazon in the past, but I am not very patient with false advertising! Just FYI about future deals."
5,Great training aid,When our last scat mat died we needed to get another due to new and stubborn cat. This one was even better than the last (purchased years ago) because it is battery operated and only comes on when the dog or cat walks on it. Works great.
3,Cats are smarter than scat mat.,The cats respected the scat mat at first but then figured out they could pee next to it so I would have to have wall to wall scat mats in order for it to work.
1,Not worth the money!,The scatmat worked for a couple of months and then just quit working. You can only return it for 30 days. Since mine worked for a couple o f months and then quit I am stuck with a $76.00 piece of plastic. My cats lay on it all the time ... keep in mind this while the mat is on high with new batteries!! Don't waste your money!
5,Great!!!,We were having a problem with our cats jumping on and over a counter to go downstairs where we did not want them. Placed this on the counter part and by the end of the day they no longer tried to get down there. Have also used on kitchen counter with success but if too near refrigerator the vibration causes to go off.One of our cats has thicker fur and we had to turn up to high for him as he jumped on it and layed down at first.We have both been zapped by the mat and it startles more than hurts... feels like a good static shock and leaves your hand/finger tingling a little.I am a Veterinarian and feel this is a great item to help train your pet!!
5,"love the scat mat, but don't care for seller",scat mat really does work . i had doubts about it but it has proven itself. Entirely Pets on the other hand could stand some improvment.
2,May be good one day!,"This item was good at shocking me! It worked very intermittently and I had to remove and reinstall the battery. Ended up returning, my friends have had the same negative experience."
4,"Keeps cats off, but goes off for no reason sometimes","I purchased this to keep cats off the dining room table. When this is on the table, they do stay off. I have noticed, at times, I can hear this clicking/going off, when no one is near it, and nothing around it has moved. When I first had it, it had a strong scent. I suspected the strong scent taught the cats when the item was on the table, versus when it is not. I have found this to be true for 1 of 2 of my cats, when this is not on the table he gets up on it. The other cat learned that he was not to be on the table, and has stopped getting up there."
4,Contech medium pet training mat,One of our cats had begun jumping on the kitchen work surfaces and we had tried all manner of things to prevent him. The Contech medium mat is just the right size to fit onto kitchen counter tops. I witnessed him jump onto the mat and immediately jump off. Since then he does not seem so inclined to jump up and we have often left the mat switched off while in place. The mat is easily relocated to different surfaces so there is no need for multiple units. I highly recommend this for training in situation where all else has failed. The mat would have received five stars but the price was my only complaint.
1,Does not work!,"We were hoping to use this mat to train our two dogs to stay off our new leather couches. It does not shock them or beep at them. Our 55 lb dog just sat there and hung out and the mat just sat there too. Our other dog didn't set it off either. I even put magazines under it thinking that would help create pressure by being on a harder surface. It didn't work. It didn't even work on our hard wood floor with the dog sitting on it. If you push your hand up to it it goes though. So basically, in order to train our dogs through shocking, we also have to get shocked. This product is being returned tomorrow. It doesn't work at all. I would give it a zero if that was an option."
5,Works miracles!!,"This product is a gift from the heavens! I have a cat who consistently woke me up night after night for food. For months I was awoken at 3 or 4 or 5 am to a cat in my face. No matter what I did, she would not stop pestering. I tried water bottles, vinegar, and shutting her out the bedroom door. She would just scratch and the door and carpet as I slowly saw my security deposit flush down the toilet. I even tried feeding her at later times (just before I went to bed) to no avail. (I couldn't leave food out as she is a heavy cat on strict diet).Finally, I discovered the scat mat and voila! I got my first full nights sleep in months. It fits perfectly right outside the bedroom door like a doormat. It only took a couple little shocks and she goes nowhere near the bedroom anymore! When I wake up now (to my alarm, not to her) I open the door to find her curled in a ball a safe distance from the mat.Best $50 I ever spent."
3,Scat Mat sorta works,"I bought the 48 X 20 mat and the extension pad to cover a large entranceway in my home.Positives:1. The dogs only needed to try it once or twice to be aware of what it does.2. It does generally keep them out of the room.3. A humane punitive corrector.Negatives:1. It fires CONSTANTLY for no reason and I can not find out why or how to stop it.2. Must buy ac adapter since the battery will die in a day or two because of item # 13. While it fires constantly when no one is on it, it doesn't always go off when the dogs are on it.4. Sometimes they will take ""the hit"" to get across but not to leave the room.*Point to keep in mind, a coated dog or cat that has hair between its pads is not going to get as strong of a correction if any. Kind of what you would feel on it if you were wearing socks.All in all its good for a couch or an area of the home you dont want animals in, but you will need two times more mat than you think so that the animals cant get around it."
4,Works great,"As soon as my cat step on it, she run away. The product works just fine. Now my cat doesn't even get closer. I touch one of those lines and the mat gave warning sound. The cat scares even from that sound.The only thing about the product is it is not user friendly. There is only one button for all adjustments and turning on and off.It is not easy to understand which mode you are on."
3,Works as advertised... but my cats are too smart.,"This product worked as described. Unfortunately, my cats quickly became unafraid of it. There is a a space between the edge of the mat and the first electric cable inside. My cats learned how bat at the safe section until the mat flipped over on itself... at which point the mat stops working altogether."
4,Works as advertised - prompt delivery,The order was delivered promptly on the agreed terms. The product works as advertised and is a good value from this seller.
5,No more scratching...finally!!,"We bought the Scat Mat in hopes that it would keep our three cats from scratching our furniture. We laid it behind our couch and they no longer scratch that area!! They went on the mat once and never did again. Then we moved the scat mat to another part of the couch and put that clear office chair rug down where the scat mat was before and they won't go on either mat. They look the same and have a similar texture. I am so happy with this purchase!! We bought the 48x20 mat and that was a great size for us.They also sell the ""dummy"" scat mats, but we already had the clear office chair rugs, so we just used them. I'm not sure which is a better deal."
5,The Scat Mats That Saved Our Christmas!,"With two adventurous cats, putting up our Christmas tree and ornaments has been difficult since Fred and Ginger joined our family. They love climbing in and perching in the tree and swatting the ornaments! Three Scat Mats around the tree definitely worked!Now the Mats are strategically placed in other locations to prevent climbing and going into places they shouldn't be (but then,they're cats and they believe they should be able to go anywhere they want!)I enthusiastically endorse Scat Mats.Phil Willcox"
3,"Incredibly flimsy, doesn't stay put","I can't argue that this doesn't work; it does. For $60 I expected a quality product, but this mat is made as cheaply and flimsy as possible. On the lowest setting, my cat sat right on it and stayed there. On high, he jumps off and the mat slides out from under him, so it is not where it needs to be. The vinyl it is made from is too smooth to stay put on my wood floor, and it has a tendency to fold over on itself and drain the battery. If you are thinking that this is constructed like a door mat it is not. It is more like a place mat on your kitchen table.It came with the battery contacts flattened, so that the device did not work. The contacts were made from poor quality thin metal like a dollar store toy. The proper price on this item should be about $15. If that's cool with you, it does work. If not, keep shopping."
5,Keeps my dogs off of my furniture!,I bought the scat mat to protect the new furniture that I had purchased. It has done a fantastic job of keeping my furniture new by deterring my dogs from getting up on it while I am away. I am extremely happy with the scat mat.
1,Not worth it!,"Cats are way smarter than the mat. You need the whole floor covered with scatmats to have any chance at all of keeping them out of a room. They will either jump over one or two wide, or run across three or more. As soon as I bought multiple mats, the power supply was constantly activating itself. Soon after it died. It was replaced at no charge. Unfortunately, the replacement is doing the same thing. I'm boxing the whole mess up and sending it back. I don't even care of I get my money back, I just want someone to know I am darn unhappy with their product."
4,"Good product, but only used it for 10 minutes.","I purchased this mat to keep my cat from running out the front door. She had escaped a few times, and I was trying to find something to keep her in. I put the mat in front of the door, turned it on the lowest setting and waited. She ran down the stairs, and jumped on the mat. It shocked her, and she ran back up the stairs. She tried one more time, before she stopped going all the way down. We turned the mat off, and she hasn't tried to get out since.My only issue is that I bought the mat, only used it for 10 minutes, and now it is sitting on the floor. It was a bit of a waste, but it did work."
3,"Take it away, the cats come back to play.","The cats obviously stay the heck away from this thing after they get shocked for the first time. But they're smart. They return to the area the second you take it away. I used it on my kitchen counters, for example. They didn't get near them when I had the mat on there. But then again, neither would I. So a couple of weeks later, I moved the mat to my sofa. The cats were back on the counter a few hours later. It's not that the Scat Mat is cheap or does not work. It's just that cats are smart enough to know when it's there, and when you've taken it away. I would not recommend this for pet owners hoping to change their cat's behavior."
4,"A little pricey, but does the job very well.","Although a little pricey, this item works perfectly. I received it today, put it in my office doorway and after only 2 attempts, my cat no longer looks at the office door. No more ripped down wires or holes in the leather chair. A good product."
5,ScatMat,This item is great!! We have six cats and have had great results with it. We did however end having to put it on the highest setting for a few stubborn kitties. But after one time on it they haven't tried again.
2,Hoped this worked...,"I was really hoping that this would work. It seemed like a good idea. But even on high intensity, my 10 pound dog was able to push the mat out of the way. I'm not sure how he did this when the intensity was high, but when I got home, the matt was rolled up on one side and moved out of the pathway. He's very determined.I sent the mat back...but this may work for you dog so I would not disregard it without trying it first."
5,No more trash all over the floor!,Our labradoodle had started raiding the trash can ever time we left the house. This product worked wonderful stopping him in his tracks. Great product!
5,Worked for me,I was having a problem with my cat urinating on my couch. I tried many different things available to keep it away from the couch. But none of them worked for long periods of time. I was out of things to try. I ordered the ScatMat and have been using it for about 3 weeks. The cat has not come close to getting back on the couch. So far it has worked great. The dog also does not attempt to get on the couch anymore. I would highly recommend this for areas you do not want your pets.
5,Scat mat works!,"I put my scat mat on the counter in front of my birds cage to deter my cats from their interest in my bird. It worked! One day I noticed the mat was a little crooked and the phone was hanging by the cord. That means the cat scattered in a surprised hurry off of the counter. No cats have been on the counter since. No bird fatalities, no cat injuries....just a little discipline. You may, however, want to gently tape the mat down if it is on a slick surface."
2,Not Worth The Money,"First of all this product is very expensive for what you get. Also, it discharges itself constantly even if it isn't in contact with anything. Just holding the unit by the battery pack up in the air and I can hear it discharging. That means that it will shock the pet, but the pet has to be touching it when it goes off and the recharge cycle is maybe 10 seconds as opposed to it just going off when the pet touches it. I'm very surprised that someone can't come up with a better implementation of this type of product because as a dog owner with a dog that can actually open a completely shut metal trash can it would be very helpful."
1,My 75 pound Golden must have thought it was a joke.,"I bought the 3"" by 46"" to try to keep my Golden from jumping up on the counter to try to get food. I set it to the ""Tone + Stimulation"" setting. The first time she put her paws on it, it didn't tone...and I assume it didn't Stimulate either because she kept her paws up on the counter for a good 10 seconds. I guess her paws did not span the two wires that give the shock, even though the wires are only 1 1/8"" apart. I know the unit was working because I tested it after she got off, and I got a nice surprise. I tempted her a few more times with some scraps of food, and it only zapped her once in about 7 times in contact with the mat. My dog is not dope...she'll take those odds. I sent mine back for a refund."
2,Over priced fot the way it performs,"The cats are not scared of this device, they walk right around it. The mat cannot be laid on a car because the metal hood will make the mat keep going off. When the cat does step on the mat it is too slow to respond. I would reccomend trying any another device besides the scat mat. This devices are way to expensive for no better than they perform."
4,Good product,"This product is great. My dog stays off the lounge when the Scat Mat is on there. Unfortunately he's worked out that he can jump up when the mat isn't there, but he is a freakishly smart dog. It has still solved our problem of him leaving marks on the lounge when we're not there to supervise."
2,Didn't do anything except shock me...,"I bought this to try to keep my 50-lb. mutt off my leather couch. The first day I set it up, one of my cats just happened to jump on it. I saw the red light flash, so I knew it was active and working. My cat just stood there, looking at me with a ""What?"" expression as I stared at him with my mouth open. In other words, it was shocking him but he just stood there. Thinking it was a fluke, I set it up anyway. Many days went by and nothing. I rearranged its position so it would be mostly hidden. My dog isn't exactly an idiot as she knew something was up there so she wasn't taking the bait. I came home one day to find fur and drool marks on the mat, which means like my cat, it did absolutely nothing to deter her from jumping on the couch. I gave up and returned it. It's not a poorly-made product; it just wasn't effective. I don't understand because every time I tested it, it shocked the heck out of me. Oh well, back to blocking off the couch with pillows."
1,"Terrible, terrible, do not buy!","First one I bought didn't work at all, they sent me a new one and I returned the defective one. The new one worked great until I had it for a month, now it is not working either, and of course it is past the return policy. Do not buy! It is a poorly made product!"
2,scatmat,"The scat Mat Electronic Indoor Pet Training Mat did not work. I have contacted the company and was told a new one would be sent to me, but after two weeks I have not received it. I intend to contact the company again."
3,Good Read,"This was a good book to read for anyone in the 20's and for those who are not as well.There are some good questions brought up about career choices, and things you can ask yourself about your current situation. I also find that the book put a little perspective on the work world as well.The format is laid out so you can flip to a certain section even after you've read the book for a quick reference.You can definetly tell it was written by two women, and it shines through in the examples used in the book. Although it appeals to both sexes, women I'm sure will relate more."
1,Sams Teach Yourself Adobe Illustrator 9 in 24 Hours,"This book is waste of your money, It dose not clearly explain things. And the examples are less then helpful. than one star rating was pity vote."
5,The Best Entry Book on Illustrator,"I've taught Illustrator. I make my living using Illustrator. My artwork has appeared in the digital gallery on the Illustrator 8 CD. And for my money and time, Mordy Golding's book is the best. I have used it as a classroom text at The New School, and recommended it to my students at Parsons and at Syracuse University. The clear writing, logical progression through the features of the program, and the down home quality of the narrative (besides being pretty funny at times) sets this apart from most dry-as-a-bone treatments. If you are a high end user of Illustrator, this may not be the book for you, but I found it useful even as a review of features I was neglecting to utilize. Cheers to Mr. Golding."
5,Excellent instruction for the Illustrator 9 beginner.,"If you've had no previous exposure to Illustrator at all, and want to find the quickest and easiest way to start learning the program from scratch, this is your book! The lessons are easy to follow, and give you a good grasp on how Illustrator's many tools and functions work. This is the best book I've found for getting an introduction to using the program. By the time you finish it, you'll have a good enough understanding of the program to begin learning Illustrator's more advanced features. This book is written for the complete Illustrator novice, so if you're looking for a more in depth guide to all of what Illustrator 9 has to offer, this book isn't what you're looking for. But if you want a fast, effective, and fun intro to the program, get yourself this book."
2,Sam's Teach Yourself Adobe Illustrator 9 in 24 Hours,"Sorry to say that I was disapointed in this book, Illustrator 9.0 is an upgrade to 8.0 with new features to bring Illustrators vector art to the web. Sam's Teach Yourself Illustrator 9.0 in 24 Hours falls short in offering any new information from this new version. If you are an Illustrator 8.0 user and want to know about 9.0 then this book is not for you. If you have never used Illustrator before then this is a great book to start with but only to start with. Hopefuly ""Adobe Illustrator 9.0 Classroom in a Book"" will be out soon to answer the question? What does 9.0 have to offer?"
2,Adequate learning for Illustrator,A well organized book that skims over a great deal of issues. The Illustrator 9 coverage is especially weak. The Illustrator Visual QuickStart Guide is better than this book for learning the basics of Illustrator (and that book isn't very good either).
5,What a great prodcut!!!,I am not one to leave reviews. This product is one that deserves mention from me though. The S&R ball retrievers are very easy to use and picks up the golf balls very quickly. This ball retriever works very well around rocks and can clean up a pile of golf balls in no time. I took it with me on vacation and picked up close to a dozen balls in just a couple of minutes. It has all ready paid for its use in just a couple of rounds. Anybody looking to get a new ball retriever should strongly consider the Search and Rescue products.
2,club head covers,"These covers are medium quality.I was really hoping for one to cover my driver, but the # 1 cover is only large enough for my 3 wood.If you have small to regular sized woods, I'm sure this set will be adequate. Don't expect it to cover the oversized drivers."
3,Happy Golfing,"The covers are okay but slip off too easy no matter how you push them on to their limit. In other words,they need to fit tighter."
2,Could be better,"The large headcover did not fit a large TaylorMade Driver, which is why the covers were purchased. The covers are really good looking and made well. We will have to use them on smaller woods."
4,Very funny singer,"Some of Lavin's lines from her songs are now favorites, like ""What was I thinking"", which I use whenever I do something I later regret. Really enjoyed this album. Many songs elicited either little chuckles or big laughs, and were funny, sometimes quirky, and frequently had some interesting little line that related to one's own life.I recommend getting to know this singer. Very original. Very good sense of humor."
5,Enigmatic and timeless,"""Pendulum"" is undeniably Eberhard Weber: No bassist sounds like him. ""Pendulum"" is a richly textured body of work that offers more to the ears than meets the eye: One musician, one instrument creating stark compositional density; ethereal, haunting, enigmatic and timeless."
3,Swings both ways,"3 1/2While practically a nighttime sedative in the best possible sense, Weber's engaging bass melodics are as lullingly agreeable as they are stimulatingly unique, if overall too minimal for its own good."
2,Not much of a maintenance manual,"I ordered this book based upon others' reviews. What you get with this book is a pretty good history of Ford Trucks, but when it comes to maint.issues, it barely skims the surface, then when it does begin to get deep into it, it usually says something to the effect of ""see your Ford maintenance manual"". Well, I thought that's what I was buying, a maintenance manual, but it's not. If you want a history book, go for it. If you want a maintenace manual, buy the Haynes manual. I sent back the ""Bible"" and got the Haynes manual and am very happy!"
4,A nice supplement to your ford owners manual.,The information on how to use 4X4 was wonderul and very helpful. The History of the Ford F series was intresting and how the fords F series compared to other products at that time.
2,Ford F-Series Pickup Owner's Bible: A Hands-On Guide to Gett,Did not iknclude late model info and little or no info on Turbo Diesels and 97 Heavy Duty F250
1,Ford F-Series Pickup Owner's Bible: A Hands-On Guide to Gett,"The book have basic information only, was too general, I need a real repair manual to replece my clutch. Still looking for a decent book."
2,Not What I Expected......,"The item came in about a ""normal"" timeframe however the cd itself was not in a good condition. Certain songs wont even play. Thank God the one song I really wanted to hear plays!"
4,Setting the record straight - this early,"This book was originally written in 1949. That's an important fact to consider when reading it. This makes Mr. Anderson the first historian to publicly state the fact that Hoover authored the New Deal.This is a very trenchant examination of the economics of the period between the start of WWI and the end of WWII, and that includes the Roaring 20s and the Depressed 30s. Since this is a book of economics, it was ignored by historians. Shame, since they're the ones perpetuating the myth that Hoover and FDR were of opposite kinds when the truth is they were merely different by a matter of degree.This book details the true economic situation during that time, but it was the sections on Hoover that really caught my eye, all the massive public works programs and cartelization of the economy that show that the myths are wrong."
3,"Too much common sense, not enough innovation.","I don't really know why this is called a cookbook, it isn't set up like that at all. While it does have some interesting features, I think it's a little outdated and really should be revised to discuss some of the newer technologies available to trainers. This, and because it covers a lot of the very basics, might be why it seems to be filled with too much common sense and not enough truly innovative ideas. I've seen Brandon Hall speak at training shows, and he's obviously a leader in the industry. I just didn't think this book was worth (the money). I'd say only about a quarter of the book is useful. To top it off, the CD-ROM is a waste. I wouldn't recommend this book to trainers or instructional designers with any amount of real-world experience."
3,"I didn't like it, but you might","It wasn't what I thought it would be. I took a class last summer and this was the book we used. If you are a technical type of person, you might understand it, or even a business person. The first half of the book talks about how you need a proposal and how to write one, why web training is ideal for business, etc. The last half is about how to set up a training website.The book uses a lot of case studies, which seems like a good idea, but the book uses too many, and not enough concrete examples."
3,Web-based Training 101,"This book provides a good general description of web-based training, but lacks specific guidance/suggestions. In my opinion,this book is probably more valuable to training executives and managers than to courseware designers/developers."
3,Good but not quite there,The book was great for an introductory and great on ideas. It was in no way a cookbook though.
4,Good introduction to the subject.,This work walks the reader through all aspects of the process of creating web-based training programs. It includes good discussions of project management and authoring tools.
2,It is alright,Not a bad book...but is not one of the best that I have read on the topic. The illustrations and examples could have been better. The same with the organization of the book. Chapter 13 should have followed Chapter 7. The problems of this book can easily be fixed with some patience and hard work.
5,Memories of My Past,"I grew up on the south side of Chicago and remember when I sat in left field thinking how it would be to meet Minnie. My dream came true after reading this book, I felt I knew him all my life. The respect he gave the fans and the respect we gave him is rare in baseball today, this was the thrilling days of ""Go Go"" when we as fans had a real life hero, and that hero is Minnie Minoso in the past and forever in the future we will never forget him. This book is the type of book that takes you back to the past and the memories of great players. It's the type of book you can read time after time after time.Thank You Minnie"
2,Sarge fans beware,"Yes, this is Elizabeth Elmore's latest project, but unless you liked Sarge solely for her lyrics or vocals I would think twice before buying this album. You will not find Sarge's punky indie pop here -- the closest thing is the album's best track, ""Face It,"" and even that song has a modern rock polish far removed from Sarge's rawness. Apparantly Elmore has entered her Lilith Fair phase. Sometimes law school does funny things to people . . .A rotten tomato to Lookout! Records too for releasing something so slick and market-oriented.Rating: 3 out of 10."
3,It looks nice but...,"It looks great. But after using it regularly for over 2 years, it got some stains inside on the dial. It did not stop working. It doesn't look young. I bought it for my dad, he liked it."
3,Yup... dead battery here too...,"...but works fine now the battery's been replaced. All in all, an elegant looking watch, if a little dainty. According to the manual, it has almost no water resistance, but this isn't the kind of watch to wear for a swim anyway. It's a good loking watch to wear for a job interview, though."
1,Watch was a vegetable,"As soon as I saw the deal, I ordered this watch. When i received it, it was absolutely non-functional. It was not running at all. I talked to a customer rep on line as well as from a retail store. It seems the battery had all drained. I did not like this and I returned this product to Amazon and got the credit back."
1,DONT BUY IT,"Even after 2 replacements, the Watch Didnt work. I think i shoudl have listened to earlier comments. DONT..i repeat DONT BUY it online...its a Made in China Watch..sold by the name of Skagen from Denmark."
2,watch stopped working in 5 weeks,It had good looks and was very light. But I was shocked to see my new watch stop working in 5 weeks time. However amazon gave me a refund of the money. It is definitely worth the price if it works well.
3,Battery came dead,It shipped with a dead battery which was lame but after I shelled out for a new one at macys it worked.
1,Received a non-functioning watch,"Received a non-functioning watch. I lost my $10 gift certificate, since when i returned the watch, amazon only returned the actual amount i paid. The only thing i received is disappointment."
3,Not Happy- With Amazon or Skagen,"Like the watch but 6 out of the 8 Skagen watches you sent me had dead batteries. Cost me about 10 bucks per watch to get replaced and since I was giving them as gifts I didn't have time to send them back. I have shopped at Amazon many times and this is my worst experience to date. I'm also very dissappointed with Skagen since I own several of there watches... Don't expect anything will be done about it since I'm just a small buyer,unfortunately for me!"
3,Pretty good but could be better,"I work with spreadsheets all the time so immediately after I got my Palm I started looking for some sort of spreadsheet program. This program works pretty good you can see Excel spreadsheets on your hand held and Word documents and edit them and copy them to your PC and vice versa. Some annoying problems, though. The program doesn't synchronize with files on the computer it mearly copies one over the other. If it detects that the file on the computer and the file on the hand held have both been modified it gives an error. Also, there are too few formulas provided. I have a spreadsheet to calculate subnet masks that will not work with this. Only the most basic formulas are provided. I called Dataviz tech support and there are no formula upgrade packs either. Lastly, the price of this is pretty spendy. I keep kicking myself when I found I could have just bought a new handheld with this software included for what I spent on this software alone!"
2,No statistical logic behind this book,"I bought this book because it was published so recently, and I was disappointed. The only good thing about this book was the section on Internet casinos, and the card counting drills listed in one chapter. This rest of this book is filled with superstitions and assumptions and betting progressions that have no mathematical proof whatsoever, and pretty much that the game cannot be beaten unless you buy his system that he sells. If you are a beginner, this book wont hurt you, but I would reccomend buying a book from a real blackjack author who doesn't have a system that they are trying to sell you throughout the book."
1,Thank you Jerry Patterson for the above bullsh review.,"At one time, years ago, Jerry Patterson was a respected author and purveyer of legitimate information on Blackjack. Unfortunately, he now hawks a worthless BJ scam based on groundless ""theories"" of voodoo Blackjack known as TARGET. Don't waste your time. Get the real stuff from respected authors such as Bryce Carlson, Don Schlesinger, Stanford Wong and Ken Uston."
3,"Much useful info, but heavy sales pitch","This book is useful for anyone who wants to win at blackjack. As an experienced player, I can attest that the info provided herein is comprehensive, complete, accurate and useful -- and if followed correctly will permit you to beat the casino at blackjack.However, I subtracted 2* because the author refused to provide his current system for winning, instead teasing the reader with a not so thinly disguised sales pitch. Anyone who writes a how-to book but leaves out the how-to instructions should be pilloried.In sum, I think both experienced and inexperienced players can benefit from his advice, but will be disappointed that the greedy author has chosen not to share his current strategy."
4,"Gain some, lose some","I love this record and while it's nice to have four remixes of Sleepy Maggie, the hidden track ""Catherine Cries"" that was on the previous edition has been left off this one!The remastering didn't really add much as the record was mastered and mixed well to begin with.Worth getting if you don't have it already, but don't rush to upgrade unless you really like Sleepy Maggie remixes."
5,"""Hi How are You Today"" is excitingly original and unique.","... It's true that traditional Celtic/Anglo songs have been combined with rock before, but MacIsaac brings to his music elements of jazz, with exciting harmonies and progressions. Truly original, creative, artistic, avant garde!!! Plus he's the probably the best fiddler in history, certainly the fastest. Don't miss tracks 8-12, equally as good as 1-6!"
5,RETURN FROM HEAVEN,THIS BOOK CAME IN GREAT CONDITION AND IT SURELY WAS THE BOOK I WAS LOOKING FOR. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ALL WHO HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AFTER-LIFE AND THE RETURN OF OUR LOVED ONES.
5,A message of healing,"Return from Heaven was a wonderfully written book that gives us all hope (and some well documented proof) that love and healing extend beyond the physical body. Bowman's case studies beautifully illustrate how family members return to be born again within the same family and how understanding this can promote healing for not just the child, but for the parents, and other family membersas well. Her insights and documented research give us ""westerners"" a lot to think about, but mostly implore us to listen carefull to the words and actions of our most precious teachers -our children. From the moment I started reading Return From Heaven, I couldn't put it down, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. A great read!"
4,Excellent IF you are NEW TO THIS CONCEPT...,"and what to know more. There is plenty of research, as well as case study examples. If you're new to this concept and want to explore, it's excellent. If you've already accepted the idea as fact, move on to something more advanced."
4,Wanted more,"the book is a very fast read. It contains data from many researchers on the subject, especially how other cultures view reincarnation, which is very informative but it begs for more. The stories described are fun to read."
5,Everyone should read this.,"I've read a few books about reincarnation, but this one has to be one of the best. It's well written and it tells it from all sorts of angles. Even the statistics are there, while it also managed to speak to my heart in a way none of the others did."
2,Not differentiated...,"You will hardly differentiate this album from many others sounding alike. Check Dan Siegel's Inside Out - same tunes, same tempo, same lack of feelings. It is like chewing a piece of gum that has no taste."
3,Oh Well - Liked Bellavia!,"I bought this CD with the love of ""Chase the Clouds Away"" in mind and hoping that I would find other songs I liked as well. I do really like ""Bellavia,"" but I was SO disappointed in the version of ""Chase the Clouds Away."" I listened over and over, trying to figure out what was wrong with this version. FINALLY, I put in my old tape of ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl"" and listened to ""..Clouds.."" on the tape. I THEN discovered what was missing on the CD's version - Grant Gysman (sp?) playing guitar. If you are like me, order ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl"" if you love ""Chase the Clouds Away,"" or you'll also be disappointed in the Greatest Hit's version."
5,It's Chuck!,"Ah, memories...of days gone by, but not forgotten. This is GREAT music, which i have been yearning to own again for quite some time. Glad i finally have it, to listen to again & again & again."
5,MORE THAN WAS EXPECTED!!!,"since runnin` track at ""Y"" back in `70s, i guess did NOT know any, but FEELS SO GOOD..it`s terrific, but there is aWHOLE BUNCH o` GREAT MUSIC ONTHIS CD!!! #s 6 & 9 are `bout as good as #1, or, maybe better.. ALL ARE GOOD & THIS MUSIC JUST FLOWS FROM START TOFINISH.. BUY IT FOR THE KICKS!!!!!"
1,Idiotic,"Why would anyone spend $8.99 plus $5.50 minimum shipping for nuts without knowing the quantity to be supplied? One wonders if it is 6 oz, 9 oz perhaps 15 oz (fast becoming the ""supermarket pound"") or even 16 oz. But the scant information supplied does not tell the interested buyer this crucial fact. I suppose we are expected not to care about such details.PS: They did not offer the option of ""no stars."""
3,past his best,"This recording was made at the very end of Aldred Deller's career, and you can tell. He still tries to create the vocal effects of his youth, but it all seems to take so much more effort. This is particularly noticeable with his trademark floated high notes, no more so than the ""drop, drop"" of music for a while where his previous vocal brilliance has deserted him. I recently heard a repeat of a radio interview with Alfred Deller when he said that every time he heard the opening bars to music for a while it was as though he was about to sing it for the first time. It was clearly a special piece for him, but the earlier recordings (such as the emi release) are far more representative of Deller at his interpretative best, being able to do full justice to that statement"
2,"What a creative, original idea for a book!","NOT. Have you read ""The Hunt for Red October""? Have you seen ""Crimson Tide""? If so, then it won't take you long to see exactly where the story for Robin White's ""Typhoon"" came from. Mix equal parts ""Red October"" and ""Crimson Tide"" and you end up with this book. The book is well-executed, but it's just impossible to get past White's wholesale theft of ideas and concepts from other ""submarine"" books and movies. Very disappointing."
1,Don't bother,"As a career US Navy Submariner, I found it difficult to stomach this book. Although the author has obviously researched submarine operations and gives the impression he has actually set foot on a US Navy sub, he really doesn't appear to understand submarines or the people who operate them. The characters are unrealistic. The author's descriptions of submarine operations are comically unbelievable. Save your money. Or better yet, buy ""Hunt for Red October"". It may be several years old, but it is good."
2,Good writing but unoriginal plot,"I would agree with all those who write that the writing is good but the plot is unoriginal. I'd say, however, that it's a cross between ""Hunt for Red October"" and ""The Caine Mutiny,"" but it just isn't as good as those. If the plot had been less predictable and more original, I would have been able to give the book 5 stars."
3,"Oh please, not another crazy captain!?","One of my favorite sea-story authors, David Poyer, started his career with a series of ""crazy captain"" books. However, Poyer has a deep keel and he was able to sail out of that silly story line. But, never fear, here comes Robin White, giving us another crazy captain. This crazy captain story line is unlikely, insulting, and (after a while) just plain silly.Here is how to read this book.. any time you see the word ""Vann"" (the crazy captain's name) then go into fast forward and jump to the next section.Except for the crazy captain, it's a good story. You could wish for more scenes like the insight into a whaling ship, but they are very few. One can only hope that the crazy captain story thread came from some young punk anti-military development editor who wanted to put in a political statement while pumping up the book's page count.Worth reading, if you skip everything about ""Vann""."
4,Good Jumping Off Point,"As a student I found this book to be helpful and articulate. It has a lot of ground to cover--Ancient Greece to the present day--and does a remarkable job of conveying what happened and why. Though it is occasionally dry, I found myself engaged throughout. My only complaint is that it maybe could have benefited from being a bit longer. Brevity is certainly a virtue, but when your topic is as large as this one, I think a longer book is justified. It's definately nice to have around as a reference book too."
4,A compulsively good page-turner,"For a good summertime read, books don't get much better than this. The plot keeps you guessing how things will turn out and the ending is truly a surprise. Particularly well-drawn are the wartime descriptions, especially the fire-bombing of Dresden."
3,Evolution and Hallucinations of Bigfoot,"Some of the writing in this title is world class, but I have a hard time jumping from the very intresting evolutionary biology of the Siskiyou Wilderness Area to the mystical ""presence"" of a bigfoot-like creature. I would have liked it better if this were two books, instead of just one. Still a wonderful read and a must if you are to explore the area. (Quite a beautiful and rugged hike, I may add.)"
5,Un buen cambio en mi vida.,"Yo e leido muchos libros en mi vida,y ninguno como este es la primera ves que un libro me quita el sueño solo para pensar en lo mucho que me debo querer aunque suene extraño pase la primera noche sin pegar un ojo diciendome a mi misma cuanto me amo lo recomiendo para todos aquellos que tengan deseo de cambiar su vida para una vida mas complaciente y agradable,creo firmemente en un cambio mundial y apolo la idea de esta maravillosa persona que entro a mi vida atraves del libro."
5,Aprender sobre nuestro propio poder,Uno de los mejores libros para darnos cuenta del gran poder y responsabilidad que tenemos sobre nuestra propia vida.
5,Una lectura que no se pueden perder,"Luoisa Hay tiene tanto por decirnos para ayudarnos con nuestro día a día!! Si quieren alimentar su espíritu y su relación con los demás, este es uno de los libros que deben de leer. Gracias Louise!"
4,Lector Satisfecho,Great book! I read it long time ago and usually refer to it when people is stuck with traumatic experiences or self -esteem issues.
5,Great Hits,"The ""Your Hit Parade"" was a really good group of CD's put out by Time-Life a few years ago. 1959 was a good year for music and this CD features the best. This CD is getting more rare and the price is sure to skyrocket."
2,Extended battery means fat,The battery was extended -- I didn't know that meant protruded from the cell phone. I didn't know the battery cover was required because the battery was too fat to fit. Battery was to big and awkward. The battery worked. It arrived on time. That's all.
4,Back in Love Again,"For as long as I can remember, whenever I asked anyone about LTD, they stared at me as if I was crazy. Most people had never even heard of the song ""Stranger"" which I think is one of the greatest songs ever. Now with this Greatest Hits Collection, I can bring my friends into the know with LTD.I actually bought the CD just for the song ""Stranger"", but this CD has become my 70s Soul Groove starter CD. With other songs like Shine On (A Classic), Love Ballad, Holding On and Back in Love Again, I am amazed by the apparent lack of interest or knowledge of this group by people.Many would say that this is a Jeffrey Osbourne Pre-Solo Compilation. I beg to differ. This group's funky sound was only enhanced by Mr. Osbourne stunning vocals.A Definite Music Collection ""Must Have""."
3,"A Great ""Best Of"" CD","This is classic R&B. I grew up listening to these songs. I listened to this a few weeks back and I thought it was 1976..again! ""Where Did We Go Wrong"", ""Love Ballad"", ""Stranger"", ""Back In Love Again"", ""We Party Hearty"", ""Holding On"" is Jeffery Osborne at his best. Don't miss him performing live! I heard ""Love To The World"" this morning on the radio and couldn't help bobbing my head. This is a must for your music collection."
5,Takes you back!!,"If you like old school funk,add this one to your collection!It's got songs on here I didn't even know were from LTD!! Check it out!"
2,Greatest What???,"This proves what I've been saying all along...that the folks in the music business today, don't know good music at all. How can you take a bunch of 'B' side cuts and call it a 'Greatest Hits' album by simply adding the all-time classic ""Love Ballad"". Have you heard of the album ""Togetherness""? Now that right there is a collection of hits! Maybe you should have 'marinated' a bit more with that album before you created this one."
2,Good Anime but Bad Boxset,"Product review:I would not recommend buying this if you already own their normal dvdset or the complete series. This is not worth spending money just for the sake of collection. The Front and Back of the collectible box has advertisement of some other anime. Funimation's DTB box release was way better. Though I gave it a 2 STAR, the Anime itself gets a 5 STAR.Anime Review:Animation/BGM:Pretty decent. Opening/Ending songs are quite catchy.Story (No SPOILERS):The story is centered around a 22 year old male, who is suffering from extreme Social anxiety disorder (SAD). The story explores the human psyche and how it is affected by our daily life. Issues such as social hypocrisy, conspiracy theory, social expectation are also highlighted in this anime."
4,Ah... Now I'm Getting It,"While the characters and story have yet to win me over, the pace at which they are moving forward is hard to ignore. While the comedy rarely made me laugh out loud, I did get enough chuckles from the writing to be interested in exploring more. I'm not enthusiastic about this series but so far it hasn't shown any reason not to move forward with it. This is really coming across as a series that won't be for everyone though and casual anime fans will probably get lost in all the cultural references. Make this one a rental."
1,"it isn't really the film, it is a review commentary of the film","it sucks, but you can't watch the regular movie, at least if you get the directors cut version like i did or whatever-not reccomendable..i wanted to see the movie-not them talking over the movies creation..urgh"
3,Moody but enjoyable movie,"This film is perfect for New Yorkers and fans of Coney Island. Although the movie is filmed during Coney's off-season, so there's little activity there, the scenery will still make you nostalgic. Without knowing the plot of the movie, I bought it strictly for its locale, and wasn't disappointed. And this movie will be further appreciated as Coney Island is soon completely re-vamped. As for the story, its a pathetically sad one but very realistic and the acting leaves nothing to be desired."
3,Independently Mainstream,"This film starts out pretty strong. The characters are interesting and the plot moves along nicely between flashbacks and the present. The shots of Coney Island during the middle of winter are nice as well. Somewhere after the first hour, however, the film turns from a mostly original comedy to a not-at-all original drama. It seems like the studio got involved, turning it from an independent to a mainstream flick. Nevertheless, I do recommend seeing this movie, if only to keep ""Ducky's"" film career going into the next millennium."
1,Almost meritless.,"So there are some brief funny parts near the beginning. Basically the movie started mediocre and rapidly went downhill from there. About two-thirds of the way into the film it hit bottom and apparently started digging. This movie is so horrendously bad that you can't even laugh at it as much as stare in horror. There's almost no plot, just constant droning misery and depression. The movie devoted about a half hour to an extremely boring and drawn-out scene in which the main characters look for their mentally diseased, homeless former friend.The movie gave me a headache and the soundtrack a stomachache. This is the first film I've seen with disease-like symptoms. I write this about 10 minutes after I watch it, and my head is still pounding. For the sake of your mental health, do not watch this movie. It would be best used as a torture device for government interrogators, though perhaps is too potently bad even for that."
5,Good Companion Book,"good companion book for the other book ""Principles of Financial Engineering"" by the same authorClear and easy to understand treatment. The author does not assume a high level of math knowledge of the reader."
4,Good background reading,This good is a very good companion to Hull's book on financial derivatives pricing theory
2,A good first draft not a useful text,"I used this text for a graduate course on financial derivatives in an applied mathematics program. The text generally made a good selection of the topics covered, but often key insights and proofs were missing. There were few useful examples and the end-of-chapter exercises were both too few in number and were not well thought out. The material could have been better organized and less meandering. A more compact and rigorous theoretical presentation surrounded and amplified by lots of good examples--including some involving numerical techniques--would have been both deeper and more accessible to students. As an instructor, I found the text was usable, but required me to add a great deal of my own material for the students. Finally, the index is just about useless, making it difficult to use this work as a reference."
2,"Not a good book to read, even for beginners","This was the first book I read (cover to cover) when I decided to consider quantitative finance. It was suggested to me by a friend.Unfortunately the book offers very little in return for investing your time into reading it. I find it poorly edited; the author repeats certain things over and over again. It's true that he gives an introduction to the BS world, but it's just way too lengthy for an intro.A good intro is Baxter & Rennie's: short, to the point, and informative. After that I find Shrieve's two volumes superb. Shrieve really knows what he is talking about, and I think he uses the right amount of math, and nothing more.Conclusion: don't waste your time with Neftci, there are much better books out-there."
4,Detailed but Comprehensible,This booke really helped me understand topics for a class I was taking. After reading it i almost felt like i understood change of measure and numeraire. one of the few books i'd recommend buying.
2,What is the practical use ?,"Doing a stochastic calculus course during my MSc at ISMA Centre I used this book. However, I found that it lacks a great amount of depths. You can't use it as a substitute for the real literature on stochastic calculus. If you want to play in the premier league don't waste your time discovering all the little mistakes in the book. Just use it when you are completely lost!"
2,I was disappointed,"I bought the book because of all the positive reviews; I did read the negative reviews, but decided to take my chance.This book is useful for reviewing materials that you have learned in the past but forgotten. In my opinion, it's not that good for beginners of mathematical finance (who wants to learn it seriously) because the presentation is so unclear, with lots of hand-waving and skipping essential steps. I am a beginner myself, and I would rather struggle through more mathematically difficult but clearly presented textbooks.I wanted to give this book one star because it was way below expectation, but I gave it two because at least it attempts to offer a layman's explanations (not a very successful attempt, but a positive thing, nonetheless) behind all the math. And it's not like I gained absolutely nothing from it. I guess I would recommend giving this book a shot if you could get it cheaply, perhaps a secondhand copy."
2,A disservice to PDEs,"Yes, this is a friendly, introductory book, and that is no bad thing. The reader is very poorly served, however, by the author's treatment of PDE techniques. Ignorance of a field is no excuse to trash it, and the author betrays an almost complete lack of understanding of even the linear heat equation. This lapse is sadder for being completely unnecessary. Stochastic methods are beautiful and useful in their own right, and do not require a false comparison for motivation.Someone looking for intuition with their mathematical exposition should consider Baxter and Rennie's ""Financial Calculus""."
4,Good Book,"I've read Hull, Wilmott and Baxter books but definitely like this book better - particularly for entry (but not easy) level derivative math. Can't say much since English is not my first language. But if you want to learn about Derivative Math and don't have strong background in Math (I'm a Porfolio Manager and have pretty good background in Calculus, Differential Equation, Econometrics) this book is certainly worth considering. I give 4 stars due to the lack of practice problems."
5,A valiant and successful attempt,"Neftci makes a valiant and serious attempt at explaining stochastic calculus and related mathematics of financial derivatives to the non-expert. I think he succeeds.The exposition may not be as rigourous as many people expect it to be, but that's the whole point of the exercise: to give the reader an introductory and motivated first exposure to risk neutral measures, martingales, stochastic differentiation and integration, Ito's lemma, PDE's, stochastic PDE's, equivalent martingale measures, Girsanov's theorem, and a lot more.This is definitely the very first book that a non-mathematician student of the subject should read. No doubt about that. I guess the burning question now is: Which book makes a natural second read? Baxter and Rennie? Bjork? Bingham and Kiesel? I think it should be one of these three."
4,Good book for the right audience,"It is amazing that people are not willing to take it what it is, an 'introduction' to mathematics of financial derivatives. The 'reader from New York' of 'notation challenged' seemed to have wanted a rigourous treatment of SDE, yet is sorely disappointed not to find it in this book. IMO it gives an extremely clear exposition of the various tools of SDE and having read it has allowed me to progress to books in which mathematical rigor is stressed over intuition. So in a nutshell this book achieved its stated goal of offering an intuitive and heuristic explanation of mathematics of derivatives to the novices taking their first steps in the financial engineering land."
1,Disgusting!,"I am so disgusted by this book that I am unable to write a ""civilized"" review. There is not even a single semi-positive thing about this piece of utter garbage (actually I take it back, the cover looks good!).The ""reader from London"" under ""Look elsewhere""'s review is very accurate. I could't say it any better, first because I am not as eloquent as he is, next because as I said earlier I cannot control my nerves when talking about this piece of junk."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY,"Who ever transfered this movie had no idea what they were doing. The entire movie is cropped horribly. During the opening credits the AT in ATTACK and TS in ROBOTS is cut completely off the screen. Not to mention the actors names, which are totally ineligible.I only bought this because it was the only way for me to see Lemmy Caution movies.I would never buy from this manufacturer again because I would be all the other films are poorly transfered just like this one.Truly a shame !"
2,Not necessary and the title is misleading!!!,"This ""greatest hits"" compilation would have been better if it had been released as the second CD of the first Greatest Hits collection. Why bother to put it out as a separate album, since the songs on this album are clearly inferior to the ones on the first compiliation that was released only a year before? Answer: to make more profits for A&M records, since a 2 CD set would cost about $20 or less, while two separate CDs would cost a total of at least $30! WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!"
4,This is a great compliment CD to GH Part 1,"This CD contains many of the less well-known Styx material that charted modestly years ago. But, for anyone who loves Styx's sound, this CD is a must. Much of their less popular songs are better, in my opinion, than their well-known ones. Their sound is complex and at times unpredictable. Listening to this CD for the first time was kind of like rushing through a really good book; I could't wait to hear if the next song was as good as the last. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are a few tracks I could live without. (Love At First Sight, It Takes Love, Little Suzy, First Time). Take those away and add Love is the Ritual, I'm Okay, and Man in the Wilderness, and it would have 5 stars easily. This is a great way to hear more of Styx than GH Part 1 has to offer, but without having to buy all their CDs to hear their gems."
1,Unnecessary compilation,"I love Styx. But! This release is an excellent example of a band milking its past for all it's worth. It takes a lot of nerve to release a ""greatest hits"" package with so few ""hits"" on it. Anyone who doesn't like Styx (a lot) would not want this CD, and anyone who does like them already has these songs. The two new songs are an obvious attempt to suck loyal fans into buying a whole CD. Shameless. This is the first Styx CD I've ever refused to buy...two new songs or not! Return To paradise was another shameless milking! However, I'm happy to see that Styx is back in the business of releasing real CDs and busting their butts supporting them on the road. They have redeemed themselves, since this terrible mistake. And after seeing the latest tour, I believe their future is bright, even if there are no founding members remaining. The band I saw in 2000 was undeniably Styx! In fact, a new and improved Styx. Who'da thunk it!"
2,Good general map of New Zealand,This map shows New Zealand as a whole with a few little inset maps of the larger towns and cities but it doesn't give any great detail for anything but the main roads.
5,10 Best Series - Kenny Rogers - ALL COMPLETE ORIGINAL VERSIONS,"I make the clarification that they are all original versions as on many compilations of Kenny Rogers there are many new versions are not as good as their originals are you like the general public.Included in the 2005 (First Edition was in 1991 with different cover), 10 Best Series by EMI (in this case Capitol Nashville) and contain ALL COMPLETE ORIGINAL VERSIONS of the 10 most popular songs of Kenny Rogers between 1977 - 1983. Only missing ""Islands In The Stream"" with Dolly Parton (RCA Label)to be all.The sound is excellent, not saturated as the latest greatest hits of most artists in this times (2012).Bargain price, excellent product and better artist.You can see front and back cover in the photo of the product with the name JASP."
5,Brilliant,"This book was hilarious! Roumieu is some sort of genius of insane, wacky, sometimes twisted humor. Please do read this book, you'll be glad you did."
4,It Good Book If You Very Twisted,"After me read this book, me start talking like Bigfoot all the time. Family lose patience and lock me in cellar.This book very silly and have lots of sharp, dry wit. Lots of pictures too, pictures very awesome! Some parts a little over top (is why four stars instead of five,) but that OK, it written by Bigfoot after all.This book NOT for kids or sensitive types. But it great for people with twisted sense of humor. If your friend like Edward Gorey or Bunny Suicides, then give this book. If your friend like Jane Austin, then probably not best choice."
5,Bigfoot like Graham,"Author genius. Bigfoot buy beer for Graham to drink with. Accurate portrayal of Bigfoot life. Please buy book - Bigfoot poor. For more about Bigfoot, visit woods."
2,I must be very odd,I read so many good reviews about this book. I was expecting to fall off my chair. But humor is very subjective and I didn't. I bought this for my daughter but I fear she's going to think I've lost my mind. I'm glad other people nearly peed their pants. I really wanted to but it didn't happen.
1,"Silly, One Long Joke and Not Funny","This got great reviews and I was sure it was going to be funny. I thought the introduction by the Loch Ness Monster was very clever idea, and quite amusing and that this was a sign of good things to come, but no such luck. How is this funny? It's the same ""joke"" on every page, just in a different scenario. I guess I don't get it."
1,Me Write Book: It Bigfoot Memoir,Beware this book is full of profanity!!! Wish someone would have put that on a review before I wasted my money (if someone did put it on a review I missed it).
1,Don't waste your time,"Where do I begin? Let's define the humor - crass, tactless, gross, inane, all come to mind. If you are an adult that enjoys the lowest of lowest humor that includes profanity for profanity's sake, death and dismemberment, that type of garbage, then this book is for you. I think having a humor book on bigfoot is a grand idea, but in my view, humor should transcend across all ages of readers to be humorous, not the gutter type humor this author conveys. Think Calvin and Hobbes, funny to kids, funny to adults, not trying to be offensive to get a lift out of the reader, as this book does. Complete disappointment."
3,Facts but not good function,The book has lots of info but it is not organized well for field use. It makes a great study guide but not very practical for quick use. NREMT-P for 14yrs.
1,Songs I Heard/Harry Connick,"I'm very disappointed in this cd. Connick's trip back to his childhood is coy and annoying. The only tolerable track was ""Over the Rainbow"", and I can't say I was overjoyed by it, either.The arrangements are too ""clever"" and the psuedo-hip material falls flat. (...)"
2,Sounds flat to me,"My wife bought this for our daughter's nursery. Connick takes what could be a great album and provides a lackluster performance. The songs sound the same, with little inflection to keep a child's interest. True Harry Connick Jr. fans probably love this, but if you're looking for something interesting for your children, look elsewhere."
1,Soo disappointing!,"Since I am a mother of a 2 yr. old, I was very excited to see that one of my favorite singers had recorded an album of children's songs. Much to my disappointment I found this CD to be annoying and hard to listen too. Many of the songs are so...all over the place. His interpretations of these songs are awful! Even the more tolerable selections are NOT Harry's normal quality. I NORMALLY LOVE HIS MUSIC, but this CD is best left on the shelf. I feel ripped off that I bought it."
2,Songs I Heard Harry Connick Jr.,"Songs I Heard Harry Connick Jr, is good cd. I also purchase Whitney Houston's Christmas album ""One Wish"". There are no words to describe how this lady can pull it off. I mean if you have her Christmas album you know what I'm talking about. Her version of ""Joy To The World"" is the best version I've ever heard. ""O Holy Night"" she gave me chills. Whitney Houston's Christmas album ""One Wish"" is great! If you havent check it out you should. I'm so happy I did ""One Wish"", and ""Songs I Heard"" is the way to go for the Christmas season spirit!"
2,Good for Parents; So-so for Kids,"Much of what is good about Harry Connick Jr.'s music--his unusual phrasing, his unique song stylings--works against this disk from a child's point of view as he alters some well-chosen material almost beyond recognition.My family (which includes five children, 4-14) listens to all kinds of children's music, and the kids would rate this near the bottom (though most have grown to like his version of ""Oompa Loompa"").My wife and I, who own several of Connick's other CD's, enjoy this disk. But it would get a lot more airplay in the minivan if it were sung with kids in mind.If he set out to create an album of children's songs for adult ears, Connick has succeeded. If you're looking for something the kids will enjoy, do a search of Tom Chapin's stuff (especially ""My Hometown"" and ""Family Tree"")."
2,Not his best work,"I found this album to be far less interesting than i had hoped. I love HCJ and the list of songs seems full of exciting potential but i found the execution to be lifeless and rather dull. I was so disappointed because i enjoy his music so much. I'd skip this one and opt for Blue Light, Red Light if you don't already have it. It's old but still one of my favorite albums ever."
2,a real disappointment,"I bought this for a 40 plus on his birthday. It was a flop as a gift. If anyone has really enjoyed these tunes in the past, they will not appreciate the way Connick has jazzed them up."
3,Very nice CD,"Harry Connick, Jr. and Brian Evans are pretty much the only real relevant crooners of this generation. I believe Harry's CD keeps your fingers snapping and allows you to do the dance in style."
3,I wanted so much more.,"My wife and I are big Harry Connick, Jr. fans and we recently saw him in concert touring this album and 30. I purchased both for my wife as a gift and 30 is pretty good, but Songs I Heard was less than I expected.I really wanted the CD to be great but it's just okay. Trust me it's not easy for me to rate one of his albums this way, we have been fans since the beginning. I'm not saying it's bad, just not great.If you have to choose, buy 30 and skip Songs I Heard!"
3,Wasn't what I had pictured.,"This Cd is full of kids songs from kids movies sung in a jazzy H. Connick Jr. style. My kids like the songs they recognize (which is about 1/2), but I'm not a huge fan. It just wasn't what I had pictured."
3,Like Turning the Crank,"I read a lot of Alan Dean Foster's books and usually enjoy them. This is a collection of very short stories, all with a common structure and feel. Build to the ""trick"" at the end. Some were a lot of fun with real surprises at the end. However, many had nothing new to say. Felt like they were written to fill space.This book did give me something to do while waiting for the next Finx and Pip book to be released."
5,Excellent display of Enge's early work.,I bought this CD just to get his rendition of Funny Familiar Forgotten Feelings. Worth the purchase just to have this track. Beautiful as always.
2,Great show -- rotten singing,"Chorus line is a great show to watch, but the music is not very good and most of the female singing on this disc is abominable -- harsh, unattractive and unmodulated. As Broadway musicals go, this is one whose cast cd should be avoided."
2,mixed up order,When I ordered this itemI expected to receive a DVD not a CD. I am very unhappy and would like to correct this mistakeI wanted a dvd and not a CDThanksMike Kelehan
4,Great Recording,This recording is a great showcase of the wonderful songs in A Chorus Line. It would be better if I understood German but it is still very enjoyable. The people on the recording are in great voice and this is a keepsake that I will cherish forever. A Chorus Line was my first Broadway show (that I saw) so I own every recording. I highly reccomend this even if you don't know a word of German you still know what there saying (becuase everyone has heard these songs)
1,stupid sony drm,"Great recording, but if you want to actually use it, like load it on your ipod it has sony's stupid DRM. Meaning you can't. DON'T BUY SONY PRODUCTS!!"
1,Poor service from supplier,The CD was unplayable and we received no response to our emails to the dealer.
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I must say I don't like this musical at all. I wish Chicago would have swept the Tony Awards that year. I understand it is a favorite to many, but not to me. It's boring, too short and well...the movie doesn't matter, does it?"
4,Very enjoyable.,I have always loved this musical. This brought back so many great memories for me. Wonderful.
3,great machine--hard to clean,A really heavy duty lifetime machine. Juices vegetables unbelievably well and fruit less effectively. Only problem--extremely difficult to put together and take apart for cleaning--so I end up not using it much unfortunately.
1,cheap,Received this product and was very disappointed. The quality was very poor. The paint was uneven and very sloppy. Do not recommend this product. Good thing Amazon has a fast and easy return policy.
5,"Yoga: Mind, Body, and Tortued Soul",I chose this rating because this has become one of my favorite foreign horror movies. I really liked the story and the cast. I would recommend this movie to any horror movie fans. I am really pleased with my purchase.
4,Twisted.,"Vain women get together in a crazy house that promises the secret of beauty through yoga. The headmistress puts them through a nightmare week of hell and rules that they all end up breaking because they're knuckleheads. It's very boring at first, but hits you in the face with insanity about halfway through. It can be incoherent and implausible from start to finish but that's fine because I've just come to expect that from K-horror. This is definitely one of my favorites in the genre."
1,DON'T waste your money,This has to be one of the dumbest movies yet. Don't waste your money on this crap. A two-year old could have made a better movie. The only reason I gave it one star is because it would not let me give it no stars.
4,Nice watch,I am happy with this watch. The clean design is good and the quality issues that others mentioned are not apparent with the watch I received.
2,Problems with the armband.,"The armbands on these watches are not on hinged pins, but attached directly to the housing of the watch. That makes them prone to breakage, and when they break they are almost impossible to replace. I've found quite a few stores that sell Skagen watches but none that sell Skagen armbands. I've been told that I would have to send the watch in, which would take 4-6 weeks and cost more than half the original sale price of the watch. Great design, but I'm not going to buy another Skagen watch!"
5,Learn about a life,"Disclaimer: I know Ed. I have flown with Ed. I've been out drinking with Ed. I like Ed. So the book gets five stars. But I could have just not written a review. Instead I want to share with you that this book is like getting to listen in on the story of a life, told first-hand by a real straight-forward all-American mountain-climbing airliner-flying legless man. Ed lost his legs in a harrowing five days spent on the side of Mount McKinley following a crash in a small plane he was piloting. Ed hit lows of VA hospitals and cheap beer. Ed now is a pilot for American Airlines, and still climbs big mountains. I learnt a lot about his life that I didn't know after flying with him for a month. It's not platitudes, or deep thoughts, but it is real. And it sounds just like Ed talking, not some fancy tarted-up bookish words. It was well worth my time to read it, and if you've never flown with Ed, it should be worth your time and money to see what you have missed."
1,Kat's 13222 2000 Watt Alumininum Circulating Tank Heater,"The engine heater was quickly delivered but is not yet installed. Why? First, because the installation is considerably more complex than one would imagine, including complete draining and partial modification of the engine cooling system -- a fact that could have been made clear in the catalog. Second, the installation requires parts that were not included with the product, and that I have no idea where to find. Third, I am not at all sure I am willing to risk the operation of a very expensive engine on such an apparently flimsy product. At a minimum, I would consult the vehicle manufacturer before attempting to install for fear my warranty would be invalidated. In summary, I rate this purchase a ""gotcha"" and it has left me much less willing to buy ANYTHING again on the Internet that I have not previously physically examined."
1,Not great quality,"I ordered 2 pairs of these. One pair (oxford gray) was perfect, however the other pair (black) had one leg 2-3 inches longer than the other leg. Definitely not first quality."
5,Great sweat pants,"I ordered these last year and was so happy to see them again. Warm, comfortable and fit great."
2,Good & Bad,"Beautiful photographs of rugs in many different styles. The photos and information couldn't be better....however, my book has fallen apart after browsing through it only a few times. This is so upsetting, it's hardly useable."
3,Beginners Beware/Great Book,"This is a great book that will certainly get your imagination working overtime. Good for inspiration, but only the more advanced turners could probably be successful at any of these projects. Not to mention a few specialty tools or if you already have a large variety of tools to work from. With about five years experiance and making many complex pieces, this was still a bit over my head, or maybe because of being limited by my lathe and tool selection. BUT I got some great ideas from this book that have ""turned"" into some nice pieces. I will conquer a few of these prodjects but for now I'll keep turning..."
4,Good Heater but watch the installation.,These heaters work very well and are durable if you install them correctly. I had two fail in my Compact Tractor because the Tractor Mechanic installed them incorrectly. I found out from the Manufacturer that it is critical to install them with the Thermal Sensor body facing DOWN. My first one burned up because it was installed facing up and this HEATS THE SENSOR TOO MUCH and makes it fail. My second did not work so I investigated and found that the mechanic plugged it in DRY (no water) before instaling it to see if it worked. He did not realize that this burned it up quickly so he put it in tractor. I explained all this to the Tractor Service center Owner and the third one was installed correctly and has worked fine for 3 years now. The heater works perfectly if you turn it on at least 3 hours beore you need to drive your vehicle. I put mine on a timer.
4,A good DVD with one flaw,"I agree with most of the other reviewers on this title, but there is one thing that is annoying about it. You do have the capability of watching just the performances without the documentary footage, however, the performances have a gap after each song. This is because they have set the menu up where all of the songs are one chapter with the individual songs being titles within that chapter. This means that you lose the feeling of a live show somewhat because each song ends and then your player will have about a 2-3 second break as it jumps to the next song. This would not be such a big deal except that some of the songs go right into each other and it really detracts from the flow of the show. They really should go back in and re-edit the footage where it flows seamlessly as it does on the Godsmack-Live DVD. With that said, the footage and sound quality are great overall and I would have probably given it 5 stars if not for the annoying editing of the performances."
4,Godsmack Kicks Butt,"Great DVD. Good concert footage, good sound. Loved the behind the scenes and interview footage."
3,MORE ROCK LESS TALK,Too much talking and interviews. I just wanted to watch them live.Made for poor entertainment with a large crowd.
5,Grip it and Rip it !,"I've always enjoyed Godsmack's music - but haven;t listened in some time (own the first 2 offerings).Rented this on a whim - simply unforgettable!Perhaps the best concert heavy rock footage I've seen in quite some time.The sound (tone) that they got off the board for this was just....unbelievable. The concert itself totally rocked - what can you say - these guys are die-hard rockers from Boston. 'Nuff said.Sully is a music machine - can't stress this enough - the guy is gifted.Shannon - probably the hottest drummer I have seen in 10+ years.All of the members have that rare quality of musicianship without the burden of elitism so often seen with today's ""educated musicians"" - you know, the Berklee folk? - yup.Godsmack is the latest saviour of hard rock/metal.Get this DVD, stick it in La Machina and crank it - you won't be disappointed."
3,Good Frampton work,Only reason it's 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because of the lack of live tunes. Good album if you wanna get the whole Frampton feel.
2,very average,Peter Frampton is one of Musics Greatest Mysterys? how in The World did He Blow up so big? I'll Give him a couple of songs&what not but his Music is Pretty Weak on a whole.not much of A vocalist and the music is Sounds rather Average.He was a Fore-Runner for Rick Springfield.and that's noy saying much.
3,"An OK collection, but there's a better option","This is a reasonable collection of some of Peter Frampton's best known singles and album tracks, but it inevitably gives only very superficial coverage of his long career. It would be OK for anyone who wants only a few examples of his work, but for those seeking a more comprehensive compilation, or indeed just better value, the double CD 'Shine on' is a far better choice. With a total of 30 tracks, including the full contents of 'Greatest hits', together with detailed notes and some interesting archive photos, 'Shine on' is the best Frampton collection currently available and costs only a small amount more than 'Greatest hits'. So do yourself a favor and buy it now. (Then when you've allowed that to rekindle your appreciation for Frampton, you can treat yourself to his early solo albums, which have now been remastered for CD.)"
3,Basic beginner's book,"This is a fairly nice book for those brand new to Wicca/Witchcraft. There is no depth presented in any particular subject covered, and the text is fairly brief when dealing with individual aspects. In general, the book is a very light overview of ritual tools, the god and goddess, and various concepts found in modern Wicca/Witchcraft.What I appreciated most about the book is that it is clean, well organized, and less fluffy than most beginner's books on Wicca/Witchcraft. However, the information is a bit too sketchy in many places, which made me often wonder how much the author actually knows about the subject herself.Despite this, the book is one that can be put on the list for ""newbies"" with little need for concern about misinformation. However, as with all books, the reader must be careful not to take everything as ""gospel"" in this book."
5,great examples,"After years of research, it's nice to pick up a book like this that is just a great read. You get some great ideas from it, and it is entertaining. It's a spiritual experience just to read the material presented here."
2,Sketchy at best,"While this book is well organized in its presentation of material, the information itself is quite brief and sketchy. In addition there is really nothing new here that has not been rephrased time and time again in every beginner's book over the past two decades.If you're looking for yet another beginner's book to add to your library, then here is one more for your collection. But if you're looking for something new, you'll need to keep looking."
3,"Well written, but already done.","While this book is full of beautiful prose, no new information is presented. This book provides a very general overview of the craft. I would recommend this book for the very new seeker or perhaps to our always well meaning, but non understanding family. I do not recommend this for the serious researcher."
1,Umm...alrighty then....,"Here is more of the ""make it up as you go along"" variety of Wicca. As with most books written today on Wicca, the author mixes up a batch of ""instant Wicca lite"" and serves it with a big ladle. Today Wicca seems to be whatever anyone feels it is at any particular time of day. This ""blind leading the blind"" approach to Wicca is very puzzling, but seems to be what people want.So, if you don't really care what Wicca is truly about, and want just another idea whipped up in someone's backroom overnight, then this book is as ""good"" as any."
5,On a par with Starhawk and Scott Cunnignham,"This book was so beautifully written that it took me right out of myself. As a newcomer to witchcraft and wicca it was a joy to read something which not only answered all my questions, but was a pleasure to read. Here you will find information on every aspect of the craft including ritual, moon phases, magical equipment and the sacred seasonal festivals. Ellen Hawke manages to give detailed and reassuring information without talking down to the reader. The book flowed beautifully from start to finish. I particularly liked the personal approach which gave you a glimpse into the way the author works including her covens, celebrations and the way she celebrates the eight sabbats within her community as well. This book is accessible, poetic and inspiring. I look forward to her next offering."
3,"Decent, but you can do better","The Flipster looks cool, pretty much like a clamshell cell phone. It works well, too, playing specially encoded video files (a conversion tool for Windows is included) as well MP3, WMA and AAC music files. You can also load various picture formats on the 2.5"" screen, which is smallist. But seriously, this is really a half-cripped WinCE device, so for this money you might as well get a Pocket PC that has a built-in SD slot. For example, the Toshiba e755 has both SD and CF slots and can thus support up to 2GB of storage (or more in the future), and comes with wi-fi, AND is cheaper than the Flipster... and, of course, the e755 is a Pocket PC so it can do much more. If the Flipster were hard drive-based, it could be cool for my money. As it is, it arrives too late with too few functions."
5,A Great Place to Start,We were looking for a beginning level Religious Ed.type of book for our pre-k child. This is exactly what we were looking for. I was expecting when I ordered it for it to be a story of sorts. But it's not set up that way. It's set up so that each page is a seperate lesson/topic. Having the lesson ideas so short is great for the pre-K level child they can grasp the message quickly and you can elaborate in your conversation with the child. It's been a big help to be able to refer to it during mass and remind our child to listen to the priest. We bought this book along with the 'Just Like Mary' and 'The Mass Book for Children' books. I'm very excited about these books as a set and anticipate graduating from one up to the next. It would have been nice to have been able to purchase them in a set.
2,Little Acts of Grace,This book was very small and the information covered were things most kids already know. It didn't go into enough detail to satisfy knowledge of all the concepts. My kids read it in about 5 minutes.
2,Whithered Grapes,"This bible study was highly disappointing. My study group was often confused how the verses selected applied to the stated title. Lessons were composed primarily of observation questions and rare application questions. This means the book fails in helping the reader understand, apply, and appreciate the fruit of the spirit.The study guide is also written with a definite gender bias against male readers. Several group members complained that it was a difficult study to do because of the mindlessness of the questions. To add injury to insult, the study shows signs of not having been properly proofread as incorrect homonyms show up in several of the lessons.Purchase something else."
3,When is it getting here?,Glad to find this one here however needed 6 copies for a group study and had to order from six different seller.5 of the books came in different days within two weeks from the order. Got refund for the one that did not arrive.Did not like the feeling that I had to check the mail box everyday. I did reorder the one last one from a different seller. It arrived within a few days. The book were new and in good condition. Overall happy with the book and frustrated with the waiting.Fruit of the Spirit: Growing in the Likeness of Christ : 9 Studies for Individuals or Groups (Lifeguide Bible Studies)
2,Okay!,"This book is okay to add to other books that teach a beginner about this type of craft. This book is about teaching you to use 3D to revamp certain things you might already have in your home. It absolutely not worth outrageous price it's being sold for. There are other books being offered that better. I have every book on this subject offered by Amazon, so I positive about my reviews."
3,3d decoupage,a good book giving ideas about how to decorate several things that don't look very nice to you any more by a real simple way that w'nt cost to look more elegant.
2,Tastes must differ...,"I want to say, tastes to differ - so perhaps some people would find this cookbook is practical, healthy, and do-able for fasting times. But honestly to me, the recipes that I tried were so bad that I couldn't eat the food, it would taste better for me to just go dry - fruits, nuts, salads, that type of thing. It is possible that people who are more used to blander foods may find this cookbook totally fine though - I just advise people to maybe find a way to try a recipe first before making the decision to buy it. If you need to fast and feel that if you put time into cooking you still want some flavor (otherwise finding it more worthwhile to just eat plain, dry foods at least), then just get a mediterranean cookbook and use the vegetarian recipes, many can be made vegan, and substitute canola oil for olive oil. With that said, this cookbook does have recipes for those trying to go oil free as well - so that is a bonus for anyone interested in that."
2,A disappointment,"To all those Amazon.com shoppers out there, don't be fooled by good reviews for products like this one. They're usually written by friends or those who have a vested interest in selling the product. I bought Ladino Lives! on the basis of the three 5 star reviews only to find that I'd been duped. Ladino music is traditionally beautiful but this recording is not. It's an amateurish production and the singer, who misses notes and has a blackboard-scratch voice, should give it up. The instrumentals are okay but can't compensate for the other failings."
1,This game won't work on all Macs,"After purchasing the game, I had trouble opening it, and kept getting a message saying ""this is not supported on your system"". So then I did a little research and found out that this game will not work on newer Macs at all. Of course this isn't explained anywhere in the product description, which is just annoying."
5,Good shorts,"I'm 6'1"" and the large shorts go right to the middle of my kneecap. I like longer shorts so I'll get the XL next."
1,too long,if i was nine feet tall and all legs these would be great. i'm six feet tall and the large goes well below my knees. and i don't have short legs. eat
3,If you are interested in the story between Irish and Mexicans...its ok,"If you are interested in the story between Irish and Mexicans...its ok, theres a lot of history backround and valuable information."
3,Informative history lesson,"Well written but repetitive in many instances. I found myself reading detail one chapter only to have the same detail repeated in a later chapter. Despite this the book is very interesting particularly to those with an interest in Irish history, and the role of the Irish in American history in the 19th Century."
1,massive amounts of hiss,"yes you can tweak it so its less, but you have to cut back on the distortion level to do so. so then why have a distortion pedal? pushed all the way for maximum distortion and volume the hiss makes this pedal unusable for recording. a gate wont do the trick because it will hiss regardless if your playing. really dissapointing pedal from mxr. their phase 90 sounds great, this thing is crap."
3,Just Pick Out Your Favorites,"For those who don't get British television (me included), this was something new: a look at the some of the highlights of long-running show hosted by Jools Holland. I'm guessing Holland has had a long-running music show with weekly guest, centered around rock `n roll.Anyway, it gave me an opportunity to see some people I've never seen performed as this DVD has over 20 performers filmed over the years. Everyone should have a least a half dozen songs they really like in here. My personal favorites, for either the great song they did or the fact it was fun to finally seem them perform, were: Leonard Cohen, Jeff Beck, Robert Plant/Jimmy Page, Bob Diddley, R.E.M., The Kinks and Ian Dury. Of that group, I think Bo Diddley's number was the most fun.Somone mentioned you can only see this in Region 4. Well, I live in Region 1 and saw this and the disc played just fine."
4,"NOT ""ALL REGIONS""","Even though Amazon advertises this as being for ""All Regions"" it is for Region 4. I had to change my DVD player from Region 1 to Region 4 (Australia). Warning: It is only possible to change regions a couple times. After that your DVD player will be permanently set at whatever region you set it to when the device stops allowing the switch. All that having been said I enjoyed all the performances but I don't think it's worth $30 sum dollars especially since there is the Region issue."
3,Strength & Speed Training for Athletes,"Excellent information on strength & speed development for the contact athlete......however there is no particular info that pertains to rugby itself. There is no specific exercise or training for front row, locks, etc. just a well rounded and generic strength training manual"
2,A Half-hearted Cashing-in Effort...!,"KISS' successful reunion in 1996 has triggered a sudden wave of the so-called 'KISS experts'. These 'experts' tried their best to cash-in from the rejuvenated KISS mania that soared the demand for KISS memorabilia. This book is a perfect example of those who want to milk KISS fans for the money. There's no new story inside, no shocking truth, no new facts, even no new pictures. This book is more like a photo book, with giant pictures and little stories in between. Most of the photos came from the Creatures promo tour in the U.K. Most KISS fans must have read all those old stories and facts billion times by the time they read this book. Even worse, the discography section of this book is incorrect."
2,Good for a historical overview BEFORE your trip.,"This book is more of a novel of these three cities. Don't expect to pick up this book for the first time while you are on the trip and pick out places to see. The sites are buried in paragraph after paragraph of text, which is not very useful when you are there and trying to figure out what not too miss. Read it before you go on your trip and make notes of the places to visit. We were looking for the book to include a bullet list of some type with the ""must see"" places in each city. With only this book as a reference, we decided to wing it instead of reading."
3,Not a Christmas Story...,"I like to collect Christmas books with cat themes. I purchased this book based on a parenting magazine review indicating that it was a good Christmas story. While the story is pleasant and the illustrations are lovely, the only Christmas reference is that the kitten was found on Christmas. All in all, if you want a simple storybook that has beautiful illustrations, it is a good choice. But if you're looking for a Christmas story, keep looking."
1,Wrong Cable,"I order this cable because I needed a usb camera cable for finepix A201 model. So I order it because I was sold by the product description which they mention this model. Well, the cable is not even compatible to this model, it doesn't even fit into this camera, its to big. I'm SO Disappointed."
4,Start Strong Finish Weak,"With the exception of Ty Cobb, the first 7 songs are 5-star caliber. ""Burden in my Hand"" is excellent. Don't listen to all that editorial comment on sadness, dark, etc. - it is good work. The album is worth buying but the last few songs do not really stand out."
3,Garden going dry,"Final release from grunge godfathers wasn't quite the follow-up to their ever-praised SU fans would wish for, but holds enough satisfying material which grows into its own eventually to be a worthy outro, if barely."
3,a bit disappointing,Down on the upside is at best a mediocore album from soungarden compared to other albums llike superunkown.this album is recommended to grunge fans
3,Not As Hard As The Others,"Down on the upside is a fair cd. This cd is slow and tired out. But other soundgarden cd's like superunknown, and badmotorfinger are hard and drilling. This cd is just a sign that soundgarden is getting old, but that doesn't mean that there music can just go bad. There are some good songs on the cd like blow the outside world, and pretty nosse. I heard a rumor that soundgarden is getting back together again, i don't know if it's true tough. This cd is not soundgarden's best. This is the worst soundgarden cd ever. You should get superunknown first, and then get badmotorfinger, and just for the hell of it get down on the upside."
2,down on the up side,The cd was of poor quality I actually ended up tossing it in the garbage due to the quality . I wish I could send it back but it's not worth it
4,Saved the best for last...,"This is definitely better than Badmotorfinger and Superunknown (which I have). I can't prove it, but I'm pretty sure it's also better than Screaming Life/Fopp, Louder than Love, and Ultramega OK (which I don't have).Don't get me wrong, I love Badmotorfinger and Superunknown, but to me, this disc is simply better. True, it does contain more ""filler"" songs than the others, but the best songs here are better than the best of the others...and there are more of them.Worth buying for: Rhinosaur, Zero Chance, and Blow up the Outside World (there are other excellent tunes, but these three make it worth the price)Icing on the cake: Pretty Noose, Burden in My Hand, Switch Opens, Overfloater, Boot Camp, Dusty, No Attention, Never NamedCould have done without: An Unkind, Applebite (I'm not big on 5 minute instrumentals), Ty Cobb (although I love the first 25 seconds...)"
4,expecting better,"Back when superunknown came out, i was really blown away by how great that album sounded like. When I got down on the upside, i was a little dispointed. The album didn't seem as strong as superunknown though there are still great songs like blow up the outside world and ty cobb. It's just that the band could have written something better."
2,An undignified end to a great band,"It was always gonna be hard to follow up a classic like 'Superunknown', but Soundgarden well and truly fell flat with this rather limp effort. Its a tired album, lacking any spark whatsoever, and DOESN'T get better with repeated listens, in my humble opinion. Listen to Badmotorfinger or Superunknown, and then this. There really is no comparison. This is rehased, tired, limp. It seems the band were really struggling to come up with songs. It would have been much better for them not to release reputation sullying album and go their seperate ways. If you're looking to get into Soundgarden, avoid this album. Check out 'Superunknown' instead and work from there."
5,Amazing Collection - My Children Love It!,"I have all four sets in the series and truly feel that this was one of the best purchases I've made for our 'family' in a long time! The words are included and while we drive, my 8- and 10-year-olds concentrate on singing along with the artists. Some tracks are powerful, others comforting - but all are enlightening and great to sing along with! Many were familiar from Vacation Bible School. I was looking for a CD that would 'bring the music home'. These CD's travel from car to house and back again every day. You will not be disappointed!"
1,Ouch!,I didn't like this book because the author really tore Disney down. Being a big Disney fan I didn't like that very much. This guy obviously didn't like the show. If you want good reading read The Official Mickey Mouse Club Book.
4,Memories brought back,"This book did bring alot of memories of my school days, back in that period things were slower and so much fun. I related to the separation of religion, and perjudiced during that time, but all in all it was very good times. Everyone should read it and go back to those days and just remember them as i did.I hope the writer of this book shares another experience of those days, which were the best for us back then."
4,A Readers Comment,"The book ""The Reunion"" By Leonard Grossman,brought back memories of my school years. It was great,easy going,wanting more type book. It made me smile,laugh and even brought tears to my eyes."
5,Nostalgic,"I have just finished reading The Reunion and Leonard Grossman did a great job, taking me back to the 50's when I was in High School, Football Games, Parties, that special guy. Being Jewish is very special and it really took me back reading about the preperations for the Passover Meal. I loved the ""50's"", it was a great era and a great time to be a teenager."
5,The Reunion,I enjoyed The Reunion a story and time i can relate to as i grew up in the 50s . It brought backlots of memories of a much slower and fun time . Made me laugh and made me cry and brought back memories of loves and feelings of long ago. I sincerly hope Leon writes more books for us to enjoy.
4,To the 1st review...,"The 3-barrel ""curlers"" are used only for crimping. Even in the title it states that it is a ""Wigo Ceramic 3-Barrel Waver."" I don't think you should be going around rating products a 1-star just because you failed to read the description properly."
1,Not what I expected,"I was expecting something that was going to curl my hair and instead it just ""crimped"" it."
4,almost perfect,"I wish this well illustrated catalogue raisonne included the information for all prints in the editions rather than just the ones belonging to Sorlier. Many of Sorlier's prints are ""HC"" prints or ""Epreuve de collaborateur"" prints in which case you may have to seak another source to discover the edition numbers for the specific print you're researching. Other than that - nicely illustrated (though the illustrations are small, it is not designed as a book to showcase the prints as reproductions) and chronologically arranged."
3,Not for the Collector!,"THIS DOES NOT CONTAIN THE COMPLETE LITHOGRAPHIC WORKS OF CHAGALL.THERE IS NO INDEX.After your third or fourth search, you will find 2 out of 3 lithographs, and never the one that's really important to you.The information is cryptic, but very complete when it's there.You will see the lithographs in better shape than you could possibly hope for, with personal messages to those lucky Sorliers.I almost returned it -- I even printed out the return label -- but sometimes I found what I needed to know, knowing that I could never find that crucial detail anywhere else. And the print job is way above and beyond. I'm still stunned that it's available for under $100!"
5,Pleasant Surprise,"This product arrived in less than a week. The seller sent an email with contact info if anything went wrong but I didn't need to contact them. This has a very sturdy pendant. The chain is strong enough to do the job, and doesn't look ""cheap"". There is no clasp on the chain, it has to slip over the head. It measures 24 inches long. I wear it all the time except in the shower. I don't know what kind of metal it is made of and I don't want it to tarnish. It is long enough to fit under most of my shirts and blouses without being seen. I feel I got more than my money's worth with this medical alert necklace."
5,Exactly what I needed,"I turned to amazon.com first when looking for a style manual for the engineering field. Found this, ordered it, and have used it often already. It is absolutely what I needed. So glad I found it."
2,just view the excerpt,"I encourage you to view the excerpt of this book; it will help you, more than any customer review, to see if this book is what you expect or imagine. In the excerpt, I found that chapter 2 starts with a bulleted list of items, without any introduction, any motivation, any explanation, nor comment, exactly like a table of contents. Next, using the same style (bulleted list or table of contents), ""develops"" each item of the bulleted list. I feel that this type of book would not give much help to write anything. To buy this book is like buying a power point presentation."
5,Teacher's Choice,"An absolutely beautiful book! This picture book is a favorite with my kindergartners each year. The watercolored illustrations allow us to peek at the artist's life, ""meet"" his family, and share in the joy of art. We love to study the paintings and look for the subtleties which Catalanotto includes in his work, (students are excited to see a picture of the dalmatian from Dylan's Day Out on the studio wall). We talk about the daughter's disappointment when daddy can't play because he's painting, but we feel her happiness when he's dancing with her after lunch (the most breathtaking painting in the book). Young readers love the watercolor by the daughter at the end; my kindergartners are inspired to paint the same rainbow and birds for the rest of the school year! Every primary teacher should have this wonderful book as part of the classroom library. Curriculum connection: art, family, love, artists and painters, parents who work at home."
2,don't waste your time or money on this book,"The book's content is inspirational but it provides no practical information. The author makes enormous claims of offering some secrets to establish wealth but ends up just rambling. Many of the book's chapters are just redundant. After reading the book I felt that I had been conned out of my money. It took about 2 hours to read the whole book and I could've spent the time better doing something else. The author wastes time going into detail explaining businesses of his that failed in the past. This book gives a good ""pep talk"" to get your motivated but if you're looking for actual secrets or guides to establishing wealth then you won't find it here.After reading the book I did some research on the author, Gerard Spinks. Although early in his career he made millions of dollars in a dotcom business, he later lost all of his money and was homeless just prior to writing this book."
5,Sony DSR 45,Both seller and machine were a pleasure to deal with. the DSR 45 is a great machine which worked 'out of the box' as most Sony pro products do.
2,Below Average,"BH-700 is a good looking light weight headset.I've used it with many mobile phones & I've found that its performance is bad for the following reasons:-Range is about 2 meters (6 feet) only. Nokia claims 10 meters (60 feet).-Range goes down to 1 meter (3 feet) if not fully charged, and disconnects even if it were in your pocket-Continuously disconnects from the phone-Not comfortable fit.I don't recommend it."
4,Great Product; Well Worth IT,"I love Nokia products and so specifically looked for a Nokia Bluetooth to work with my Nokia N800. I was having trouble with the headphones that came with it when I use Skype. The BH-700 is amazing. There is a little static sometimes but overall it is great. The volume control is great. It fits very nicely into my ear, but my wife says it is too big for her. I read other reviews that said it would not go far but I set the N800 in the middle of a classroom I was cleaning and was able to walk the entire room without interuption. The best thing about it is that I can just turn it on and off and it automatically links to the N800. It is a great product, which I would recomend for any Nokia lover!!!!"
2,"Not great, by any means","I bought this headset for my nokia n95, which after some shipping complications, was delivered in the original nokia packaging just as described. It linked up quickly and without issue, but that's pretty much where the good ended. The headset is nothing but static unless the phone is within about a foot of the earpiece. If you keep the phone in your pocket, forget it. Keep on lookin..."
2,Dissapointed,The ear piece is impossible for me to fit into the ear. It's way to big and it hangs outside. I cannot rely on the hook to fix it on my ear. It's way to loose and practically decorative. I think that it's mostly designed for men.
2,Not so great fit,"After a lot of research I bought BH700 as my bluetooth headset. I had high hopes for this NOKIA product because I am big fan of NOKIA Phones. I was disappointed with the fit of the headset, I think it is made for people with big ear canal. The earbud does not fit securly in my small ear (with or without the loop). The bulk box product does not come with extra earbuds (I am not sure if complete box comes with it or not) and it such a bad fit that I had to get another one. It has a great sound quality but nothing out of the world. I bought Jabra BT8040 and it is the best fitting in-ear headset that I have ever seen."
1,returned it...,"I returned this a week after I got it. Although the sound quality was good, the ear bud was just too big, and got painful after a while ( I wear it constantly) or fell out a lot. The earloop was useless. I also did not like that the answer/end button was right on the other side of the ear bud, so when I would (inevitably ) go to readjust it, I would accidentally either call or hang up on someone.... I'm shopping now for something better.. too bad, I've always sworn by Nokia."
4,Nokia or Jabra,"1. I decided to switch from Jabra to Nokia why?2. May07 Purchased JX10; 2 problems; first one the charge; need to charge after one day-talked time around 20 minutes. The dealer changed it. The second one now after 6 months it is not accepted to charge.3. I understand that the warranty for 2 years.4. So, I decided to switch to Nokia and gave myself the chance to find out other brands5. I agree that BH-700 for security pairing is different than I used to.6. As I am just purchased Nokia two days before so, need to wait one month to give full opinion. But first impression within two days all my calls went smooth without received any comments from other partners7.I am using its ear hook; it is comfortable"
1,Who Designed This?,"I saw this ipod case online and it was exactly what i was looking for - I loved the design. When I received it I discovered that you can't access the on/off button when the ipod is in the case. So, then what is the point? Also the quality of the product wasn't good. I was really disappointed and then spent a lot of time and effort returning the product to PC Universe. They were accomodating only in the end but they gave me a hard time."
2,Dissapointment,"In the past few months, I have gotten super into all of Devendra's other works, and was excited for another little delicious surprise like the others when I first picked this album up. Oh, what a dissapointment I was in for. The album does not carry through it's energy as many of Banhart's other albums do so well. Also, having already heard many other versions of the same songs that are on here on his split album with Jana Hunter, I found these to be much more dull, and did not carry forward their emotion in the way that the other recordings do. That being said, Devendra is always quite alright, if not wonderful. I find his voice to be entirely charming, and he is generally a very talented song writer.So, the moral? If you couldn't really get into this recording, please don't give up on Devendra yet. I highly recommend ""Cripple Crow"", his split album with Jana Hunter, and, if you are into music that is slightly more raw, ""The Black Babies"", which is my personal favorite."
1,music?,"Is there someone who can explain me why we can call ""this"" music? Honestly, if i want to hear a sheep bleat, i take my car, drive it to the mountains and listen these beautiful animals sing! But please, not Devendra Banhart! Bye bye.......or beeeeee beeeeeee"
1,Insulting,"Do you think if I wrote some nursery rhyme lyrics from bizzaro world and starting singing in a voice more suited to Sesame Street that I could get a record contract too like Devendra Banhart? His record has to be some kind of inside joke, or the efforts of one seriously untalented individual. Sprouting nonsensical phrases one after the other might pass as genius among some people but I want a bit more substance to my music. I found this record personally insulting because it's obvious that someone out there felt you can just put out any old crap filled with ""strange and fantastic"" lyrics that are ultimately meaningless and people would evitably go out and buy it because it's 'unique' and that your uncool if you don't get 'it' (whatever 'it' is). If you want to listen to a quality record by a singer-songwriter than go check out Bright Eyes' ""I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning"" or Damien Rice's ""O"" and steer clear of this insult to good taste."
4,Some Good Hits,"This is a preliminary review made before I've had a chance to hear the music. I wanted to provide the song list:1. Wooly Bully - Sam the Sham and the Pharroahs2. Come on Down to My Boat - Every Mother's Son3. Mendocino - Sir Douglas Quintet4. Double Shot (of My Baby's Love) - Swingin' Medallions5. Sunday Will Never Be the Same - Spanky and Our Gang6. Let It Out (Let It All Hang Out) - The Hombres7. Apples, Peaches, Pumpkin Pie - Jay and the Techniques8. No Time Like the Right Time - The Blues Project9. Keep on Dancing - The Gentrys10. Teen Angel - Mark Dinning11. Hair - The Cowsills12. Society's Child - Janis Ian"
3,OLDIES CD,"THIS IS A GREAT ONE HIT WONDER WITH ""LET IT ALL HANG OUT"". THE SONG IS WHAT WE BOUGHT IT FOR AND HELPS COMPLETE OUR LARGE SELECTION OF MUSIC. I DON'T MIND BUYING A CD JUST FOR ONE SONG SINCE I CAN COPY THE ONE SONG TO MAKE A VARIETY CD. IT'S A KEEPER."
4,I'm looking forward to the followup.,"I see early Jeff Beck all over this album, not only in the guitar playing, but also in the writing style, and that's meant as a compliment. Actually, Pati's guitar playing is much more fluid than early Beck's.I'm looking forward to the followup."
1,False Advertisement,Oh My Glob! I ordered this product thinking that i was buying what the picture had shown. WRONG!!!!!!!! i got a red nail polish! The picture it showed of the item was completely different! I'm so disappointed!!
2,Doormat,"The doormat looked beautiful but one of the swirls had what looked like a crack in it. Rather than drag it back to the post office and shipping it back, I put it out. Sure enough, a few weeks later I was standing on it and the piece cracked off. My own fault for not sending it back in the first place."
1,Disappointing,Extremely disappointed with this mat - expected it to be heavy duty but the paint chipped within 1 week. Of course it's too heavy to mail back.
5,"Thorough , Timely and Powerful !!!!!","We are extremely blessed to have this book in our library. We are the parents of two teenage boys who are really feeling their harmones, but in discussing ""Sex and the Bible"" with them, they are committed to keeping Gods plan for their sexuality. Our family has lost loved ones to the AIDS epidemic and have witnessed some of our closest friends marriage end in divorce because of infidelity. This book isn't for teenagers only. It has caused me to reconsider some of my own preceptions. I thank God for Dr. Conaway and his insightful work."
4,another excellent pretty things album,"i don't think that this is quite at the level of s.f. sorrow, but it's still an impressive release. i don't think it was the best album of 1970, as rolling stone did back then , but its certainly a worthy addition to one's collection. parachute is, for lack of a better word, an often ""creepy"" album ( sickle clowns, cries from the midnight circus). the lyrics are great as usual- phil may has to be one of the most underrated lyricists of the era. the band is solid as always too. the bonus tracks are also good, with circus mind being the best in my opinion. parachute is an inventive and eerie minor masterpiece."
5,Very thorough,"for a new parrot owner, this was invaluable. despite everything i have found online over the last few months, having this resource at hand has been great. totally recommend."
3,"Compared to ""Guide to a well-behaved parrot""","I bought this book a few days back after being disappointed by the author's other book ""Guide to a Well-Behaved Parrot"" (see my review for the said book). It is significantly improved over the other book. It is better organized and contains more factual material, including sections on old and new world parrots (some general idiosyncracies). Whereas the previously reviewed book was very poor, this one rates average. It still lacks w.r.t. specificity, depth, and consistency. Maybe 7-8 pages (as opposed 1-2) will suffice to condense the information contained in the book. I also ordered another book ""Companion Parrot Handbook"" by S. Blanchard. That is a fantastic book (see my review for the said book)!"
2,Where's Real Men?,"How can a greatest hits of Joe Jackson not include ""Real Men""? I know you'll always get dissenters with a compilation album, but really! Guess you'll have to spend the extra for the 2CD compilation."
3,Not this one,"As a big fan of Joe Jackson's first half-dozen albums, I may not be the most impartial judge of a skimpy package like this. I'm used to hearing Joe arrange his songs into a mood-setting whole, either in concert or on his original albums. Early songs on ""Look Sharp!"" and ""I'm the Man"" were three-minute slices of punk-pop perfection and as such are well-suited to compilations, but the albums he created during the middle of his career were carefully constructed and orchestrated and really deserve to be heard in their entirety, particularly ""Night and Day,"" ""Jumpin' Jive,"" and ""Big World."" If you can, buy those albums, but if you must have a ""Greatest Hits"" volume, spring for the 2-CD ""Steppin' Out."" As brilliant as Jackson's individual songs can be, I just don't think you'll be satisfied with this limited hodgepodge."
4,He's the man.,"I have to admit, I was gonna just get ""Night And Day"" because all I thought I knew from him was ""Steppin' Out"". Thank god I got ""Greatest Hits"", since it is full of great songs, many of which I recognized well. I'm so glad this is in chronological order too. I really like every track here, but most 80's fans should easily know the excellent ""I'm The Man"", ""Is She Really Going Out With Him?"", ""Sunday Papers"", ""Nineteen Forever"", and ""You Can't Get What You Want (til you know what you want)"". Of course the cool ""Steppin' Out"" is on here also, as well as ""Breaking Us In Two"" from the same album. The styles of music may not be real consistent, but the quality of the songs surely is. Definitely an underrated artist."
3,quirky,"Looking around the net you will find mixed reviews about a lot of the ""palm-oriented"" map/travel software. Unfortunately this will be no different. The maps are fair but old. (many relatively new streets are missing)My copy is dated 2002 however I'm not sure the maps are actually that current. Using the find/search function is a pain and contrary to the hint which tells you to reduce your search info, I've found the opposite to be true. (note that leaving out rd or dr, or misinforming it of the suffix will often cause erroneus search results.) If you are able to list the city (don't leave it in ""all cities"") then it will sometimes find your target with the shortened search text. Mapopolis' search engine ran circles around this. In all fairness, I haven't used an advanced mapopolis-compatible map with more data. (I'd still bet it's faster)"
1,StreetFinder at a loss!,"Outdated! I can't find my own address, my mother's address, or my work's address! What's the point of it if I can only find the cities of where I'm going to, and not the street where it's at!? I ended up back at MapQuest.comIt's hard to use, hard to learn, hard to work with... Get a better product, I know I will."
5,Great protective case,"I had my seagate 160gb external hard drive for awhile and hesitated to purchase a case. Since I've been traveling a lot with it and felt that it's more susceptible to damage if I were to just leave it in my bag. Lint, dirt, and other debris might get lodged into the slots. Also I was afraid of bumping into something and damaging the drive since it holds so much valuable info. I've been using the case for about a month now and I have no complaints. The elastic strap is very sturdy and holds in drive in place. The additional mesh pouch is just the perfect size to hold the power cord. It's a little bit tight when I want to zip the pouch closed, but I prefer having it be a little tight than too loose where the drive and cord may go bumping around. So all in all, I'm very satisfied with this case. I recommend it to anyone that uses one of these types of portable hard drives."
2,Zipper Broke,"I've had this case for about a week and the zipper is already broken. It's nice and compact and fits my drive perfectly, and I love the color, I just wish the quality held up."
4,Good quality,"For the price this is a good deal. The padding could still be more to add extra protection.Should fit most 2.5"" external hard drive case."
5,Very nice case,This case is very well-built with soft lining inside to protect your precise hard drive. My 1TB WD Passport fits fine with room to spare. Recommended!
4,LaCie Rugged HD will NOT fit with drive AND cables!,"Let me first say that the case is nice enough, but after I opened up the box I knew my LaCie Rugged external HD wasn't going to fit inside this case...the drive itself will fit in it, but the cables and such won't ( which was the whole point in getting this case ).I ended up giving it to my fiance to use with one of her smaller external HDs.Just wanted to give fair warning to anyone else who was thinking about getting this case for the LaCie Rugged HD."
3,package deal bad deal in this case,"This item was offered as a package deal with the small projector... the projector does not fit the case.The case is good, but the package deal was not.... someone needs to verify when offering a package deal the items really do the job.I need to return this case, have no use for it."
4,It's good.,I bought this case with a western digital hard drive and it does its job. It is just the right size for the hard drive. It has an elastic band to secure the hard drive and a mesh pouch to hold small papers (post-it notes and little notepad papers) and the cord. I really like it.
3,case logic PHDC-1,It's a durable great product to protect external hard drive but a little too bulky for me to carry around.
4,Nice Case,This is very nice carrying case for portable drives. It's actually smaller than I envisioned and has everything you need for a portable carrying case. Highly satisfied.
3,Bigger for WD 120G hard drive,"I got a Western Digitial 120G hard drive and want to got a case for it. But this case is much bigger for it, even though it is said a small case. Otherwise, it is good in a whole."
1,too large for WD passport;,"This case is too bulky for 2.5"" HDD's like WD Passport. so, there should be a better fitting case available in Amazon."
1,SAD ... :(,I ordered this case with another one same size but Black in Color - RECEIVED BOTH BLACK COLOR .... Very Dissapointed...
1,It is too small for what it was suggested for,This case is too small and I cannot get my Seagate 1 Terabyte ST91000. . drive into it. It is listed as frequently ordered with the Seagate. I am trying to decide whether to return it or just throw it in the trash.
4,"Good quality, could be thinner","Good quality, good color. A little too big for the WD essential portable harddrive. Not a perfect snug fit. Could be thinner."
1,Worst case ever!!!,I got this case for my external hard drive. I just went to zip it up and it broke!!! So never buy this product it was a waste of my money and time.
3,Nice case but didn't notice it is only for 2.5 inch drives,This is a real nice case but I didn't notice it was just for 2.5 inch drives. I kept it because it was not worth the effort to return. Later I did get a small 2.5 inch drive and it came in handy. But even then not all 2.5 inch drive cases fit this case. The NexStar TX fits but the NexStar CX is too big.
1,Rip off,"This cast is sold stating that it will work with this HD., I will not, is is to small, making it a wast of money. Check out your recconendations more carefully."
4,Fits LaCie 500GB hard drive but not the cords,"Just thought others might like to know that if you are buying this to protect theLaCie Rugged All-Terrain 500 GB hard drive, it fits only the hard drive, not the cords. There are pockets inside for cords but you will not be able to zip the case closed with cords inside. This is due to the rubber sleeve on this particular hard drive. I was going to return the case, but since I couldn't find a slightly bigger case that would fit the cords along with the hard drive, I ended up sewing a pouch for the cords and attaching it to the zipper pull of the case. Despite this, the case does have a nice hard protective shell and I don't have to worry about dust and dirt getting into the ports."
5,Case Logic,"Se compró este estuche junto con un disco duro portatil de Toshiba, el estuche se ve de muy buena calidad, semirigido, no es suave, lo cual es muy bueno para proteger el disco, si se requiere se podría usar para llevar hasta dos discos, ya que éste cabe perfecto en ambos lados del estuche, de un lado tiene una cinta elastica y del otro una pequeña red.Muy buen producto, buen diseño, tamaño y calidad perfectas. Buena calidad."
1,Hate iT!,"Too Ginormous, For Portable HDDexpensive with shipping $17.00, No Cushions inside. Ugly Up close.nothing to hold."
1,I'm very unhappy,"I'm very unhappy about this product, especially the way Amazon handling my return. The way you promoted this item was very misleading. You bundled this item with WD MyBook hard drive together (I ordered this hard drive), but actually this case is not for that hard drive at all, and the dimension you presented was wrong. I returned the item, but Amazon deducted the return postage, I believe it is not fare. I wrote two emails to your customer service, but not hearing you back for a week.I used to trust your company, but now I have to re-evaluate Amazon."
5,Muy Bueno Excelente Producto y Material,"EL producto es muy bueno ya que esta conformado con nylon resistente recomendado para su fin, buen portador de discos duros. y protector a su vez."
5,Very Helpful!!!!,"If you have a Portable USB WD Hard Drive, this is the perfect partner. Good -looking, hard and easy-to-carry.The best way to secure your hard drive. I recommend it 100%!!!Best Regards/Saludos"
5,Great product!,"This case looks nice, and fits my Seagate portable hard drive perfectly. Definitely a perfect choice for me. I bring it everywhere and I know that my hard drive will be secure if I ever drop it."
2,"Good, but even checking the size didn't help","After reading several reviews (and it being clear that Amazon shares these over several similar products that aren't the same), I double-checked the case specs against the drive specs. The first thing I noticed was that changing the color changed the dimensions, so be aware of that.The case I bought says ""Fits hard drives up to: 6-Inch x 3.75-Inch x 1.25-Inch""The drive (LaCie Rugged) says ""Product Dimensions: 5.6 x 3.5 x 1.1 inches"" -- my ruler confirms these.No problem, right? And yet, the drive just _barely_ fits in the case, it's a bit of a fight to zip it, and there's no room for the cables. There's no way a 6"" drive would fit at all, since the _outer_ length of the gray hard shell is 6"".We can still use the case for something else, but not for this drive.Marked way down for saying it'll hold something it clearly won't."
4,Great deal,"i bought this item to my WD Passport Essential, it has a great design, it's like a hard case without leaving de desing behind, although it's a lit big for the disk but it keept it safe"
3,Don't buy for Iomega eGo Blue 320 hardrive for macs - won't fit!,"I bought this on the understanding that it fit well with the Iomega 320G eGo hardrive. It is too big which is disappointing. For the time being, I can still stuff everything in there and the zipper will close but it is a far cry from what I was expecting from a protective case."
2,Good Case Wrong Size,So when I went to purchase a portable hard drive - more specifically the Silicon Power Rugged Armor A80 1 TB 2.5-Inch USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 Military Grade Portable External Hard Drive SP010TBPHDA80S3B - Amazon suggested I buy this case to go with it... and I did... but it doesn't fit...too wide. Pissed. It's a good case for other things I'm sure.
4,Very good fit for my Seagate Freeagent GoFlex,Got this case after measuring my GoFlex 1TB drive every which way. I compared it to the one I had at work and thought it was the same. I also wanted a different color than the black (at work). Got everything I wanted. Fits the hard drive - even with the USB-3 adapter plugged in (without the actual cable). The little net on the opposite side of the case is perfect for holding the USB cable. Very pleased with the prompt shipping and the actual product/color/price.
1,Amazon bundles this case with LaCie Rugged and it DOES NOT FIT!,LaCie Rugged will not fit into this case but is advertised by Amazon to fit. The hard drive is slightly larger. Chose the LaCie case instead!!
4,Excellent product,it came brand new! doesn't have any scratch so it's a perfect buy and ideal for your hard drive it protect it a lot.
5,Case Logic Portab;e Hard Drive Case,"The Case works great in tandem with my Western Digital Passport portable hard drive. It is durable, lightweight and easy to pack. I would highly recommend this item."
3,two HDD in one case,this case is large size and can accomodate two WD passport HD... not recommended if space is a constraint. Buid quality is good and extra empty space on the edges (from inside) ensure safety in case of a bump. Carrying strap is missing from the design though.
3,Black Case,"Hard cover, well designed. A bit expensive but essential to transport and protect your passport."
5,Great case for any portable hard drive,This case works great with all of my portable drives. It even has a pouch inside to store the USB cable. I have used this case with WD and Seagate portable drives.
5,all around a great little great product,"all around a great little great product, a must have for a laptop size external hard drive."
4,Good Case,Bought it for my simpletech 250 gb drive. Fits the drive like a glove.Easy to carry around and really great product for its price.
4,tailed for your HD,"this case was perfectly made for my HDs, by WD and Toshiba. Very convenient, pocket for the device, another one for the wire. Easy to carry, and good protection for whatever is in. Go for it !"
3,Seem nice but didn't fit my hard drive as suggested,"It's a great case, soft and sturdy in the right places, but doesn't fit either my 500gb or 1tb lacie rugged drives as was suggested by Amazon."
5,What a great little case,I purchased this case in Magenta and love it. It is made of sturdy material and has plenty of room for more than one Wi Drive along with the plug and cord. When I saw the case on the computer I thought it would be made of soft material but it is not. It is very durable so your Wi Drive or what ever you put in it will be very well protected.I think this case will last a very long time which is good because it will be used a lot. I highly recommend this product for anyone who is planning to buy a Wi Drive or anything else that is small that would fit in it.
1,Not Right Fit,Bought it for hosting the Seagate 1TB External drive but it doesn't fit so now I am using it to hold sweets at the office.
4,Good protection for my hard drive,The case seems to be sturdy and I can fit two of my drives in it. I also like that it is different color since the majority of the cases are black. This way I know immediately which one is mine and which one is my husband's.
1,Broke the second time I used it,"Gave my wife a 1TB Passport drive for xmas wrapped in one of these.Used the drive to back up her computer. Repacked the drive in the case and the zip failed. No sticking or tugging involved. I carefully arranged the drive in the case, closed the lid, pulled the zip and could still see the insides of the case.Poorly made. I sent it back and replaced it with a Drive Logic DL-64 Portable EVA Hard Drive Carrying Case Pouch. (Can't insert a product link because the feature is broken AGAIN. Well done Amazon IT). I've used the Drive Logic case myself and recommend it to everyone."
3,"Cool look, but no padding. Too tall for WD My Passport.","I originally bought this for my WD My Passport for Mac. FYI, this case is considerably taller than those hard drives. A bit too much extra size for my taste - returned it and I bought the My Passport case made by WD instead.However, that's not an issue with the case, just an incompatibility with my hard drive. As a case, it has a nice look, and a hard exterior, but there's zero padding inside. I was expecting a bit of a cushion. I like the elastic strap though, and it has a good amount of room for one or two small cables. Overall, if you have a hard drive that needs a bit of extra space, and don't need much padding, this would be a fine case. But I wanted a bit more protection."
1,Disapointing,"Way too large for WD My Passport Drive!. Even with the elastic, the drive rattled around in the case. The Added webbed pocket for the wire was a nice touch, but I really did not feel that the case offered much protection. The case material is not cushioned either! I will be looking for something a good deal snugger! with some cushioning foam or rubber!"
1,Look for something else...,"The case has room for only the GoFlex Satellite HD with no room for the accompanying cables, which defeats the purpose of a storage case, since we now have to keep things in 2 places. The mesh pocket on the inside, which I assume was designed to hold power and connector cables, was torn and essentially rendered useless...moot point since this case has only enough real estate for either HD or cables.The only reason I got this is because the case from Seagate was sold out when I order the HD. Save yourself the disingenuous experience and avoid this offering."
4,"Good case, but too small for LaCie Rugged","Amazon pairs this with the LaCie Rugged as a ""frequently bought together"" deal, but the case is too small. While you can force the zipper to enclose around it, it does not sit completely inside the inner shell -- part of the unit hangs over the lip. And because of the LaCie's thickness, there is not enough room to store the cables inside the case. I wish I had known this before purchasing."
1,Red and Black are NOT the same case,"A month ago, I ordered this case in red. The Seagate external plug and play hard drive (both 250GB and 500GB) fit great. This black one that just arrived is much smaller both in length and width and the drives do NOT fit. Regardless of color, the product should be a standard size/ the same size."
1,does not fit,"I buy a Western Digital 500 GB My Book Essential 2.0 - USB 2.0 External Hard Drive and I buy it in a combo that bring these Case but it doesn't fit with the hard drive i buy, it is smaller. I don't know why they offer to sell you a combo with a case that doesn't not fit with the external hard drive you buy. They fool me, why should I Buy a Case logic portable hard drive that does not fit with the hard drive I buy?I am not satisfy with these and next time they offer me to buy what i want adding anything else i wont accept."
5,So practice and nice !,"I bought it for my Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex 500 GB USB 2.0 Ultra-Portable External Hard Drive STAA500100 (Black). Now, will betransportable and properly guarded or protected !Case Logic Compact Portable Hard Drive Case (Black)"
5,Fits my Western Digital Element hard drive,"Not much else to say about this aesthetically nice looking case but that my Western Digital Element external 500GB hard drive fits very well. It's not a negative, but it's a little on the thick side, but I expected that - see photos I uploaded."
5,Too small for latest drive,"First, this is a very nice product. The hard layer in the sides does a good job of protecting the drive, and it has the appearance of a quality product. There is an inside elastic strap to hold the drive and a mesh pocket for the usb cable.That said, it is just barely long enough to hold aSeagate Expansion 750 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive ST907504EXA101-RK. That unit is 5 3/4 inches long and also twice as thick as mySeagate Expansion 250 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive ST902504EXA101-RK. You have to jam it in there as you zip it shut. It does hold the drive and usb cable, but the corners are bulging a bit! Leaving out the cable doesn't help much.The 250 GB drive is an easy, loose fit."
5,Durable and protects your HD,"This was one of the better cases done by Case Logic. The exterior is hard and durable so it protects your HD from falls, there is a strap inside to keep it intact so it does not shake too in case there is a fall and there is a pouch where you can keep cleaning cloths or your connection cable. What I like about it is the size, other cases sold by case logic were a bit too big for the personal external HD but this one is small and the hard drives fit nice a snug inside, that way it doesn't take up too much space in your bag."
5,Serves its purpose,"Not much to report here, it serves its purpose, seems to be built fairly well so I doubt you will ever have issues with it falling apart."
5,Good Product,I bought the PHDC-1 Caselogic case to carry my new Seagate FreeAgent Go 250Gb portable drive. The case has an elastic band that holds the drive securely. There is a mesh pocket in the top half of the case to hold the USB cord. The product page has pictures of the case holding different portable drives for comparison. I bought the red case for visibility so I can find it easily. Check the different colors available because their price varies. Good product. I paid $10 new.
3,great product but bad combinations in recommended buy,"On a whole the product is good, its a material that seems cushion lined to reduce impact of falls. That;s about it to really say about the product but the bad side is where it is offered in recommended products with products such as ""Iomega eGo Desktop Hard Drive, USB 2.0, 1TB, Jet Black - 34269"" The problem is this case is not for made for 3.5 hard drives but for the smaller hard drives, hence it is impossible to fit the hard drive in the case, so it would have been a wasted buy, but i used it to store my mp3 and its connection cords as well as memory cards and camera batteries."
4,"Good little case, but nothing special - lacks padding","Bought this for a Seagate FreeAgent Go 500, and while it is adequate to the task and fits the drive nicely, it is nothing really special. I would expect there to be slightly more padding in something designed to hold something as precious as a drive. There is PLENTY of room in the interior, particularly on the ends, for the Seagate FreeAgent Go drive.Basically, this case will put about 5mm of material between your drive and the outside world - if it had some additional padding, I would have probably rated it 5 stars because the price is pretty good and the fit and finish is very high quality."
2,Great Case - doesn't fit the Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex,"Doesn't fit. Even though listed on the page with the hard drive. there is a connection for the cable (meant to stay attached) that doesn't fit in the case.the case is built well - but not intended, apparently, for the GoFlex."
3,good,it's a good case for the external hard drive i bought. and worth the money to protect it. i definitely would recommend it
4,Does the job,Small case for the portablity of the EVA external hard drive does the job perfectly and has the robustness for a lot of movement.
4,"Great Case, doesn't fit all Iomega eGo's","I purchased this case for theIomega eGo Mac Edition 250 GB USB 2.0/FireWire 400/800 Portable External Hard Drive 34648 (Alpine White)because it came recommended from Amazon and I checked the pictures and saw that the eGo fit perfectly. HOWEVER, the 250 gb is slightly too large for the case. It does not fit inside the inner lining but the zipper will close around it (which is why I chose it wasn't worth returning) The case is extremely durable and portable. My eGo came with 3 wires, two of them fit in the case, the third I don't really need to carry with me anyway. Great case, just beware that not ALL eGo's fit as well as you'd think!"
5,Excellent Customer Service,"I had one of these disappear from my doorstep courtesy of someone in my building who was kind enough to steal two of my deliveries. The guys from GizGalaxy were kind enough to replace the stolen item. Needless to say, I was pleasantly impressed with their service. I definitely recommend GizGalaxy to anyone purchasing this or any other item in their catalog."
1,Too Small for Portable Harddrive Ordered,"The Case Logic Case was a suggested purchase when I ordered my Seagate Portable Hard Drive. When it arrived, it was clearly too small. The 'big' problem is that it cost $8.40 in shipping to return while the item only costs around $10.00. Beware, do not buy this case, if you do, you will not be able to return."
5,Perfect Fit for Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex 1TB,I have the black version of this case and the Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex 1TB external hard drive with the connector attached fits absolutely perfectly.
3,Would've been nice if the case actually fit the external drive.,"I bought a Buffalo Technology MiniStation Metro 500 GB drive and purchased the Case Logic case through the ""frequently bought together"" link but I'm not happy I had to squeezed the drive into the case in order to close the case. I guess it's my fault for assuming that the case would fit the drive since it's being displayed as a optional combo purchased."
5,Great case and quality !,"this case is the one u need for any portable hard drive, it's big enough to fit my LaCie 320GB portable drive with extra space !highly recommended :)"
2,Beware following Amazon.com's advice!,"The issue was not the case, it is fine. Amazon.com paired it with the Hitachi Simple Tough portable hard drive but it does not fit! It seems Amazon justs put things it wants to dump with other products without checking to make sure they work."
4,good case selection,"A good choise. I would like it to be more padded inside, but a good choise anyway."
1,Did not receive it,"I do not know what happen, but this hard drive is over $ 100 with the case and it seems do not require signature. My package just disappear!!!!!! Why it notes that have already delivery!!!!!! I will never buy anything from this Store!!!!!!!!!!"
1,case logic hardcase,"I gave this one star because it was purchased on Amazon recommendation to fit the Seagate Expansion 1tb usb 2.0 portable hard drive. It does NOT fit this hard drive. I'm sure this is a good product but was not of use to me. Unfortunately, I had the case for awhile before I tried it and found it didn't fit. Be sure and measure hard drive and case before ordering."
2,still not received my product,"in transit from 11 January in Miami FL. still not received my product. WHY?. Estimated Arrival: January 10, 2011. I have no way to contact the seller."
1,misleading,This case was offered as a companion to the external hard drive that I purchased. The problem is that the hard drive does not fit in this case!
3,No way,"This case is too expensive compared to the price of the drive that obviously needs to go with. I say go somewhere else and get one, its just a ordinary case, not a rugged case that can prevent your drive from being destroyed, guys get something good....look around, you'll find some cheap ones, and different colours to match your case."
3,Too big for the HD Passport,The product is excellent. The problem is that the case is too big for the hard disk. Amazon should take care the combination of different product. I will prefer to buy next time when I see the product my self.
5,Perfect!,"Hecho a la medida, protege tu disco y te permite llevar algo mas, de manera comoda y segura!"
1,Amazon Recommended Case,"This case was recommended by Amazon with the purchase of an External Iomega drive. The external drive purchased is not portable, so this was a waste. Sure it would be fine for a true portable hard drive. Just make sure you read about each product."
4,Durable and Stylish Case,"I bought this case for a WD Passport external hard drive and so far it has been a great product. As is pointed out in several of the other reviews, the case is a bit too wide and tall for the newer, smaller drives but it hasn't been a problem for me yet.My only issue is that the cable included with the case is both very short (too short to be useful) and very sensitive to being bumped. It was a large enough problem for me that I bought a new cable. Fortunately though, the side pocket is easily large enough to hold a good sized cable and close without issue."
4,Good Case!,Good case! Can well protect the hard drive. The only thing I don't like is the meshed pocket inside the case. The sharp edges from the USB connector can easily scratch the hard drive case thru the mesh.
2,no fue del tamano que quise,"la compre junto con mi hard drive external pensando que la sugerencia para el case era la adecuado pero nada que ver me mandaron uno bien chiquito, tener en cuenta esas sugerencias"
5,EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED!,I use it for my Toshiba Canvio Plus 750 GB. it's a perfect match. Nicely designed and very protective. LOVE IT.
5,Does what it's supposed to!,"This case perfectly fits the Seagate Go drive. I can keep the drive on one side and the cable and other flash drives or cables on the other. You could even fit 2 drives, but probably couldn't fit the cables in as well. The only flaw? I wish it was even more rigid, but considering the price, it's a very good deal. Also, FYI-this is at least 25% off the prices at OfficeMax, OfficeDepot, and WalMart."
5,Perfect Portable Hard Drive Case,"The perfect size for Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Ultra-portable hard drives, which have interchangeable cable modules. In this case, I can hold a 1.5TB hard drive, USB 2.0/3.0 module, and eSATA module and cables!"
3,review,this item is not exactly what i want. it is not the size of my external hard drive. if it is not the exact product that fits to the external hard disk why do u keep in recommendation list.
2,Doesn't fit 1TB of seagate harddrive...,I just bought this case for my Seagate 1TB hard drive but it doesn't even fit it. It is well made what is the use if it doesn't fit??? Amazon should not recommend this...
5,Case Logic HDD case,The product is very good.. It fits my iOmega eGo 500GB portable HDD quite well.. Very good design..Highly Recommended..
4,good product,"its a good product. I am using iti like its size, price and colorthe case protects the hard drive external right"
5,Great Compact Case,Great little hard case for my Seagate portable external drive. Love the color. It's lightweight and compact and it has a band to keep the drive in place and a mesh pocket on the other side for cables or other small items.
3,"Like the case, doesn't fit.","This case is shown as a companion to the La Cie Rugged. This case is too small for that hard drive. I found this case in a slightly larger size and it works great. The problem here is not the case, but Amazon showing it with the La Cie Rugged."
1,Size,"I purchased this because it was listed as an item frequently purchased with the Seagate Expansion External Hard Drive. The case was too small to hold the drive. I had to return it with a little bit of hassle, but finally got my money returned after I paid for postage. The case wasn't too bad, just too small. It is a good idea to check before you buy. After going through this, I went back to the page to check to see if this pairing had been corrected and it is still there."
3,"Okay, like the size but not the SMELL...","I bought this to protect my Wi Drive when traveling. The case will function well for that. However, the terrible SMELL associated with the material was not good. I am not sure if I should try febreeze or leaving it out in the sun, or what, but I was astounded at how bad it smelled. Also, the fuzzy inner lining had some crumbly debris stuck to it on the side with the little pouch. I managed to scrape all of it out, but in conjunction with the bad smell, it put me off a little bit. I believe the case will work for what it was intended for, and I have extra room for cables and even a headphone amplifier, but I was less than happy with the purchase."
4,"Good value, nice case, fits my Garmin GPS","I bought this to use as a case for my Garmin GPS and it works fine. Well made and strong enough to provide decent protection. I have another one purchased earlier that I used for a portable hard-drive. The quality of these cases is good and they hold up well. Case Logic makes a few different sizes, all very similar, and all seem good."
2,Disappointing.,"I thought that this case was going to be a perfect fit for my 500GB WD Passport Essential, but I was wrong. I trusted Amazon with this recommendation, but I'm very disappointed. It does have a hard exterior as seen, but the interior is not very cushioned. It has no foam or multiple layers, or anything to cushion the WD Passport Essential. I feel that if my WD fell (while in the case) it would not be protected. If there was some cushion inside, then possibly it would be far more protected and safe. It feels like a waste of $18 for this reason, and because my WD does not fit exactly and can slide around quite easily. I'm just disappointed in Amazon over all, for recommending something so ...cheap?"
3,A Little Smaller Than Previous Case Logic Cases,"I own several other Case Logic cases for external hard drives, so I ordered several more of these from Amazon. I was disappointed to find that these are actually about an inch shorter than those I had used before. The external hard drive does fit in these, but I had previously put the external hard drive into the soft cases they came with, then put the soft case into the Case Logic case (for extra protection.) This is no longer possible with these shorter cases."
5,Portable Case[logic] Case,"Nice, tight, secure...does the job. I purchased one more for another portable hard drive I bought."
5,Hard drive case,This is an excellent case for my hard drive - protective and compact. Will prevent me from misplacing or damaging the drive.
1,was not what I thought it would be.,Amazon recommended this case when I ordered my WD book external HD. But it is meant for a small personal HD. So thank to Amazon Case Logic gets a bad report.
2,Poor case,"the case is poor,,,it does not actually protects your HD 90%and the price is not worth for this productthanks"
1,did not read correctly,This case is much too big for the unit-but my fault obviously did not check the dems-so now it sits in a drawer
1,Wrong item,The item sent is about half the size it needs to be to hold the item it was bought to hold.
4,"Excellent quality, a tad too big","This is a very sturdy case, although it certainly is larger than my WD Passport drive."
4,fits perfectly,This is a nice fitting case for my portable HD. It looks so nice and compact and what a neat color.
4,The Logic PHDC-1 Portable Hard Drive Case (Magenta),The Logic PHDC-1 Portable Hard Drive Case was a life saver and a very good protective measure for my portable HD...I love my HD carrying case.James
5,Portable hard drive case,"Good case. I bought it to carry the red Toshiba Portable Hard Drive and the color doesn't quite match. That really doesn't matter but in case anyone else was looking for that, now you know. It was on sale so was an excellent buy for the money. It is made well."
4,Hard drive case,A bit oversized for the application I bought it for- the Toshiba 320GB hard drive but otherwise good.
4,Sturdy & well constructed,The case logic portable hard drive case is sturdy & well constructed. I am very pleased with it. I use it everyday to transport my Toshiba USB portable hard drive from home to work to where-ever. It does what I need it to do.
4,Worth the money!!!,"I recently order this case for my Seagate Goflex 1.5 TB external hard drive. Drive and connector fits really well and it looks great too. Only thing that I felt could have been better is, it should have more padding for safety. But overall it worth the money."
3,"Good case, but didn't fit my Iomega drive","I like this case, but it's just a little too small for myIomega eGo Mac Edition 500 GB USB 2.0/FireWire 400/800 Portable External Hard Drive 34629 (Ruby Red)to fit comfortably. Was able to squeeze it in there, but it barely zips shut."
4,"Good quality, worth the price","This case fits aSeagate FreeAgent GoFlex 1 TBperfectly, along with one of the detachable cables. I was hoping it had room for both the USB cable and the FW800 cable, but it's just a little too small for that. So if you're looking for a good way to protect and carry around your GoFlex and one cable, this is the go-to for you."
5,Common Sense Protection,"I have purchased one of these cases with each of my four Go-Flex drives because they provide plenty of fitted storage space for the drive AND the associated cables. They keep the dust off when not in use and protect the drive when in transport between the house and the RV (which can be subject to a lot of bouncing around). My wife uses hers because she litteraly thows her 500 gig into her briefcase as she rushes out to work. The case is starting to show a little wear from her hasty departures but the drive itself shows not a scratch and operates perfectly. It is worth its small purchase price just in peace of mind.Rest assured, that every time I buy a new drive, one of these cases will be on that purchase order without fail."
1,does not fit,"Looking at Amazon's bundling advice I ordered this case along with Seagate 1 TB external hard drive. Trusting in Amazon I threw away the receipt and the package to the thrash and came to use this case with my drive. However, I realized that the hard drive does not fit in this case. Can't understand how Amazon bundles a case which is not big enough for the external drive!!! great disappointment.."
5,Perfect for the WD Hard drive,"Hard sided case, perfect for the WD Hard drive, has a nice spot for the cable to store securely."
2,this ain't for the WD Passport 250Gb,"good product, has a solid feel yet lightweight. excellent storage for electronic stuff. another quality product from case logic, for 15bucks you cant go wrong with this. only problem is, that its NOT made for the Western Digital 250 (wish I read the others reviews first) its too loose probably, 0.5 to an inch vertical gap. just think of the two like shooting a volleyball to a basketball ring."
4,Not for WD Passport Drive Black,"This Case is too big for WD Passport Black, however is well made, good quality, nice for others Drive bit bigger, be aware case like this are selling on Ebay, they have WD original case but is too big for WD HD Passport black, those on sale on EBAY were made for WD Silver which is more large, and older external drive. The Original only WD web site have it :Exterior dimensions: 5.6"" x 4.6"" x 1.1"" Interior dimensions: 5.3"" x 4.3"" x 0.8""They sale as well a nice Punch bag at $5.00 + S&H.; if you bought the largecase like this on amazon, you can use the pounch WD to Fit in your drive.http://www.westerndigital.com/en/products/Products.asp?DriveID=261"
2,WAY too big for my WD Passport 250GB,"This product is way too big for modern external 2.5"" drives. My drive (WD Passport 250GB) measures roughly 5.0"" x 3.0"" x 0.6"". Meanwhile, the external dimensions of this case are 6.75"" x 4.75"" x 1.75"". It's ridiculously big.Even with the elastic straps, my hard drive is loose inside the case. I can actually fit two of my drives in a pinch.Not what I was looking for"
4,Great case but not universal for all portable hard drives!,"This case is great for the Seagate Freeagent Go which is a ""compact"" portable hard drive. I have both a Freeagent Go and another portable hard drive but evidently my other portable hard drive is slightly bigger and does not fit in this ""compact"" case. I just want to make sure people buy the right case for the size of their portable hard drive."
5,The best to protect your portable hard drive,it is a case light enough to protect any portable hard drive with the appropiate dimensions. It has an internal pocket that you can use to put other stuff such as documents or cables.
3,Nice but not really roomy,"I like it, and it's good for protecting my hard drive but i wish it had more room for cords and what not."
5,Cool Case,i bought this for my 160gb Western Digital Passport. The case feels solid and has a great protection feel to it. i wouldn't mind putting my precious little hard drive in this case and drop it (just in theory of course). The case has a little side pocket for your USB connector and the hard drive is nicely fit on the other side. I love the color black because it has a nice contrast with my red passport. I give it a 10/10.
3,Too large for Western Digital Passport,"I got this case because Amazon seemed to always join it with the WD Passports. Nice little case, but much too large for the Western Digital Passport. I suggest the actual case that Western Digital sells. That one is perfect."
4,Very simple and useful,When I saw it for the first time it didn't make an impression but is very useful.
4,Case Logic case for WD Passport HD,"good for what its used for...When I bought this, WD wasn't making cases for these passport hard drives...they do now and may be better than these aftermkt ones, but this is adequate and will do the job quite well...its just generic...not bad"
2,Hardly a hard case,"I ordered this case expecting a 'durable, hardshell exterior', as stated in the description. The case is extremely floppy and the sides can be easily punched in and turned entirely inside out. There is no padding that I could see. The case would provide a hard drive as much protection as a thick plastic bag.I will be returning the case and won't be shopping this brand's 'hard case' line again."
1,Case,"The web site recommends this case for this product. It is a great case, but not for this product as the size is too small. Please confirm before just buying a recommended product without checking size."
4,Very good case,"Very good case to protect my recently acquired WD Passport 160Gb drive. It has space for the drive and for the cable, as shown in the photo. I could just be a little smaller to be perfect for the WD Passport."
4,Misquoted dimension,"Amazon misquoted the dimensions of the item. I purchased making calculations so that my hard drive (Seagate Expansion 750gb) would fit. When I got the item, the packaging itself had different and lesser dimensions. Returned and got refunded. Seemed quality item, but misrepresentation defeats the purpose"
5,Protects and serves,Keeps you drive safer (it's not water proof) and has room for cables and other stuff.
5,Awesome Case -- the haters are commenting on the wrong thing,"I love this case. i have 3 of them. 1 for each drive. the drive i use is the LACIE RUGGED 500 gb. This case protects the drive well and has a nice little inside pouch for the cable of choiceAll the people complaining (illegitimately) about this case, are in fact complaining (legitimately) about Amazon having coupled this case with the wrong drives. This is annoying, but it is Amazon's fault. not the fault of Case Logic who makes the case.so if this case will, in fact fit your drive, then buy it. it's a GREAT CASE! however, check the dimensions to make sure. no reason to be unnecessarily annoyed."
2,too bulky,"These are definitely protective, but are larger than I expected. Too bulky, which sort of defeats the purpose of carrying around a small portable drive."
5,More Than Expected,"I simply thought it was going to be a loose case, but i love how there is an elastic band that holds my portable hard drive in place. I also like how it provides a mesh compartment where I can store the USB cable."
5,A Perfect Fit,"Length:: 1:39 MinsBottom line, it serves its purpose of protecting your hard drive. If you own a portable hard drive having a case is highly recommended."
3,Case is too compact!,"The case just big enough to hold the LaCie portable drive. I think it would be better if there was space to also store the cables along with the drive, then everything would stay together."
2,great case but the hard drive doesn't fit it!,"I bought this case because it was ""advertised"" along with the external hard drive I bought (Verbatim Insight 500 GB 2 USB), but alas, the hard drive is too big for the case. It's a really nice case--for a smaller hard drive."
3,Too Big for Seagate FreeAgent Go,"The case is nice enough, for a drive which might actually fit in it. But way too big for my Seagate FreeAgent Go 500. The elastic strap doesn't even stretch when the drive is in place, and the drive is free to slide around and bounce against the edges. Which probably is worse for the drive then just throwing it in the average bag.I do use it, but I cut a padded envelope in half and wrap the drive in it first, then the drive is truly protected. It's a hassle though, and I'd really like to find a case which actually protected the drive properly and still was easy to take in and out.Note that this case is not actually padded. It has a semi-rigid shell, which along with some actual padding around the drive would be great. But you'll have to supply your own cushioning (assuming your drive is small enough, like the FreeAgent Go)."
5,Good little protector!,External hard drives can be so delicate and it's important to my peace of mind to spend a little bit more to protect it even if it spends its entire life in a desk drawer and rarely travels (we'll see!). This case is good durable quality which is not too soft at all and I trust it with my data. The magenta is a chill color...something to be said for adding a dash of personality to a pretty standard thing. Fits the Toshiba 320GB HDDR320E04XW nicely with no complaints. All my drive needs is one little USB cord so it fits snug in case's mesh pocket. Happy stuff.
5,Just the perfect case for a Seagate Go Portable 1TB Hard Drive,"This is my second Case-Logic case for a portable hard drive, (original case is 1-1/2 years old and shows no wear). This PHDC-1 case fits the Seagate 1TB Go Portable drive like a glove. The sizes are misleading on the various sites. The PHDC-1 inside dims are: 3.5 wide X 5.25 long X 1.5 thick. Like another reviewed stated, it's a bit snug on the width, but no worries."
2,It's okay.,"I does protect my Western Digital external hard drive, but it's a little bit too big. Plus, the color that they advertise in the image online is deceiving. It is a much darker color in real life and the color was the reason that I purchased it."
4,Not so good for HDD like Seagate GoFlex Series,"I bought this case for my Seagate GoFlex 1TB external HDD - I can put HDD in it but is tight unless I remove GoFlex adaptor. However it will provide very good protection for your HDD especially edges of it and storage inner pocket for cable. This one is perfect for WD HDDs or Seagate GoFlex Slim HDDs. Size of this case is very compact, zipper working without any problem.One of better Case Logic cases and price is very attractive.I removed one star only because as I said before it was recommended for Seagate GoFlex 1TB or 1,5TB HDDs and it is very tight for those HDDs. If you have GoFlex HDD then you should consider to buy ""Drive Logic DL-64 Portable EVA Hard Drive Carrying Case Pouch"" - I bought this for GoFlex 1,5Tb and it has more space for HDD of this size plus pocket for cable and extra GoFlex adaptor (for example eSATA or FireWire 800)."
2,Does not hold all accessories.,"The sea gate satellite comes with more accessories than this holds. I will have to find something else to create a travel ""kit"" for the iPad, satellite,and all the ""stuff"""
2,Too Tight,"The case is too small. By the time I put the cables and drive into it, I can barely zip it up."
5,JUST WHAT ITS SAYS,This case arrived in time and was just as was advertised. great product just waiting to see how long it will last.
2,DOES NOT FIT TO THE SILICON POWER ARMOR A80 - BUT IT IS A GOOD CASE FOR ALL THE REST,THE REASON FOR 2 STARSDOES NOT FIT TO THE SILICON POWER ARMOR A80 - BUT IT IS A GOOD CASE FOR ALL THE RESTand it is a very nice CaseThank You
1,Ho-hum,"As film noir goes, this was a bummer. Having been spoiled by excellent film noirs like ""Niagra,"" ""Out Of The Past,"" ""Criss Cross,"" and the 1946 version of ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" I supposed I am hard to please. To please me, noirs have to measure up to the high standards set by those."
1,Somebody has to say that this is not a film noir.,"I bought it following its excellent reviews, but I am of the opinion that it is a very foreseeable gangster film of the kind made by the propaganda industry of those years."
4,New York Confidential,"Good old fashioned gangster movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, would recommend it to others who enjoy gangster movies of yesteryear."
4,Answering the question about NYC's screen ratio,"This adddresses comments about the image being cropped off at the top of the DVDs:On the original 35mm fine grain (the master film element made directly off the camera negative)there is no question that the image looks a bit cropped on the bottom with, conversely, too much headroom on top. To further complicate matters, the logo/main title/credits are perfectly framed. The film was examined by experts, and the technician who transferred the film to digital made sure the entire bottom of the image, as it appeared on the fine grain, was shown on the DVD.The original 1955 35mm release print shown at the Palm Springs Film Noir Festival looked exactly the same.So far no one has an explanation as to why!"
2,"Too many ""live"" versions on this cd","As the title suggests, there are too many ""live"" versions on this cd. Live versions of songs are most always inferior to their studio versions. There's just way too many live versions on this album. The live version of ""Amazing Grace"" is a debacle as the audience is requested to ""sing along"". *Who* wants to hear that? Not me? About half of this cd is a waste. NOT a good compilation."
5,"JOAN EPITOMIZES PEACE,LOVE,SPIRIT,SOUL =LOVE FROM WYOMING;-)","I HAD LOTSA JOAN ALBUMS AND WITH SO MANY AIR FORCE MOVES DURING MY CAREER I EVENTUALLY LET THE VINYLS GO. THE CD REMINDED ME OF THE CONCERT I SAW HER AT FOLSOM FIELD ALONG WITH SOME UNKNOWN GUY (BOB DYLAN) HA! YES WE INHALED (LIKE BILL AND GEORGE W.,) WORE PACHOOLI OIL, LOVE BEADS AND SOME HAD A RAINBOW DAY (IT WAS SUN AND RAIN). I MISS MY AIR FORCE BUDDIES AND WHERE ARE THEY NOW;-(---YES I WAS ANTI VNAM WAR, BUT I WANTED TO TRY AND CHANGE THE SYSTEM LIKE ""THEY TOLD US TO DO"".

THESE MEMORIES ARE INTERMINGLED WITH JOAN BAEZ WHO HAS ADDED SO MUCH TO MY HEART AND SOUL---THESE MANY YEARS LATER:-)"
5,Joan's always Joan..,What can I say..Joan's music is always on my mind..everyday..This album is one of the best compilation of Joan's works..To bad that Joan don't work too much with new albums for the happyness of her fans..
2,ok,"This album isn't great, and she always sounds the same through different songs. I do like the song she made a tribute to Janis though."
2,Digital Horrors,"I thought I was doing the right thing by getting the ""remastered"" version. The recording seems to encompass everything bad about digital recording. Harsh over prossessed, Joan's voice robbed of emotion and feeling. No I'm not an anolog only guy, 97% of all my music is on CD but I think I will try to find Diamonds and Rust on LP."
3,The missing song,"Overall, this collection is not bad. ""Diamonds and Rust"" is an excellent song, but those that follow aren't consistently the best versions available. Other reviewers have done better than I could at specifying what's not so great, and why.One very large question remains: Since this album includes the loving and well-intentioned, but musically mediocre song about Baez's son Gabriel (""Children And All That Jazz""), where on earth is her absolutely beautiful and haunting ballad to Gabriel's father, David Harris?""A Song For David,"" which is not only intensely personal but also captures a taste of the politics of the time, should be an essential track on any recording that claims to include the very best from Baez's post-early-years works."
2,Look elsewhere for these songs,"I was very disappointed with this CD. Firstly the remaster is not digital. The sound is flat. Then some of the cuts are from concerts. Amazing Grace, one of her most beautiful songs, is done with audience participation. To make matters worse, she rapidly speaks the words to each verse before singing it to that the audience can participate. This breaks the mood of the song.I really feel that I wasted my money."
1,Disappointing....,"This was very disappointing. ""Amazing Grace"" was a sing-a-long. Just awful. I don't want to hear sing-a-long over and over on a recording!!! I'd get ""Diamonds and Rust"" if I could do it over again."
1,Bought it by mistake,Bought it based on the track listing; should have listened to the samples first; very disappointed in the inferior live recordings.
2,Disappointed,"I have long loved Joan Baez's voice and the music she contributed to the '60s and '70s. However, this CD was a major disappointment to me. I expected a Greatest Hits CD to be complete and include high quality recordings. This CD offered neither."
3,joan baez greatest hits,"I bought this CD for Diamonds and Rust, and as it turns out, it's the best song on the CD."
4,Works well for its price,"Bought this to make my own cables and after one week I have already made 6 cat5 e cables. And they work fine. This tool could be better, but then again the price could also be much higher. This is a good deal for the money."
3,Better than expectations,Cute This movie was good for a quiet Friday with my little dancer. Thought there would be more dancing in it though.
3,OKAY,"This movie was not what I expected, but was still a cute show. The way the family was formed was a curiosity. there wasn't a real strong feeling about the Movie. I should have rented it instead of buying it."
5,A good story for young girls,"I bought it for my daughter who had read the book. She enjoyed it and it is one of her favorite. I use to buy movies based on books my family has read, specially my daughter. She considers that the movie, in general, is close to the book."
3,It's okay,"Love the book. The movie is a bit weak, but sweet. Worth a watch if you're a fan of the book and Emma Watson."
4,Loved it! Great movie for pre teen and up!,"Lovely story of three adopted girls who struggle to make thier way in the world. It was beautifully done and shows another acting fascet of Emma Watson, who can really act, not just in Harry Potter."
3,wha?,"This was kind of weird. I didn't hate it, I just...didn't get it? The story was odd and unbelievable, the character motivations were strange and also unbelievable, and the overall finish didn't feel very triumphant or super satisfying, it felt rushed.I am an adult, though, and this does seem to be more of a kid movie, so do keep that in mind."
4,Sweet movie,"I didn't realize that I had seen this movie once before but enjoyed watching it once again. A sweet, light hearted movie."
4,"um, okay but not brilliant","It was a nice story, just a little slow to make its point. The girls were great actresses, and Emma Watson proved she can act as something besides Hermoine Granger, kudos for her. The redhead was also very good... especially in the scene when she's crying because her teacher died and won't be able to teach her anymore. The brunette was also superb... her character was my favorite. The only downside was the ""father""... his character was hardly convincing. I mean... who disappears for 12 years and suddenly return just in time? Maybe I had to read the book to understand it. Either way, great movie."
2,Dissapointed,"I was dissapointed in this movie. There is not anything terribly inappropriate, although several comments are made about the girls' bust sizes and one of the characters wears low cut blouses. There wasn't much of a plot somehow and many dead ends. The youngest girl, Posey, turns into a brat and winds up getting her way in the end. There isn't much ballet in it at all and the title itself has nothing to do with the movie. If you're a ballet fan, you will only be dissapointed. It's really not a children's movie.The movie did keep my interest and the cast and acting is brilliant, but. . . . . Watch it if you want."
3,Just admit it! You like it!,"No blood, no smoking tires, no serial killers! And yet no boredom and falling asleep!Invite Your grand daughter and enjoy it! Sweet girls in a lovely story!Everything is fine in this little movie."
3,Charming,"A charming and appealing film with a theatrical feel. I think lots of tweens will relate to the three girls who have dreams that they strive for and have to learn how to achieve them when messy life gets in the way. This movie reminds me of the American Girl stories. I'm impressed with the young actress Yasmin Paige as Petrova; she shows remarkable talent. I found myself bored even though the pacing moved at a remarkable speed. Basically, I was entertained for an hour and twenty minutes but it's a forgettable film."
4,Ballet Shoes Review,"Usually I don't like this type of movie but this was enchanting and had my attention for most of the movie. I didn't think of Emma Watson as her Harry Potter Character at all when I saw her in this movie (even though there is another Harry Potter actor in it). I give this movie 4 stars for one big reason and that is I normally don't like ""chick flicks"" but this one I had to see all the way through."
3,the sorta ultimate patti labelle,"this cd could have been indeed been the definitive collection but anyone who is a fan of miss patti knows her signature song is You Are My Friend, it's not included here on this cd. the sound of what is on the cd is great, but alas like i said it's lacking the big gun"
2,missing too many songs,"No ""You Are My Friend"", no ""If Only You Knew"", no ""Love, Need and Want You""- definitely NOT definitive!!"
5,works with minolta 5D,"I own a Minolta 5D camera with a Tamron 28-300mm lens and developed a need for a flash. I heard this flash would work so I tried it. it works flawlessly, I can adjust the angle to bounce light off ceilings for perfect pictures. The unit has good flash distance for the zoom lens and does work wirelessly or remotely. I am still playing with the bouncing of light off walls as this flash head swivels both left and right."
2,I must of Got A Lemon,"I've had this flash for well over two years now and I for the life of me can't see what everyone's raving about. Light falloff is a big problem, and underexposure seems to be the norm. About the only way I seem to be able to get around this is to manually compensate on the order of 2 stops to get anything resembling decent lighting. The pop-up on my A100 is much better generally. I've contacted Sony to see if there's possibly a problem with the camera but as of yet they haven't answered me. I was much happier when I was able to use my Vivitar 283/85's. Then again, maybe I'm just an old crab."
5,Sony HVL-F56AM Flash,Great flash - everything it claims and more. I won't bore you with technical details - they are available elsewhere. I was skeptical about spending 3 Benjamins on a flash but it is the best flash for my Sony DSLR that I have found. Just buy it!
2,Got it cheap... and serves me right.,"Got it for $15 after rebate from CompUSA. If it wasn't for that rebate I will think twice about buying this. I used to have a Belkin router that never failed my connection for the two years I've had it. This ZyXel router is a pain. It drops my connection at least twice a week and I have to restart it and restart my modem everytime it drops. Worse thing is, my Vonage phone line is also connected with it, so when it drops, my phone is dead too."
2,Poor Quality Very Poor Customer Service,"ZyXel does not care enough to have a 24 hour customer service number, and they need it. Just read the reviews, the lower ones are true to my experence, drops connections all day long and takes over 2 mins to get back . NO WAY I RECOMEND this router, again trying to save a few bucks cost me way to much. JUNK.."
2,Limits your bandwidth to under 2.0mbps,I have been paying for 20mbps cable but this router limited me to about 1.5mbps. I've complained with my ISP about slow internet but they said everything looks good on their equipment as well as my Surfboard modem(s). After replacing my DOCSIS 2.0 Motorola surfboard to a 3.0 I clocked about 3.0mbps. Soon I realized hardwiring got me ups to 20 mbps and knew it was my Zyxel wifi router that was slow. I later replaced that with a Dual band Gigabit wifi router for $70 and am now clocking about 16mbps. Don't limit your self to the minimum. This Zyxel P330W is probably only good if you're paying for 1.5mpbs DSL. Otherwise it's a bare basic router with easy set up but limited range even in my small house.
5,Reliable Router,"The router arrived quickly and was installed in a matter of minutes. It has worked wonderfully well, allowing for rapid downloads to the PC while successfully connecting the laptop to the internet. No problems with any aspect of this product. I heartily recommend this for use."
4,A great family resource,"Are there more bike shops per capita in Rochester or is it just that so many people want to enjoy the outdoors from May through October? I can't think of a more enjoyable source of weekend r&r than taking one of the trails suggested in this book. There are good suggestions for ability, the maps are adequate, and the directions to the start of the trail are clear. The only thing I'd add to this book is an online link for printable maps so I don't have to take the book (although pocketable) along. A must for any Rochesterian who wants to enjoy the trails around town."
5,Attn. students and conference organizers,"This is the second ripflash in our family and the first ripflash plus. The plus has everything that I found missing in the original ripflash. The built-in microphone has near recording studio quality and transfering files is easy. I installed the software on two different Win XP computers without a hitch, first time around. If you are listening to a long lecture and turn off the player, it can go back to where you left off. I get about nine hours of recording per 128M, and it uses rechargeable batteries very well. Having mp3 files ready right after a lecture is great for distributing it on CDs or over the Web. It is small and light. Customer support has been good. I use it almost every day and really haven't had any headaches."
2,Dirty but Decent,"Not exactly intuitive. User interface is pretty horrible. Takes some reading to understand all functions. Although the analog to digital conversion is impressive, it's difficult to use as a recording device. The mic on the thing is absolutely horrid, but when hooked up to self powered condenser it sounds darn good. I was disappointed that you can't see or control the level of the input for recording. One other down side is that it's not the most stable piece of equipment. I use it daily and about twice a week the thing freezes up on me and I have to resort to a hard restart (taking out the batterys for a min). Although their is a lot to be desired this is the only product on the market at it's price that gets the job done."
4,Average product...,the voice quality is not very good. But it's an useful product. Intially installing the drive was a pain. Now with new drivers the installation was easy...will recommend this product if it's less than 100...
5,Coolest MP3 Player,Good Voice recording thingycool designLots of MemoryUpgradeableLight weightEasy to install
1,Do not buy this! ! !,"This digital recorder worked good for one month. Then, it progressively became more and more unreliable. Now two months after purchase and it is completely useless. Plus the software never worked from the beginning. So, there was no way to use it with my computer even though it supposedly worked with my computer software."
1,Buyer Beware -- Frustrating device,"This is a highly frustrating device, and I'm not sure that I won't be giving up and returning it soon. The drivers seem to conflict with itself and randomly try to reinstall themselves when you plug into your PC. Buttons don't seem to work. There is no customer service number to call.But, I have to give some credit -- I did get an email response within a half hour. Cryptic, but a response nonetheless."
4,Great Product: difficult installation,"Purchased this product for use during exercise and it is wonderful in that respect. I have 29 songs downloaded and the quality is excellent, random feature is great for the gym. Only downside is the installation of the software, my one piece of advice is: DO NOT USE THE CD SOFTWARE THAT COMES WITH THE PRODUCT, DOWNLOAD DIRECTLY FROM THE WEBSITE. Also, I disgarded the headphones that came with the product and purchased a great pair of Sony earbuds that wrap around your ear."
2,Returned a faulty unit,"I had one for about a month and used it extensively. The recording quality was okay for a musical sketchbook, but my unit would lock up after about 2 and a half minutes of recording time, I'd have to take out the battery, and the recording would be garbage. I decided to return it and wait for some units with more features (recording level control mainly).Playback was nice though - and I found the software reasonably easy to use and install on XP. I didn't see any driver problems.The unit itself is small and convient to use and carry. It seemed pretty well-built for the price.It is what it is, a full-ish featured, low-end mp3 recorder."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!,"I received this product as a Christmas gift. Less than 6 months later, the case began to crumble. The device was never dropped or abused in any way - quite frankly it was only used 2 or 3 times to record attached via line in to a sound board. I had been really impressed with the product until having to deal with Pogo Tech support regarding replacing the item. I was basically told I was a liar and the damage would only occur if the device was abused. I was talked down to, demeaned and they refused to budge on a $15 repair charge. I do not recommend purchasing a product from Pogo unless you consider it a disposable product, not an investment."
1,Disappointment,"The features on this product are very intriguing. Imagine my disappointment when the software provided with the program would not install. WinXP would not recognize the cd-rom. To make matters worse, the documentation was very poorly written and gave almost no guidance as to problem solving. Of course, there was no technical support. In fact, the only way to contact the manufacturer was by snail mail."
3,imo,"I bought the cd for the songs ""strawberry letter23"" and ""stomp"" all around good dance cd. Though I bought it to add to my library of the music of my childhood. I was suprised to like ""get the funk outta ma face"""
4,Purple with a Purpose,I like Purple with a Purpose; I alternate it with a more plum shade...I love purple! It stayed on for one month! No chips!
4,Funny but Terribly Unoriginal,"If I were to judge this series based purely on how much I enjoyed this opening volume, it would be receiving incredibly high marks. From start to finish I really found myself laughing at this series. The characters are very nicely drawn, the pacing is well done and the jokes are over the top but still very funny.While terribly funny and entertaining, it's just not original enough to get high marks. If you're willing to look past that though, what you're going to find is a highly entertaining series that will absolutely have you rolling."
2,Clearly biased...,"I give two stars to this book decause of its good coverage of early norse/celtic/british exploration of the Northern Atlantic.However the deliberate omission of important contributions by other people namely the Basque and the Portuguese in medieval times is difficult to understand. It's enough to look at a map to find a lot of non-norse/non-english/non-native names (as a small example the words ""Labrador"",""Boa Ventura"",""Canada"",""Porto Novo"" are Portuguese!).If the title of this book was: ""Early Norse and British exploration of the North Atlantic"" I would give 5 stars."
5,Invaluable reference,"My being in the music business, this work is a natural and useful reference for me. I can also see, however, how many professionals across a number of occupations would want to keep this book within close reach, particularly those in advertising or any number of creative fields. This book is truly an impressive, vast resource."
4,good ride,Nice and smooth until I hit washboards then they seem too stiff and really vibrate the car. They take frost heaves easily.
4,Experince with lightscribe.,"It's a great DVD recorder, but I've been trouble with the Lightscribe feature. Thus far, only two disc, out of a dozen, has been succesfully burned with the Lightscribe process. I hope is a matter of software. I'll keep trying."
4,One Issue,"I have only been using the drive for a couple of days and havent had any issues with its burning abilities. The issue I had was with the bundled ""NERO"" software. I wish LITE-ON would use someone else! All I needed was a program for the LIGHTSCRIBE and NERO gives you every program ever wirtten. Plus when I tried to scribe images to my DVD's using NERO only the text printed not the image. I wasted 3 DVD's. After updating the software I ended up loosing the whole program when NERO tried to install the upgrade. I now downloaded ""SureThing"" and it works great."
1,Do not Buy!,"As the title says - DO NOT BUY this DVD drive. Never in the month I've used it did the speeds come close to the ratings. Also, numerous times the drive would lock up and the only way to retrieve the disk was to use the manual eject. Save your money!"
5,One of Lifes Great Investments ...,"I strongly recommend you invest in this book. The tools you need to grow yourself a life you will love are presented in an easy to understand way, with reference to growing, planting seeds and using nurturing love as our life's gardening tools. You can feel Barbara's energy, fun and enthusiasm for life bounding from the copy to inspire new passion in your life.

With the help of Barbara Garro MA and her wonderful zest for life bubbling from the pages of this book, I feel once again in charge of my mission...Look forward to your comments..."
5,A Great Book for expanding your potential!,"With insight and humor, Barbara Garro shares priceless gems of wisdom about life skills we all need to thrive in the midst of the ordinary hassles we encounter. This unique collection of stories, anecdotes, and practical exercises provides a variety of ways to activate your inner wisdom, respond to life's challenges and help you make a difference in our world. This book will appeal to people in every age group. A definite must-read for readers interested in a fuller, happier life!"
5,Calling all guys with broken hearts!,"If you are a man who's heart has ever been broken by a woman, I recomend you get this single. The line ""Learned my lesson and So did she"" explains my love life to a T, and I'm sure it does to many of you out there as well."
1,"Please, PLEASE do not compare them with Nirvana","I'm not a die-hard Nirvana fan, but I know that they would not write disposable, dumb tripe like this. I've heard constant comparisons of Puddle Of Mudd to Nirvana, how their lead singer sounds like Kurt, how they're ""grunge,"" etc. Whatever. Pass on this. Too annoying to even be a guilty pleasure. Don't bother."
3,Can easily be skipped,"I have always loved Rachael Lampa and looked forward with eager expectation for this album. After blindly buying ""Blur"" which was just a bunch of remixes from her two previous albums, I was hoping for better from this album. I have always seen Rachael as a ""Christian diva."" But this album is disappointing. Where her previous albums seemed more personal, popular, and tender, this is a much more rocky, harder Rachael. The songs seem much less focused on Jesus. Could it be that she wants to cross over into pop music, like Amy Grant did before her? I do not know. I always loved Rachael, for she was an inspiring Catholic Christian artist. This self-titled album, however, is a disappointment. If you would like to listen to it, get the 7-day free trial of Real Player's Rhapsody service and you can listen to it all you want. Then you decide if it is worth the investment."
4,Nicely Done,She's one of my favorite Christian singers and what a voice she has! More polished and refined than her earlier efforts it's got a handful of standout tracks that are just awesome.
5,Excellent!,"I bought this album even after reading some negative reviews on this site. Those negative reviews impacted my opinions of the album for a while. However, over time, I came to my own personal conclusion that I LOVE THIS ALBUM! It took some getting used to for me because it's so different than her first (which is the only other one I have of hers), but I have come to like every song on the album. Favorites are Rubber House and When I Fall (as well as others).I have been planning to write a positive review here for months to refute the negative ones and now I'm finally doing it. I was so glad to find that there are many other positive reviews now.Way to go Rachel!"
4,Joan Baez - Greatest Hits,"The music is good and I enjoy it, Joan Baez does a beautiful job - as usual! I will buy more Joan Baez CD's."
5,Gortex Watch Cap,The watch cap is a really warm item for those cold days. Would recommend this to others and recommend the store of Andrew Christian as well.
5,Wish I could get the entire set on Amazon!,"Since I've been a mystery lover from my childhood Nancy Drew days, I'm always anxious to see more mystery movies...I love Mystery Women because Samantha, Cassie and Philby seem like people I'd like to know in real life! The interior scenes at the bookstore intrigue me, as I love old, antiquey rooms with lots of area rugs and old book shelves....I do wish there was more character development in others who live in the town and visit the bookstore, though.....the lack of this does make the series a bit one dimensional....but I wish Amazon would have more of the DVD's available....I watched a few more of the series on the Hallmark channel last weekend, and checked this morning to see if there were more of the series offered, but there are still only the three that I've already ordered....maybe soon!"
3,movie,I have no idea how to review this movie. This is an item that I have never ordered. There a re a couple of others on my list that I did not order.
1,Worked fine for while,"My RipFlash Pro worked well for a while. It is very small, lightweight, and sounds great, but now the unit freezes up my system when I connect it. I reinstalled the software many times and no luck. Also, the recording quality is very bad as it has no compressor (minimizes and compresses loud sounds so that it won't distort). I'll stick with MiniDisk for recording and will look for another MP3 player."
1,"Would be great, if it worked","Received Ripflash pro as a gift. Thought it was great until I tried to install it on my computer. I could not get passed the second step in the installation as I kept getting error messages no matter how many times I tried. The directions were useless, as my two year old speaks with more clarity than who ever wrote them. I am having very little success with customer support and will likely be sending this inferior, overpriced piece of garbage back to the out of touch tech geeks who made it. Save yourself the trouble, buy a walkman."
2,Low end but faithful,"It works well, battery life is kind of low though. There are so many more out there today that do much better go get one of those."
5,More people should be reading this collection of poetry,"I read this collection of poems for a class and I really wish more people were reading it. It is a collection of poetry about the murdered women of Ciudad Juárez on the border of the US and Mexico. The poems are beautiful and haunting, filled with the pain of such a huge tragedy. The poems are in English and Spanish, making the potential audience for these poems huge. I hope more people read them in the future!"
1,wrong description,"careful, this cable may work ""for most digital cameras,"" but it does not work with canon digital cameras"
1,Incorrect Description,Cable does not fit HP315 even though description says it does. The only reason I'm not returning it is because shipping would cost me more than I paid for the item.
1,does not fit cameras listed,This cable does NOT fit kodak as listed. I know have useless cable and still can't connect via usb to pc.
1,NOT compatible with all Kodak EasyShare Docks!,"I bought this cord because the product description labeled it as compatible with Kodak EasyShare Docks. Received the product, and what do you know, not compatible to the dock. I have the 5.0 Megapixel DX 4530 EasyShare, and it is NOT compatible with this particular dock, regardless of what the description says!"
1,wrong part,"This cable did not fit my camera as stated. Because of the cost factor, I chose not to return it. The shipping was more than the cable was worth."
5,Shopping made easy!,"Inadvertantly my cable to my digital camera must have landed in the trash can. I panicked, but immediatley went to Amazon and found a cable to fit at a great price. I ordered and it came within a very timely fashion."
4,WHY IS EVERYONE COMPLAINING?,"To me, this is a reaaly good CD. I can hear a few different influences in here. Ghosts sort of reminds me of a David Bowie's Heroes...Sin Sin Sin kind of puts me in mind of the Smiths. All of these songs are catchy and he hasn't lost his sense of humor. I like this. If you can find it, buy it."
3,Average,"The first single TRIPPING is excellent - but dont expect any of that new sound to flow through to the rest of the album. Very average, very bland. Maybe you need to listen to it a couple of dozen times. Apparently Robbies cleaned up his act and is off the drugs these days - judging by this album he should get back on them!"
2,Not quite,"Robbie's not all here as he once was for his earlier work. If you're looking for good Robbie, check out Sing When You're Winning. On this disc, Robbie's just gone off on a tangent into some unfamiliar although creative sounds. No immetiate anthems here, so check out some of the older stuff."
2,Just one thing...,"O.K. Guy Chambers we've got the message, you were the genius in the Williams-Chambers writing duo... Please reconciliate with this guy and give us a good record!!!!"
2,I think robbie williams is SICK!,I think robbie williams is sick and I HATE his new album.I DO NOT like the songs. I think it is silly if the album is over 7!
1,The cellet silver 2.5mm has issues staying in your ear,"If I had to buy it again, I certainly would not, there is a lot of static from the connection and the ear piece will not stay in my ear, so in the middle of a staticy conversation, it will fall out."
4,The unkindest cuts of all,"Agreed, this is an excellent film version of Hamlet. It harkens back to the glory days of Russian cinema. The visuals are amazing. The ghost of Hamlet's father is worth the price of admission all by itself. The music, if overwrought at times, is mostly appropriate -- Shostakovich at his better.The film is so visual, however, that this is a detriment. The language is one of the main draws of Shakespeare -- and any translation is going to suffer, even if translated back via subtitles to Shakespeare.But the cuts. Knowing Hamlet well, it is difficult for me to judge, but I think that if the play is new to the viewer, the viewer will be missing quite a lot.Still, the sound and the fury signify much."
2,M ATX D101ggcl,"I am currently having interim system lockups for approximately 5 to 6 minutes. I'm starting to question it's compatibility with Windows Vista.I tried various workarounds assessing the bios. Even changing the OS selection to ""other"" therefore disabling Hyper Threading Technology.No resolve of yet. Also, I would prefer to have the Microsoft Natural Keyboard to function with that F 2 key routine."
1,its wrong and it sucks,"buyer beware!!! this is not the board you will recieve. it will fry after a power outage. It runs too hot for a typical board. when i contacted amazon about this they insured me that i had the right product (doesnt look anything like the picture) and i contacted the shipper about returns and possibly a warranty, but no, they hang up on me 2 times. DO NOT BUY THIS BOARD!! it should be pulled from the shelves. unless you like wasting money, i suggest an intel mother board, they are more reliable and they may cost 10-20 $'s more but they come with a 3 year warranty.I hope this influances you not to buy this crap. thank you"
1,How can this supplier convince me to buy this?,"I was going to buy this, but with one bad review, and no follow-up or assurance that this is an isolated situation I myself (or anyone else most likely) cannot trust any product now that comes from this distributor/store. I thought the company that put out and got the bad review might want to know why nobody is buying from them. I know I would. For me anyways, I base 99% of my purchasing descisions on customer feedback/reviews... so if they aren't good, I'm not buying.- aip"
1,POOR,I HAVE NOT RECIEVE THIS ORDER YET IT IS FROM THE 6 12 06 I AM STILL WAITING I HEVE ORDER THING FROM CHINA I RECIVE IT INLESS THAN 7 SAYS AND IT IS OVER A MONTH SINCE I HAVE ORDER THIS ITEM TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON
1,WAtch out barney and power rangers- here comes crap,"boring-dont read-similar to old man in the sea- there is no point to this short story- i am warning you- seeriously it wasnt bad, it just didnt have anny point- stupid basically-"
3,Average - but ok,I think my review is tainted simply because I was exposed to Roger Dawson's negotiationtactics first. They are written decidedly for sales people but I think the word for wordscripts will give people a much better grasp of these techniques more quickly and powerfully.Secrets of Power Negotiating for Salespeople: Inside Secrets from a Master NegotiatorStephen Reynolds[...]
2,Be Careful,"I have had Lyme disease for some time now, and am always interested in treatments that could help keep it at bay. I tried andrographis, the first of the core protocol herbs that this book suggests, and after three weeks of following the recommended dosage I broke out in hives all over my body. I have never had an allergic response to anything in my life, so I was quite surprised. Even after taking benadryl, my face and hands were severely swollen the following day. I saw three physicians to determine the nature of the allergic reaction, ended up on prednisone for 9 days, and I have since returned the remaining androgaphis bottles I had purchased. The author did indicate that very rarely people have an allergic reaction, and I suppose I was one of the unfortunates. I am sure the herb works wonders for some, but please be careful. I would not have expected to fall into a very rarely category."
5,I Can't Thank Him Enough,"This is well researched and is absolutely the best resource I've found for treating Lyme and co-infections. I've been ill for 23 years, and traditional treatment failed me (as did my insurance company!). Additionally, I have many allergies and sensitivities. I'm doing well so far with this protocol, and I have hope for my future.Besides finding extensive information about the treatments, you will gain an invaluable understanding of this illness.I strongly recommend adding this to your arsenal!"
2,Disappointing,"Yes, I realize the book was advertised as a comprehensive book on herbal healing of Lyme Disease. And Yes, the spirochette descriptions were great.However, I don't feel that there was enough space given to traditional treatments and how they work. Also, not much is written about late stage lyme.I really don't care to know where an herb came from or how it is harvested, I just want to know what works and how it works."
1,"Lacks Any Footnotes or Transparency for All Statistics, Claims, and Referrences","I found this book very troublesome. The book presents itself as a technical and thoroughly researched guide to healing Lyme- and nearly every page is filled with statistics that claim to be derived from clinical trials - however, absolutely none of the clinical trials are sourced, making it impossible to fact check. I find this lack of transparency highly problematic. If you quote statistics from clinical trials, you should include a footnote so that readers can see what study that information was derived from. This book presents itself as very technical (and is very difficult to follow); it is packed with statistics and claims, and absolutely none of them are sourced. To me, this suggests that there is actually no clinical evidence to back up any of the claims made by this book."
1,Book Review,This book is too much for professionals ...I will return it. I got so little out of it that it is not worth my keeping.
5,If ever I could paint this way,"Rien Poortvliet takes you on a journey of imagination and helps you wonder why god created the world the way he did. If you read carefull, you will see he never questions the existence of god, but still he would never want to force his religion on you.What remains, is a unexpected travel through time and the adventures Noah must have faced.Besides that Rien will show you how odd all these diferent animals could have looked, if only a tiger would have had the coat of a cow, or a cow would have been created like a snake. The idea seems odd, but somehow it does seem to come natural in this great picture book."
5,Can I give it 10 stars?,AWESTRUCK is the only word to describe my reaction to this magnificently beautiful book! It is a huge collection of Poortvliet's master quality artwork in a stunning coffee table book. The thoughtfully executed art gives evidence of the artist's heart toward the subject matter. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
1,Wrong book,The book I was sent was not the one pictured. It was a tiny 2 inch square board book not even written by the right author!
3,Colorful Retelling of Noah's Ark,"Noah's Ark is an excellent introduction to this biblical tale. The story is presented with simple language and lots of pictures of animals. The animals are presented in such a way that you can engage in as much conversation with your children as you might want (""those are green crocodiles""). I'm not a big fan of the pictures, otherwise, but the book's not really for me!"
2,"Good for animals, not for theology!","While my son (2.5) loves the pictures in this book, the theology drives me crazy. I can handle the ""wicked people"" mentioned by others although I wonder what my little guy thinks. The thing that drives me nuts is the fact that the redemptive rainbow at the end of the story, which means God will not do this again, is missing!
