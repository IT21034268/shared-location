1,The worst shave ever,"I did not received the 20 pack cartridges as they show at the picture, instead they send 4-5 pack, weird, fake, defected and horrible to shave with.I Do not recommend to buy this product from DAB Nutrition, it is not fare with the buyer, neither use Amazon to sell this BAD quality product!"
2,"Product Shipped fast, but overall a disappointment","Razor blade refills are an older type, not the same as in stores now. Older version from couple years back, won't buy from here again. After shipping you only save about $9 anyways"
5,Absolutely righteous!!!,"Great musicianship and well throughtout lirycs. It's brilliant, original, melodic, fast and vicious. Weel done melodies, incredible solos. Can't go wrong with this one!!"
5,Awesome Metal,"As the reviewer below me says, this does remind me of Arch Enemy's melodic guitars. Nightrage's latest album here has riffing guitars and solos from start to finish. Being Nothing was the first song I ever heard by these guys, off of a second disc from Napalm Death's latest album. The first time I listened to this album, I was very impressed. After listening to this, I decided to get their last album, Sweet Vengeance. These guys are definitely one of my favorites out there right now, ranking with Arch Enemy, Shadows Fall, Trivium, and Killswitch Engage. Now I know how those other bands sound, but I'm an all around rocker, I listen to just about any type of rock (except punk/emo). If you love metal with crunching guitar solos and heaviness, then this will make an excellent addition to your collection! Once again, I cannot decide which song is my favorite, every song on this outing is amazing!!!!"
5,Vitamins for Diabetics,This is a great mixture of essential vitamins for those who suffer from diabetes and need that little extra something for a decent pick-me-up during the day.
4,Good product,The analog control was very hard for me to get used to. Seems to have needless cut scenes between each shot. Tiger reacts to his shot. Tiger gets ready for the next shot. Tiger approaches the ball. Just let me swing!!
2,Glitch City,"This game is fairly fun, but substantially no different to past versions of Tiger Woods PGA Tour -- except in that it is full of silly glitches. The worst of these is that created golfers periodically vanish from the save files for reasons that nobody has been able to explain to me. This renders the ""career"" part of the game essentially worthless as an ongoing concern."
1,too sensitive control,i have been playing tiger woods for years and i was so good i could beat all the players including super tiger woods.when this game came out i couldnt even keep the ball in the fairway.thats how sensitive and how much they changed the controls of this game.i dont know why they had to change this so much.maybe its the new controllers compared to the old xbox controllers which i prefer since i have big hands.also when you go online everything is just so confusing.i play other online games and never have a problem but with this game there is so many things showing and it just looks like a big old mess.hard to make any thing out.
4,Great game!,"This is the 1st Tiger Woods game I've owned since TW 2004 for PS2, and I haven't been disappointed. Swinging with the thumb stick takes a lot of practice, as it is much more sensitive than past editions.The gamer face works very well. I took a picture of myself and my daughter with my personel digital camera, uploaded them to the EA Sports game face page and then imported them to my 360. The resemblances are very strong.Loads of game modes make this game quite enoyable."
4,Good but be forewarned...,This is a really good piece of fiction. The author obviously has an imagination and talent for bringing obscure people to life. However this book stretches my idea of historical fiction. The story starts when the historical figure is supossed to have died. It is simply an idea as to what COULD have happened if he lived which isn't that likely. A very good book...just don't be disappointed when you find out none of it happened!
2,Cleopatra's Heir,Theme is an interesting alternative to the reality but it fails to keep up the suspense and falls into a predictability that made reading the next chapters less and less compelling.
5,Latin Splendor,"This CD is a far cry from the stale, assembly line, corporate generated music of mall land America. If there is any justice in the music industry this will be a grammy nominated album. But if history continues to repeat itself, that will not be the case. In any event, I hope these talented individuals will keep making music for a long time to come!! I'm telling all my friends about this CD. It will be a long time before it's removed from my player. What a treasure!!!"
3,Great highs - bad lows,"My first exposure to the Iguanas was when they opened for Los Straitjackets in Atlanta; and after seeing their opening set, I wondered how the 'jackets could follow them up - they were that good live. Their blend of styles & instrumentation is terrific. So after special-ordering '9-Volt', my hopes were high. It has some great songs - the title track is especially wonderful. But there are a handful of throwaways - notably 'Flame On' and 'I Dig You' - which have such predictable lyrics, and are so 'rhymey' they draw a wince at every listen. The Spanish language songs and the instrumental sections are terrific, but the singing in English is often trite, and even the studio tricks used to beef up the vocals still can't quite make them sound more than overly conventional."
2,No staying power,"A very lackluster effort. Sophomoric lyrics and for the most part had nothing to distinguish itself. I liked the title track a lot, and a couple of other ballad type songs, but the rest was poorly done and little imagination."
1,secret diary of god,"started very good, but it soon turned it a total nonsense i would not recommend it.the jokes about the devil and god where not really good although the idea behind this was good."
2,Dissapointing :(,"Comparing this to 2K8 just in terms of gameplay and graphics I have to say this is a dissapointment. I liked last years PS2 version better than this weak offering. This game is not worth the $60. Too many INTs returned for TDs, too many returns period, can I return this game EA? Madden is not out as I review this, so we can only hope.2K8 Looks and plays better than this, but only has the legends and make believe teams. I'm calling for some competition because EA has lost its way."
2,Versus Mode unplayable,"The Graphics are cool, the Campus mode is great but the game is missing the most importing thing in a football game and that is hiding your plays. This game is not playable when it comes to versus mode, because you can see what plays your opponent picks and they can see yours, this is the dumbest thing to have been put into a football game. I really like the College Football atmosphere but having someone be able to see my strategy and being able to prepare for it kills the game completely."
2,Very disappointed,"I just brought NCAA Football 2008 for my PS3 which I recently purchased. I was so excited until I popped the game in. First off, there is only camera view you can play on. I've always played the ""side view"" because it looks like your watching it on TV. Second, the characters look a little pudgy and too ""comical"" if you ask me. They look like they came off from some anime movie. However, the tackling was awesome and gameplay ain't too shabby. Has anyone played it for the xbox 360? If so, is the side view still available? I'm going to keep my PS2 version for now since its way better than this one."
2,Ncaa 08,"This game is very predictable, game play is average at best. How can playstation 2 games be better than playstation 3, makes no sense to me. When you play someone you can see the plays they call, because the play highlights when you choose it.the average gamer can pick this up! the only good thing is graphics are better.EA sports games on playstation 3 are thrash, dont get me started on that playstation 3 Madden 07 garbage! try again."
3,Gameplay Gameplay Gameplay,"I own both the PS3 and 360. Tested NCAA 08 on both. Bought PS3 Version. Graphics slightly better believe it or not on 360. However, gameplay much better on PS3. On 360, turnovers occur on every series. Not so on the PS3. If they would take the best of both and somehow blend them together, then they would have a great game."
1,WORSE GAME EVER,This game is the worse game ever the only good thing about this game is that they got the team names right!
1,Awful.,"Football programmed by engineers and marketing execs. Ths games has zero heart and has absolutely nothing to do with football. Stay away! The passing game is like Chinese algebra and even with a slider setting at 0, I had 6 INTS in a AA game. Granted, I'm not great but my QB is rated 91. I finished 15/28 with 3 TDs and 6INTS.And long passes? It's a total coin flip. Your guy could be rated 30 points highre and your QB in the 90s they'll have a 63 rated CB will intercept 2 or 3 times despite being 5 to 10 yards off the play or having his back turned.Can you guys at EA stop relying on people who've neve played the game to program it?I played in high school and even I can tell how off your programming is. But hey, shame on me, I bought your inferior product again. When th eheck will I learn. Competition please!"
3,why cant i create,i think the game is great in all aspects except that EA did away with creating a school put that back on the game EA.
3,Screen Pass Glitch,"I have been a fairly loyal fan of the NCAA Football series since the 2003-2004 version. Most of the other reviewers have hit the high and low points of this version. After having played four to five versions of this game I cannot understand why the haven't changed the code which has the AI team execute a screen pass on third down only to have the running back step out of bounds and loose a couple of yards. Are the play testers at EA that bad? Maybe they just laugh as hard as I do when this happens over and over again. Whatever the case, it would be nice if they actually fixed this glitch."
1,EA is junk!,"The quality of EA games has gone down hill. Why is it that only EA can make college football games? I am a huge fan of college football and I did like to play the football games! But after EA sad performance in `07 I will no longer buy their football game, and unfortunately they are the only one out there. What ever happened to 989 studies? I think it is time for competition!"
2,Wouldn't buy if I could do it over,"Pros:pre snap options on defense are pretty cool. Gameplay graphics are pretty fun.Cons:Can't make a new team, can't customize playbook, can't do formation subs, can't stop someone from going in motion, menus are slow and painful, setting depth chart is painful because the sorting by default is quite poor and never remembers what you do, kicking can be a real pain with the R3 options, play calling is overly complex and not intuitive (defaulting you to special teams formation on a 1st and 10 ?!?!) there are other things, but I'm tired of typing now."
3,Can You Believe They Took Create A Team Out!!!!!,"So all in all I think this game is kind of run of the mill. I've been an avid EA college football fan for years now. The one thing that always brought me to the game was the ""Create A Team"" mode. There was nothing better than making up your own cupcake team, building it's schedule and taking it from nothing to a powerhouse, worrying if you were going to get fired as a coach.I was definitly dumbfounded when I got the game in the mail opened it up and spent 2 hours trying to find the create a team option. To my surprise it wasnt an option.I don't understand how you can take such an above average game and turn it into an average game.If anyone is like me and enjoys this great option stay away and play your PS2 and maybe next year they'll smarten up and put it back in.Shame on you EA, shame on you!!!!"
1,"Larger system, fewer options?","The simple fact that they have removed options such as ""Create a Team"", as well as taking away the ability to play the game in demo mode, has me regretting buying this at all. Other reviewers are correct in saying that EA are churning out the same product over and over, but they are also removing options from a game designed for a system with the ability to handle so many more options than before.It seems as if it will be another 5-10 years before EA Sports has any idea of what the PS3 can do. Then it will be another five years before they put it to use."
4,"Very useful, but with minor inconsistencies","There is a lot of detail in this book and it was a great help in planning my trip around Northern California. My only gripe was the intro at the front recommended two hostels that were in old lighthouses on the coast, but turning to the relevant section to get their contact details and they aren't listed! That was annoying but overall its a fine guidebook."
3,Disappointed in Kindle edition,"I bought this for my Ipad, and was disappointed the Kindle edition does not include the color plates. It doesn't appear to even include the plates in black and white. At least, there are no hyperlinks in the index to the plates. Text is interesting, but loses context without the illustrations."
3,A Good and Basic Introduction,"It is a simple, basic, easy to understand introduction to the beautiful images, meanings, and the historical background of the tibetan buddhist images for practice (""yidam"", erroneously translated as ""god"" or ""goddess"", but the real meanning is ""a hidden potential for your ilumination and transformation who live inside of you, and waits for awaken""). But, if you will practice in a daily basis for a long time, you will need the original images, because this ones are so incompletely painted. They are useful just for the very beginners. A Buddhist monk."
1,Warranty,I have had 2 of these in 2 years Cusinart DCC 2000 coffee maker and would not recommend because I had same problem with both. They would not honor the warranty due to the age.Would not recommend due to the POOR service dept and repeat failure with the same problem.
4,Cuisinart Central Programmable Coffeemaker,"We bought this item after reading it's the best overall coffeemaker in Consumer Reports. The only complaints we have is the control setting buttons are somewhat small and hard to read, the digital clock is not illuminated and the water-fill line is not visable from exterior of machine. Otherwise, it lives up to its reputation, makes terrific coffee (much better than our old Black & Decker), keeps coffee warm for up to 3 hrs and carafe is comfortable to use, easy to clean. Worth the money."
1,Has Issues...,"This is a great product when it works correctly. The one purchased this time still has issues, the hot plate is doesn't keep the coffee as hot as it should and I have found that the unit may shutdown by itself when in the process of making coffee.Consideroing sending it back for a refund......."
1,Reconditioned - not like new,"This reconditioned product had very bad blemishes on the face and sides of the stainless steel. Looked like an amateur used an electric drill with a wire brush and made the coffee maker look worse than it probably was before ""reconditioning"". I never tried it to see if it functioned OK and returned it immediately. The appeal of this coffeemaker is its appearance but it suffered greatly due to its reconditioning.Also the brass screen filter is not included ($10 more) and the warranty is reduced from 3 years on a new one to 3 months on reconditioned models. Not a good value to me."
5,ZERO Complaints,"""You pays your money, you takes your chances.""Could I be more pleased with this purchase? I think not. For more information about the machine in general, read the other reviews that provide more product descriptions.Ratings follow, in the order of my personal preferences.Performance - It makes coffee exactly like my mother's non-refurbished model, but I saved a bundle!Condition of Machine - Perfect, no scratches, dents, or marks. Brand new appearance.Packaging - No issues with packaging. It got here unscathed, so why bother looking for issues.Amazon Shipping - Ordered - 2nd, shipped - 4th, received - 6th. I'm close to distribution!Gold Filter - Not included, but not an issue. I actually prefer paper filters.Charcoal Filter - One included.FYI to those shopping online for replacement charcoal filters. I recommend you comparison shop as I found there are a variety of prices out there."
2,Be careful when refurbished.,"Although I am sure 99.9% are fine, my refurb. started leaking before I had used it a whole month. The coffeemaker looks nice and does make good coffee. But,now I have to go to the trouble and expense to return it. Thumbs down on my Cuisinart Refurbished Coffeemaker:P"
5,Best coffee ever!,We used this coffee maker on vacation at a friend's house. We had to buy one when we got home. This reconditioned model has worked perfectly.
1,bad choice,My husband and i purchased this coffeemaker about 7 months ago. we thought it would look sharp in the kitchen (and it does). BUT everytime you lift the lid to make a new pot it drips water (condensation) down the back of the unit. yes we have called the manufacturer but they just suggested a new insert (it didnt help). so i would not recommend this maker.
4,Factory-reconditioned Cuisinart DCC-1200FR Brew Central,"Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker, Black and Stainless SteelThe price for this coffeemaker could not be beat. It arrived later than stated by several days. The machine was in very good shape for being reconditioned. It did have a few blemishes on the lid, but other than that it runs perfect and is definitely producing a better cup of coffee than our former coffeemaker. It is a little difficult to pour the water through the back opening but if you use the glass coffee pot to measure the water this works well. I am not sure why it did not come with the gold coffee filter cup. This is not necessary, but should have been included with the price of a reconditioned coffeemaker. Overall we are very pleased with the unit."
5,Cuisnart Brew Coffeemaker,"Coffeemaker is easy to use and brews a delicious cup of coffee. Easy to use, clean and maintain. Excellent value and quality."
2,Cuisinart DCC1200FR,Just purchased one of these and would have to say that they are not reconditioned to be new completely. Mine arrived with the warming plate looking used. Otherwise in good condition. No gold filter included. I have bought other electronic equipment in the past that was referb and most arrived in excellent condition. I would say that the referb company has no QC controls before sending units back into the field. Bottom line watch for discounts and purchase new. (may try as a boat anchor)
3,It was not what I thought,"After having read several source books to the Forgotten Realms campaing setting, I must say that I hardly even recognise the Witch- Queen of Aglarond. The book was entertaining but itdid not seem to fit with the campaign. Now I have to decide which Simbul I like the best..."
3,"Dry, too many good stories supporting a bad one.","I was a little let down by this one. Unfortunately, there just wasn't enough information on this new class of characters, and their history was somewhat left to the readers imagination. Furthermore, the smaller sub stories (like Red Wizards and such) were much more interesting than the whole story of the anciant race of elves. To bad, it had promise."
2,another book that noone needs...,"Mmh...I really do not like these all powerful invincible characters like Elminster, the Seven Sisters and the Simbul, being one of them. It is just too easy for them to destroy hordes of powerful ""evil"" enemies with a mere thought. The story about these half-elves was quite interesting, but not captivating and I somehow felt, there was some kind of solution missing at the end. If you don't collect the FR books, you can skip this one."
2,What was this book about??????,"I have read this book so many times and every time I shake my head and wonder where it is going and what is it about??? Even the title makes no sense,what was her gift??? Her name to the zulkir at the end??? what was that about??? that horse she wanted to give to Elminster??? Why would a 600+year old sorceress give a 1150+year old wizard a stupid horse for his birthday??? The bottom line is that the book makes no sense whatsoever.Why did she dream up some plot about red wizards when it doesn't go anywhere???Another Lynn Abbey book that makes no sense,but at least it wasn't as bad as that stupid pitiful attempt to write about Hamanu of Urik"
4,"Good Live Show, But....","This album will give you a good idea of how Daryl Hall & John Oates sounded live in the late 70's and early 80's. Be aware though, that this album is the same as ""Ecstacy on The Edge"" that came out a few years back, just so that you don't end up getting two copies."
4,good basic mute,This is the standard for mutes used in school so we bought this one and it works fine for my middle school son.
5,It's hard to beat a classic..,At 56 years old not playing since high school I decided to start playing with the local community concert band. Never owned a cup mute in high school but finally needed to get one. Bought this one since most of the guys had this. Best way to blend with the rest and they still make them the way they did over 40 years or more.
1,Humes & Berg Stonelined Trumpet Cup Mute,I am very disappointed in this product. I owned a mute like this years ago and thought I knew what I would be getting. However H & B has changed the composition of the mute corks. They are now a composite of cork and rubber. In attempting to fit the corks to the bell of my trumpet I find that even 60-grit sandpaper will not touch this stuff. Also the corks are the thickest I have ever seen on a new mute and I have been playing trumpet for over 50 years. The mute will not even stay in the bell of my trumpet and is totally useless.
2,Nothing new here...,"If you're a U2 fan you've heard this all before. A spoken commentary of the band's early beginnings at Mount Temple through their rise to superstardom until the relatively recent Pop album. Each chapter is punctuated by a comment from the band (usually Bono). The CD would benefit from samples of the songs discussed and more actual commentary from the band - the lack of these probably due to legal constraints. Overall, the CD is good for what it is - a chronogical description of a band's rise to fame. It's value would be for those new to the world of U2, but for the ardent fan it's all old news."
1,No original music,"I was disappointed to receive the CD and read on the back cover ""This is a spoken word product and contains NO original music by the artist."" This was not disclosed in the product description or song list."
2,Looks better than it reads,"This book purports to be about technologies for finding bombs, but actually is a vehicle to discuss the current state of the art in additives ( called 'taggants') to the zillion pounds of the various black and smokless powders manufactured yearly.It actually has some value as a reference guide, and does state correctly that taggants should not be implemented."
2,Modernization ruins this performance.,"This disc contains a performance of Robin et Marion that, unfortunately, includes a number of spoken parts that have been rendered in modern English. This is regrettable as they (a) are badly done, and (b) detract immeasurably from the mood of a rather good musical rendition."
5,Kilpatrick Conversion Top Ping Pong Table,This is a great table. It is very sturdy and is of high quality materials. Comes in two pieces that has built in connectors to keep the table from separating during play. Just place one half of the table on top of your pool table and then place the other half on the table as you guide the two interlocking plastic connectors together. Extremely easy to install. Easy to install the net too. I set up the table in less than 5 minutes. The only drawback is that the table is heavy so you'll probably need help lifting. Amazon's delivery service was great too. The freight truck company called me to set up the delivery and delivered it on the Sunday before Christmas. They brought the 120 lb. box into my garage without any complaints. I then took the table out of the box and then carried it into my basement for installation.Martin Kilpatrick 5/8-Inch Pool Table Conversion Top
4,Quality Ping Pong Top,"Very good product. Well made. However, I went with this model because my pool table is a regulation 9' (50"" x 100"" playing surface)and this was supposed to be for oversize tables but it still wasn't large enough to fit. I had to remove the metal edge around the bottom perimeter of the table so that it would work. I am satisfied with the table now that I modified it and I don't think there is another conversion top available that will fit without some trouble, at least not at a comparable price. After shopping around I can say this was by far the best deal especially with the free shipping from amazon."
4,Martin kilpatrick 5/8 in pool table conversion top,"Excellent table- quick delivery easy to transport, one -person assembly , beautiful blue finish, this sturdy ping pong table fits perfectly on full size pool table"
3,Self-indulgent paean to the author's father,"If you know anything about the history of Ireland in the 20th century, you may enjoy reading personal stories about some of the major players. However, critical and objective students of history should be forewarned that much of the book is spent praising Eamon de Valera and his political work, and the author writes with all the hero-worship of a little boy who has yet to see his father as fallible. Additionally, the younger de Valera tries hard to convince the reader that his father was possessed of a great sense of humor; however, the jokes and ""amusing"" anecdotes in the book just aren't funny. The writing is often stilted and flat, and the reader is treated to such strange statements as ""When in Poland, I met many Polish people."" The book is saved by the personal look at Sinead de Valera, who maintained a minimal public profile during her husband's political career and whose life story has only rarely been examined."
1,Save Your Money,"This DVD is not a tour of Chicago at all ... this is simply a camera set in a few places around the city and watching the activity ... I believed that this DVD would be a tour and show the many exciting places in Chicago ... but it is far from that ... save your money, the picture on the cover is the best part of the DVD"
1,Garbage,This is amateur video. Someone set up a camera on a tripod and let it run for 5 or 10 minutes at each Chicago site. Not even any good transitions. Boring! It would have been more interesting if they just used still pictures and created a slide show. Don't waste your money on this one.
3,You get what you pay for,"We used this juicer just twice before the motor fried. I think for very limited use like one or two lemons, this could work fine, but it was half full of lemon juice when it died. I do not recommend this."
3,works but.....,"when i pulled it out of the package it had some icky glue-like substance on it,pain in the butt to get it off! works fine though besides that"
5,Can't beat it for the price!,I have had a hankering for some fresh squeezed OJ forever so I bought 10 lbs of oranges and this juicer for a big family breakfast. It works great. Having worked in a restaurant before and fresh squeezed juice was on the menu I'm familiar with pro juicers... I'm sure there are better consumer juicers out there but they all cost well over $80. We love it and won't be going back to buying juice again! Now if I only still lived in FLA ....
5,This was the right choice for us.,"This is a great choice. It works as it should. It cleans easily. It's priced right.I've used it for Oranges and Grapefruits. The bowl and lid twist off for use as a pitcher, for storage of juice in the fridge and of course, for cleaning.The pulp catcher traps most of the pulp but lets enough through to make for a pleasantly pulpy product.If the manufacturer is reading this, a second larger cone for Grapefruits would be nice.I'd buy another one as a gift if the occasion arose."
5,Excellent juicer,I've owned this juicer for over a year now and have not had any problems with it. I've done a good amount of work with it (I'm now consuming a box of oranges for juice every week) but only using it for small amounts of time (only 1-2 cups of juice at a time). Would recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap reliable juicer.
3,Works loudly!,"This little juicer does its work, but it's loud, I have to juice the oranges in the garage so that I won't wake up the family."
4,Oster Juice-n-Serve 27 Oz,"This juicer does a nice job. It leaves pulp, good for all of us. If that's not what you want the juice can then be strained. The juicer cleans up well in the dishwasher. This is a great buy and a lot better than others on the market."
2,Does not catch pulp effectively.,"I did a couple of hours of research before buying this juicer, but an important piece of information was missing from the reviews of this product: Its slots for letting juice through the pulp-catch tray are quite large, and the juicer yields juice with a whole lot of pulp. There are no other settings, and although I considered a self-installation of some kind of a sieve material, I decided I'd rather just return the thing and buy a different one.If you are someone who buys pulp-free or low-pulp orange juice at the grocery store, this juicer is not going to give you juice the way you like it."
3,It's Okay,"This juicer can't compare with the old Oster juicer I had that died after 20 years of daily use. Many times I would make as much as a quart of juice a day with no problems at all. It was easy to use and worked extremely well even when I'd make a couple of quarts. This new one is light weight and generally feels flimsy. I should have taken the old Oster someplace for repair instead of sending it to the ""graveyard.""""New and Improved"" doesn't mean better. On the positive side: having the container a good size pitcher is very"
3,too much work,Too much pulps in the juice. I had to filter the juice again and again before feeding it to my baby. I ended up just give my baby Tropicana juice instead.
3,Juice and Serve,"The juicer was delivered on time. Luckly, the juicer was not missing any parts. I did not expect the product to be delivered as it was. I was disappointed how this product was delivered by Amazon. The box was delivered in its original box which did not hold up well through the rigors of the shipping process. Normally, if a product is packaged in its original box, then it is still packaged in a shipping box so that if there is wear and tear during the the shipping process, the shipping box endures that wear and tear."
2,Replacing after 3 days,"The motor is weak and the reversing mechanism does not work very well. Unless you push exactly at the right angle, it quickly changes directions back and forth doing nothing. It only has one size attachments which is fine for limes and lemons but too small for grapefruit. The window to measure the amount of juice does not go all the way to the bottom, stopping at 7 ozs. I usually only squeeze 4 oz for margaritas, so I have to open the unit to see how much juice there is."
1,Poor quality,"Every time I put an orange on it, the gears would slip. In reality I bought a had juicer and threw this one out. I was not satisfied at all. Years ago I had a Black and Decker juicer I loved. Then I melted it in the dish washer. This one didn't hold a candle to my old one."
5,easy to use/cleanup,"I am very happy with this juicer. It is small, reliable, and easy to clean.I have used this to make perfect orange juice and to juice limes/lemons for the Master Cleanse.For $20 people should not expect this to juice boxes of fruit. I mean, come on. Go buy a commercial juicer.This is perfect for the home."
1,NY Consumer,"I have owned similar juice machines before, so I know what to expect. This machine really doesn't have a strong enough motor. You put slight pressure on spinner and motor stops. Plus the container is to big and a bit clumsy. I am sending this back."
4,Very Good for one or two people,"If you want a basic, not too expensive citrus juicer that requires minimal prep work and cleanup, then this is your item! It ain't pretty or shiny, doesn't have attachments or extras, but juices oranges and grapefruits very nicely - and quickly. Washes up nicely too. The only thing I don't like about it is that it strains ALL the pulp away from the juice, and I prefer my juice WITH pulp, thanks! But that's a small thing and easily fixed after I'm done juicing. And the carafe is nice, if a bit small - this won't work well for a large family or group of people - not only isn't it large in size, it requires a bit of hand strangth to work, and if you plan on squeezing more than a half-dozen oranges daily then this is NOT for you. But for one or two people who prefer quick-but-not-pretty utensils, this is perfect. It's lasted a good long while for me as well."
3,Juice and squish,"Pretty good for the job of juicing, cut the fruit in half, push onto the splined juicing head, and bingo you have shredded fruit and the juice drips through to the jug below. Works well but dont over push the fruit its not made of cast iron - better to pick ripe fruit then it works easily quickley making that fresh juice thats so good."
2,Wimpy Motor On This Juicer,"I love everything about this juicer except the most important part... THE MOTOR. The motor is wimpy and isn't fast enough, nor efficient enough for juicing citrus in my opinion.I have used a Cuisinart citrus juicer recently that works a whole lot better."
4,MR,item was reasonably priced and worked as stated. makes juice and all juice is collected in pitcher for you. its all plastic and is a good juicer at a good price for what i paid.thanks for fast shipping as well!
4,A Very Nice Home Orange Juice Squeezer,"This Oster Orange Juice squeezer is easy to use, to clean and works very well to squeeze a few oranges daily for a couple of 6-8 ounce glasses of juice. Because it has a light duty motor requiring a two minute rest after four continuous minutes of use (per the instruction manual) it is not recommended for heavy duty squeezing."
2,"Not 150 Watt, As Advertised","This juicer seems to work well, but beware that it is NOT 150 Watts, as the advertisement says. Instead, the motor is only 20 Watts, as stated on the bottom of the juicer."
4,The best solution with its own container,"This juicer is the best out of the ones that have their own container, but the ones that are simply juicers and you have to put a glass next to them for the juice to go into are more powerful and you can juice for longer. The bad things about this one is that 1- you can see the level of juice only on one side of the container2- it does not change spinning direction easily, you often need to push and release the fruit many times to get the extractor to spin the other way.3- obviously its much louder than a manual citrus press."
2,"Poor motor, an orange stops the movement mid-juice every time. Not worth bothering on this low-quality juicer.","Poor motor, an orange stops the movement mid-juice every time. Not worth bothering on this low-quality juicer....every time. Not worth bothering on this low-quality juicer."
4,Does what it says it does,Fine for juicing lemons and limes. A bit small for juicing medium or large oranges but it is possible. Easy to clean.
3,Oster Juicer OK,I bought this because of arthritic hands and it works well for me. For others it might be very slow to use but it does the job well for me. I had one problem with it and that was the tag on the cord warning that after handling the cord I would need to wash my hands since the cord contained lead. I found that problematic for a kitchen product. Otherwise the juicer works as stated but is a bit slow.
4,Well worth the price,"This juicer works very well and is very easy to use. I use it to juice lemons for lemonade and for morning orange juice. My only complaint is that the components are not dishwasher safe. If they were I would have given it 5 stars. Even so, it is easy enough to clean by hand. It's a very ueful addition to my kitchen equipment"
2,Appliace arrived covered in weird goo . . .,"sticky and clear like Vaseline, and as tenacious as chewing gum. I'm dumbfounded. We can't seem to clean it off, and I've tried everything in my arsenal! The juicer works fine, but what gives?!? (The bowl itself is clean, but the business part of the appliance is just gunky beyond belief!)"
1,A Bonafide Lemon!,"I should have paid attention to the negative reviews.However, many people were happy with this juicer,so I gave it a try. Forget about lasting onlythree days or even one day! This machine lastedthe time it took to juice half of an orange.Then,the motor died. I have decided to keep thetop component and use the contraption manually.Oster's warranty states that one should not returnthe appliance to the retailer, but call Oster's800 number for repair. However,for me that demandis too stressful to consider. From experience,that negotiation requires that I pay for shippingto and from the manufacturer. This has beena lemon experience all together! Caveat emptor!"
4,Nice Juicer,We have used this juicer for over 6 months now and works very well. It is easy to use (even my kids use it) and very easy to clean (one important aspect for me when it comes to appliances). We use it almost daily and seems to be holding up well.
5,Like fingering an angel,"I put these strings on my Martin D-15 and immediately had a waking wet dream. I know that sounds gross and it probably is... just being honest. Once i tuned up the strings i played an Em and it reverberated into my soul with its brassy twang which then made me have spasms of pleasure. Yeah, i said Em.. that's a sad chord! I KNOW! these strings are so good that it will make even the saddest of chords sound like audio pornography."
5,Good for a martin d15,I was trying to find something for a Martin D15 that would not mess up the neck and gave a little bit of sparkle. So far these are good and I was able to purchase them cheaper on Amazon with shipping than if I had brought them from Guitar Center surprisingly.
3,these strings are ok,"i usually buy these strings as cheap back up strings when i pop one at a gig or something. they're not too shabby at all. i mean they sound great when you first put them on. then the next day the sound fades and fades until, ""wow i need strings already."" i wouldnt use them for everyday use but the are perfect back up strings."
5,"The Adventures of the Wolderness Family, Part 2","I have been looking for a copy of this for some time, and found the product to be in excellent condition. Sound and color resolution was very good. No cracking or other defect was found. Great deal."
4,Agility Training,"This is a super book if your goal is to show in the agility ring. However, if you want a generic clicker training book then I would look elsewhere depending on what level you are looking for. I used this book for some of the basics but had to switch to another when it got more into the agility aspects of training. Just so you know what you're getting. If you are looking for basic consider Clicking with your dog, for obedience try Clicker Training for Obedience and if you just want to learn some tricks then try Quick Clicks. All of these books are quite good and they all build on the basics of clicker training.Have Fun!"
5,Wow! What a great book!!!,My wife bought me this book plus 4 others for my Birthday last June. This was the last of those books that I read and little did I know that I had saved BEST for last! Just a great book! I won't get into the story here because I feel too many reviews give away too much of the plot. Just pick this one up! You won't regret it!
2,Maybe I am missing something,"This book just didn't quite speak to me. I guess it just felt a little like a sledgehammer to the head. The two main characters just don't ring true. Jack, a beaten-down handicapped man in his thirties, has all the wisdom you could ever hope for. But where did he learn all this observational insight? He has lived his entire life in isolation. His friend, Holly, grows mature by the minute just by being around him.Both characters narrate the story which, at first, seemed inventive. But, eventually, it grew wearying to see their narration of the same events create giant leaps in the development time and time again.I was shocked to see 9 reviews each scored with 5 stars when I looked this book up here. Apparently, I am the one dissenting opinion. So, I have to admit I may have missed something that appealed to others. I felt the same way about The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold. So many people loved it, but I just didn't understand the appeal."
5,Excellent!,"This book was enchanting, inspiring and heartwrenching. I couldn't stop reading. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read."
5,very good,This book is ver helpful in understanding the methodological and therotical issues in public health
2,Tough read,I wish I could return this book. It was really hard to read and hard to follow as well as a bit superfluous.
4,Lovely basso voice,"Basso arias not familiar to me so I cannot compare Tian's voice or performance. To my untrained ear, he has a deep, velvety sound and a large vocal range."
2,Disapointing,"I purshased this CD based on the samples in amazon, but when I got it the album seems not to have any connection between the thems. Moreover is a CD room with short videos of landscapes. The price is good though I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Works Great,"I use this booster in a medium sized outdoor wireless network. With Hawking Products we are able to broadcast our network over a quarter-mile radius through trees, hills, and buildings. When I hooked this booster to our outdoor Hawking omni-directional antenna I was able to see an increase in our total coverage. This booster is well worth the money. For those that still have problems after hooking this up the problem is likely elsewhere in your network. The booster may not perform miracles...but it is worth the money."
2,OK,I wish I should have bought something else for my 9 year old Son. I built all items in 3 days and then fun is lost. It is not able to inspire you with various options like lego!
1,Motor and R/C components make this a huge disappointment,"Enjoyed building the set with my son. The RC components lasted about a day before the rear gear became stripped and the car no longer moved. Looking at the car, these are really low end components - not in line with the erector set components. Would not recommend. Buy either an erector set or a RC car - this set is a bad combination.Erector Radio Control Tuning Street Racer Set, 368 Pieces"
3,Could be better,"I'll give the author credit for writing a book that's different from all the other fly fishing books out there. This book is funny, and it's meant to be funny. The jokes and one liners were nonstop. But, I felt that the humor got a little repetitive. I grew tired of reading the same phrases over and over again. Personally, I would have liked to have read fewer jokes and a little more of his introspective thoughts. For instance, I liked the chapter called, ""A Tear and a Long-Tail Deer"", which was about fishing with his kids. It was pensive, sincere and funny at the same time. It showed a little more heart than the rest of the book and it still made me laugh. I just wish there would have been more chapters like that one."
5,100 snorts!,"Too funny, from start to finish. Tosches' account of being pushed into a river by a herd of dairy cows in Wyoming had me laughing until, well, until I stopped. Lots of great tales. Funny, and touching too! Only the miserable won't laugh their way through this gem."
1,Monstrously sophomoric,"The ""humor"" in this book is decidedly juvenile. MIGHT be a decent effort for a 7th grader. But any 7th grader who has discovered flyfishing would likely be too sophisticated to pen such rubbish. Worst fishing book I have ever purchased.I'll give my copy to anyone who will pay the shipping."
1,"Wonderful collection of cliches, worn out stereotypes and repetitive old bad jokes.","Being a writer myself, I typically don't review other people's work because of the subjective nature. However, at page 29 in this tome I decided to put this book in the recycle bin. Nothing but tired cliches, worn out jokes built on tired stereotypes, and the same hooks and writing crutches used over and over again...and that's in just four chapters.This book is horrible. Save yourself the pain and just buy an old Italian, German or Polish joke book as that's apparently where this writer stole most of his material."
5,great fly-fishing humor,"Everyone should go read Rich Tosches' book, ""Zipping My Fly."" From beginning to end, I was doubled over with laughter. Being an avid fly-fisher myself, the stories (i.e. Tosches hooking himself and friends with flys throughout the book) hit some of the tourments of fishing right on the nose. He also writes hilarious stories of fishing with his family that will make anyone want to go pick up this hobby. This book is great for all the fishers on your holiday shopping lists...and all the non-fishers as well."
5,Traditional Music at its Best,"Tim Lake is one of the most talented musicians (not just banjo players) of our time. He can play anything from bluegrass to classical (he's written his own concerto on the banjo). All the songs on this album are traditional, as Tim and his band play bluegrass, jazz and some Irish/Scottish tunes. This album was recorded live in a barn. You can't get any more traditional than that. I've let people who don't normally listen to banjo listen to this cd and they've come away fans of the banjo. I highly recommend this album to anyone who loves music."
1,Billy Sucks,"Billy, Phil, and all of this horrid crap should be thrown in a fire!! I've seen them at 1860's and they just bore me to death!! In addition Billy is all over the map, select a genre and stick to it......Gotcha!!! You just got punked!!!! Dude I'm just kidding!!!...Billy is one of the most AWESOME musicians I've ever seen, bar none!! So many styles and textures, he can make a lesser musician just flat out want to quit. I have stood in awe of him several times just going WOW!! I have been a fan since he played in Street Corner on the landing at BOGEYS's and I have to tell you, the only thing that makes the CD pale, is seeing him live!!!"
2,Outdated,"Before I bought this book, I should have checked when it was written -- mid'80's. Instantly outdating all of the material put forth in this racing handicapper's guide in the world of high tech information. Brohamer explains how to incorporate computer data bases of information and how to make the pc help you gather useful info. well, 20 years have passed since he wrote the book -- We know all that already.To put this in perspective, Brohammer writes this book BEFORE the Internet. As an example that is funny -- Brohammer shows a picture of a computer in his book -- from 1984 -- it looks like a kid's toy.No, don't buy this book. Virtually all of the information is woefully outdated. Unless, of course, you like wasting your money."
4,good collection of smooth jazz,Sorry to see WNUA go away...but this is a good collection of smooth jazz favorites.
4,NGK ME78 Spark plug wires,The price was excellent and they came in a timely fashion. I am totally happy with this product. I highly recommend this product.
4,Upset Customer,My displeasure is not with the product itself. The die-cast vehicle I purchased is really great. The amount of detail put into the car is amazing! My displeasure does not lie with Amazon either but with ShopZeus! I clearly requested a Silver-Blue model of the Crossfire and received a White one. I called ShopZeus and stated my complaint and requested a Silver-Blue model (this was a gift for a friend). The customer service rep. was friendly and eager to resolve the issue. They put in a request to have the correct colored vehicle shipped and even let me keep the white die-cast vehicle. I thought all was well until I received the second vehicle. It was another White Crossfire!!!! I called the customer service rep. again and explained the issue. At this point I just wanted my money back. Obviously the people at ShopZeus can't read and don't know their colors!!!!
3,"Wrong color, same as other reviews",The model is great in quality. better than I expected but it is white not the stated silver blue as advertised.I dont mind paying shipping again but I want a blue one as stated due to the fact my car i purchased is also silver blue. I hope no one makes the same mistake as this purchase.
5,Life-changing book that helped me find my destiny,"This is a powerful book that literally changed my life. If you are wondering what God's will is for your life, you will want to buy this book. Casey Treat clearly lays out the steps you can take to find your purpose in life. I highly recommend this book."
5,Great,"Very inspirational, encouraging,.............I really love this book and I recommend it for anyone that's trying to follow their heart's desires."
3,Casual reading and tips,"Yet another Taunton republication of old articles. This one packages a set related to cabinetmaking and cabinetmaking materials. You will not find detailed cabinet plans here, nor dicussions of alternative building methods in any comprehensive way, etc. What you will find is useful articles on materials and interesting tips (like the NK drawer bottoms), and so on. As such, it only makes for a casual read.If you are looking for serious cabinet design and construction books, especially for kitchen cabinets and built-ins, look elsewhere. A few I can suggest are:Illustrated Cabinetmaking: How to Design and Construct Furniture That Works, andCabinetmaking Procedures for the Small Shop. For drawers and doors specifically, tryBuilding Doors and Drawers: A Complete Guide to Design and Construction."
4,So many good books out there - this is one of them,"Michael Lewis continues to write some outstanding books. Like all of his previous efforts, this one is a must."
2,Does Michael Lewis have a point?,"I admittedly don't know much about Lewis' pre-Next work, but my intro to his writing wasn't spectacular. His promising subject (social implications of the Internet) died in three fairly boring narratives that you could've read about in the news, and the conclusion failed to bring those narratives together into any kind of meaningful message.But that conclusion by itself is worth a read, if for no other reason than to get you thinking about what Lewis was actually trying to say with the rest of the book."
4,The Review Just Happened,"The manner in which the book was split up made it almost impossilbe to get lost or bored. The colorful and witty language makes it an easy and interesting. The theories present a new perspective on the internet, and how it can change our society and mold today's economy. It shows that anyone can penetrate the market because of the invention of the internet. The idea of the pancake thoery is an interesting persective about access to information and equality of opportunity to relay messages. This and other insights make this book a must if you're looking to understand today's changing economy."
4,What's Next?,"Found the book very engaging, although at times it was a little unfocused. The stories were interesting. The sociological implications of the internet are staggering, considering the length of the book, it should of delved into the meaning of the impact further. Overall I would recommend other people to read it."
1,"Shallow, uninspiring, uninteresting","As a lecturer of e-commerce, I was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the Internet. However, I am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored. The author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the Internet has brought about. The result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic. I have nothing good to say about this book - money wasted."
2,A patchwork of recycled magazine pieces,"Michael Lewis fans are likely to be disappointed by his latest book. The BBC apparently backed the project, and it shows. The final result has much of the flavor of a BBC documentary: some picturesque scenery and an arresting moment or two, all patched together with a steady flow of banal commentary, in this case about insiders and outsiders and the notion of self-invention.The best moments come when Lewis skewers the doubletalk of Wall Street in an interview with the SEC's Arthur Levitt; however, this level of insight is missing from the profiles of young Internet players that make up most of the book. Moreover, much of this material will already be familiar to readers of the New York Times--over the past year or so, Lewis's stories on Tivo, Jonathan Lebed, and most recently legal ""expert"" Marcus Arnold have appeared in the Sunday magazine."
3,Information revolution,This book was just written after the dot com hype and the stock market collapsed. It tells a few stories about a 15 year old boy who beats professionals in the stock market and earns a few hundred K. It is about the internet that has changed a big part of the economy. I still think it is strange -- no ridiculous -- that building websites has started a whole new economy. It is strange that people have a day job running their virtual business in second life. Next shows and tells you that the world has changed and that the internet might be the next information revolution after the steam engine started the industrial revolution...
2,Fast Fun Read,Not a profound book. Lots of story-telling to make a few good points. A fast and fun read.
2,Quit while your ahead,"The book Next would of been an enjoyable read if the book was a hundred page shorter. This was the first time I had read any of Michael Lewis books, and with all the good reviews on it, I was highly disappointed by the end of the book. When I started the book, I was impress how he manage to interact with the teenagers he interviewed so well. He wrote about the teenagers smoothly and you really began to understand the position that their in. 200 pages later, he was still rambling on, writing lame jokes, and even poorer examples. I recommend that you get this from your local library, and not buy it. Read the fisrt hundred pages then return it for a better book."
4,Perspective,"It is difficult to appreciate the full implications of a transitional time while one is in the midst of it. Michael Lewis does a good job of exploring the implications of how the internet has changed us and how societal power has shifted dramatically because of it. He does an excellent job of looking at specific examples and then backing up for a wide-lense take on the bigger picture.People who are looking for a better understanding of the rapidly changing technological life we are living and what it means for the future will benefit from reading this.To me one of his most important points has to do with how the contemporary world favors young people who are best suited to adapt to the technological changes and thrive in the resulting dynamic environment. Those of us who are middle aged will, upon reading this book, find ourselves with some serious thinking to do in terms of how we craft meaningful work lives."
3,Not a bright rrquirement,"""Next"" is a most revealing identification of the fantastic rate of change that is and has occured. Ignore it at your peril."
2,What is NEXT?,"This is a book of disjointed short stories about things that happened in the PAST on the Internet. Although some of the stories are mildly interesting, the author doesn't provide any common theme on how these stories give us insight into what is coming NEXT? The author rambles on tangents about the indivuals or their families in the stories for much of the book. This may be a good book if you are totally in the dark about the Internet and Technology revolution"
4,Very Interesting,"Very digestable non-fiction. Some theories are a little on the edge, but according to Lewis, that is the place you want to be. I would recommend this to anyone interested in marketing, technolgy and sales."
2,Okay but not great,Michael Lewis is a good author. Next: The Future Just Happened is not in the same league as most of his other books which you can`t lay down. I didn't have that problem this time.
2,Adequate,"Must confess I was a bit disappointed. Not as well written as Lewis's previous book. (Hey Don Mitchell...you get paid for that review?) Yes, some interesting points, but I didn't find Next to be that enlighting. Sorry"
1,"""Next"" is what I'd say about this book","Michael Lewis has some good things to say in this book, but there were so few gems, it was worth neither the time to listen to the tapes or the money to buy it. The first 25% of the book is devoted to the well-publicized case of Jonathan Lebed and the kid's violations of SEC rules. Only once does Lewis use the word ""Values"", but by that time, I had already figured out why I didn't like these people: with the exception of the kid's obvious talents, they were clueless and afraid of the world as it was evolving and I'm being nice about this. Lewis omits a deeper and warranted discussion of values and how dangerous this kid may ultimately become to himself and/or others in the future, whether it involves the internet or anything else. The premise of the book was good, but the end result was just a missed opportunity."
2,"Equivalent to a 4 hour movie, with a interesting subject","It literally resembled a fairly long movie. Most of the book was repetitive. Yet the actual subjects of the stories were mind boggling. I was not aware that such frauds and disturbing acts could be done from anyone's home. The novel used several words that I did not recognize; being more exposed to stocks would have been a great aid. Lewis's style of writing was continuous, dull, and at the same time it seemed like he was forced to write unnecessary jokes just to have more pages in his novel."
5,Please Help If You Can!,"I have watched all four season of Farscape at least 5 times the past two years. It's A GREAT show!Well I want to purchase this product, but I don't want the double sided disc. Can anyone else who has recently bought this product confirm that it now comes with 4 single sided Disc instead of the 2 double sided ones?Thanks You!"
1,THERE IS A CHEAPER WAY!!!!!!,"Farscape - The Complete First SeasonHey instead of buying the season box sets or the individual volumes buy the european region 2 pal dvd box set of the entire series! It costs about $200 dollars on amazon uk! Thats less than the first season in the U.S! Hey, I just saved you hundreds of dollars (and without Gieko)!"
3,Load of bullocks!,"I think it's absolutely abhorrent that they are releasing these so-called ""Star Burst"" editions. It's bloody expensive enough to get them the first time around. Why didn't they make it easy on the fans in the first place? It's not like they're the only people out there making a DVD of their series. Most other shows sell for about $50 a season and they have convenient packaging that doesn't consist of several regular DVD cases. I think whoever is running this band of monkeys needs to be knocked upside the head a few times. The only reason that I'm giving this three stars is because the series itself is so great."
1,what the frell is this?,"After I finally purchased every episode of farscape in their original formats on DVD, ADV films releases a cheaper way to get the episodes with more content. this really irritates me."
5,"Farscape Season 1, Collection 1 (Starburst Edition)",I can't wait for the next disc. This one was full of great extras and not one bit disappointed. I am always glad to be able to see more of the gorgeous Ms. Black!!
4,"Own one, bought as gift",My husband bought me one of these corn poppers for camping. It has been a hit of our campfire snacks. My bother-in-law requested one for his birthday. We will be trying it out over his fireplace at Christmas. One note-popcorn tastes even better in time as pan is used (seasoned).
1,TERRIBLE SERVICE,"We bought this item, paid shipping costs, it came with no handle for the popcorn popper, paid return shipping, requesting a new item, The seller refunded our money instead of sending a new corn popper. So we are out $14. in shipping costs and no email was sent to us why they could not send a replacement. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!"
3,Not the best protein source,"They taste as good as candy, but lets get the facts straight, this is not candy, it is protein bar, and the protein amount per carb is very low. If you are a serious athlete or weight lifter, these are not for you. Once again they taste great, and I eat them myself many times."
3,great for snacks and to curb hunger,"I ejoyed these bars for the most part. The leomon, chocolate mint were not flavors I liked at all though.Bars I did enjoy and find satisfying were awesome as meals or as a quick pick me up. They really did help help curb my hunger and help me eat less of the things I shouldn't."
3,Too wordy and lacks example,"Well like i said in the title, its too wordy and it lacks alot of examples. However, his explainations are quite clear and how Susan (a novice with no programming knowledge) keeps asking the author questions we would ask him is alright. If only his book had a touch of colour, less talking and more examples, this book would be a must for newbies. I'm only 15 and i learnt a great deal from this book but i decided i would learn Visual Basic first"
5,Great book for beginners,"This is a rare book in that it actually helps to understand difficult programming concepts in a relatable manner. Steve Heller's idea of using using his interaction with a novice to teach the subject is unique in a C++ book. Whether one is a novice or somewhere between a novice and an intermediate level programmer, there's much understanding to be gained by reading this book while not letting hardwired opinions get in the way."
3,too chatty,"I had expected a more technical approach in learning C++. This book is way too wordy and chatty. I was disappointed. Though it says that the book should be read by someone who was a sense of humor, it really failed to humor me..."
5,Best programming book I have read,"I read this book on my own, and felt like I learned more than when I have taken programming classes. It was very clear and easy to follow."
2,Bad for precision,"This mouse pad is slick and lets you zip around with little friction. The only downside is when you try to be precise, the mouse moves all over the place. Imagine trying to click on something and you see it suddenly tries to drag it. All I did was click, but the pad is so slick it moves the mouse just a hair. I've used multiple optical mice with it, and it's better to use the cheapo mouse pads because of this."
2,"Surface is great, rest of it is not.","Right after I purchased this mousepad, it started to cup or bowl. The actual surface is great, mouse is really responsive. Unfortunately, I've pretty much been restricted to the middle of the mousepad as the sides are unusable. Would return it, but I got rid of packaging - when does a mousepad break? Apparently, this one does. If they could correct problem, great mousepad."
1,Great for first ten days. Then throw it in trash,"The pad was awesome at first. Low profile, stuck to desktop, great tracking. Barely noticed it was there.Then, it lost all adhesion to the tabletop, and began to curl up like an old poster. I reverse curled it, heated it, everything. Its useless. Now it moves everwhere the mouse moves, and is thus worse than the bare tabletop. Waste of money."
5,Happy Customer,I originally bought this flag in 2006 and will be purchasing another due to the colors fading. Although not the manufacturer or seller's fault because it has been outside my home for over 2 years now. I live in New England and we face all kinds of weather so if you're looking for a nylon flag you won't have to worry about taking inside all the time and for a great price....this really is it. Thank you and GOOOO Red Sox!!
1,Home video masquerading as a movie!,"I first heard of this movie when I saw it up for auction at eBay, and wondered why I hadn't heard of it before, seeing as I am always looking for family movies and Chihuahua items both. But after one veiwing, I now know why! This is obviously a home video recorded by someone with too much time on his hands who somehow managed to get it packaged up nicely and marketed. With only a handful of actors, none of whom can talk in anything other than a monotone, and shaky film footage, I can't imagine how this ever got into production. I doubt that it would hold even a small child's interest. A serious waste of time."
1,Nacho Chihuahua,"Unless you really love Chihuahuas,don't rush to buy this. The packaging is professional and that's the only thing. The video has a very home-made quality, and is not entertaining enough for anyone over the age of two. I love Chi's and still felt embarrassed for this movie. They should remake this movie and hire some writers and actors. And at no time in the movie does a dog wear a sombrero.Very dissapointing movie."
3,Ohio Guy897 loves nachos,"OH MY ...!!!This is most amazingly excellent film I have ever seen. I was filled with tears and laughter during the entire film, sometimes at the same time! A breathtaking masterpiece! Certainly worthy of any of the high praise that people have given it."
5,Affliction-A Classic,Mrs. Schaeffer's book Affliction is timeless-a compassionate view of the challenges that humans face in light of a God who cares-
1,Not for the fit and active,"I hate to criticize this book since Mr. Kelley seems like a heck of a nice guy and does offer good information. BUT...much of the information about the surgery I got from my surgeon, pre-surgery classes at the hospital, hospital-provided literature and free sites on the web. I am 53 years old. I had my hip replaced Dec. 9, not using cement but natural knit. By Jan. 21 I was walking without a cane or crutches. But, I am younger and for 9 months prior, worked out hard - treadmill, stepper, weights, stretching. Within 10 days of surgery I was back at upper body weight work. I found the exercises from my therapist adequate. So if you are younger and used to exercising, this book is not for you. Older, not used to exercise, it may be helpful. It also does not mention aquatic therapy, a great vehicle, particularly for older hip patients."
2,The Tape Broke on me TOO!,"The cassette tape broke on me on the first time, through, as well! (I wish they had a CD version of the tape!) So don't count on being able to listen to it! The accompanying phrase book came in very helpful, however, when I was in cabs in Iraq and Jordan and needed to communicate basic destinations to cab drivers, etc (I was shooting video and photos during the 2003 American-led war on Iraq). I highly recommend simultaneously using more than one way into the language. The most useful for me were The Arabic Alphabet (Awde, et al) and Rosetta Stone Arabic, although both do absolutely nothing to help you understand the grammar."
2,Less than thrilling :(,"This was a rather disappointing purchase for me. I am a major Matchbox Twenty fan....DONT be misled by the ""by Matchbox Twenty"" or whatever in the title. This is a spoken history of the band and the members....which wouldn't be so bad if it were the band members doing the speaking. But other than a few audio clips (Taken from ""The Interview"" CD), the remainder of the CD is spoken by a British female narrator. There is no music by the band, few new revelations of the band, and next to no verbal interaction by the band. There were a few new things I learned about the lesser-known members of the band, but that alone is not worth this CD. Your money is much better spent on their music, or on ""The Interview"" Cd, which at least features the band members talking about themselves."
2,Matchbox Madness,"If you own ""The Interview"" then don't buy this . This cd lists the bands history with a few snippets from ""the interview"" and many dissapointments (especially the readers inability to pronounce Matchbox Twenty!) I am a huge fan of the band from England and ordered this with great expectation . It's nice to hear the history of the band from inception to superstardom but trust me , this is a listen once and forget you have . My advice - find someone who has it (or convince a friend to buy it) then listen and give back , no money wasted !"
3,'Tiger Beat' for Trading Spaces fans...,"I picked this up at the airport in Calgary after a long business trip. It turned out to be great airplane reading, but little more. Having said that, it's a fun, bright, glossy read for anyone who wants to know more about the on-camera talent. It doesn't so much go 'behind the scenes' as it tells you what your favourite stars are 'really like'. In that sense, it's really just a teen magazine for grown-ups; it even includes 'poster-size' pictures of the designers and carpenters (I suppose you could stick them on your freshly-made hay wall). Whatever you do, don't buy this book expecting a guide to interior design; this book is to decorating what 'Cosmopolitan' is to sex."
3,"Not as much fun as I expected, but good trivia","Well, I love the show, but this book wasn't nearly as much fun as I was expecting. I guess I wanted a more ""behind the scenes"" look, but the producers carefully maintain the big happy family image this show works so hard to create. Nevertheless, it is good for little tidbits on each designer. I reccommend getting it from the library rather than spending your money here!"
3,Not serious,With big two page pictures and a little writting this is more of a fun book. It get's old pretty fast. Plus points off for the two page spread of Hilldie.
1,A Big Disappointment,"Unfortunately this book is just ""trading"" on the popularity of the show. The suggestions are cheesy looking and not anyhing that most people would want to see in their homes. The show is entertaining, but there is no substance or useful ideas in the book."
5,If you love the show you have tobuy this,"This book looks and feels like the Trading Spaces TV show. If you love the show, you have to have this. Behind the scenes pix are good but what I really like are thte shots of rooms from the show. I can spend time enjoying rooms that went by too fast when I watched them on TV. The book is as fun as the show."
1,"Tiger Beat meets Ty, and Vern, and Paige, and so on.........","O.K. If you are a Trading Spaces fan you will probably find this book an amazing wealth of not so juicy tidbits. Sorry voyeurs, no real shocking scandals among the cast members, (I was kind of surprised that some of them had never been arrested for possession of narcotics or redecorating under the influence).My only gripe was that this book read like it was written for 13 year olds, kind of like those kids magazines we used to get in school and read aloud in class every Friday. Yea!!!! Weekly readers, thats what it reminded me of!!Don't look for any real good redecorating tips but you do get to see the carpenter TY in a ""Tiger Beat"" styled portrait for the ladies. For Serious Fans only."
3,"Not as much fun as I expected, but good trivia","Well, I love the show, but this book wasn't nearly as much fun as I was expecting. I guess I wanted a more ""behind the scenes"" look, but the producers carefully maintain the big happy family image this show works so hard to create. Nevertheless, it is good for little tidbits on each designer. I recommend getting it from the library rather than spending your money here!"
2,"Everything you ever want to know about Doug Wilson, but....","This book is a good example of savvy marketing at it's best. My husband and I have watched the show ever since the Alex Mcloud era, and we were hoping to get some tips and how-tos on some of the designs we've seen over the years. This book is basically a big biography of the designers- I could give a flying fig where Doug Wilson went to High School, I want to know how he does those cool paint techniques! If you're looking for tips and techniques like me, hold out until August- TLC will be releasing two more books from the TS camp; one on furniture, paint and fabric, and the other on accessories. However if you're really looking for poster-size photos of the designers (I kid you not), look no further."
3,Virtually no decorating tips,"If you want a book on decorating on a budget, this is not the one for you. If you want to know all about the personalities on Trading Spaces, then you will love this book. I used to be a huge fan of Trading Spaces until it became all about ""the reveal"" instead of creativity. The book has one page of generic tips from each designer, plus photos of some of their rooms, but nothing on how to accomplish the look. A much better purchase would be the Changing Rooms book."
2,Fluff,"While I loved getting a peek into the lives of my favorite designers (go, Vern!) I would have liked to get more information about actual decorating projects. I guess I was looking for more DIY substance. There is a little bit of it, but not enough to justify the price of the book. This is one you're better off borrowing from a friend, or checking out of the library - not necessarily for the permanent collection."
4,Fun but too busy,"I enjoyed reading this book for all the inside information it contained (the sewing people who do the actual work, the capenters' assistants) and also liked the biographies.However.....this was a difficult book to read. It was so busy, so ""hyper"" (much like the show!) that it was almost an assault to my eyes. I am sure that this design/format was intentional, but it made the book much less enjoyable for me. All the little boxes and sidebars made it impossible to read anything straight through.Other than that, it was a pleasant diversion."
1,IT'S ONLY AN INTERVIEW!,"this cd is good...if you like the corrs. There is no music from the corrs on this cd, just interview responses. it's difficult to understand because the background music is too loud. the interview questions aren't even stated on the cd, so it's difficult to know what the corrs are responding to and about. It includes the same interview as ""In conversation,"" except in ""In Conversation"" the questions are heard, there is no music in the background, but the downside is (on ""In Conversation"") that Sharon (violinist) is the only one responding, little comments from the others aren't heard, which is the only good thing about this cd. Overall, a better buy would be ""In conversation"""
5,Essential Dead,"This 3 disc compilation provides an excellent distillation of the four night run at the Fillmore West in 1969 that yielded much of the Live Dead album. The whole run is 10 discs, but this complilation has been done with a loving ear and eliminates duplicate tunes. Not that duplicated tunes are redundant in the Grateful Dead canon - each time a song is performed live it is a new musical adventure, especially the longer jamming vehicles that make up the bulk of this material. So, I disagree with an earlier reviewer that this set renders the 10 disc set redundant. However, given that the 10 disc set was sold out months before its release, that observation is itself redundant for most.This is a superb release, ranking with the very best Grateful Dead music available."
4,"Fantastic, but...","Buyer beware. For the 3 CDs of music here, I should give this set 5 stars, but I can't for one reason. The original tapes used for these recordings sound amazing for the age they are, but in a few places, in particular CD 3, a second source is used to fill in the gaps where the multi-track tapes ran out during recording. The bits used to patch up these missing pieces are from the same shows (just an alternative source), but they are not of the same pitch/tempo to the rest of the music!As for the rest, the music sparkles. If you love Live Dead, you'll love this."
4,Fillmore West 1969,"Pretty good performances. I don't like the fact that since 2001, the idea seems to be to erasing Bob's voice from the last 4 to 5 minutes of Lovelight on all the multitrack releases. Disc 2 starts with a cool pairing of Dupree's into Mountains Of The Moon. The Dark Star that follows is very good and it was recorded the night after the Live Dead version as is the following Saint Stephen. The Eleven is always nice to hear and this is no exception. Death Don't Have No Mercy is strong also. The That's It For The Other One that starts off the third disc is powerful. The Alligator/Caution jam is one of the best"
3,For die hard fans only,"Other reviewers have said it. This is very good stuff, but it shows that whoever put together Live/Dead really got it right. Die hard fans and dead collectors will love this. But since I don't quite rise to that level, I was a bit disappointed. Sure there are places were the band is off, but what this album really shows is what a mismatch Tom Constanten (on keyboards) was with this band. The five core members are starting to soar into new realms and Constanten's soul-less keyboard is often front and center in these recordings, keeping the group's left foot firmly nailed to the ground. In Live/Dead his damage was minimized in the mix somehow."
5,GREAT (but),"Great LIVE Dead , but if you stumble across the 10 cd set , buy it. I was one of the lucky ones to pre-order in time. This three cd set does a great job of showcasing more of what became ""Live / Dead"" , one of the best live albums ever by any band , but if you ever see that 10 cd....."
4,Not Definitive,"I think this is for committed fans mostly. Anyone not into the Dead yet is probably better off sticking with ""Live/Dead"", which, I think successfully took the cream off the top of this material.Nothing here's definitive. Not ""Dark Star"". Not the mind-bending ""Alligator-Drums-Caution"" sequence, which is better on the ""Anthem of the Sun"" bonus tracks as well as the fantastic lengthy ""Caution"" on DP16. Not ""The Other One"" which sounds fantastic in numerous places. Not ""Lovelight"" which has less energy here than the version used on ""Live/Dead"". This is nice to hear but less so than a lot of other available Grateful Dead in the remastered albums and the Dick's Picks series. This mainly tells us all ""whoever compiled Live/Dead, they did it just right and maximized the use of 2 LP sides""."
5,Cute--just like it should be!!!!,"Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon has the cutest theme song! I love Kirari Sailor Dream so much!!!I have not heard C'est La Vie, but it is cute play on words...(In the series, Minako Aino is the pop idol who sings this song, but she is also Sailor V...which, in Japanese, is pronounced the same as C'est La Vie)You should also check out Candy Baby by Chieko Kawabe...I think she sings Kirari Sailor Dream...I'm not too sure..."
2,Sailor Moon live action,I wanted this for my daughter and at first it palyed fine then time stop responding. So i wrote to the seller and ask for the disk that didn't to be replaced. He wrote back and said fine but I never recieved them and when I wrote again he never reponsed. So I would not recommand this version to anyone in fact when ask by friends I told them not to buy this one. I waiting for a better version to come oout.
5,How to head off software problems at the pass,"A powerful pick indeed. Kevin Tate's SUSTAINABLE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: AN AGILE PERSPECTIVE blends basic software-building ideas and practices as they relate to the business environment, showing how to maintain a consistent pace, keep code base in readiness between releases, and prevent defects rather than doing damage control after. Chapters advocate flexibility, using ready tools for analysis, and understanding routines and approaches which encourage backlogs and poor releases."
4,Comfort and warmth,"After buying two pairs from Eddie Bauer, my wife adores these slippers. Not only comfortable and warm but with more support and a sole that won't fall apart. Can't beat the quality! But since it's 90 degrees now, we won't see them for a few months."
5,I can't wait for volume 2,"This is an awesome video! The moves are relaxing yet toning. Ms. de Phillipo, if you read this review, could you make another video and incorporate Kundalini Waist circles into the routine. (to me, that is the move where you are sitting on the floor and are ""mixing a huge bowl that is between your legs""). I have never seen them in a DVD before. Very happy with this DVD! And I like the things she says, like ""reaching for your goals and dreams."""
5,Nice Change,"Nice change from regular stretch routines. Somewhat like dynamic stretching. Definitely get value for your dollar. There is narration throughout. It is pretty harmless and sometimes helpful. If you prefer silence, mute and watch."
2,Breast more important than content...,"I keep trying to like this DVD, but the corny comments and the constant view of Stephanie making sure her ""fake and purchased"" breast are seen by the world distract from a good workout. By no means am I a prude or someone that doesn't appreciate the human body, but this is ridiculous. Her nipples are almost hanging out. I just don't understand why this was encouraged or even tolerated by anyone editing or directing the workout."
2,"It's supposed to be a workout video, not a porn flick, put some clothes on",I am so sick of buying exercise videos and being confronted with scantily clad instructors. Cover yourself up for goodness sake - I don't care to look down your top when you bend over to demonstrate a pose!!! The voice of the woman leading the workout grated on my nerves and her manner seemed forced or insincere. I think the moves would have actually been nice had I been able to stand to watch or listen to it. I'd like to find a similar workout with a different instructor - preferably one who is appropriately dressed.
5,A good intro to Ronnefeld,"The composer was featured at the 2003 Risr chamber music festival, my introduction to him. The pieces I heard there were all compelling, some hair-raising. Ronnefeld's music is dramatic and captivating. I have listened to my disk half a dozen times and now look forward to hearing it. It is powerful stuff, fresh to the ear, and in its way beautiful. Ronnefeld knows how to speak to the ear and the heart. The performers are excellent, and they all give committed performances which seem to me to give Ronnefeld the hearing he deserves."
5,Great Undaground Hip Hop LP... Kool Keith at his best,This is Kool Keith's best record since Dr. Dooom. Motion Man blows away Menelick. Get this joint!
4,There is hope,"I gave up on Keith and then... I picked up this album. I had the ""Partners Confused"" 12"" and was impressed, but by the time this dropped I already moved on. Later on I picked this CD up on a whim and was given hope for Kool Keith.Kutmaster Kurt takes up the production and brings his signature sound of hard drums and stabbing samples. No doubt the beats bang on this joint and Keith and Motion Man flow so naturaly over the tracks. A very solid listen and a breath of hope for the Keith fans that thought his only moment of greatness was Doc Oc and Ultra."
5,Instant Underground Classic,"A well produced album by KutMasta Kurt. The best Kool Keith album yet, and I have all of them including the Ultramagnetic MC's and all the other aliases he goes by. Motion Man compliments him well on this album. They're the true ""Dynamic Duo"". After hearing this album you will climax!!!"
5,Luv 'em!,"If you are lucky enough to enjoy the unique tartness of Gooseberries, ""Oregon"" through Amazon may be the only source for them, and I'm grateful. They don't seem to be available in grocery stores like they were in my youth, so thanks for e-commerce. I tried a pie made from wild gooseberries but it didn't compare to these Oregon's that my mom always used. For an added treat, make a pie with 1/3 each gooseberries, rhubarb, and red raspberries. Please keep these available always."
5,YUMMY,"Great berries, so easy and make great pies! I got three very full pies out of the eightcans. Too bad for the kids they don't like gooseberries. ha ha"
4,almost like home,"I grew up in central Il with tons of gooseberry bushes. I had no idea they didn't just grow everywhere until my husband joined the navy. Canned gooseberries can be a nasty experience. I had pretty much given up on the idea of a good gooseberry pie, short of having to visit my childhood home and steel a bag, until I found the Oregon fruit can of gooseberries. I love their cherries and decided to give the gooseberries a try. They were so good, and my pies are now back to fabulous!"
4,"Tart , delicious Gooseberries","Here in MA , Gooseberries are a rare find,hence the canned Gooseberries are the option ...this grape-like flavor is tart and unique. The recipes included called for 2 cans of Oregon Gooseberries for one pie..I found 1 can fills the pie shell(with the juice thickened)and works well. The juice is very sweetened ..taste first."
2,keep this quiet,"Gooseberry's are the food of the God's, (only the discriminating ones) In the out season, (most of the time), You are a rare source. There are not enough to meet the supply if this gets out. Quit advertising.Gooseberry Pie Filling, Sugar Free, 32 fl. Oz."
5,great quality,"I bought this actually for camping so I can make french press coffee. I use it all the time at home now and absolutley love it. It is pure quality constructed all stainless steel. At first I thought it was a little pricey but after receiving it and using it, it is worth every dollar I paid."
5,ESL Smart Ready-To-Use Life Skills & Academic Activities for Grades K - 8,As an ESL teacher I have found this book invaluable. I have used it regularly in my classroom practices as it caters for all students including those who are new arrivals with limited English skills through to those who are mastering written English with all its nuances.
5,Very Useful!,I found this book very useful. I teach a muli-level ESL class to adults and I use this book for all levels. This book is better than most out there.
5,Should be huge!,"This album has had a lukewarm reception and I can't understand why! It is one of those albums that the more you listen to it the more you love it. Just put it on, lie down and listen to the lyrics you'll be amazed at how many chords it strikes in your mind. For anyone that has gone through a break up you'll be touched by the simplicity of the emotions and little everyday situations described by Gabrielle in the songs.Stand out Tracks ""Play to Win"" ""Fallen Angel"" and ""Picking Up The Pieces"""
2,some tracks should have stayed in the vaults,"This is not an album I`d recommend as a first Horslips album. It`s a compilation but not a `best of`. It comprises tracks that were originally released as vinyl singles, including different sounding versions of tracks that are already to be found on other albums, e.g., Dearg Doom(The Tain), King of the Fairies(Dancehall Sweethearts), and a version of Daybreak that sounds nothing like the(superior) album version(on Book of Invasions). This is more an album for the Horslips fan `completist`, although there are a few nice tracks (completely unique to this album) that would be of interest to a new fan too, such as, Johnny`s Wedding, Green Gravel, Oisin`s Tune, High Reel, Fairy King. The two tracks, Fab Four-Four and Come Back Beatles, released under the band name `Lipstick`, should never have been recorded, let alone included on a Horslips album!"
4,"A good, thought provoking read","This is the first book I've read of Robert Sawyers's and I'll be reading many more. If you like an Science Fiction author that does rigorous research into an interesting topic, packages ideas from that research into an original, entertaining and thought provoking story, then includes references at the end of the book should you want to explore more, then you'll enjoy this book. For the last third of the book I couldn't put the book down. Highly recommended."
4,A positive book about life and computer uploads.,"The first book I had ever read by Sawyer, Mindscan, the title, says it all.The science of scanning and uploading a mind into a computer is discoveredbut not perfected. The book deals with the concept of syntheticintelligences running through computer systems, and a murderer on theloose. Won't give any more away, but it's a very good offering by thisCanadian Science Fiction writer."
4,A Novel of Ideas - finally,"I've been missing Asimov and his writing. Like Asimov Sawyer moves his plot by what is needed for the exposition of ideas, rather than from cliffhanging explosion to cliffhanger. It is a different kind of read, and a very interesting one. I'm happy to have found him & intend to seek his other novels as well.The idea in this book is this: what is it in each of us that makes us us - that constitutes our individual humanity? Imagine that we can duplicate our consciousness onto a computer chip that can then think like us, be us, in fact. Put the chip in a body based on ours and what have we got? Personal immortality, clone, thinking machine? The issues are thrashed out in a variety of ways - being a lawyer I liked the trial the best of course.Highly recommended. Why not 5 stars? He's not quite up to Asimov's level in turning ideas into action, but he'll certainly keep me reading until someone comes along who is."
3,Good story line but weakens as it goes on,"Just finished the book . I like Sawyers story ideas, but it starts to get preachy when he tries to bring his political views in the story. It was a good story line about what is human, but it starts becoming a bit trite as the story drags. This could be the author's style as it also occurred in Rollback. That is why I give it three stars."
3,Implausibilities,"The story is entertaining but, in my opinion, marred by some highly implausible premises. A fatal flaw in the tale is the idea that the originals would cede personhood to the copies and agree to a permanent incommunicado Wall E-like exile, on the moon of all places, without any remedies if they change their mind. (By the way, in 2045, aren't there less expensive destinations on earth away from the jurisdictions of the U.S. and Canada? This felt like a gratuitous detail perhaps added to make the story more ""science-fictiony"".) I also find the legal strategy of simply assuming transfer of personhood to the copy once the original is ""disappeared"" to be absurd - there must be many better ways of providing a living for both the original and the copy here on earth, without the laughable banishment strategy."
2,Very Disappointed,"I have read a few of Sawyer's books before (Calculating God and the first two of Quintaglio series) and the back cover represented and interesting story. The content of a trial seemed weak and avoided crtical questions. I found the main characters shallow, selfish and conceited at every page. Even the main premise is a stretch - Who would every agree to upload and just go off somewhere to die? How can machines be aroused enough for intimate relations? The anti-U.S. and anti-religion stance from every major character was very repetitve (once is sufficient) that it became painful to complete the book. The ending was very anti-climatic. I'm going to read the last of the Qunitaglio series because I want to finish the series and then I'm moving to more interesting authors. Perhaps I'll come back for another another book someday."
2,If this is a meaty review of the topic compared to his other books...,"then I will skip the other books. The book was an enjoyable read if a bit heavyhanded with the politics but was overall very superficial. I expected more from an author who has received so many awards. There were several plot flaws as well as massive amounts of typos. His editor did a lousy job of correcting spelling errors and grammar.If you want a quick, easy, enjoyable read this is your book but if you are looking for an in depth look at what it means to be human; keep looking, you won't find it here."
3,Interesting read,"This book is a good read. It presented some thought provoking concepts and ideas that give rise to dilemas that don't happen in real life. At least not yet.I felt that the story was heavy on moral and political implications. This is good but not exactly what makes me want to read a science fiction novel.The synopsis on the back of the book grabbed my attention because of its similarity to a few of Greg Egan books (Permutation City and Diaspora). I was expecting more of this; so I was a little disappointed in that the science aspects, in my opinion, took a back seat to the moral and polictical drama."
1,Very slow and dissapointing,"Yet another novel written about the field of the author, full of boring and self indulging insites into the world of academia. Pretentiously written - how many words can he fit in one sentence? I've read almost all of Parks work, including the excellent Cara Massimina and the pathetic Shear, and this is by far the worst. Don't waste your money."
2,"Too much pontification, not enough surprises...","Erudite musings on cultural matters are all very well in small doses, but a novel to my mind needs to show you something extraordinary if it's to be worthwhile. And that means some kind of surprise, something unexpected. This story ambles along quite amiably, and is written in a commendably plain, unassuming way. But as as story it never takes off. I guess good, original stories are just very hard to come by..."
2,I don't think I read the same book as the rest of you!,"Sorry folks, I agree with David Gates. An interesting idea but sloppy writing with an author in pretentious mode often more interested in showing his own ""intelligence"" than in constructing a fluid or challenging narrative. I felt like joining Vikram and was delighted to finish this book! Only buy it if you are prepared to wade through some pretty turgid stuff."
1,suffocating,"Interior monologue; no dialogue; paras pages long; sentences of two or three hundred words; a depressing, turgid read. Reading Tim Parks' fiction is a bit like being buttonholed by an inebriated guy in a bar who wants to tell you for ten or twelve hours about what a bitch the woman in his life is.Enjoyable only to those who think that reading is supposed to be an unpleasant experience, to be endured rather than enjoyed.Hard to believe this is the same author who wrote those delightful Italian books."
3,Biased,"Ok, I am biased. Scoot was my moms dog- purchased only because I had gotten married and moved out of the house and took my dalmatian with me. Her name was Ansel, she passed away just a few months ago (3/2012). We all had fun making the movie that summer and she got great training from a top notch trainer for free. But most importantly she and the other dogs got to know each other AND since the movie was shot at the local humane society and ASPCA they got free press. Additionally, the last scene was a fund raiser for the humane society.The movie itself, well I now have kids, and it is definitely a kid movie. Somedays I think it is worse than others. Today it was a good day- kids asked for it AND it held their attention. Other days, not so much.Again, I am biased because now that Ansel has passed we have this great memento. Even my dog Hopkins appears at the end during the fair."
3,Definitely a Pre-school movie,"The reviewer, Michael, must have judged these movies by adult standards. However, these are good movies for the pre-school set. They are great when Mommy has to fix dinner and wants the tiny ones out of her hair! It probably should be five stars for pre-schoolers; I gave it three because parents would find it to be a quite slow and juvenile story if they wish to watch them with the toddlers!"
1,A REAL DOG OF A MOVIE,"Part of a two disc collection, this one is really a dog! It's as though a local little theater group got together and decided to film a movie, perhaps given the money by a local millionaire. The results are pretty tepid; even kids will find this one a howler. With a script that seems written by a pink slipped author, PAWS AND CLAWS tries to make up for its human inadequacies by giving the animals ""thought"" dialogue, but even the cuteness of the critters can't save this one. The ""Let's Save the Animal Shelter"" plotline is so shoddily concocted, one can only hope the shelter shuts down and all the animals are let loose. I'm usually a sucker for cute animal movies, but PAWS AND CLAWS RESCUERS is just a big mess."
1,Unfortunate Title,"The title of this book alone should dissuade all readers from reading this book. Every serious scholar of the Lewis and Clark Expedition can tell you that Sacagawea was never the guide on the journey, that the accepted spelling of her name is Sacagawea, not Sacajawea, and that there were other interpreters in the Corps of Discovery besides Sacagawea."
3,Fragile Bunny,"I bought two of these because they were on sale. Both arrived with the boxes opened and one of the rabbits' head had come off in the package. It's also not as big as I thought it would be. It's maybe 6 inches tall, mostly because of the ears, and only about an inch thick. It does have an opening hatch on the back which is neat, but don't get this, as I did, under the illusion that, because it has a pull string, it would be good for a kid to play with. It's much to small and fragile."
3,The ear was broken when we received i.,"The wood on this was very flimsy as we had received it with an ear broken. The wood seemed to be pretty cheap, so be careful with it."
4,Scooby Doo Pirates,Another cool DVD from SCOOBY DOO and friends! Kids just love it and it keeps them occupied for quite awhile. Gives parents time to clean the house!
1,Deceitful,"I fell prey to this DVD in the store, when my young son saw it and said ""YO HO"" I simply looked at the cover and OK'd it (never again). The cover makes it look like a movie, but it's just 3 episodes. Episodes that are on other Scooby Doo DVD sets (That we already own) at that. Also, it should have been titled ""Ghosts"" and not ""Pirates"", All 3 of the episode are about Ghosts, and the first episode doesn't even take place on sea or boat, let alone have pirates in it. I am very displeased with this deliberately misleading, lack of pirate Scooby Doo ""video""."
2,Disappointing read,"Having read 2 other Brad Thor books featuring the Scot Horvath character and thoroughly enjoying them I was looking forward to Blowback. I must say I was greatly disappointed. The plot could have been interesting, but got far too bogged down and complicated, and sometimes lost in the author's attempt to educate readers on the real life history behind the plot. Add to that the constant ""Mission Impossible"" escapes from certain death by the protagonist that would have left Clive Cussler shaking his head, I found myself anxious for the book to end. I will give Brad Thor another try I am sure, but can't recommend this as a must read to anyone."
2,"Characters with no soul, a plot with no belief","Gee, another one-dimensional superspy who effortlessly moves from country to country while easily finding bad guys that no one else can find. Oh, and all the bad guys are ruthless, sadistic, torturing terrorists, but the only thing our hero can think of doing when he captures them is to smack them around a little. Good thing the plot defies all credibility, with a little race-against-time-to-save-the-world thrown in just to be generic."
5,great read,This is an exceptionally good read. I could not put this book down. I highly recommend this to all.
3,Kind of tedious and unbelievable,"It was okay. I've read the previous books in the series, but I'm taking a Scot Harvath break for a little while. It's an okay read if you like a LOT of science and history (which I usually do, but come on!) mixed in with your political thriller. Although I found a lot less thriller and more detective work in this one."
3,Right Out of the Headlines,Blowback certainly deals with current issues--the Middle East political caldrone. It was like Dirk Pitt solves the DaVinci Code--a hero who can do everything and a lot of historical information. It just lacks real depth--but maybe that wasn't the intent.
5,better than tom clancy,The first book i ready by Brad Thor was takedown. It was good but not 5 stars. Then i just read blowback & this was a very good book from beginning to end. The storyline and the characters were very good. I like action & spy novels & after reading blowback i'm going to read more Thor books. The story takes you all over the world and it was hard to put down.
4,"A fast, fun read.","Blowback is a great book for an airplane, which is where I picked it up. Thor is good at drawing pictures for you, which makes for a very engaging read. It also went fast, and was really addictive. This is one of the first books in this genre I've read, and it reminded me of the TV series 24, which I love. A great summer read, too!"
2,Scattered and almost silly,"I have enjoyed Thor's other books, Lions of Lucerne and State of Union but this was not up to that level in storyline or realism. I looked forward to finishing it so I could begin another book. It was at times a burden to pick up. But I will give Thor another chance, I have Takedown to read and I am optimistic it will be better."
4,fantastic!,"Brad Thor scores again with Blowback, a whipcrack thriller that tackles religious fanaticism and international terrorism with verve and style to spare. His protagonist, Scot Horvath, has been sent out to pasture by a meddling politician, but soon is brought back into the fold to take on a villain with a taste for biological weaponry. Alarmingly prescient and well-researched, it delivers the goods. Definitely check out James Macomber's A Grave Breach if you enjoyed this one."
4,Blowback book by Brad Thor,Rec'd book in good shape and in a timely fashion. I love the Brad Thor novels and have read all but one and am looking forward to more of them. Thanks
4,Blow Back,Nicely written thriller that continues Brad Thor's serial. If you like a good mystery/thriller then you need to look into this series.
5,Wow. It's a winner,"Read this book over the Christmas, New Year break. Didn't want to put it down. I feel spoiled by the writing of Dan Brown after reading The Davinci Code, but this was as enjoyable. Look forward to his next book, Takedown."
3,Over the top,This is the second Brad Thor book I've read and while I enjoy his main character this story is a little over the top. The amazing string of improbable situations pushes beyond thriller into more of a comic book feeling.
1,Clause After Clause; Cliche After Cliche,"I am an ardent reader of mysteries, thrillers, etc., so much so that I am running out of authors such as Child, Nesbo, Ludlum, Crais, Box, Grisham, Larrson, De Mille. At any rate, I kept seeing books by Brad Thor and by-passing them. However, in a moment of desperation, I noticed that Blowback was advertised as being on NPR's top 100 thriller list. Well, needless to say, I won't be reading NPR recommendations any more. It was so poorly written that I could barely stomach getting through it. I had trouble skimming pages to get to readable text. Yes, the Hannibal and Islamist history is interesting enough to keep parts of this book going, but do yourself a favor and read the actual history and by-pass this really weak novel.In closing, it took a book like this to prompt a long time Amazon reader like me to write my first ever Amazon review."
4,Great Book,Brad Thor did it again. Scott Harvarth takes a licking and goes on ticking. Suspensuful throughout from front to back.
2,Ripped off!,"Why is it that Brad Thor..or his people, thought it was ok to reissue this book, promote it and generally make it look like it was new?I read this when it first came out 6 years ago, but here it is again on the book shelves like it is a new release. I was one chapter into it when I thought, either he is doing something taken from another story or...... when I checked the publisher information in the front, I almost threw the book across the room! It just cost me $10+ for a recovered version of what I already own!You should be ashamed!"
3,meh....,"This is the traditional prose composition text. This is how my professors learned, and how their professors learned, and their professors learned, etc. That's fine, but it doesn't mean this is the best prose comp text. Today's American student has to translate Sidgwick's 19th cent English into modern English before even attempting to translate anything into Greek. The ""notes"" are poorly organized and difficult to understand, the grammar terms are outdated, and frequently it is more frustrating to understand Sidgwick's own prose than any of the Greek. What are very useful, however, are his tables of particles and prepositions at the end, as well as the English-Greek glossary."
5,"Definitive, if Rough Sledding for Novices","Wow. Simply, wow. I have spent many years waiting for someone to write a book on this topic.You can turn over any rock and find a book on Greek mythology, but books about the actual practice of ancient Hellenic religion are not easily found. Finally, Robert Parker fills the gap.I will warn you that the book seems to have been written primarily for Classics scholars. If you know little or no ancient Greek history and mythology, Parker will not slow down to explain these topics to you. Similarly, it will really help if you can read a little Greek.But if you can keep up with it, this book is incredibly rewarding."
4,stainless steel pot,"I bought this rice cooker because of the stainless steel pot. Learning about the dangers of non stick coatings and alum. pots made me invest in this product. I have no big complaints. I do wish it were a larger size (large family) Cooks rice well- if you spray the pot with PAM type product in the bottom. If not, it will stick. Overall it is a good purchase."
2,Be prepared to lose a bunch of rice,"Like basically everyone else, I bought this rice cooker to replace an old one, whose non-stick coating was starting to flake. The idea of a stainless steel bowl really appealed to me, but the reality of it is that you're going to lose a lot of rice when cooking a batch.There are a few recommendations for reducing the effect of this, the most helpful being to coat the bowl with oil (I haven't tried a cooking spray yet) prior to adding rice and water, but it won't completely solve the problem and it also affects the taste of the rice.Soaking the bowl overnight does allow for easy cleaning, but it's still a bummer to have a substantial layer of rice go down the sink (or, if you don't have garbage disposal, to be fished out of the strainer and into the trash).This might just be the trade off, for being able to avoid aluminum or non-stick coating, but be prepared for it."
3,Ricer,Easy to clean. Rice taste great. No metal taste like aluminium pots. Tends to overboil the pot. Have to watch carefully or can create a rice crust on bottom.
2,Rice Cooker,"Have used it many times, but still can't seem to get a decent rice - usually comes out sticky or not quite done. Does not seem to be any consistency, and for sure can't walk away from it, which is what I had hoped it would allow me to do."
4,Satisfied with purchase,"I have been looking like the rest of you for a rice cooker/steamer and money wasn't my first criteria - stainless steel was.,In cooking with the Miracle Rice Steamer here is what I found. I used 3 cups of white rice (used measuring cup provided), water to the mark between 2 and 4 in the stainless steel bowl plus a small amount of olive oil then turned it on. The way this unit is advertised one would assume the unit has a sensor knowing when to shut-off to warm mode. I didn't find that to be true with my test. After 50 mins. of cook time I manually pulled the plug and let it set for 5 mins. I also took the included plastic spoon/spatula and stirred the rice once while cooking. There was no sticking as others have stated in their review. The rice tasted wonderful and and cleaning was a snap with NO soaking whatsoever.Bottom line, I will keep the steamer as it does do what I want despite the lack of automatic timing and no shut-off feature."
4,good product,This rice cooker works very well. There is no boil over with 2 cups of dry rice. It automatically switches to warm when the cooking is done. There is only minor sticking to the bottom of the stainless pot.
5,Entertaining dinosour book!,"We checked this book out at the library, then ended up buying it because my 2 year and 4 year olds really loved it. Colorful illustrations! The story keeps their attention throughout the entire book. Great book for your little dinosour lovers."
5,The best judo book,Every judoka who practise not only sports but art and self-defence need it. Only a few techniques of this book are known now in judo. And there are 160 tricks there! And it's real! I'm sure because I train it every day. Try it.
1,not made in U.S.A. - wrong picture,The cutter pictured is not what is being sold. The actual cutter is a smaller red piece that is made in Taiwan. Amazon is great but I get tired of wondering what will show up in the mail when I order tools here.
4,Great Family Book,"This was a very good book. It tells an everday story of a large family. I think it really tells about the problems a kid might have, and discusses what you should do in a situation like the one. A very important part in this story is when a younger brother dies in a car wreck. It tells that it is okay not to cry. That sometimes people just don't cry when they are sad. I think that this is a good book for anyone above the age of 9."
5,The best book ever!,"At first when I saw it, it didn't look interesting. But, once I kept reading I fell in love with it. It's such a great book that makes you want to laugh, and also cry. I think I can relate to the oldest Cliff a lot. It's just such a great book for all of the family. If there was such thing as six stars(or more) I'd give it that."
5,a touching sad but happy book that gave me tears,"When Brad dies I thought the family would never cheer up, but they do when Josh accidentally steps in the fig pudding. There are many funny parts like when he stuffs cloths and ripped underware into his fishing set."
5,Fig Pudding was the best book I've ever read!!,It's about a boy named Clifford who likes adventures. Some sad things also happen in this book and some funny things happen. It's a wonderful book for all ages that can handle it. I read it when I was 8 years old
3,Extra Extra Extra,"I liked the book because somtimes it was suspenseful, and that was what kept me going. The book is the same as The War With Grandpa. The only part changed was that he had a war with his mom."
4,Ians review Fig Pudding,"I thought this book was hilarious because the little kid Brad Kills himself ridin his bike into a parked ambulance. But I didnt like the way the author wants you to think about the book, he wants you to be like sad for the little kid. Also he didnt use very descriptive words. Like he doesnt describe the characters enough. out of five, I give it a four."
2,Dry book about an interesting subject...,"I read Marcie Hershman's book to give me insight on grief and mourning. Although the topic of voice is intriguing & often neglected, I found the writing to be very dry and difficult to read. The book is brief (100 pages) but for me, I found it hard be propelled forward with detailed descriptions of metaphysical topics. It was excrutiatingly dull for me to complete this short book."
5,Good for the price,Good stopwatch for the price. Easy to use and durable in the 1 month we have used it. Eleven year old Daughter likes the style and color.
1,Beware: broke after a couple months/warranty expired.,"Use caution when ordering these. It was nice enough when it worked, but mine stopped working after a few months. When I opened it up to see if I could just replace the battery, the components inside were very rusty.It has an advertised 1 year free warranty service. However, the dates that the warranty is valid for is printed on the back of the stopwatch. The back of min said the 1 year free warranty period expired Dec. 2010. I ordered the watch directly from amazon in November of 2011. Amazon is clearly selling old stock on these. Selling a product that is out of its warranty period before it reaches you seems very unethical. You can still get warrant service for a fee, however, the fee is $10. When you add in postage and consider that the cost of these new is around $8 on amazon, you realize the warranty isn't worth anything on this watch. Unless you are inside the amazon return period, if it is broken, you are out of luck on this stopwatch."
2,not what I expected...,"...but it is what I should have expected. It does what it says it will do but it's just a digital watch in a large enough package to hold in your hand. The numbers are not any bigger than a digital watch for your arm and you have to go through the same, sometimes unclear ""modes"" to get to stop watch, then push multiple buttons at the same time to reset. Like I said, it's a digital watch in stopwatch package.If your expecting a ""stop watch"" with simple start, lap, and reset buttons and large easy to read numbers pass on this one. If you are ok with what it actually is, then its not a bad deal."
5,Works great,Use this to time myself when swimming laps. It is easy to located due to vibrant color and has so far been waterproof Iike the sellers says.
2,A cheap stopwatch that is (surprise!) cheap.,"I purchased 3 of these watches because the reviews were reasonable and the price was very attractive. One watch was dead on arrival, but my recollection is the mfr did send me new batteries, which I appreciated. One of the watches has since come apart and the only way to hold it together is with tape--though it still functions. The split button on one of the other watches has become very hard to activate--required a strong push, not just a quick click--competely unacceptable for more than a couple lap splits. I only use these watches about 4 times per year, and decided I simply cannot rely on these things to perform when I need them to. Time to try a different brand and spend a bit more on something with a tad more quality in construction. Also wish there was an on-off switch to save on battery life."
2,kind of crappy,"I had for a few days. Eventually tossed it and got another (duplicate of what I already had). Might work for someone else, but wasn't very intuitive for me and instructions were so so. Total crap--no. But didn't last with me."
2,Battery dead in 5 months,"Bought these for our sports team on December 6. Five months later the batteries are dead even though it is advertised with a 1.5 year battery life. Looks like they were manufactured in 2009. There is no tab to pull out to start the battery running the watch so it is running before you receive it. They take an LR43 Maxell battery and you have to remove 5 tiny screws to change the battery. I wouldn't buy it again. It does work properly, though, until it dies."
5,great value,"I ordered several of this type in various colors to assist us at work. They are used a few hours each day 5-6 days per week. They have been working great, easy to follow functions and the display is easy to read and very visible. Highly recommend."
1,battery died,"Bought this stopwatch in December, was dead by March. Worked out of package just fine, looked good. When I took it out to use it for the first time, the battery was already dead. My wife uses a stopwatch for work, has gone through 2 in 15 years. This one lasted a couple of months. Stay away!"
4,Good stopwatch for price,Good stopwatch for the price. Activating and deactivating the alarm and setting the date/time can be a little tricky.
4,kamahl with dreadlocks...oh yeah!,Once again J. Robert King out does himself. This book was an excellent sequel to Onslaught and I can't wait for the next one! King's characters fuse together through random chance in a world overrun by powerhungry would be dictatorsip in such a perfect way that his writing style can be described as nothing less than beautiful.
4,great fit.,this product fit perfect into my 2000 mazda 626.the specs for the product are a little off its actually7.2 inches wide5.0 inches talli am very pleased with the overall look and the service provided.
3,Is there a need,Took this product to my MD for review. He questioned the need takes such a product if no problems exist. I decided my health was just fine without the product.
5,Love this product,Only fish oil that does not upset my stomach. I am very happy with this product and have it as a subscription
2,Faulty Advertisement,"The product description says that it has 193 pigs so I ordered three sets, but when it came I was extremely disappointed because only three little pigs came. This is really disappointing, and I have to spend more money, but definitely not money on a company that does not advertise properly."
2,"Should have been called ""Recycled""","This is a second rehashing of greatest hit material from New Order which I'm sorry to say, is a combination of 1987's ""Substance"" and 1995's ""Best of"" with a sprinkle of ""Get Ready"" era singles. There is nothing here to be excited about if you have these singles already since you can pretty much compile a decent facsimile of ""International"" through a CD burner. At least they should have included the almost rare original Arthur Baker version of ""Confusion"" instead of the one included in ""Substance"". I got the cheaper Australian import, so I didn't get the French bonus disk with rarities, but that doesn't look too impressive. I heard that every country would get an ""International"" with different track listings, but I don't see any diffences between the French and Australian versions. In any case, you're going to buy the bulk of the singles when the ""Retro"" box set comes out, so skip this one and save up for that."
4,"""Album Description"" is wrong","The Album Description above says the version of ""Temptation"" on this album is the original 1982 version; this is incorrect - it is the 1987 ""Substance"" version. If you want the original, at this point it looks like you still have to dig up the original singles. However, the ""Retro"" box set has a medium-length version of it (both longer than the original 7"" but shorter than the original 12""). While not EXACTLY ""the"" 1982 version (or rather, one of the two released 1982 versions), it is from that era, and does capture the 1982 vers.' more raw sound with rather tinny electronic percussion (I actually prefer it to the slicker though also rather dated 1987 remade version on Substance.)"
3,Rock and rollers,"There is some very good music here . I had to make a best of for myself , there is too much Zappa-Cooper jazzy nonsense for my taste . I remembered just the best songs anyway . Get a best of and be merry ..."
5,"Don't just stand there, pray something.",The is by far the best book I have read on intercessory prayer. I also read 2 of Dutch Sheet's. But this book is straight to the point and practical. I am glad and feel blessed to have found it. Only God Himself could have led me to find this wonderful book and all praise be to Him. I highly recommend this book to anyone praying for the redemption and deliverance of a loved one.
5,"Still reading, but.....","This book has been so helpful to my prayer life. It has broadened my understanding, deepened my respect, and aided in the fruitfulness of my prayer life. I believe prayer is foundational to our relationship with the body of Christ and Jesus as our Lord. Reading this book has been like spending time with a wise elder who desires to assist the walk of fellow brothers and sisters. I can't recommend this book highly enough. God bless."
5,A Great Addition,"After taking the time to get serious with garage band, I quickly found the need to get more instument voices for my uses. I play the music into garage band (record) with a M-Audio 66ES keystation (which I highly recommend) and found that there just weren't enough instruments to meet my needs for all of the tracks that I like to record. This product more than meets those needs, as it has a ton of instruments to use. I especially like how much more realistic they sound than the pre-loaded instruments in the original garage band. If you are more into using the loops, they are spectacular! They would work well as soundtracks for movies or slideshows, or as accompaniments to anything you want. This product is well worth the money and I don't feel as if I need to get any of the other Jam Packs. But that's just me........"
5,How to Buy,"I rushed out and bought this when I heard it was discontinued. It's my only Jam Pack, and I'm a light user of Garageband.Apparently the best way to get this now, as well as all the other Jam Packs, is to buy Logic Pro 9. The complete package is the same price as two Jam Packs used to be. No wonder they were discontinued!"
5,The awesomeness that is Apple Garageband Jam Pack: Symphony Orchestra. Kick ass!,I love Apple products and this one sure did live up to my expectations. The product was in great condition and arrived at the estimated delivery date. Thanks for everything.
5,Excellent,Deff if you are looking for good samples and soundbanks you need this JamPack. Nice orchestra instruments!
3,Good for a first novel.,I enjoyed the book but thought there was a lot of technical stuff that was sometimes hard to get through. Really makes you think about what really goes on behind the closed doors of the Bush administration. Especially Cheney's closed door.
4,A fun look at the one cosmetic I can't do without.,"I thought this book was insightful, full of facts and wisdom. It's written well and contains everything you ever wanted to know and more. There are tons of quotes from famous make up artists and tips for creating your own colors. And my favorite - a look at the shapes of our lipstick and what it says about us. I loved the wittiness of it.On a separate note. The previous reviewer was questioning the author's credibility since she wasn't wearing any lipstick in her photograph. The photo is in black and white and perhaps the color (especially if it was a light one) she was wearing didn't come out. This is trivial. The review should be about the content of the book."
5,Great Mothers Day gift!,"Bought this for my mother-in-law last year and it was a big hit. This year its going to my own mom! There are a lot of lipstick addicts out there, and this book is unique blend of scholarship, humor, and pop culture. A recommend."
4,Lipstick on Your Collar,"""Lipstick"" a punchy, wild ride into the past, present and future of the color stick so many of us hold sacred. Careful research, personal anecdotes, laugh out loud humor and more, keep the eye moving and the page turning. I kicked back, put my feet up, and spent a few hours entering the lipstick zone. What fun. Great gift, with a tube or two of the colorful stuff, for that special someone."
3,My friend Sarah has this book.,"My friend Sarah got this book as a gift from her Aunt Wendy, who also likes to send books about serial killers, and pictures of other people's dead cats. I flipped through it when I was staying at her house in Baltimore a few month's ago. I really like Baltimore.The book seemed good, but not as good as the one Aunt Wendy sent about vampires."
5,If you love lipstick...,"You'll love this book! It's loaded with information--everything you could ever want to know about lipstick you'll find here; even how to make your own. It's well written and assumes the reader is intelligent with a sense of humour, mostly text, which is refreshing for a book about a cosmetic. This is not a magazine-type-picture-book for morons--it's a book for adults with a whimsical nature. Jessica Pallingston is the Professor of Lipstick!"
1,Still waiting,"After 3 days on the telephone and being bounced back and forth between NEW and the manufacturer, NEW finally agreed to abide by the terms of the warranty and refund my money. However, that was last week, and I am still waiting for the return label which was supposed to arrive that afternoon by e-mail. I'm wondering if they are stalling since we are close to the expiration date of the warranty!"
5,George Kirby - That's Entertainment,"I'll make it short & sweet. If you want to see what comedians were like when they were first and foremost ""entertainers"", this is for you. Jokes, one-liners, stories, impressions, songs, dances, he does 'em all - and leaves you with a smile. Be transported to the 50's, 60's and 70's - a classier, happier form of comedy! George Kirby was a masterful ""big room"" cabaret entertainer. He is missed.Tommy Moore"
5,Best toy ever...,I don't know what those other two ladies are talking about but I purchased this toy for my daughter and she absolutely loved it and still loves it. The accessories are fantastic and the fact that she can grow is something my daughter still can't get over. She is 5 and I would say it's a perfect gift for Christmas for any girl 5 and up.
1,Suzie Doesn't Work Doll,"My daughter begged for this doll, and when we finally got her she asked for so many different things all at once..it was hard to understand what to do next ""okay, now a bottle, okay now she wants a hug, okay now she wants this"" then she grew...and stopped working. She wouldn't speak or move or do anything. We, like other reviewers, did the same thing..checked the reset switch (which is really difficult to get to with all the clothes on) we changed the batteries...nothing.We paid nearly $100 for her in the stores..and she was a huge waste. My daughter cried when I made her give her up to take back to the store.Was not pleased. I'd rate her zero if I could."
1,Think twice before buying this toy,"My daughter got this toy for her 6 years birthday gift. She played nicely with it two hours and then the toy died. No sound, no movements. Birthday party was ruined."
2,Would not buy this again,"My daughter asked Santa for this doll and since he didn't want to disappoint her she found it under the tree Christmas morning. She enjoyed playing with it that day but in the four months since Christmas this doll has only been played with a handful of times.She comes with lots of accessories which my daughter enjoyed. She also liked the way the doll ""talked"" and interacted with her but the novelty wore off quickly. We found that her clothes fit very snug so they are hard for my 4 yr old to get on and off. Personally I think it is a little creepy the way the doll ""grows"". When she is in her ""toddler phase"" she looks quite odd with an elongated torso.I am just waiting for my daughter to completely forget about this doll so we can give it away.Overall, I thought this doll was a waste of money. Go with ""Bitty Baby"" instead- that's a quality doll that will provide years of imaginative play."
1,Christmas crash,"This doll prompted quite an emotional roller coaster. It worked beautifully for a few hours on Christmas morning. Just long enough for my daughter to fall in love and declare it the best toy ever. Then Suzie just went silent. We changed the batteries, we used the reset button. Nothing. It was just dead. The only instructions they sent were in French, but I was able to decipher them. Nothing explained the crash and the few troubleshooting suggestions did nothing but give us a few minutes of false hope. I'll post a revision if the company is helpful to us when I try to contact them tomorrow. Ugh. What a holiday let-down for a little girl."
4,2nd try,"I ordered this for my daughter who had been wanting it for Christmas, but I wasn't willing to shell out the $100 for her. When the price went down, we ordered her. We got her out of the box and put in the batteries, and she worked until she grew, then the mysterious shut down that others experienced. I contacted customer service who sent a replacement out the next day. Before the replacement arrived, I was able to fiddle with the first one and somehow the glitch went away, and she began working. When the replacement got here, she worked without any problems, and the first one went back. Amazon's policy and procedure on this was exceptionally easy and hassle free. She gets 4 stars because of the first glitch and because some of the color on her lips does wear off when she is ""fed"" with her spoons & bottle. Overall, I am pleased and my 5 yo daughter is thrilled."
3,Granddaughter Loves It!,"My granddaughter loves the doll I got her for Xmas. I, however, find it somewhat lacking. It is heavy, bulky and tends to need to be reset after 'sleeping'. She dosen't respond to commands as well as advertised and some commands she dosen't recognize at all (Suzie, do you want to play pattycake?)"
3,Overrated Suzie,"While this is a very cute doll, my 8-year-old granddaughter became quickly bored with it...glad I caught it on sale and didn't pay full price!"
5,baby love and grow,This doll is really great. I have 4 daughters ages 5 and under. They all love it. The best part is that it has not broken and they can really be ruff on things.
3,Bonde Suzie,"We rcvd the items very quickly and just love the doll. My daughter, Taylor is 7 yrs old and almost out of paying with babies but she really loves Suzie. Great gift item!!"
4,Loads of fun,This is such a sweet toy for any little girl - she actually grows ands when you shut her off she shrinks again. its really cool. kinda wish it didnt happen so fast - kind hassle to keep dressing and undressing - very cute though
2,Suzie didn't last!,"I give this doll 2 stars because at least she was very well presented in the box and she brought delight to my 7 year old for a day.After the 1st day, Suzie no longer worked. We tried replacing the batteries but to no avail. We should have heeded the advice of some of the other reviewers.If you want Suzie for her looks, great. But if you actually want a doll that works, consider a different purchase."
2,This CD is not by Disciple......,"Amazon has now appropriately switched the artist of this CD from ""Disciple"" to ""xDisciplex A.D."" My following review was written before the correction:This CD is apparently by ""xDisciplex A.D."", whom I've never heard of. Don't get them confused with ""Disciple."" The music is similar in style, but Disciple doesn't growl in their music. They sing and scream and the music is far more uplifting than what I've just sampled from these guys.If you're wanting something by Disciple, check out the ""Back Again,"" ""This Might Sting A Little, ""By God,"" and self-titled ""Disciple"" albums. They are all fantastic Christian hard rock/metal albums and some of my favorites. Disciple rocks!"
5,I didn't Know this!!!,I love this band! they rock and deliver a strong powerful message for people who may not believe yet!I had no idea there was an album by them called heaven and hell!I'll definatley get this one!thanx!!
5,Oregon Fruit Cherries,I have several recipes that call for these cherries but you can't always find them at the supermarket plus they are extremely expensive. I was excited when I found them on Amazon in bulk at a great price. Now I can keep an ample supply in my pantry.
5,Tasty and Not Overly Sweet Syrup,"I use these canned cherries for a cherry sauce I make at holidays. The cherries are firm and flavorful. The syrup is sweet, but not too sweet. Great product."
2,Poor Packaging,"This is my second purchase. I was a little concerned about buying them after reading the review about the worms, but that wasn't a problem. The problem is that the item is package poorly and half the cans arrived dented. This is the second time it happened. It will be the last as I'll look for a new supplier.Oregon Fruit Pitted Dark Sweet Bing Cherries in Syrup, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 8)"
1,Cherries or Gooseberries,I ordered dark cherries and I received gooseberries. Someone was not paying attention. My order conformation showed the cherries that I ordered.
4,excellent book,"This is an excellent source for basic information about the Vikings. It provides pictures of actual artifacts from the Viking Age, as well as photos of reenactors dressed in period clothing. A very informative book, for children and adults alike!"
3,"Decent, basic overview of some Java game desing concepts","I've been working through the book, and there are some interesting and educational concepts. The book assumes you have some strength with Java, and doesn't take the time to hold your hand through some of the more difficult concepts (I found that some areas from time to time could use clarification, so you'll need to do a little outside research.)The examples, and the game itself, is fun and simplistic. Jonatahn Harbour seems to have a zeal for the material that is evident in the writing."
1,Koolatron Krap,What more can I say. I should have paid more attention to the other reviews on this piece of krap. It consistantly maintained inconsistant internal temperatures ranging between 42 and 62 on the little thermometer atop the door. It also had a tendancy to freeze up and jam the cooling fan which was rather loud and constantly running. Buyer beware...stay away from this one!
5,Great fridge.,"This is a great fridge. It heats and cools, I only use it to cool. The purple is a very pale purple."
4,Love it,Rock 'N Learn: Money & Making change is a great product. It has truly helped my daughter improver her math skills. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,You love to hate him.,I started this series by picking up Should Have Got Off at Sydney Parade while in Dublin and I liked it so much I had to start from the begining. It's definitely written for guys because the women are complete idiot/bimbos and the men are sports studs but that's what makes it so funny. It's completely outlandish and it's hilarious to be in the head of this self-proclaimed sex god and living legend. Definitely good for a quick read if you're looking for something to laugh at.
5,i loved this dvd,"this dvd is perfect for the guitar player who's only played rhythem or basically needs the basics of guitar playing. paul shows many neccesary scales as well as octive changes. right away youll be playing somewhat basic lead guitar on the first day, after watching this dvd. you might not be great but with practice youll be good. he gives you the basic scales to improvise your leads if you stay in key with the rhythem youll sound decent. this is a good dvd for the player who doesnt know the basics of scales and octive changes."
1,Save your money.,"I own a lot of guitar books and videos. My Favorite is John Petrucci Rock Disipline. With Rippin Lead Guitar, it's more blues solos than anything. Paul has the personality of a tree. He stands there and looks unsure of himself. The solos are not melodic at all. If you want a great guitar DVD, I reccomend John Petrucci Rock Disipline or any of the Frank Gambale DVDs (Modes, No more Mystery). Also, MI Guitar Fretboard Workbook is awesome book. Best of luck."
3,Depends what you are looking for!,"This book, as the title implies, provides many excellent cover letters, however, it is poor in specifics. Unlike other books, this one contains very general advice and some statistics. I would recommend this book to those that want to get a sense of what other people's letters look like. I find that spending time dissecting these letter to be time consuming and tedious.Books that I would recommend are:""The Elements of Resume Style"" by Scott Bennett and""15 Minute Cover Letter"" by Michael Farr and Louise Kursmark"
1,Doesn't Transfer Well to Kindle,"I just want to clarify that my review is on the Kindle edition. I felt the book was helpful as far as reading the text. However, it was impossible to read the 175 samples which was a key element for me purchasing the book. Not having the ability to see all these letters defeated the purpose of purchasing it in the first place."
2,Not up to Gunn's usual standards,"I'm a huge Nicholas Gunn fan, but this album didn't score well with me. It's not nearly as rich and melodic as his first Grand Canyon album. This one is too ""out there"" for me."
4,Interesting Look at Potentially Deadly Machines!,"Even though machines can be a tremendous help to human beings, sometimes they can bite! Tim O'Shei takes a look at dangerous machines in this 2007 Capstone Press release. Part of the 'World's Top Tens' series, it's geared to readers 9-12.O'Shei examines ten machines in reverse-countdown order. Presumably the rank was determined by the number of deaths/accidents attributed to each machine. O'Shei's two-page write-ups cover specific items such as chain saws, lawn mowers and ATVs along with more general entries like ""hydraulic machinery,"" ""logging equipment,"" etc. O'Shei details the role of the items, possible dangers, common sense rules to avoid injury or death, etc. Color photographs compliment the text.If you're looking for a basic informational/educational introduction to machines for younger readers, THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS MACHINES will fill the bill. Recommended."
4,good song...good mixes,"the tracklisting for this cd single is:01 - album version02 - jermaine dupri remix03 - jermaine dupri remix instrumental04 - ben watt (of everything but the girl) extended remix05 - tim and jez mixdescription:01 - the original, with the funky slow-mo prince groove and his great crystal vocals.02 - great start, but then fails to do anything original, the weakpoint of the single.03 - same.04 - ben watt creats a funky, jazzy and tribal feel with his 9 minute dance remix...similiar to his reworking of sade's ""by your side"" very nice...similiar in style to his EBTG album tempramental work.05 - totally new instrumentation, effective use of female vocal sample...very nice, carribean, beach feel to it.overall, great single, and worth the money. a must buy for true maxwell fans."
2,Not for everyone,"I was very disappointed to discover that there were no entries for a very large area of New York State. Buffalo, Rochester and NYC were represented, but all of the Capital Region - containing the Albany Medical Center - was neglected. AMC has consistently rated in the top tier of hospitals in the country and is blessed with some of the best physicians/surgeons in the state. For those who live in or near a very large city, this book may be of some use, but be aware that not every city (even if it seems major to you) has an entry. In addition, some of the very best medical centers in large cities (the Massachusetts General Hospital for example) are largely ignored: perhaps there was an asymmetric distribution of questionnaires or an uneven distribution of respondents. All in all, I was quite disappointed with the ""Guide"" and felt it helped me not at all in choosing physicians for my family's care."
1,Not what expected,I ordered this for my young teen. It did not meet their expectation. I think they may of been expecting something else. Didn't seem very well done though.
4,"Great, refreshing sound!","Some of the songs on this CD, particularly the first few, are just great! This is a great band, worthy of a listen! The songs here can always pick up my mood no matter what!"
5,coral caalcium,I use this product daily to help with my calcium deficiency and I am pleased to be able to get it. Coral calcium seems to work better as far as I know.
5,Upland Outlaws-Part two of A Handful of Men,I love this story...so much so I've had it and the other books for over 10 years. I found somehow I had misplaced this one book and went looking for a replacement. I happily found the set of four volumes in A Handful of Men all came in hardback copies! yay! So I bought them all again so they will be available to my boys. One of my most favorite stories ever! Rap will always be King to me!
3,I was forced to buy it.,It's an okay text but the author quotes himself a lot. I just wish all the tables and formulas were in a specific location and the symbols for the formulas defined each time a new one was presented.
1,"Very disappointing, save your pennies","It's hard to think of something good to say about this CD. The audio is poor quality, with obtrusive environmental rain sounds. As an English horn player, I wondered why the performer is anonymous--no wonder, s/he is also amateurish, sounding like a woodwind doubler who spent 10 minutes preparing with little musicality and control of phrasing or musical shape. Further, the arrangements are frequently simplistic if not crude. I have never bothered to write a review before but was outraged this time."
1,"Weird CD, but Fantastic Seller","I ordered this CD from Amazon seller PRICED-LESSCDS-DOT-COM because I couldn't find Ravel's ""Piece in the form of a habanera"" elsewhere. I first heard this partially played on a trumpet in the 2001 film, ""The Deep End,"" and wanted to hear all. The ""Sentimental English Horn"" CD includes several other noteworthy pieces. I cannot fault the performers' playing, but agree with other critics that the environmental background is obtrusive. Furthermore, a manufacturing defect with several incorrect track listings exists. This Amazon seller is outstanding for their speedy delivery and full refund of a sealed product with defects they couldn't know. I personally recommend this seller for any future CDs."
1,the ENVIRONMENTAL english horn,"I didn't even get to listen critically to the playing, as the environmental sound were so completely irritating. Luckily I got this one really cheap somewhere, but frankly, it's about the environmental sounds, not about the English Horn."
1,Not magical - barely readable,"Secrets? Those that are discussed here remain so - being so poorly explained. Magic? That's a bunch of hype.This may be worthy your purchasing just to show yourself that not all that's titled ""Communication"" can communicate. The publisher claimed this was a ""clear an logical explanation"" hah!This book has the feel of one of those self-published items that gets no editing. Feel free to get a copy and check it out yourself - just be sure to keep your receipt.I keep hoping to find a well-written book on NLP (one that says more than ""for the real scoop on the techniques, be sure to 'attend a seminar by a certified trainer' because these techniques are SSSOOO powerful they might be dangerous."") Does your Bee eSS detector go off in response to that too?"
1,Bad Uke,"Totally agree with the other reviews on here. If I could rate this less than one star, I would. I try to tune this uke and parts of it start popping off. Plus the sound is dull and not at all quality. It doesn't look good either. Please, do yourself a favor and buy a different ukelele."
1,oops =( it looks like a defective.,"well, actually i have a exact same model with this uke.so i can compare this new uke with old one.it looks unfinished and faded color.also it has smudges out side, coarse,and dull sound.=( i want to change or refund this product."
4,Central America In a Nutshell,"This DVD includes 14 chapters addressing areas or cultures within Central America.Several of these are candidates for separate extensive DVDs. I would enjoy a DVD that provides more in-depth video of a transit of the Panama Canal, from ocean to ocean.The video quality was very good for some of the chapters, while for others it was merely fair.Overall, it is the most comprehensive DVD that I'm familiar with on the subject. The narrative is in Spanish. I have been unable to access the English subtitles."
2,Not my cup of tea!,I had forgotten just how bad that movie was. I had seen it before but just forgotabout the cast and crew. As far as I am concerned it should be taken off the shelf.
5,Far Country,"I bought 6 movies all westerns with Jimmy Stuart. In my opinion the best actor over all in any type of movie. You can't go wrong getting anything with jimmy in it. Also you get many other great actors supporting him, GO for it, I did and loved them all."
1,Not Happy,I would have returned it but my Mother-In-Law didn't watch the movie for a couple weeks. Then waited another to tell me that it didn't work. She said the sound would come and go throughout the movie and to spare my feelings they ordered a new one.
4,Fine Performances By Stewart and O'Hara,"THE RARE BREED is a film about the delivery of a white-faced Hereford bull from England to the Texas range for breeding purposes. The man responsible for the task is James Stewart. The women who own the bull are Maureen O'Hara and her daughter played by Juliet Mills. THE RARE BREED is a fairly good Western with strong performances by Stewart and O'Hara. A fine supporting cast includes Brian Keith, Don Galloway and David Brian.Andrew V. McLaglen directed many other good movies such as MCLINTOCK and SHENANDOAH."
3,Rare Breed,"James Stewart has always been one of my favorite actors. His acting style is like no other. With his down home slow talking he makes any part believable. If you like westerns and you want to be entertained with real acting guiding the story, then purchase Rare Breed. You will be well pleased."
2,Too cosy by far,"The Rare Breed is one of those lukewarm westerns from James Stewart's sixties' `loveable' phase when he abandoned the dark determination of the Anthony Mann films to go for a more Disneyfied comic approach. Indeed, the film feels more like a typical Disney family comedy of the 60s than a Western, an impression not dispelled by Jack Elam's comedy villain, Juliet Mills' and Don Galloway's juvenile leads and, most terrifying of all, Brian Keith in bushy red wig and beard with outrageous `Scottish' accent wooing Maureen O'Hara. Throw in the standard John (then still billed as Johnny) Williams Western score, and you've got an inoffensively bland but utterly unmemorable Sunday afternoon movie.The 2.35:1 widescreen transfer is more than acceptable, but the fullframe trailer has clearly seen better days."
4,One of Jimmy's Best and Brian Keith!,Jimmy Stewart had a habit of making good movies and this is one of them. It tells the story of introducing hereford(or herford) cattle to the united states and it does it partly lighthearted and partly serious. Brian Keith shows up as well as absolutely wonderful former scottish highlander soldier who's taken up ranching in the west. Keith is just great as the old cantankerous scottsman. The herford bull(named vindicator) is cleverly portrayed as well without being silly.
2,Waste of Time,"I know this movie stars James Stwwart and Maureen O'Hara. However, the plot for this Western is mediocre at best. Even some of the best actors in Hollywood history cannot save this turkey. Skip it- it will not be hard to find a better movie than this one."
4,rare breed,"excellent condition, thought it was a vcr though, and took forever to get...maybe I was just anxious.. would shop there again AAA+++"
2,Stewart's worst outing in a Western,"I'm still in shock at just how truly bad this one really is. I should have known better, thought this one fell through the cracks or something and it did...for good reason.Weak story is dragged down even further due to almost the entire film being shot in a studio. Some of it is comical, but not quite as comical as Brian Keith's wildman bagpipe playing Scot cattle baron. Hoot mon! You've been warned."
1,Not payable,"Rare BreedThe disc is not playable in Australia witch I found a bit strange as I ordered it from the Australian web sight, I was and an looking forward to seeing this move as it 2 of my top 10 favorate actor in it.To Amazons credit they are refunding me.I look forward to beable to watch this movie and changing my review."
3,The Rare Breed,"If I can't see Maureen with the Duke, James Stewart is a great substitute. And Brian Keith playing the scottish scoundrel is a hoot."
5,A Great Western,What a cast! This was a western that was different from so many of the other westerns that were being made. It provided an interesting take on how hereford cattle took over from the long-horned cattle & it was entertaining at the same time! Jimmy Stewart & Maureen O'Hara at their best!
3,[Three-and-a-half stars out of four] One of Jimmy's best!,A more romantic and pointed Westernand not the usual 'shoot'Em-up-fare'.Good supporting cast as well. Recom-mended!
3,disappointed,"When I ordered this book, it was described as ""NEW"", to my disappointment pages were falling out of the book when I opened it. This is the last time, I will order books from this company. Maybe they don't know how to rate books, but ""NEW"" should be ""NEW"", not pages falling out of the book."
4,A Great Teacher Gift,"This book was shared by another faculty member as a yard sale find. I felt the book expressed a variety of emotions that anyone of us may have experienced in an academic setting. The statements though short and sweet are written in a childs point of view. School needs to be a place alive with energy and and the capacity to allow a child's mind to soar. However, the confinds of the educational system and society, can lead to a less than desirable atmosphere. A great reminder of why most got into the teaching profession and a great gift to the graduate about to emabark on this career."
4,Geranium on the window sill ............,"Was thrilled to locate this book which I first saw in London in the early 70's. It was how i remembered it; the poems being a great reflection on the many issues or behaviours that children identify so honestly and correctly with, in regard to what really matters to them.I believe all teachers can read and take heed of the thoughts revealed in these poems."
2,ok,"book is a short list of thoughts expressed by author, thoughts he thinks his students thought about him or others as teachers"
3,Having trouble sleeping?,This movie is a total snooze fest. Kind of like a poor man's along came a spider. You've seen it before and it hasn't gotten better.
2,not my favorite...,"I bought this because it was filmed in a community near where I live, but I couldn't get all the way through it. Not worth the money."
4,Excellent Review of Short Game,This video provides a fun way to finetune your short game. Funk and Furyk are good friends and have fun in the video. They review the mechanics of each swing as well as how they think through the various shots presented around the green. I have had the pleasure of playing with Jim Furyk recently and he reconfirmed with me on the course that my handicap could be cut in half or better if I practiced the skills learned on this video (typical of most amateurs). I am going to try and create this challenge match with a buddy somewhere as this would make the practice a lot more fun. This video is well worth the norminal investment. I purchased a dozen for the people who were not able to play with Jim that day..small consolation prize.
3,Short game golf,Just medicore. Spend your money on David Leadbetters short game video or DVD. It is much more comprehensive and informative.
2,How sad,I got a beat up old library book which was not the condition listed. How sad someone thought it all right to send this type of product.
4,Good little bottle opener,"This is a nice bottle opener. Note that it is stamped from a flat peice of stainless steel, it is not cast. if you are expecting a thick heavy opener with a rounded ergo shape you will be disappointed. That is not a criticism, just making it clear what to expect.I am happy with my purchase and would buy this product again."
5,Oxo SteeL Bottle Opener !,I used to open up all my Russian Vodka bottles with a hammer then someone gave me this Oxo SteeL Bottle Opener. It works great. Oxo has some good products.Opens bottles and punches cans. I use it to punch oil cans. The sharp end can be used to remove grime in window cracks too.
2,Flimsy,"The rubber center and the metal body are not bound tightly so it feels cheap. Still it hasn't rusted after 6 months so that's good. Still if I'm not paying a buck for a cheapo opener, I at least expect something that doesn't feel flimsy."
5,A handy tool,"Purchased on a whim and I am so glad. It works so much better than my old bottle opener that has a rusty useless corkscrew. This one punctures cans easily, making a small task effortless, which is a big deal to me."
3,Overpriced,"It's a very good product but I could find similar products at less than half the price at local stores. It's just a bottle opener.. I don't need it to be ""brushed"" stainless steel. I would have preferred if I could get it for $3 or less."
5,Win!,"Another great product from OXO. I love all there stuff, as it all looks and feels great, and more importantly, they work amazingly. This can/bottle opener is no exception. Very classy."
4,Works great,"Looks good, works great, high quality which is to be expected from OXO products. Rubber grip is a nice touch as well."
3,rubber handle comes loose,Have had it about a year and the rubber handle is coming loose. Jiggles in the handle otherwise a good opener.
2,Can opener is dull,Purchased this to open bottles of liquid baby formula. Was thoroughly disappointed with the dull end of the can opener portion. Expected much higher quality. Bottle opener works well but can opener is surpassed by every other one I have tried.
2,Disappointing Quality,"Looks like some poor devil put the brushed finish on this thing with a piece of sandpaper. Honestly, it's not the usual nice quality you expect from OXO.The other reviews are so good... maybe they moved the factory, and a new group of underage indentured servants are making them now.In any case, it's going back to Amazon."
4,how good can it be?,This thing is fine but overpriced. Next time I will buy the $1 variety and replace it every 2 years.
4,"Great, but Big","The OXO SteeL Bottle Opener is great in quality. The rubber middle makes the opener easy to grasp and opens bottles easily. The opener feels very sturdy and durability should not be an issue.However, for those who plan on buying this to carry around such should not buy this. There is no comfortable way of sticking this into any pocket as one of the ends would be sticking out awkwardly. A keychain bottle opener or anything smaller would be more appropriate (perhaps a lighter if you're into that ;D ).But for it's intended use, this bottle opener is great to have."
5,Awesome!!,"Very awesome series, I have enjoyed Glen Cook's writing for many years now and this is another of his awesome novels."
3,An introductory guide,"Lots of good info for someone stepping into the metal boat market but I would prefer a little more detail to earn the title of a complete guide. There are a few nuggets I will certainly apply to my vessel. Good information being so scarce on this subject, just one good nugget is worth the purchase price."
5,The best book I have read on steel and aluminium boats.,If you are serious about building or refurbishing a steel or aluminium boat then this book is indispensable. It is in plain English and has lots of photographs and illustrations covering everything from the basics of metal boatbuilding to painting and electrics.
2,paid advertising,"This book has some interesting information if you are looking to purchase a kit from which to build a metal boat. Unfortunately, this book also spends as much time advertising their own kits as it does providing information. Each chapter eventually evolves into why their kits are better and as a result you should buy a kit from them. The book does manage to give a light overview of metal boats, and if purchasing a kit is what you are interested in, this might be a worthwhile effort for you, otherwise i would suggest finding books with less advertising and more information."
5,"The Complete Guide to Metal Boats, Third Edition","Being a joint owner of a steel spray for 10 years, I was delighted to read Bruce's new book. It is full of photos and information, and I recommend this book to anybody, owning, buying or contemplating building their own steel boat"
3,Too much fluff,"The story itself is interesting but the book contained too much ""filler"". Elaborate detail about subjects that did not contribute to the book in a meaningful way. If you reduced the book to ""non-fluff"" then it would only be about 35 pages in length. One could read the same story from newspaper articles and have learned as much - without wading through background info that was not pertinent to the story's viability.Book also contained an unacceptable number of typographical and grammatical errors that interrupted the reading flow."
3,Leaves a bit to be desired,"Package had no way to store the unused clay easily. Also it stated that the clay would never dry out, but after a couple of days in the open air, the clay was significantly dry and hard to work."
5,Fun for the whole family,"I got this from my grandchildren's wish lists. Of all the Christmas gifts, this one got the most use. My daughter and her husband are artists and their 3 kids are artsy, as well. They spent hours creating fabulous figures and then made stop-action videos with them. The clay is neat, dries well, and the colors are vivid. Highly recommended!"
4,Fun for kids but doesn't harden when you bake it,This is fun modeling clay to play with. It doesn't seem to harden if you bake it. We bought it because one other reviewer said it hardens when you bake it but it didn't harden for us. It just got soft.
1,too firm,"Item had great vibrant hues, but the clay proved extremely firm and hard to manipulate compared to other modeling clays that I've tried."
1,replica does not work.,Did not know I was buying a replica. It does not even work. Learned a good lesson. Will keep it to remind me to be careful in future.
5,Only Norm can do this type of comedy.,The only complaint I have about this DVD is it isn't long enough. Norm appeared sometimes on the Dean Martin Roasts. His humor is just as good now years later.
4,"Anyway, we can meet him again.","This CD contains the recordings of the live at the Indiana Speedway in 1983. That's the sole information I can get from the sleeve. The stage was huge and the audience shouted louder and the chorus girls sang louder and Marvin himself seemed a little weaker. The sound was sort of muffled with a low-pass filter or something. However, this surely captures Marvin's last days with his great songs after leaving Motown including Sexual Healing."
5,Makes you want to dance!,"If you like the music from the 30's, you will love this cd. If you watch TCM you'll recognize most of the songs from the old movies. This orchestra is fabulous and you will have to dance."
5,homegrown music at it's best,An absolute jewel of music. More heart and feeling than anything that has been released in recent years. From beginning to end there is not one bad track to be found. Treat yoursef and your ears to a one in a million unpolished gem of music.
5,Photoshop Studio with Bert Monroy is latest edition of this,"This is a truly great book but Monroy has made a new book called ""Photoshop Studio with Bert Monroy"" which is essentially an updated version of this book. I bet it would be a better buy."
5,Great book!,"Digital master reveals his ""secrets"". Great addition to my library of Photoshop books. Pictures alone worth the price of the book."
2,"Great Art, little substance","Sure, it looks great, but it will find a home on your coffee table before you actually use it to make you more proficient in Photoshop or Illustrator. The Illustrator portions are specifically weak. Interesting ""how I did this"" book, if you're in to that sort of thing. But don't expect to be creating art like this guy, who has been using software like this for years to create photo-realistic scenes."
1,Don't expect to do this yourself,"Sure, this book has amazing images in it, but don't expect to create anything like them yourself, until YOU put in fifteen years of work. Very depressing from that point of view."
5,Great reference for anyone dabbling into lighting designs,"For those willing to integrate a unique lighting design into their premise or commercial abode, the multiple lighting solutions and systems afforded into this literature is ideal for those willing to expand their design horizon to new dimensions..Very useful for selection of lighting types to achieve that ideal interior feel for any area.."
5,You can really find your chi!,I bought this book to replace one I lent to a friend and never got back. It was one of my favorite books. I never knew how powerful your chi was until I did the exercises in this book. It took me a couple of tries before I found it but I was truly amazed once I did. This book is simple and easy to follow. The exercises are very easy even though they look a little scary if you thumb through. I would recommend this book for any one who wants to find their inner chi.
2,Misleading Advertising here,"They always have this page saying only one left. This has said ""ONLY ONE LEFT"" ever since I first looked at the item. And, even after I bought one, it still says ONLY ONE LEFT HUTTY and buy it now."
3,Western fanatic,"I found this movie pretty good considering when it was shot and the fact that none of the modern technology was available at the time. James Stewart, as always, was very good and Audie Murphy, although a quiet spoken man, was also good but such parts, because of his quietness when speaking, I feel do not really suit him. I am biased towards westerns so more often than not enjoy them."
3,Might Have Been,"This is a pretty intriguing picture if only because it's a case of a potential classic that didn't come off. It marked the beginning of Anthony Mann's decline as a director; he walked off just as shooting began, the same stunt he would pull on ""Spartacus"" two years later. James Stewart, who was his own producer for most of the Fifties, was furious, as well he might have been, and never worked with Mann again, despite their wonderful collaboration on eight previous movies. Its a shame the two of them couldn't have cooled off, put their heads together, and ironed out the script problems. There is some beautiful and novel material in ""Night Passage,"" the story of an outlaw gang preying on a new railroad in the Colorado mining territory. Great performances by everone, especially Audie Murphy. It just needed a stronger hand at the helm to pull it all together."
4,"Great little story, some excellent performances","This isn't a classic Western, but it's a darn good little movie. Jimmy Stewart is perfectly cast as the older brother, and once again makes acting look easy. Brandon de Wilde, one of the best child actors ever, does a good job in his role as the youngster at a crossroads between good and bad. And Audie Murphy absolutely shines as the Utica Kid. The few times he was cast against type were some of his best roles (such as No Name on the Bullet).Not many boring moments in this film. And make sure you look closely at the railroad boss' righthand man, who is not happy with Jimmy Stewart being hired to carry the payroll. Hugh Beaumont could play a good tough guy before being cast as Ward Cleaver, the Beaver's dad!"
2,Pretty silly 50's western,You can see why Anthony Mann - originally signed to direct - walked out on this film. The script is pretty silly and the characters uncompelling. Perhaps this film would be better described as a musical as Jimmy Stewart finds every excuse to sing while playing his accordion - yes really! A footnote in western film history.
2,I Would Pass On Night Passage,"I viewed this film for the first time and was very disappointed. The story is not very good and I wished James Stewart got rid of that stupid accordian. I like James Stewart in films like Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington and Destry Rides Again with Marlene Dietrich. This film lacks many qualities and does not come across as a film destined to be classic. I think the main distraction is the constant singing by James Stewart (Who is not a singer by any stretch of the imagination) and the playing of the accordian. I didn't get any feeling for the characters. The film comes across as a 'B' film. Not one Jame's best I'm afraid. Some of the scenery is nice, but a film needs more than scenery."
2,Jimmy plays the harmonica and sings.,I counted 5 instances of this before I fell asleep. Not his best outing.
1,How to scrape the bottom of the barrel...,"...or how the western was killed! Universal here really scrapes the bottom of the western barrel. Not even the great James Stewart can hold this dead all alone. It is not just a matter of lack of ideas: the whole conception is bad and useless. About the video: colors are often alterated, so the quality is not that good... Forget about it."
4,Great replacement product,"I installed these wires on a 02 ML 320 (95k miles) after getting a quote from a mechanic for almost $800.00 for 12 plugs (two per cylinder) and individual wires ONLY if needed. Less than $300.00 for parts with all new wires.I used Denso iridium plugs in addition to these wires and promptly gained almost 2 mpg.The steel covers weren't quite as long as the original wires but I attribute that to everything being made less robust vs. 10 years ago.My only other complaint was they only gave you one VERY small pack of silicone grease. You would need probably 4 packs that size for 12 wires and plugs.After all that was said, I buy them again without hesitation."
3,Misleading,"""A Century in Captivity"" is an excellent book and provides a lot of interesting information on the history of the Newgate and Wethersfield prisons in Connecticut, but when I started to read the book I expected to read about Prince Mortimer himself and not the details of two very significant prisons. The author admits that there really isn't a lot about Prince's life to go on and includes what he can here and there, but that doesn't excuse the poor choice for a title, which I think was meant to add shock value in order to sell books."
2,Cheap plastic,I threw it away when it came and found one that was metal.instead .the plastic strips to easy and can't clamp down as well as I enjoy to do for nice sharp cuts.
3,Good but no October Project,"In summary, this is a good effort on Mary's part but the material is a tad weaker that when she sung along with her buddies in October Project. The best song of the 4 is ""Redemption"", the rest need refining to reach the October Project standards she set up for herself when with the group. Overall a great effort that I am sure will get better in her full album release...I would wait for the album, at least you'll get 11-14 songs vs. just 4..."
2,Beautiful voice - terrible mastering,"I love Mary Fahl's voice. It is absolutely unique. Haunting, inspirational, throught-provoking, genuine. I loved October project and like most fans, was angry when their recording contract was canceled.I do have one complaint. The audio quality is poor. In fact, it is really bad. The engineers and producer need to go. The recording is very 2D with very little depth. There is no bottom end and instruments and vocals smear together.Mary, if your reading this, you are awesome. Get a new producer."
3,Great Voice - Weak Material,"I'm glad to see Mary is finally doing something with that great voice of hers. I miss October Project and their awesome lyrics and melody's. I can't for the life of me imangine why Mary would leave the band when the music sounded like it was written just for her. The new music is OK, the last song ""Redemption"" is the strongest track on the 4 song CD. Mary has the voice but lacks good material. Mary, do us all a favor and go back home to October Project and the incredible songs of Julie and Emil. That band should of never ended."
2,Don't Buy This CD,"There's no question that Mary Fahl has a great voice, as most of the reviewers here have attested. But check out the fine print (that Amazon forgot to mention) ""Selections from..."" There are only 4 pieces on this CD, three of which are on The Other Side of Time, which is a great CD and costs less than this one. What kind of marketing hype is this? Buyer beware."
1,not available anymore,"This item is no longer available. I ordered it and was sent a different kit, which will not work. Contacting the seller, I was told to use this anyway. Contacted manufacturer where I was informed they will not make kits for the Mitsubishi 3000 gt anymore."
3,"Ok, but could be better","I bought this for a 97 Mitsubishi 3000 GT. It fits perfectly, BUT you have to cut part of it as specified by instructions. Do not understand why it does not come already cut and ready for a single din. When you install a single din in it you can not really secure it as there is no metal frame that comes with it and the unit's frame can not be bolted or secured for this item."
1,Waste of money!,"J.K.Rowling should never have allowed this junk! The books are GREAT, but that doesn't mean you have to buy the junk these money craved companies put out."
5,Great for kids and adults!,"Original UNO (Crazy 8) with a few HP twists. Both of my children (5 yrs & 8 yrs) love to play daily. Have had it for a month and they haven't tired yet. Great family game, too. Opportunity for kids and adults to interact. My children play with us (parents), aunts, uncles, etc. If you don't have UNO already, buy this instead, even if you're not a HP fan."
4,A game that the whole family can play!,One of my family's favorite things is to cuddle up on a cold night and play this game! It's not like those games that confuse kids or bore adults. We all love it!
5,Best Ripper quarterly out there,"I hate to say it, but this little American newsletter that started back in 1999, and is now 120+ pages four times a year, has beaten the UK Ripperologist magazine at their on game. I do warn you, that once you get one of these in your hands, you will want to read the other 23 issues that came out before this one."
5,awsome band,Found out about this band from garageband.com and i have been a fan ever since. its one of those albums you can listen to all the way through. the album is definitly well put togather and screams radio to me. great buy in my book
4,Excellent Beginner Book,"With this crystal-clear reference, networking professionals can cut through the complexities and gain a thorough understanding of the features and functions used to successfully configure Cisco routers. This book includes step-by-step coverage of how to create router configuration files from scratch and build multiprotocol networks from TCP/IP to OSPF and BGP plus traffic management techniques for AppleTalk, IPX, SMDS, and ATM Configuration.Not only is this book great as an on-the-job reference, but it also prepares you for Cisco certification by presenting all the fundamental concepts and commands in an easy-to-understand text."
4,Very Well Written,Who would have thought that this book could be so comprehensive? This book is a perfect place to start for MCSE's who want to move onto the 'good stuff' - routing with Cisco routers. Use this and the Sybex CCNA Study guide and you'll get through the test no problems.
1,I think I know why I am the lone reviewer...,"Very, very, very, very boring. I was disapointed because this was the first book I have read on Irwin Rommel. I will have to go back to the drawing board to find better books because this one reads like a manual to my DVD player. Not good at all."
2,"Good idea, but not strong enough",I got this for my lab. The light is not very bright since it is produced by a single LED. The reflector is much more visible. Unfortunately the collar broke the first time my dog pulled hard. The small dog version probably works ok. Not strong enough for bigger dogs.
2,Size was off and needs to come with extra batteries,The size I received did not fit my dog. I still was able to use it but had to use a separate collar underneath. We used it maybe 5 times and the batteries needed replaced. Was definitely not my favorite amazon purchase.
3,Excellent Debut but Without Punch,"I was interested in this book because it was written by a screenwriter and I wanted to see whether the two disciplines complimented each other or not.On the whole I found the novel to be well structured and well paced, with excellent character observations and a brevity of prose that was refreshing.However, I also felt that it was a novel that was written almost as a compositional task rather than out of any passion or human empathy. I didn't really feel any sympathy with the main protagonists and so the story I felt was slightly dull.I can see why it was placed on the Booker Prize Long List in the UK, because for a debut it is very good, but it lacked any fresh or potent message apart from an obvious one, that of privileged people who act selfishly - which isn't a very original idea."
5,are you mad!!!,"Just to let that ""EUROPEANS"" as you state in your review had nothing to do with this film. Were you alsleep during this film. You state that you can only see a trunk opening and a window roll down. So you missed the part where mary carmichael appears in the car and gets her revenge, or the part where you hear her being strangled in the back.Okay, its not gonna get an oscar, but the acting is good, especially david letch, and heather bolton. The film is quite old, so its not going to compare to todays horror flicks where you have screaming bimbos with blonde hair running in to dark rooms with no weapons, being chased by a killer in a mask (YAWN).You review was unfair to people who might want to purchase this movie, also you might want to get a geography lesson, as NEW ZEALAND does not come under Europe. Thank you."
5,This is one smart hamster!,"Houdini is a clever little hamster who can escape out of any cage! He is able to understand human speech. He is called names & locked in a freezer, caught by a dog & yet still manages to stay alive! Read this if you like hamsters or animals!"
2,I Houdini,"I HoudiniI Houdini is a book about a genious hamster who longs for freedom. He's called that because he can escape the very best made cages.I think the author, Lynne Reid Banks wants you to know that you can do any thing you if you're determined and keep trying.I liked the way the hamster thought and the way he despised other hamsters. I also liked the way the author discribed the book. It was full of suspense all the way through, and was easy to understand."
2,Didn't get very far,"I only read about the first 100 pages and couldn't get any further. Parts of the back story didn't seem to add up and I suspect were either missing critical details or had been embellished. Once the guy got to India and the school, rather than make observations about large social issues, the author seems to focus on the senseless little things that the children are doing. The story probably gets better, but I couldn't keep reading. It seemed like Will's purpose in writing the story was to show how cool and interesting the children at his school were, and I just didn't find any of it interesting."
4,"Overpriced, but well organized","As a longtime learner of French (and other languages) I found this book more useful than many others. While the exercises are useful and the explanation of grammar rules (in French, of course) are well laid out, the excerpts of stories need some improvement.But most likely, if you're considering buying this book it's a requirement for a course, and you don't have much choice in the matter anyways :)"
3,Seems to work pretty well,"Bends the tubing fairly easily if you need very precise bends, though I find the traditional handheld bending tools work easier if you don't need a precise bend. I also had a problem with 1/4"" tubing kinking with bends that got close to 90 degrees. That might be operator error though.Lisle tools are traditionally made in the USA. It makes me nervous that nowhere on this tool or its packaging does it say the country of origin. Federal law states for a product to not include its country of origin, it must be made in the USA. So I'm assuming Lisle is following the law and that this tool is made in USA."
4,Worked great with 3/16 brake line,"Used it to make all new brake hard lines for a Geo Tracker using 3/16"" line. The tool worked great though you cannot make extremely small radius bends."
3,A typical southern potboiler,"This work is supermarket Faulkner: about as tedious as Absalom, Absalom, though containing much shorter sentences, and far less gripping than Intruder In The Dust. What used to be called miscegenation, Klansmen and their prejudices and foul language, brutality toward women, infidelity, and racial stereotypes are all in the brew, which is seasoned with a lushness of metaphor taken mainly from the kitchen -- e.g., from the first page of text, ""The atmosphere back at the big house had been battered and coated with a thick crust of anticipation...."" Such turgidity suggests that the author's bruited twenty-five year absence from literary endeavors was mainly devoted to culinary efforts."
5,original story by one of the greatest US explorer,It is very sad and so unfair that such a great explorer is not recognized in his own country. His travel stile and quality of his travel records are much better and much higher quality than any of his accusers. His business success in Texas is another great misfortune. He is one of the greatest explorers of his time and it is great to have his own story published.
4,Gypsy Jazz,"Pearl Django, as their name suggests, follow the Django Reinhardt Hot Club of Paris Gypsy Jazz style. The music is great. Smooth, plenty of technique and melodic. Modern recording techniques mean that this group is likely to appeal more than some of the original Django recordings. Listen to the title track - if you like that one, you'll like them all. This recording should appeal both to jazz fans, who'll particularly enjoy the virtuoso technique, and to casual listeners who'll like the swinging melodies. Highly recommended."
5,"""Gipsy Jazz"" Gems","As the name implies, Pearl Django is a band based on the musical traditions of Django Reinhardt and his acoustic, Paris-centerd jazz stylings of the 1920s, 30s & 40s. This is a fine CD which offers a modern take on this traditional jazz form."
2,Some Advice for buying Loupes-,"This Loupe's magnification makes it unusable. Its field of view is very small, you have to get really close to what you are looking at, and there is a ton of distortion.If you are looking to buy a loupe, I would recommend a 10x loupe in the $30-$60 range with a field of view of ~15mm."
2,not a very clear view,"Unfortunately, the product is not very well made. In the past - I had a doublet, 2oX which worked a lot better. I have trouble seeing the item I am scoping. in the purchased loupe.Yes, the glass needs to be right up against the eye, and the item in question. Still cannot see it very well."
2,Hard to use,"Not sure if it is just me, but I cannot see clearly using this loupe. I have tried everything !"
2,Had to return,"Had to return this item. Don't know if these items a quality checked before they go out, but I could not see through the lens and neither could anyone I showed it to."
4,good product,"im not sure if this is 30X, i bought this product to look the GIA number in my diamond and worked pretty good for my objective."
1,China cheap!,Made in China! Not happy about it at all! One of the contacts at the bottom of dist. cap was milled too far. I used it anyhow as I was going out of town. It'd been beeter to go to the local parts store where I could see the product before I bought it.
2,Great movie - Terrible transfer,"Legend has it that this film put Bette Davis on the map in Hollywood and it's easy to see why as she gives an absolutely mesmerizing performance - the first of many in a long career as a great film actress. It's unfortunate, however, that the film - at least on this DVD - has not been restored. And it needs it *badly* as the picture is fuzzy and ""washed out"" and the sound is even worse. It's two stars for the poor quality of the DVD. If I were just rating the film itself regardless of the quality, it would be five stars."
1,Terrible Acting,"Davis was terrible in this movie. She can't do a cockney accent to save her life.There are only so many times I can handle a close up of Leslie Howard giving his ""stricken"" look.I fell asleep four times trying to get through this film. Boring, boring, boring."
2,"ok, but not as good as I wanted it to be",I had hoped it would be more interesting-but kinda boring and not very informative...but I wasn't a fan of the movie either.
4,Better Than Most Smooth Jazz Out There,"I have had this for about ten years. The songs are listed above, so I do not need to list them. Sam Levine is great sax player and arranger. I rate this CD 4.5 stars, and I am rather picky. This CD is way better than most smooth jazz being produced today."
4,Great ideas for low-cal cooking,"Though this cookbook does not contain pictures, it contains a lot of great recipes that are quick, easy to follow, and healthy. They have quite a bit of flavor as well, and the portions aren't skimpy (like the weight watchers cookbooks I've found). The recipes are varied and don't call for unusual ingredients - but you'll find that this also isn't your typical American ""SAD"" fare skinnied down. The recipes are healthy by nature, focusing on healthy ingredients rather than diet-oriented substitutes or trendy low-carb fare.The cookbook also contains a lot of helpful information on healthy eating and what it takes to lose and/or maintain weight from a healthful, long-term perspective. This is a great addition to my cookbook library."
3,Great Recipes,"There were a lot of good heart healthy recipes in the cookbook. I would have liked to have had a picture to go along with each recipe. Sometimes, I can tell if I want to cook the recipe by looking at the picture first."
5,I love this stuff!,"I love this product for many reasons, but the two I'll mention isa) It cleans without drying out the skin.b) It is a good value."
3,Bare bone locks for a bare bone price,"Ok. Maybe I am a dreamer, but locks are about locking a door so people you want to keep out of your place stay out, right?This lockset will help you do that, to a degree. I happen to have bought two locksets, separate items and separate orders. Both arrived in great shape, thanks to Amazon.com.But, truth be told: the keys to both locksets fit both locksets!!! Pretty scarry.To sum up: buy this lockset as a basic deterrent, but don't count on the potential home-invader to spend more than 60 seconds to crack this one..."
1,Total Waste of Time,"I am not sure this person was educated on how to write--numerous errors and mistakes. The content is slim at best, for the price of the book, it is a waste of time. I would either buy it used for a dollar, or find a new reference.Don't waste your time with this one."
1,THE WORST BOOK OF ALL TIME,Don't flush your money down the toilet by buying this book as I did. This book has a lot of unnecessary informations that isn't even relavant to the title of the book. There should be some standards as to how to write a book. The sole purpose of writing this book is rip off people without even giving them their money worth. This book has a lot of grammatical errors and very boring to read. It seems more like a collection of topics of other programming books. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE
2,Good job boy's but get a band!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I really enjoyed the first cd Let the chicks fall,And I have seen the boys live with Bass and another picker.I found out that the boys made this ala john fogerty playing every lick on their own.This is where great songs and really neet arangements turn into weak demo sounding cuts. Do not get me wrong I love these fellas but please get a outside producer like ...Nick LOWE and hire some real players to fill in the gaps!"
2,Good Start but........................................,After the release of Let The Chicks Fall I waited for the next offering from these brothers who will not let West Texas Rock and Roll die. On my weekly raido show I let my listeners know the boys will be back.Frank and Chris ya let me down... Right in the middle of a great rock a billy romp ya hear some Gawd awful steel playing then its like the beatles meet Gary S Paxton. Hopefully threes a charm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,good music but too long!,"I saw them on my trip to san diego last year .Great live band so I was really looking towards this release . Great start but as the cd goes on and on you ask your self are they surf ,mersybeat or what! next time fellas dont put so many songs on !"
2,beware - description says it's organic but it's not,Please be aware that this tee from Frontier sold by ABC is non-organic. I informed ABC about it but the product's 'Ingredient' desciption still mentions organic Earl Grey tea.To be fair they offered me to return the merchandize and receive a refund.
4,Good book for finishing in various techniques,"With this book I'd learned new techniques for finishing my furniture.Buy it, it's readable and very interesting at good price.regardFerdinando"
2,Too many colors for the palette,"Although I loved the paintings and the transparency, even I who have been painting watercolors for more than 10 years found the number of paints used are too many and, in trying to do them, found the demonstrations too complicated. I remember an instructor saying that 3 colors to mix was enough. I wouldn't recommend the book to a beginner."
1,its terrible,"her voice really is terrible, compare her with the previous celine dion i adore so much, she is a defnite turn-off now, and the more i listen to her songs the more i resent!everything abt her is wrong, ever since she become famous ! is fame gettin outta hand for u ...may be so! pls dun buy her album ..till one day she realise her big mistake, then i will continue my support for her"
1,utterly disappointed,"i am so depressed when i heard celine's album. nowadays she is really deproving day by day album by album...i am really sorry to say this...she won't go far if this go on...i have true faith in her, but i want something more solid and more down to earth..."
1,the worst singer,"she is practically, and basically the worst singer i ever heard, though many claim that she is one of the most popular singer, but she get famous because of connections, the titanic fad, and more...this album is trash, really i agree with open arms that this album is trash!"
1,Child birth is less painful!,"That voice of hers kills me. If I hear the ""Titanic"" song one more time, I might do my best impression of a Xerox copy machine repairperson."
1,Not as advertised,"This product was sent to me missing everything except the disc and pump. Amazon was very good about sending me another one, but the new one is exactly the same!! Missing everything. So disapointing!! I will be sending this one back shortly for a full refund."
2,this ain't Piledriver.....,"OK, I got suckered into buying this based on some of the reviews. The usual ""as good as the old stuff"" crap. Plus the fact that i've been playing Piledriver quite a lot lately, I was willing to give it a chance. Well, I was duped. It's definitely a lot lighter weight and poppy.If you're expecting another Hello, Quo, or Dog of 2 Head you will be disappointed as I was.If you crave some awesome early boogie, pick up Cactus' live 2CD set."
4,This Cd is a Gem,"I just received this cd in the mail, haven't taken it out of the player. It' a really good album. The music is pure Quo at it's rockin best. If U really love this band and their music U'll add this one to your collection. I'ts time Status Quo was put into the Rock N Roll hall of fame."
4,At last! Quo finally go back to their roots.,"Without doubt, this is the best Rocking Quo album since Lancaster and Coughlan left, or at least since ""Just supposing"". What is even more staggering is that there are 14 tracks on the CD (Well the UK Special addition has the Bonus track ""Money don't matter""). Around the time of the Classic Quo releases, there were only 8 or 9 tracks. The 1st 7 songs really do ROCK, and includes some great harp from Andy Bown. Also, his piano playing has much more urgency. What has probably been the inspiration to this re-emergence is the re-introduction of Bob Young to the song-writing credits. In my opinion, there are two Weak tracks, the afore-mentioned Money don't matter, and the only non-original track ""Jam side down"". Quo will never be able to release another ""Hello"" or ""Piledriver"". That is impossible. To be honest, it would be a major achievement if Quo were to better this album for starters."
4,A Defense of (Japanese) Humanism,This movie presents one of Kurosawa's best defenses of humanism in Japanese society in the form of a period piece. It is a supremely powerful and touching movie and as most know would mark the end of his partnership with Toshiro Mifune-which would be an end to one of the greatest eras in Japanese cinema. I can't go into anymore detail than has been already said and hope that you really take the time out to watch this film.
2,Not one of the better Kurosawa movies,"I am a big Kurosawa fan, but I barely got through this (luckily I watched it in a theater!). I'm used to slow pacing with Japanese film, but this was just dull. And sometimes unpleasant. If you're a completist you probably should watch it, but if you are just looking for a good flick, go with one of the more famous Kurosawa works (Seven Samurai - my favorite, Rashomon - truly a classic, Kagemusha, Ran, Hidden Fortress, Dreams, Rhapsody in August, Ikiru ... )."
2,Not worth the money....,"I bought this for my husband almost two years ago. It remains on his wall in a spare bedroom, but it doesn't seem to work terribly well. It never seems to coincide with the weather outside....He seems to enjoy it though."
5,College student in southern California,"This book is a must read for anyone who wishes to understand the individual differences in people. Kagan, a Havard Professor, fills this book with information relevant to all areas in psychology. I referred to it many time for my thesis."
1,3 of 6 reviews indicate faulty hinge/doors POOR PRODUCT,"At first glance this item was perfect. The color matched the interior of my car. It was heavy enough to stay in place without sliding around. However, one of the two top doors was missing two rivets that held it onto the hinge. This became apparant after opening/closing it just a few times. I am returning the item for a refund. READ THROUGH THE OTHER REVIEWS - two other customers had the same exact problem. That doesn't say much for quality control.Wolf 38602005 Consl Dlx Flr Mn.Van Gray"
2,Shipped with broken hinge,"one of the lid hinges had two of three rivets broken in the box. I'm not sure how it could have happened during shipping, given the packaging. The broken off rivets were in the bottom of the compartment. There was also some gunk on the leather. It may have come off, but given the damaged lid I didn't even bother trying.Other than the quality of the hinge fasteners, it looked like decent quality. The grey didn't completely match the grey in my 2-tone leather seats ('05 Grand Caravan SXT), but was close enough."
2,Received defective product twice.,"So I had to manage to fix the second item myself with parts from the 1st item. Workmanship is so-so on the product, but most importantly the product was not packaged properly before shipping which cause damage in transit I suspect.I also expected better storage capacity/organization in the compartment given the unit's external dimensions, but all spaces beneath the cup holders were just blocked off by boards internally, easier lining job inside but waste of precious space.However, this is still better than the plastic alternatives we had before in giving you the factory look."
4,Sandy Patti,Sandy has one of the most beautiful and elegant voices of christian music. Her voice is so powerful yet sweet. It makes one feel as triumphant as one should feel while praising the lord.
2,Some Dialogue!,"This book is advertised as being ""the dialogue of letters between Arthur C. Clarke and C.S. Lewis"". Well, it turns out that the letters take up a grand total of 17 pages, and there are only 8 letters from Lewis to Clarke: 1 that occupies a full page, 4 that occupy a half page each, and 3 that are 2- or 3-liners. The vast majority of the pages in this slim book are devoted to reprinting short stories and essays available elsewhere. Even the publishers seem to have realized that calling this a ""War of Letters"" is overblown, because when the book arrived its subtitle had been changed to ""The War of Ideas"".When it comes to CSL correspondence collections, I think this should rank dead last on prospective buyers' lists, behind _Collected Letters_ (available from the UK), _Letters of C.S. Lewis_, _Letters to an American Lady_, _The Latin Letters of C.S. Lewis_, _A Severe Mercy_ (by Sheldon Vanauken), and _Letters to Children_."
4,nice overview of subject and authors,"good reading.for someone interested but not very knowledgable about the subject (but a fan of both authors), i found the book to be a good overview of the subject. i enjoyed the profiles and, of course, the short stories.the letters were good to read, but i think somewhat limited. they didn't give me a strong sense of context for the ideas being debated. did others participate? i'd like more of a larger overview of the issues, including other authors as well."
3,Some goodies...others ok,"We bought this only to get Fluffy's Master Plan for World Domination after watching them sing it in Felton. We got it. It's good. I really loved some of the others too. This is not my favorite Bobs album, that would be Get Your Monkey off My Dog, but it's still fun and worth the price of admission."
3,You'll Need a Coaster,"On listening to the CD, you might spill your drink while playing it for friends while reading the lyrics for the first time. Although there's no cussing, there are two songs that leave no doubt as to their strong sexual content. Coaster needs an explicit lyrics warning. Despite ""...Earl"" and ""Rubber Girl"", the album has some redeeming qualities, particularly the first couple songs in the Turtle series, ""Bring to Boil"" and ""Fluffy's Master Plan for World Domination"". How often does one hear a song sung from a turtle's perspective or about making Ramen, or about the cats' plot to take over the world? Buy selected mp3s, not the whole album, and read the lyrics first!"
4,Finally on CD!,"I had this LP, purchased from a record club, when it was first released. I really like the story telling and acoustical guitar that made me feel like I was part of the adventure. So, over 30 years later, having long since lost the album, I've tried to tell my wife about it, but there is no way to explain it without listening to it. When we found it was available on Amazon, I ordered it, and when it arrived, we put it on our outdoor stereo as we did some yard work. While my wife heard the Four of Us for the first time, I enjoyed pleasant memories. It was nice to have John sharing his adventure with us in our Alaskan gardens."
4,A bit of everything here!,Black Keys fans take note: Did Dan Auerbach hear this in the womb? The blues and rockers sound it to me and even Dr John played on a cut! This will sound outside the box to Lovin' Spoonful fans but in a good way.
2,Strange...VERY strange,"John B. SebastianQUITE occasionally the John Sebastian that I know and love and emulate surfaces, once, I think, even playing Harp. Otherwise this is just an attempt at something I certainly don't understand. Almost EVERYTHING else he's done is in my collection and there's not much disappointment. I'll probably play this once in a while to figure out what I'm missing. If you're particularly enamored of his harp playing check out Welcome Back, Tar Beach, Daydream and Do you Believe... with the Spoonful. His J Band stuff features a lot of his harp and Annie Raines, with a distinctly different style, also harmonicasizing. His voice, they tell me, has gone the way of Polyps, so the older stuff features that lovely voice."
4,Wonderful album,"The title track to this album got me through a business trip to Poland that included a visit to a former concentration camp. After that horrendous experience, to hear John tell the stories about his cross-USA trip with his wife and another couple was what I needed to regain a sense of equilibrium. The other tracks on this album are terrific, too."
3,The medley is worth the price of the CD,Mostly forgettable songs - Sweet Muse and The Four of Us being the exceptions that make the CD worth having.
3,Not as good as the other BUNNICULA books,"This one was just alright. It's the second sequel to the classic original BUNNICULA. It's not really bad but it's boring in part; like I found the whole first chapter to be a bore.It does get sort of scary in parts, but nothing major. Read it if you want. It's fun. But, for really good BUNNICULA bookds, I recommend: BUNNICULA, THE CELERY STALKS AT MIDNIGHT, HOWLIDAY INN, RETURN TO HOWLIDAY INN, CREEPY CRAWLY BIRTHDAY, THE FRIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS, HOT FUDGE, RABBIT-KADABRA, and BUNNICULA STRIKES AGAIN."
2,1 year replacement,I wouldn't use this product again. There was no paperwork sent indicating what the terms were or even if I actually had the policy in place.
1,still haven't recieved 1-year replacement,Bought this before Christmas and still haven't recieved the information on the 1-year replacement....My Daughter loves the Sansa scan disk. Amazonis always fast with delievery. But I don't know if I would do this again.I know it's coming but way to late.:(
3,Warranty Slow to Arrive,"Be aware that it takes weeks after you receive your product before you receive the warranty documentation in the mail. I wish Amazon would have told me because I figured it would come with the product but it does not. You will just have to be patient.From the other comments that I have viewed, the warranty company is hard to deal with. I will have to wait and see and hope that I do not need to use."
1,Won't honor their coverage,"This purchase is a complete waste. The rep was rude, and they refused to allow our return because there are a couple of days left on the manufacturer warranty. I asked if I could call back then, and they stated no, it is now in my record since I called, and it will no longer be honored. Amazon has been absolutely no help whatsoever in assisting as well.Looks like I'm going to have to dispute through my Visa buyer protection. So all in all this purchase was a complete waste of money and time."
1,STILL WAITING,"I PURCHASED THIS WARRENTY FOR MY KODAK PRINTER/SCANNER/COPIER. IT;S BEEN 1/2 MONTHS, AND I AM STILL WAITING FOR MY WARRENTY. I RECEIVED THE PRINTER, AND HAVE PRINTED OVER 200 PICTURES ALREADY, AND AM STILL WAITING FOR THAT LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER. NO EXCUSE FOR THAT."
4,This plan worked for me,"I bought this coverage for a Canon Powershot A590IS digital camera. The camera worked great for just over a year, but then stopped working and wouldn't even power up. I contacted N.E.W. to make the claim. They asked me to send the camera to them and two weeks later I had a check for the full replacement cost. Well worth the cost for this plan."
2,A good insurance policy.,This is a good supplement to the manufacturers warranty. It arrived almost a week later than the product for which I purchased it.
4,Strozzi,"Great content that is well written, easy to understand and moves the reader to believe that the material is breakthrough if embodied. Enjoyable read."
2,Extremely disappointed -- not as advertised!!,"Not as advertised, it talks about a signed print included, which wasn't, and it talks about 5-foot foldouts, which it doesn't have, and it talks about how oversize it is, when in fact it is quite small, I'd say about 6 by 9 inches, just slightly larger than a regular paperback, certainly not a coffee-table size book. In other words, false advertising!!"
2,Disappointing,Based on the title and cover picture I thought it would be a good book. I was wrong. I guess you can't judge a book by its cover.
1,Tiny little book,I should have read the description and paid more attention to the reviews. This book is tiny for a collection of photos. They have no impact at all. Maybe an avid golfer would have a greater appreciation.
2,l'instant de guerlain...,i am not sure this was a original ...for after using l;instant de guerlain for the pass 5 years ...this one has much tomuch alcohol and the sent is not exact...in my opinion ...sorry to inform you ...sincerly eliane ambrose
1,Wood working???????????????????/,"Ordered this blade, sure not for wood, this blade is for metal. wood is for wood, metal is for metal, enough said."
5,A True Role Model for Today's Youth,"I have always respected Paul O'Neill and looked up to him as a young Reds fan growing up outside of Cincinnati. His book gives you a heartfelt in depth look of what made Paul O'Neill the humble, hard working, family man that he is and that is none other than his father, Chick O'Neill. Their father-son relationship is bonded by their love for one another and their love for America's favorite pastime. This is a great read about family and baseball."
5,Me and My Dad,This is a great book and it brought back terrific memories. A great read for all baseball fans especially for youngsters learning how to play the game right.
2,"A nice tribute to his father, but not much else","While I can respect the idea of this book as a tribute to his father, I can't recommend it as an entertaining read. Paul O'Neill was a decent ballplayer with the Reds who became a great ballplayer with the Yankees, but he's pretty dull no matter what uniform he wears. This was a nice idea, but check it out of the library unless you live and die Paul O'Neill."
3,Me and My Dad by Paul O'Neill,"An enjoyable book and perfect for the summer. Nothing new or earth-shattering, but Paul O'Neill is a good comapny and it's an enjoyable beach book."
1,the frustration of fascism.,"a piece of junk written by a member of the ssnp, a secular and the most fascistic ideological enterprise in the history of the middle east.do not waste your time and money on it. the ssnp and its frustrated intellectuals cannot pen but junk..it deserves a minus 5 stars.."
1,Opinionated gobbledygook,"I bought this book, imagining it was filled with fans doting on about my favourite movie series. But in fact, it was filled with that awful self-important ranting that so many annoying critics favour. Some of the chapters were ammusing trips down memory lane, a trip I can certainly share. But most were simply attacks on the Star Wars saga (a more and more common stance these days, since George has now decided that Greedo fired first, and since he introduced us to Jar Jar Binks, it has become cool to rag on the series). I began skipping chapter after chapter, constantly muttering under my breath, ""Why did I waste my money on this opinionated gobbledygook!?""Save your time and your money. Unless of course you enjoy listening to critics whine about how stupid things are."
3,Acceptable product.,"Not what I expected. Too cumbersome for my taste. If boat has any kind of motion,as we have most of the time while in the water, it is not easy to install."
1,Elephant Rhapsodies,Great to listen to while working in the house. It has the same effect on me as hearing windchimes in the yard. Somehow calming and peaceful.
1,Wrong Picture!,The photo of this teapot is misleading. It shows the 75 oz. teapot with the handle for easy pouring near the spout but I received smaller 32 oz. teapots. I based my order on the picture and thought I'd ordered the 75 oz. teapot.
1,Looks great....doesn't work so great.,"the color is awesome cobalt blue, too bad it doesn't work, the contents are very slow to pour due to the fact that all the holes that lead into the spout are blocked - the glaze is the problem on mine. the beautiful cobalt blue glaze is actually covering the holes that allow fluid to pass into the spout.I might be able to get a very long drill bit and drill through the glaze and reopen the holes.No matter what, this is a quality control issue, they should check and see if these things work at the factory.I look forward to finding and buying an American made teapot that works.I would not recommend this item if you actually enjoy drinking tea.If you need a shelf ornament... this teapot is you!"
1,"looks good, doesn't work: tea spills out",I'm happy w/ the look of the kettle but the infuser holes are too large and tea spills into the pot and then clogs the holes where the tea comes out.It sucks. Just not worth my time to return.
4,small but cute,Gave this teapot as a christmas gift. The teapot was smaller than I expected but still very cute. The color is very pretty.
3,"Good tea pot, nice color",It shipped in a timely manner and this is a nice tea pot. It steeps loose bulk teas and tea bags.
1,Nice looks but not very functional,"The one thing that struck me about this teapot was the nice color and looks on the website. I decided to buy it because of the positive reviews ( albeit only 4 total reviews ). The moment I unpacked and tested it out, I was having problems. One, the way the spout is constructed, the pot gives a really weak stream and you practically have to tilt it vertical to get it to pour which leads to two problems - one if the lid stays on, spillage coming from the top. But the top doesn't lock on so you have to be careful or the top will just slide off and shatter on the floor ( as it did to me ). Very disappointed in my purchase"
3,"great little teapot, didnt have infuser tho","this is a good-sized teapot - holds enough tea for 2.5 large mugs, or 4-5 small cups of tea. it is a very nice blue (like the picture) and looks nice on the counter or when serving tea. it did not come with the infuser, so i've had to use my own. I am not sure if this was a fluke or a consistent problem with this teapot. I kept it even without the infuser because it is still a good teapot for the money - it is made of nice quality porcelain and is well made."
1,"Wish there were ""zero"" stars.","I should take a video of this teapot and include it, because the spout is so ridiculous that it's not even usable. I plan to return it immediately. The spout pours SO SLOWLY that eventually as you're tipping it (almost vertically), the tea spills out the top of the pot, past the lid.This is just awful construction.ETA 12/6/11: I have since returned this pot and purchased a one quart pot from Tea Works that is beautiful and veery functional."
4,Super fun!,"This a great game that you can take anywhere. It's simple and kids get to do what they love most -- run! Fun for even adults, but could be a little dangerous with all the canes and walkers."
3,"Okay, not awful, not wonderful. About what you would expect for the price.","For the money paid, this is an OK set. Nothing really great, but not terrible either, just kinda middling. For a starter set it is pretty good I guess. It's kinda light and doesn't feel particularly strong and well built, but it looks nice. Time will tell if it holds up. My biggest concern prior to ordering was the sewn-on points - would the tips get bent up after play? The answer is yes, they have curled up a little on the point ends, but it's not a problem. It only affects it from a cosmetic point of view. Overall I am happy with my purchase. i would recommend to others."
3,"collection, not a single work","A collection of essays, not many of which have much bearing on my work. For the online-only shopper, a note in thedescription that includes a TOC would be helpful to distinguish it from the more central sources."
3,Harry Potter trivia review,"The harry potter trivia game was somewhat fun but not very educational.the game was very durable but for [the price],My pick would be somewhere else."
2,Not MacLean's best,"Amsterdam Airport - the best in Europe - is flooded. Some planes are still floating aimlessly around. Some have sunk out of sight their tail-planes sticking up above the water, scattered at random over a large area of the airfield. The wall of water was the work of the terrorist movement FFF - an Irish organisation who want to force Britain's hand. Detective Lieutenant van Effen is called in, a feared interrogator and undercover intimate of the criminal Krakers gang to sabotage the FFF plan. If van Effen fails and the FFF get control over the vital dyke, either Holland will sink beneath the sea or Britain will be awash with blood."
3,Dazed and Confused,"This anthology contains classic work by Jeff BECK (not Back, as Amazon lists), one of the great guitarists of the 1960's (Yardbirds, Spencer Davis Group, Jeff Beck Group), as well as hugely underappreciated pianist Nicky Hopkins (Quicksilver Messenger Service), who took the The Rolling Stones' Beggars Banquet and Traffic's Feeling Alright to another level (as well as Joe Cocker's stab at Feeling Alright). Jimmy Paige, later of Led Zepplin, is also featured."
3,Childrens book... sort of.,"I mostly dissagree with Amit Ghosh's review. True it doesn't look that great for a childrens book and overall probably isn't a great childrens book. Then again it's a CHILDRENS book and I'm not sure children would really care for how good the art is. But as an artist and animator, I fully appreciate this little book myself. Mark Andrews was the lead story artist on The Incredibles. His work is quite amazing if you can get past the fact that animation art has more energy and wonderment as rough and quick sketches. His other book, Colossus is a marvel but is definitely not a childrens book. Objectively I give this book a respectable 3 stars. It's not the greatest kids book but if you like animation art, it's a must."
1,Bad book...should have given 0 star if I could,"Never buy this book if your child is a fan of the characters of Incredibles....The illustration is poor (and thats an understatement)...and the story goes nowhere. Though the item is not highly priced, it doesn't make sense to throw away whatever its price is."
2,So Much Potential,"The chunky 2-CD set of 50 recordings from 14 EP's could have potentially been one of the best anarcho-punk compilations ever....if not for production glitches that nearly make a number of tracks unlistenable.Through a problem in remastering, the use of flawed demo tapes and/or defective vinyl sources, quick skipping/repeating plagues the first CD; it's a real nuissance on arguably the most controversial, satirical and biting series of numbers on the ""Better Dead Than Wed EP."" The second CD is nearly perfect, contains the strongest remastering and ends with the sonic brutality from the ""Tribal Warfare EP.""By eliminating the rough sounding cuts and slicing it down to one CD, this would have been a phenomenal release. Without an updated version surfacing, the set should only draw interest from serious collectors and those who don't have a problem with bootleg-styled sound snags."
1,this cd is DEFECTIVE!,"DON'T BUY THIS CD. I've bought it twice and both my copies have manufacturing defects. CD 1 ""skips"" about every fifteen seconds. it's not actually skipping, but there must have been some sort of error in the mastering. CD 2 plays fine until the last track at which point it skips (really skips, unlike cd 1) like crazy...avoid THIS mortarhate version...I'm not sure if the Go Kart version has the same defects."
5,on time and correct,This was the correct item and it arrived within the estimated delivery date. The book itself is great and has wonderful graphs and diagrams to help explain more than just the Law.
2,No James Doohan,"Somebody is confused. ""River of Stone: The Powell Expedition"" is actually a documentary narrated and directed by Robert Redford. James Doohan is nowhere to be seen, nor any of the other credited actors. Mildly interesting, if you like shots of the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River."
1,Amazon is confused!,There are 2 River of Stones... One is a documentary with Robert Redford and the second is a movie with James Doohan. I was hoping to find the movie with James Doohan here but all I find is the documentary. Amazon is confusing the two. I can't seem to find the movie anywhere. The Internet Movie Database is also confused. They have the cover for the documentary with the info for the movie as well.
5,Great baby sitter,"My 4 y/o Lil girl loves doc and this movie keeps her busy! And it's also educational. Would recommend to all kids, wish there were more doc movies."
5,wonderful,"We have had this video from the library for less than a week and I cannot begin to count how many times my daughter has watched it. She also backs it up to play the music over and over so she can sing along. Its seriously cute with NO princesses, no bad guys, no wicked stepmother. My daughter is already inspired to be a doctor of any sort and this video just enchants her. So I'm ordering one for us to keep."
5,Best Children's DVD on the Market!,"The Doc is on DVD! Love, love, love this DVD set. The big book of boo boo's activity book that comes with it has fun stickers and kept my niece happy for days!Great value with the digital copy that I can use on the go!"
5,We love doc!,"My 6 year old daughter thinks doc mcstuffins is great, as does my 3 year old. Its one of those kids shows i dont mind watching. She has good morals to the story and the toys in the "" cast"" are as adorable as can be. I enjoy watching this with my kids. Our favorite part is the monkey siblings,his name is ben, her name is anna and together their"" banana."" how cute is that....okay disney if you produce these monkeys and put them on the store shelves we will buy them! Ha ha. We do love doc and i dont tnink you would go wrong buying this for a child between the ages of 3 and 6, our son is very drawn to this show and hes a boy who likes all things boy and usually could care less about girly things or for tv more then a few minutes but this does grab his atttention. Highly recommend, hopefully we can buy more doc mcstuffins dvds in the future!"
5,Wonderful show!,Am so glad is coming out on DVD my Granddaughter loves this show.I just showed her on Amazon the picture of the DVD and she was soexcited! Cant wait to pick this DVD up!
5,Wonderful show,"If you haven't seen Doc McStuffins but are looking for a sweet show with a good message, this is it! It's calm and keeps my young boys' interest over and over again. There is no annoying music or fast paced craziness like so many kids' show have today. My boys ages 3 and 5 feel like Doc is their friend. The episodes on this DVD are some of the first episodes of the first season."
4,The kids loved this movie,The kids really liked this dvd. It is great for the youngest at 2 years old. Even the 8 year old enjoyed watching it. I can hardly wait for the next Doc McStuffins to come out.
5,Doc DVD,"Love the cartoon and was so happy to see it on DVD, thanks Disney! Will purchase future releases if available"
2,check what you receive,"Just a word of warning on this product. There are apparently two versions - one with the activity book and one without. I was sent the one without, even though it clearly said there would be stickers. And you can imagine what happened with my 2-year old when there wasn't stickers!I contacted Amazon and they are going to send me the correct one. They are even taking the return of an open DVD since it is their error.But just to help others, check the packaging before you open the celophane, it the top bar doesn't say activity book, there isn't one in the package.I will modify my review when I actually get the correct item.UPDATE: the new one they sent also did not have the stickers and I was told that I would probably never get them. They are supposed to be updating this listing. I am sure my daughter will love the DVD, but she would have gone crazy for the stickers."
2,which episodes?,"My daughter is in love, love, love with this show. (she's turning 3 this week). But without an episode list, I can't tell if this DVD is worth $15 or not....."
5,Love watching,She loves watching all of Doc McSuffins programs we will have to get her more of these DvD's she loves.
5,So excited to have gotten this DVD!,My daughter is in love with this show and all the department stores were either SOLD OUT or did not carry this DVD. So excited to find it on here and at a good price!
1,Misleading,The 5 episodes on the DVD were already on our DVR. I was under the impression this was a Doc McStuffins Movie of some sort....Big let down for my 4 year old... I feel like I paid $16.38 for the stickers that came along with this DVD.
4,"A good place to start, but it needs more","It's hardly fair to try to put 30 years of music on a single CD. John deserved a 2 CD set to represent him well (so far only Jarrett and Garbarek have been so well treated in this series). So what we get here is a vary wide ranging selection from power-house to swing to solo. But what is here is great music, in the end it's a good listen, but I would not want this to be the only JA I own."
4,REALLY NEEDS 2 CD's FOR FULLER OVERVIEW,"Abercrombie is one of my favorite guitarists so I have just about everything here on other CD's including the one cut from Kenny Wheeler's quintet album. These selections were chosen byJohn himself and it's interesting to hear what he likes from his own discography but I was a bit disappointed that he didn't choose much from his quartet albums that are STILL UNAVAILABLE from ECM...the one cut from QUARTET is indicative of this group's interesting music...MESSAGE TO ECM: PLEASE RELEASE ALL OF JOHN'S BACKLOG (M, ARCADE, QUARTET)...Anyway, this should be a double cd with maybe some alternate takes because everything here is redundant...Could have been much better! But ****s for the music."
1,This is JUNK do to a poor design DO NOT BUY THIS!,"Absolutely DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I am not kidding. Just like other owner's, I too had the same problem with it. The tiny c-clamps/rings pop off when you tight the clamp onto the wood and renders the clamp useless. This happened on the first project that I used it on and now the c-clamp is gone and the product is useless without the part. DO NOT BUY. The manufacturer should be ashamed of themselves for making such a cheaply built product. Other manufacturers make this same style product, but they don't use the cheap c-clamp keeper rings. Didn't they test the product before they put it out on the market? The manufacturer should refund everyone who has ever purchased this item because this problem will and has happened to every Irwin 226200 corner clamp that they have made, not just mine. BOOOOO!"
2,Major Flaw,Thsi clamp has some good qualities but it has one major flaw. The tightening screws have an e-clip to hold them. If you put a little pressure on them they fly off. I had to drill the shafts and installed roll pins to make the clamps usable.
1,shame on Irwin,My c clips didn't pop off like everyone elses but it's because when I first tried to use it I noticed that it was off by several degrees making it useless as a corner vise. DO NOT BUY.
3,"I'm not bragging, babe, so don't put me down","This CD compiles hot rod music from three different albums from the Del-Fi Records vault. The albums are:Drag Beatby The De-Fenders (12 out of 12 songs included),Hotrodder's Choiceby The Deuce Coupes (11 out of 12 songs included), andHollywood Dragby The Darts (8 out of 12 songs included). In case you don't know, hot rod music is basically surf music with a focus on cars instead of surfing. The three albums that these songs were taken from may be credited to three different groups, but most likely they were all recorded by the same group of musicians. The songs are enjoyable, if somewhat generic sounding, hot rod instrumentals. Some of the songs have car sound effects added to them. The songs are all originals, with the exception of a barely recognizable cover version of ""Little Deuce Coupe"". Fans of surf music may want to get this CD."
4,Mini Toshiba,We love this little TV The digital options for Channels are awesomeSound is not great with DVD's You have to turn it up to almost 50 to hear it well.... We are afraid we are going to damage the sound!Otherwise it is a great little TV and Amazon was so cool to have it in stock and ship it to us pretty fast...We were confused at first with the shipping dates from Amazon It was in stock but had like over a months worth of dates that it might be shipped. That is on Amazon. Not very clear as to the exact shipping date even when we tracked the item!
5,Delighted with this TV,"I grew up when TV was white snow on a small screen. I'm not extremely picky about TVs but I've very happy with the fidelity of the picture and sound PLUS the easy of moving. So light weight. I'm a senior citizen so moving anything can become a real problem. I unpacked the box, hooked this TV up and started watching Satellite and playing DVDs. I didn't buy it for the DVD player but it will be used periodically when I'm not using my external DVD recorder/player.Good sound, Good picture, ease of setting up!"
4,Toshiba Small Screen,received product in good condition. TV worked fine and had a beautiful picture for being a small screen tv.
3,great picture but...,"we received this tv for our kitchen and the picture is great. the one thing that bugs all of our family is how slow the response is when you turn it on, change channels, etc. When you turn it on, it says ""please wait"", and then it takes a few seconds for a picture to come up. Then when you change channels it takes about 3 seconds to make the switch. it is REALLY annoying! But, like I said the picture is nice, and the footprint of the tv is pretty small so it doesn't take up much counter space.the DVD player feature is nice; and it works pretty well. I guess if I had known how slow the response time is i might not have gotten this tv, because even on our old crappy tv set that was in the kitchen it had immediate response time. But i don't feel like returning it and so we'll keep it. but next time I go to buy a tv, that will be one thing I check first!! maybe in time we'll get used to it."
1,"GREAT PRINTS, BUT PRINT-HEAD REPLACEMENTS ARE A SCAM!","Like everyone else, I was initially blown away by the photo quality but soon got burned with a defective print-head. Canon never reveals that the $100 print-head has to be replaced every 3,000 ~ 5,000 pages, otherwise I would never have purchased the unit. Heck, that's not even a case of paper! As a result I won't buy another Cannon product again. So I just bought a Dell 5110cn laser color printer."
3,"Good photo printing, but it just quit!","I've used the printer for about 2 years and was very happy with the quality of photos it produced. But lo and behold, it just quit on me one day. Now I've just read several other reviewers who had the same issue. At this point, it is cheaper to buy a new printer. I did so and bought the Canon Pixma iP5000 and I absolutely don't like it. I guess my advice at this point is stay away from Canon. This from a die hard Canon camera fan."
5,Truly a great printer for photos,"I recently upgraded to the i950 from my year-old 500 series Canon. I thought the old one printed great photos (it did) but WOW, the i950 really is remarkable in terms of resolution, color accuracy, crispness, etc.It also is extremely easy to set up. I recommend you use Canon Photo Paper Pro for ""keepers"" and Office Depot for everyday photos. I highly recommend the i950. Rarely has a product so exceeded my expectations."
5,Excellent photo printer,Excellent quality - I researched all printers and bought this. It is fast and the pictures are great. few suggestions:1. Call Canon to have them walk you thru install - apparently XP can pose a few issues as well as getting the calibration correct (We had try to do a few things I otherwise would have been stumped on). Give yourself about 30 min - 1 hour to do full install and test.2. Buy the adapter - I did not realize it didn't come with the printer.3. Buy the Canon printer paper (see recommended accessories) I tried using HP and other cheaper paper and they just don't come out. Order thru Amazon as it is by far the cheapest...buy all this now so you can be set up and ready to go when you receive your printer & get the free shipping.
2,Must use Canon products,"Good printer if you are prepared to spend $11-$12 per Canon cartridge and use Canon paper. If you plan to use compatible cartridges, anticipate lots of color and clogging problems. If you expect to print lots of photos, as I do (new baby), expect to spend $50-$80 per month on cartridges alone. The ink runs out very quickly! Paper by other manufacturers tends to misfeed.As a graphic designer, I was hoping to use this as a back-up printer for work. I've had to stop, as I find it too expensive to run.Otherwise, good print quality, good skin tones."
2,POOR QUALITY,We have printed about 400 sheets through this printer and then the print head malfunctioned. And I see by many other reviews that this is a common problem. I'd bet all other Canon printers are short lived too.
4,"Print head--yes, it's true.","The aforementioned print head clogging issues are true. I used ours for a little over 2 years, and then clogged. Worked great up to that point. Buying a ink jet printer is one of those rare situations where buying the extended warranty may be of benefit--i.e. CompUSA gives a 2 year TAP warranty for 35 bucks (usually with 20$ worth of coupons for ink cartridges), so you just turn in your printer shy of two years, get your purchase price credited to your new generation printer, all for the cost of a 15$ warranty. Something to think about when you'll either have to buy a new print head (or more likely a new printer, since a new Pixma iP6000D online costs only 110$) in 2 years or so."
2,Lack customer support,"Bought the i950 last spring and it worked great until Nov when everything came out with a blue or green cast. Tech support would not help since I had replaced the cartridges with compatible cartridges and not with the Canon brand. They would help if I replaced all the cartridges with their brand, With a cost of almost $80.00 for their cartridges I felt it just wasn't worth spending that much. The i950 is simply too expensive to maintain so I'm back with Epson."
1,Good While it Lasted,"This was a very good printer, while it worked. After two years' moderate use, it began acting up. After arguing with it for too long, I realized that it was pumping black ink into the yellow cartridge. Every yellow I install ends up that way. Canon tech support advises that I needed a new print head at $80+. Forget it!My next printer will not be a Canon. I'm mulling over running the printhead through the dishwasher or sormething like that. It probably won't take kindly to that sort of thing, but with nothing to lose..."
1,i 950 Not a good printer,I have also purchased a new print head after the dreaded 7 flashes.Nothing works. This printer was well taken care of and not used that often. Canon rushed these printers into production with very little if any field testing and reliability testing.Do NOT buy this printer. YOU WILL be sorry.
1,Yes another bad review - product doesn't last,I'm really disappointed in the Canon i950. Started out great but like others I've learned that the printer head needs to be replaced. The cost of the printer head is not worth it and certainly makes the printer a poor value. I like Canon cameras but definitely not a fan of this printer. Spend your money elsewhere.
2,Another throw-away product,"I really liked the quality of this printer when it was new; the pictures were outstanding. However, after only two and a half years of relatively light use, the printer head has failed. This is no different than having an engine fail in one's new, shiny car. What would one's reaction be if the dealer said ""oh yes, after 2 years you have to replace the engine"" ""Didn't anyone tell you?"".I expect more from a noted manufacturer such as Canon . Canon should be ashamed. I have had enough of throw-away products and the corporate mentality that produces them. I ask: just who does make a good reliable printer that will last for a few years?"
3,Perfect until warranty ran out,"I bought this printer along with an eMac promotion to use with our FujiFilm digital camera. The printer worked great until the warranty ran out and now the printer head doesn't work and I have to buy a new one. It costs $100 to get the printer diagnosed, no parts, when I could buy a new printer for better. This time, I will read lots of reviews, because I see others are having the same print head problems. Bottom line, great photos, poor longevity."
2,I'm done with Canon products,"Had the i950 for about 10 months before major problems set in. First pictures took on a strange blueish hue. I replaced the ink cartridges for lots of money. It worked for a while then stopped. I stopped printing pics for about 3 months, then came back to it and the printer wouldn't budge. Totally gone. Canon support couldn't help.I also can a canon s400 camera. LCD screen went bad one day. I sent it in and canon told me I got water into the camera. I'm anal about that and can tell you that water never got into the camera! $100 to fix it. 6 months later the problem came back. Canon said it's past their service guarantee, so it would have cost another $100 to fix it.I switched to Kodak EasyShare camera and printer and am totally happy now."
5,A Great Photo Printer,"I bought this printer to use with a Canon A50 5-megapixel camera. In a nutshell, it is easy to set up, easy to use, fast (4x6 print in about 30 seconds) and, most important, makes prints indistinguishable from film. Being new to digital photography, I can't tell you what a weird and wonderful feeling it is to have film quality prints pop out of a printer on your desk, but there it is. You won't be disappointed."
1,no more canons for me,"This printer should have lasted much longer. It was a higher priced printer but had great reviews. This printer was not over worked and was kept clean yet it now flashes 7 orange 1 green. (new print head) For the price canon wants for a print head I can buy another printer and I will, just not another canon."
1,All pictures have yellowish tone,"Initially the pictures were amazing. Then after I printed about 50+ pictures over the period of half year, they started to all come out with a yellowish tone. Replacing ink cartridge with its canon brand ones, deep cleaning, realigning the print head, none worked. Canon's solution is to replace the print head which cost $100? Not acceptable to me."
1,Piece of junk...,"I received this printer as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago. As a result, I will never buy a Canon printer. The ink is extremely expensive. The pictures faded over time (yes, I printed on photo paper). And now to top it off, the printer head is going bad with minimal use over the years. I have nothing positive to say about this printer."
5,Love it so much I'm buying a second one!,"This printer exceeded all my expectations. Definite plug and play - super easy with MAC OS 10 as well as system 9. Print photos, text, layouts, everything. I use iphoto, photoshop, quark xpress, powerpoint, etc. Colors are very true - both to PMS and in photos. Easy to calibrate. Love the individual ink tanks - have gotten surprisingly good prices for supplies from Canon and BJ's. Have at the office, now buying for my home."
1,Expensive to use. Misleading marketing,"The i950 worked well for a little while when all of a sudden the machines stops functioning. It turns out that the Printhead must be replaced periodically and that Canon considers the Printhead to be a 'consumable'. I went back and checked the documentation carefully and there was absolutely no word of a printhead needing any sort of replacement. Well, what do you know??? A replacement printhead runs you over $100!!!!This is a case of deceptive marketing and questionable engineering. But then again, if they were truthful about their printers, who would by them? I'm done with Canon."
3,Only good print quality on canon paper,"I just got my i950 and print several photo, I print on glossory photo paper (1440*720dpi), and got very bad result. then I print on a 0.7mil(2880 dpi) premium photo paper, also got bad result, slightly better than glossory photo paper. but when I use canon photo paper pro and matte photo paper, I got very good quality. but canon photo paper pro is so expensive, almost 1$ for one sheet(8.5x11) in Fry. so I suppose canon just as Epson make money from their ink, canon make money from their photo paper.if you want print good quality photo, it's seem you must use canon printer/canon photo paper/canon ink/canon digital camera....all canon's!!!If you don't like to use canon photo paper, you'd better select Epson or HP, I used Epson printer before, Epson printer seem print good quality on many kind of cheaper photo paper, and now with 1440x5760.I just feel disapointed with canon i950 can't print good quality on third party photo paper...."
1,a disappointment,Worked great for the first four months. Now I either have to spend $390 to get it fixed by Canon or throw it in the trash. Pretty frustrating.
2,The prayer Jesus gave us.,"Roberta Bondi chose a personal letter form to share her thoughts on the Lord's Prayer. She presented her struggles with each phrase as it related to her childhood. Bondi's life experiences caused her to feel pain and anger when saying the words of the Lord's Prayer. Her suffering focused my attention on her problems and struggles which dissected the Lord's Prayer into unrelated parts. This not only took away the beauty of this prayer for me, but reduced it in the eyes of one who sees meaning in simplicity; like the very young child who accepts our Lord's Prayer in faith."
4,A Good Mystery,"This is the type of ""noir"" that gives the genre it's name. If you liked ""Laura"" then you'll like this one! Mark Stevens plays a hard-boiled ex-con detective who's being framed. Helping him out of the jam is his secretary, Lucille Ball. She is terrific in this drama, street-wise and loyal. It's a shame that Hollywood didn't recognize Lucille's talent and use it more often."
2,Young Lucy Deserved Better than This Movie!,"According to Lucille Ball's autobiography, ""Love, Lucy,"" Lucy had a mild nervous breakdown during the filming of this movie, due to outside personal problems. That explains a lot about the way she LOOKS in this film. I am the biggest Lucy fan on earth, and she handles her lines very well, but there is an empty-eyed, haunting sadness and apathy about her in this movie that just doesn't seem like her at all. Also, the plot is a little weak, but over-all, it isn't that bad. I saw it on AMC, and enjoyed it, but I don't think I would buy it, when there are so many other great old movies out there."
3,"Decent Noir Overall, But Weak Ending","This was a so-so film noir that could have been very good had it not had a an ending that was so weak.The cast was solid, however, playing interesting characters. It featured Mark Stevens, Lucille Ball, Clifton Webb, William Bendix, Kurt Krueger and Constance Collier.Ball was the most interesting to view simply because most of us remember her as ""Lucy"" on TV and in 1946, she was as alluring as I've ever seen her look. I would like to have seen her in a few more film noirs. Collier had a classic beauty, but she's an actress who is unfamiliar to me, unfortunately. I believe her career was nearing at end at this time.The story actually moves pretty well with just a few short lulls. Now that it's out on DVD, perhaps the number of people who are aware of this relatively-unknown film noir will increase."
4,Not your typical Lucy!,"Lucille Ball stars in this film as the secretary for a private investigator. Not her typical comedian role she is best known for. However, I have to admit, she is very convincing in this role. I enjoy film noir and rate this as one of the best of the fox series. A must buy for film noir fans."
3,Too unbelievable...even for noir!,"The good news: Clifton Webb and William Bendix steal every scene they are in - with the other players - and especially together. The Fox B&W; ""House Look"" is stunning.The bad news: The Hep, Wise-Cracking, overly cute, noir dialogue is preposterous. Nobody in real life ever conversed this way. Miss Ball, although top billed, is bland and adds nothing to the film. Any Fox contract starlet could have given a comparable - or better performance. Giving credit where it's due, however, she was a great looking dame. Mark Stevens recites his lines adequately but never convinces.The plot moves along nicely until that ever-so-familiar, Deus ex Machina cliche (you've seen it many times before and countless times afterward) that so neatly wraps up the proceedings and exonerates our hero.Juggling the pro's and con's, this is worth a look to film buffs as an interesting product of it's time."
4,great cast,I liked this movie. First of all it is a great oldie. Black & White & the cast was wonderful. Clifton Webb makes the best bad guy. & William Bendix also makes a good bad guy. Lucy was a little out of it like the other email said but she was still good. And I loved the ending. Great pay back
3,"Good noir, but could have been much better","""Dark Corner"" is a perfect example of a B noir: strong in parts (gorgeous cinematography, some good acting, effective writing) but weak in others (sloppy editing at times, Clifton Webb's pallid re-creation of ""Laura""'s Waldo Leidecker, and an ending that seems tacked on). But even with the inconsistent quality, there are unexpected pleasures to be found, as in most noir films. Among my favorites: the snappy, natural way Mark Stevens and Lucille Ball flirt on their first date; the grace-note humor in several scenes (e.g. an eavesdropping movie cashier, the weird little girl with the slide whistle); a brief but satisfying encounter with jazzman Eddie Heywood.I like ""Dark Corner"", but it cries out for the extra care that a bigger budget would have provided. Oh well, they can't all be ""Laura""!"
2,Good Noir Bad Transfer,"This is a good easy to follow story without many surprises. It is interesting to see Lucille Ball out of her comedic role, as it is to see William Bendix as a heavy. The disappointment is the poor transfer from film to DVD. If you can get over many sections of the film with the characters heads cut off or the characters out of sight to the sides of the film you might find this film enjoyable--it needs to be redone the right way, even the low price doesn't merit this kind of treatment."
4,A Surprise Film Noir From The Queen of Comedy,"Anyone who knows Lucy's body of work knows that she is the Queen of Comedy. But, to see her in ""The Dark Corner."" was an unexpected surprise. Her performance in this film was outstanding."
1,Go to CostCo!!!,"I thought I would put in my 2 cents...I would not suggest purchasing this product through Amazon if you have a CostCo nearby. At CostCo they're priced at $14 for 8 bulbs or <$2/bulb (my reason for the 1 star for the Amazon purchase). The manufacturer of these bulbs is Feit Electric. These are really more equivalent to a 50W to 55W bulb. As for the delay in turning on... Well, these are flourescent and they will take almost a second to turn on! They do not have to heat up a tungsten filament, they have to supply a high initial starting voltage to excite the gas and then reduce the voltage while maintaining a constant current. A cold environment will make these more difficult to turn on (if they turn on at all). My ref: Electronic Ballast designer."
3,(Not really ordered or used),"I'm not sure why I'm on the list to review this. I had it in my order queue by mistake, but removed it and ordered another product from the same manufacturer. I can't comment on the effectiveness of this product."
5,Small Printer-Big Success,"I needed a small portable printer for my laptop, and after researching them, I chose the Canon i70. It has all of the attributes I needed-lightweight,super easy to use, fast as the office rumor mill, and a great print job. I highly recommend this product to anyone fortunate enough to have purchased it."
5,Perfect replacement,I had a Canon i70 stop working on me and to get it repaired would cost much more than getting a new printer. I found this item online to replace my dead one and have been happy with it ever since!
4,very nice...,"well....it's a VERY nice printer.... good quality! especially if i was to compare it to my $20 Lexmark inkjet.... it's fast and quiet. I guess the only complaint i have about this printer is that i'm already out of the black ink, and i only had it for about 3 weeks... i dont think i've done that much with it.... so that's the only bad thing! oh, and if you connect via the infrared, u dont get to see the status of the ink.... so it pretty much took me by surprise when the ink ran out......."
1,Poor Customer Service,"Try calling amazon for service on something you bought...good luck...this item doesn't come with a cord to connect to your computer, and it needs a special one that amazon doesn't offer. I'm rating amazon more than the product, since I can't even get the product to work...poor customer service and product control...I'd advise to buy this product somewhere else that at least supplies you with a cord to get started...or at least offers one!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"The title of this book should be ""How to make a buck off your Brothers"" This a collection of poorly printed free documents from the US patent office mostly from the 1950's. Only organic chemists can understand and have access to the chemicals and equipment necessary to do what the title claims. Pure incomprehensible garbage for the rest us. Shame on you for this exploitation!!"
1,really useless,"hii was looking for info about solvents, formulas and other interesting things on how to brew your own riods, so this seems like a good read.only ptoblem is that1. it is very hard to even read, it is a collection of old fotocopies from even older patents, it hurts the eyes.2. not a single word on brewing3. this book is on how to make the raw material for steroids, not on how to brew themfor me it was a waste of money."
3,Not that Great,"If you want a really good deck, try Onslaught's Devastation Deck or Scourge's Goblin Mob Deck."
5,How good is the odyssey theme deck well...,People say this deck is not good well i admit its not the greatest deck.But then again its not a waste of money.After about 3 to 4 months of playing i'm an expert.not from just buying theme decks i recommend buying booster packs first then go to theme decks.I have a plains deck and I put together my fire and leaf deck.I workin' on a water and swamps together the problem is getting the cardsto build another deck.In about a week i'm going to start going to friday night magic so look out! ...
2,"good, but lacks the thrill of the older sets","well though I think that new players will benifit from the use of these products ,I belive that older players will find that these decks and in general the entire expansions lack skill ,power, and strategy the game used to have. These cards and sets are an insult to the game, and anyone who uses them and cannot build there own decks and put some thought and strategy behind it should stop and play a baby game like yugi oh. For all those who don't know of what i speak, find some alpha, beta, unlimited, revised,and arabian nights cards. You gotta earn the right to call yourself a magic player."
2,its alright,Its only good for the few ok cards that are in it....Go get some real cards and add on to it...
1,WHY?,why would you want a scooter the transforms into a scooter my friend got one and he fell all the time and hes an experienced snowboarder and skier he almost got hurt this is a very silly and dangerous toy and the steering is horrid if you get this its a accident in the making
4,Works great! So easy!,"I purchased this one month ago to put a Pioneer deck into my wifes 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer. It was very, very easy. Oddly enough the markings on the packaging didn't accurately describe what each color was for, but the wires all matched up exactly to the after market connector that came with the stereo. I used the crimp method, wrapped the whole thing in electrical tape to prevent wires exposure due to rubbing, connected the black ground cable to a bold under the dash and I was done. A wonderful fit. There was only one wire that I didn't need for controlling an antenna so I just wrapped the end in some electrical tape.I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a good solution for an after market set up.BTW, Best Buy had nothing useful to offer me to do it myself."
2,Not for a mitsubishi with a factory amplifier,"I bought this to install an after market car stereo in a 1997 Mitsubishi 3000 GT SL.This piece is not the right one. It is missing the part for a connection between the car stereo and the amplifier ( 4 RCA on one side and a circular female connection on the other side) The metra brand (70 - 7003) is better as both parts come together and there is only 4 wires that need to be connected. Of course if you do not have a manufacturer installed amp. then you will be fine. Or you can use this one and then buy the second piece separately (MI03B). But the wires are more than you need to connect. As you only need power, amp, antenna and ground. I suggest you go with Metra: cheaper and easier to install."
4,Leave You Saying More,From the moment I opened the book I was in a trance until I finished it later the same day. Love Like No Tomorrow had me on the edge of my seat until I close the book. It is well worth the price.
2,Dull and boring!!,"As i read the book, i realized that Mr Hibbert was not going to give me a very good account of the Queen.He constantly talks about the Queen's changing moods, her dislikes for some of her prime ministers and her treatment of her servants.To me this things are a waste of time.Mr Hibbert fails to tells us how the Queen felt about the political situation of Europe in her time.The author very rarely mentions her views on the different wars England waged during her time. At times i felt like i was reading a gossip column on a supermarket tabloid.Mr Hibbert wastes too many chapters on things like her servants, dinner parties and the sort.The book is too tight since most of the times it covers the Queen's opinion of non-important things."
3,"Good, but a little to wordy...","I really enjoyed the book, but it gets so wordy, that it has literally put my daughters to sleep. My only wish is that he would have relied less on letting us know who people were (titles, positions, etc.) and more on Victoria's personality and life. I did enjoy her love affair with her husband!"
1,You must be ***ing kidding,"Ive seen this film on TV, taped it andI think its an alright and authentic trapper & am. native movie.Apart from that you guys must have lost your minds. The movie wasnt taht great and I wouldnt buy it for that price if the disc was solid gold!!!"
5,Great smaller knife,"Kershaw makes great knives. This mini cyclone is another fine example of good workmanship and quality steel. It is a smaller version of the cyclone. These cyclones are on e of the best assisted folders made at any price. This mini cyclone beats all the competition at this price point. You would be hard pressed to find another knife that has this quality at this price. Help our economy, this and all kershaw's are made in the USA! You will love this knife."
3,Tries Too Hard...,"I love quirk, and I watched JHC with high expectations. Though the acting was good, it was, alas, no ""Submarine"" or ""The Rage of Placid Lake"". Try those instead."
5,A really great movie,Jesus Henry Christ was a very funny movie. It kept me pleasantly entertained without being the least bit vulgar. I enjoyed it immensely.
2,Snore... snore.... snore...,"Extremely boring. Witty as all hell but its a chop-chop movie that moves from one scene to another with no warning of what happened in the last scene... it seemed unfinished.... and it goes on tooooooo long.... some scenes could have been left on the editing room floor. Others, shortened. Most of the acting is good, but I think this is a sleeper something you'd watch when you are snow in - under forty feet of snow in Alaska with a broken leg and a cathiter up your pie hole.... sleeepyville.... snore...snore....snore... two stars for the acting."
1,Oh save us from the misunderstood genius movies,"Precocious children are annoying. Movies about precocious children are horrifying and awful. Somehow Wes Anderson can pull these off, but he gives us characters who are quirky. Everyone else spews out quirks that are embodied by characters and call it a day.This movie is possibly the most egregious example of this atrocity. There is not one believable character, emotional moment or joke told well. This movie simply gives us a kid who is supposedly a genius but comes off like a pompous jerk and a lot of flashbacks to the time when his mother watched her mother burn to death at a birthday party.The fire death and its reference encapsulate this movie. The scene is played for laughs and yet it is referenced so much that it's supposedly a deep seated trauma instead of a lame joke."
1,Ms. Adam,"The ring is beautiful, but I think it is not for an adult. It is a very thin and tiny ring not what you see on the picture."
4,Excellent!,"This is a great, thorough ab workout that only takes 10 minutes. There's a warm-up that doesn't really seem necessary, especially if you do cardio beforehand. You'll work all of your abs from every imaginable angle. Kathy Ireland seems very pleasant and non-annoying; she talks for instruction purposes mostly and keeps chatter to a minimum. You can really feel your abs working hard."
5,I LOVE this band!!!,"This band kicks sooooooooooooo much ass!!! Besides Megadeth, Lacuna Coil is my favorite band! This song, ""Hevean's A Lie"" is awesome!!!! The singing alove is the worth the money of ANY LC album! Well, WTF are you waiting for? Quit reading the review and buy ALL their albums!!!!"
4,"Graham, how did you ever manage...","...to write a book from inside an urn? I wish I was you. Well, actually not...it might be rather cramped and dark in there. You've given us a book which is nothing like your written masterpiece, A LIAR'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY, but you've still managed to supply us with some great light-hearted fun. And as a true blue member of the Python Crew, that's just what we'd expect you to do. We'll never forget you, old chap...thanks for the memories; thanks for the book."
4,Great Bathroom Book!,"Short but sweet with anecdotes and inside scoop, this book is the perfect book to read in the bog or on the train, or waiting for a gall bladder operation or whatever! Very funny and touching. Rock on Graham!"
1,This is a disgrace.,"As a lifelong ""alternative"" comedy and Python fan, I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer who acknowledged this book as ""astoundingly bad"" - this book has nothing to do with Graham Chapman. It was not written by him and it does not reflect him as the keen wit or comedic genius he was. Why anyone would want to cheapen Chapman's memory with a poorly edited, ghost-written collection featuring bits of his worst material as well as completely fabricated material I do not know. It clearly isn't making them much money. I am not sure why this is not illegal.I also find it terribly low and dispicable that the author is clearly reviewing his own book. Do take a look; it's fairly obvious. I also noticed on another book by this author he had his own relative ""reviewing"" the book thus again upping the number of stars one sees when browsing for books. Don't fall for it.Track down a copy of A Liar's Autobiography instead."
1,Mediocre grave robbery,"Although Graham Chapman was a very funny and creative man, there is probably a reason why much of the material in this book has not been published before. While there is the occasional good laugh, and some of the details on the way Monty Python worked is interesting, overall it is an extremely disappointing book, particularly if you have read ""A Liar's Autobiography"". All in all, I would prefer to have my memories of Graham Chapman's creativity be based on that hilarious book, rather than this disappointing hodgepodge of miscellanea."
3,Freshness Straight Up,"Written in first person this book gives new meaning to the word ""ghostwriter""."
5,I LAUGHED UNTIL I STOPPED,"Could there be more said or uncovered about the Python troupe? Apparently so. Jim Yoakum has labored hard and well collecting and assembling details of Graham Chapman's oft times fragmented life and career. The result is too funny for print. Like the sketch about ""The World's Funniest Joke"", this book will leave you lying about feeling exhausted. Therefore it is recommended that it be read while seated or perhaps in bed. Buy it now, be laughing by lunch."
4,Lekue Ice Cube Tray,"These trays work pretty well. They are a little hard to fill because they are so flexible, and they need to be placed on a flat surface in the freezer, which is sometimes tricky. What I like about the trays is that ice is easily removed individually, and they look very pretty in drinks."
3,tough to remove cubes,"it's a struggle to remove the cubes from this tray. since it's silicone and flexible, there's no torque when you twist the tray. i end up pushing behind each cavity to release the cube."
2,Smaller than expected,"Call me stupid, but I guess I thought this was going to be a lot bigger. It says 10"" but it looks more like 5"".If it's what you're looking for... great."
4,Great but not amazing,"This is a great pad. It is the perfect size and my R.A.T 7 performs very well with it. The thickness is also just right for my preference. The only thing that didnt make it awesome was the pad moves around to much. It doesnt stick to my desk well and i usually adjust it every 15 to 20 min depending on how aggressive i play. For the Price, its a great product and i would recommend it to anyone with shallow pockets."
4,Pretty tight song,"Souljas is an ok song from Master P, but the real reason to get this is because of the song Trick Or Treat Whodi! I know the name sounds corny, but it's hella tight, it has sort of a scary beat to it like the song ""Torcher Chamber"" from TRU's 1997 album ""Tru 2 Da Game""! Trick Or Treat Whodi is not on Master P's new album Ghetto Postage, unfortunately, so that's why this single is worth getting. Check it out!"
3,Dorian has spoiled me,"I've been listening to early music primarily from the Dorian label, and I think I've been spoiled. The melodies on this album are a good selection and nicely if not spectacularly performed, on what seem to be authentic instruments; but I'd like to know more about them. Who composed them? From when do they date, in what countries did they originate? What instruments do we hear on this disc?We learn none of this. The disc has no liner notes or booklet: all that's supplied is a track list with titles, and the parenthesis ""Robertsbridge Codex"" on Track #5.I'm a little disappointed. All in all, this CD isn't for real lovers of early music, but will serve well for driving to or from the Renaissance Faire -- or as background music in a Faire dealer's booth."
2,Not a SCAdian dance album,"I've been studying and enjoying the bardic arts in the SCA for over 16 years. If your idea of medieval dance music is the stuff usually done in the SCA then you will hate this album.do they use period instruments? yes.But the songs themselves are neither pleasant to listen to nor match anything you're used to in the SCA.There's no bransles, no pavanes, none of the stuff you're likely to hear at a dance practice or event.The music is not especially festive or fun. It's not especially dancable for any form of dancing I know.At best you might like these pieces as feast background music--or a formal concert of scholarly works.It's not light, easy listening for the casual person.The title of this album really doesn't match my scheme of what medieval music is nor dance music. It's definitely not for those in the SCA besides the music laurels.The snippets really don't convey what the songs are like.I'm very disappointed."
2,you get what you pay for,This headset is cheap and you get what you pay for. After 8 months of moderate usage the microphone died and the entire headset starts falling apart.
2,Worked but not great,I was looking for a headset with mic that was light and small. This looked like it fit the bill but the extender broke about 2 months after I got them. I taped it up and it worked for about 2 years but the mic final went out so time for a new one but not this.
2,Logitech cheapchat headset,"A CHEAP product.First, my mp3 player headphones plays back better volume on my laptop than this headset.Secondly, the left side loss spound after a week.No problem with seller, and despite the low volume, I can still use the mic to chat. Not recommended."
1,Don't Buy,"Do not buy this product. For most people, the microphone will not be close enough to their mouth to pick up a decent signal. It may work better for a child. I just can't believe how bad the microphone was, and I normally love Logitech stuff. Also, the headphones wanted to clamp down on my head, but that would probably ease up over time. The headphones were a little bit bassy and not very clear at the high-end. Again, another disappointment. I will be returning this product."
1,Sucks,"SUCKS!The sounds is okay, but the Mic broke within 24 hours. The cord lays on the ground and I stepped on the cord getting out of my chair and that's all it took to break the wires. After that the microphone was complete static and white noise, it was completely unseable.It worked great until I stepped on the cord.... It should be a little more durable than that.... Guess it was only a matter of time.. because the cord was very thing and weak."
2,Crummy mic,"I have to turn the headset off my ears to put the mic in the proper spot to get a good level. The mic does swivel 180^ up and down, but it dosen't rotate right to left at all. Really crappy."
1,Came broken,"The cable was coming out of the headset. They weren't expensive by any means, but they should at least be in working condition."
5,GREAT,"not expensive, work great, are also useful for other classes even for listening to music when you accidently leave your earphones at home."
1,"Cheap, flimsy design","We bought 20 of these for our school. The mics on these never worked on our PCs. We tried to use them on applications that didn't require a mic, but they are falling apart after minimal use. The wire across the top of the headset is coming out and is fraying where it goes into the earpieaces. Tried to return them to Logitech and they wouldn't let us unless we took pictures of each headset and emailed them to them."
1,Really bad microphone,"I'm a gamer, and the only time I use my headphones is when I want to voice-chat while playing L4D2, LoL or any other game or just talk with friends.I spend most of my free time (~10h a day) on the PC, and I really wanted to get a durable mic.Long story short, it still works but the cable is so screwed up when I touch it or my hand accidentaly just touches it it makes really annoying drum sounds and static which everyone else hears and it's really annoying when you can't move your hands in order not to make this mic fail so you can't even get heard but annoy your team mates as well.Don't buy it if you plan on playing any games or using it for voicechat a long time."
3,Intrigued by other reviews,"I'm actually intrigued by a lot of the other reviews saying that they've had to shout in order to have people barely hear them/get audio recording software to recognize their voices, etc, cause I have the opposite problem: my recordings are ending up way too loud and tinny for listeners to listen to my output files for too long.I do agree with the few reviews that say the headphones do get rather uncomfortable after an extended wear, but taking them off and putting them back on a few minutes later usually fixes this."
3,"Works good, but....","This headset is comfortable and works great, but the microphone is very lose so it keeps falling down past my mouth. Also, the microphone is on the right side which is kinda strange. Most headsets I have seen or bought, the mic is on the left side."
2,Not what I expected.,"I have used lots of cheaps headsets for gaming since I figured an expensive one would break just as easily. I picked up this one thinking I would like it and I returned it the next day. The sound quality isnt all that well. I guess i'm used to the over the ear style that keeps the speakers close. My second gripe and the thing that made me really return it was that the microphone was on the right side. Some pictures even on the box showed it on other side. All headsets I have owned had it on the left side and it just felt right. Or it was fully adjustable. It just feels weird and I know I could get used to it, but I do not want to."
2,"Clear sound, but quite uncomfortable","This is the least comfortable headset I've ever used. If you don't mind your ear cartilage getting bent out of shape then this product may be for you. I don't have a huge head or anything, but I found the headset to be way too tight on my ears. The sound from the headset was fine however and the microphone seemed to work well from the limited amount of time I used the headset."
1,You get what you pay for.,"This is by far the cheapest quality headset that I've ever used. I was forced to download and use Skype for my job so I purchased this and what do you know? They break after a month of use. I returned them and assuming it was my fault that they broke, I got another pair which broke nearly a week later. For the month or so that you get out of them, the sound and microphone quality will be terrible. When I called people for work, I kept having to repeat myself because they couldn't understand what I was saying. I would never recommend these. If you can, pay the extra $20 for a pair that are better quality and more durable."
4,wonderful headset!,This item is wonderful. The on cord volume and mute mic settings are very easy to use and come in handy instead of having to use the computer to change the volume on your earphones and muting your mic. The fact that the mic can be pushed up out of your face when not in use is also wonderful makes it easier if you need to take a drink or bite of something.
1,Absolute garbage,"The microphone on this headset does not work. While testing it with some basic voice recording software, it would not pick up ANY sound short of blowing on the mic itself. What a waste of time and money!"
2,Poor Construction,I've owned two sets of these and both developed the same problem only a few months after purchase. The wiring in the volume control is poorly done and sound cuts off intermittently in the right speaker. Makes for an extremely annoying experience. Virtually any other headphones would be better than these.
2,Misleading name...,"The speakers are pretty good for the price. However the microphone is of so low quality it's ear-grading to listen too. Constant static... ""Clearchat"" might be good for you, but not the person on the other end."
4,Really Fast Service,"It was a really nice product. The service was fast, and overall just a really nice headset. Thanks so much for doing business with me."
2,Hurts my head...cheap feel,This headset feels like I'm sticking my head in a vice. Plastic ball joints (which are probably prone to breakage) squeak whenever adjusted. The boom is all plastic and not adjustable from side to side.I wouldn't want to use this for anything but an emergency substitute (which is why I'm using one now). It just feels uncomfortable and cheap.I think the other brands are a better value.
3,Good for some things not for others.,I bought this mic and got exactly what i wanted. A simple mic to use to talk on mumble and ventrillo with friends. Works very well for that application however i have been told by the people at the other end that my voice is greatly deepened. Oh well it works. One negative thing i have to say is that the wire connecting the two sides going over your head can fall out of the slides and has to be constantly put back on. Tape works wonders though. Adjusting the mic can be an adventure as its a fixed swivel so you cant move it to your mouth. This can be solved by moving one side of the size adjusters and leaveing the other alone.Overall good mic for talking to people if you want to make videos like lets plays i wouldmt recomend it because of sound quality. Good for friends not your youtube subscribers.
2,Cheap headset,I got my first one about 2 months ago at CVS for $20 and it worked fine except out of the box the mic didn't pick up my voice but i fixed that in the windows control panel. It worked well for about a month then the mic gave out and I was able to exchange it for a new one. Then that one lasted for a few weeks until the cat knocked it off my desk and onto the floor(about 3 feet) and now the mic in this one is broken. So if you are looking for a cheap temporary headset this is for you but it you want a quality one that will last you for a while look somewhere else.
4,does the job,"Had to buy one of these while in Australia. Ended up paying US$25 for it. Guess it's not much more than the regular price on Amazon.It's lightweight. minimal padding for the ears. Boom mic swings almost 180 degress. Sound is good to excellent with Skype calling. And the headset's cord length is over 6 feet which is nice. The box it came in didn't give the length and you couldn't see it due to the package material hiding it.edit 2008 - DecSadly, my dog decided they looked tasty enough to eat when I wasn't looking. I mention it only because they were still working fine since I bought them.Don't know why some people were having trouble with the mic or placement of the mic's swing arm. I write it off as personal opinion and user error."
2,Bad Microphone,"The headset itself has a perfectly decent quality fit and sound. The quality of the outgoing voice from the microphone is also acceptable...when it works.The ""when"" is the problem. This headset effectively operates the way a speakerphone does with a noise canceling feature that often cancels out MY voice as I'm trying to speak on the phone. Because the unit provides no feedback when you're talking, you can't tell what has been heard and what hasn't been heard until you figure it out from long pauses when the other party doesn't reply...or when they ask if you're still there.If it weren't for the poor microphone/noise canceling design, this probably would have been a decent product."
2,*sigh*,"This is a very solid headset for the price it is offered at. The sound quality is very good, with excellent bass.The only problem was that after a week of use, the microphone inexplicably proceeded to stop working."
1,Bad microphone,"The sound from the speakers was good and voice recorded through mic was also quite clear.Therefore, this would be a good product if the microphone had not died about 4 months after buying. I don't know why.As others have also reported, this product is not durable."
2,Dreadful,"When my old Logitech Premium headset keeled over, I sought a replacement, and came home with these. My old headset was a favorite with good sound and adequate voice capabilities. Though comparably priced, the new Clearchat headset is uncomfortable and though music has good bass response there's no high end. I mean almost none. I'm returning mine. Seems like brand loyalty is just pointless now, with varying product quality."
2,"Great sound, Horrible Microphone",I recently purchased this product for Skype calling. The sound is great on the ear phones. However the microphone is horrible. I basically have to yell for someone to hear me. I have had several other basic(cheap) stand alone microphones which were vastly superior. Just pass on this product.
3,not what I expected.,"Disappointed wih toaster. Would not recommend. toaster controls not as shown,as they are on the side of the toaster.Expected more."
3,Disappointing Price After TNG and DS9,"I have all of TNG and DS9 on DVD, and I was very dissapointed with the pricing on this set. Only 5 DVDs, and about the same price.Also, the featurettes are not as extensive as on TNG and DS9. I still enjoyed the episodes, but Paramount's taking advantage of fans on this one."
3,Something of a Disappointemnt.,"The first season of voyager was all well done, episodically. The disappointment lies in the fact that there were only 15 episodes, which shows a lack of faith in the product. It was as if the powers that be behind Star Trek made a decision to throw this out there, and see what the reaction was."
3,"Holy Paradox, Batman","It seems that with Voyager the writers of Star Trek decided to throw out all the previous history of Star Trek correctly dealing with time travel. Voyager ends up having so many time travel and paradox episodes that the writers end up coming up with a ""Temporal Prime Directive"" to help keep things interesting.Without spoiling the plot too much, the crew of Voyager participates in a time paradox by investigating an event on a planet, getting transported back in time and realizing that they cause the very event just by being stuck in the past, and then must attempt to prevent the event and restore the proper flow of time.The acting is good, but the plot is rather dry and can annoy more ""time-savvy"" viewers."
3,Trippy and Distorted,"Where is everything? Where is everyone? No Control, No Coms, No Logic! Well, it's not all that, but those are the key mysteries of this episode. Not a bad one, but not a great episode either. I did like the original sci-fi concept dreamed up for this. And hats off to the extra's in Chez Saundrine (Judy Geeson). Unfortunately the ending does not live up to its suspense build up. A definite flaw in the production and editing. I do give this 3.4 stars though. Worth watching once, but it's really not important and doesn't stand well on its own. (I can't wait for Seven of Nine, but we're a ways off from that yet) ~Keep On Trekkin'"
1,I love Voyager but only 16 episodes for 100 bucks? No way,"I am a big fan of all the Star Trek series. I have all the DS-9 and 6 of 7 Next Gen but I dont think in good conscience I can pay the normal 100 dollars for a severely shortened season. All I ask is for the greed to get turned down a notch. Please I beg you. A lot of loyal Star Trek fans are not gonna pick this season up due to the extravagent price. Other than that I have to have to say I plan to buy the other seasons of Voyager. It really was a good show. The cast really came together over the seven seasons. They started with some really good chemistry and ended with even more. I beg Paramount, please please please lower the price of this DVD."
1,"Show is great, but Amazon prime streaming video is total garbage.","Amazon streaming video NEVER works for me. The free previews of course work just fine, but if I try to watch any actual content on my prime account I constantly get generic error messages saying cant connect please try again later, or cant update player. So seemingly the player has to be updated to watch free content, yet same player works fine for previewing said content? Huh?I can stream video from anywhere else on the web, my pc is a new i7-2600k running windows 7 ultimate, and I have highspeed cable internet. I've tried disabling all firewalls and antivirus programs, but I always get the same message. Inquiries to amazon tech support results in the usual generic form letter simply stating the basic requirements of equipment. I've been usually very happy with my prime account as far as shipping, but the other touted features included in my prime account are just for marketing hype it seams."
3,disapointing surround,"I was expecting a lot about the surround sound from this set; a bit like star trek movies.After all sf is really the show to place all kinds of surround sounds.I know that the serie is not new but I was expecting a remix or sort of.Well, after seeing 2 dvds out of 5, nothing so far, everything is in the front, nothing ( or allmost) in the rear.I'm really deceived!"
1,You must be joking...,"Voyager is without a doubt, the biggest turkey in the Star Trek universe. I hoped, like alot of other Star Trek fans, that Lameager would'nt be terrible. This series started off in poor shape and then got progressively worse, forcing the producers in the following seasons to throw in Jeri Ryan in tight fitting spacesuits and the Borg - at the same time!This DVD does contain alot of extra's, you could probably find out just went wrong with Voyager by watching all the extra features but I just don't care anymore."
2,Why Why Why?,Why are the Star Trek series so outrageously priced?Any other series for tv are half this price or less.Why is that?
3,The First of Janeway's Many Temporal Incursions,"We've seen this story time, time and again. Something happens, the crew saves the day, and time is restored like nothing ever happened. So nothing at all happens in this episode, exept it is another stand-alone adventure for Voyager. The producers should have saved this for later in the season. I give it a 3.2/5 Stars on the Trek-O-Meter. ~Keep On Trekkin'!"
4,"Good, But Certainly Not Worth $100.00","Let's face it. Everybody has their favorite Star Trek Captain, and Series from the Franchise. I prefer DS9; you might prefer NTG, Voyager, or Enterprise. But the fact remains, that Paramount is hitting us with these whopping $100 price tags for these DVDs because they know that's what the market will permit. If you want to drive down the price, don't buy it on the first day, first week, or first month. Let them know that enough is enough. Unlike other TV DVD Box Sets (Buffy, ""24"", etc.), Star Trek fans tend to be compulsive junkies willing to do anything (including pay $100+ a pop) to get their fix. The rest of us regular types who enjoy the show (in reasonable doses) must pay the price for the compulsive nature of our fellow Trek fans. That said, Voyager was cool. Not my favorite, but a solid show with interesting characters. Seven of Nine was really overrated, but she doesn't even join the cast until Season 4."
3,"Started out great, then got bad","I definitely recommend purchasing the first few seasons of VOYAGER. The early episodes are fun, especially those involving Sesk and the Kazon. The Vidiians are also a great villian and the show was not as ""preachy"" as it got in later seasons. The only downside to the show is the Doc and Neelix (2 hammy actors in the vain of Data). I'm looking forward to Genvieve Bujold's deleted scenes as the captain. That alone is worth the purchase price. Enjoy VOYAGER when it was fun and before it became the 7 of 9 show."
3,Overpriced,"While I enjoy the show, I am a poor college student who does not have $100+ dollars to spend on the DVDs. Lower the price and I'll consider using the credit card."
3,I wish,"I wish I could afford to spend $100 per season. What I don't understand though is why the same set, but region 2 dvd, is the equivalent of $60 from the UK version of Amazon.. (amazon.co.uk). You use the same log in and password as on Amazon and it can be shipped internationally. So if anyone has a multi-regional DVD player get it from there, even with shipping it's got to be cheaper. The series itself is 5 star but the price sucks.Update 5-28-08: Finally this comes down to a much more reasonable price :) Love it!"
4,"Horrible packaging, but Kate Mulgrew is worth it!","If it weren't for the packaging, I'd have given this set 5 stars. It's terrible, but then the series never really seemed to be supported by TPTB as it's predecessors, TNG & DS9 so the tacky packaging should come as no surprise.It is a lot of money for 15 episodes, but remember that the first season started in January and that a couple of the episodes were held until the fall, starting with the 37's.I've not seen the special features yet, but from what I read on the box, it's well worth waiting, esp. any new footage featuring Kate Mulgrew! I look forward to seeing the next full season on DVD."
4,Third Year of Frivolous Spending!,"Wake up Star Trek geeks! Thanks to that company we know and love....Paramount...you're in for a third straight year of spending money on STAR TREK DVD'S!For 2004, you are treated to Star Trek Voyager. A worthy series introducing Trek's first female captain.I admit I am a DS9 fan at heart, but there are some great plot lines in Voyager that rival the popular TNG. I don't think all the characters in Voyager are as well rounded as DS9/TNG, but they do make for a memorable bunch.Here's to another year of Trek DVD's and all the goodness they provide!"
4,Very Expensive for a 5-Disk Set,I've been looking forward to this DVD set for years. The Voyager series is my second favorite after the Original series. All of the Star Trek DVD's have been a little high priced compared to other series and DVD packages with a few exceptions....the Special Editions of the Star Trek movies were a pleasant surprise. I noticed on Amazon's details section for this set it never did mention how many disks were included....only the small number of episodes 16....(compared to other TV series). Well after a trip to Wal-Mart the answer is 5-disks for $98 plus tax. A price of $75 for the smaller number of disks would have been fair. I will wait for the first season to drop in price before I buy. I certainly hope the later seasons are not even more expensive for the additional number of disks. The artwork on the back of the first set shows the other six seasons with probably 7 disks apiece. Thanks to Amazon for beating Wal-Mart's price but still too high for now.
3,Great Show.... Awful DVD box set,"I am and always will be a big fan of Voyager. The critics andfans alike seemed to glaze right over this series. After the Next Generation, Voyager was the best Trek made.I was expecting this box set series to at least rival what was released for DS9 and NG. What a disappointment !Awful, cheap, orange, plastic, crap. That about sums itup. It's like they didn't even want or try to take this set seriously. The discs themselves are boring with no real graphics except for an attempt at a list of episode titles.The cover is a gawdy cheap orange plastic thing that I broke trying to get it open. It needs an instruction manual just toopen the set. I haven't actually WATCHED the discs yet having just got them but the special features seem to rockby description only but I was so disappointed with the look of this set I had to give my review right away. Unless your a true Voyager fan, FORGET this set, it'll just make you feel cheated once again by viacom."
3,The packaging sucks!!!!!,"Star Trek is an awesome show and with the introduction of Voyager it gets even better. Although I am really unhappy with the packaging of the DVD's. I mean when TNG came out the boxes where nice and very protective, I mean we payed 100 dollars or more for the sets, they should be nice. Then we got DS9, they went a little cheaper for the cases, but I think they made up for it with the images on the disks. But with Voyager, come on, whats the deal. Really cheap plastic case, mine already broke, and they disks are just plain silver. Nothing on them, and you really have to look to see even whats on them. Paramount needs to take a look at what they give the folks in Europe as compaired to here in the USA, have you seen the box sets that came out over there???? Well they are nice. Please Paramount get a clue and fix this mess with the rest of the 6 seasons. I know I'm not the only one who posted a review like this...."
3,Star Trek Voyager season 1,I am a big fan of the Classics and Voyager. Voyager started out poorly. They were confronted with the Kazon far too long. It wasn't until Seven-of-Nine and the Borg did the series get interesting. Seven did to the Borg what Mr. Spock did for the Vulcan. The series really developed well after the Borg was introduced. Season four through seven were great. I give them five stars. I was sad to see the series end. It will be great to have this series in my collection of DVDs.
3,Lord Schweitzer,"Young Ensign Kim is in trouble again. The writers seem to give him the most to make a fuss about. This is a Holodeck malfunction episode. Yes, another one, as if we didn't know how much the holodecks can screw up. (I don't know why they don't deactivate them during a new science mission). Pro: The Doctor. Cons: SLOW, and definitely a ""filler"" episode that can be skipped. 3.3/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
2,Very disappointing,"I'm a big fan of this series, but I came to it late. Fortunately, that was well after this collection of stinkers aired. There are barely a handful of episodes with anything approaching original plots or concepts. Unless you are a diehard fan who'll watch anything as long as the characters wear Starfleet uniforms, I suggest you skip ahead to the fourth season or later."
4,Best of the new Star Treks,"I think Voyager ultimately became the best of the new Star Trek series. Next Generation is a close second, but Voyager was more mature. One of the best captains, and not an easy role to fill. And the last episodes of the series (season seven) is probably the best of the Star Trek movies."
2,Star Trek Voyager Season 1,"Much too expensive for the way this collection was packaged. The first season of Voyager shows the great vision that Gene Roddenberry had with his first original series, but Paramount is just seeking to milk as much money from the loyal viewers as possible. The cheap cover and lack of pamphlets make this a shameful release. Compared to the Stargate SG-1 releases, which are way more reasonable and much better packaged, the only reason I bought this was because Amazon's price was more reasonable than retail stores."
3,Finally !!,Finally ! I'll get to see Star Trek Voyager !!! Local cable did not offer a UPN or FOX channel while Voyager was being aired. ABC station carried the 1st 5 episodes and then dropped it. This will be great ! Can watch ST Enterprise and VOYAGER..like 2 new ST shows at same time ! Now just hope that ENTERPRISE will be released in a few years !
3,VOYAGER BOX SET,"This was a decent series, although I am more impressed by Deep Space Nine than any of the recent (Original Series still is untouchable) Star Trek shows.However, regardless of the extremely bright and cheerful packaging scheme, one can purchase these seasons knowing thankfully that Jeri Ryan is only a few box sets away."
2,Again this thing with the region ..,"I like the voyager series most of all and like to get the whole series, but what i still don't understand why they have this regions and not all availabel languages on one DVD. Is it really the space needed for that? I know, it's a fact, that we unfortunately have to live with that, but so I'm going to wait another couple of months to wait for region 2 with hopefully english, french _and_ german on one single DVD (set). (The region wouldn't be a problem though..)And I have to agree on the other comment, that it's still most too expensive. Would also pay a maximum of 50,- for one season.W."
3,Good show - encoding is jacked up,Gave it a 3 due to the quality of the series. Amazon has jacked up the encoding. It should have been done in HD widescreen.
5,The Best Show Ever Created,"This is not only the best Star Trek series, but it is in my opinion the best show ever created. I love this show (all seven seasons) more than most anything in life. If I were born and then watched Voyager, I would consider my life to be complete and fulfilled. I simply love it that much. I can't imagine any other show that has ever been or ever will be created that can top Voyager. Plot, character development, cast, writing, and graphics (for the time) are all perfect. One must see STV at some point in his or her life in order to have truly lived."
1,Stop the greed!,"I really enjoyed this series, but >$100.00? You have got to be kidding me! That is just incredibly greedy."
1,what *!@)$& invented this packaging?!?!,"I have all the other Star Trek DVDs and couldn't wait for Voyager. I haven't seen the DVDs yet, but the packaging is absolutely unacceptable! It's flimsy (the thickness of throw-away ""bubble-pack""), takes too many steps to take it apart, doesn't protect the DVDs properly, and is overall the stupidest thing I've ever seen. Whoever invented it should be fired and whoever made the administrative decision to use it should be boiled in oil! BOO!!!"
1,"Voyager, just wasn't all that good.","I would seriously stay away from this show if I were you. It started out promising, but the writers just didn't know how to take it to the next level, and so it stayed just a mediocre show. I have to admit, I just stopped watching around 4th season or so, it just got so boring...and I'm a complete Trek fan, I grew up on Star Trek, but Voyager just bored me to tears. I would still catch it every now and then, if I just happened to be flipping through channels and there was nothing better on, but I wouldn't make it a point to watch every single episode like I did with TNG or DS9. But anyways, that's my opinion, is that it is not worth your money."
3,Not one of my favorites,"I find all of the episodes of star trek shows worth my time, but on future runs through voyager I might skip through this one, and a few others. It's not even the worst Voyager episode either, just a bit dragging, don't feel bad if you ffwd through some of it. I like doing that to enjoy the dragging episodes better."
3,Episode 3,"If you missed this episode, you didn't miss anything. Nothing wrong with the acting, but seriously actors need something to work with. This is a writer failure."
4,Better Than I Expected,"I'm not a big fan of Kate Mulgrew's work so I didn't really have much desire to watch any of the Voyager series but when I saw that Walmart had the complete season 1 for $[...] (regular every day price, same product as here!) I decided to give it a look see. I was suprised to find I like the show a lot. Still don't care for Kate but the other characters are amazing, especially Nelix. The package materials, as others have pointed out, are CRAP. I am going to pick up season 2 at Walmart ($[...]) to see what comes next."
4,Voyager,"Being a big fan of Star Trek,I had doubts about Voyager.After all the Next Generation was very good and could not be topped.I even refused to watch Voyager because I was trying to be loyal to the Next Generation series.After two seasons of Voyager I started to watch it, simply to get my Star Trek ""fix"".I found that a female captian was really good and the shows were captivateing.I changed my mind about Voyager, but am still a Next Generation fan.I have most of the Voyager Dvds ,but they seem to be a bit expensive still."
5,Mulgrew and Crew: 'A gift that keeps on giving'.,"Like all good art, this just series just gets better with time. Kate Mulgrew and the team slaved physically and intellectually to keep up 18 hour days demanded in filming. In between, memorizing and grasping the sense of the highly challenging ""techno-babble"" as Kate Mulgrew calls it in interview and goes on to describe as Shakespearean at times in its complexity for an actor - only then to deliver the rich language both seamlessly and organically, moreover nobly and sensitively, producing the incredible result that speaks for itself and thankfully can be enjoyed just as well today. A supreme and unparalleled achievement. Even better in the re-watch for someone who only caught the occasional episode when first aired. Great to see it on Amazon Prime. (ps. cannot resist adding, I named my dog Janeway, also an escape artist.)"
5,"We should brush up on our ancient earth culture, we are about to meet our history!","Voyager comes across a trail of rust and hydrocarbon vapors in space. They find an old earth truck floating in space, how did it get into the Delta Quadrant? It is a 1936 Ford pickup truck. The truck starts on the first try and Paris turns on the radio and it picks up an SOS code. They track the source of the signal and they go to that planet to see what is going on.....This is actually my favorite episode since the first one titled the Caretaker. I found it well written and the storyline was interesting and provocative to my imagination. I do wish that there had been more time so we could have seen more details of what they had found on the planet and when you watch this episode you will understand why. This was a good plot and it was well presented. I recommend it to you as a good episode to watch."
2,The begining of the end for Trek...,"Voyager is the Trek where the producers stopped taking chances with stories and characters and started the downward spiral of the franchise as a whole.Unlike the excellent DS9, which pushed the boundries of what Trek was, Voyager was content to play things safe and dumb things down, turning Trek from an interesting exploration of the Human condition into a mindless action/T&A; show.Character development became virtually non-existant and thoughtful stories were few and far inbetween.That being said, I would probably give the first season another star (maybe even two) if it weren't so expensive. Paramount is charging the same price for Voyagers first SIXTEEN EPISODE season that they did for the 26 episode seasons of TNG and DS9."
1,So very disappointing.,"This show is an incredible disappointment. After the brilliance of TNG, this is just terrible.To be fair, it's not completely the writers' fault either. The actors in this show are just....terrible. TERRIBLE! (Neelix and the doctor are played by decent actors, but their characters are chalkboard-gratingly annoying. Especially Neelix.) This show is so poorly cast as to make it unwatchable."
1,C'Mon People,"Voyager sucked harder than a hull breach on Deck 5!!!Can anyone honestly say they felt like they got to know any of the characters in their seven year ""journey""?Did the crew learn anything on their voyage except that every space-faring race in the Delta-Quadrant always happened to have spare dilithium and deuterium when they were running out?Far-scape and Babylon 5 are much better written. As a matter of fact, I'd love to see Lameway and her crew go toe to toe with the Shadows any day!"
3,Poorly packaged.,Another very disappointing packaging effort by Paramount. I suggest that they have a look at the wonderful packaging of the Babylon 5 series sets and get it right.This ST:Voyager set comes in a flimsy plastic box and you have to take the plastic top off and then take the plastic bottom off to get at the DVD's.This leaves the set open to dust and(unless you have three hands)you must put both plastic parts down to remove a DVD and then put these three bits back together.Truly terrible packaging!The DVD picture of the series is eccellent and it was interesting to see the Bujold footage. She was obviously too old for the role and her French accent grates a bit. What Rick Berman doesn't mention is that he made the huge mistake of giving Bujold the role without an audition.The DVD of the season is good but they need to correct the awful packaging.
3,"The Voyager Misfits .. Larry, Curly, Moe, and Tuvoc","I've seen Star Trek Voyager at least 4 times through now. And, although this episode is memorable, I wanted to skip ahead through some predictable plot points that don't mean much. But I get what they were trying to do. 3.7/5 Stars. Cause I know that if you've never seen this episode (or only once), you'll love it. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,Vidian Abductors,"B'Elana is split in 2! It's a memorable episode from season 1, and good character development for the Klingon. Cons: It was predictable, and slow at the end. But worth watching. 4.0/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,Another Star Trek Murder Mystery,"Murder! Someone murdered an alien doctor, and Tom Paris is the prime suspect. It has the Sci-Fi, but the timing was kind of slow for Voyager. It could have been worse though. An average DSV episode. I give it 3.4/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,The packaging is completely disrespectful to fans!!!,"I am a lover of this series and have been waiting for so long to collect Voyager on DVD. I received in the mail today what must be the biggest let down that Star Trek has ever delivered. A see-through orange plastic case that holds the dvd's. There are no inserts, no pictures on the dvd's, and the case splits into two in a way that is very awkward. I paid $90.00 for this??!!I so hope the Voyager people read these reviews because I will not give them anymore of my money unless they improve their product. I feel so disrespected as a fan of this series. Packaging may not seem like a big deal, but when you compare it to the TNG dvd's - the difference is night and day."
3,Rookie mistake; don't muddle the chain of command,"I love Star Trek and I've been watching all the films and franchises since I was a kid, but there are a few sticking points that I'll probably never get over.One such peeve relates to the fact that the greatest characters in Star Trek, from Kirk to Picard to Sisko, are warriors, and yet, their Federation doesn't behave like an organization with military force at its disposal. Unethical and unprofessional relationships between superior officers and their subordinates is just asking for trouble and that's why armed forces in the present day tend to legally discourage such problematic relationships."
1,Voyager,"For a pilot, I thought it was pretty good. It will take time to develop the characters, but Muldrew is definitely easy on the eyes, has a gravelly voice reminds me of Kathryn Hepburn. She is a little too stiff in this episode, but it's the first time out in her role as Captain. I don't know who the blonde was, but she is drop dead gorgeous. I have never seen any of this series, so anxious to see where it goes. The sound is excellent, unlike many other shows I have watched on Amazon. Wish they had CC though. For a first show, I would have to give it a five star rating, hope I won't be disappointed in what comes next."
1,Time to take a stand,"Rather hard to give this DVD a rating since I haven't opened it yet.Having read most of the reviews on Amazon about substandard packaging. Helped me reach this decision, the fans of STV are being ripped off.1 poor DVD case2 no labels on DVDs3 only 15 shows [yes the show did start in Jan]4 Prices range from $84.99 to $119.99 per set brand new.[same price as the full season of shows]First thing tomorrow I will be returning my set for a full refund. Maybe this will help send a message to Star Trek organization. We are willing to pay the price but in return we expect to have a quality item"
3,packaging,As a star trek fan from the beginning I would expect to pay a little more to collect this franchise. But when your willing to pay a little more you should expect a little more as far as the product goes. The packaging on this is as cheap as it gets! So buyer beware! Count your discs and hold them up to check for scratches!
3,Not so Quiet,"Interesting, personal account of WWI, as seen by a female ambulance driver. Author negatively describes the WWI nastiness as a contrast to Hemingway's romancing of it. Not in Hemmingway's league, but gives a distinct feminine snapshot of that period of time. 3 stars"
1,Horrible!,"When will it end?! Rap artists couldn't stop after they obliterated whatever small goodness was in original rap music, but now it seems all any rap artists can do to have a hit is ""remix"" - and by that I mean destroy - an already good song made by someone else. This is awful awful awful, and if I were Tim McGraw I'd sue for slander."
2,Caution: John Sebastian Lovers Only,"I was delighted to find that this album is available once again. I saw John perform back in the early 1970's and immediately went out and bought this record. The sound quality is not that great and the singing is uneven, but if you've ever seen Sebastian perform in person, it might be worth your while. He could, and probably still can, entertain a crowd. As the saying goes, ""You Had To Be There"" in order to fully enjoy this cheapo, cheapo production."
4,Sabastian Live,"One of the great Acoustic/Singer/Songwriter live albums. The gentleness of his smile can be seen with your eyes closed, and heard with every word he sings."
5,A Fabulous Guide,"I was a bit skeptical of this book at first. Why a book just for women?However, I heard Sbrocco speak and I was converted. Boy does she know her stuff. In person, she is a dynamic and intelligent speaker filled with so much knowledge about wine. And that translates to her book.I learned so much from this book. Yes the information imparted is relevant to both genders. However, in the end, if you learn, who cares?This book works for both the novice and for someone with a basic knowledge of wine. I knew, for example, that if you like chardonnay, you'll most likely favor chablis. however, I didn't know the differences between the left and right banks of certain regions in France or the emerging importance of New Zealand wines.I have given this book as a gift to half a dozen people. They all loved it. You will too!"
4,"I liked the story line, but","While I enjoyed the story lines of the first 2 books, the similes get tiresome after a while. I will likely read the rest of the The Witness Series."
5,Excellent ebook,This ebook was a good buy and also an excellent read. I can't wait to read the next book in this series.
3,Easy Read,"An easy read that keeps you interested, however now having read 3 of the ""Witness"" series they are becoming predictable"
4,AMAZING!,"Once again, I'm in love with Josie Bates. Though sometimes I feel she seems a bit too detached from hannah, i've come to respect this story line. At least it feels real. I read some reviews prior to purchasing this second book, i LOVED the first. Some reviews said that Archer was a hard character to like. I'm not going to lie it was a little difficult to sympathize with him at any level, but the fact that Josie was so passionate really helped even it out. If you loved the first book I'd recommend to buy this one and the next two. YOU WONT REGRET IT!"
4,Hooked on the series,"This first of the ""witness"" series held my interest and got me to order the next few books featuring Josie Baylor-Bates!"
3,entertaining,"silent witness is the second of a series for the ""adventures of josie bates.""for me, the first installment was more fun to read, but that's not to say that this one is that bad.halfway through the book, an idea popped into my mind as to who probably is the ""culprit."" and i was right. but in spite of that, i held on and i was still happy with how things turned out.as with the first book, typos were scattered throughout the book coupled with the need for some editing.still, i was able to get the story and will still be reading the next two."
4,surprising mystery,"the characters are okay in this book, the story is good but it just isn't quite a 5 star, it is not one that you will sit up that extra hour at night to read."
4,Very good read,"This is my second book I read from Rebecca, very good thriller but missing all the around the corner surprises. This is why I give this book a 4, if we could I would give it a 4.5. Looking forward to read my third book from Rebecca."
4,Silent Witness Exceeds Hostile Witness,"Silent Witness is a great addition to the Witness series. In many ways, I feel it was better than Hostile Witness. You have already been introduced to the characters so you are able to focus more on the story. I also feel that the story line was just more interesting. And the new characters added in this book were more enjoyable to read about than in book one.I am not going to provide a book description as that was outlined in the editorial review but if liked Hostile Witness you must read Silent Witness."
4,Entertaining,"I would describe the book as entertaining, easy to read. At the beginning it seemed a very elaborate, of intricate story, but in the end it turned out to be a very simple way to solve the trouble. Not very elaborate though."
4,solid effort,"Plot believable enough to be enjoyable, characters are being developed as series continues, a fast read. I'd buy the rest of the series if it went on special, but probably not at full price."
4,Silent Witness by Rebecca Forster,I found this author by accident when I was looking for my first e-book to download to my brand new Kindle. I enjoyed the first Witness book so much so that i purchased this second one. I have not been disappointed - good plot and surprise ending. Sent an email to the author from her website and received (what appeared to be) a personal reply! Am now reading #3 and have purchased #4. Enough said! JB
4,Silent Witness - Action Packed,This book was an action packed fast read that keeps your attention with every turn of the page!! I've already purchased other books by Rebecca Forster and can't wait to get started.Silent Witness (Signet Novel)
4,Good thriller but not too intense,I enjoyed this book but it wasn't a page turner for me. I liked the continuation of the characters from the first book and the story line. It was a good read even though I wasn't on the edge of my seat.
5,"""Silent"" sequel ""Screams"" success!","Ms. Forster has done it again. Totally captivating story and blend of characters, both old and new. Just when you think you have figured it out, it twists and turns another direction. Josie, Archer, Hannah---the gang's all there but they come with new friends and foes, complications, successes, pain and emotions and then she throws in the intrigue of a Theme Park, setting the scene with the joys of the young at heart and the horror of something that can go terribly wrong. Read this book. You will not be disappointed and you will do as I did---ordered all the rest in this Thriller Series! There are many talented writers out there in the world. Rebecca Forster is at the top of that list. Treat yourself to her books and see for yourself. I am glad I did!"
5,Best book I have read in a long time!,"This book is a second in a series of three books. The first book was Hostile Witness and Silent Witness is the second book and it was great. The characters Josie, Hannah, and Archer continue from Hostile Witness. These are legal thrillers and are too great to put down. This is the best book I have read in a long time. In addition, Rebecca Forster is a wonderful person and a great writer. Enjoy the adventure!"
3,A disappointment after the first book,"I enjoyed the first book in this series, which was free, so I decided to spend the money on the second in the series. I was disappointed in this book. First of all, the relationship between Josie (the heroine) and Archer (her possibly murderous boyfriend) was just plain annoying. Archer is downright hostile; Josie wants everything her way, and everyone else can follow her (or not). Second, the way Josie treated her teen ward Hannah really rubbed me the wrong way.The storyline was compelling, but I found the execution lacking and the characters unlikeable. I actually quite enjoyed Hostile Witness, so Silent Witness was a bit of a letdown."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"So happy with my second choice book and hopefully the third one is just as great, thank you.! loved it !"
3,Silent witness,Took some good twists and turns. I had it figured out about three quarters of the way through but was still very interested. She always creates good characters and there were some great ones in this book. If you liked hostile witnessing is great too.
5,Rebecca hits it out of the park again!! MUST READ!,"Book two in the WITNESS SERIES and another winner for Rebecca Forster! Josie, the lawyer we've all come to love and admire, is back and she is fighting for her life...her love...her world -- will she succeed in the end or will she uncover a truth so devastating it will tear her apart? This story takes unexpected twists and turns from page one to the final page. As I read this story I found myself experiencing a broad range of emotions from hope, love, guilt, shame, fear and anything in between. Rebecca brings her characters to life and they can't help but imprint on you. I LOVED THIS STORY!!"
2,Silent Witness,Again a good time filler. For crime / detective story its ok. Unfortunately her books all seem to have the same theme.
2,slow moving,i found this book way slow moving and extremely repetitive...i almost stopped reading it halfway through...i did find the ending was what i did not expect...
2,A Pathetic Read,"Even though this book is a cheapie, it is vastly overrated by many reviewers. Much of the description is juvenille and irrelevant to the story line"
3,it's missing suspense,"Almost a good read, but if you have the prior witness book by Forster, you will know the outcome. Liked the transition with Hannah."
5,My Other Favorite,"The Spanish Bride is the fictionalized history of two very real individuals, Brigade-Major Harry Smith and 14 year old Juana who he rescued and married after the Siege of Badajos. Love at first sight for both of them, the story reads like a novel. It follows them through Wellington's campaigne through Portugal, Spain and southern France. It ends with their reunion on the battlefield after Waterloo.One of two books dealing with the Napoleonic Wars in which battles are described so accurately they have been used by the English Public School System, Georgette Heyer proved beyond doubt her mastery of historic detail."
2,A historically interesting yet boring book,"I've been a reader of Georgette Heyer books for quite some time now and I adored most of her novels. However, I was really disappointed with this one. If you expect a traditional Heyer novel, you also will not like it very much. The story is boring and I really had a hard time continuing the book. However, if you're intersted in history, and especially in English history at Lord Wellington's time then you probably will enjoy the novel very much, because Heyer gives a very specific account of the war on the Iberian peninsula against the French. Nervertheless, it is not a novel that I would recommend."
4,the spanish bride,"Has a lot of war details that I admit, I just skipped but it is a great love story that really happened"
5,One of Her Best,"Georgette Heyer has given enourmous attention to the historical facts that form the backdrop for an engaging romance. It is the Napoleonic era, and the war on the Peninsula is making widows and orphans. One such orphan finds her destiny with an audacious British officer."
3,Not her best,I have enjoined many of Heyer's novels but this one not so much. Lots of historical context but essentially one battle to the next with a thin plot
3,"Wrong color, missing pockets, but still roomy!","At the time of my purchase, the image accompanying this product showed a tan/black color pattern. The bag that arrived, however, was a blue/black color pattern.I've owned these in the past and it seems CLC is removing some of the inner pockets. Used to come with 2 inside each end, and about 3 on either side. Aside from the misrepresented color and lack of pockets compared to older versions, I'd say this bag makes a decent soft-sided toolbox for the price."
1,Worthless on my 2 vehicles,"Wouldn't stick on my 2 vehicle ('95 4runner and 2000 Jetta), maybe because of the curved windshield. Bought the bean bag and am very happy with that. It's the way to go IMHO. You can than hide it when you leave the car leaving no telltale apparatus to tempt thieves."
5,Suction mount,"Exactly as the original, swivel and suction design well thought out, excellent functionality. The 12V adaptor could use an L-bend or freely swiveling base."
2,So soon?,"This is the same mount type that shipped with my Garmin nuvi when first purchased. It had been stolen from my car in a smash and grab. I was happy to finally replace it and not rely on the little towel set up that I came up with. Within a week the suction mount has ceased to...suck. Or rather, it does suck, but not in the way intended. It just keeps falling off after 3 min of press down. I do not keep it on when I leave the car so as to avoid another theft and excess heat. I am disappointed, but It has to be a ""one off"" defect as this model mount had worked well in the past. Back to the silly towel improvisation. I have not tried to return this item yet."
1,Suction stopped working,I have had the original suction cup for Nuvi 660 GPS since Oct 2008. The last few trips I would get it to stick on the windshield of my Honda CRV but as I started driving it would fall off. I had a garmin a few years back that would do the same thing. You would think that they would improve the suction as the they improve the technology. I guess not. I am looking for other options for mounting my GPS in my car. I otherwise love my Garmin Nuvi.Update to review: I have since bought the dash sandbag gps holder and it is only thing that I have found that keeps the GPS in place and not falling out of sight and also can be moved around easily as needed. I would never go back to the suction cups on windshield.
2,Durability,"I've owned a NUVI 660 for some years and have been happy with the unit itself. However, the 12V car adapter and the Suction Cup Unit {power end) are a different story. Much care must be taken when using these items especially by car users who install and remove the NUVI frequently in their vehicles. As you will note from the previous reviews the non NUVI attachments are very prone to break and mine have had to be replaced as well. The replacement suction cup mount and car charger are thankfully not that expensive. My power cable partially detached from the mounting unit, the suction cup holder inner part broke and would not hold the NUVI in place and the 12V plug-in detached in the cigarette lighter socket blowing the car fuse and taking the detached end out destroyed my cigarette lighter socket as it had jammed there.The unit is treated with care as I use it for both city and long distance traveling and its use is essential to me. Good luck."
4,The author of Jazz Guitar Soloing speaks:,"Hi. I'm Bob Patterson, founder of jazzguitar.com. I wrote this book for the player who knows his guitar and can get around pretty well, yet does not know the Jazz language. I make complicated ideas simple and easy to absorb, and present exercises and workouts that train the fingers in speaking Jazz, so that the creative mind can think up ideas, and the hands can execute them. I think this book will launch you on your journey in Jazz. happy playing!Bob Patterson"
5,A great help for both new and experienced educators,"I have been teaching art to children for nearly 7 years now, as well as having had my own fifth grade homeroom for 4 years, and this book is still a great resource. I bought it because I had borrowed it from another art educator and found it too helpful to miss. Some are new tips, some reminders, and loads of great projects. My only complaint is that the student work examples were horribly photographed and are often too dark and thus disappointing but still somewhat readable. Knowing this, I still bought it for the great content."
5,great resource,This book came at the perfect time. I am a first year art teacher at a K-8 school. I was looking for activities to keep my 7th and 8th graders interested and this book is providing so much more. The information is very helpful for me as well as a resource for the classroom teachers I work with.
1,Art book review,I was very disapointed with this book. All of the pages are photocopied in black and white. There is very low resolution on the images and an art book in black and white is worthless for most aspects of class. There were a few projects that were appropriate but it was hardly worth the investment.
5,A great resource for teachers (especially new ones!),"This book was recommended to me by a classmate who has been an art teacher for 7 years. Her copy is tattered, wrinkled and obviously well used and well loved. I ordered it to help me brainstorm units and organize my new classroom.A lot of the 125 student projects are pretty corny but provide jumping off points for creating your own fabulous lessons. I really like some of the interdisciplinary connections Hume lists and think they will help me in collaborating with the general ed teachers in my school.Hume also lists several educational games that can be purchased or created by you for an art classroom - what a wonderful idea for substitute days!"
1,Not keeping with the title...,"This book was written for a University Professor, not a busy public school-teacher, with freshman-college-aged students, not little kids. If this is the author's idea of Elementary School Art, I can only imagine what her Secondary School book is like. Great book, just not keeping with the title."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,Yes I suppose this was mildly helpful but it is a big book and the ideas aren't great. You're better off asking a veteran teacher what you need to know.
4,Must have for the elementary art teacher!,"If you teach art to kids then this book is definately a must have for you! Although it involves more of a general overview of what age groups should be at as far as learning skills and techniques, it does give some great general ideas as far as projects for the elementary grades! Great for a teacher just starting out and looking for resources!"
2,"Great band, but studio versions are better","This was one of my favorite bands in the 70's. I caught them live several times as the backing band for Yes and Jethro Tull. I do not know why they call this release a box set. It does have 2 CD's, however it is packaged in a single cd sized holder (wheres the box?) These are live recordings from the BBC, the first CD was recorded in '73, the other CD was recorded in '78. I was hoping to replace my old scratched up LP's with this, but it is no substitute for the studio versions. I would only suggest purchasing this CD if you already own Free Hand, Power and he Glory, etc. and want to hear what this band can do live. Some of the songs are not the best, there is even microphone feedback. This CD does not capture the true live quality of the band. JJ Mackey"
2,MONOPOLY T-SHIRT,"Disappointing. Wish they produced adult sizes or larger ones. Quality disappointing!! Love the idea, however. Larger sizes would result in increased sales for sure!"
1,Never received item,"Gave low rating only due to never receiving the item. My nephew wanted as a gift. Oh well, he must of tried it and thought it was good enough to ask for it."
4,Thrilled,"Finally a skate game that is somewhat realistic. EA Skate is definitely the best skateboard video game ever made. This game would make all of the Tony Hawk games look childish. Every skaters are equal, there are no stats, you've just gotta know how to trigger your tricks."
5,Skate rocks!,skate is a very fun game and is way better than the Tony Hawk games because its like real life but in the tony hawk games you can do anything wich gets boooorrriiinnnggg! I can't wait to buy skate 2 wich will probably be alot better. I hope everybody enjoys this game and happy skating!
4,Skate,"My son loves this game and is anxiously awaiting its sequel Skate II due out in the next couple of months. I am amazed by the detail and graphics...it also teaches you by ""real voice"" commands from a professional skate boarder how to actually do these tricks. It also shows you what happens if your atempt fails, which is very important for young people to see!!"
2,Not as pictured,"I have ordered these in the past, and they arrived looking just as pictured, but the packaging has changed. It now contains fewer pieces than shown and does not keep them in place during shipping, so they arrived all jumbled and tossed around, looking much worse for the wear, and not at all suitable for gift giving."
4,Made a Wonderful Gift!,"The box of chocolate covered cherries was purchased as a ""surprise"" gift for an old friend. Their reaction was wonderful!They said the package was in perfect condition upon arrival and the chocolate covered cherry cordials were just right in regard to sweetness and flavor. They were most grateful for this gift."
4,Inspiring new techniques,"Digital Art Studio: Techniques for Combining Inkjet Printing with Traditional Art Materials provides a wide range of interesting and creative techniques for digital imaging that I anticipate will help me to move beyond making simple digital prints that all look exactly alike to creating unique, one of a kind originals. Be warned that some of them require some very specialized materials that aren't cheap or easy to locate, but I anticipate that, for me personally, the results will be worth the effort and I hope will take my work to a new level."
5,Digital Art Studio,"I recommend this book for all those interested in digital art.This book defines the process,equipment,ink,canvas or paper needed to produce quality digital art output."
3,Fine for Beginners,"This book should be described better. It is a beginner's guide to sudoku, with many of the usual suggestions. Except by inviting the solver to use trial-and-error at a level that is too easy to require it, it does not really present any sort of new or different approach.Some, especially beginners, may find the number-by-number solving instructions helpful. The author does walk through the basic rules of sudoku very straightforwardly. Still, the book stops far short of any serious solving techniques. If the author's ""fifteen steps"" help to solve hard puzzles, he has not shown me how they do it."
3,missing some of the songs from the movie,"This cd would have been alot better if they would have included Marilyn Manson's ""Disposable Teens"" and Poe's ""Haunted"", but some how they screwed that up. Don't get me wrong, it's an ok cd, but it's just not the same without the other two. But anyways, my favorites are Lie Down, Mind, Stick It Up, Suicide Is Painless, PS, Old Enough, & Feel Good Hit Of The Summer. My only complaint is, why is Stick It Up edited?! That really makes me mad. Oh well, I guess the cd was worth it. I've had the cd since it came out, and since then I have probably bought all of the albums from the more famous bands on it. So you might like the actual bands' albums better. I think I do. That's all."
3,Something Missing,"I enjoyed the movie, and thought that the soundtrack would be just as enjoyable. While overall the soundtrack is o.k., I think there are some obvious things missing. No sound bytes, dialog, from the movie (the first ""soundtrack"" had them). Three major songs are missing, most notably ""Disposable Teens"" by Marilyn Manson and ""Haunted"" by Poe. Songs that were only heard in the credits are on here, but not the opening shot song (Disposable Teens), or the sexy ""Haunted.""I would give the BW2 soundtrack an overall O.K. It is enjoyable, but I feel like the essence of the movie is totally missed by leaving out three songs (the third being from Death in Vegas) and from a lack of sound clips. Just be sure to look at the artists on here. If you like them, and don't have the songs included, then go for it. But if you have these songs (how many copies of ""Dragula"" do you really need?) don't bother with this mediocre compilation."
5,Book of Shadows:Blair Witch 2 soundtrack,"This is some of the best music I've ever heard. This soundtrack is killer. The best song is the last song - Feel Good Hit for the Summer by Queens of the Stone Age. That song makes me bang my head and go wild. If you don't buy this soundtrack, at least download that song. You'll love it!"
2,Never really gets into you,"I bought the soundtrack as a Marilyn Manson fan, but i was dissapointed. The real highlight is Manson's cover of Suicide Is Painless, a track that sounds pretty dark and depressing and is actually very emotional. The rest of the CD is as forgettable as the movie - although that Dark chick is really beautiful, but that doesn't make a movie -. Godhead's song is OK but nothing quite exceptional. I don't see Manson's influence in this CD. And how many times will we have to listen to Dragula in a sountrack. It's becoming a cliche."
3,Decent,"This book has pretty good coverage of topics: Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets.The information is pretty complete, but could be organized better.My main complaint is that there is no table of cases. This is a pretty serious ommission from a law book. No table of statutes, either. And the index is pretty sucky too - no entries for ""cybersquatting"", ""GATT"", ""Licensing"", ""genericide"" - I won't go on, but I could."
2,"Eh, kinda disappointed.","This to me is just an average towel. Absolutely nothing special about. I suppose I just wanted it to be softer or bigger, Ill research more next time."
3,Not so good,"I really don't like this citypack, it has a nice map, and nice pictures, but the ""Itinaries"" are only two, and of two hours each one, so I dont think for ""Itinaries"" it can be usefull, it has a really good size, and the Top 25 is excelent"
4,Delightful,"I had some doubts about this one, but I needn't have. This opera is entertaining, as I assume it was meant to be. It is well performed. Sets and costumes are extremely good, and it's fun to watch and listen to. The sound and picture quality are good. If you like Lakme or like listening to French ballet music of the time, you'll like this"
4,Math to Build On,"This is a good book for those of us who haven't been using math on a regular basis for building. Also a lot of entry level job tests contain math, this book is good for brushing up on rusty skills, or helping build new ones. It has tests, practices and memory aids. It is mostly US measurments but also contains a chapter on Metrics. This book is focused on the skills used in the building trades. I found it helpful and easy to work with."
4,Great massage tool!,These balls work very well to stimulate and relax muscles. They are especially good for rolling under your feet after a day of standing or walking. The pictures might lead one to believe that these balls have give but they do not. They are hard plastic and may take some getting used to but that is typical of this type of trigger point massage tool. Take it easy and apply your weight as it is comfortable and you'll enjoy these massage balls.
2,Don't Recommend,This machine worked fine for about 6-8 months but after that it just began to be one problem after another. The thread gets caught in the tensioner and begins to sew microscopic stitches and then quits. Wouldn't recommend.
3,just okay,"So far this is just an 'okay' sewing machine; definitely NOT great!!! The straight and zig-zag stitches are fine....but the other stitches just won't work! I've tried all I know to get them to work but NO LUCK.Will have to take it to my local Singer shop to have them look at this. Which is very frustrating!!Thankfully, it's still under warranty!"
5,price match the quality...i like it...,"well, if you guys want a better product, you might spend money more for it...so, you can't expect a machine with middle price with ultra high quality and functions unless you are lucky or the maker are generous...when i bought this machine, i got training from the seller about how to use this and that...so i don't have to waste my time with the book...but for some more function, i still refer to the book...i tried the functions...it worked...no problem...i wonder what's going on if it doesn't work since it's not electronic digital function...i think this machine got rebuild now so i got the unbroken one or other reviewers just got a bad new machine...for me...i got what i want with the price...if i want more of quality...i would definitely buy one of singer 9000 series...(^o^)..."
2,Singer 2662,"While this sewing machine arrived in a extremely prompt 2 days after ordering I was extremely disappointed with it's performance. It was loud, making almost grinding noises when sewing a basic stitch, and didn't seem to sew very smoothly. The knobs to change the stitch settings didn't moving smoothly either. Then when I lowered the feed dog with the handy lever, something inside the machine broke and the feed dog would not go back up. Needless to say I promptly returned this machine. I don't think I would recommend a Singer from here on out. My new machine of a different brand has been incredible!"
5,Best Machine for the Money,"I have had this machine for 9 years. I sew daily and use it for alterations as well as garment construction. I LOVE this machine. I have 2 other sewing machines including a brand new Singer Futura Embroidery machine and this one is still my go to machine for everyday jobs that I don't need a serger or embroidery machine for. It's quiet, sturdy and has lasted through some really tough jobs. I don't use the decorative stitches too often other than ZigZag but I do get quite a bit of use from the stretch stitch and automatic buttonhole function. I've only had to replace the belt and rubber wheel on the self-winding bobbin once and that was last year. Simple, I ordered the parts online and installed them myself since they were easy to access and replace. I've used Viking machines, Brothers and Janomes and still love this one."
5,Quality bike,"Excellent quality bike that was very well packaged.. sent direct from manufacturer. The ""nuts and bolts"" were well organized and it was relatively easy to set up. Substantial feel to the bike with good variety of programs. Nice built in speakers for music."
5,Nice Bike for the Price,"The bike was easy to assemble and it is easy to use. The pedal straps a hard to adjust, but other than that the bike works as it should and delivers an excellent workout. The machine is solidly built as well and all the pieces and tools come with the package."
1,Really a letdown,"This game might look fun, but after buying it for my sister I realized that it definitely isn't. It comes with an unbelievable instruction booklet that would take a month to learn, and even after going through the game slowly and following along in the instructions, my younger sister and I both found this game disappointing and very boring and it has found its permanent resting place in the back of her closet.Even if you're a true Harry Potter fan like us, take my advice and don't waste your money on it."
1,What's the point????,"When I got this game for my my birthday, I could hardly wait to play, I thought wow!-is this going to be fun!!!Boy, was I ever wrong. First of all there's the set up-you have to punch out the pieces piece by peice. Then there's the actual game-what's the point of this game???? Some of the objects of the game are just so pointless! ..."
2,Purchase,I was considering getting this game for a present at christmas for my Granddaughter. I decided not to as a result of the reviews. I want to get a game the entire family can play. It sounded to me like if everyone was not familiar with all the books and did not know all the game rules it would not be enjoyable.
1,A game without an object,"When I purchased this game for my son, I was looking forward to playing it many times with him. With the ""Harry Potter "" name on it, how could I go wrong ? We were very disappointed when, upon playing the game, we discovered that it had no object, was laborious to set up, and took a very long time to play for what was accomplished. Surely the developers of this game fell asleep when they played it ... or maybe no-one gave it a test-run !"
1,"Six and three quarters? Not worth a dime,","Yes, this has the fabulous Harry Potter logo on it. I certainly hope I never have to see something of this nature come from that name again. I will not believe that this is something JKR approved of. (Did you warn her when she gave movie rights?) The game(s) are insulting to anyone with any IQ over three, but the simplicity of the games is only understood if you can wade your way through the instructions. I finally did, and couldn't believe it was THAT simple. I hope this is scathing enough to keep anyone from wasting their money or their time."
2,Confusing,You have to read too many directions to play all of the games. At times the games are a bit confusing. The Diagon Alley Board Game is A LOT more fun!!!
2,Dissapointing,"I am a very big harry potter fan and when I saw this game, I told my parents to get it for me for christmas. It was christmas day and i got it. I was already to play it. I opened the box and what did I see. Cheap old cardboard pieces. I put it together and read the rules. Then I played it with my brother. Worst game I ever got. Dont buy it."
2,The game,"The game was not the greatest ever, it had its ups and its downs. The instructions were very confusing, we had a few laughs because the instructions were so confusing we really did not know what to do. It was a little fun at first, but then it sort of dragged on. Towards the end it was just kinda like ""IS THE GAME ALMOST OVER!"" But then again it was sort of suspensful which was why we did not stop playing. It can help you learn to eliminate things. I would give this game 2-2 and a half stars."
2,Rushed to Market with Poor Instructions,"The Harry Potter name and books are magical. The game should be too, but it's not. The game consists of challenges (or games within the game), each with it's own set of poorly written instructions. For most of these mini-games, we needed to make up numerous rules along the way, because the instructions are simply insufficient. As a result, players will spend more time reading and interpreting the rather lengthly instruction manual, than they ever will spend playing the game. The six challenges range from fairly standard memory or matching games to modified chess. My guess is that most people will begin wondering early on ""when will this game ever end"" and once it ends exile it to the game closet to gather dust. My bottom line is - keep reading the books but don't buy the game."
3,This game had confusing instructions!,"... Hi! My older sister and I got this game for my little sister for Christmas. We were so excited to play it with my mom and little sister! Then, we started the game and found out how confusing and incomplete the directions are! I was beginning to think we should have gotten a different Harry Potter game! My 'lil' sis seemed very dissappointed and so were we! We haven't played the game since and we are Harry Potter fanatics! I think maybe it will be more fun if we play this game when there are better instructions! I read them again and it made more sense to me, but my family still won't play it with me!"
1,Book does not match the hype!,"This book is more like a magazine being only 131 pages long, with one chapter dedicated to the authors own consulting business, plus dozens of pages listing job websites. Sad to say this ""book"" does not match the hype the author has plastered over Amazon!"
1,Key here is 131 pages,"What can you say about a book that has dozens of pages of website addresses, 10 small articles, and a Chapter devoted to selling the authors own consulting business - all within 131 pages?"
2,Piece O' Crap,"This product replacement plan has been a HUGE headache: when my daughter's MP3 player stopped working THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS, we called right away to find out how to get the replacement. After ages on hold--and I am a very patient woman, so I do mean AGES--we were told to take our contract to Best Buy for a replacement. Little did we know that the three Best Buy stores in our immediate area would have no record of any such agreement. When we called back--and stayed on hold again for ages--we found out that there, indeed, is no such contract. Instead, we have to go through a lengthy process via snail mail to get a replacement. Yep--you guessed it. This contract is useless. Do not waste your money."
5,service plan,"I have not used this product yet and hope I never have to but I thought it would be a good idea since the product I purchase was refurbished. If I ever have to use the service plan, I will write another review."
3,It was nice to have but lucky didn't have to use.,Getting the paper work and all taken care of was easy and all and it was nice that I didn't have to worry about my stuff breakign them me being out a nice chunk of change.hopefully I will never have to use one of these replacement plans but it's nice to have as a back up cause you just never know.
4,Highly neglected little gemm.,"""Une Education Manquee"" is one act comedy by Emmanuel Chabrier very witty, well performed, about a young just married couple who have a problem with their wedding night untill a horrendous thunder throws them into each other's arms. The melodious score enhences the charm of the work. I recommend it for anyone who chooses to add it to their operatic knowledge.Joe Neustatl"
3,"Wonderful music, mediocre DVD","Chabrier's music is effervescent, constantly entertaining, the DVD unfortunately mediocre, the sound fuzzy, the color almost non-existent and instead of two sopranos singing husband and wife the producers have substituted a tenor. It would have been much wittier if left the way Chabrier intended it. Incidentally, Chabrier never heard the work performed with his orchestration during his lifetime--he only played it with piano for a few delighted men (he was a good friend of Manet's). The two soprano version is available on CD. If you need some minimal visuals this DVD will have to do."
4,Great book for beginner readers,"This book is great because even though it's long, the words are not difficult. They keep repeating throughout, so by the time the child is done reading, they really end up remembering those words. The story is cute too."
1,not reccomended,"a book by a worm raiser for his own profit, thou i thought it would be good, he had a lot of references to himself, thou the phone#s have been disconnected because he no longer wants to be bothered by smaller customers unless you basically give your product (worms) away for free while he makes all the profit, not reccomended at all."
1,Terrible Representation of Book,"RIP OFF. DO NOT BUY!I am upset that the picture and description for this book are misleading, and GREATLY OVERPRICED, for a home-made plastic coil binding. The description does not accurately describe this as a 50 pg xerox copy with cheap plastic coil binding for $25 (much more than a real bound book), nor does the title for the false representation in the picture tell that it is ONLY a picture of the COVER (minus the pages and binding), and is not a picture of the ACTUAL BOOK in selling condition, probably for fear that the buyer would have a fair chance to see what they are actually wasting their money on. I am GREATLY dissapointed in this buyers shady selling technique!If this is not the sellers fault and is the fault of the book creator I will gladly take down my poor review but my common sense tells me the seller is responsible for the accuracy of the product they are advertising!"
4,One of the best thrillers ever,"This is up there with Marathon Man and The Day of the Jackal. The only complaint I have about the book is that the movie turned out better. Not because of the plot changes; they weren't significant, but because the the narration in the book is overdone vs dialog and immediate scene. I've never read anything else by Harris, but I would like to see this book written by someone else just to see how much better this excellent plot could be.Sorry if I am stepping on the toes of a thriller classic, but if Robert Ludlum or Elmore Leonard (I acknowledge, two very different writers) had written this, it would have been much more gripping. As it is, you can't go wrong. It's a classic for a reason, but I just think that Harris could have stepped it up more by putting you inside the head of the characters while they were in the action instead of being so analytical from an omniscient veiwpoint."
3,"ok, but not great","The recording seems to be ok, but the orchestra and voices could use a little tuning. Worked well enough to use to practice an upcoming rendering in our church."
2,Grinds paper and leaves metal shavings on the cabinet,"I ordered the Oster 3126 Tall Can Opener, Black to replace my Tall Black & Decker that I had used for many years. I read the reviews and thought that the majority of good reviews outweighed the few that were negative. I was wrong. The Oster can opener is loud, which I can live with since I am not opening up cans all day. The thing that finally turned me against it was the fact that EVERY can I open, it grinds up the paper label clogging the blade and leaving a mess on the counter. It also (on some cans) actually leaves little metal shavings on the blade and on the counter (I know it's the metal of the can because the label isn't shiny like that). If I could return it, I would. But I've had it too long. I wonder if there are ""good"" batches of them and ""bad"" batches of them based on the vastly different reviews. I gave it 2 stars because it does open a can. Otherwise, pass on it."
2,Disappointed in Can Opener,I like the style and color (black) of the can opener. I like that it will open tall cans. It operates quickly once you are able to get it to pick up the can.I did not like how it shreds the paper on the outside of the can. It leaves a mess on the counter and sometimes the shredded paper gets in the can or stuck in the can opener's gear.I would not recommend it.
4,Glad I bought this!,"I'm happy with mine. Works fairly well & quickly. And I love the color, it looks nice in my kitchen. A great deal on this little opener!"
3,Can opener could use an easier method to attach a can.,Can opener could use an easier method to attach a can. My bride and I are way past the 70 year old age. It is very difficult to get a can started because the attachment of the blade will move in and out and will completely come off.
3,Works great for regular size cans.,I would have liked it a bit sturdier and easier to use with larger cans. All in all. it works fine forr the price.Rather noisy.
5,Review of Oster 3126 Tall Can Opener,This was a good Can Opener. The only thing I thought which is probably my fault is that the Knife Sharpener was electric. It is not. It is a manual one and you just pull the blade through it. Other than that it is a great can opener.
5,Great Can opener,"The can opener works well. It took just a few tries to get used to the ""new"" way to use the razor blade vs the rotating wheel that was on my old opener.I find nothing wrong with the design...tall cans fit and the lids are removed easily, no complaints. I recommend it."
3,Hard to get it to attach to the can to get it to start,"It is difficult to get it to grab hold of the can to get it to start opening.This requires a 2 handed process. One to hold the can up to get it to grab and 1 to push down to get it to start - it is when you push down that you find out whether it will accept/hold the can or not.Sometimes it holds the can well after opening, but sometimes it starts to tilt the can, so have to really watch it as it is finishing.This is my first can opener. I don't use this much, it isn't the easiest to use because it usually takes several tries just to get it to grab the can.It is OK. It isn't something that will make me an electric can opener fan."
3,Sloppy startup,"I bought this opener because I love Red and it stated it fit all sizes. On startup it is hard to get started and to allow for large cans it adjusts. The problem is it is so sloppy it falls apart when you try to get it to starts. It works, but not very happy with it."
2,Disappointed,"Way overpriced for the mediocre performance. Loud, poor grip. On the up side, it does open cans! But so did the much cheaper can opener I had before!"
3,Not the color I expected,This can opener was not the color red I thought. I wanted a metallic red can opener to match my oster toaster. The can opener itself was just another can opener.
2,Ok at best.,This can opener works but is difficult to line up cans. It reams the paper along the top of the can so it ends up flaking into contents of can. You can't easily stop it before it goes all of the way around the lid to avoid the lid falling into the can. Overall I'm not really pleased with this opener.
3,Tall and red,It works knife sharpener is manual pull thru. Problem opening cans unless you peel label from top 1 inch it pulls it into gear and binds up. leaves little chewed up chunks of paper all over.
1,Unhappy with performance,Looks really good but is very difficult to use. It does not want to clamp down on the cans easily. You end up spending forever trying to clamp to the can or the opener turning over. My 10 year old opener still worked perfectly but yellowing from age so I ordered this one. Several of family members tried it and we back to the hand operated one we had in the drawer when electricity off during storms.
1,Great...when it worked.,"Used this can opener a few times before Thanksgiving. Used it on Thanksgiving, and the neighbors used it too, then it died. Not worth it."
1,bad experience,Could not get it to work. Would not open any kind of can. Shipped it back for a full refund. Amazon service was good but the can opener was not
1,I wasted my amazon gift card on this item!,"Most disappointing. I put my very attractive looking can opener on the counter and did not use it until a few days later after the box it came in was already picked up to be recycle. OTHERWISE, I WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT! It was difficult to attach the can to the opener to start operation. Then the blade or something snagged the can label and tore it off as the can turned. Not once, but every time. It also turned and cut the can very slowly. I purchased this with an Amazon gift card. So much for that gift."
1,Not a good product,"I would not reccomend this product for purchase. It does not grasp the can good, the mechanism that rotates the can power level is very, very slow. The magnet will not hold heavy or light-weight can goods and the peice that should peforate the can good does not. It is really a nice color and good-looking appliance, but it does not do what it is suppose to do and I would ot buy this product again even to replace the one that I am returning."
1,worst ever purchase,"worst ever, would not open cans had to fight to get it to catch it and when it did it jammedright away, sending back."
3,It works,It works but sometimes have trouble getting the can to start. Also it isn't the exact clor of red I wanted still have not found the right color it will do for now
1,Poor Quality - Returned After First Use,"I really liked the look of this can opener...1st one I received the front was scratched up and smudged, like it had been used.....returned it for a replacememnt....2nd one was also scratched and smudged...but not as bad as the 1st one...I was going to keep until I opened my first can....the paper from the can got shredded and caught in the cutting gear...had to clear the paper out of the gear...wasn't going to deal with this everything time I opened a can....returned and am looking for another can opener."
4,Dark and Brooding,"If you love Mathew MacFayden and you want to see him do something very different, rent this video. It's very dark and rather scary. Not a monsters and ghosts kind of scary, but a human behavior scary. I would give it 5 stars, but I didn't think the characters were given enough time to develop."
2,disappointed,I have almost everything Matthew Macfadyen has done. He is one of my favorite British actors. But this one I did not care for at all. I really enjoyed him I just didn't like the storyline.
2,Okierose,"The purchasing and delivery of this item was excellent; wasn't too crazy about the movie overall. It was dark and somewhat disturbing, featuring religious people as way over zealous and a bit on the crazy side, as though Godly people can't just be normal people."
2,D-U-L-L. Dull.,I hate to have to write this because I am a huge fan of Matthew Macfadyen's work -- but this movie was D-U-L-L. Dull. It was heavy and dragged. And preached. And the colors were dreary. And not a happy ending in sight. The acting was extremely believable but I think this film was just not my cup of tea. Too heavy. Sorry Matthew.
4,Stellar CD but - Buyer Beware!,"No I have not yet seen Jeff Beck perform live, but with this CD at least I feel as if I have heard him play live. His bandmates, all giants in their own pools, are spectacular! I highly recommend this superb recording but caution the buyer as to where you purchase it. I obtained mine through Jeff Beck's website. It took what seemed forever to reach me in the mail, but the price was worth it. Jeff Beck rocks the friggin house down on this disc! Beck is truely one of the last great guitar players living today! Long live Jeff Beck! - Ciao"
1,worked great for a little while.....,When I spend close to $100.00 for a toaster over I expect it to last at least a few years. Not this one. I used it occasionally to reheat chicken or on a rare occasion a piece of toast. I have not used it 25 times in the 10 months I have had it and the top element just stopped working. The bottom still comes on but not hot enough to work properly. I had my old Black & Decker for 10 years and only had to replact it because I broke it accidently. I will never buy another Cuisinart. You are paying for a name but not for a quality product. Buyer Beware.D.C. in Florida
1,This Is Not The One You Want To Buy,"We've owned this toaster oven for about 1-1/2 yrs and have replaced it because of the following.....Flaws include-1. The elements continue to heat when the door if opened during a toasting/oven cycle - VERY DANGEROUS2. Takes FOREVER to toast bread to even a light brown3. The outside dimensions are way TOO BIG for a average sized counter top4. The control knobs are made of a CHEAP PLASTIC and are prone to break over time5. The toasting/baking rack does not extend forward when opening the access door - VERY DANGEROUSTHIS PRODUCT IS, IN ONE WORD, TERRIBLE."
1,Long Term Problem NOT Being Addressed by Cuisinart AKA Conair,"Cuisinart Classic Toaster Oven/Broiler ChromeI purchased this product several years ago. Within the warranty period (3 years) I came home to find an alarm sounding. I traced it to this toaster oven which was plugged in but with the function dial in the off position. The unit was cool to the touch but I requested a replacement unit. Well, 1 year and 4 months later, I found the replacement unit plugged in, in the off position with the buzzer sounding continuously. This time the unit was hot. Since I reported this problem to Cuisinart over a year ago, it appears that nothing has been done about the malfunction. See reports underCuisinart TTOB-30BW Toaster Oven/Broiler."
1,Terrible temperature control,"Extremely disappointed with this product, which I bought to replace a 20 year old Toast R Oven which was still working perfectly (I just needed larger capacity). This oven seems to have only one temperature setting: incinerate! Baking cookies at 350 degrees yielded sizzling black hockey pucks. Tried again at 250 degrees... same problem. I thought maybe my particular unit was defective; I returned it for another one and the same thing happened. This model is just bad. Unfortunate, since I've used many other excellent Cuisinart products."
1,Fire Hazard- Do Not Purchase!,I have owned this toaster oven less than one year. It has always sparked a little every time I turn it on. Today the Bake cycle will not function at all. I should have read the reviews first. Total waste of $100.
1,Don't give me a used oven.,"When I received the oven, I was so angry and disappointed that the toaster oven broiler has been used. It is not brand new at all! There were many heavy scrapes inside and outside this machine. Furthermore, there are even small pieces of food left inside the oven. I spent money to buy a new oven not a second hand oven."
1,Lasted less than a year,"I thought that this one would be reliable because of the Cuisinart brand. It worked great in the beginning, and I like the way the knobs are designed. One day the Broil and Bake functions just stopped working. The Toast setting still worked, but was slow. I was surprised that less expensive toaster ovens that I have purchased have lasted me much longer than this one."
1,"Cheap, and ugly","Bought this oven about 6 months ago and didn't realize just how large and heavy it was but was willing to live with that if it worked well.The first thing I noticed about it was that the 4 elements do not turn on and heat up at the same time.They are very slow to get red, first the bottom two will get red after about 2 minutes and then one of the top two after another 1 minute and then finally the last one after another 30 seconds.The other problem was the timer control knob, right after I bought it I noticed that sometimes it would start timing and sometimes it would just sit there. Tried manually to get the timer working by turning the knob back to beginning and setting it again, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, I figure it will be just a matter of time before it quits working altogether.Makes lots of crackling and clicking noises while it is heating up and cooling down.Feels cheap and tinny, it's going back to the store tomorrow.Just another piece of junk from China."
1,Don't like timer,"I've been very happy with the older model that has the start and stop buttons. I've had that for seven years now, but it doesn't heat that well anymore. Since I liked it so much, I decided to get the newer model. I returned it two days later. I just hated that timer. The ticking is very noisy and there is no way to stop it. I don't know why Cuisinart thought that they should add a timer. They really screwed that up. The old model was perfect."
4,Had this one for six years!!,"This toaster oven was a wedding present in 2006. It has been one of the best gifts we received. We used it all the time to cook just about anything when it was just the two of us. Now we use it a lot for smaller portions for the kids. It only just recently started acting up (i.e., toaster was on the lightest setting and it still toasted really dark). So for the first 5.5-6 years it has worked perfectly. We could not imagine our lives without it. It was a great size for apartment or house counter space. Everything was easy to clean. The only things I thought could make it better were a timer and a preheat function."
4,"Wish it was what I had expected, but it works.","My parents owned one of these from when the series first came out. It was phenomenal. I purchased this hoping to get the same one and then was disappointed to pull out the newer designed, energy efficient version. Now I'm not some gas guzzling hater but I fail to understand why they updated something that didn't need updating. However, it has held up through a lot of stupidity ( someone putting things directly on the burner ) and infrequent cleanings so I give it a 4 because it still does what it's supposed to do and pretty damn well."
1,slow toaster,"Slow toaster. It was so bad I thought it was broken, so I returned it and to my surprise it cost me 28.00 for the return shipping. What a warranty. The new one was no better. Don't buy this product.Cuisinart you would think it was made in USA no, China garbage.1/2 star"
2,Poor construction / poor reliability,"We have had this unit for approximately 4 years. It functioned well for about 1 year. We noticed the toaster setting seemed to progressively toast darker and darker. We consequently have adjusted the desired setting lighter and lighter. Now, we are at the lightest setting and still it is almost too dark. Additionally, I believe the toasting setting relies on reaching a certain internal temperature and then stops the cycle. We have noticed that after one item is toasted, the subsequent item will not toast adequately on one or even 2 cycles. The toaster shuts off too quickly. You must toast it minimum 3 times.Lastly, and most disappointingly, the included pan rusts!!! We had noticed this ~ 9 months into ownership. It started as one small area and was not a big deal. Now however, the rust is most everywhere on the pan itself. Poor alloy, poor us. Our ownership experience has left a lot to be desired. This likely will be our last Cuisinart product."
4,Worked great for six years...,... until yesterday when it would not turn off. Actually I was looking here for a new one to replace it but now I am not sure I will buy that model again reading all the reviews. Looks like we were very lucky that it broke down after 6 years.Up until now the only thing I was unhappy with was the drip pan. It has gotten all rusty and peeling after just a few weeks of use. I would simply line the bottom with foil though and never bothered to seek the warranty.
1,Times up for the toasters timer!,"I mainly used this product for making toast and occasionally broiling. The timer on the toast function does not keep time anymore and basically every time someone tosses in a piece of toast it just burns it to smithereens. It seems not only did the timer time out...but the toast setting is stuck at dark and burns everything that goes into it. We owned it happily for a few years before this happened. (just enough time for the warranty to run out)(story of my life)...So, if you are looking for a short term toaster commitment. This is the one! I myself am moving on to a new toaster that actually turns off! This one is freaking me out and forcing me to leave the fire extinguisher nearby while toasting some bread. NoT cOOL!"
1,This toaster is possessed!,"We had this toaster for less than a year. It worked well at first, we used it mainly for toasting, but then after a while it would only work sporadically. Then every so often it would just start beeping while in the off position and I would have to unplug it to get it to stop. Finally, when I tried to broil some fish in it and realized the broil function no longer worked, I decided to take it back to BB&B. I exchanged it for the same model, thinking I had gotten a lemon, but I am so glad I decided to read some reviews on it. Seeing that most people have had the same problems, I returned it tonight and got a different (and more expensive but way cool) model that received rave reviews without one complaint about sparks. I have three young boys; I'm busy as it is trying to keep my house from burning down. I don't need to add a toaster oven to my list of hazards."
1,dangerous junk,"Had this given to us, no receipt, less than 6 months, won't shut off.Better to put this in the trash than burn down the house."
1,"Unreliable, potentially unsafe.","We've had similar problems with our Cuisinart TOB-30W as the other reviewers. We owned our first unit for two years before it started crackling and sparking when we turned it to Bake. Then it finally stopped working. Cuisinart replaced it with a brand new unit that lasted only one year before it started doing the same. They told us the three year warranty was not renewed when we received the new unit, so now they aren't able to help us. It appears that we're probably safer without the toaster oven based on the other reviews here."
2,worked great for awhile,"I bought this last year for a summer cabin, so it has only been used periodically over a total span of six months. Suddenly the thing refuses to turn off. We noticed this when the smoke alarm went off last night! It only turns off when unplugged. Not only that, the top unit stopped working completely so all we can do is bake. It was great while it lasted, but I read these same complaints in other reviews so this is evidently a glitch in this particular model. I don't recommend."
2,Wish I had read reviews before buying,"It is working after approximately 2 years. Still it is a clunker. The markings wipe off the knobs with a finger's touch, obscuring the temperature or function. Cuisinart is willing to send new knobs, but the old ones do not appear to be removable without removing the entire panel, which does not appear to be easy.Somehow I was expecting more from the brand name ""Cuisinart"". It sounds French but is made in China.The oven door is in jeopardy, and feels like it may come off. It is not flush. A strange buzzing sound sometimes emits when the item remains plugged into the wall and not being used.I guess I was expecting it to be a higher quality than it actually is. It looks the part, but does not function like an ""industrial kitchen item"".I will be reading reviews from now on before buying household items."
1,"Malfuncting dial switch, hazard - needs to be recalled by Cuisinart.","My toaster oven (Cuisinart TOB-30W Toaster Oven/Broiler) is also malfunctioning as described above. The oven stays ON all the time, no matter if the dial switch is turned to OFF. The ON light is on and the upper heating element stays ON. The bottom heating element does not work now. It is mandatory to keep the appliance unplugged. I bought mine exactly one year ago at Christmas, and this malfunctioning switch problem just started this Christmas 2005. I hope I can find my receipt, however, I think the manufacturer should be notified and they should issue a credit for a purchase of a new revised model, and recall this particular model"
2,Very Dangerous,"I bought my Cuisinart 30W Toaster Oven/Broiler on 12/11/2005. For Two months it worked Great, then I woke up at 8:30 a.m. Supperbowl morning to the smell of an electrical fire. Ran out to the Kitchen to discover that it was the Cuisinart 30W Toaster Oven/Broiler it had come on even though the switch was off. My Cuisinart Burnt up, I still had the reciept and returned it for a Kitchen Aid. Hopefully, the KitchenAid works without the defects of the Cuisinart.Suggestion: Unplug the Unit after every use, even if it has an on/off switch."
1,Unsafe for use,"My Cuisinart TOB-30BCC Toaster/Broiler oven started to short out and burn when I used the bake option. I took it apart to see why it was shorting out. I found that the knob that connects the circuit was made out of plastic and had melted. Thus, in a state of deformity no longer able to connect the circuit. This is what is happening with all of these reviews. Question: Why would a designer of a toaster oven that has a 500 degree setting make such an integral part out of plastic. Answer: to shave a few dollars off of production costs to squeeze out a little more for the bottom line. And on top of that, have it manufactured in a sweat shop in China. My grandpa has a toaster oven that over 30 years old that was made in America and it still works great. What sad greedy times we live in."
1,Fire hazard,"This is possibly the worst and most dangerous kitchen appliance ever created by man.The dial will break, locking it to 'broil' or some inconvenient setting, it turns on and off unpredictably, and even when it was working it didn't toast anything evenly or heat to the correct temperature. They need to recall these, they are dangerous.The only Cuisinart product out of five that I own that works well is the food processor. I will never buy a Cuisinart product again. (I have 5 because they were house warming gifts, I would have learned my lesson after the first otherwise)"
5,Probably destined to be a Classic,"This is a down to earth , excellently illustrated , well written and innovative book. Bob quickly becomes your friend and mentor , guiding the reader through each tying stage without prior assumption .Personally , and I,m sure for most readers , this book sets trains of thought in motion . What more could a fly tier want ?"
3,Good choice of tunes and songs by U.S. Coast Guard in the 40s,"This CD represent a good choice of tunes and songs of the 40s played and sung by the Rudy Vallee & His Famous World War II U.S. Coast Guard Band. When you listen it, you hear some noise and scratches but it is a recordings of the 40s. However, if you do not care about these ""details"", you will know more about the music of the 40s. Obviously, there is a military touch because it is done by the U.S. Coast Guard Band. Some tunes have always a New Orleans or Jazz touch. 3 stars is an ""adequate"" ranking."
3,too wide,"good quality and adhesivness, but the letters are as wide are they are tall. it makes the 2 inch letters look alot bigger than they should."
4,A variation of rhythmes......,"To make this short....I purchased 'BOA' due to the 'opening song' in 'LAIN' animated 'psychological' movie. Since i thought that most of 'jasmine rogers' music was as emotional and equivalent, it was not. Though there were different styles of music on the CD, most of the songs were great!However, for those of you who 'think' that it will be as emotional as the 'opening song' in 'LAIN', i am telling you now. These types of music are included; ROCK 50%, JAZZ/BLUES 20%, EMOTION 30%!!HAPPY LISTENING FOLKS!!"
4,"beautiful, and different","BOA definitely has a different style. To be perfectly honest, the only two songs I listen to with any regularity are the first, ""Duvet,"" and the fifth ""Elephant"". However, these two songs are well worth the money for the cd, particularly ""Duvet"", which, if you are an anime fan, I'm sure you'll have heard as the opening theme song from ""Serial Experiments: Lain"".The other music is good as well, although, I feel, not quite up to the caliber of ""Duvet"".This is a very good cd overall, reminiscent of Dido (although chronologically it should be the other way around, I think). If you are an anime fan looking for that opening theme song, then here it is, and it sounds even better in the cd player than on tv. For anyone else eager to try something new, this is it, and I doubt you'll regret the money spent."
1,"Spinner talking about ""No Spin""","I closely followed her news conferences during early Iraq Invasion. It's so sad that ""integrity"" has no place now a days. She is no where on the substance starting from the title."
1,Doesn't make logical sense,"As Torie's interview on the Daily Show highlighted, Torie has a logical dilemma. On one hand she claims that Spin is everywhere, yet she titles her book Spin is over. Which is it? The book never settles this basic point."
1,cliche-ridden,No spin era? Please. I supposed it's possible that this book concerns politics and media relations on a different planet. Maybe I should give Ms. Clarke the beneift of the doubt on that.
2,"Good movie, but why pay for it?","This is a great film, but it's only 6 mins long. Why spend the price of a feature film when you can easily download this short from the net (like iFilm)? I can't believe the creators are selling out like that."
5,effective,Who doesn't need a concentrated effort for their buns.I sit all day at my desk and need extra effort.I work out with a personal trainer twice a week and do this video every day.
3,Nothing to do with the book,"I highly recommend the book with the uplifting story. Except for the title and the names of the characters this movie has little to do with the book. An ordinary ""John Wayne"" movie."
1,Familiar Title as a Marketing Device,"Perhaps Shepherd of the Hills- The Movie could have stood on its own legs using a different title or maybe not. One thing is certain: this John Wayne vehicle bears absolutely no resemblence to a piece of classic American literature under the same name. As it stands, the movie uses only the book's title and character's names and nothing else.I would love to see a ""re-make"" of Shepherd of the Hills which follows the beloved storyline."
2,The Shepherd of the Hills,"I watched this movie after having read the book. Unfortunately, the movie twisted the whole story around and was not true to the book at all. I felt that the book was an uplifting story and the movie was much darker. I guess the movie is okay, if you haven't read the book, but I would have loved to see the story told as it was in the book. I would highly recommend the book ""The Shepherd of the Hills"" over the movie."
5,EXCELLENT!,Giustozzi knows more than any one about what was going on inside pro-soviet Afghanistan. I think he is also a good pupil of Prof. Halliday. Perhaps no other scholar knows more about the Afghan government and society in 1978-92.
3,Cute but annoying,"Dancing Mumble is cute, and my children love to play with him, BUT he really gets on your nerves after a while. He dances to a reggae song that repeats over and over again. I wish he had a few more selections in him! Plus, he falls over easily."
1,how to put your kid asleep,"My daughter received this game for her 9 year old birthday. It is probably the most confusing and boring game a kid could get. A zillion pieces and the most confusing rules imaginable. We are both familiar with the Harry Potter books and movies so I was expecting something playable and fun. I guarantee she will never play this game again after setting up for a 1/2 hour and playing for a tedious 20 minutes. Boring, boring , boring. A total waste.This game is a good example of someone just trying to make money off a popular franchise name."
2,STINKY,"I thought this toy would be better but it turned out that all it is, is A BIG WASTE OF TIME! This game takes a very long time to set up (maybe 25 minutes). I playd this game 2 times and i never played it again! I didn't like this game and don't recomend this to other people."
1,Don't buy this game!,The directions on this game is are terrible!! I gave it to a friend b/c I tried to figure it out with my 8 year old and she was as confused as I was. We ended up returning this game. Don't bother buying it!! :(
1,I love Harry Potter but....,"Don't get me wrong! I love Harry Potter, but this game is too confusing. I read all 4 of the books 2 times and I read the directions a million times through, but they are so wacko and confusing. I don't think it is just me. I recommend buying the card game (awesome!!) if you want to experience Quidditch and don't bother with this game!! Its better anyways..."
3,it stunk,it is really hard to set up but i do like harry potter but i am very sad at the game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Quiddich in the Muggle (human)World,"I think it's a fun game, but a little confusing to figure out. I had read the book so I knew what it was supposed to look like. If playing this game, it would be hard to figure out the directions if you, or another player, haven't read the book(s)."
3,Puzzle,"This puzzle seems like a great idea, but the audio is triggered by light sensor. This make the puzzle say the number when you put the piece in the slot, but it also causes the puzzle to call out any number your hand shadows. It can easily confuse a child trying to learn his/her numbers."
2,Narnia all over again...........,"This is a really boring game. There was never a time where this game really put me into the game. The graphics are pretty good, but the system requirements are outragis. so unless you have a pretty good machine don't buy this game. If you do have a pretty good machine and you liked Narina (the game) than you will probley like this game, if you didn't like narnia than don't get this game. Most pepole will not like this game. Nobody will like this game unless you have a gamepad. i would not recommend buying this game. it stinks."
1,DO NOT buy Eragon on the PC!!!,"Eragon on the pc is a direct console port! The mouse is NOT used in any way in this game. You cannot remap ANY of the controls. You are forced to use the WSAD commands and you cannot change these at all. You cannot even use the left mouse click to attack with a weapon! There is also no free look with the mouse, everything is 100% keyboard controlled. Even the menu is keyboard driven. This makes for a completely ruined pc gaming experience."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!,"Downright terrible. Lousy camera angles, no in depth story and if you don't have a gamepad for your PC for this, you are really screwed! Plus, you will be done in 4 to 5 hours maximum!!!Go online and GOOGLE reviews for this game and read them. Basically, here is all you need to know. A movie studio got the rights to this fabulous book, pressured a game developer to bang it out fast. Hence, you have a crappy game released well ahead of the movie just for the greed of making a buck and riding off the hype of the movie. Even on XBOX this thing plays terrible!Skip this and get Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion or Dark Messiah if you want in depth, heavy adventure that will keep you going for months....at a lower price!!!"
4,They Forgot 3 Buckets!!!!,"Of course, who's not happy to see a respected group with the essential of his musicology in a CD? I'm one of them, to listen again to some anthological tracks like ""I like"", ""Do Me Right"" or ""Dancin"" is very nice but unfortunately, how they forget ""Goodbye love"", ""My Business"" and ""Spend Time""?Indeed these mistakes, if you got some money to spend, it's better for you to buy this CD after all because we know how good the Hall'S and Riley are!Enjoy it!"
3,FORGOT A BIG ONE!,"Let me say that this is a great cd...by a great group whose music got me through some tough times many years ago. That being said this comp gets 3 stars simply because who ever put it together didn't include ""Goodbye Love"". This song to me was a cut above all of the rest, and is one of the true great R & B ballads. You get a chance to hear the real haunting quality of Halls voice. And, you begin to sadden at the fact that he never got to sing more songs like that!"
4,Tight Set,Guy was a Slammin Group back in the Day.Aaron Hall was a Soulful Cat&Teddy Riley was Bringing the Strong New Jack Swing Cuts.they had alot of Catchy Jams but somehow after a while it felt more like Business as to Making it work as a Group.but then again Teddy was rolling as a Producer.Aaron Hall never got that Solo Career he deserved.but this Set still is a Really Good Set&Captures alot of what they were doing back in the day.
4,trampoline records,This is a really really good cd. Trampoline Records Greatest Hits Vol. 1 is full of talent and that shows easily through the music. All the songs go together nicely yet they are all unique and different from eachother. This is the perfect album to relax to and I highly reccomend it.
1,Placebo,The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ruled that it is illegal to sell red yeast rice that contains more than trace amounts of the cholesterol-lowering substances and to promote red yeast rice for lowering cholesterol levels.
3,No reason to buy this edition for most listeners,"This is 1-CD edition of the ""The Very Best Of: Only The Beginnings""(2002). All tracks in this CD are from ""Very Best"" and the liner notes of it is completely same to VB's.In my opinion, this edition is released for several foreign countries. Therefor, this is a complete collector's item for US,Japan,... You should buy ""The Very Best"", if you can.But the song sellection of this edition (Most of them are works after ""If You Leave Me Now"") is interesting for me."
2,"No way a 2-disc set can be a ""complete"" greatest hits for this band",This import compilation only scratched the surface of this band that is some 40 years old. A better compliation would be Group Portrait or The Box. Those compilations are more of a cross section and chronology of the band's history. Don't waste your money on this one. The band Chicago does not even consider this part of their official discography.
3,HELP ME!,"CAN U TAKE GAME SAVES OFF THE PSP AND PUT THEM ON YOUR COMPUTER WITH THIS THING, IF U CAN PLEASE TELL ME HOW!THANKS GOOD PEOPLE"
1,Broke First Time I Used It,"The job I was doing wasn't even that hard, just making a picture frame. One problem, was not enough support to keep the pieces in place, so I added a little more pressure, and the screws that hold the the moving head broke through and it was ruined. I would not recommend this product for anything that requires any strong holds, perhaps I just wouldn't recommend period. I do however, have a pair of Irwin's quick adjustable grips that are wonderful and have lasted for years.Sam"
3,"Clamp is fast and easy to use, but limits flexibility","This is a great design, but you are unable to adjust the two sides independently. This isn't great for corners, it's much better for Ts."
1,Junk,"Just like another poster, mine broke the first time I used it. I was a little surprised since there is some heft to these clamps. Mine failed at the part of the clamp that is movable and rides on the worm screw that adjusts to the thickness of the boards. There are 4 screws that are recessed and holds the two halves of this part of the assembly together. It doesn't appear there is enough material on the casting for the screw heads to hold the two halves together. Aside from welding the two halves together, they will get thrown in the trash."
3,"Good design, poorly constructed","The design of the Irwin Quick-Grip clamp from Amazon is a good concept -- a perfect idea for construction of anything needing you to hold pieces in place for glue-ups and screwing pieces together. Unfortunately the Irwin clamp is ""loosely"" constructed with too much slop in the movement of the clamp, making it problamatic when trying to fit loose pieces together - you shouldn't have to fight a sloppy clamp as well as the parts of your project. The clamp should be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. I see this same clamp advertized under a number of manufacturers' brand names, e.g., the Jet 52841 and the Bessey Angle/Corner Clamp WS3 appear to be pretty much identical - I don't know whether they are all made in the same factory or not so this review may not apply to the other brands."
5,great clamp,I am using a set of four clamps to glue and nail bee boxes together. Easy to use.Strong Quick attachment I would repurchase
1,Price gouging,"If you've never seen the show, it's one of the best comedy shows in a long time. If you are unsure, it's worth purchasing a couple of individual shows.*** Buyer Beware ***This seller who is charging twice what it's worth. You can buy individual seasons for $17 - $22 a season."
3,Kim's Review,I think that the 'Harry Potter Hagrid's New Arrival' statue is a beautiful piece that every Harry Potter fan should own. The amount of detail on it is extraordanarie. I think Harry Potter books are the best in the world so I think I will ask for one for my birthday
2,slappy from goosebumps,It is all right and evrything but it dose not look like slappy watch the movie(The Night Of The Living Lummy)and please try to do better with its looks.
2,Slappy isn't so happy,Slappy is not well put together. His shoes won't stay on (lost already). It's not easy to make his mouth move...my son hasn't played with him since the 2nd day he had him. I am disappointed ...but glad I didn't spend any more than we did.
5,Cant wait for my daughter to open this present!!!!!,"I cannot wait to see my daughters face when she opens this present! She is gonna flip a wig! The product is durable but not heavy and the mouth works with a simple pull of the string. Included is a ""how to"" book."
2,Fagile Slappy,Dolls shoes come off all the time. The mechanism to open and close the dolls mouth is not what is usually done for a ventriloquist doll. One of the hands of the doll has come off and cannot be re-attached. Doll is very fragile and quality is not what I expected at all. I would not buy this doll again for my son.
2,Not at all what we expected! Just a stuffed doll with a string....,I purchased this for my son for his 11th birthday. I was less than impressed when it arrived. I guess you don't get much for 30 bucks......All this toy is....is a stuffed doll with a string attached the the back of it's head. His clothes don't stay on (I finally pinned the pants to the shirt). His eyes are supposed to glow in the dark....but they don't. My son complained that he couldn't pull the string (to move the mouth) and hold the doll without having to put it in a head lock. I tried it and I couldn't pull the string without having to grab the doll by the head. This makes it pretty hard to play with it the way you would think you would with a Ventriloquist doll.
2,Poor Dummy,"This dummy is in extremely poor quality. I purchased Slappy for my six-year-old son, and sure, he loves the thing, but it won't last him very long. It's not that he man-handles the dummy, either. To put things into perspective, this doll came with shoes--shoes that never stay on. The shoes need to be held up by rubber bands, otherwise they slide off very easily. In addition, the body can't hold the weight of the doll's gargantuan head, so it's always slouched over. Also, don't accidentally drop this thing on the floor--the paint is poor quality and it gets scuffed like you wouldn't believe."
2,pants a saggin',"...maybe pants that sag are fashonable with the hip hop generation, but slappy is not a hip hopper.as well, the pull string at the back of slappy's head is a poor design. i would think a better method for making slappy's mouth move could be achieved for a similar cost."
4,My son loves it!,"My son really wanted this for his Birthday. Since he received it, he hasn't put it down. My son is 8 yrs. old and not very gentle on his toys. This dummy has so far been able to take the punishment! It only took 3 days for me to get it. I will definitely buy again from this company."
5,sink suction cup,Love this item. It lets me keep my scrubber-brush upright to drain in the sink. Works best when put out of the way from the soap & water.
3,The other reviewers have summed it up...,"OK book, good concept, but somewhat lacking. Lots of short stories and retelling of events, but no research, or concrete conclusions. It reminded me of books Brad Steiger wrote several years ago. Same old material, different spin.If you are into UFO books, you will likely enjoy this read. I think that I was expecting something a little more akin to synchronicity or reality-changers."
2,Not a very good book,"This is a compilation of different stories that can be linked to time travel. The stories them selves are interesting but in between there is a lot of comments by the author that is frankly very boring to read. Mostly just her opinion about stuff, no real research was done. The author seems to hate UFO believers and ridicules them every chance she gets. This was an interesting book but because of the author inappropriate comments on ufoligists and the ufo field in general I will not buy another of her books. This book was called ""Time Storms"", not ""I Don't Believe in UFO so nobody else should either"""
2,disappointing dichotomy,"Well, what a change from Jenny. The arguments and proposals for Time travel are understandable, but the dichotomy of views in the UFO area is frankly disappointing. Jenny, once a champion UFOlogist has either been `got at' or has had a change of direction after more than 25 years preaching her beliefs. The impact of her new book has been diluted by her change of belief. This is still an interesting book, but all credibility has now been lost"
1,So when is the Rapture?,"Read Gentry, or Demar instead. Unfortunately nonsense like Lindsey style fiction sells."
4,Hot Sparks - Save Gas,"I had heard that CD ignition units would improve gas mileage and this unit sounded like the best value for the money. I installed it on my '96 Ford F250, with a 460 big block, daily driver and I calculate about 5% - 7% increase in mileage. At today's gas prices it will pay for itself within a year! The installation manual has example pictures for many different applications so that anyone with good automotive skills should have no problems.On the down side (the reason I don't rate it a 5), the wiring harness isn't that long (~2 feet) so you may have to splice in extensions, the colors red and black are used twice (be careful) and the main power wire does not include a fuse. The unit main power connects directly to the battery so make sure you add a fuse near the battery end of the wire!"
2,Amped is way better than SSX Tricky,"If you're thinking about buying this game, I would recommend against it. I rented it at Blockbuster, and grew tired of it within a few hours - it's very arcade like. I also rented Amped, and it is much more challenging and has tons more replay value. The other great thing about Amped is the ability to rip your own tunes to the hard drive of the Xbox and listen to them while you're playing the game. You can't do this with SSX Tricky. I'll be purchasing Amped for sure."
3,So-So...,"I had the original SSX on PS2 and although Ive only just played it for a few hours I am noticing that there is not much difference between the two versions. The special moves or uber-tricks are definately cool. If you have the original ssx id advise you to rent tricky before you buy, otherwise go for it, its an awesome game with stunning visuals. Havent gotten around to checking out amped but i will soon....."
4,Canadian and spanish chick are JOKERS!,This game is purley and simply fun!Graphics-9/10-it looks real good!Control-7.5/10-minore grinding problemsPresentation-10/10-PERFECT i mean no game is presented better!Gameplay-8/10-some courses are a pain in the ass!Fun Factor-9/10-u'll be playin 4 days!!!!!!!!!!
2,Don't be tricked get amped,"I've found that Amped is a better game than SSXtricky. SSXtricky is hard to learn the controlls for. It seems very unrealistic. You can do four of five rodeos, where in amped you might be able to do two front flips. Also, you can hit a rail at 70mph which can't be done. I beleive that Amped has beter contolls, it's easy to learn but hard to master, while SSXtricky is hard to learn and play. Picked Amped it much more fun to play and with may levels to challange you. If you don't know how to snowboard pick SSXtricky. If you know to snowboard or are a wanna be pick Amped."
1,"Compatibility issues, BE CAREFUL!","This is a great game, no doubt, but IT IS NOT CURRENTLY PLAYABLE ON XBOX 360 and I wish I had known that before I paid money for it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU INTEND TO PLAY IT ON AN ORIGINAL XBOX because it will not work on your modern Xbox 360."
2,BOO,It stinks nice tracks but the tricks you want to do are super hard you have to hit 10 buttons while your in the air.
2,A So-SO game,"I must admit this is a pretty cool game when you first play it. It has good graphics and it is kinda cool to play your friends in it. But after awhile it is really boring. It doesn't really have a story mode so you can't""beat the game"". Once you get all the characters(EASY) and all the courses(easy) this game is no fun. This game is a good game to rent but not to buy. Adios!"
5,Best Snowboarding Game For XBOX,"This game is awesome. I've played Amped and everything and I think Amped is allright but I guess I'm not going for a realistic game. It is great though. The people that say controls are bad shouldnt even own an XBOX. I have small hands and I use the big controller and pull off every trick in the game. I've even pulled off tricks so big it came up as ???. So if you don't like the controlls you don't know how to play the game. The characters are awesome because of all of there different personalities. The graphics are great, the courses are awesome, the characters are sweet. This game is just great. I recomend this game to anyone out there."
4,A Game That Defines Our Generation,"SSX is a fantastic game that clearly shows how far games have progressed throughout the years. SSX is an example of why we should be playing games in the first place - FUN. The world you are set in is colorful and vivid, strewn with fireworks displays and sharp turns. The real beauty of the game lies in the animation and smooth transitions that the characters make while performing their over-the-top tricks and spins. If people could perform these ""UBER"" tricks, SSX gives a good representation of what they would look like. The audio also plays a big part in the game's overall feel and flavor. Each boarder has an individual persona that is voiced by a celebrity, lending much more, well, character to each character. The music is mostly comprised of techno beats that change their tempo and volume, depending on your character's actions. SSX is a great game for pure entertainment and is a fantastic game for your X-Box."
5,Great DVD,"This is a great DVD! It was produced in the '60's, but this doesn't take away from the DVD. Great classic longboard surfing through hawaii and california. Narrated by Bruce Brown, who gives a short history of each surfing spot shown and footage of big name surfers in the 1960's. A great movie for anyone, big surf and small surf as well as humerous pass time activities. I suggest you buy a copy!"
4,If you like surfing,"If you like surfing or the Endless Summer, this is right up your alley. Bruce Brown did this before Endless Summer but this is done in a very similar fashion, narration by Bruce viewing great surfing. He has great shots of the surfing in various places. Not as good as Endless Summer, but right up there close to it. LorRae"
2,Not the right size.,"My pattern that I have that I was going to use these safety pins on said a size 2 was 1-1/2 inches long, These are 1-1/16 inches long. I suppose I will still try to use them but will probably have to order the right sized ones at some point."
2,CQ Patch,"The package arrived in pretty rough shape. But the patches are individually wrapped, so no problem. But its only four months from being out of date. So only order it if you are going to use them right away."
5,You have to Want to Quit!!!,"I'm willing to give this a try after smoking 40 yrs & a quad bypass 3 yrs ago. I'd rather spend the $3500 I've been spending yearly on something I enjoy much more, my music & other home improvements. This addiction is such a terrible waste & I've finally had enough! The truth is, you have to want to put down the cigs & never light up again. This is just a tool to wean yourself off the nicotine, but it's your mind & daily habits you really have to work on!!! Wish me luck!!! Seller was fast shipping."
4,A Very Good Introduction,This book is one of the most valuable I have come across in all the academic studies of Buddhism. I highly recommend it to all.
5,An interesting history of Contract Bridge,"This book is a fascinating history of Contract bridge. It talksa lot about all the big names from early in the game and how bridgecame to be such a passion in the United States. Definitely wortha read for the avid bridge player, particularly Duplicate. If you'reinto bridge history, I'd also recommend ""The Walk of the Oysters""."
5,Wildflowers of the Southern Mountains,This book is my favorite go-to book for help in identifying wildflowers in this region. The pictures are extraordinarily well done and the written descriptions are very helpful.
2,"Title should be ""prayer for Vision""","After reading 5 reviews with 5-stars I had high hopes from this book but unfortunately it came out very poor as per my perception. The author of this book has written ""power of prayer"" and he didn't come out of that mind-set. He wrote down this book totally from spiritual angel. I am not against having spirituality up to some decent proportion but comm'on you don't mention 'GOD"" 8-10 times in each page. I am not exaggerating but suggest you to visit local bookstore to confirm that before buying this book.Keeping that complain aside he has conveyed good msg in this book, at least topics were quite relevant. But it deserves only two starts for ruining good subject of this book."
3,"Nice, but not fantastic","My 6-year-old thought this a neat item when she opened it. The four activity books have your standard activities--mazes, puzzles, dot-to-dot, etc. The pencil and topper are cute, looking like a straw in the cup. The cup leaves a bit to be desired. It's not sturdy and the cap that comes with it does not fit back on it, making it difficult to keep it all together. Overall, an original concept with not enough thought put into the finished product."
1,Damaged product,"We were very pleased with the price and fast shipping on this product. Unfortunately, the bag was damaged. When we got it out to use it for the first time, the logo was worn and the bag had large holes in it. The bag definitely looked used. When we contacted the seller about the product, he insisted that the product was new and must have been damaged during shipping. The box it shipped in did not look damaged so the shipping insurance didn't cover anything. When we again tried to contact the seller about the product warranty to try to get it replaced by Thule, we heard nothing back. SO, we bought a new bag from a different company and are basically out $200+ for the damaged bag that is sitting in our garage. We usually have great luck on Amazon so this is very unfortunate."
4,Worth the investment,"The Ranger 90 did great on our 6.5 hr drives to/from the Outer Banks. We drove home during a tropical Storm, and the bag remained water-tight. The bag installs/uninstalls easily (even in the rain.) Easily stores in included bag.One pice of advice: to minimize wasted space within the bag, soft sided luggage works best."
3,Functional,This item works but they seem to have made it too adjustable. I'm not sure the little stickers you have to put over holes on the bottom will keep water out for long. Additionally the plastic latches seem like they will break shortly. I would much prefer some sort of metal lock down device. I've only used it once and it functioned very well.Plus as far as amazon goes this item was clearly a return and the box arrived unsealed and was missing one of the tie down straps. I didn't notice the missing strap until a couple weeks after I received the item. I'm rather annoyed that Amazon would not take the time to at least tape the box shut... And I have no idea where to complain that the item was not complete...
4,good start,Bought this item because i thought i might be more versital... it is easy to install (put it on the car in about 10 min the first time) and very well made... i would say it doubled the cargo capacity of our vw jetta. good buy for the money. this will be used often since we just had our first child
2,"""krappy operator""","I bought this fan for my small apartment.It does cool off your place, but with much noise.I have three real issues with this fan.1) the cord itself plugs into the fan. It's not part of the fan, not attached. So you have to be carfeul not to stretch the cord out too much or it will come off and your fan will not run until you plug it back in2) The switch for the power levels goes from highest to lowest, not the other way around AND the knob keeps falling off. I have to keep putting it back on for it to even work.3) When you try to move the fan up or down it cracks a lot and sounds as if it will break. And it will not rotate as much as you would thin. And you have to point it to the exact spot you want to be coo0led off or you won't even feel it working.One good thing about it is I sure can count on blocking noise from the neighbors with this loud fan!"
5,Peeler Dealer,"This orange (or grapefruit) peeler is a GREAT deal! Easy to handle, works great... and a good price! I use it all the time."
4,It's A LOT better then the first one.,"Hi well to start this book is awesome!! I really loved this book and I didn't expect much of it because I really didn't like Funny stories. But this book is 10 times better then Funny stories but like the first one it had laugh out loud ones, giggle ones, not funny but entertaining ones, and ones that flat out stunk. My favorite one is wunderpants and my least favorite is the ship of fools. I would give it 5 stars but like I said some of them stunk. But anyway it's a funny book I love it and I'll bet if you read it you will too. Well gotta go hope this was helpful Brooke."
5,Oklahoma women,"This book is the life story, from 18 to her 90's, of Kate Dexter, a feisty, stubborn and determined woman from Oklahoma who survives personal tragedy, povery and marital infidelity, to live to old age. Kate's mother, Cora, ran a successful boarding house, despite the handicap of a totally impractical dreamer of a husband who always had grandiose, get-rich-quick schemes for making money which inevitably failed. Kate married a small town lawyer and was happy enough until their second child was born mentally retarded. The marriage rapidly deteriorated as Kate devoted herself to caring for the child at home, neglecting her husband and other child. It's a story of just how tough a woman can be when needed, just to survive life with all of its tragedies and heartbreak. The indomitable spirit of this woman made me feel rather guilty as I'm sure that I'd never have the strength to forge ahead as she did without breaking."
4,Good,"The original OST, not bad, with all the music of the original motion picture. Good conditions and a nice box."
4,The Who - 'The BBC Sessions' (MCA),"A great compilation CD of the Who's repertoire,that's been culled from the BBC performance archives dating from 1965-73.Total of twenty-five songs with a running time of 71 minutes.One thing I really like about 'BBC Sessions' is that many of these tunes tend to sound a bit different from the original lp versions.With cuts like ""My Generation"",""Anyway,Anyhow,Anywhere"",the James Brown rarity ""Just You And Me,Darling"",""Pictures Of Lilly"",the Motown hit remake ""Dancing In The Streets""(better than Van Halen's version)and a couple of my two all-time Who favorites ""The Seeker"" and ""I'm Free"".Another thing that I fully appreciate about this CD is that the announcer's chatter between songs,introducing the band is a bit less than OTHER 'BBC Sessions' releases I've heard.Recommended."
3,A fair selection of live Who,"The live sound of the early (1965-8) Who often disappoints those who only know the studio albums and Live At Leeds. The band often lacked subtlety and dynamics, was frequently sloppy and occasionally tedious (they didn't jam very well back then). At its best, though, the young Who was a brutal force sweeping all before it in its path, taking poor little blues and soul numbers and beating them to pieces. Listen to the version of Good Lovin'included here for proof. The band's at its best, of course, on their own singles such as 'My Generation' and 'Substitute'. There's a few later oddities thrown in. All in all, not a revelation and hardly a collection of the Who at their live best; it's more of a gap-filler than anything else, but confirmed Who addicts will be pleased with it. Just don't buy it instead of Live At Leeds or Isle Of Wight."
2,Me Too Cash Grab,"Following the habit of many producers to put out anything with a name on it, the cd is an interesting collection of odd Who tunes. While most vary away from the standard studio format none of the versions are particularly inspired. So what do you have? Some really good Who tunes that are enjoyable to listen to. This really is just for the collector who must have different versions of similar songs, it is good but not good enough for the hype or the dollar. I am a big Who fan but would much sooner recommend someone to LaL or TKAA, Quadraphenia and Who's Next (at least) before mentioning this one. Even the liner notes state this follows the Me Toos of Hendrix and Zep BBC tapes that came out after the excellent Beatles collection. Get this after you have purchased many others."
2,Who's Got Your Goat,"Well after hearing on the radio about the new Who BBC Sessions coming out I had to run out and buy it. Especially after I saw Relay, The Seeker, and Long Live Rock on it. Boy was I disappointed. The announcers are so annoying and the sound quality is quite bad in parts. Why can't MCA give us something worthwhile from this great band. I would love to see a special two cd set entitled ""Lifehouse"". Which has all the songs that were from that ill fated project which was trimmed down to become ""Who's Next"" and quite a few singles including ""Relay"" which now can only be gotten in a edited format on the Who's box set. Which by the way is a great waste also."
2,Adequate performances...horrible sound,"Compared to the Jimi Hendrix BBC sessions, the sound quality of this disc is awful. It would have been nice if someone tried to engineer the existing tapes with some extra low-end and bass (like the Beatles BBC album), but for some reason, the engineers didn't. Perhaps the source tapes were a problem, but what were treated to is sharp and shrill early Who, with hardly evidence of John Entwistle at all. This is especially too bad since Pete Townshend hadn't yet developed his ""over drive"" guitar sound and it's a pretty big load for one guitar to handle. Roger Daltrey's vocals are only in the ""so-so"" category. The American bonus disc (from the Target store chain) is definitely not worth tracking down. Overall, the sound of The Who's BBC sessions is worse than the original US compact disc of the MY GENERATION album."
3,Worth a listen or two,"Granted, I've only listened to this all the way through one time, but I was less than enthralled with this album. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I don't think it holds a candle to the Beatles at the BBC discs, for instance. First, the latter tracks are all inferior sounding studio tracks that were ""changed"" by adding a live vocal track.There are some pleasant surprises in the earlier tracks. I like the ""effectless"" version of Disguises, and Run, Run, Run is great. Also nice to get another version of Shakin' All Over, though it seems suspiciously similar to the one issued on the expanded Odds & Sods. Add a couple of sub-par ""covers"" and many previously released tracks (mostly singles) that do not better their studio versions, and that pretty much does it. Nice to have for the Who fanatic, but not one that will get a lot of laser time in my CD player."
2,sound quality is bootleg at best,I abosolutly love The Who.The BBC sessions are a very poor representation of this great band.The comentary between the songs further ruins the album.This one should have stayed in vaults.Get The Kids are alright sound track instead.
2,doesn't last long enough to use professionally,I got this for one of our field techs who needed a new battery but he told me that it runs down much sooner than Makita batteries. That might be ok for hobby users but not those who use the battery throughout the day.
3,Freaky,"The cat's movements aren't lifelike, though they are novel. My daughter prefers ""regular"" stuffed animals; this is hard due to the mechanics and battery box."
5,My Opinion,"An excellent release by a very talented country music recording artist and song writer. This disc is a ""must-have"" for any country music fan."
4,This book stands out among the thousands I read in the 70's,"I loved this book. I was on the verge of joining the Navy, and Mr. Tauber's ireverent look at Basic training was an eye-opening experience. It is a very funny book, filled with loony real-life characters and examples of crazed military thinking. Anyone who has gone through military basic training will get a kick out of this book. I wish I still had my copy!"
5,Nam era Basic in the nut-shell,"I recall buying this book at the Chicago train station as I waited to head for O'Hare Arport with my group from the AFES. That was the first week of June in 1972. This must have just recntly come out in PB format at the time. It was kind of scary to read this thing as I traveled to Ft. Polk La. for Basic and AIT. I thought ""What the hell did I do to myself."" The book rings true for that eras Basic Combat Training and I would recommend it to anyone. After loaning it out to several barracks buddies the Drill Sgt. at last got a hold of it. Never saw it again. But I did replace it now with a new edition from AMAZON after all these years. FTA!"
4,"the army's ""got some 'splainin' to do""","I thought this was an entertaining book, but I think I'd have enjoyed it more if I could have better placed it in context. By this, I mean that I didn't understand whether the type of Keystone Cops training that this group of reservists and what not received was the same as that given to more ""regular"" soldiers. If so, as Ricky might say to Lucy, the army's ""got some 'splainin' to do."" Troop levels in Vietnam were still high when this took place and it's hard to imagine putting people at risk with this kind of incompetent training.Having said that, the book is pretty funny if you overlook the pathetic training regimen. The author and several of his cohorts seemed to have a great time thumbing their noses at the discipline. I find it hard to imagine the army letting them get away with what the author says they did. But, if they did as he wrote they did, the army needs to answer Ricky's question. The rest of us are free to just enjoy the humor."
3,"Good, but Watch Out!","I actually found that this play did a good job of making a rather difficult play accessible. I was particularly impressed with the way Leontes was played ... just verging on madness, and still somewhat sympathetic.Warning though: The ""Shepherd's Interlude"" is extremely bawdy. This is *not* a play to show young people without editing that part out. I have no idea why such a fine play in so many other ways resorted to such a low and vulgar interpretation, as it is not necessary to Shakespeare's play nor toward making the scene funny. So, beware if you are planning to show this to kids (as I embarrassingly did) without viewing it first and marking where you want to cut and jump scenes."
2,unappealing and unmagical,"Sadly, this is not the kind of performance that is required for this late romance of Shakespeare. It is prosaic, with unattractive sets and in a wholly inappropriate vaguely 19th century setting and costuming. The acting is also a bit over-emphatic. Thus, the fantasy and suspension of belief required of oracles and lost princesses and restored queens clashes constantly with the more realistic setting. I hope someday someone can capture a beautiful stage production of this play as well as Cymbeline, Pericles, Tempest and Measure. To see a well done late Shakespeare quasi-comedy see Twelfth Night directed by Trevor Nunn with Bonham Carter, Stubbs etc."
4,The French Line/Gentlemen Marry Brunettes C.D.,"Though not the best I've ever heard, I can't say that it was the worst either. The songs are good. However, the quality of the recordings is a little less than good. Since the movies that the songs came from on far from good movies, a person would not expect to hear good songs come off of this recording. However, the songs are rather enjoyable and worth listening to numerous times. I thoroughly enjoy this C.D. and it has provided hours of listening enjoyment. A must have for all the Jane Russell fans out there and her only recording, as of now, on C.D."
4,Good value,"I intend to use this for something it may not have been designed for--water instead of oil. Thus, the item will rust and the seals might wear out. I live in the desert in Arizona and have my own well. When power goes out, I have no water. So I have 55-gallon barrels of water and this will be my pump. I had long looked for a pump with the threads for a water hose and this is the only one I've found. This pump appears very sturdy. I kept the seals oiled with silicon lubricant, but it got rusty after leaving it in a barrel of rain water. So I now dry it out after each use and I think it'll be okay."
4,Great Teacher,don't think there's anyone else out there you should learn fingerstyle blues from. Stefan is a great teacher in this field.
1,Not like the soundtracks,"The songs on this CD are nothing like the Matrix soundtracks. Their relatively slow beats and word-heavy songs make them more like listening to someone read poetry to the beat of a bongo than the fast-paced music from the movie. If you liked the movie soundtracks because of their fast-paced techno themes and (sometimes) operatic choruses, don't buy this CD."
3,Inspired music not from the movies,"it's a inspired music from the movie however i did't like so much could be better by far, maybe other electronic musciand are way better"
5,I love this CD,"This is the best I have ever heard in this genre of CD music. The music is out of this world....very intense. Very different in a great way! I hope Zednanreh will be releasing more stuff like this. He captures the feeling of the movie very well. He is more unique than the soundtracks are. They just give the standard run of the mill ""artists of the month"" to sell the CD's.It helped me to understand the content of the movie even better.I highly recommend this not only to matrix fans, but fans of 2012 prophecy and global conspiracy theorists as well. Lovers of chill out, techno, and house - even industrial will also praise this cd."
4,Great Concept: Matrix philosophy explored!!!!!!!,"I thought this was a great record. It has more dimension than the soundtrack. A record ""inspired"" by a movie is not supposed be a carbon copy.....for that by the original. I am assuming if you are matrix fan, you already have the original soundtracks. Why would you need two? I feel the point of this record was to explore the THEMES of the films, not be a rip off of the music already done. IT did just that...However if you lack the depth; a philosophical piece like this is not for you. GREAT CD!!!!"
4,Space Age Boogie Woogie,"Smooth tip sailin on a supernova. Check this hot and heavy cosmic meltdown of ambient and new age fusion. Guaranteed to make your booty shake and yer johnson stiff. Sit back and buckle up, and fire up the one zinger as you embark on a journey to the outer cosmos. This is one electric boogaloo thats gonna make you wish you were a reptile."
4,"WHERE IS THE DUB MIX OF ""Release Yourself""???","this is a good compilation, and showcases The Aleem's at their prime, but where is the dub mix of ""Release yourself""????This was a HUGE oversight, as the mister magic dub mix was the one played in all the clubs, and even the radio. The regular vocal mix was hardly ever played, but is included here in it's inferior glory.The dry alternate mix of ""confusion"" is nice to hear, but not essential.The other tracks (with previously unheard mixes) are nice to have, but nothing special either.Tracks 8 & 9 are of bad sound quality (bad mixing), and as songs are not very strong overall.I give the comp 4 stars for all the other great tracks on it."
2,Disappointed,"While the songs on this CD are what I expected,the artists singing them are not.I thought when I purchased this that the songs were performed by the artists I hear singing them on the radio.I was wrong.Some are but several are not.Example...The Way You Love Me is not sung by Faith Hill on this CD.It just isn't the same.I am very disappointed with this selection!!"
1,Not worth the Money,"I wondered when I bought this if it was preformed by the original artists and was told it was. They were wrong! If you read the CD case they mention none of the singers names, now you will learn why. Heavy instrumentation helps drown out the singers which helps. Save your money and hope ""NOW 10"" comes out with country albums."
3,Durable Yet Not a great pad,You can drop a lit smoke on this and it wont melt or burn. Thats about the only upside as this thing just isn't slippery enough to be considered a good gaming pad. Use it for abusive environments but stick with other gaming pads for competition.
2,Very repetitive,"This is a story that needs to be told and I was very excited to read about this history. Unfortunately, I thought the writer was very repetitive in the telling of the history. His format for telling the story and history left allot to be desired and became very hard for me to continue reading. What he wrote in the forward was pretty much what he kept repeating throughout each chapter. You had to look for the ""nuggets"" of new information. I am half way through the book and plan to put it down for awhile and pick it back up to finish."
5,excellent history overview,"I really enjoyed reading the history about the Black pullman porters. It was a history I knew nothing about. I also thought that A. Phillip Randolph had been a pullman porter. The book was an eye opener about the history of the era. I think it's a must read for all americans, so that we realize the struggles of Blacks and how long they lasted and how much predjudice still exist today."
4,Stunning Achievement,"Tye's bio on Satchel Paige was a disappointment. Its plodding and badly-organized narrative managed to bury Mr. Page when it didn't make him dull.This account of the Pullman porter is riveting from the first page.Nineteenth century industry, race relations, and an expose' of some of the humbugs of the perpetually aggrieved modern race-pimps -- all these are deftly spread out before the reader.Were Pullman's porters saints of forebearance and determination? Perhaps. Were they aware they were the vanguard of the Black Middle Class I knew in Detroit in 1940? Probably not. Yet they managed their quiet triumph and Tye has done us all a service with this book."
4,fascinating historical connections...,"...and stories. that's why i recommend this book, altho my interest flagged toward the end. then i heard mr. tye talk at my public library, and the book took on a new perspective. he was so warm toward invited guests and welcoming to others who introduced themselves as pullman porter relatives. it was genuinely thrilling! Plus, an added bonus: pullman sleeping car and dining car scenes from old movies like hitchcock's ""north by northwest"" and 1949's ""all the king's men"" now take on extra meaning and importance. thanx, mr. tye."
3,Where have all the proofreaders gone?,"On the same page I read that Pullman porters travelled to all 50 states and that they were beacons in their churches. How do you get to Hawaii on a train? At my church, we call the leaders deacons."
5,Very pleasently surprised,"I picked this book up expecting to acquire a working knowledge of how XML is used in the building of corporate portals. I anticipated wading through a myriad of coding examples and references to this ERP and to that language. I thought I would find a logical road map of how to use my company's metadata and XML to open new arenas in the realm of e-commerce. I was anticipating an academic treatise. I was pleasantly surprised when I found that the title of the book was somewhat misleading. The book is actually a text constructed to educate the reader on the design, development and functionality of corporate portals. If you are looking for a book that you will be able to refer to as a guide to acquire a better understanding of corporate portals, I would highly suggest this book. It is both educational and enjoyable to read. But, if you are searching for a book to function as a technical journal that focuses only on metadata and XML, you should look elsewhere"
1,What a waste!,"This book wastes quite a few things, very respected names like Finkelstein, Aiken and Zachman and lots of pages. It will waste your time as well. This book is a vague attempt on connecting XML with information engineering."
2,Disappointed,"This book assumes you already are knowledgable in most areas. Wanted to know more about XML and portals. Actually, found nothing useful. Very little about XML. Examples and guide are for a portal someone else already built. I don't want someone else's portal."
1,The Insider's Guide to Making Money in Real Estate: Smart Steps to Building Your Wealth Through Property,"This Dolf de Roos book is no different from his other books, owning one is the same as owning all. Writes about same topics and ideas. Good author, trying to sell more books by using different titles.If you don't own any of his books, worth the $20 or so for the book. However, if you do...don't waste your money/positive cash flowHappy investing"
2,Just Okay,I was a little disappointed in this book. There isn't much new information that I didn't know already. The information presented wasn't in-depth enough. It's good for people who are getting introduced to real estate.
3,"Good unit, horrible packing","This seems to be an attractive and useful fridge, but it arrived in the worst possible packing imaginable for something like this: there was *no* space between the box and the fridge inside, and no packing materials to cushion against shipping damage. In other words, any blows to the box are blows to the fridge. As you can imagine shipping something of this size, some rough handling is guaranteed.Ours arrived with two really huge dents. Luckily the dents do not impact operation so we probably won't mess with the hassle of a return. But be aware that getting a unit shipped to you in perfect condition seems really unlikely with this brain-dead packing."
3,Fridge Review,"this fridge it a bit too big and bulky, I should have gone with a small size since I am using it for my office.The fridge arrived pretty banged up. There were a couple of dents in it and it wouldn't stand up straight until I straightened out a metal piece on the bottom."
2,"Arrived damaged, short-lifespan","This item arrived with a big dent in the front door. I decided to keep it, rather than go through the hassle of shipping it back. After one year, it is now DEAD. The compressor is shot and it does not cool. I should have paid more for a better model."
1,Poor Customer Service,"I have had a bad experience with this company. My refrigerator just stopped working. I emailed them and asked where i should take it for service. It is only 6 months old. They had me to send in the model number and I did. It has been 1 month now and they will not return my emails. I do believe they are dropping me and not taking care of their product. I would stay clear, so sad...pretty refrigerator, but needs to work."
3,Can a fridge be TOO cold?,"The answer is a most definite yes. This thing actually runs too cold for me, oddly enough. If I put it above anything other than about a one (or between the 1 and off even), it'll freeze stuff or at the very least make them get semi-frosted. Also the freezer portion seems a bit wonky. The door (or what I presume to be it anyways) doesn't properly match up with the shape of the freezer section and also has no way to close on it. I've had to hold it closed with duct tape in fact. Otherwise it's a pretty good fridge for the size and price.This could perhaps all be because I bought it refurbished, so it's possible that a new one will not have these problems with it."
4,great fridge,"keeps everything nice and cold, freezer is perfect for those reeses peanut butter cups. had it delivered to my office and the guys in the mailroom even brought it right up to the 8th floor too, all i had to do really was plug it in! great buy!"
3,Disapointed,"The fridge came with the door unattached, which is no big deal. So I screw the door on myself, but it hangs too low and hits the floor and doesn't close without lifting it up. When I called the manufacturer they said I had to go to a hardware store to purchase a spacer. I don't understand why it didn't come with one. Then the clip to hold the wire for the freezer was loose in the fridge and the wire was hanging. I had to figure out where it was supposed to be attached and how the clip held the wire in place without any directions. The manufacturer said it was supposed to come already attached. I finally figured it out and luckily it works, because I didn't want to have to return it since the box arrived without a bottom. Other than that, the fridge works fine. But I would have liked for better directions, better assembly, and parts that actually came with the product."
4,Works well so far,"I just got this item today.Pros: Good deal for a affordable price. I plugged my in this morning and its cold enough. Though i havent stored much in there, i think it will do the job. Its pretty quiet and i hardly noticed the noise. It will shrugg once in a while but thats about it.Cons: Packaging. I got a big dent on the corner. I already sent a pic to Amazon in my feedback. This i guess is the only negative thing for this item.Overall, i think its high time that Amazon took some responsibility for this and act as a advocate for its customers. With such poor packaging, i think its highly unlikely to receive the item in an undamaged condition."
5,My Favorite Children's Book Ever,"I recently was asked the question,""What's your favorite children's book?"" on a survey. This was an obvious choice for me. I can still recite most of the monster's rhymes by heart 20 years later. I bought Mercer Mayer's new Professor Wormbog book for my niece a few month's back because it has all of the same characters."
2,expected better,"I was rather disappointed with Gabry Ponte's solo album. I feel his talents are best combined with the efforts of the other two members of Eiffel 65. The first track on the album, ""Man In The Moon"" was great! However, that was it! That song seemed like it belonged on a different album as far as style and mood. I purchased this album based on the fact that Eiffel 65 has always put out great music and knowing that Ponte was a part of that music, I assumed this solo album would be a sure bet. No such luck! Not a good album and not recommended!"
4,Gabry's first solo album,"WOW! It looks like I'm the first to send my oppinions about this! I'm a very crazy fan of Eiffel 65 and now that Gabry (the group's DJ) has just released his first solo album, all I can say is good luck to him! May Gabry have just as much sucess with this album as with the trio's."
1,"Chemical smell, not a very engaging story for kids","The story does not hold a child's attention well, and the illustrations are somewhat difficult for a young baby to ""see"" and pick out on the page. The product itself absolutely reeks of phthalates - that plasticky chemical almost gasoline smell. It worried me that my baby just wanted to chew on this chemical-smelling product."
4,a good place to start,"His rooms are lovely to look at, but I can see how his style would not be for everyone. Personally, I would hate to have to sweep and dust any of them. They are ""overstuffed"", with no room even to push the furniture aside and have a bit of a dance if the mood takes you. A bit stifling for me, but his basic theories are very logical and practical. Worth a read. (I have never seen his television show)."
3,Great for Christopher fans,"This book is basically a detailed version of Christopher's new season of shows. It takes each room he does on the show, and explains the ""how tos,"" to creating his signature style. The photography is beautiful and the copy is done in Chris' upbeat conversational tone. The drawback to this book is that it does not discuss styles other than the ""Christopher Lowell"" style - if you watch the show, you know that almost every room he does has a certain look about it - dark colors, highly decorated, lots of fabric, etc. That said, if you like the show, you'll love this book. The bathroom redo and the child's room were stand outs."
2,Limited in number of ideas and range of styles,"Like too many decorating books on the market right now, this book seems more about this author's own style than about how the readers can find and carry out their own style. As a designer working for clients who have a wide range of style goals, I find this disappointing. This TV personality's design range is narrow, at best, and there are not very many rooms or projects in the book, once you get into it. I look for books to give or loan to clients to help thtem get a grasp of all the possibilties and of the basics of design, and this book is NOT one that I can use in my work. I recommend The New Decorating Book, which is broad in style and which explains design in ways that anyone can understand."
5,Great book!,"This book is a great reference guide. If you are an avid watcher of the TV show, all of this information is a repeat. However, I found it nice to have in print so I could refer to it as often as needed."
1,Of no help at all,"This is the kind of book that gives decorating a bad name. Instead of talking about good design, he digs right in to ""decorating,"" which in this case means layering on the junk. One shouldn't start with paint (or fabric) or anything of the sort. Good design begins with good over all use of space. It's only after one decides how a room will be used and gets the basic furnishings in place to carry out that function that one can -- at the END, not the beginning -- put the finishing touches on in the form of color, texture, and so on. I think Mr. Lowell would make a good cake decorator, but a designer he's not."
1,Not worth the money,"Actually, I did not pay for this book, because a friend gave it to me as a shower gift, but the book is not worth the money because its content is so limited. I get the feeling that the author was trying to stretch his material because as another reviewer mentioned you see the same room again and again. I guess some people buy this thin book because the author is said to have a TV show, but I work and have never seen it, so I'm not sure of this author's qualifications."
2,"Love the show, not the book","I am a fan of Christopher Lowell's TV show, because it is such fun to watch. The book makes me realize that he's fun on TV but probably not a great design authority. The rooms he would have us create are too-too. Looking at my friends' homes and at my own, what I see is that we have too much darned stuff. And we talk about needing to clean up the clutter and simplify our surroundings so that we can relax. Mr.Lowell seems to want us to add something everywhere we look. I guess I am looking for something more sophisticated than what this book can teach me. One thing that scares me is how many of my less-than-talented friends are going to use this book as a license to junk up their homes."
2,You've seen it all on the TV show,"If have watched the show at all in the last year, you've seen something from this book. It is missing the freshness and creativity that his show once had. I wonder how much of the material stemmed from freebies from retailers.Christopher Lowell is a creative guy, capable of much better. I gave it 2 stars out of loyalty for the years of watching the show."
4,Easy and Complete Decorating Approach,"Love this book. It breaks down the elements of decorating in a way that is easy to follow yet effective. More importantly to me..this book gave me enough guidance and encouragement to break free of my very, very tall white walls! I followed his advice on color selection and coordination and the results were great!"
4,Help for the decorating dazed and confused,"I enjoy Christopher Lowell's television show, and found his book equally terrific! The advice about interviewing and working with an interior decorator is worth the cost of the book by itself. The projects are challenging but definitely add to your home's look without putting you in the poorhouse. The best thing about Christopher Lowell? He starts with *paint*. Paint is cheap, and can simply be painted over without incurring thousands in re-dos and ""buying mistakes."" Paint also makes a huge impact, and you don't have to change furniture or buy expensive accessories.It's not brain surgery, but home decorating can reduce the most self-assured woman to a tearful wreck. This book can either be followed to the letter or used as a springboard to other decorating books and magazines. Christopher's breezy writing style and easily understood explanations make the most fearful home decorator ready to finally pick up that paintbrush and get busy!"
5,A not so serious book for those serious about decorating,"If you can only buy one book on decorating, this is the one. Mind you, I am writing this as a total neophyte decorator. I bought a fixer upper and had never decorated before in my life. Christopher seems to have taken all of the thought work out of decorating and left you with the fun. I especially love his recipe for picking colors. I've followed it for my living room, hallways and bedroom. They look absolutely fabulous. Doing that gave me enough confidence to venture further on my own with color and voila- I have a beautiful and happy house. Mind you I am still in the process, but so far he's been right on with everything he's said, from ceilings to floors.Oh, and this is a totally FUN read. Not too wordy and definitely not boring. This is written by someone who has found his niche and LOVES it."
2,Not enough information,"I found that Mr. Lowell did not explain enogh about why he was suggesting his various projects and ideas. Without understanding that, I either have to apply the ideas exactly as he shows them or look elsewhere for background information on decorating that will help me understand the principles of design. As an attorney, I am used to working with that kind of logic. Give me a conclusion or an idea and then explain how you arrived at it. It's the knowing of how one has arrived at the idea that allows others to learn from it. As I see it, this book is all about simply applying this or that idea (and applying lots of ""decorating"" to surfaces, from walls to windows) without understanding how one arrives at a decision to do so."
4,I've got some Drama for Ya!,"Of all the home shows on T.V., Christopher Lowell is by far the best of the best. I bought his book and used it as a guide to decorate my home. The results were beyond my expectations.Just click the link to see the photos.<a href=""http://kelleybell.blogspot.com/2006/01/adorable.html"">DRAMA</a>"
2,A little restraint please,"Don't get carried away with Lowell's ideas. He's fun to watch on TV but be careful of the taste level, which isn't always high. His work seems to come from the school of clutter, because he leaves no surfaces untouched. Everything is ""decorated"" and loaded with too much color, pattern, froufrou and too many objects. Take some of his good ideas but use a little restraint and be a little less theatrical when doing your own home. Once in awhile, it's nice to leave a little breathing room."
1,Disappointing,"Christopher Lowell (the Richard Simmons of decorating) may be fun to watch on TV, but his appeal does not translate to books. He's an entertainer. The book turned out to be terribly lacking in content with several pages devoted to one project or idea. One gets the feeling that he was stretching limited content. I felt cheated when I got this book because there wasn't much in it. And his message of being free to do your own thing is found in virtually every good decorating book these days. Nothin' to see here!"
3,"""Love that!""","This book is the result of workshops taught by Lowell and his disciplines in a dreamy area of Ohio, Chagrin Falls. Crafty Lowell captured the decorating essence of some 3,000 graduates of his classes, preserving the student's talents and successes and putting that energy into a medium for disbursal, documentary footage. And, thus, the enterprise Christopher Lowell was born, and christened through the hit television program of the same name on the Discovery Channel.This book is about selective stylings based on seven basic design decor layers. The photography is good, Christopher's personality shines through in the copy, but again, it is narrow in project choice and relies on basic information. I was impressed with the kitchen revamp."
4,Good Introduction to Design,This book arrived quickly and in excellent condition. The information was clearly presented and helpful for getting started on redecorating.
2,Disappointing,"I love Christopher Lowell's TV show, but this book leaves much to be desired. Considering its size and price, it doesn't have that much in it. He takes one room or project and stretches it out instead of showing more projects or variations on the theme. It's more like a long magazine article than a book."
1,Self-levels...YES...but is it level....NO!!!,"I got this out of the box and the instructions say that's its calibrated from the factory....well to my suprise...it wasn't. In fact after going through the calibration procedures...I never could get it calibrated..and to make things worse..If I did nothing more than turn the unit off and turn it back on, without disturbing the unit, the laser line was no where close to where it was prior to turning it off...and if you bumped the unit while on...it dosen't return to the natural horizontal positon that it should...it would skew off and stay there..so In my opinion...stay away from this and but one from a more reputable company..such as CST, David White, and Topcon...It's junk and can't believe that Porter Cable would back this product up.."
2,"Okay, but definetely for the homeowner","Bought it for my company. It's a great price, so if your doing home projects or if you're a serious DIY'er I'd recomend it. If your a pro, I'd either rent a true industrial grade laser, or step up to something like a Spectra, a Dewalt, or a Topcon... I think they'll be much more durable -- especially around the jobsite. Just my 2-cents"
5,the BEST .... guys with one star rating are NUTS and handicapped!,Have used this laser level for 3 years now. VERY accurate. VERY easy to use. Installed a septic leach field just recently and was PERFECT. I too am an architect and am not sure what was wrong with the other architect except that perhaps he is from New Hampshire! Liberals don't like to follow instructions!
5,Great book,"Offers excellent advice. Has sections on how to respond to almost any question, which is very helpful. Highly recommend it!"
2,Shallow,"This book of 224 could be condensed to 124 without losing anything but the author's repetition of certain phrases. Some of the strategies mentioned are worthwhile, if a bit common sense (i.e. don't say a weakness that will disqualify you from the job--duh!), but most of the book is fluff.And the 500 questions? More like 30 or so. The author groups maybe 50 questions together at the start of each chapter, questions that are virtually identical (""What is your main weakness?"", ""Where do you see room for improvement in yourself?"" ""If I asked a coworker, what negative thing would he say about yourself?"") and then a common strategy is proposed for all of them (which almost always consists of ""don't say something that would disqualify you from the job.""The only positives in this book are some of the insights drawn from his experiences in headhunting life. Some of the strategies are good, but common sensical."
2,Apple Mash,By the time you are one third of the way through this casebook you will be perturbed with each mention of apple mash flowing passed Country Lodge. To the authors: be a little creative and come up with more than one illustrative problem.Some of the cases seemingly were included only to add pages or the authors included an excerpt far in excess of what was needed.
3,Cute,Cute book. Admittedly it took me half the book to warm up to the stories and keep everyone straight - the author jumps from paragraph to paragraph with each different character. I thought the end was a bit anticlimactic.
2,listen to the samples,"Clearly very talented and accomplished on a most difficult instrument, but too soon to record IMHO. -for one, too many student-ish ""cat like"" slides. Listen to the first Chopin sample...decide for yourself, of course-these slides won't be a bother for everyone for sure."
5,There is more than meets the eye!,"This CD explores the causes and effects of the 1692 Salem Witch trials at several levels by using the metaphor of a Treasure Hunt through Beverly & Salem, Massachusetts. It is an entertaining history lesson with clever music/lyrics and can be enjoyed at that level. It also asks/cautions the listener to think about the Spiritual meaning of evil and how people can be mislead by religious fervor (the Devil's deception). Modern Science can not protect us from evil if we refuse to use it -- Witness the Talibahn. Even the meaning of Truth can be debated as (turgidly) presented in ""The Whys behind the hows"" by Mitroff & Turoff...I will go on the journey through Beverly and Salem if I have the opportunity."
1,Absolute garbage!!,"This guitar player has absolutely no feel. He is a complete noodler. Reading the other reviews, I am wondering how a seventh grader knows when to use the word ""susinctly"" in the appropriate spot. These guys aren't even good enough to play at weddings! Save your money. Half wit musicians!"
5,the best,"Frank Scanzani is my teacher. He does not seem like the type to be in a rock band to tell you the truth, so I desided to get this tape to see if he really could play. I found out he could! This is not olny a great tape for the music but it is a great tape for people with interest in the history in witch craft. US must of put a lot of reaearch into this tape, for they have all the correct imformation about the history. ROCK ON MR. SCANZ!!"
3,Entertaining and wholesome,"I found this little book to be enjoyable and entertaining. This is quality Christian fiction. Sure the plot is just a bit far-fetched, and the atheist character is more a caricature than a character with depth, but the main characters are believable. The book contains nothing offensive, that is, nothing except murder which is not glorified. Although not stated the church in which the story takes place is apparently a Protestant church, but the Catholic G. K. Chesterton is praised herein. Anti-abortion activity is mentioned in passing with sympathy. I recommend this book for elementary, middle and high school libraries, especially Christian schools."
