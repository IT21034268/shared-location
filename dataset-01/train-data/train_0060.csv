3,Original movie was the best,"The black and white verions, the original version, was far better then the later one with Reeve's. I think the black and white gave it more sinister viewing."
4,British Science Fiction At Its Best!,"Watch a fine cast of English actors keep up stylish upper lips as they confront a mass impregnation by fierce aliens. It's the original film adaptation of the book ""The Midwich Cuckoos."""
4,Works perfectly for me,"It's now 2007 and I bought this projector in 2003 and it's still running strong. I use it to watch TV and DVDs. About half a year ago the bulb popped and I had to replace it. This was expected to happen at some point, but HP doesn't make it very easy to order the bulb online, you have to call and then they can't find the part etc.. And it was quite expensive ($500). The only other complaint I have is the noise level of the fan. Ohter than that it runs perfectly and very reliably and has never failed me."
3,a bit too grating for me...,"Ok, so I love the music to this song, and i love the lyrics and the message behind it. I just hate the chanting ""I hate you so much right now!"". Very aggitating. This single is not worth purchasing if you plan on buying the album because the only difference on the mix is about two minutes of extra beats. So if you do enjoy this song, heck go pick it up, but myself, i will be giving my copy to someone else."
3,Duplicates material in Pimsleur Quick & Simple Brazilian Portuguese,"Unfortunately, in the Instant Conversation CD set the Pimsleur company duplicates the material contained in the Quick & Simple CD set. If you already own the Quick & Simple set, it is largely a waste of money to purchase the Instant Conversation set."
4,Well acted historical biography,The abdication is based on the life of Queen Christina of Sweden. It tells of her giving up the throne of Sweden and travelling to Rome to meet the Pope and become a Catholic. The film depicts her relationship with Cardinal Azzolino which according to historical reports (not shown in the film) lasted a lifetime. It is well acted by both Liv Ullman and Peter Finch. The film made me want to learn more of the life of Christina.
5,Grupo Sexo is better than masterbating,"Seriously you cant go wrong, if you like good music thi is for you. Manic Hispanic took famous punk songs and sexed them up with Mexican spice. A backwards cover band where the music reminds the listener of the original but the lyrics are fresh from the hearts of the band. A fantasic tribute to the original with unique flare."
1,The Sunken Sailor Stinks,"Don't waste any of your time with this ""novel"": an exercise in serial silliness by 14 indifferent ""masters of suspense"", who only provide a melange of malaprops and a collection of cliches."
5,Much nicer than expected for the price,I was surprised at how nice the keychain looked for the cost. It was hard to find an American flag keychain in stores so was glad to find one online that looks so nice.
2,buy a different Merle Haggard compilation,"to get a good quality, single-disc collection of the original recordings of some of Merle Haggard's greatest music, ""20 Greatest Hits"" on the Capitol/EMI label is good, as is the budget cd ""Best of the Best"" also on Capitol (avoid similarly titled releases on different labels)...to really do Merle Haggard's legacy justice, easily the best single purchase currently available is the multi-label box set compilation called ""Down Every Road"""
4,Great Shaver for the Price,"The Wahl 7367-500 works great. I use the meduim head attachment and I get a very close and smooth shave just like my last Wahl which died after 4 years of use. I don't consider my last Wahl shaver lasting 4 years to be a problem given the price. One thing though, the side burn trimmer is very loud and it can be quite disturbing to hear first thing in the morning. I'm sure I'll get use to it though. For the price this is a Great shaver!"
3,"Made in USA, but needs improvement","Pros;1. Made in the US,2. Three choices for the replacement screens depending on skin type,3. Inexpensive replacement screens & cutters if ordered direct from Wahl (double advantage)Cons;1. Only fair trimmer. While better then the Braun design, this isn't as good as the Remington Microscreen version,2. Uses a ineffecient 'brick' transformer as opposed to a switching design which is what most of the better devices are using now. It's not heavy, but it is still a old style transformer,3. Doesn't seem to cut as well as the Remington, but better than the single head Braun. I perfer a head that is at a 90 degree angle to the body, not a 45 degree as this is,4. That separate round trimmer didn't really impress me.5. Non repleceable battery (?).Summery; With some modifications it would be a good shaver."
3,i like whal i have six more.,no head cover. the head stick when you try yo take it off. this is not good for any man that shave.
2,Prodcut is way too noisy and too loud,"I received the ordered Wahl Shave System, but the ""Foil Guard"" was not included in the shipment. I would like Amazon.com and/or Wahl Clipper Corporation to send me a ""foil Guard"" that is missing from the shipment. I do not have anything to cover the Foil Head of my shaver.Secondly, this product is way too loud when it is turned on for operation. I am thinking of returning this product for REFUND. The product does not live up to the way its performance is described."
5,Wahl System 4000 Razors,"I have been using this product for a number of years, and am just preparing to buy the third. I wore out the first two. After two other brands of rechargeable razors, plus many traditional razors and shave creams, the System 4000 just cuts my beard more closely than any other product. My wife does not get scratched from my tough beard stubble, and that is the final test. The charge holds for about 5 days, so on travel I carry the stand-up charger. The pop-up trimmer works great. My only concern is that Wahl may some day stop making electric razors then what would I do?"
1,A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"AFTER READING ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS ON THIS WAHL SHAVER I DECEIDED TO BUY ONE ON 6-9-2010. THREE WEEKS LATER THE ATTACHED TRIMMER LITERALLY FELL APART. I CONTACTED AMAZON AND THEY IMMEDIATELY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT. AFTER LESS THEN ONE WEEK OF USING THE NEW REPLACEMENT THE SHUT OFF SWITCH DIDN'T WORK. THE ONLY WAY IT WOULD SHUT OFF WAS BY LETTING THE BATTERY RUN OUT. WITH TWO WAHL SHAVERS GOING BAD IN LESS THEN A MONTH, THERE WON'T BE A THIRD. I'M RECEIVING A FULL REFUND AS OF 7-9-2010. ALSO TAKE NOTE THAT ""AMAZON SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT THOUGHOUT THESE PROBLEMS AND AMAZON WAS WHO I BOUGHT IT THOUGH"". ALSO TAKE NOTE, I CONTACTED WAHL AND FOUND THEIR COMPANY LACKING AMAZON SERVICE."
3,"Great shaver, but.......the trimmer sucks.","Before this shaver I had a Wahl 4400 for 6-7 years. Loved everthing about it. The charger ended up going bad and I thought it was the shaver. Oh well. The 4400 still works great with the charger from the new one. So I ordered the new one and it shaves great too. However, the trimmer part sucks. I think the blades are too far apart and not sharp so it grabs hair and skin. The trimmer is pretty much unuseable. I use the trimmer on the old 4400. I would not recommend this shaver is you use a trimmer at all."
4,A Good Shaver for the price,"I just ordered my second Wahl 4000 shaver. I'm replacing a Wahl 4000 with a weak battery - it's been two years - it'll be a good spare once I get around to replacing the battery. Yes, the battery life could be longer, but overall it's a good shaver for the price. It shaves close, and I never get razor burn. I pulled out an old Remington I keep as a spare and I was surprised how much better the Wahl performs."
5,works as advertised,This product is the best shaver that I have used so far and I have bought a few. It provides a very close and clean shave.Very nice product
4,Wahl Shaver,"This is my third Wahl Shaver, I stay with Wahl because it's the only one I have found with a screen with holes that are big enough to do the job right for me. I use the super close screen, the other Wahl screens and the several other brands shavers I have tried and returned, have smaller holes and I have to shave twice as long and still don't get as good a shave.Maybe this is unique to me but I doubt it. I would think the other brands would do a little research and development and come out with more screen choices also."
1,Still pulls my whiskers,"I used a Wahl 7040-614 Custom Shave 5000 for several years and never had any problems with it pulling my whiskers. Wahl has discontinued that model. I have tried 3 different Wahl models that are now in production and they ALL pull. I never know when it is going to do it but it pulls about every other time I used it. I sent one back to Amazon and got a refund and took one back to a dealer. I am getting tired of sending them back so I will just put this one in a drawer and leave it there. I am now using a Gillette safety razor. I think it is called the Mach3. It dose a great job and I will continue to use it. I will not buy another Wahl unless I can find the older ""Custom Shave 5000"""
3,not bad but,This is a very good electric razor. But I have a very thick beard and sharp jawline....I am also trying to go electric from expensive blades..... the transition has taken a few weeks for the upper part of my face.... but is not working at all for my neck...... If you are in this boat ....you may need to purchase a more expensive razor to get the job done otherwise......... it is truly great for the money....
3,item not made perfect,"The product was satisfactory . . . BUT there is something wrong, i.e. the shaver head is hard to release when pushing the button, and the protective plastic covering the head gets caught up on the trimmer blade when trying to remove the protective covering."
1,Let's Tear Down This Wahl,"HiI bought this shaver based on customer reviews,,So much for trusting anonymous reviews.. First of all it's cheaply made.....Motor is loud and slow compared to good shavers...had to glue charger together with super glue... one head on personal trimmer was broke.......poor quality shave even with the closest head it's not close.....takes 15 hours of charging for a few minutes of shaving....If this truly is the last American made shaver it's a sad commentary on what we are turning out......Try a Braun Free Control for a foil Shaver or a Norelco for rotory and forget this junk.....well the first shave wasn't too bad and it's all down hill from there."
3,"Super Shaver, Terrible Trimmer","I bought the Wahl 4000 to replace an older Wahl model that I loved because it cost less than replacing the cutters and screen. The 4000 shaver seems to effortlessly suck the hair off your face without any sensation but, the trimmer is about as useful as a dull butter knife to remove hairs too long for the shaver. So, I'm still using the trimmer portion of my old Wahl."
4,"Dependable, good shave","I have owned several Wahl shavers over the years and decided to replace my old one with this unit. Works great and nice close shave. It is a little noisier than the old one, but it's not too bad. However, the nose hair trimmer is flimsy and made in China."
5,Wahl products are still the standard.,This purchase was to replace my Dynaflex shaver which I have used for 13 years with only one repair. The grip of the 4000 is better than before and I would recomend it for anyone that prefers a foil razor.
4,Great Shaver,The Wahl shaver works wonderfully. I've had mine since mid-January. The battery life is pretty good-used it for 2 1/2 weeks before charging(every other day NOT everyday). Its a close shave and the attached trimmer is really sharp and works great for getting those pesky odd hairs and for trimming the mustache.There are a few drawbacks:The attached trimmer is more difficult than it should be to open.This shaver is LOUD. Its louder than the clippers I use to cut my hair!The charging base is rather shoddy and comes apart easily.Besides that its a great shaver and I highly recommend it.I have no comment on the personal trimmer as I have yet to use it.
3,Shaver As Close To Perfect As Its Shave,"Never having used a shaver before, I was amazed how close a shave I was able to get with this product, which I use after cutting the long hairs with a beard trimmer."
2,Not for Sensitive Skin,"I know that this product works for some, but for me it did not. That is why I decided to return it. Wahl makes great products, but this product was not for me. My skin was too sensitive and the machine irritated it."
1,Never Got It!,I never got it. It was sent to my son-in-law and he never got it. No one signed for it.
1,waste of money,"it's a torture to use this product, I would rather use a shaving cream and a shaving blade to finish the job faster."
1,WAHL ELECTRIC RAZOR,THE BEARD TRIMMER FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK. I WISH I COULD SEND IT BACK BUT I THREW AWAY THE PACKAGING. HOW DID THIS LEMON GET OUT OF THE FACTORY?
5,Great Shaver!,I have owned other razors but Wahl is still my favorite! It includes 3 foils which makes it a great deal!
1,Get what you pay for.,Charged it like the directions said. Turned it on and used it for 5 minutes before it just shut off. Figured out that it would work if I jammed the button in but that's not how it's supposed to be and made it impossible to use. I don't recommend this brand.
4,"effective shaver, cheap body","my hubby decided, after trying a norelco, that he wanted a foil razor back and Wahl had always been good to him, so I bought this one. It's a great razor, but when he unpacked it, the bottom separated from it as if the glue wasn't there to hold it. He must have 'snapped' it back together, because he's shaving fine (which is what matters most to me!) and it's working well. He loves that he's able to use it both with or without a cord...which he couldn't with his last one."
3,Wahl Dynaflex 7367-500 (system 4000) shaver,"I purchased this shaver 6 weeks ago after being very happy with a Wahl 4400 which I retired after inexpensively rebuilding it myself several times over 6 years. The new shaver arrived quickly direct from Amazon and the price was right at $40.88 including shipping and instant promo discount. (It also included a bonus personal nose/ear trimmer of which I have a drawer full of and none work very well). The shave is great and powerful enough for a week's shaves on a single charge, but be aware that the powerful Wahl's are louder than other brands. Unfortunatly, the pop up trimmer snagged and pulled my sideburns and neck hair, so I returned it to Wahl for repair per their advice. I received it back 3 weeks later along with a spare foil I had requested (although not the exact one I requested) to offset my $10 return shipping cost. Sadly, the pop up trimmer still snags hair, therefore I can only recommend the shaver if the trimmer is not important to you."
3,Battery needs charging; otherwise ok.,The Wahl 7367-500 is a good product. I just happen to have one that needs excessive charging. Like once every two shaves. Otherwise an ok product.
4,Excellent Shaver,"This is my second Wahl 4000 (or 7367-500) Shaver. The first one is about 7 years old and still runs fine but the battery doesn't really hold its charge anymore. Since I had to keep it on the charger nightly in order to use it, I decided to get a new one. I highly recommend them...it's a good product."
3,"Great shaver, crappy foils","This shaver packs more power into a cordless shaver than I've ever gotten from a Panasonic or Norelco; it's powerful enough that holding it while shaving can numb your fingers from the motor's vibration. However, the shaver foils fail too soon, and usually while I'm shaving the top of my head, which means I end up getting a nice gash cut in my scalp about once a month.Wahl needs to put some R&D; into toughening up its foils. Be prepared to spend $15 a quarter on replacement foils."
4,Wonderfully fun Karaoke,It is a wonderful cd works great my only complaint is I wish it had more songs from both of them!!!
5,Portraits is the best book I have every read!,Portraits is the best book I have every read! It has very interesting characters that you care about. The plot is very involved and moves at a good pace. Portraits could be the story of my grandparents and great-parents because the theme is similiar in families who emigrated to this country at the turn of the century. The characters in Portraits are very believable and remind me of people that I know.
1,Too repetitious and too long.,"I love stories that take place over several generations, so I was prepared to like this book. The first half was OK, but the second half started to drag. By the last 100 pages I was speed reading just to get it over with. I like strong women characters who stand up for themselves, but Rachel, Doris and Lillian, the daughters of the awful Sara, took verbal abuse all though their childhood, and still kow-towed to Sara to the point I started skipping the same old dialogue over and over. Sara was one of the most unlikable charactors I've ever encountered in a novel like this. The book was repetitious in that each generation went thru the same thing, so if you read one generation's trials and woes, you could skip the rest and use your imagination."
1,I am afraid I didnt enjoy it that much. A bit of a let down,"I thought I would like it, but I was seriously let down. The story is indeed a good one, especially the struggle of women in this book, but unfortunately the plot was somewhat thin, and even important events were belittled or downgraded and were not entered into in detail. Has its fair share of tragedy which is good, but story line is frail and watered down."
1,Dizzy...,"Well...I am listening to this performance on naxos right now, and I am getting dizzy.... Every single phrase is pregnant with crescendos and rubatos...Sorry... Nothing else to add...Gave one star for fingers as always...or for effort I guess :)"
1,Do NOT waste your money,"I was so excited when I found this bottle on Amazon. My daughter is having a very hard time transitioning from the breast to the bottle and some of my friends with older kids have told me to buy the square nipple Playtex bottle. The picture and description make you believe that is what you are buying. WRONG. I received the bottle and it is just the regular platex nipple (brown, but not square nipple). It is total false advertising and makes me angry that I wasted money on something I will never use. It's not even worth the time to print out the return receipt and go to the post office to return it. Unless you just want to throw your money away, do not buy this."
3,Nipple is different from the ads,I'm breastfeeding and will be going back to work but my baby is being picky on his nipples. Im having a hard time switching him to bottles. My co worker shared her experience w/ this and her baby just love this. I order this expecting that I'll get same product description. But I end up receiving different kind of nipples and ordering another set of nipples which my co worker is talking about. Still waiting those from the mail.
4,Breast Fed babies,"Newborn is mainly breast fed but we try to do at least 1 bottle a day. He had issues takingother bottles, Our lactation consulatant reccomend this becuase the nipple is most like naturale and breast fed babies seem to do better with it, which was true with us."
1,Not what I ordered,I order this bottle for my daughter who is breast feeding and having a hard time getting the baby to take a bottle. I ordered this bottle because of the nipple. When I received this bottle it was not what I ordered. She already had the nipple that they sent with the bottle. I was very disappointed in this purchase. Not what I ordered I wanted the original nurser bottle with the original nipple like in the picture.
5,Excellent filter,I have had good results with Beck Arnley products in the past. Ordered this one as it has metal end plates inside (vs paper as in some other filters) and it is larger (ie more capacity) than the standard OEM or other brands.
3,Some songs not the original single versions,"I bought this CD for one song ""Get Wet's Just So Lonely"".It is the album version and not the original single version as claimed on the cover. The original single version does fade out before the funny change of key part at the end.Otherwise the CD is OK. I am still looking for the original single version of the song."
3,Daughter,"DaughterCan you imagine walking through the door after coming home from your school day and finding your mother hanging over the edge of the balcony getting ready to jump? Amy is going through a life changing experience with her mother. After several weeks of awkward behavior displayed by her mother she tries to convince her mother to go to the doctor to see what is going on with her. After going to the doctor's office her mother learns she is suffering from the disease Alzheimer's. Afraid to leave her mother was always on Amy's mind. If Amy was invited to a party or to go somewhere else with her friends she makes up a lie so that she can go home to her sickly mother.This story has a surprise ending so I don't want to give it a way so, if you are enjoy reading books about suspense you would probably like to read this book. I would recommend this book because it's the type of book that will keep your attention focused on the book and you wanting to turn the page."
5,A Incredible story,This book is about a fourteen year old girl named Sylvie. Her parents have been divorced for a few years but she has always been very close with her mother. For the last year her mother has been acting very strange. She forgets things and people very easily. But lately she has been very strange. When Sylvie approached her mother in a parking lot her mother thought that she was trying to mug her. Sylvie has no idea what is going on and is scared.This is a heat touching story of a young girl who deals with the difficulties of Alzheimer's Disease. This books is very interesting and slightly sad.
3,Item is just paper,"I thought that I could use this for a baby's room, but it's only paper and tape doesnt work well. I guess it's my own fault for assuming."
4,NICE INTRO,"Robert Kennedy was my very first hero as a child. This book for young readers will, I hope, introduce the succeeding generations to the man who would be president in 1968.I like the way the author highlights the salient points of the late Senator's life. Although this is not a comprehensive biography even for young standards, the author does a credible job of presenting the Senator in a favorable light. I was especially pleased that the Senator's focus on civil rights issues was emphasized.As with any work on Robert Kennedy, the reader is left with the aching, gaping question of what would have transpired in the intervening years had this good man been elected president in 1968."
5,An Awesome look at the backstage of SPICEWORLD!,"The Spiceworld Tour was the best world tour ever. In this video you get to see the Spice Girls zanny trip through America and what kinds of adventure they found. This video is packed with laughs and a good look at the Spice Girls as they really are (but we already knew them as they really are didn't we). It is a bit sad to see the way the video ends, with the ending of the tour and such. This is a must for any Spice fan. We saw the tour from the audience, now see it from the stage!"
5,Spice4Life,This video was the best of the spice girls videos and movie i have ever seen!!! it is a cool video to watch!!! and if you went to the concerts of spice world1998 this video is for you!!!and i cant wait to see what other stuff is on its way..like the 3rd album due out in fall!!
4,SPICE UP YOUR LIFE,"This is a very real look into the Spice Girl's life. Not just as Scary, Baby, Posh, & Sporty but, as Melanie B, Emma, Victoria, & Melanie C. The real 4 girls behind the smoke and mirrors. So if you think you know the real Spicy 4. Think again!"
3,Spice Girls on tour,This is a Fantastic video thoughit isn't as good as Spiceworld video this is a video for spice girl fans who like everything about them.Posh and Ginger are my favourite spice girls.
3,3 stars is generous,"generally a good gun, but only 175 fps. this doesnt hurt at all. this is one of the most realistic uzis ive seen so i got this even though i could have gotten another uzi same price that looked unrealistic but had a bigger mag. the stock is adjustable and can even come off using a screw driver. runs off 4 AA batteries and sometimes gets jammed. mines jammed and still works but you just have to pull the trigger really hard.. even for 20 dollars not that great."
2,"Not a very good gun, but OK for beginners.","This was the first airsoft gun I ever bought, so I didn't know much about airsoft then. Looking at this gun now, I see it is a terrible gun. When I shoot it, it only goes about 20-30 feet, it's FPS is about 50 (Very slow), it only hold 40 rounds, and it has terrible accuracy. If you are looking for a gun for a beginner, this may be for you. but if not, stay away from this gun."
5,great,"Purchased this air soft gun as a gift for someone for Christmas. It is a great little gun! Works great, looks great!"
4,"Good for the money, eats batteries.","This was a great buy, it works really well and is fairly well built, my only complaint is that it burns through batteries like you wouldn't believe so keep plenty on hand."
1,terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrible,The thing jammed and started smoking in 10 minutes after like 2 seconds of it being on automatic. DO NOT BUY THIS. VERY VERY CRAPPY
2,Not worth $15,"This gun is great for your six year old to play with in the backyard, but you'll have to buy him another one after two weeks. If you want to do any kind of competition, NEVER BUY THIS GUN! It will break after a couple of days. The bbs will eventually just spill out of the guns tip. It is made of poor quality plastic and will eventually snap. It was my first Airsoft gun and I had no idea what an airsoft gun was supposed to work like, and even i knew is was crap. After it breaks you can do two things. Return it which is pointless, or give it to your dog to chew on.DO NOT BUY IT! IT IS A PIECE OF CRAP!!!"
2,TOY,"If you are looking for secondary weapon for actual game, do not choose this gun.If you are a beginner and want to buy your first weapon for actual game, do not choose this gun. Go buy shotgun or something.BUTIf you are looking for a gun you can play with and shoot at your dog or something, choose this gun. This gun is a perfect toy."
5,AWSOME,"This gun owns, I bought this from Sports Authority, the only difference it had was the back handle thing was different, on the box it said it holds 50 rounds. Just buy extra bbs for it, it is going to waste fast!!! I had it for a week and no jammed only once. If it gets jammed just pull the ammo holder front and back and you can fire again.Pros:Ownage gun50 round capacitySingle fire or automaticCons:No clips, but who cares it holds 50 rounds180fps barely hurts I shot myself on bare skin not even a welt.Sports Authority charged 25 bucks but I think it was better, it also was free shipping because I went to the shop lol.Pretty much it, it owns."
4,Not bad it's a good gun,"It's a nice gun.Just because the fps is like 150 its still good.It's so good that if you see any suckish review don't listen to it.Worth every penny!It's about 1 foot long(Without the stock open)but if you open the stock it's about 17 inches.If you are about to buy this,don't worry how you think that it's too small."
1,horrible gun!,When i first got this gun it broke! Its accuracy is bad. It only holds 30 rounds. DO NOT BUY THIS GUN!
1,never gonna come,well i ordered this and everything went good.well until they called me and said they were out of stock for at least 4-6 weeks.and in the status it said shipped but i guess it wasnt.and they still havent put out of stock on the page.so im trying to help u out of a month and a half wait.DONT BUY THIS!!!
3,good gun,this gun is pretty good it shoots very accurate and about20 feet before droping i got shot with this and it hurts at close range at medium range it still hurt a little
5,Master Padlock,This is a very rugged padlock. I will not worry that someone will cut it or damage it to the point where it unlocks. I am very satisfied with this padlock. It was shipped in a timely manner and arrived in good shape. Thanks.
2,Can only be used with full zoom,"The E550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed, you must have the camera's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens. So this means if the subject is moving around a lot, such as my daughter playing soccer, you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out. As long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful. I unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off, etc.Another negative is that the viewfinder doesn't show the zoomed in image, you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot, which can be difficult in bright sunlight."
2,Too expensive for a upgrade,I haven't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives. I have a Fujifilm E550 camera which cost is USD 250.00 by this date. This lens cost is USD 95.00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra USD 20.00. That means you will pay USD 365.00 for a 8x zoom camera. For that price or less you can get a +10x SLR like camera like the Fujifilm S5100 or S5200.
5,I love this Bible!,"I couldn't be more pleased with The Woman's Study Bible (Thomas Nelson, 1995). It arrived on time and in great condition. I currently have quite a collection of Bibles, but this one easily moved to the top of my list. In addition to reading the Bible, I love that it's chock full of interesting information to give a better understanding in our modern times, and it's truly geared toward women. This is such a beautiful Bible and I plan to purchase several more to give as gifts. If you're looking for a great woman's study Bible, this is it!"
3,average rating.,there are a number of good steps taught here except the texts that keep popping up which are distracting and time consuming.
4,Powerful is the word,"ok it's not easy make a review of a group like this and is more dfifficult if the group is a group with a great level of quality. Your head will be up and down and really don't care the opinion of someonelse. Great songs, great album and great GROUP. Really a classic."
2,Very detailed but jumps all over the place.,I liken this book to a book on how to work on cars. They start the book with an nice paced introduction and before you know it they start jumping all over the place....Ok here is where the oil goes and then if you want to overhual the transmission here is what you do and then here's how to change the windshield wipers and here's how to overhaul the engine. Advanced techincal areas are intermingled with simpler beginner techniques throughout the book. I was especially disappointed in the small areas of the book devoted to the use of text. Kind of interesting since a quote from the book is that text is a powerful way of graphic expression. Of the 554 pages they devote 30 to the use of text.I have been impressed with the SAMS books in the past but this one is a dud.
3,If you can get past the mistakes,There were so many mistakes (especially pages 20-22) that I have to double check everything I read from there on. And there are no corrections posted on the publisher's web page for the book so they either think the book's error free or they just don't care. I emailed them and asked if there was an errata page and got one of those replies you often receive from big companies that showed they didn't even really read my email in the first place.
3,Very Little Vampirism,"If it's fangs and lots of blood-drinking, this is not your film. Most of the vampirism is very understated... the vampire stalks a prey and turns back to camera to feed; that sort of thing. Be warned: the cover art is not taken from the film.Levres de Sang/Lips of Blood...A man recalls an experience as a boy at a castle when he meets a hauntingly beautiful woman. Somehow he's only reminded of this upon seeing a postcard of the castle. He then seeks to track it down, called on by visions of her. His mother tries to stop him, but he eventually is reunited with his pale ageless love.Rollin later re-edited this film, inserted lots of hardcore porn, and re-released the X version under the title of ""Suck me Vampire""."
4,the best yet,"of the jean rollins dvds i've seen this is the best , the picture quality is fine. I've got no problem with Jean Lou Philippe, I watched it in French and couldn't understand a word, but there is not much talking anyway. The streets of paris are bathed in a blue light and the castle shots are nice. The woman in white has a hella good body too."
4,The best of Bronson,"I go way back with Charles Bronson all of his movies were very straightforward, and the plot truly had substance."
2,Bootleg,"I received my copy of The Mechanic in no time. After ordering on Friday, I got my copy on Tuesday morning, Great! Only problem is, the copy I have is the most bootlegged piece of media you could get on Amazon. The case is very basic(it has actor name, and movie title). The DVD menu has one option-""play"". I can live with these disappointments, but at about the 1 hour mark the movie jumps ahead about 30 mins to the final 10 mins of the film. Its like someone took out a few scenes(Yacht) to fit it on a DVD. I am not happy with this purchase."
3,Husband loves this kind of movie,My husband loves these old movies. Especially when they have cool cars in them. He has seen this many times and never gets tired of it.
2,poor sound quaitly,thae movie is great but the dvd it self is poorsound keeps fading you have to keep playing with the volume contro; on you tv
2,"""",It was okay. i dont like old movies though. i just wanted to see it because i liked the new version. The action was good.
1,"I really like Charles Bronson, but save your money...","We purchased this movie thinking we would enjoy seeing Charles Bronson as we usually do. This movie, however, was a terrible disappointment to both me and my wife. We hated it so much we threw it in the trash."
1,Not a widescreen version,"The purported 1.85:1 widescreen side of this is not--it is merely the 4:3 framed film with the top and bottom sliced off to appear widescreen--the same thing MGM did with their double-sided DVD release of Coma. Watch the 4:3 side, because you are actually seeing much more of the original film with that version. Why, MGM, the phony widescreen appellation?"
4,ACTION PACKED,"STILL HOLDS UP, GREAT ACTION MOVIE. WONDERFUL ADDITION TO YOUR LIBRARY. CHARLES BRONSON WAS A MASTER AT LITTLE DIALOG AND A LOTS OF ACTION."
5,An interesting look into a part of Western Mass history,"Those who know something about the histories of Hampden and Hampshire Counties in Massachusetts are sure to be familiar with the Mill River disaster of 1874 and how it shaped the destinies of the towns it affected and those it didn't, as well as the people and families who survived that preventable tragedy. This book offers a quick but well-rounded glimpse into the private lives of one family who attained prominence both before and after the flood nearly ruined them. This collection of photographs makes an excellent companion volume to Elizabeth Sharpe's ""In the Shadow of the Dam"".On a more personal note, I would like to thank Ms. Thibodeau for providing me with what are probably the highest-quality pictures of my great-great-grandfather Thomas Skinner I will ever possess."
4,Best of the Year,"This is one of the best movies of its year. I don't know what year it was made so I can't say best of ex. 2000 though that may be the year. I heard ever since he was young, Nolan, the director wanted to make movies backwards. This movie was really good. It's probably the only movie that would ever work better backwards than forwards, and it has one of the ten most shocking endings in the last decade. Joe Pantoliano, (from the Sopranos) and Guy Pierce umm... (Memento) light up the screen, while Carrie Anne Moss (The Matrix) better than a girl, though one seen of her's is scary. In summation, probably the best cast for the movie. If you're watching the DVD, make sure you don't choose to watch it in forward motion. It will ruin the experrience."
1,Who? What? Where?,"I suppose the only reason I could suggest this film to anyone is if I have a sincere desire to torture someone else, or the person I'm referring it to is just as confused as this movie is. The movie from beginning to end is exactly that, confusing. The constant ""rewind technique"" the film seems to use is part of the love/hate issue I experienced. I think it's very trendy technique though. It's just they use it way to often. You get 5 minutes ahead only to go back 10. It's very frustrating for me to watch. The only reason I finished the film was that I wanted to see if all this rewinding/fast forwarding was going to pay off. Somehow it never did."
2,Big Disappointment,"Nice gimmick, but lousy story. The director is in love with the way he's telling this mediocre story and that sustains the movie for the first thirty minutes, but then tedium sets in. I'm glad he tried so hard to do something different, and that may make the movie worth seeing (ok, it's worth seeing briefly for being unique, but you'll get bored with it pretty quickly so have another movie handy to put in when this one starts putting you to sleep). There is mild fun in trying to piece all the elements together, but once you do there isn't anything interesting going on. People are giving this movie too much credit for telling its story from both the beginning and the end at the same time with an actual ending somewhere in the middle, and aren't giving it enough criticism for being just a simple minded and uninteresting story to begin with."
4,otnemem.......,"This movie is amazing but lets give credit where credit is due. This movie is a rip off (albiet an amazing one) of the classic ""backwards"" Sienfield episode which came before it.Guy Pierce rocks,,,,,and Carrie Ann Moss shows she can be more than a Karate Kid in leather. I do think this movie has been overembraced by the public because it is so trendy to like anything different, Originality should be appreciated for what it is, not because it is hip to appreciate it,"
3,"Amusing, Clever, Rather Slight","Memento is an amusing way to spend ninety odd minutes, no more. The gimmick is neatly handled, but ultimately turns out to be rather more obvious than I had anticipated. This whole business of basing an entire film on one slim premise is getting rather tiresome. First The Usual Suspects, then The Sixth Sense, then this.If any of the characters had grown on me as human beings, I might have liked the film better. As it is, it is a rather chilly exercise in style and narrative trickery. Nothing more."
5,Best Movie Ever,This is one of the best and orginal movies ever. The only movie that goes backwards. It is an awsome thriller if you want a movie that you will not guess the ending rather beginng.It is a must see for all thiller fans.
3,Worth Watching at Least Twice,"While this movie is not a classic, it certainly was worth watching twice. The first time is very interesting, and the second time allows the viewer to make their own interpretation about what is REALLY happening."
3,"Who wants to take a psychiatric evaluation on their TV screen, Not Me.","The movie rocks. It's thought provoking, ground-breaking and unconventional. I give it 5 stars.It's too bad that they took this same approach to the grossly misguided DVD menu design. The menus play out like a psychiatric evaluation with multiple choice answers that have nothing to do with anything, especially when all you want to do is get to the movie and supplementary material. Who wants to go through a frustrating process seemingly on an unending loop just to get to the movie and unlocking other DVD features? I was not amused. I hated this DVD treatment."
3,I wanted the complicated menu,I bought this copy because after reading reviews I thought it would have the complicated dvd menu like the regular dvd has. I was severely disappointed to see it didn't have that but instead a simple one.
5,"This takes some work to watch, but it's worth it. . . .","I kept wanting to hit pause and think about this one, as the backwards story-telling can get to be a bit much at times. It certainly was worth it, though, to get to the end (actually, the beginning) and see what the filmmakers had accomplished. The acting is very good here, and the characters are all believable and fascinating. The most fascinating thing about it is that they've created a film that mirrors the main character's method of keeping track of things--they've made a series of snapshots that continue to answer questions about something we know but don't have any memory of. And without ruining the ending, they've made us doubt or question virtually everything we've seen up until the final frame. We'll never know who Leonard truly is or what he's truly done, but this film is a great ride to get to the end (beginning) of the road."
5,This is one of those few movies...,"...That leave you thinking about yourself long after you've seen it. I was able to follow three complete stories and implications, but I'm sure there are many more. The DVD version is great: it has the original story and a very good multimedia interpretation of the movie, the designers are on to something here. Highly recommendable!"
5,GREAT,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made! After seeing it in theaters I knew I would have to buy it on DVD. Great sound and visuals on the DVD and pretty nice special features. I really enjoyed the ""newspaper article"" that helped explain a few confusing parts. I highly recommend this movie."
1,Is this a joke ?,"Worst movie ever. It tries to be different, but it's nothing. Bad acting, bad plot, really a joke."
1,This is a waste of time.,"I liked Guy Pirece from ""LA. Confidential"", and I was really looking forward to this film. While the concept could have good, it completely breaks down. This is one of the worst movies, in that you keep hoping it will be explained, or get better..... IT DOES NOT !"
1,Very bad movie! Don't waste your money!,"I don't know where to begin. . .I hate the actors, especially the main character. I have never seen a character so stupid until now. He's also very annoying.Who gives a s**t that he's have short term memory loss??"
1,Horrible if you're a moron or some kind of freakin' genius!,Totally unrealistic and stupid. The tattoo concept was so dumb!
2,I got lost in the middle of this film and started hating it!!!,"I really thought I would like this movie. Everyone I spoke with, said it was like the movie ""The Machinist"". It was not! Only the notes and the guy being lost was something like it. Also, I really can't stand Guy Pearce. He is pretentious and arrogant. I could not stand to watch any more of this film. It should have been filmed mostly at night. With some good haunting music for the film score. Just way too bad I paid $18.50 for this mind puzzling crap. Tortuous and it really hurt my brain to try to follow this film. This best part about this film was that it was low budget. I did like that. [...]"
1,Not worth sitting through,"The concept of this movie is a good one, but it fails to keep you entertained.It is annoying and boring. Not to mention this is not one of Guy Pearce's best work."
1,"This film is horrible. Please, don't waist your time.","I don't have to say much about this movie to let you know don't waist you time or money. I paid $21 for it through Columiba house. I relied upon the good comments of others before I bought it. It was boring, sensless, and a downright waist of time. If you must put yourself through such torture at least go rent it. The only movie that comes close to such idiocy is The Man Who Fell to Earth."
1,What in the #@%!,I believe that the individuals that gave this movie a high rating only wants us to think that they knew what (...) was going on. No one is THAT intellegent. I think that movie started from the end and continued in reverse was because the writer and directer didn't have an ending for this puzzle. It was just a distration from the typical movie about a wife who really committed suicide and the husband went nuts...
4,Christopher Nolan,"The name Christopher Nolan says it all. If you enjoy a thought provoking film, Christopher Nolan is the way to go. And this film doesn't disappoint."
4,"A sign of ""things to come""","A great director, an unusual story line and a very talented Australian actor made this a great movie. Their recent efforts show how good they are."
2,Somewhat Satisfied,"This is a great movie, although I am only giving it two stars because this particular DVD had captioning. When I placed the order it did not say there would be captioning the whole entire movie. I got used to it as the movie went on, but it was still very annoying. I checked the settings on the dvd player and it wasn't the player. Please note I bought this as a used DVD and it was so cheap I didn't bother complaining or returning it. I guess if I watch it again I'll have to get used to the captioning again."
2,Too Much Work for Too Slim a Return,"I didn't hate it, but beyond the way the story's told there's really very little there. Seeing the movie told from the hero's point of view is interesting... for the first few minutes."
1,Limited edition,"This is probably one of the best movies in my collection but the limited edition version is simply awful. In a nutshell the special features are a mess. It's almost like being harassed by your DVD.The DVD starts out by asking you a ton of stupid questions which, for those seeing the movie for the first time, would help to give away some of the movies mystery.The original DVD version is much much better. It has the movie and the short story that the movie was based on. THAT IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED but I guess Christopher Nolan wanted to milk the fans for a few more bucks.A nice special feature for this DVD would have been to have the option to play the movie in sequential order. While this would be a horrible way to first watch the film, I'm sure many fans wouldn't mind watching it that way."
3,PAY ATTENTION TO THIS ONE....,"I liked this movie alot, but I found that if I even turned my head away for a split second that I would miss something. It's the kind of movie that you really need to pay attention to at all times.It was a very interesting idea that was well crafted. I think that Guy Pearce was amazing in this movie. It has a few twists and turns that are well worth watcing. The idea of telling everything in reverse was different, and there were only a few times that I truly felt confused. (I think my husband asking me a thousand ??'s during the movie didn't help), I just may watch it again to see if I missed anything.It's a original film, and one of the better films I've seen this year. Worth a rental fee, just be in the mood it."
4,Spellbinding!!!,"This is one of the most twisted, yet edge of your seat movies I've ever seen. Chistopher Nolan is now one of my favorite directors of all time after watching this SPELLBINDING flick! It truely is a masterpiece for our generation of TWIST AND TURN movies."
3,Better than Nothing,"""Memento"" provides a cleverly executed gimmick, well above current Hollywood standards, but is that enough?"
2,Note to self....,"Recipe for success in filmaking in the 00's. Write a dyslexic 20 minute short story about a tattoed idiot in a motel room. Shuffle pages, go to Kinkos, make 300 copies, shuffle again, call Tarantino. Rake in the dough.I give this film credit for trying to be different, but the only thing it succeeds in doing is being a monotonous bore. The votes for this dog are proof positive of the near complete dumbing down of this country...either that or just another example of the ""Bandwagon"" Syndrome."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!!!,"""Stunning"", ""intelligent"".. Há! This is some of the worst movie ever made. No', I'm not dumb, I understand the plot completely. But what's the point in shooting this history this way? By the way, there is no history at all. By the end of the movie, I no longer cared about Guy Pearce's character search for his ""JOHN G."" THis movies is a swindle, like ""THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT""."
1,what a mess,"Where am I? And why am I watching this movie? What happened in this scene? And what happened in that scene? If not being able to follow what happens to the narrator qualifies as unique moviemaking, then it is one of a kind. But that doesn't mean its great. I walked out in the middle. And I never looked back."
5,put the sequence back in order,"The marketers would be real smart if there's an option in the DVD which rearranges the movie's sequences in a chronological order. This way, people in real life who suffer from short term memory loss will stop asking stupid questions."
2,"Yeah, right.","I only watched half of it. I tried, but this is a boring excercise in trying to figure out what's going on in a story that starts at the end and brings you back to ""what happened"" by taking back to the beginning scene by scene in reverse order. If those scenes had been intereting in themselves maybe I'd have stuck it out, but for the hour that I sat through, this movie was a big yawner."
1,Memento,We have been sent a DVD that is for Region 1.... therefore we cannot play it in Australia. Amazon should be aware of this and make sure that the correct DVDs are sent to the relevant regions.
1,Memento,"I have tried to watch this movie 2 or 3 times and can't get past the forst thirty minutes, makes no sense to me or my wife and friends, I guess I will try to watch it again."
1,I wish I could forget this movie...,"HEre we go. THings are funny sometimes. Only because a director chose to tell the history BACKWARDS, people say it's a masterpiece!! Go figure why!!This is a silly movie, witha lot of bad taste, with an evils kin around it. Pearce's character is obnoxious, as almost most characters he plays. THere's absolutely no dificult to follow the backwards plot, it's just annoying. Blergh!"
1,You Have Got to be Kidding Me?..,"Are all of you people brain dead, or what?.. This had to be the dumbest movie I've seen in quite a while..My favorite ""laugh out loud"" moment?.. When Guy Pierce comes into the hotel lobby and a car drives by, blaring it's horn, which makes Pierce jolt to look at the car, and of course he loses his memory.. Then he turns to the clerk and says..""I don't know if I told you this, but I have a bit of a memory problem""..How, exactly, Mr Pierce, can you remember you have a memory problem, when you have said memory problem?..LOL.. I'm sorry, but I don't have an IQ that hovers around 95.."
5,I'll Never Forget Sammy Jankis,"This movie absolutely blew my mind. After i saw it for the first time, I could not stop thinking about it. It is fast-paced and uniquely filmed and the performances are great. Anyone interested in mind-bending films that involve the use of the brain and contain complex plot structures should definately see this film. Anyone who [isn't] and can only be entertained by movies where someone is whipping out pistols and shooting people off of rooftops should not."
5,Memento,"Ingenious thriller dares to be intelligent and different, and gets away with it. Since the audience sees most everything from Leonard's disoriented perspective, the movie requires more careful attention than your average thriller. Happily, ""Memento"" is suspenseful enough to command it. Pearce makes an ideal Leonard, a desperate man skirting insanity, but Pantoliano steals the show as the shady, enigmatic Teddy."
1,Find another movie to view,"I positively hated this movie. I do not know how Hollywood puts money behind such awful stuff. I understand the premise, but I hated nonetheless. Utterly incomprehensible with characters you could care less about. If you buy or rent this movie, prepare yourself for a downer."
1,Bad!,There was nothing about memento that I likes. Well the acting by Pearce was very good but the plot was not that good. All I see is a psychotic guy who can't remember anything. He writed on himself...weird
1,TEDIUM AD NAUSEAM,"Way overrated and not worth the time. Joe Pantoliano is usually good (even when the film isn't) only this time it's not his fault at all--because there isn't much for him to do.The gimmick (short term memory loss) would have worked had the film been no more than thirty minutes) alas, this thing drags on and on.How often can you sit through the same scene over and over and over and over...By the time this flick ended I didn't care who did what to whom."
1,Momento - Dee not so fresh maker,"Deed chu eber watch a moovee and ask chu self, ""What dee heck deed I juss watch?"". Chu weel if chu watch Momento. I dun know what dee begeening, I dun know what dee end, I dun eben know what in between. It juss about a crazee hoto who dun know chit. I say it crazee movie, I no like."
1,Suck Job City !!!!!,"Everybody I know, who has seen this movie, loved it. I absolutely hated it. I thought it totally sucked. It was difficult to follow, but that's not why I dislike it so much. I found it to be really stupid. The story line is lame, the characters are under-developed, and it is very unrealistic. I mean, jeeze, does anyone really believe that you can give yourself a tattoo with a syringe and some ink from a bic pen that is perfectly legible and looks professionally done? Also, when one gets a tattoo, doesn't it take longer than a few hours for the skin to heal and return to normal? WEAK !! None of the characters in this movie are worth caring about at all.Don't waste your time or your money on this one."
2,Cheap cinematic tricks.,"The only reason this movie keeps you guessing is through the use of deceptive editing. Had the director used a straight-forward timeline, the ""mystery"" would be immediately evident.. I personally don't like contrived confusion. If the screenplay isn't clever enough to engage the movie-goer then throw in a few ""cuts,"" jump the time-line around, and ""voila"" instant confusion. Much the same effect as Quentin Tarantino uses. When the movie ended, I felt cheated because the mystery is so profoundly mudane. Give me Hitchcock any day."
3,Buy the standard edition,The special edition looks cool but is hard to get out of the case and also the menu while looks cool and is hard to navigate if you just what to watch the movie. Buy the regular edition and save your money. As far as the movie its one of the best movies of the decade and started off the beginning of Christopher Nolan tear of great movies.
2,Rethink this one,"Although it's based on an interesting concept--that of short-term memory loss--I have difficulty understanding why anyone likes this film. It's very violent, plus the nature of the story requires the same scenes to be played over and over. Enough already! We got the point! The same point could be made in a much more interesting fashion. The production was fine, but overall I found this film to be a real downer."
2,Clean Slate II,"Remember the Dana Carvey comedy ""Clean Slate""? if not you probably won't mind that Momento is the non-comedy version of this Dana Carvey dud. The plot is fine, the acting is fine, the backwards story isn't as good as the backward episode of Seinfeld, but still fun. Basically this movie got some good hype early on, and has been too ARTSY for anyone to disagree. Not a waste of money, but not nearly as fresh or clever or new as it would like to be. A solid movie borrowing heavily from other sources. If one is not familiar with these other works, I am sure Momento is compelling, on the other hand, anyone who watches TV or film regularly will be dissapointed."
3,.....,"I just finished watching ""Memento"", and it is definetly one of the most mindbending movies I have ever sceen. Just let me put it this way. The movies gose backwards. ""Memento"" seriously moves backwards. It tells the story of a man whos wife was raped and muder by the same guy who knocked him on the head and gave a disorder were he can't use his short term memorie at all. so has to find and kill the man who killed his wife using notes he takes on every little thing he dose. As well as trusting people who aren't very trust worthery. Like the guy who might have done the killing and is just trying to mess around with his poor mind.The movie starts off with the man killing the killer who killed his wife, and then it gose backwards from there. It is pretty easy for me to see were some people would hate the very original ""Memento"". Just getting up to go the restroom while watching ""Memento"" is not a good idea. You might get lost."
4,(Mostly) 25 Word Or Less Review,"Too clever for own good. Like ""The Usual Suspects"", ending colors entire film on subsequent viewings. So much emphasis on mystery that resolution hurts experience.DVD side-note: Extremely cool formating of extras."
2,"Interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying.","The idea of a movie running backwards is intriguing, and this one is well-edited. The different styles made the film a puzzle to figure out as it runs. The whole premise of having no short-term memory is fascinating. Memento has the dark, edginess of Fight Club. It is a very dark film. So if you like movies for the concept, and don't care about a happy ending or uplifting message, then you'll probably like this."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","This movie had the advantage with the good story, but was ruined with the bad directing, or acting, and the lack of excitement. It was just too boring, nothing was going on, the story didn't make any progress. The lack of enthusiam in the acting was also a problem. Could have been good, but too boring."
3,I don't get it.,"I understand the story. There were so many evil people in this movie and everyone looks terrible. I am a big fan of Guy Pierce and his first movie, Priscilla Queen of the Desert is still my favorite performance of his so I was very happy that he was finally recognized with Memento (although it seems to have been his version of kd lang's Constant Craving where the public recognized at long last your talent and then ignores you.)My reaction to this movie was ""So what?"""
2,Boring and Gimmicky,"Intresting premise that loses its' luster halfway through the film. What we're left with is boring acting, and some predictable twists. Decent directing keeps it from one star, but just barely. This is just more overrated junk like The Shining and The Matrix. Avoid if you know what's good for you."
3,"Great Movie,Baffling DVD","Ok,first of all,Memento is a very intriguing movie,with a first rate cast,led by Guy Pierce.It's a movie that really keeps you guessing.However,I am very dissapointed with this 2 DVD set.When I pop in a DVD I'm not interested in how ""clever"" the menus can be.I want to get right down to business.So I was very perplexed when I popped in the 2 discs only to find out they are set up like a psychiatric evaluation,and you have to answer all kinds of crazy questions to get to the features,and you don't even know where they will lead you!I guess I'm just not patient enough for such nonsense.When I want to watch a movie,that's what I want!Not a bunch of ""clever"" menus."
5,Sheer Genius!,It is rare to see a film which can truly be called unique. This is one of the few. The entire movie is backwards. No the people don't walk and talk in reverse...darn it you just have to see it to understand. Just when you think it's a great movie it gets better.
4,Brilliant or too clever?,I'd have to say it might have been too complex and clever except for all the brilliant acting. I got so obsessed I watched it three times and took notes to remind myself of all the details and clues. I might have been wasting my time except that the acting and story are all so deep and nuanced I enjoyed every time. Was the wife a drug-dealer? What was she reading over and over again - I think there are still some things to discover....
5,"FINALLY, a Chronological Option!","...I pre-ordered the Limited Edition...Disc 2 allows a chronological option. As you click through the menus, you'll be told to put a sequence of a woman changing her tire in order. Put it in reverse order, and you will be treated to Memento played forward sequentially, starting with the credits rolling backwards and ending on the photo of Teddy's shooting.You heard it here folks. I don't care if you have the original release, buy this one before the first edition with the cool packaging gets snatched up."
5,If I could give more than 5 stars I would.,"This is probably one of the greatest films in the past ten years, and definatly most original. If you enjoy mystery, crime, or psychological thrillers, this is for you. Now if the film itself wasn't good enough this special edition DVD looks amazing, I plan on buying it the day it comes out."
4,Spooky and haunting,"Ever wondered what life would be like if you had no short term memory? Then check out this haunting movie..I will be honest the plot is not the best at times but, the movie sucks you up into it.Like some of the more alternate genre movies this one starts at the end of the movie and leads you back to the beginning in steps.. It helps you to distinguish between past and now using black and white photo and color photo both..Sit back and enjoy this one folks.."
3,Good purchase bad features,"Memento is a very good movie. The blu-ray format presents the movie in a clean format but the extras and almost no subtitles makes it hard to share with everyone you want.Taking in consideration that the plot is hard to follow. I think a better release is to be made. Although, is not a bad choice if you want to have it in the best digital format."
3,Confused,"I want to start by saying I love this movie. If I were reviewing the movie I would have awarded five stars without question.My problem is with this limited edition dvd. The menu system is a puzzle ten times as complicated as the movie's plot. After ten minutes of frustration I enable the director's commentary, what followed was a low volumed monotone Chris Nolan who put me to sleep. I think the world of this director and it would have been nice if he could have exhibited at least a portion of the excitement I felt after having unlocked the puzzle to hear him.As for the second dvd I cannot say much about it, I haven't been able to unlock a single feature. I was able to diagnose myself as a paranoid schizophrenic."
3,WARNING :LETTERBOXED VERSION,"i love this movie! it's ok, but i am so disapointed the new limited version is NOT a widescreen version! despite all previews said it is an anamorphic version, IT IS NOT!i bought the limited version and i am not happy! SO I WANT TO TAKE CARE ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO SELL THEIR OLDER VERSION TO BUY THIS ONE : IT IS A BAD IDEA(to watch the film in high condition)!bonuses are amazing and very interesting and the packaging is the best i ever seen after FIGHT CLUB and SE7EN! but the aspect ratio is still very important because the film itself is the most important thing in a DVD!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent film,"My teenaged son wanted me to order this film after seeing Inception. He, his friends, and everyone who has seen it liked it much better."
4,Good Film!,"I think I'm the only person out of my entire sphere of friends and family that actually liked this movie. I mean I really liked it, I think its great. Pierce does a great acting job, and the film doesn't insult your intelligence, it makes you work to follow key plot points. People actually have to pay attention to what is going on, which is something that is highly unusual in ""mainstream"" American cinema. So if you are a fan of somewhat more difficult films you should check this one out."
3,Great movie - bad BD,"I purchased 2 years ago, about the same time I bought my PS3. Movie is great so I decided to watch again recently and no movie doesn't run. No scratches, same PS3, 2nd time taken out of box. Perhaps this is a Lionsgate issue cause same thing happened with American Psycho."
5,simplemente maravillosa,"creo que es una excelente pelicula..sipudiera darle mas estrellas .. lo haria.---- un guion maravilloso... una pelicula..que te mantiene en suspenso desde el principio al final... y que..comienza precisamente con el final...debo decir que es uno de los mejores trabajos del director Nolan, que si bien no tiene un elenco tan conocido en Holliywood, esto no impidio que dieran unas excelentes interpretaciones... una pelicula..que es muy altamente recomendable ..por su calidad.. y por su tematica tan original...muchas felicitaciones..a los realizadores de la mismasaludos.."
3,"Good yes, Great no","Memnto is impressive but in the end it dosen't leave much of an impression. Like a day in Leonard's life, it slips easily from memory, favoring sensation over insight and frisson of artificial confusion over any contemplation of human reality. Leonard's tatoos and photographs are a poor and unreliable substitute for the thick confusion of memory and Memento for all it's undeniable formal dazzle, is a triumph of mind in the absence of matter."
2,"fast take-off, slow landing","The movie was enjoyable, good performance by pierce. You all forget the biggest hole. HOW DOES HE REMEMBER HIS CONDITION!? Good premise is ruined by bad script!"
2,One of those films,"This movie is enjoyable up till the ending. The ending is horrible, though! It destroys the character's believability. There are other movies like this: _Primal Fear_ comes to mind. The filmmaker just can't resist sticking in his gimmicky little ""surprise twist"" ending, even if it ruins the film. Lots of people disagree with my opinion on this, and I don't know what to say to them: if Guy Pierce's character doesn't strike you as a totally unacceptable portrait of a human being, you don't really know our species that well.But up until that phony ending, it's a real nice movie. The backwards narration forces you to give your full attention, and the result is that you become deeply involved in what's going on. It's quite an experience, and I guess ultimately I recommend this movie for that reason."
3,Frustrating,"Telling the story backwards is a clever device, but the payoff once you get to the ""ending"" just isn't there. When you find out what this movie is all about, you will feel somewhat disappointed. If it was told forward in a normal forward fashion, it would be just another shlocky Sunday afternoon TV flick.An intriguing and worthwhile movie, but it doesn't deserve the hype."
2,Movie,"When I opened this movie, it had been damaged in two spots. Since it's a Christmas present, I'm not very happy with it."
1,A Wildly Overrated Film!!,"I cannot believe how many people loved this film. It is grossly overrated. Discussions around this film center on its ""groundbreaking"" backwards structure. Well, there is a little known film from the early 1980's called ""Betrayal"" starring Jeremy Irons and Ben Kingsley. It is a film about a love triangle that is told backwards. TV's Seinfeld did a riff on Betrayal with the Indian Wedding episode. So this film is hardly groundbreaking. As for the story, I found it boring. Yet another revenge story, HO HUM. This film is just yet another variation on the Pulp Fiction influence."
1,Boring,"This movie makes no sense. So what if i didn't understand it, it would still be boring. I can't understand why anyone would like this movie."
5,May Replace Citizen Kane As Number One Movie Of All Time!...,"This could well be the greatest movie of all time. It is without peer. A true cinematic gem, missed at the yawn awards. Inventive, stylish, provocative and in a class all by it's self. This is virtuosso film making at it's finest! A true movie connoisseur's movie..."
5,Whoa!,"Finally, a movie I couldn't figure out halfway through!If you are looking for something completely different, a film interesting on many, many levels, try this one. Guy Pearce is entrancing as the memory-impaired Leonard, and Carrie-Anne Moss is sultrier than ever. And just wait til the ending! (Or is it the beginning...)"
4,Great Easter Egg!,"This review is for the Two-Disc Limited Edition of Memento.I really enjoy this movie, which I feel is just as fresh and exciting now as it was when it was first released. But the thing that REALLY impresses me about this movie is that if you watch the scenes in order, the movie still works as a thriller, and a mystery. The original version, with the scenes played backward, is a gimmick, but but it's not JUST a gimmick. I highly reccomend buying the Limited Edition DVD, which has an easter egg which allows you to reverse the scenes.The one annoying thing about the limited edition is that the menu is not set up as a normal menu. You'll have to either play around and explore the different menu screens, or just google for directions."
5,Awesome product for Christopher Nolan lovers!,"This Collector's DVD is an awesome piece to add to your Christopher Nolan collection. The bonus DVD has the chronological edition, though you have to go through a series of questions to access this portion of the DVD (do a google search for the answers if you lose your patience!)"
5,stunning,"forget all the box office blockbusters that u sit through and come out of feeling empty. this movie is what cinema should be about. it will have you guessing, wondering, THINKING. what a concept, a film actually getting you to use your brain. this is not insipid entertainment. this is gripping and puzzling. u will find yourself talking out loud to your friends attempting to figure out the next step in the movie will be while puzzled about the previous step in the movie and figuring how it all connects. but dont talk too loud or for too long, youll miss something else! dont get up to go to the bathroom, dont get up for a snack, or be sure to pause the movie when u do. if u miss even a bit of the movie, youll be out of it to say the least! anyways, this movie is amazing and awesome and what film should aspire to be! 5 stars!"
5,Gave me a headache,"This is one of the most confusing and twisted movies that I have ever seen. I hated it at first, but once I was through watching it and started thinking about everything that I had just seen (and took some aspirin for the headache it gave me) I started to understand and enjoy it. I have now watched it several times and each time I see it I discover something new that I had not seen or noticed before. It is truly an awesome movie that will keep you guessing long after you have turned it off. Plus, all of the acting in it is fantastic. Plan on spending an entire night watching and rewatching this one. Enjoy!!!! (get that bottle of aspirin out!!!!)"
4,Will keep you guessing to the end...(or beginning?),"Being a mystery fan, I enjoyed this storyline as it kept me guessing who was a friend & who was the foe until the very end.It is a very fast paced movie that runs from end to beginning...makes you think you would have all the answers right? Not so!The only problem with this movie is that so much depends on the ending (or rather the beginning) that once you know the whole story, that is it. All done. Over. Fin.As much as I liked it, I don't think watching it again would have the same effect. I highly recommend it as a great rental, but I have to say I don't think it is something I would purchase."
5,Once Than More This Watch To Need You'll.,Masterpiece a. Year this seen I've movie best the arguably.
5,The best suspense movie ever,"What can I say about Memento??? Well, it's AMAZING!!! This movie is so fresh and sylish. Do yourself a favor GO BUY THIS DVD. You won't regret it. Guy Pearce's performanc is wonderful. Joe Pantoliano is also. And the way the movie pieces itself together is so cool."
5,Engrossing and Thought Provoking To Say The Least,"Wow, what a movie...I've had a few in the past that made me go directly to the internet to see what other people thought about the ending and specific plot elements. This movie, right from the start, sucks you in and does not let you go until the ending credits roll by. I was mad at first, some movies you really want to understand and this one lets a lot of the ending come from each person that watches it. You can formulate your own stance on the ending from the various events presented in the plot. A must see, and a great DVD!"
4,One major flaw!,I thought this was an excellent film. The script was absolutely original and really kept you guessing until the very end. I give it four stars but I found one problem that really blows the whole concept. If he can't remember anything that happened after the attack how does he know anything about his illness. He seems to wake up fine and know that he has this problem of no short-term memory. It doesn't seem like he should be able to remember that. I may be being a little picky but it does seem crucial the plot.
2,Can You Help Me?,"I like the people in this movie and mostly the pretty girl with the dark hairs. I don't quiet understanding why the man has tatoos, however. Sometimes he rubs them, and sometimes they are in big letters, like, DON'T ANSWER PHONES!!!! Does he have a tattoo-making friend who owes money to the phone company? I couldn't tell. Also, why does the bald man come so much to the hotel rooms? Does he work for the phone companies maybe? Also the girl was pretty but was in dark places many times - does she have the light burning problem? Maybe she is a witch and explodes in the daytimes!! Can someone please explain? I like the man in the room but he should try markings other than words; he is not a piece of paper!! Maybe that's why he keeps going to same places again!! My questions make two stars for the nice people, but answers give three more tomorrow!!!"
2,Way too confusing...,The director went out of his way to make what could have been a decent movie into a confusing disjointed mess.
1,From Bad to Worse,"Si tuviera una escala negativa le daria -10, porque es lo mas aburrido y tonto que he visto, con decirles que ni la pude terminar porque realmente es tremendamente terrible. I stunned at so many good reviews. No gasten su tiempo ni dinero."
1,PIECE OF GARBAGE,"Only people thinking they are ""erudits"", ntelligent""people, who does not like Hollywood old cliches, will say they loved this piece of junk. THis movie is so indulgent, so cruel, sos tasteless, that in the middle of it you simply don't care about the fate of that mess of a character interpreted by Guy Pearce. I idsliked this movie from beggining to end. No, I had absolutely none difficult to follow the falshbacks all the time, that's not the point. The point is that the history is awful, bad tasted, ridiculous, a disgrace to motion picture. But director and cast can rest assured they made something ""unique"" in thtehistory of the movies: one of the worst wastes of time ever !"
5,You'll watch it over and over,"Heck, you'll have to. This movie makes you twist your mind and think around corners. After the first viewing I was wondering if the 'mystery' was ever solved! I see this as one of those great 'little' movies that are simply wonderful, like ""Slingblade."""
3,I wanted to love this movie - but...,"I heard such great things about this film, but I tried to watch it with little expectations. I really like Guy Pierce and Carrie Anne-Moss, and the style and concept were interesting - however, It just took too long to get there -and I didn't think that figuring out the ending was all that difficult or surprising. Rent, not buy."
4,Not for the simple minded,"This movie is one that you must pay attention to. It contains constant flash backs or flash forwards for that matter. The main character (Guy) used to be an insurance investigator, till a tragedy happend in his life. This turned his life around. He suffers from short term memory loss. This is the reason for his many 'notes'. The ending really makes you think twice. The whole movie makes you think twice. It is something that you will need to watch more then once but it is definately worth your time."
4,I like the way it moves.,"Excellent movie as long as you don't turn away from the screen. If you do, you will have no idea what has happened or is getting ready to happen. I happen to enjoy the way that each of the film's scenes tells a story unto itself. The ending was perfect. It kind of socked you right between the eyes and I love that kind of non-predictable, edgy side to this film. It was definitely not your average ho-hum drama. It was intense from start to finish. I highly recommend this film for anyone who is into edgy, dark drama."
4,Saw it Again,"I had last seen this movie when it first came out and decided to see it again after having watched Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. The storytelling is still just as interesting the second time around. Like Mr. Nolan's movie ""Inception,"" it provokes the viewer to review the storyline and whether things turned out as the movie had unfolded. Great movie."
5,An astonishing film,"I saw the DVD 3 times over the course of 2 days and each time I saw it, the richness and sheer genius of execution becomes more and more apparent. This is probably one of the most tightly crafted films I've seen in years. The performances, especially from Pearce are nothing short of astonishing. This is ensemble acting at its absolute best with completely flawless direction and razor-sharp script. This is a desert-island film to keep and view periodically."
5,Incredible Movie,"This was the most incredibly well made movies i've seen in a long time. This movie has more twists than any other i've ever seen. The backwards story is great. Sure it may not be the most believable movie, like the weird memory problem he has, but who cares. This is a fantastic movie that will keep you guessing to the very end and anybody who didn't like this movie is just too stupid to understand it."
5,Loved it!!!,"I'm not going to get into the storyline, but I will ask...why are so many reviewers confused by the ending of this movie? What exactly don't you get?I was pleasantly surprised by the bizarre nature of the film. It was a little distracting at first, but my husband and I enjoyed putting the pieces of the puzzle together. And I felt that the ending was pretty self-explanatory.I really enjoyed this movie...while it might not be the most original film ever made, it certainly was an interesting one."
4,"Great Film, Could have been a better DVD","This is a great movie that requires multiple viewings, but the thing that bugs me a little about this DVD is that its a bit thin on the extras. Its got trailers and an interview with Christopher Nolan, but that's about it.What would have been great would be the ability to watch the film in the correct order. Sure it wouldn't have been as interesting, but would help clear more then a few things up."
2,All I can remember is my recurring condition...,"This movie might interest you if you can look past the fact that it is both inherently flawed in plot and boring as hell. Apparently our hero can't remember anything, yet he's clairvoyant when it comes to diagnosing his own constantly recurring amnesia. Just brilliant enough to interest scores of stoned undergraduates."
4,Memento,"all i can say is great price, the movie got to us super quick, cant complain at all! enjoyable exchange."
4,Great DVD menú,El menú del DVD es muy interesante porque te hace ver todo un tipo de expediente clñínico y los botones de cada sección están parcialmente ocultos.me gustó mucho
3,interesting...,"this movie was certainly different than most i have seen. i really liked the end, but with all of the different time-changes it got to be a bit confusing. i'd say its about 3 1/2 stars. it definitely makes you think and pay attention, though it's easy to get lost with everything going on."
5,The most original movie in a decade or more,"I was lucky enough to get to see this in the theater and it rocked. You leave with what I refer to as the ""12 Monkeys"" feeling: you almost know what went on, but not quite. If you buy a copy and get to watch it again, you feel like you know the deal, but it never stops being intriguing.Trust me, there's a reason why it slid into the IMDB.com top 10 of all time even though it was never released to a lot of theaters.Carrie-Anne Moss may have already staked her claim in the biz with the Matrix movies, but you can now expect to see huge things from Guy Pearce and Christopher Nolan as well."
2,What a mess!,"ohmigod....I love this movie, but thank God I didn't buy the Limited Edition version of the DVD. A friend of mine wasn't so lucky.I've seen it up close and I can't imagine what they were thinking. You have to play an unending stream of nightmarish games to use the DVD!The disc with the movie is easy enough to figure if you work it out logically. You'll be shown a quickly edited series of words. Then the DVD will ask you which word wasn't shown to you in the sequence. To start the movie, pick the word ""Watch"" out of the menu. Movie will play.But put in the Special Features DVD and it's just dumb luck if you find ANYTHING. In fact, by the time you see something, you'll be so annoyed you can't enjoy it.I know they were trying to simulate psychological tests or perhaps the experience of having no memory. But they went too far. It's infuriating, it's monotonous and it's not worth [the money] for the aggravation. Rent it - Don't buy it!"
1,absolute junk,i gave this one plenty of chance but it proved to be a total violent psychotic junk. why do they make such bad movies. waste of money.
4,Nolan's work,"I gave Memento four stars because it is by Christopher Nolan, but this is by far my least favorite of his movies. Did nothing for me."
4,Can't go wrong for $5,"Great movie, excellent acting and a brilliant script. One of his best performances. Having this as part of the collection was a no brainer!"
3,Over Rated,This movie is ok but its a chore to watch because of all the memory loss and reliving it. Half way through you get bored with the concept and just want a follow able plot.
1,buyer beware of the two disc limited edition,"I think Memento is a fine, interesting film. But if you just want to see the movie itself, DO NOT BUY THE 2-DISC VERSION. you literally have to participate in these series of psych-type tests in order to get at anything you actually want to see, and there's NO WAY AROUND the tests. you can never watch without going through them. you're paying for the tests, not just the film. i'm not exaggerating. i bought one, tried for maybe ten minutes, and now i'm putting it back on sale on amazon.tj"
1,"Excellent film, pain-in-the-derriere DVD","I'd like to begin by saying this is one movie that should not be missed. The film itself is a milestone in the annals of innovative storytelling.HOWEVER, I recommend anyone interested in purchasing this DVD to avoid the Limited Edition at all costs and settle for the original version instead, unless you enjoy spending hours navigating through the pointless and stupid puzzles you are required to solve before you can access ANY of the features on the discs!I've heard some refer to this method as ""cute"" and ""amusing,"" but I'll wager anything most find it nothing but pure aggravation."
1,Chris Nolan should not have designed Limited Edition!,"I agreee with John from Houston - his review below - the battery of ""tests"" that Nolan has you complete before seeing anything on this disc is absurd. If you've got lot's of time on your hands and you love a puzzle, then the Limited Edition is for you. The packaging is cool and well done, but if you're like me, you got this edition because you love the movie so much you want more. Well, the ""more"" is so difficult to find, it isn't worth the effort."
5,A Fantastic Film,"I see that some reviewers have given away a bit more of the story than I would have, but this does save me the trouble of recapping anything.I'll just say that it's every bit the ""instant classic thriller"" promised on the DVD cover, that it's both full of action and mentally stimulating, and that I will watch it again, which I've never said about a ""thriller"" before. I'm also looking forward to watching the bonus DVD once I've let a little time pass, just to satisfy my curiosity.Oh yeah, and notice how the majority of us are giving this 5-star reviews. There's a reason we do that."
3,Ultimately disappointing,"While many will rave about the process of this movie, the sad fact is that the end/beginning is sorely lacking. It is hopelessly depressing. Anyone who's read the Count of Monte Christo knows how this one ends. But you cannot deny the process is brilliant."
5,Memento,"Memento is original, daring and creative. I never experienced quite the same tension in a live theater before as one could feel the whirling brains ticking and clicking as each viewer attempted to process the extraordinary plot. I could ""hear"" mental springs pop out loud as this movie-going audience desperately attempted to keep pace with, make sense of, and follow each twist and turn of the story's spine. A ""grabber"" in the true sense of the word, this film demands contemplation, reflection and respect."
3,Blu Ray does NOT contain the chronological order easter egg,"Just a warning to future purchasers: The Blu Ray version of Memento does not contain the easter egg from the dvd edition where you can watch the movie in order. That's the only reason I bought this, since I've seen it several times already."
4,A Very Effective Movie,"This movie is very well made, but it may be a bit tough for some people to digest. This movie starts you off at the ""end"" of the story and takes you back to the begining. You are immediately thrust into the life of a man with a type of memory loss that prevents him from remebering things for more than a few minutes at a time. He has no idea of what happened to him or why. The most ineresting thing about this movie is that for the most part you only know as much as he knows. This technique is very effective in that it keeps the viewer on the edge from the start of the movie to the surprising ending.Viewers are likely to be very turned off by this movie because of its head spinning pace, but whether you love it or hate it I guarantee that Memento is a movie that you will not soon forget."
2,"Ok, I read all the reviews, but ...","... there is nothing clever about this. I was really looking forward to this as the complexity and originality of it had been highlighted by many reviews. At the end of viewing it, I thought, this is over-rated. I see no point in showing a movie backwards - they've done it so we can put the pieces together ourselves - but why would we want to. The story isnt that great anyway. I've read that many distributors wouldn't buy this movie and I can see why. A big yawn."
1,Where is the clever ending?,Where is the clever ending? The entire movies builds to something you think you would never expect. I never expected such a bad ending. The ending is anticlimactic at best.
1,doodman gives memento the finger,"Contrary to popular belief, yes you do need to be a rocket scientist to figure out what the heck is going on. In addition, it was a bore unlike the equally confusing Mullhulland Drive."
2,So very dark,"My wife and I rented this movie and were really engrossed by the story. The writing, directing and acting are superb. However, I gave the movie two stars.Why? There is no representation of good in this film.Just when I felt that one of the characters was trying to be helpful and selfless the story flips back a scene and their motivations are painted more clearly. Everyone is exploiting everyone else. I'm not bothered by this from a moral point of view so much. What bothered me was that I found it difficult to sleep after watching this film.(...)"
1,this movie is very weird,"I choose to watch this movie, based on the good reviews of this movie in amazon.com.But this movie is very confusing, like a puzzle, scenes in the movie repeatback and forth.It is very hard to understand.After you come back from a good day of work, you want to relax with a nice movie, and after watching this movie, I feel terrible.How come so many good reviews of this movie, I don't understand these people.There is a pain in the butt peron in the office, I am going to recommend and give this movie for her to watch. HAHA"
2,Pointless!,"The film begins with Lenny shooting the man (or we're so led to believe) who he thinks raped and murdered his wife. The film then moves backwards in time because it wants the viewer to feel what it's like having short term memory loss just like Lenny, the main character. I admire the creativity, but it gets tedious. I almost lost all interest in the movie until Natalie provides a twist to the story. Then the end of the movie comes, which is actually the beginning of the story and the viewer discovers the truth: this movie was pointless to begin with!"
2,Someone with such a condition should not be carrying a gun ...,"...or he may kill the same person many times over.I saw this movie in a theater and in a few hours completely forgot about it, until month later, when visiting the same theater suddenly recognized it among the playing features. Perhaps the film had so powerful an effect that it caused in me a condition, similar to one of the protagonist (at least in relation to the contents of the movie itself). Or may be it was a lack of emotional depth, unrelated shallow characters, and complete absence of purpose that left me nothing to remember. I tend to believe it was the latter.Two stars for an honest attempt at originality."
2,CD fine but story line is confusing and depressing,"I heard this was such a good movie but I did not like it ...kind of depressing and weird. Thanks,"
5,A second look rewards,"I thought it was brilliant the first time around but,to get up-close-and-personal watching it on my Kindle, made it new again. Movies don't get any better than this!"
1,Strange,I was disappointed in this movie. The cast was great but the story was slow and not to my taste.
1,NOT for everyone,"Yes, it's an expensive cast. Yes, it's beautifully made. Yes, it makes an excellent job of conveying a particular mood.The trouble is, there is no let-up from that mood. Two hours of a downward spiral of doom, depression, angst, despair, and suicide, with no let-up at all. With no refrain from such melancholy I was relieved when it ended - the film is lacking in contrast somewhat.I wasn't left with anything at the end of the movie - just a desire to cheer myself up. It didn't make me question anything and it didn't raise any issues for me. I found it unchallenging - the only challenge was following the dense plot and the tedious, whispered monologues.Your mother might like it - but she'll wonder what you're trying to say when you give it to her."
4,Good movie - liked the way it was done.,"This movie is so different. It is such a deep story line, where several lives tie in and different plots going on. I like the depth of it, and the way it was narrated some, and the characters are all good. It is a sad one and it makes you think about alot of things... great acting. You have to pay attention in this."
1,The hours....,"What an awful, awful movie! Flitting through 3 lives, we discover 3 miserable people. No reason for this movie but to waste an hour and a half. The potential of these actors together would have been awesome but they were wasted on a trash movie."
2,superficial,"There are three interrelated stories in this movie, but each is essentially formulaic and, inevitably, none of them is explored in depth. The result is a series of snapshots which simply do not add up to a satisfying movie. Is there some interrelation between the stories which provides a payoff? Apart from the trite and obvious (time passes and things change) I see none. This is a very disappointing movie, in view of the accolades and high expectations."
1,Overacted from the start,"This was the most overacting in a film I have seen in a long time. I was going into to this film thinking this has 3 super actress of our lifetime. I turned out to be very boring and hard to watch. Yes, it seemed like HOURS and HOURS watching these actresses trying for an Oscar nomination.The story is tied to together with the writings of Virginia Wolffe and how it ""effected"" their lives. It ends up being a jumbled up mess and very confusing.The film was no joy or entertaining for that matter. It was a waste of 2 HOURS.Watch ""The Pianist"" to see how a film should be done with great acting but not overacting every role."
1,The Hours,"If you weren't depressed when you walked in to see this movie, you certainly will be by the time you finish it. Many customers walked out early and I wish I had. What a waste of talent.Don't bother to go see ""The Hours"". believe me you will find itvague, disjointed and distasteful. No one was happy, not even the serious little boy. He was so worried about his mother that he could think of nothing else. What a downer this movie is."
5,One of the best movies of 2002,The Hours is a very nice movie that earned 9 nominations and only won one oscar award(Best Actress-Nicole Kidman)This book even won an award.The adapted screenplay of the movie is one of the best adapted screenplays of 2002.This is a movie you must watch and a dvd you must have.
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"My wife purchased this movie on a recomendation from a friend. This movie was long, dull, and depressing. It's about 3 lesbians from different time periods who commit suicide? It goes back and forth between the women and thier dull lives. I knew from the first 5 minutes it was going to suck but my wife made me sit through this garbage. At the end we both were shocked at how displeasurable the experience was. I am baffled at how anyone could enjoy this."
2,Nicole Kidman? Who?,"Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore were equally as good if not better than Nicole Kidman in this movie. I really have to wonder why the academy gave the oscar only to Kidman.And... as I watched the extra interviews with the actresses, I found myself thinking, ""Who is that Nicole Kidman?"" She looks nothing like the Kidman I know today, December 22nd, 2004. What did she do to her face? Botox? Today there is no expression in her face and her eyebrows are flat. THAT Kidman, in those interviews is the princess we all fell in love with in film. The faded blonde hair of late, the flat eyebrows and expressionless brow take the uncommon beauty out of her.I gave this movie two stars for Mel Harris, Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Kidman. It was a mesmerizing film, but it was ultimately too in love with itself."
1,The movie that will make you snooze !,"I just try to figure out why they made this movie.The story is simple and it's possible to resume in few words : 3 lesbian and suicidal, bored in life women are living in different period time. That's it ! Nothing else. Isn't there a lack of something that makes a story interesting ? Yes ! This something is missing a lot. Believe me. It is boring and nothing happen except everlasting dialogues. This stuff should have been a book only. Showing the book and turn each page in front the camera could have been more exciting !Run away before you fall asleep."
1,Not a great piece of work,You need to be well versed in literature to understand this film - even then it is not a great piece of work. It is simply about depressed self-absorbed lesbians. There is little else for anyone that does not fit into one of those categories. Not even Kidman and Streep's superb acting skills could resurrect this film from the dust bin.
3,The most revolting movie of 2003,"It's been said that women love ""The Hours"" and men don't. That's a rather simplified analysis.I found this movie to be simply revolting. There wasn't one single woman in the entire movie who didn't annoy me. Meryl Streep's character is a pathetic creature in love with a man who can never love her back. Julianne Moore plays a selfish 1950s housewife who can't see the world beyond her own navel, and Nicole Kidman captured the Oscar for her portrayal of Virginia Wolf, the depressive and ultimately suicidal author.Every one of these women is presented as some kind of victim. None of them is responsible for her own actions and all them spend their time whining. This was an extremely dreary and lightweight movie."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Hours was pure Oscar bait--a prestigey adaptation of an intellectual novel (see The English Patient for another) with Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep for God's sake--but beneath its pretty shell the film is pretty empty; by no means a bad film, it's a decent drama that benefited from a good marketing campaign and December release."
2,Too melodramatic,"After and hour and I couldnt take The Hours anymore and shut it off. It's a shame the movie is so long, boring and moves nowhere. The acting is excellent, especially by Moore."
3,weird,"I like Meryl Streep's sunny character who is always busy planning parties & trying to make everybody's life better.She has a loving relationship with her partner ,Sally (played by the always wonderful Alison Janney) & her daughter,AJulia(claire daines). That was amazing how Meryl separated the egg yolks with just her fingers.Virginia Woolf & Richard were difficult but interesting characters. Both are brilliant,albiet tortured geniuses that were irreversibly hurt by adults that they trusted.It made me sad that the two of them had such a low opinion of themselves and felt they were ruining everyone around them.When in reality,so many people loved them ,warts and all.What I couldn't get my head around was Laura's character. There is no explanation about anything this woman does. It just seems like she is in a hurry to get nowhere and doesn't care who she hurts in the process.I mean,at least give me the reason she wants to leave her husband.Not trying to be judgemental but Laura made me sick."
5,3 Actresses deserve the academy award!,"I felt Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep all deserved the academy award. This movie is so excellant, and it stays with you.Its about three women, Nicole Kidman portraying Virgina Wolfe, Julianne Moore portraying a mother who wants to start a new life and is feeling overwhelmed, and meryl streep who is getting married but spends alot of her time taking care of a sick friend, and its starting to take its toll on her. this movie is beautifully filmed, acted and scored. Highly recommended."
4,A looking glass,"The film provides a sort of haven. If you've ever felt, even to the smallest degree,that psychological sort of battle where you are lowered into a deep well of doubts, uncertainty, questions, depression and may not understand it, this film exposes these feelings, opening spreading light over them. It's a sort of bittersweet touch on reality; and for those who may have experienced any level of sadness or confusion, even just a hint or a moment when you feel ""what does all this mean?"", from the simple questions of life to the more serious, complex questions of life, the movie's ability to capture that part of one's conscience is simply a gift the artistic creators of this movie gives to the audience. Aside from the psychological contributions it makes to the society of women who desire understanding of themselves more, it is also just a beautifully made and brilliantly composed film."
5,"Absolutlely worth ""The Hours"" To watch!","This move is truly one of the best dramas I have seen in a long time. All three of the three female leads are absolutely perfect, but Ms. Kidman definitely stands out as the best performance of the year. Definitely deserving of the Best Actress Oscar. The way it interweaves the three stories is compelling and moving to watch. It is brilliant in every way. When you watch this it will take you from tears to torment. You feel so passionately for all the characters, that you wish to reach out and help them. Definitely take out 'The Hours' to watch this movie."
3,Sadness with no escape,"Well, if this movie sets out to emphasize what Virginia Woolf was doing with ""Mrs. Dalloway"" or what Michael Cunningham was intending to achieve with his book, then the movie succeeds. At least with me. What is sad is to think a sad story may be what it takes to achieve it."
1,The Hours,this film was truly awful and a waste of my time...I thought there would be a deeper view of these women and their emotions in their time but the point was lost...took days to finally figure there was just no point to this movie..if you want to see these actresses kiss other women see it but if you are looking for some deep emotional drama that delves into the complexity of a woman don't bother seeing this.
2,"Technically good, horrible content","This film was excellent from a technical standpoint - the three timeframes were seamlessly blended and the cinema work was great. For that I give it 2 stars.Having said that, the story itself was little more than a blatant celebration of homosexuality and lesbianism. It is a sad testimony that so much effort is being made to 'make mainstream' a deviant lifestyle.Interesting that the advertising never points out the true nature of the film - otherwise, my wife and I would never have gone to see it."
1,Boring Beyond Belief,"My wife and buy movies to be entertained. After 45 minutes of this one, we looked at each other and said why are we watching this show. The title is appropriate however, minutes do seem like hours hanging on to this one."
2,they never should've made the movie,"even though all the actors did a great job and it is very faithful to the book, but you really wouldn't get this movie unless you read the book, which is much better and you get it more. The hours is really about inside one's mind, and no matter how hard you try, you just can't get that on screen. if you didn't read the book, the feeling you are getting from the hours is basically that there's something wrong with the women but you don't really know what, they just appear wrong. it's too awkward.go read the book, if you didn't like the book, don't even bother to see the movie."
2,Yawn,"Boring and pointless. If you want a deep and thoughtful film, try the foreign section of your video store. There is no motivation as to why Julianna Philips' character wants to kill herself. I don't think a failed birthday cake warrants such drastic measures. Her character is dull, and perhaps has more going on inside her head, then is relayed to the audience. And what about Kidman's fake nose and glasses. If an actor can't play the role from within her own instincts and needs cheap props to get them there, it's time to revisit acting class."
2,Dull,"I found this movie dull and two-dimensional. The plot is about three women in three different time periods (only separated by about 40 years each), who are depressed. The plot connects the people through a book by Virginia Woolf. I am not sure what the point of view of the writer was. There are several philosophical statements repeated. It seems that the movie is about people not living the way they want to live. It never seems to develop completely. However, the acting is superb. As a woman, I did not feel a connection to this movie."
3,A watchable drama,"This film is not perfect and was mundane at times. But it also had its great moments. Nicole Kidman was great in an almost unrecognizable role. She deserved her oscar. Julianne Moore's story line was perhaps the weakest and more boring, but she did a fine job. Meryl Streep is perfect, as always. It is definetetly woth a viewing."
5,What a wonderful chick flick,"I really enjoyed this rather dark and sad movie. It really made me go into my inner self and look at what is really important in life and what makes me happy. So if you want to laugh and watch a light type of movie, this is not for you! Julianne Moore gave such a brilliant performance as a depressed housewife in the 50's - she really should have won the Oscar! The other actors were brilliant as well.My husband and teenage son absolutely hated this movie - so I must say that it definitely goes into the chick flick group. It deals so much with feminine issues that most men will not be able to understand it. But I found it haunting and thought provoking."
1,Hollywood's self-indulgent mess,"Yes, it's Virginia Wolfe, and yes it's Streep, Kidman and Moore, all very well respected actors. But COME ON! I hated it. It's so DEEP that one is supposed to bow down and grovel at its' inner meaning and mensa level plot. Kidman was better in Days of Thunder and Eye Wide Shut (that statement was sarcasm for those who weren't sure).Oh well, I've never felt the impulse to write one of these reviews before but I just felt compelled to air my feelings. I absolutely love the movies. I am seduced by good plots and great characterizations. This was boring and tedious. Don't waste your time or money unless you need to have something to chat about at your next afternoon tea in the Hamptons."
2,Overrated Sobfest,"I can't understand why people raved about it. It is full of neurotic people, self-centered, solipsistic characters who take themselves so seriously and with such verbosity against a background of plaintive music that you're grateful when someone finally succeeds at dying.The movie is very good at evoking the sense ofclaustrophobia that the characters feel, but the characters are not themselves interesting enough to justify the overwrought emotions this movie tries to stampede over us.Interesting narrative structure, interweavingthree separate stories, two of which mirror events in Woolf's book Mrs. Dalloway, and a surprise ending. Still,a disappointment and hardly deserving of the raves it got."
5,The Hours...Nicole Kidman,A well written and produced movie. It is though provoking and deep. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It is a film I will watch again and again. Highly recommended for the deep woman.
3,A Bit Choppy...,"The overall story of this film is great, with great dialogue, interesting characters. Somewhat strange character in Julianne Moore...I was just waiting for her to do something really strange, but it never happened!! With this deep movie, the viewer really has to stay focused, and think. This is a film that has really good intentions, but is very choppy. As soon as you get used to one idea, the whole story changes, and you basically have to wait till the end for the complete story to be pulled together. Some suprises...very interesting!"
1,Only One Hour,"Only One Hour was all I could handle before I decided ""this just isn't going to get any better,"" and headed for the lobby.I admire all of the the actresses here. They have each been in an excellent role recently. Further, I admire Virginia Woolf, one of the pioneers of Modern literary technique. But this grumpy film about three women who are unhappy for some inexplicable reason, surrounded by their sad friends, un-understood by servants and loving husbands, relatives, children, inflicted needless cruelty on its viewers. Yes, I get the idea that they are repressed lesbians, and they may want to commit suicide over something which seems trivial to others, but did they have to be so unrelievedly grim about it? A magnificent wallow in self-involvement. Let young people see this film only as a punishment for truly bad behavior."
1,Too Boring to Watch,"I'm so glad I didn't buy this movie but only rented it.I looked forward to seeing it all the way home from work, but found it so boring that I turned it off after only 10 minutes.I must give a word of praise for the makeup artists, though. They did a wonderful job of transforming Nicole Kidman's face into a semi-resemblance of Virginia Wolf."
3,Wife hated it!,"I didn't mind this one, but my wife could not stand it. The critics liked it, but not our household. www.jafguitar.com"
1,As fun as being smashed in the kidneys with a hammer,"Perhaps I am biased in that I wish Virginia Woolf was still alive so I could run her over in my car. Twice. But aside from the fact that this film was based on that repulsive stain on literature that is Woolf, it was still horrendous. All the characters are so uninteresting that you want them to die within the first 10 minutes just so something exciting will happen. Kidman looks likes she's suffering severe constipation for most of the film, although that may just be the fact that she's playing such a ridiculously boring character that she has no choice but to try and add some personality. If you have the choice between seeing this film or running face first into a wall, pucker up and plant a big one on that slab of concrete, because your head will hurt less than sitting through this crapfest. I hate Virginia Woolf."
3,Bitter Disappointment,"I'm sure I read a favorable review of ""The Hours"" when it was first released, but just my luck I chose a day and a mood that was dreary to begin with before viewing it. Whoa; big mistake! So why do I give it three stars, you ask? Simply because I think most movies are even worse somehow; too full of stereotypes and testosterone. At least ""The Hours"" is lousy in less typical ways. To put it another way, I'd rather be depressed and suicidal than blown to bits or caught up in a horrible car chase...nevertheless, it's not a choice I wish to be confronted with. So I haven't bothered to watch it in its entirety, and I don't recommend that anyone should, unless of course you happen to like utterly humorless non-stories about depressive space cadet women from various time frames of the 20th century (and just beyond). OR, if you'd simply like to muse over how much a fake nose makes Nicole Kidman resemble her ex-husband, Tom Cruise."
5,hey zeus christo - what a film,"It has been a very long time since i have seen a movie that has moved me so incredibly. This film was perfectly made, with the plot of each of the womens' lives weaved intricately together. Standing out as perhaps the best aspect The Hours has to offer is the powerful performances that Julianne Moore (who can act, let me tell ya), Meryl Streep, and Nicole Kidman. With an equally emotionally stirring score to go along with it, this was a great film, to say in the least."
2,Airy Fairy Ending,"I found the movie to be a bit too melodramatic. The first two women suffered from the claustrophobic pressures of their societies. But Meryl Streep's character I didn't get. I could not understand why she was so miserable unless it was over the loss of happiness she used to have with her AIDS-ridden ex-lover Richard. He did nothing to ease her pity for him and almost blamed her for being selfish in missing the happiness they shared instead of allowing him to die in peace. Ungrateful, if you ask me.In the end, Julianne Moore's character creates a sort of closure for all those involved, but I certainly have not seen the results of that closure. I'm still confused. What was resolved, if anything was resolved at all? The theme of the movie went along the right dramatic lines but the ending just fizzed away. Performances were rightfully brilliant but story line just a bit too airy fairy for me. Not a heavy drama, but not a light drama either. Watch it if you have the patience."
4,I liked it,"Another dark movie. The characters were all wonderful and once I ""got"" it, enjoyed it alot. Would probably watch again to get more out of it"
1,Too Much Fuss Over a Bad Movie,"The plot of this movie was basically about three suicidal, depressed, lesbians in different time periods who all had something to do with the book ""Mrs. Dalloway"". I spent the entire movie trying to figure out the point of it and when it ended I was confused and disgusted. I think this movie was a waste of The Hours I spent watching it."
3,Slightly Overrated...,"I am not going to waste time by expounding on the films narrative structure and characters. Judging from all the hype, reading this you should already be aware of the omnipresent plaudits and praise this film has generated. All you've heard is warranted, although I can't help feeling that there's and inherent smugness which underscores Daldry's adaptation of the pulitzer prize-winning novel. The high literary pretensions Daldry, Kidman, Streep and co. were aspiring to are blatantly bourgeois, and to the keen watcher and listener their beningnly flippant, aloof and ever-so-slightly-dismissive collective attitude towards the audience is more than a little irking. The film left me feeling curiously played by the proverbial puppet master, in this case the filmakers, having stoically expounded their relatively myopic, proto liberal feminist/lesbian rhetoric with maximum precision and clinical grace.Excellently made, but proceed gingerly."
1,Could barely make it through it....,"I'm sorry - but this movie was horrible! I would classify myself as an average american, and this just did NOT appeal to me at all. I will give a huge kudo to Nichole Kidman for her performance, but other than that - it was awful. I get so tired of people continously putting the ""beautifully creative"" label on any movie that portrays homosexuality in a positive role.Pass on this one....please."
2,"pretentious drivel, but oh so significant!","pretentious and obvious and oh-so-significant; in other words, is this not the PERFECT movie for meryl streep? a big disappointment from stephen daldry, after the wonderful debut as film director in ""billy elliott"". nicole kidman won one of the most undeserved oscars since luise rainer, nd i usually like her. and oh god, theres that ""important"" philip glass score ..."
1,Of No Value,"A movie with incredible shallow character development. It replicates the view of every misogynist that woman have no meaningful life other than the one driven by their own hormones. If I were a woman (or feminist) I would be insulted by this manic-depressive, ""lesbianic"", incestuous world that has been created. It offers nothing, makes no point and has no relevance. If acting means extracting all joy from your words and facial mannerisms then the acting was great... if it means more than that it was horrid. What a dog of a movie."
2,"A focus on pain, with painful music","The acting's pretty good in places -- but that's all.The surest sign of what you're in for in this kind of Hollywood Spectacle is the music -- driving you to believe something important is happening, when nothing is happening. Even the music goes nowhere -- it starts with portent and ends with portent -- the typically lightweight range and depth of a self-important 'modern' idiot like Philip Glass.Anyway, that's just the most irritating thing about a movie that says nothing about death because it says nothing about life -- except symbolically in an oft-repeated story about 'a particular morning on the beach'. We're supposed to feel ""what a bunch of trapped people -- maybe we're all trapped -- but maybe there's hope"". I know this because the point is made at the beginning and is remade dozens of times -- focusing on the same pain endlessly, in a flat movie where nothing will unfold but your cerebellum."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"The Hours has an audience in people who share the void suffered by its characters. That void is where a life is supposed to be. If you are one of these people, then get a life. The rest of us found The Hours unforgivably dull."
1,"awful, pretentious, boring waste of talent","this film is a plotless melodrama about selfish, self-absorbed people. it was dull, pretentious and boring. the only straight male characters were weak and codependent(mr. virginia woolf) or clueless(mr. julianne moore). reverse the genders of the male stereotypes and there would have been an outcry of political incorrectness. don't waste your time. one would think that with this many stupendous actors that something better could have been made of it all but alas...it was terrible!"
4,"Really good, but not as good as most people say","I guess part of the dissapointment that came after seeing ""The Hours"" was that I was expecting a groundbreaking, opinion-changing movie with a subtle message. It may sound like a lot to expect but so many people were saying this, including a man my mother heard say that he ""came out of the movie theater changed"". When I saw it I was confused, and couldn't find a deep message. I later found out the whole thing was about the difficulties of being [different], especially back in the past. This is a sad subject to touch on, the style of putting three layers of time periods in the movie is a wonderful concept, the cast is great. My expectations forced me to expect something utterly amazing, but it's just a really good movie. (On a superficial level, Nicole Kidman manages to look pretty even with that prosthetic nose on... ..."
3,Too 'Chick Flick' - At least for me...,"Let's start with the only good thing about this movie: the acting, which is spectacular, as you can expect from the cast. This alone deserves the 3 stars I've given it.The story moves between 3 shorter stories: the story of Virginia Woolf, set in the 20's while writing 'Mrs. Daloway', a story of a housewife set in the late 40's / early 50'd era reading 'Mrs Daloway', and the story of a modern day 'Mrs. Daloway', set in 1999.The story moves very slowly between all three threads, interconnecting them throughout it. The depth is supposedly given by the interlocking emotional issues between the 3 stories (hence the 'chick flick' reference). But I felt that the movie focused too much on this emotional connection between the women, and neglected to make me care about them as characters, or their relationship."
2,Well-acted but hard to understand,"This movie has beautiful acting and cinematography but it is difficult to pick up the various threads and make sense of them, particularly if you are unfamiliar with the Virginia Wolfe novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway"". The movie centers around three women, Virginia Wolfe, played by a hard-to-recognize Nicole Kidman; an unhappy young housewife from the 50's, played by Julianne Moore; and a modern-day woman played by Meryl Streep. Their stories interweave with one another and there are common themes of mental illness, lesbianism and unhappy women with death wishes. Not exactly light entertainment! There were times when I wanted to tell the main characters to snap out of it and get on with life rather than wallow in the melancholy and self-pity which they display. This is a movie designed more for art than for entertainment, so be forewarned."
2,Unstable,"Surely you have seen or at least heard of Clint Eastwood's ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly?"" Well ""The Hours"" would more appropriately be titled ""The Insane, the Unhappy, and the Confused."" Yes it was beautifully filmed. Yes it was well acted. But what is the point? Oh, by the halfway mark I had consumed 2.5 bourbons so maybe I missed the point. If you are male, stay away. And if you have a wife or girlfriend, keep her away from it."
5,Soul touching stories and performances,"My husband and I own this DVD, and we have watched them over and over again, and yet, we also seem to enjoy watching different parts of the stories at different times. The story and the performace of Virginia Wolff gave me the greatest impact because of her depicting of the Bipolar Disorders. It has truly brought us more understanding about this Disorder and have more compassions toward people who are suffered from mental illnesses or any illnesses. It's a have to own DVD, and we love it very much!"
3,Three guys,"If you see this movie, there are three guys you should not let slip past your attention: 1. Phillip Glass, whose score plays (for me) a much-more-than-ordinary role both in holding the meandering stories together and in guiding/evoking emotional response. Without this score, you'd have a much less powerful film. 2. Ed Harris, who plays the manic-depressive waves of his character with energy and vividness, and 3. Jack Rovello, Ed Harris' character as a child. His face carries the combination of incomprehension and intuitive knowing that young children can have. As for the rest of the film, you have a bunch of other reviews to read!"
5,brilliant-very very good- great,"this movie is great, i've never read anything or seen another movie that captures the mood and atmosphere of depression closer than this movie....just brilliantthat being said; who wants to be entertained with depression? no one really!!! so while this movie may come off as slow and boring, its not, it is very very accurate, i used to not care much for nicole kidman until i saw this film, she is perfect, awesome, i really mean perfect"
1,Artistic Waste of Time,"The Hours left me with a sense of emptiness. Although the performances of Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Ed Harris were at times brilliant, I found the story to be an artistic tribute to sadness, dispair and confusion. The intertwining stories left me often confused and discouraged by the inability of the characters to do anything positive to change their lives. Instead they focus on death as a solution and give the impression that everything in life is hopeless. This is another case of Hollywood trying to show how intellectual it can be and missing the point."
4,A gang primer in one book,"This edited volume provides a balanced approach to gangs that includes defining and measuring gang participation in several urban settings. Special attention is given to the role of ethnicity and gender in gang involvement. Most importantly, the book integrates individual behavioral factors with ecological and socioeconomic dimensions that contribute to an increase in gang activity. The book ends with several case studies of community responses. Edited by one of the leading gang scholars, this is a must read."
1,Slooooooow.......kept checking how much time was left,"Wow - this is the slowest movie I've seen in a long time. Slow slow slow. Any other Harrison Ford move is way better. I think this is by far his worse flick and the worst and slowest I've seen in a long time. I kept checking how much time was left and looking for places I could fast forward a quick 30-90 seconds. Yuck.Reviews are 1-5 stars which makes average a 3 (1+5)/2 instead of an average of 2.5 (0+5)/2 which would be true if one could give 0 stars. Being the worse flick I've seen in a long time, I would give it a 0 if possible. Mentally I subtract about 1/2 point from averages overall reviews to get a more accurate product rating."
4,A brilliant Hitchcockien Thriller.,"Harrison Ford proves his versatility once again with this film. He plays a man who will stop at nothing to get his wife back. Roman Polanski uses his unlimited directing skills to create suspence and realism like no other. It is never unbelievable or over-the-top, and the pace fits the film well. It would have gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the slight anti-climax. Emmanuelle seigner is a great find in her Film debut."
3,Good movie. Bad DVD,"I don't understand Warner's policy of releasing DVD. They chose this good movie to be released as part of their budget line ($15 list price). First of all the picture quality is not as good as the Laserdisc and it is not in wide screen. No special features at all. A waste of DVD capabilities. This movie deserve to be remastered. But if you can forgive the technical parts, the movie itself is very good. Harrison Ford stars as an American surgeon who lost his wife in a hotel in Paris."
4,Polanski lost some tempo in the movie,"At some point I felt the movie was turning into a detective story with elements of action. I was quite dissappointed with the finale - again Arab terrorist, US national security at stake, dumb US embassy agents. Multiple deja vu. Desole. I excpected something more original and kinkier, smth darker and deeper. Overall, it's always a pleasure to see smth different from mainstream simplified ugliness."
3,A Satisfactory thriller,"Um, in general this movie is good, but I was left with the feeling that Betty Buckley was miscast as Harrsion Ford's wife. She looked too old for him. And the film totally belongs to Ford and Emmanuelle Seigner. This is a medium-paced gripping movie and you won't feel cheated after the viewing."
3,"Great movie, but the dvd is terrible!","I think this is one of my favorite movies of all times, yes I am a sucker for movies set in Paris! And the fact that this is a mystery thriller of sorts.The movie itself is good, i've watched it at least 5 times, but the dvd is HORRIBLE (that's why the 3 stars rating). There is NOTHING in this dvd, just the movie. Not even subtitles or a trailer.The movie itself doesn't look that great when played. It lacks the smooth quality of dvd movies.I hope they re-release it because it is just aweful. Really disappointed with the quality of the dvd!!"
1,"Good movie, bad DVD","I would love to buy this movie on DVD, but only after good features have been added. First of all, widescreen. No DVD should be released without the original aspect ratio. Second, this Paris-based movie should have full French language support. I checked other regions for this DVD and it *is* available in widescreen with French, but not here in Region 1 (where both English and French are official languages -- both languages should be supported in both audio and subtitles on all Region 1 DVDs). Other DVD features, such as audio commentaries, featurettes, and other forms of information, would be much appreciated."
2,Could be better,Should have been written as acceptable or even worse. Plastic covering had cuts in it and the paper cover was cut and very scuffed.
1,frantic,This is an excellent polanski film for personal film noir. Ford does a great yet subliminal character formed from a simple plot to recover his wife from a mysterious disapearance. An involved story that is more eclectic than straight forward in it's telling....
1,One of Harrison's worst...,"After I watched this, I was frantically trying to get my money back. Having been too young to see it when it came out in the theaters, I thought that I'd give it a try on DVD. I've loved pretty much everything that Ford has been, but this one certainly does not go on my list. I think that the basic premis of the movie is a good one... man and wife go to exotic foreign city, woman vanishes from hotel room, man scratches his head, hotel offers no clue, man goes crazy (or becomes frantic, i guess)... but the main chunk of the movie, the 'frantic' part, is put together poorly.. it is hard to follow, at best, and the collection of characters that Ford encounters is a blur. This movie is best watched on cable on a Sunday afternoon as you fall asleep on the couch.. do NOT waste your money on a personal copy of the DVD!"
3,Good film,"On the plus side - this is a fine film with another good performance from Harrison Ford (why doesn't he do more films like this nowadays?) There are touches of humour in this film in addition to the tension. Good performances all round.There are 3 black marks against this DVD though.1) No extra features - not even subtitles or alternative languages.2) Poor transfer - the film is watchable but for a lot of the film the picture quality is poor.3) The end titles slip into 1.85:1, proof that this is a widescreen film - making sense of the various scenes with half faces. I had always thought this was a full screen film so I was annoyed to find out otherwise."
1,"DVD 1 star, movie 3 stars","FRANTIC is not among the best of Polanski's movies, in fact it represents one step in his decline. However, he is/was a serious filmmaker, and the movie deserves to be presented in its correct 1:85 to 1 format.The same goes for ARTHUR, the same goes for CHARLEY VARRICK. Also MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON, perhaps Paul Mazursky's best movie, full screen only. Very good movies incomprehensibly marketed in full screen.I would be delighted to see My Cousin Vinnie or American Pie released full screen, because they deserve it. Junk release for junk movie.Do not even think about buying this."
3,Polanski in a slump,"An American doctor in Paris (Harrison Ford) searches for his wife (Betty Buckley), who has been kidnapped due to a luggage mix-up at the airport. It begins with promise, but the plot never really develops any momentum and culminates with a desultory gunfight that offers no suspense, no revelations, and no excitement. Roman Polanski is a gifted director. He made some brilliant films before this and he would make some great ones later, but ""Frantic"" feels like its on autopilot."
1,Not Harrison Ford's best movie,This movie was very slow and didn't have a story line. I would not reccomend it to anyone! Big wast of time!
2,Warning,"This is a fairly entertaining thriller with a nice performance by Harrison Ford in his standard 'everyman' role to recommend it. Unfortunately Emmanuelle Seigner looks lost in her role and gets blown off the screen in every scene she and Ford share. But be warned, this DVD lacks any bonus materials and can only be viewed in pan/scan mode. There are no titles, no chapter index, not even a selection menu at the beginning of the movie (no features to select from). It doesn't seem as if the picture has been enhanced nor has the sound been remastered. Pretty lame."
2,Frantic needs better,"Great movie, but what's with the pan and scan dvd? Polanski is a great director and his movie needs a better treatment on dvd. How about widescreen please? This is a great film and it would be nice to see all of the image as the director intended. Thanks in advance."
5,Le Meilleur!,"I bought this book about 5 years ago. Just casually flipped through it and read only parts (I don't why). Now, I've found another copy and have read it from cover to cover. I honestly don't think I was ready (5 yrs ago) to tackle the suggestions in this book. I am now.I can't think of anything that's more inspiring or more helpful for getting the French look. I've read all of Anne Barone's books (helpful) and the tres terrible French Chic and this is absolute best..hands down.The best thing I have come away with from this book is that you don't needs tons of money to create that French allure. The tips and tricks in the book anyone can do and will create that mystique you're after.Today, I decided to mix navy and black together (as the book says ""Very French"") and I've gotten a few second glances. Shock les bourgeois...ooh I do feel so very French!Get your hands on a copy of this book and don't let go!Amusez-vous bien!"
3,Fun read but tres expensive,"This book came highly recommended, and I had the opportunity to obtain it for far less than the usual list price of vendors [$60+] Being OOP has alot to do with it. It's a softback book, measuring about 8x9"", less than 100 pgs with lots of illustrations and photographs. It was informative and enjoyable, but NOT worth that kind of cash, unless you're a collector. If you can locate it in a library - terrific! Otherwise, check out authors Anne Barone, Mireille Guiliano and others who have imparted and expanded on similar information about the allure of ""French Women."""
3,For $6 it's okay,"I agree, the photography and graphics are fun, though nothing unique for a book about style or fashion. The text is interesting at best, yawn. I could have made a much better choice at Half Price Books, ho hum. Basically, it's a book that belongs in a powder room and the next time I have a week to kill sitting in front of a vanity mirror, I may finish it."
4,perfect for a high school francophile,"I loved this book when I was in high school, and still remember (and use)some of the tips."
3,"A Mediocre Book, But Essential For Any Pete Rose Fan","I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the strange and unfortunate saga of Pete Rose. It offers his version of the ""truth"" regarding his banishment from baseball as well as his views about his magnificent career. Although the book features the information most fans would want to know, it is not structured well. Roger Kahn organizes the book as almost a dialogue between Rose and himself, which gives the reader the feeling that the book is cut and pasted together from random interviews. The transitions from Kahn's views to Rose's views are sloppy and at times confusing. It is hard to believe that Kahn spent three years writing this book.Buy the book for its information and overlook the unfortunate fact that Pete Rose selected the wrong person to write his biography. Roger Kahn was either loafing through the project or he was severely past his prime. Maybe he should have ""hung `em up"" when Pete Rose did."
4,A GOOD READ,"PETE ROSE DOES A GOOD JOB IN THIS STORY CONCERNING HIS CAREER AND PRIVATE LIFE. THE CONTROVERSY CONCERNING HIS GAMBLING IS DONE IN GREAT DETAIL AND IS A STAND OUT. PETE COMES ACROSS AS BEING CONFIDENT AND AT TIMES COCKY, HONEST, AND ARROGANT. I ADMIRE PETE THE BALL PLAYER, BUT AS A HUMAN BEING HE IS NOT A MODEL CITIZEN. I FOUND THIS BOOK WELL WRITTEN AND QUITE INTERESTING. A MUST FOR PETE ROSE FANS."
3,Decent at Best,The book was very well written and was very good up until the time when Rose was charged with gambling. When it got at this time Rose talked around every single topic he was asked. Because of this book I am 99% sure Pete Rose bet on baseball.
2,"runs small, not great quality","Thinking that this tank looked like cool workout wear, I took the gamble and ordered it. Beware that it runs very small. I usually wear a small or medium. I ordered the medium so that I'd have room to move, but it is skin tight. Also the ribbing in the fabric runs crooked, making it look a bit cheap. It will be fine for sleep wear, but I'd never wear it to the gym or anywhere else."
1,"dreadfully redundant, redone and forgotten elevator music","I really wanted to give it a 0 rating, but the review guidelines require at least a 1. I am sorry I wasted the money and listening time on this 3-set CD. I have listened to all tracks of these redundant and monotonous, rerecorded tunes most of which are poorly executed by the ""various"" artists. I will now toss it in the ""who cares"" file and hopefully never have to listen to it again. I have most of these tunes on one CD or another by ""good artists"". Sorry, but I just find no redeeming listening value here. Good enough for elevators I suppose. Anybody want to buy a 3-CD set of worn out songs barely used?"
1,I only give it 1 star because that's the lowest you can go!,"This is NOT what I expected at all. I simply wanted a cd with the sounds of a rain storm...that's it. I didn't expect to get some cheesy music played very poorly. You can barely hear the rain over the music. The CD states that it's ""Rain Storms: Sounds of Nature."" Any person should be able to safely assume this does not include music. I guess I assumed wrong. Don't buy this."
2,Rain Storms by Sounds of Nature,I was very disappointed in this CD. I did not expect a guitar in the foreground. If I wanted guitar music I would have ordered that! I just wanted sounds so I could create an atmosphere for myself.
4,Good And Very Entertaining,My 5 year old granddaughter really enjoys watching this whole series. She wants to watch them over and over. They all seem to have great lessons and messages for kids to learn. This one was good and very entertaining.
5,Fantastic movie and series for children of any age!!,"The entire LBT series, and this movie in particular, deals with issues that all kids, parents and families are faced with on a daily basis (love, friendship, trust, just to name a few). The family issues include single parenting and adoption (both touch my family) and it is a great way for my son to learn that each family is different. In this particular movie, Littlefoot and his friends are dealing with ""bullies"" and it is a perfect chance for parents and children to discuss how to deal with other children who may not be as nice as they are. My son, who is almost 5, names all dinosaurs after the LBT characters, we have the CD playing in the car most of the time and he watches both of the Singa-a-Long tapes constantly. I know he learns something new each time he watches one of the movies because of the discussions we have. I cannot praise this series enough!!"
5,Great Family Entertainment,These are great family & children films with values and lessons. We have the complete series now.
2,Wishing it was a DVD...,I love the movie and am returning this product. I already have it in a VHS...was looking for the DVD and misread what I was purchasing. Nothing wrong with the company just my error in reading.
2,It would have been a great movie...if the dvd had worked.,I sent this to my husband who is serving our country overseas. He loves land before time movies and I wanted him to feel comforted by the cute cartoon while he has to be away from his family during the holidays. It did not arrive on time and when it did arrive it did not play. We are now ALL very disapointed.
5,Great for kids!,My children watched these movies in VHS and loved them. Now I am purchesing them for my grandchildren and they also love them. These are a new and upcomming kids classics in my opinion. I am trying to buy most of the line. Love them!
2,childrens movie,"I remember watching the first couple of these as a kid and enjoyed them quite a bit. I didn't remember that they turned them into almost musicals after the first one however. This is a great childrens movie, but nothing really there for adults."
1,Scary for young children; contains name-calling and teasing,This series of videos is scary for young children. Do not let the G rating fool you. I watched the video with my three year old son who loves dinosaurs and he was scared during several of the scenes. Also there is a lot of name-calling and teasing in the videos. Not something I want my child learning. Very poorly done story lines. Pick Dinosaur Train or Dino Dan instead!
3,new isnt' always beter,i like this lbt but the one on dvd and tv is difrent and difrent and new isnt always better its mesing someting
2,The Time of Great Confusion,"I couldn't understand if they were speaking language or else not. Sometimes I lay awake at night and wonder if this is how those graceful creatures spoke to each other. Although this movie was a bit too artsy for me, I still thought it was pretty good even though I couldn't understand what they were saying. Overall, this is my third favorite Land Before Time movie, only the seventh and the ninth are much better. Littlefoot still rules the Jurassic Period."
1,"Warning, Warning! Not suitable for children!!!! 0 stars!","""Hip"" the young bully dinosaur refers to Littlefoot, Cera and the other young dinosaurs as big babies. He also uses the words stupid and dumb. This is very unfortunate for an otherwise wonderfully creative concept. I now find myself trying to explain to a 2 year old that these are unacceptable things to say......."
3,Handle smells terrible,"I bought this knife for my mom as a gift because she wanted a good sharp knife. She loved it at first. It cuts very smoothly and was very sharp. The sharpness doesn't last long. 2 months of light to normal use and it was no longer sharp. I realize knives don't stay sharp forever, but I expected more. The worst part about the knife is the handle. It smells like urine very badly. It even makes your hand stink after using it...even after washing your hands. My mom has tried to get the smell out by soaking it in hot soapy water and also soaking it in baking soda. Neither helped a bit. It actually stinks so bad that she is thinking about sending it back. If you touch the food you're cutting with the hand that held the handle of the knife, your food tastes like urine. It's the strangest thing ever!"
4,Better than expected,"This is a live album for fans who are knowledgeable about Dylan's music and how he approaches playing his songs in a live concert setting. You might catch yourself looking at the CD cover to see what the heck is being played. This has been a trait of Dylan's live performances for some time and is true today. He is an artist who is constantly re-imagining and re-arranging his songs. Tangled Up In Blue is almost a completely different song, with rewritten lyrics but basically the same melody. Mick Taylor rips off some amazing solos as usual. I had read mediocre reviews about this one, but it really rocks and I like the different arrangements. The only ding is that the band can't get the reggae beat of I and I. Otherwise I would rate this as one of the best pre-Bootleg Series live CDs of Dylan's career, second only to the stunning Before The Flood. This can be found at the big boxes for a little as $4.99 so go looking for it."
4,more bob live,At least the third Maggie's farm on a Columbia records live Dylan album (that I've heard). The best part is hearing the man make changes to his song's arrangements on the never-ending stage where he's lived. If you need more Bob than this CD is what you're looking for.
3,"I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran","Dylan has in recent years, developed a live sound that travels seamlessly from acoustic performances to electric ones. On this offering though, there are two distinct presentations: Mick Taylor garage band blues or solo acoustic. My preference is the solo acoustic performances of ""Tangled...""(with new lyrics), ""Girl from the North Country"", and ""It Ain't Me Babe"" (with spontaneous crowd sing along). Of the two offerings from Infidels, ""License to Kill"" is sloppy and just isn't one of Bob's best songs; ""I and I"" is better in studio. The remaining offerings are electric and range from good to below average. All in all, worth the money and will sit in your CD player for quite some time if only for the acoustic performances."
2,"More like ""Real Lousy""","First, let me say I'm a Dylan fan. Second, let me say this album stinks. Dylan is near his nasally, incomphensible worst here. It's a chore getting through this album. I listened to this once and then gave it to a co-worker. The only thing saving this from one-stardom is his excellent band, led by ex-Stone Mick Taylor, and some great work (there's a shock) from guest Carlos Santana. Unless you're a Dylan completist, take a pass."
2,Real Bad,"This is not a very good live album. The sound quality is not too good and performance is not too exciting except for some nice guitar solos. It has 10 songs ranging from 4 to 6 minutes long. The total lenght of the CD is 52 minutes.The sound quality is not very good. It is loud and noisy. The audience chatter is way too high in many spots. You can actually pick out some talking in the back ground.This is one of Dylan's lesser performances. His singing is particularly annoying. He vocals are very affected. He sounds like one of those comedians who do a bad imitation of Dylan with the over exaggerated accent.The back up band is not very good and renditions of the songs are not anything new or special.The only thing that makes this CD worthwhile are some amazing guitar solos on 4 of the tracks. And no wonder...the guitarist is Mick Taylor, of Rolling Stones and Gong fame. But, the guitar playing is not enough to recommend this CD.This is Dylan's second worst CD. His worst is Dylan and Dead."
1,Wow!,"Dylan's 9,975,232nd live album in two years and, you know what?, ""Maggie's Farm"" and ""Ballad of a Thin Man"" still haven't lost their bite!!! No, really. I'm not kidding. I really mean it! Really! I'm serious. This guy's so good and his songs are so good that you just never get tired of him. No, really. I'm serious, he really is........................."
2,No Drums?!?!?,"Was not a pleased with this as I'd hoped..had a very short version of ""Big Country"" without the wonderful drum solo at the beginning. I wound up purchasing the original ""Big Country"" CD instead and have since sold this one to someone else."
2,Great Music- Horrendous Remastering,"This album features some great music from an extraordinary band... Unfortunately it suffers from terrible remastering. Straying far from Big Country's trademark bass-heavy, echoey, drum-heavy mix (listen to the Crossing & Seer), the engineer on this reissue leans more for a brittle, clean, dry, highly treble sound that is altogether displeasing & far from Big Country's original vision. I recommend instead purchasing the reissue of ""The Crossing"" which has been masterfully remastered AND includes several stunning bonus tracks that date from Big Country's early & most prolific era!"
4,The alternative is a bit better,"This is a good retrospective of one of the most underrated bands of our time. This anthemic, honest, Celtic-influenced real rock is not for everyone, but for those it touches, there is nothing that compares. This music is withstanding the test of time and these guys just released the finest collection of their career with 1999's ""Driving To Damascus"". ""The Buffalo Skinners"" is another essential latter-day release. This ""best of"" is almost identical to the U.K. release, ""Through A Big Country"". Unfortunately, the fine tracks, ""The Seer"" and ""Eiledon"", were dropped and the ok ""Heart of the World"" and the positively annoying political rant, ""Republican Party Reptile"", were added. ""Through A Big Country"" (remastered) gets the 5 stars. Stay alive."
5,I THINK THEY ARE POPULAR IN THE U.K. BUT...,"not here in the USA. And that's to bad. i got this CD originally for its one hit I knew of: ""in a big country"". but after listening to it a few times, i discovered that there were some really deep lyrics and melodies on this CD. There Scottish roots are very apparent, which adds to the total feeling of this CD.A MUST IF YOU LOVE '80'S U.K. ROCK"
4,"What About ""Look Away""?","Good cd. I hadn't heard that much from them except their biggest U.S. hit ""In A Big Country"" and the song I bought it for, ""Look Away"". It wasn't huge in the U.S., 'tho it did reach the MTV Top 20 Video Countdown in 1986. It was one of their biggest hits in the U.K., though, I understand."
5,CLEVER,"As usual with her books based off of nursery rhymes, Christie makes a clever read with this novel. (Think And Then There Were None, One, Two, Buckle My Shoe...) The fact that all the characters are easily potential suspects until they get killed off only makes this case a little more baffling and a little more fascinating. DO buy this if you've read some of Christie and are looking for a worthwhile read."
5,One of Agatha Christie's best!!!!!!,"I usually love Hercule Poirot books more than Ms. Marple, but I decided to read this book anyway. I found myself engrossed in the book. There are the perfect amount of twists and turns to keep you interested and guessing. The end was amazing! I never would have guessed who the murderer was if I hadn't finished the book. I absolutely recommend this book if you enjoy reading Agatha Christie's novels. You won't find much better!"
3,Not one of Christie's best.,"Although this mystery is written with Agatha Christie's signature style, it falls far below her best work. Every suspect is guilty of something, but which is guilty of murder? There are many twists in this unusual plot with a child's nursery rhyme always in the back of your mind. And, of course, there is a red herring. Don't let this title be your first of Christie's novels"
3,Good Read,Agatha Christie keeps you guessing right till to the end (as usual). This was a enjoyable read with heaps of red herrings and twists. If you are an Agatha fan you will like this book with her use of a nursery rhyme as the backdrop for the murder of an obnoxious businessman who when found had a pocket full of rye. If you know the rhyme you will follow the plot easily.
3,Good,"I seriously enjoyed this Christie book. I know it isn't perfect, but the plot is believable and the tension the author builds leads to a satisfying conclusion. This is vintage Christie."
4,Excellent Reference,"As an architectural book editor, I find this book an excellent reference for biographical data, architectural terms, and historical context. It's concise enough to give me just the bit of information I need when doing a fact-check or making sure a term is used properly."
4,Caesar Lives!,"This is an outstanding DVD replete with interviews with cast, writers as well as the master himself, Caesar. It effectively tells the story of the rise of one of TV's most inventive and groundbreaking shows, Your Show of Shows, and the stable of talent writing for it including Mel Brooks, Larry Gelbart, Neil Simon and some guy named Woody Allen.It also chronicles the difficulties in working with such a tempermental giant as Caesar as well as his problems with drugs and alcohol."
5,Coming of age don't come any harder,"In a time of sugary sweet coming of age stories like Juno and Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, it was a wonder to read something so simultaneously harsh and heart felt as MSFFG.I am an objective reader, and I couldn't put this book down for one second. literally read it cover to cover in one sitting.The setting of 80s suburban wasteland, the infusion of grime-core punk music and the undercutting of the John hughes genre makes this a teenage adventure I can actually relate to my own life.And it is so funny.A wonderful book I would recommend to any and every one."
1,someone shoulda put this turkey to death,"I can't believe that there are so many good reviews of this movie on Amazon. This movie absolutely stunk. You knew exactly what was going on 20 minutes into it. I kept watching, hoping that there would be some twist that would save it... but there wasn't. Believe me folks, this movie is pretty darn close to being as bad as The Postman or The Patriot. I ordinarily don't write reviews, but the reviewers so far must be related to the filmmakers or paid to say nice things or something. This movie is an insult to intelligent movie-goers. Fair warning."
2,Lacks subtlety.,"This film really isn't as clever as it would like to be. Most of the performances are disappointing and the dialogue has no subtlety which makes it almost insulting to its audience's intelligence. Plus, the multiple plot twists at the end seem unoriginal now that the trend is so overused.This film could have had some real surprises and raised some real questions. It should have been much better."
3,The Life of David Gale,"The Life of David Gale starts off a little slow, but eventually works up to a surprising conclusion. This movie was pretty good. The performances by Laura Linney and Kate Winslet were top notch. I think this movie could have been improved a little, but all around, Alan Parker did a good job with what he had. The first few twists in the movie are very predictable, but, the last one threw me. This movie is definitely not for anyone under 16. There is one strong scene of sexuality, and there are very disturbing images of a killing. All around, the Life of David Gale is worth watching."
4,Critics Miss the Point of David Gale,"I was lucky enough to be invited to an advance screenig of this film, despite the fact that I was no Kevin Spacey fan. I am a changed person. This movie is interesting and emotionally complex. Critic's reviews pan this film as an over-the-top, preachy anti-death penalty movie. It couldnt be farther from the truth. Sure, this film will get you thinking about the death penalty, but it probably won't change your mind. It is a simple thriller with a plot twist so inventive, you'll never guess whodunit! I recommend this movie."
3,Good Enough,"This movie may not have been a masterpiece but it was definately entertainining and had a cool ending. Former professor, David Gale (Kevin Spacey), is facing the death penalty for murder. After speaking with him several times, journalist Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet) is convinced that Gale is innocent, and tries to stop his execution. I don't want to give much else away because the way the story unfolds is suprising and fun. Some of the plot elements were kind of unrealistic, but this really wasn't a bad movie."
5,Should get Best Picture Oscar for 2003,"Acting is excellent, story is great and very moving. I will be very surprised if this movie is not nominated and subsequently wins the 2003 Oscar for Best Picture. It brought out a mixture of intense emotions I've never before experienced from watching a movie."
1,politically muddled flick,"Another liberal tear-jerking flick. The ""surprise"" ending is supposed to make us feel bad and finally see the light about how evil the dp is. Instead my wife and I got the feeling that maybe justice was served after all. Typically all the pro-dp characters in the movie are one-dimensional cartoons. They're all idiot bible-thumpers, including the governor who is of course a direct ripoff of George Bush. The plot is unbelievable, and when the final plot ""twist"" is revealed, I not only was glad for what happened in the movie to Spacey, I wanted to see the same justice done to the people who made this turkey. Another two plus hours of my life that I can't get back."
4,"Not perfect, but very good","I saw an advanced screening of this movie, and I really found it to be thought provoking and powerful. Spacey and Winslet gave great, believable performances. Some of the editing threw me off, which kind of detracted from the the story. I had become very interested in this story and was pulled into it, then the way in which the movie transitioned between present and past pulled me back out. In spite of that, I really enjoyed this movie.I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, so I won't give details. But my favorite part of the movie is the Govorner of Texas - a striking resemblance to GW. It was a nice touch."
5,Great Whodunit Movie,"This is a good mystery/thriller/detective movie that makes you always guessing and wondering. Don't get caught in the ""death penalty"" situation, since you may or may not agree with it. Instead, pay attention to the story, ie. what Kate Winslet found, what Kevin Spacey did, how his reaction was, etc. If you do that, you'll find yourself a great whodunit movie."
4,A Very Good Film,"I had read so many reviews saying how bad this movie was, so since I don't go by what other people think I saw it. I have to tell you that I loved it, it is one of the best movies i have seen in a long time.I think that people taht disliked the movie where people that got offended by it. There are some issues that may be sensitive to a number of people. I on the other hand didn't get offended at all. I'm not going to describe the story because I'm sure everyone knows waht it is about. All i have to say is that i highly recommned this movie to anyone with an open mind.Legend: 5 Stars: Classic; 4 Stars: Excellent; 3 Stars: Good; 2 Stars: Fair; 1 Star: Poor"
2,When bad movies happen to good actors. . .,"I was told to watch this movie by people claiming it was, ""The best ever"", ""keeps you on the edge of your seat"", ""The ending was amazing"". I disagreed with all three of those people, especially that last one!What starts off as being a highly interesting and thought provoking suspenseful drama, soon turns into predictable and preachy dreck. The ""surprise"" ending can be figured out by anyone with a couple of brain cells 45 minutes into the movie.The actors were great, but really, if you want a GOOD Alan Parker movie, skip this and rent ""Angel Heart""."
3,Movie rhythm off kilter,"I was confused by the ending.We begin with Kate Winslet and her partner flying to Texas reponding to a request for a personal interview with the condemned David Gale. As Gale tells his story, you automatically determine he's innocent; therefore, the movie becomes all about who framed him and for what reason? Can Kate Winslet get the evidence to the public in time before David Gale is executed? Finding out whodunnit is almost too easy since Gale shows no urgency in trying to escape his fate. Nonetheless, the movie throws in useless red herrings, ineffectively trying to be unpredictable and poorly meshing the suspense with the film's ""Scooby Doo"" mystery feel. This messes up the movie rhythm entirely. Part mystery, part suspense, part human interest and part politcal...too many agendas in one film.I guess I was expecting something profound and shocking like ""Silence of the Lambs"". But it was not.I'd skip it."
5,The Life of David Gale,"This movie is superb. Sure it's a movie about the death penalty, but its goal is to make us THINK, not to tell us how to. (Isn't that what the last frame is truly saying?) The acting is marvelous, the suspense is real, and the twist will blow you away. Check it out for yourself. Let the fine acting of Spacey, Winslet and Linney lure you into the theatre. In the very least, you will be rewarded with great conversation on the way home."
5,Excellent!,This is an amazing movie that everyone should see. I think those who reviewed this movie in a negative manner simply did not understand it.
1,A movie about obsessive fanatics,"I really wanted to like this movie. I like everybody in it. But in the end (without blowing the story), it was a farcical tale about a bunch of fanatics who are so obsessed with their singular ideal that when we learn the truth about what is going on, they become so completely unsympathetic to the point of being moronic.If the filmmakers were trying to make a film showing the pointlessness of being such an individual, then I would have to say, ""Job well done."""
1,On my list of the worst movies I've ever seen,"I like complex films but this was too much, too implausible, too ridiculous to be beleived. Worst of all this film was, at times, just plain sickening to watch. It took an especially twisted Hollyweird mind to come up with this garbage. Hey, no surprise."
1,Not worth it,"This movie was far too contrived and unoriginal to make it even a midly interesting viewing. Kevin Spacey was not in his top form in this movie, and combined with the horrible plotting and pacing the movie is a near-catastrophe. Unless you are a hardcore Spacey or Winslet fan, I would avoid viewing this film."
3,mixed message of dubious value,"The intensity level of this movie is incredibly high, there's no question, but what is the director trying to say? Unlike, say Dead Man Walking or Dancer in the Dark, the message isn't crystal clear, it's quite muddied by the plot, which is in a way good because you do get a plot-driven movie, somewhat of a murder mystery with a message, instead of a preachy piece of work. The performances were mediocre with the exception of Laura Linney, and the story itself lacked focus. The ""twist ending"" ala Primal Fear and Usual Suspects lacked punch. It was just muddled and befuddled amperage."
4,Good Movie,"Watched this one tonight for New Year's Eve and thought that this film was pretty good...in the beginning it does drag just a bit...but it quickly takes off with some twists and turns that you would not believe.A man is on death row for the murder of a woman, found dead on her living room floor, with her hands handcuff behind her back, a duct taped mouth and a plastic bag over her head that is duct taped around her throat. It is all signs of the perfect murder...but is it....watch this film and find out for yourself!!"
1,stupid movie,Some idiot sets himself up so that he has to get executed in order to convince society that it's wrong to execute him. This would make a pretty good Three Stooges plot; Larry and Curley set up Moe so he has to slap them so he can see how unjust it is to slap them.The statistical fact is that capital punishment is 100% successful as a deterrent to murder; every murderer who's ever received capital punishment has never murdered again.
2,a dichotomy,"This movie was disturbing for all the wrong reasons. First, the acting ranged from superb (Spacey) to very good (Linney) to chew the scenery big-time (Kate). The direction was great, and so was the screenplay. The movie, however, wasn't enjoyable at all. It was simply cheap exploitation. Worth watching (rent it),but only with a hand firmly on the FF button"
4,"NOT AN EPIC, BUT A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE..","This isn't one of the great movies of all time, but it certainly isn't the horribly bad movie that I imagined after reading the reviews on this site.It is a sly take on capital punishment, as you probably know already. It will hold your interest right through to its twisted end, which is what entertainment is about, isn't it?Having said that, I did find the characters a little cliched --(1) the alcoholic and dissolute but brilliant professor(2) the emotional and crusading activist(3) the plucky and assertive reporter(4) the good-old-boy country lawyer(5) the well-groomed but brainless governorThe movie has its moments, and although the ""big explosive ending"" was not exactly opaque to me, it does make you think. What ""Dead Man Walking"" accomplished at an emotional level, ""The Life of David Gale"" accomplishes in its message and plot.Definitely worth a watch!"
3,Something Was Missing,"I don't know quite how to put it. The Life of David Gale is certainly a message film sprinkled with suspense, but the ending left me bewildered. Why did the murder suspect mail Bitsey a second tape that showed David Gale involved with the suicide? Other questions I raise are: What motive did Berlin have for charging Gale with rape? Why did Gale's wife and son flee to Italy or was it Spain? Is Gale's situation so hopeless that he decides to die for the cause? Gale and the murder suspect didn't seem to have a strong bond of friendship, yet what would compel the murder suspect to travel to Europe with a suitcase of money and make sure that Gale's wife receives it? Does anyone have any answers? The film is complex with its layers of left wing politics, morality plays, and Hitchcockian twists, but still comes up short. A classic film that contrasts innocence with guilt without the death penalty issue is The Wrong Man starring Henry Fonda."
5,One of Catherine Wheel's best,"If you're a fan of shoegazer rock, you have to own Chrome by the Catherine Wheel. The wall of sound that the band is famous for is present on each and every track. Layers of guitars and dreamy vocals saturate the third cut ""Crank"", while heavy distorted guitars accent songs like ""Chrome"" and ""Kill Rhythm"". If you like bands like My Bloody Valentine, Adorable, and Pink Floyd - you'll love this album. It's one of my all-time favourites."
4,Pretty good stuff...,"I bought a couple of Catherine Wheel recordings based on a recommendation from a friend. I like this band, but then again I like smelling my dog's feet. (Q - Did you ever notice that dog's feet tend to smell a lot like Fritos? No kidding - go check it out right now!)So, ahem... Catherine Wheel. Very good band, good song-writing, good vocals and musicianship throughout. I am fairly well impressed with these guys. I personally prefer a bit more lead guitar / improvisation, but these guys make up for it with other content. Well composed music, all played with energy that some bands miss. Give it a try - Adam and Eve is also a good album from them."
4,This was my introduction...,"I was a music director at a college radio station when this came out, and along with a ton of other albums this one commanded my attention.Shoegazers??? I am sure all the label slinging yahoos are still wiping the egg off their faces. Its as if the band heard they were pigeonholed and gave them all the big finger.Just buy it...and all the rest."
5,Broken Head,"I've purchased this album three times, lost it three times, and am about to purchase it again. It's that good. I've got 40 GB of music on my ipod and there's a gaping hole without Broken Head, The Nude, etc. Incredible. If you've come this far to read a review, you owe it to yourself and friends to pick this up."
2,Cannot Support The Impulse,"I heard the music of Catherine Wheel on an alternative radio station and liked it. But when I learned what a ""Catherine Wheel"" is, I discontinued listening and will not further listen. I cannot abide the idea that a musical band would name themselves after among the most hideous instruments of public torture and death in human history.Think about it -- somebody had to formulate the name and decide that of a billion choices of word pairings connoting ideas, this was the one they wanted on their masthead. I won't listen to their music, anymore than I would listen to death metal. At some point we have to see the big picture in these things."
1,Misleading title,"This article does not include a ""normal versus high-calorie menu). This is a complete fabrication and to steal any money from me is wrong!"
3,still pretty good but get the 2 previous first.....,l like tiger army...the way there stand up base produces a nice little clicking sound is great....the song writing and sound is very punk rockish and yet very inique which can be a problem in punk rock when everything starts to blend together....i still think this album is pretty good but i would recomend the two previous above it....
2,nick 13 needs a new formula!!!,"heres my feelings about tiger army. first album rocks,2nd album song structures-lyrics-and music getting repetitive plus the addition of mister 13's new davey havock voice plus plus the addition of said moron himself,and this their third album besides 2 or 3 songs royaly sucks psycho dung. nick 13 doesn't dare call this 'band' ""psychobilly"" does he? cause tiger army has morphed into a watered down version of it's former self. another intro(yawn),more ballads about lost love(double yawn) and yes more self indulgent crap about tiger army never dying. please die....please? the addition of some of the worlds most boring drumming doesnt help. anyway's, stay clear of this homogenized commercial sounding hellcat records garbage. if you wanna' hear tiger army rock buy the first album or the early years e.p. besides that it'sboring."
3,The Gist on: Tiger Army III,"If your AFI CD's have set up a permenant residence in your player, you can take them out and get the same kind of sound. Of course, no band is the same and that is what's great. Without having the same sound, Tiger Army's got the same sound, savvy? Emotion without screams and chaotic bits thrown in without guitar crunches set them aside.I only gave it a three for a lack of variety. It's good, but lacks the diversity and changing paces of tracks that could make it a stand-out album; but the static sound actually works quite well for Tiger Army. Simply put, you should get it if you feel AFI has made your other Cd's their bitches."
5,Tiger Army,"Upon first listen to this cd I was a little disappointed. The songs are alot more mellow than the ones from previous releases. But on a second listen I realized that this is probably alot better than their previous relases. The lyrics, singing, and muscianship is alot stronger. With songs like Rose Of The Devil's Garden and The Long Road one can hear jsut how great Tiger Army is becoming. The way I can compare this cd to anybody who has never listened to Tiger Army is its a mix between early AFI vocals a bit of Living End music and his of Johnny Cash lyrics. Amazing and breathtaking all in one."
4,Book review,"A well-written step-by-step guide for refitting a sailing vessel. The photographs were excellent. Mr Naujok included many helpful hints on projects. I had hoped for more detailed instruction on redoing headliner and ideas for modernizing an old interior than what was covered in this book. However, it is a valuable reference book for do-it-yourselfers."
3,"Veddy British, Ol Chap!","It's OK but written by a european in British english. I was constantly having to translate British terms into our U S common terminology in my head. I found it interesting, certainly not a pricey book but probably would not have purchased had I realized that it was written with the Brit in mind. Two nations separated by a common language and all that."
2,Nothing more than I know before,Absolutely basic information about boat interior.Good for beginers.Information about table chart and equipments are very old. We have XXI st century
1,Case studies packed in with bs,"This book was terrible. The writer presented several interesting case studies of good companies doing bad things, and even of good companies doing good things, which was a well written 30 or so pages. The rest of the book was just nonsense or obvious ideals thrown in there so that the author would be able to sell the book instead of making it a smaller article."
4,A must read for CEOs,"The issues tackled are stuff companies might usually ignore. But unless companies do anything do about these things, who else could make a difference in this world?"
5,solid quality,"I was expecting a half-baked POS, and I got something I think will last for a really long time.Handle is aluminum, has two sections, seems sturdy. Scoop is decent plastic, better than the cheap snow shovel I had been using. Collapses down to the size of the scoop, and extended it looks as it does in the pic. FYI, it is kinda short for a snow shovel, but that's the point. It fits in your trunk v. well."
5,It was so good...we named it.,"I am so glad I purchased this shovel! I live in an area that does not get much snow, so I wanted a shovel that did not take up much space in my trunk thinking that I probably wouldn't need it for maybe even a few years. Then came the Snowpocalypse of 2010. This shovel was perfect. It was strong enough to manage as much snow as you can fit on it. Please check the size of the scoop before you purchase though. If you are looking for a big shovel, this is not it. However, I live in a condo building with a large parking lot. This shovel's small size actually made it easier to dig out around my car and especially under it and around the wheels. There is no way I would have been able to dig around the wheels the way I did with a bigger shovel.""Shovely"" will be a member of my family for a long time."
3,"Finally got it, works well enough.","I ordered this like a week ago. Ordered two items that day, actually. First one from a different vendor - different item - arrived today. This thing has yet to ship! What gives? By the time it gets here winter will be OVER!!! GET A MOVE ON. Once I get this, then maybe I'll review it for you.** UPDATE:Status: In transitABOUT TIME!** UPDATE 2:Finally got it! Took WEEKS to ship out! But, it seems nice enough. Smaller than you'd expect, but fine for the trunk of your car. No problem putting it together and I would recommend it for light snow or emergencies."
3,new pricing misleading,"The Ames snow shovel was sold by Amazon for about $19. I wanted to purchase it and found that it is now available through Amazon only from another seller. The price listed is $154.99 !!!! It turns out that the new price is for a dozen of these shovels, but Amazon has not put that information on the site. My star rating is random. I haven't been able to purchase the product in order to rate it. I only want ONE!!!UPDATE --- I now own this shovel. It gets high points for being convenient, but loses points for being weak and unworthy. It would be great to have in the car for the occasional times when a few inches of snow fell while you were inside enjoying your Starbucks, but terrible for digging a path through a couple of feet to get to your front door after a storm. It is definitely (as advertised) an ""emergency"" shovel. Expect to break it if the emergency is significant. The shovel --- especially the collapsible handle --- is rather flimsy."
2,Vest for Giants!,"The mailing was actually slow, but not too bad. The item, a men's large down vest was H-U-G-E ! I bought it for my son who is 6'2' and 190 lbs. It came nearly to his knees. Then, I returned it. Twice the seller sent me someone else's e-mail message regarding the $90 credit to my charge, but I had requested a check which WAS an option. They said I had to get a charge account credit.Then they gave me only a $6 refund!After I got that straightened out, they did allot me the $90 I spent on it, but I still have not seen the refund on my charge. Did they send it to that other e-mail address? Another problem."
3,"Same as King Biscuit ""At the Royal Albert Hall Part 1""","This is a Dutch reissue of Part 1 of the King Biscuit Flower Hour release of the 1977 live recording ""At the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra."" Sound quality appears to be similar, but the songs are out of order and some of the banter between the songs is cut. If you want the entire concert in the correct order, get the two King Biscuit releases."
3,Not much new information,"Although the reading was easy and interesting there was not much new information to learn. Also, it seemed as though the author needed pages of quoted information from others just to fill up the book time after time again. I would recommend checking the book out of the library rather than buying it."
3,Journalistic mishmash,"While this book does contain some new and interesting information; on the whole it clearly is not historiography in any normal sense of the term. The book reads like a series of newspaper columns untouched by editing or a thematic approach.The author does however, as they say in the tabloids, 'name names' (whether or not the average reader knows who they are.)As a piece of gossip and current events it bears reading; but a reader looking for serious scholarship or even decent biography should wait for the paperback edition."
1,Pro-Charles Book,"I tried reading this yesterday as soon as I got it, but after the first three chapters, I had to put it down.I enjoy biographies that tell both the postive and negative side of a person or insitution; this book mostly promotes the positive side of Prince Charles, and doesn't really tell of his negative side."
2,Yawn,"I love things about the royal family. But this book put me to sleep faster than a double dose of Ambian.Penny is a Prince Of Wales fan, through and through. And she quite likes Camilla. This felt like reading a book written by the Prince's PR machine.The most disappointing book about the Windsors ever. Too much minutia and not enough substance. I agree, check it out of the library! Caution. DO NOT BUY!"
1,worthless,"This study guide really upset me. It just a bunch of questions, but without answer. What good does a study guide do when there is just question but no answer. If you wonder why I bought the book is that because this book bundle with the textbook, it is the package I bought, and non-refunable once you unwrapped the book. The text is an excellent book. If there is anything lower than a 1 star, I will give it to this book."
3,Haciendo una síntesis,"Haciendo una síntesis de las opiniones vertidas anteriormente (y que comparto, por igual) diría que es un disco fantástico....si eres capaz de concentrarte en la música a pesar de esos horribles gruñidos.Entiendo que esos chillidos forman parte de la técnica de Jarret para concentrarse durante una interpretación, pero, ¿no podrían eliminarse o reducirse al mínimo con las técnicas de estudio?."
4,More Monster Than Human...,"Bela Lugosi is perfectly eeevil as Dr. Orloff, part-time insurance salesman / full-time con-man and murderer! Orloff has been setting people up w/ fat life insurance policies, only to kill the poor suckers after making himself their sole beneficiary! With the help of his blind, giant henchman, Jake, Orloff has been busily dumping his victims into the Thames! Orloff's utter contempt for the human race is very convincing! Will he be stopped before more people perish?? Scotland Yard is on the case! HUMAN MONSTER is one of Bela's best movies, along w/ WHITE ZOMBIE, DRACULA, THE BLACK CAT, THE RAVEN, and MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE. Belongs on every horror shelf..."
3,15 bela lugosi films,"not bad. started from the end and have been watching backwards in years. some films seem like they have been edited but we're thinking it is just because they are so old. Oldest ones, Bela is a ""good guy"". Strange. Some are boring. most are good. not one of the best bunches of films but glad to have it to add to library."
2,Mediocre Lugosi Box Set to trick the casual horror buff,"I was one of the many Classic Horror fans that got tricked into buying this neat,LOOKING set of classic Lugosi films.Typical of this companies releases,the quality varies from decent to terrible.And EVERY film has to have the company's logo at the bottom,so no one can bootleg there public domain prints.....gee,thanks!The set could impress by rarer titles,but since many ARE available on other labels for cheaper prices(and better quality)it's not really worth it.The Midnight Girl(1925) is the only rarity,everything else has been released on other sets and sold seperately.The bonus is a documentary on Lugosi from the ""100 Years of Horror"" Box set,but honestly,i'd reccomend that you'd just buy that set.Not a great set,seek out a MillCreek set if you want Lugosi on the cheap."
1,Unwatchable,"Excellent low budget Lugosi film, but the Alpha version is terrible. Like a 25 year old VHS, the image changes from light to very dark constantly and the soundtrack is muffled throughout. Look for a copy of the Roan double feature (w/Mystery Liner) or the Diamond double feature (w/The Ape Man). Both are much better prints. This is a total waste. Cover sure looks nice, though."
5,Ed McBain's Mystery Magazine,This item arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner. It was exactly as descrtibed. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
3,Missing In Action 2 + 3 Good value for monney,Great to see these movies cloud not get a better deal they are not available where I live so was pleased to get them.This just what I expected a better definition of picture and sound quality than the last time I saw these movies which were on VHS.The seller was prompt as could possibly had been with delivery.
5,CHUCK IS BACK!!!!,"Get ready for the ride of your life in this awesome take no prisoners, balls to the wall,bone crunching, action packed thriller. Chuck Norris stars as Colonel Braddock, a man who knows how to kick [booty]. Chuck norris never fails to amaze me with his brilliant acting, and his abilitly to whoop some [booty]. The man is a genius, he can wipe out a whole town with a couple gernade, the man is a god. I lost count on how many times a gasped in amazement due to the artistry of Chuck. It is a sad world we live in , when ones talent is not recognized....WHERE'S THE ACADEMY AWARD???? This movie is the greatest movie ever!!!!"
1,"twice the cheese on one disc, or two bombs for one","these two movies are chuck at his worst! not once in these two movies is there and dose of humor or anything that passes for the laws of nature. and while i do like mr.norris and his movies these two are not even worth his or our time. between the first three chuck has saved his men,himself,and his son,so if they do anymore i guess he'll be going back to get his comb he droped in the bush!!SKIP IT!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Chuck Norris --- One-Man Wrecking Crew,Classic battle of good (Norris) vs. evil (Viet Cong/North Vietnamese). Evil is no match for Mr. Norris. You've got to love it when Colonel Braddock (Norris) goes to work on the bad guys.
5,"A book for adults, politicians, analysts.","This is not a book for children. Rather it is a recollection of images and perceptions of the adult/child who survived the camps of World War Two to tell the tale. Cordelia Edvardson is a humanist who wants the world to abolish all that is inhumane most especially when it comes to children. She knows what its like to be taunted, terrified and have a tortured soul. A must for every policy maker, teacher, and whoever still believes in preserving a sane world.glenys sugarman"
3,Seems coming apart,"I have owned these for about 6 months. They were larger then they should have been when new, especially the waist height, but it has shrunk over several washings. The seems are starting to split now. I would buy them again for the bargain price of 19.99 I got them at, but if they are much more then that I would suggest looking for better quality elsewhere."
1,Far too big...,"I ordered these hoping that I'd have some great new silk pajamas to replace mine that had worn out. Let me tell you, if you're a small person like I am these are not at all for you. You will be completely drowning in them. I looked like I was 5 years old and playing dress up in my mother's clothing; the small is not at all small... I was highly disappointed."
3,A avrege love story,it was just a ok movie I dint think it was anything special. I have seen lots of movies were people hate egather then become friends then love egather. And I have seen better.
2,real mature.,This dvd worked great!....but only in my computer. It will not play in a dvd player. This would have been nice to have known ahead of time. My intentions with this purchase was to purchase a dvd that plays in a DVD PLAYER. real mature.
3,Not something to own,"This is one of those movies that you want to rent and see it once and feel good afterwards. I regret that I bought it and am now stuck with it. By all means, see it but don't spend your money to own it.Billy Crystal can't act. And the fact that the movie is aging quickly--the hair style, clothes, cars, etc--takes a lot out of it."
4,One of the better romantic comedy,Sure it follows the cliche romantic comedy routine but the charecters are so lovable and real and it is almost like you are taking a life journey with them i laughed higly reccomend this
3,good movie,"This movie is good, but having watched it again recently, I was a little surprised by some of the language. It's not really bad, but I could've done without it. Not a kids movie."
5,great movie--wonderful blu ray,"`i love how they improved the quality for this blu ray. i adore this movie--one of those classic films i could watch over and over again. when i bought this movie, it was around 3 bucks. 3 bucks for a blu ray--deal!"
4,Movie,"Great movie. A story that explains how two people met. Cute love story. It is like how opposites attract, and they do not like each other at first but keep bumping into one another then become like friends."
5,Another one of my all time favorites,"There's very little I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said. I didn't get to see this movie until it had been out about a decade (which is good- I don't think an 11 year old should watch this movie!). So all I knew about this movie was the infamous sceen in the cafe. But there's so much more to this movie than just that one sceen. I just love how funny this movie is and how much chemistry there is between the actors. Billy Crystal is a genius. Did you know that during the sceen where they're in the museum and he keeps going on about paprikash, that's all ad lib? It's such a cute sceen! I also like the sceen where they're in Sharper Image singing ""Surry With a Fringe on Top."" I don't know why- they're just so funny and spontaneous and seem so real!If you're one of the few who still hasn't watched this movie, do it!"
2,They've ruined this movie,"This movie has been among my favorites since I first watched it as a kid. The dialogue, pacing, humor, and music has made it a complete package for me. Unfortunately, the remastered version now has new music playing during familiar and popular scenes, causing the tone and mood to be thrown off balance with the rest of the movie. I wish I had known about the new soundtrack before I purchased this edition. While it might work for those just discovering this movie, it falls flat for this fan."
5,When Harry Met Sally,"This is exactly what I wanted; a gift for my friend The turnaround was quite fast, just in time for her birthday. Thank you!"
4,"Good romantic comedy, but it's not the best one out there.","Although both Crystal and Ryan becomes a little overbearing at times, they're tolerable throughout the movie... The chemistry between them isn't the same as say... Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, but nonetheless, it's still good and passable on-screen.The story somewhat bothered me in the sense that the ""romantic dialogue"" between the two was predictable and cheesed up. But still, it's not supposed to be American Beauty or anything, so it doesn't get to me too much.If you want a good romantic comedy, try picking up ""You've Got Mail,"" which is also written/directed by Nora Ephron. She also did Sleepless in Seattle in case you were wondering."
5,Still the greatest love story,"One of the finest love stories I have seen to this day. I was never a big fan of love stories but this movie changed that. My wife and i saw it in theatres when it came out in 1989. We got it on VHS and now on dvd. We still enjoy it and watch it every couple of years around the Christmas/New Years/Holiday season. This is a fantastic movie, a true classic, a timeless classic."
3,Good movie,"An easy-going, laid back film to enjoy by the late Nora Ephron. It follows suit with Nora's other films and books...i.e."
5,Classic boy meets girl,Such a gem this movie is - love Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan together - Rob Reiner had it together on this one!
5,Romantic Comedy,"A great date movie. A humorous and delightfully honest movie about relationships. Wonderful movie. Memorable dialogue. Billy Crystal is funny and Meg Ryan, in an early role, absolutely glows."
2,DVD is MISSING IMPORTANT SCENES,"This DVD is missing Importnat Scenes. One is the Musuem Visit Scene and his Apartment scene, another is the Harry Connick Piano scene at the end of the movie.Who is this John Arceri etc? I wanted the Original Version and this is not it."
4,Thoughts on You've Got Mail,"I totally enjoyed this movie, Billy Crystal Is as always a great watch, plus Meg Ryan is unbeatable. When I see a movie like this I get to believing the actors are really like this in real life. I watch movies to be entertained, this movie entertained me. I liked this more than Sleepless in Seattle, mostly because Meg Ryan was in it more."
4,Cute,"I'm a 31 year old female and I just sat down and watched this the other night after I finally decided I should see it since I hear about certain scenes in it often. I'm glad I got this. It's a pretty cute romantic comedy and Billy Crystal did a great job in this movie. For 3.99, it's definitely worth a spot on my shelf with my many other movies!"
5,Love this movie,"This is one of my favorite movies ever. I'm no expert on how well a film transfers to Blu-Ray, but having owned a VHS copy of this movie I can tell you it looks quite nice on Blu-Ray."
1,Classic Comedy Should read 5 Star rating,"It should be noted, that throughout the film, Meg Ryan gives an Academy Award caliber performance,(surprisingly overlooked by the Academy) and Billy Crystal's masterful comic timing, is as adroit as ever."
1,Yawwwwwn,"I am probably not the person to review this movie. I think Billy Crystal has about as much acting talent as a ball of lint. No human male actually acts like that, but, hey, it's only a movie. A ""chick"" movie! I did not laugh once. This was supposed to be a comedic love story, wasn't it? Well, it wasn't. If you are female, you will love this flick. If not, find an excuse, any excuse, not to see this movie."
1,a contrived cliche,"yuck. i really hate this film. first of all, it's as if ANNIE HALL was remade as a television sitcom. ANNIE HALL is a much better movie! It's a classic. This one is hopelessly mediocre and it dates really badly. The second reason I hate this film is how it engages in all this ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Uranus"" nonsense. The gender roles are so boring - the man who is dark and cynical (his name is BURNS - how profound! and obvious too!) and the woman who is bright and cheery (and whoa what a surprise - her name is Albright!) Relationships are complicated. They don't work this way. This is hollywood fantasy at its worst. It's dangerous because it dupes people into believing that their lives will end up like the ones they see on screen when the sad fact of the matter is - most marriages end in divorce and there is no such thing as happily ever after.do i sound cynical? i'm really not. and before anyone accuses me of anything, i've been happily married for ten years. so there."
3,"Ok, I know this is being picky but....","I liked this movie but I still can't get out of my head the fact that Billy Crystal is about 15 years older than Meg Ryan! And though it's not like as if people with those age differences don't, or shouldn't, date in real life, I think they should have had Harry be, say a graduate student at the beginning of this movie while Sally was an undergraduate, perhaps?It seemed as if Harry was supposed to be the same age as Sally, and I like Billy Crystal ok, but he did NOT look 22- 23 years old at all!"
5,Sweet!,I really love this movie. It is unlike any other romantic comedy I have ever seen. It totally stands on its own. I thought it was so creative how about every 20 minutes they show clips of old couples telling how they were meant for each other. That was really cute. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are absoulutely perfect and have excellent chemestry. It is also really funny. I recommend this movie to everyone!
5,I challenge you to watch this movie and NOT quote it!!,"A thoroughly enjoyable look at friendship, love and the miles in between. Meg Ryan is wonderful as the uptight, neurotic woman whose relationship with the cynical, flip Billy Crystal begins with a cross-country ride.The diner scene is a classic!!"
5,Great flick for New Years!,"It's a tradition for us to watch When Harry Met Sally every year for New Years! We never get tired of it and we've memorized all the lines! Great cast, good chemistry."
5,Perfect Movie for New Tear's Eve,I have seen this movie countless times and it never fails to make me happy. Our family can quote numerous lines to each other.
2,Horrible repackaging of an already released product. Skip It!,"This is nothing more than the original release of the DVD of the classic film repackaged to include a compilation of music from the decade in which it was released. The worst thing is that none of the music on the CD has anything to do with the movie itself. I'm not even sure that any of the songs were released around the time that the movie was in theaters. Had it been the actual soundtrack of the film included we might've had something to get mildly excited over. There's also a 'time capsule' booklet with events that happened during the 80's. There are much better ways of learning 80's history than with a 16 page leaflet.Skip this product entirely, and instead try the 'Collector's Edition.' It is far superior with remastered 5.1 audio sound, exceptional audio commentary and a number of featurettes on the making of the film. The only thing better would be to see a remastered version on Blu-Ray (hint, hint Sony!)."
5,A Classic and a Great DVD,"If you haven't seen ""When Harry Met Sally,"" well then of course you must rent or buy this DVD. It is the one ""date"" movie that both genders can appreciate. It poses a critical questions: can men and women just be friends? It has beautiful, lush NYC settings in the late 1970's and 1980's. Plus, Nora Ephron wrote a witty, wonderful script. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan delivered her lines with panache.If you have seen ""When Harry Met Sally,"" even if you own the VHS tape, you still should buy or rent the DVD. Rob Reiner's commentary over the film is wonderful. At the time of the shooting of the film, he had been dating and had not yet met the perfect woman. He actually met her during the shooting of the film-in fact, he points out the scene that was shot on the day he met her-and this adds a personal note to a great classic."
5,men and women CAN BE friends ;),since the 80`s this has been one of my all-time favorite movies because meg ryan & billy crystal really do a great job with the drama and with the comedy. it was nice to see their relationship grow and change through the years.
4,"Great Knight, fun horse, poor combination","The Omega male is a great addition to the Stikfa line. His bulk is intimidating, and he has great accessories in his armor and weapons. His horse is a great twist of the Stikfa theme and is also fun to play with. But sadly, having the knight ride his mount reveals their limitations. Although Stikfas are amazingly poseable, these toys suddenly become very clumsy as you struggle to pose them together. A real shame."
1,NOT FUN IF IT FALLS APART!,"i got this for all the little boys i know who are hero crazy for christmas. first, the instructions on putting this together are muddled, at best. second, there are sharp edges where the pieces were attached to the frame - ouch!! third, the darn thing won't stay together so they can play w/ it! great idea, bad execution. i vote NO on this toy."
2,Not vinyl,"I wanted a vinyl and was thrilled at how cheap I would be able to get it for, but alas I was sent a CD copy. My money was refunded and I was given the cd as well... but I still just wanted the vinyl."
2,Not Salsa,"It has the consistency and taste of a pizza sauce or tomato paste. It doesn't have many chunks in it at all and ""Chunky"" is in the title."
5,Fun video,The Land Before Time - Journey to Big WaterIt completed my Land Before Time VHS collection. Thanks so much.
3,only if you're a collector,I have seen almost all of the land before times and this is my least favorite. it not as long as most of the other and there is not as much adventure. my kid got bored with it.
3,"Pattern to these movies, kinda annoying","I bought this movie because my son has become obsessed with Land before Time. I got tired of watching the same 2 over and over again so I ordered about 5 different ones.Well in this one there is flood which brings in some new creatures from the Big Water that the valley has never seen before. They meet a new friend Mo who like a colorful dolphin? I find him and his voice extremely annoying, does my son no, but boy do I! Of corse Little Foot wants to help his friend back to big water, but the adults say no. So they go off to see Mo and their is an earthquake. So in this one they actually have no choice to but to find a way around the land break to get back to their families. On the way they take Mo back to big water and meet an under water sharp teeth. So the only thing I like about this one is that they technically did not run off from their parents like in ALOT of the other movies!! But I just find the fish annoying."
3,Not too bad of an episode By The Z,"This episode was mildly amusing. Every episode has its ups like Thomas Dekker continuing to play Littlefoot. The songs weren't incredibly boring like ""Imaginary Friends"" song, imaginary friends aren't really cool freidns because you just get made fun of if the secret slips out. ""Chanson D' Ennui"" also known as the Boring Song in french. Littlefoot and the gang are bored out of their minds and this song didn't really help at all. But the best was once again saved for last ""No one has to be alone"" was the best. Even though it was a spoff off of Donny Osmond. The only down part was Mo. His pranks were no were near funny and I'm glad he left. Lets hope he doesn't come back."
2,I don't like it; my four-year-old does.,"I've enjoyed the eight previous Land Before Time adventures, but not this one. Rent it before you buy it. I'm glad I did. I feel the animation and dialogue are not as good as others, the voices are different and more irritating, and Cera is more negative than usual. I realize that this review is also negative and may not get many helpful votes from readers...but really, I'm not criticizing just to criticize. Rent before you buy."
5,The Land Before Time-Journey to Bg Water,Received our Land Before Time - Journey to big Water Today and item arrived in condition described and in a timely manner.
1,Zero!,"Sorry but ever since the 7th one was made the company made pretty bad sequils, I once the 12th one aproves the whole series. I just think they need new writers on the set, I have some pretty good ideas........"
3,Good movie but nothing special.,"I like all of Stephen King's novels and movies. I like this movie but it is not one of the better ones, still I don't think this movie is a waste of money. If you like Stephen King this movie will still be a good one to add to the collection, because the idea is still original and typical Stephen King."
2,Bad...just bad,I bought this for a friend and watched it with him. I knew it would be bad and it was. I guess if you like this kind of thing then it would be good for you. I on the other hand have taste.
2,Not exactly a King epic:,"Bad special effects, a completely wooden plot nailed to cardboard characters, bad acting and cheesy gore effects do not compliment would could have been a very scary movie. Inexplicably incestious Cat people live like cia undercover agents in a small town, and stake out victims to gain energy. There is no explanation as to what these creatures are, and basically the whole thing is a solid vehicle for a bunch of scenes involving painfully conspicious latex prop limbs being torn and split while the creatures feed off of the energy of fresh victims (one scene where a man has his hand cut off actually rivals luke skywalker's incredibly unconvincing appendage loss in ""The Empire Strikes Back). The cat people themselves are reminiscent of japanese rubber suit monsters (one almost expects power rangers to jump out) and the morphing special effects look ridiculous. Entertaining enough to warrant watching the whole thing ... even If not for any reason it intended to be."
2,They are so F *@#ng ugly !,"Well the it starts out pretty good. the plot is alright, the actors are pretty good and the special effects are amazing for when it was done. Then in the end it all gets wacky... almost like a comedy. One scene when the seriously dissturbed mom (Alice Krige) kills a guy whit a corncob! But when it really gets bad is in the end when you see how the ""sleepwalkers really look..."
1,blue ray not working,hi there the blue ray is not working can u sed we a naer one all my money back thanks.
1,0 STARS: What's that awful smell coming from my DVD player?,"Ah, yes, that would be Stephen King's ""Sleepwalkers"". Wow, this movie is GARBAGE and it sure stinks like a sewer. This movie is about as scary as Mary Poppins and is almost as stupid as the horrendous ""American Werewolf in Paris""!! The plot is pathetic (I will not rehash this disgrace of a plot) and so are these so called ""sleepwalkers"".The acting is horrible and the directing is atrocious. I have thrown this DVD in the garbage where it belongs...I do not even have the heart to sell this trash to anybody. All I have to say is good riddance to some very bad rubbish."
3,"not to be catty, but","This isn't a very good movie. The gore effects are not great, there are plot holes big enough to drive a Trans-Am through, and most of the acting is board stiff. The only bright spot is Alice Krige- she turns in one of her usual, ..performances. Why this woman is not the biggest star on the planet, I'll never know. She made this character, Eva in ""Ghost Story"", and the Borg Queen in the Star Trek movie so incredibly ..compelling I can't think why she doesn't get bigger jobs. Worth seeing only for her."
4,Pretty good for an older Stephen King Flick,"I thought this movie was pretty good, but mostly because they kept playing Sleepwalk by Santo & Jonny. Decent action, cameos by King, Clive Barker and Mark Hammil (the cop at the beginning). Always fun to look at Madchen Amick."
3,Comic-Horror,"Sleepwalkers isn't one of SK's best movies, but it is entertaining. More humor than horror, still it has its moments.For SK fans, it's worth watching. Whether you give one or five stars after viewing.The reason/s I gave Sleepwalkers 3 Stars is, there are way too many unanswered questions. How and where did Cat-People originate? Were there others? Why did mom and son sleep together? Many, many more including, if they depended on virgins to survive, wouldn't they have been extinct long ago??? lol.Next, I bought this movie on VHS. If the DVD included Special Features, I'd consider purchasing. Apparently, it doesn't have extras, so I'll stick with my VHS."
1,???,"No la vi y no tengo nada para decir. La recibi en tiempo y forma. Y nada mas para decir. Si alguien la vio y tine ganas de contarmela, aguardo los comentarios. No ttengo intenciòn de verla por el momento"
4,King Collection,"Ok, we all know dvd is quickly going he way of VHS and if you are like me you kick yourself every time you waste your money buying a ""has been"" format, however, until this one is transferred to BluRay we gotta buy the dvd because we just got to have all the Stephen King movies..haha"
2,I think this movie is just sick,"It's terrible! About the only thing it had going for it were the special effects and the musical score. Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King, and I love scary movies, but this one is just plain sick."
1,didn't feel like a Stephen King movie,"I've seen some really good movies from Stephen King, but Sleepwalkers was just bad. The movie has some funny scenes and an eerie musical score, but that's it. I guess I know why Stephen King didn't write Sleepwalkers as a book first."
2,"Stop the deluge; I've had enough!,'","This CD just about drove me nuts. I understand that rain is to be expected in a rainforest,but after listening to this recording my pets were lining up two-by-two. This CD is for you if you love a long rain and dripping sounds. I hated it; it was monotonous and I could swear that there were portions that were repeated because the person recording it had to fill up some space and nothing was available.Save your money!"
3,It grew on me,"At first listening, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. There is a lot of stuff going on including an occasional shrieking monkey. I could not listen to this CD for general relaxing or background music. Out of desperation, because a thunderstorm CD died, we popped this one in to fall asleep to, and it's now a favorite, for that purpose. Perhaps it's just because we live near the LA harbor, like to sleep with the windows open and this sufficiently drowns out the noise. It works and is favored. It also seemed to increase the bird population in the area."
4,Four Things... Is A-W-E-S-O-M-E!,I recently read this book and I LOVED it. The only problems were 1. I couldn't put it down so I was done with it pretty quickly. 2. It had a cliffhanger ending. I think that Jane Harrington should DEFINATLY write a sequel. Girls every where should read Four Things My Geeky Jock Of A Best Friend Must Do In Europe!
5,funny....,this book is so funny and cute! the funniest part was when i was reading this book we were talking about europe in s.s. and like every other class so that was funny!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A serious examination of the mythic & historical Jesus,"The author, Robert Graves, is preeminent authority on myths & mythic patterns. He has applied years of scholarship and his own indisputable brilliance to the subject of Jesus. A serious treatise on the subject."
3,His weakest effort,"The book has some interesting ideas. There are several problems however:1) Most of the writings from ancient times have been lost, so he bases his theories on what has survived, which is very incomplete.2) He too heavily pushed his white goddess theory3) His command of Hebrew seems to be limited. For instance he writes Son of Adam. This is the literal translation of Ben Adam which means person. No one really means it as son of adam."
4,Hmmm...,"I agree that I, Claudius and Claudius the God are far better reads as far as entertainment value. But my reaction to King Jesus was, ""You know...It COULD have happened that way."" In childhood I was the kid that made the teachers raise their eyebrows with my questions (and probably consign me to Satan's realm when my time comes), but it's always bothered me that the only species I've ever heard of being capable of parthenogenesis was--turkeys."
4,Jesus H. Christ,"Graves is an extremely insightful and vivid writer. This was an extremely provacative and original piece of work when it was published. I would highly recomment this to people who are inquisitive about the life of Jesus in bit of a different context. This book is a must read for all athiests and agnostics as is posits an interesting explantion for Jesus in a historical context. It is dense reading, but worth it nonetheless."
2,Hard Read,"This book is not an easy read; to many diversions within the story to get excited about the character. It hurt my ""head"" to try and stay with it. I enjoy reading, but this book takes the joy out of reading! It has taken me months to get to the 6th chapter"
1,"CATFOOD LABELED ""PRIME TUNA""","Yet another comedic attempt to create a politically popular view of an historic period about which much is known.Perfect vehicle to ""slop"" the masses."
1,A Blasphemous Misrepresentation of Truth and History,"There is very little that is truthful, historical, or virtuous about this book. Robert Graves was a Liberal and Atheistic classicist who wanted to give his own perverse, ungodly, and blasphemous misrepresentation of the life of Jesus Christ. This work is nothing but a tool of the Devil to deceive the ignorant and those sophisticated reprobates who are ""ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."" Sadly, Graves is now suffering the vengeance of God's wrath in hell for his unbelief and blasphemy. Others who believe his lies, as well as those Liberal cult followers of the Da Vinci Code, will likewise fall into the same ditch. Readers beware!!!"
4,"not Graves' best, but still worth a read","My reaction to Graves' KJ was different from reading I, Claudius. Maybe it's because I'm more familiar with the Gospels and so another version of events colored my own response. Perhaps it's because the telling was not as lively and personal as I Claudius. Still it is good to read this book and to get more information about the politics during the time of Jesus - as well as an understanding of the Jews and their politics and their expectations of the Messiah."
4,Unique illustrations make this book attractive to children.,"Little cat asks you to guess his favorite color. As you turn the page, you will be surprised by the color choices and illustrations on each page. The backround colors are bright and vibrant, and each color is as rich as the last. Also, every color has a new animal associated with it. I use this book with my 7 month old daughter and my 10 year old ESL students."
4,"A little generic, but spunky artwork makes up for it...","The illustrations really make this book. The concept isn't anything special (try and guess the cat's favorite color), and the story pattern itself is predictable, although I found the ending a sweet surprise (the reason for his favorite color is not what you'd initially expect). Overall, this is a pretty book and that is really one of the biggest criteria's when searching for a children's book (bright colors grab a child's attention, and interesting and unique artwork cut through the monotony) so for that very reason I can recommend this. It is cute and enjoyable and certainly worth a read!"
4,More fun story than color teaching tool,"""What is Cat's favorite color?"" This simple question forms the premise of this simple yet cheerful color identification book. Each two-page spread features another color as the background, and uses examples from the cat's life to illustrate it.Cabrera's style uses bold brush strokes and thickly applied acrylic paint. Her animals are painted as if done by a child, and there are clever little compositional features that are delightful to discover. On one page, a cow in the background mimics the pose of the cat. In another, fluffy white clouds take the shape of familiar objects to a cat--a fish and a mouse.One unfortunate byproduct of the graphic style however, is that the colors aren't really mixed too well. The purple comes off a little lilac and the red and orange are indistinguishable from each other. But if you use this book as a fun story to share, and not primarily as a color teaching tool, you should be safe."
1,Unhealthy/poor choice toy for a child,"This happens to be a poor choice toy for a child.Reasons: Stomach showing, see-though clothing, fashion doll comes with chains, skanky top and skirt, platforn shoes, body peircings, tatoos on lower leg, representing a country in a poor manner.This is not a healthy choice toy for a child.Sighned,Cherry Trip."
1,have it....HATE IT!!!,"ok, first of all i got this for my birthday, and boy, what a waste of money!when i was playing with her and genie magic katia, i lifted her arm up to twirl and it snapped off! i never played with it again. plus her hair fell out when i brushed it. don't buy this doll, instead get genie magic katia(exclusively with bottle), or genie magic meygan. i love bratz, but not this one!"
2,Benny & Joon,"Very average movie, Jonny Debbie as wonderful as ever. If you want to see it then rent it, not a keeper"
4,BENNY & JOON,This was an exceptional tender movie. I was pleased that it showed that people with mental problems can function and be happy. I was touched that it actually brought out the love aspect that many people don't consider in this type on genre.
5,CLASSIC!,"This movie is AWESOME the first time you see it and only gets better the more you watch it. As you watch it tiny details show up and you begin to understand the characters a little bit more. This movie is extremely complex...don't get me wrong, you can take it for face value if you wish to but I don't recommend it. I have watched it countless times and each time I feel more in tune with the characters. This is an AWESOME movie that I would recommend anyone to watch!"
4,A tale for heart and mind,"A tale for heart and mindBenny & Joon is a movie about a car mechanic who lives with his mentally ill sister. Well, she's not THAT ill - but ill enough that Benny has to take care of her, and this even at the cost of not developing a life on his own.One day, a weirdo - played brilliantly by annoyingly good-looking Johnny Depp - comes to town. This is the start of changes in the life of Joon. And of Benny.This unusual movie has all a good movie needs. It is an interesting, moving and also entertaining story, told in a heartfelt way without being too sentimental. And fortunately it lacks the major drawbacks of Hollywood movie clichés!"
4,Johnny Depp is great in this role,Offbeat film with lots of humanness accented by Depp being a crazy guy who is being Charlie Chaplin. Good stuff.
5,Jonny Depp Just Beginning,"This movie was not his first,but anyone who admires his talent needs this in their collection. This film shows the begiinings of what would become an award winning actor. I only wish the other actors in this film would have done as well in later years Aidan Quinn is a treasure."
5,Calling All Johnny Depp Fans!,"This nice, little movie is hilarious not only because of the eccentricities of Joon, but also because Johnny Depp plays his unassuming self in quiet classic Buster Keaton style. The way in which he and Joon play off one another is priceless. No Johnny Depp collection can be complete without this wonderfully delightful movie!"
4,Awww,"This movie was just too cute! It is a simple romantic comedy. It has a lot of light humor and just brightens your day. The cast is spectacular, Johnny Depp is as handsome as ever. This movie is just wonderful."
4,A definite must-see...,"for anyone who just loves a really great, really cute, not so based in reality, movie. No, it's not all that deep and is a little on the make believe side, but it's a wonderful love story that makes you say ""Aaahhhhhh!"" Johnny is wonderful and shows just how versatile he is as an actor. The entire cast is good. The film has a timeless feel to it, which adds to its appeal. It may not have been a blockbuster hit or go down in history as the best movie of all time, but a great movie to watch if your in the mood for Johnny Depp and a pick-me-up romance."
5,good movie,"Bought this as a gift, receipient requested it and said she enjoyed it, so that's good enough for me. Happy New Year."
2,Overplayed and quite predictable,"Yes, Johnny Depp provides another great performance here, as does most of the cast. The story line is what drags this movie down. Beyond the slew of predictable lines and scenarios, I found the message of the film a bit shallow. ""Love conquers all...including schizophrenia."" It's just not life-like. Some of the imagery and allusions are heavy-handed at times. I wanted to scream, ""OK, I get it."" Not a terrible film, but not that great either. If you want to see a more compelling Depp film, see ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape."""
4,Gotta Love It - Who Cares if it's PG?,"I love this movie. Heck, I own it on DVD. The best thing about it is Johnny Depp, hands down. He is not only incredibly good looking (as usual) in it, but he is incredibly cute and funny as well! This movie just lifts your spirits. The only thing I didn't like as much was Aidan Quinn's character because I found him annoying and asympathetic, but overall this is a great movie."
3,okay movie,"the movie over all is cute and good, but it is definitely not a industry breaker.Most definitely a chick flick and it's a movie worth having on a girl night, but I haven't watched it again since I got it.It's not a movie that's worth tracking down, nor is it worth much more than about the 10 dollars."
5,Heartwarming and funny,"This is a movie I received for Christmas, and having never seen it before, I was so touched by it. It is a great movie to watch again and again, and Johnny Depp's facial expressions are so interesting and add so much to the movie. Great for everyone over 13."
5,Having a Boo Radley moment .............,"Probaby one of the best lines in this zany story about how love, even when it's not perfect ""is"". Johnny Depp is amazing with his pure ability to constantly charm. The rest of the cast suits him well.Other good lines..""You're out of your tree""............. ""It's not my tree""""They're both named Steven one w/ a v and one with ph""""I want to HELP"" (holding up help wanted sign)Get the movie, blend some peanut butter and Captain Crunch, wear a snorkle and enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!b. ryan akin"
3,Benny and Joon,My Girlfriend wanted this movie she says Benny and joon portrays the mentally ill as real peopleand she says its a great movie.
2,Classic example of Hollywood ignorance,"Benny (Aidan Quinn) is the brother of an autistic girl named Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson). He's a bit restrictive and protective of her. Sam (Johnny Depp), the ""quirky"" guy, moves in. Hilarity ensues. So, what's the problem? The moviemakers were not content with making a funny, lighthearted movie. Instead, the movie gets very serious and preachy about several points - whether or not Joon can live on her own, whether or not Sam needs to get a job, etc. These questions are presented as ones with obvious answers, because, of course, love conquers all, as we learn in Hollywood. Sam is portrayed as the truly wise character of the movie, while crazy old Benny is still stuck on backwards ideas like earning money to provide for yourself and caring for the mentally handicapped.There were a few funny parts, courtesy of Johnny Depp, but I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie."
2,MISFIRE,"Although Johnny Depp is to be lauded for his deft physical comedy in this romantic fairy tale, it isn't enough to save this implausible film. Depp plays a somewhat eccentric young man who finds himself filling in as a ""housemate"" to a young mentally ill girl who lives with her brother. Mary Stuart Masterson is effective as Joon, and Aidan Quinn does her sincerest best but the film ultimately fails in its ignorance of reality. Julianne Moore has an early appearance as Ruthie, the failed actress who works as a waitress and befriends Benny, Joon and Depp. The movie manages to sugar coat mental illness and we're asked to believe that this obviously disturbed young girl is capable of living on her own. While its message of love conquers all is admirable, the reality of Joon's situation is overshadowed by this sentimentality."
1,Shear Disappointment,I have wanted Benny and Joon since I saw it four months ago. I guess aiming cheap was not the best of ideas. Not only did the DVD not play on my gaming consoles it did not play on my laptop or DVD player. You'd think the one thing out of all the items whose sole purpose was to play DVDs would play it... no... it was so far from the truth. You can only imagine my shear disappointment and heart break when none of the devices about would play Benny and Joon.
2,as childish and naive you can get,"what a boring and pretentious movie! after tortured about 15 minutes, all the family members started to look each other or one another, then all agreed at the same time to reject this stupid shallow movie. depp or no depp, after twenty years, he's still playing the similar roles again and again, and never grows tired of it. but to me, and to us, enough is enough."
1,Awful,An art-nazi tour de force. Hideously cute. Avoid it at all costs unless you enjoy saccharine humor and sensitivity. I guess it could be useful in stirring the souls of the emotionally dead into feeling a new form of nothing.
5,i'm a Johnny Depp fan,This movie is really sweet amd a little quirky. Shake in some Chaplin style comedy and you have a winning match. Wow. I can't like this movie more.
5,One of Depp's best,"Johnny's definitly a great silent movie actor. His Keaton/Chaplin tricks and stunts were priceless! His eyes are the key to his success in this film. This is one of those films that didn't get any public reviews, but it's such a light comedy that has a sweet romantic side."
3,Johnny Depp sparkles...,"Benny & Joon is a mediocre example of a typical made-for-TV-movie. Except for Johnny Depp.The scenes without Mr. Depp, featuring Aidan Quinn & Mary Stuart Masterson in the title roles, tend to drag, despite the best efforts of the actors. When Depp comes into the scene, there's suddenly life. It's truly amazing.Overall score for movie: C With Johnny Depp: B+"
5,Vintage Depp! Quintessential Quinn!!,"The comedic genious of Johnny Depp and solid performances by what would today be considered an ensemble cast of what were then relatively unknown, up-and-coming actors and actresses make this movie a DELIGHT for the funny-bone as well as for the heart. I watch this movie at least once a year and it never fails to be funny and pack those odd little moments into just the right delivery. Amazing movie, poignant, sweet, and hilarious all wrapped up in sensitivity...one of my top 10."
5,Still love this movie,"This movie is a fun, heartfelt movie. This is how siblings should love each other, unconditionally. One of Johnny Depp's best roles ever."
3,"Good movie, not so great dvd","I received my order in good time. I also enjoyed the movie. You can't go wrong with old-school Johnny Depp films. With that said, I have to mention that the dvd would occasionally freeze up while it was changing chapters. It wouldn't skip, but it was rather annoying for it to freeze up like that for several seconds. It probably has to do with the manufacturing quality. The dvd I received was probably an older one, because newer dvds aren't supposed to freeze up like that when they change chapters."
3,No Subtitles for the Hearing Imaired!,"I love this movie. It is probably in my top ten movies of all time. But since I've been losing my hearing, I have been needing to use the subtitles. There are no English subtitles for this movie, so I have to turn it up so loud all the neighbors can hear."
5,Very unusual opportunity thus 5 star excellent,"Very unusual opportunity thus 5 star excellent. It is a rather bland viewing but don't let that deceive you. You would pay a few thousand dollars to play a Pro Am with a pro, where this takes you along for pennies. It is a very good purchase for a golfer trying to get in the head of a tour pro on the range and on the course."
5,Practical Advice!,"This is an easy to read, practical book for the parent of a 3-4 year old. It offers easy to read information without the drudgery of tons of reading. I think Parent Magazine is fabulous, having subscribed to it for many years myself. I'm so pleased to see that they are giving the best of what they have to offer in this book. As a behavior specialist and author of The Voucher System Behavior Management Program, I have spent a great deal of time and effort looking for a book that addresses the challenges and questions that often arise with a four year old. (Children are learning so much at age four and need a great deal of parent/child interaction. It's also the age where they learn that ""no"" really means ""no"".) This book is my choice for the best most concise book on children of this age. I highly recommend it! I also recommend the book that follows this one on the 5-6 year old."
3,Not What I Was Looking For....,"I guess I was just expecting more of a detailed book. Most of it was common knowledge, in my opinion. I'm sure it would be a good book for those starting out fresh as parents or even those going into a preschool teaching position."
2,"Good, but not great compared to others","This book was okay. It spoke about how gays deal with sexual orientation issues in the workplace. The good thing about it is that it included case studies of a gay black man and a bisexual white woman; so the authors were trying to think about diversity within the LGBT community. However, this book is simplistic and doesn't say much. There are large-scale studies and anthologies out there about gays in the workplace that are more thorough, and just better. You should consider reading this, after you've read all the other stuff on the topic."
5,This album rocks!,"I just read two reviews of this album. They said how it was just Soul Asylum from England, they went on about how it was just trying to be American, how it was this and that... Well I've heard the album. And I've heard Soul Asylum, and everything else they were refering to. They were dead wrong, if you ask me. This album ROCKS. That's all I can say. The last time I heard it was actually a LONG, LONG time ago. But I was checking out this site, and looked up Fretblanket. Now remember, the last time I heard this album was probably a year ago (I don't own it, sadly...that WILL change!). Well I looked at the list of song titles, and I could remember each song distinctly. I could remember liking every one of them. I didn't own it, and I'd only heard it a few times at my friend's house. This from someone that needs to listen to an album about 5 times before I decide if I actually like it. I heard it, and I knew. That's all I have to say. Now go buy it."
3,Tennesse Track is the bestest track in the whole wide world,"Overall the pearl harbor soundtrack was o.k. This is because the whole cd wasn't good. the tennesse track is my favorite. It is so beautiful and has so much emotion. It could make you cry.The music is what made the Pearl Harbor movie. the movie wasn't all that. It was the music that kept you intrigued. I have to give it to Hans Zimmer because he makes wonderful music.It has so much depth and meaning to it. By the way, I'm still a James Horner fan. But Horner has to come back with something really good to top pearl harbor. If you are a fan of Hans Zimmer or James Horner, buy this soundtrack and you won't regret it.Tennesse track#2 rulezzz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
2,"Great Movie, Disappointing Soundtrack","Let me just say, I loved the movie Pearl Harbor. But I found the soundtrack to be disappointing. I bought it for the Faith Hill song ""There You'll Be"" If you are like me, I recommend the single."
3,a little too sappy,"Well, if all things go well, the soundtrack would probably take a similar path to success as Titanic and afterall, the movie is touted as the new Titanic. A pity that, instead of a great historical epic, this has become a mushy love story of overblown proportions.The theme song, There You'll Be, concots a deadly combination of sappy ballad-songwriter Diane Warren and country/pop cross-over Faith Hill. Faith Hill does this ala Breathe, with full over-stretched vocals and no doubt, it's gonna be dumbly huge. It seems like boring sappy tunes never go out.The rest of the soundtrack is slightly better but still typical Hans Zimmer. Buy it if u crave for some juicy sap..."
2,Don't get bamboozled by this one!,"The so-called soundtrack for ""Pearl Harbor"" is a major disappointment. The film was full of great period songs and music. None of them are on the soundtrack. Instead, you can enjoy an hour of absolutely forgettable, mediocre orchestral background music. OK, the theme song is stirring, at least the first two or three times. But the rest is a real bore. When I want to listen to orchestral music, I go to Bach, Brahms and countless other true pros. Don't get bamboozled by this one!"
3,Three stars is incredibly generous!!,"im a gigantic movie soundtrack fan...and i have to say hans zimmer disappointed me this time around. But i cant say i blamed him...46 minutes of music for an absolutely horrendous 3 hours of movie, if your looking for a good zimmer piece, forget pearl harbor and look into ""gladiator"" or ""the rock"""
3,Pearl Harbor Soundtrack,"Adequate yet disappointing music from Hans Zimmer. Coming off of 2000's excellent Gladiator score, I expected a more martial, heavy duty score. Instead I get only 46 minutes (this includes the unecessary Faith Hill song) of soft/quiet music. ONLY 46 MINUTES OF MUSIC! I can't imagine that this is even half of what is in the actual film. Of course this only means that some months down the road we'll be treated to an expanded score. What is on the cd is good but I can't help but be disappointed. I'll just treat this as an appetizer until the REAL score comes out..."
4,Pearl Harbor / Hanz Zimmer Review,"Hanz Zimmer has a gift for film scores. There is a familiar tone in all of his scores but each still manages to remain unique and beautiful. If you have seen the movie Pearl Harbor you know how the score heightens the drama and intensity of each scene. If you are a true film score fan, as I am, you relive the movie through the music.This soundtrack is not as long and not quite as haunting as other Zimmer scores, such as The Last Samurai or Batman Begins, but it is beautiful and will not disappoint. If I had to mention a weak spot or flaw, it would be the first track, the Faith Hill song. She has a wonderful voice but the song is predictable and sounds like so many other average love ballads weighing down commercial radio today, with it's couple of versus, repetitive chorus, and swelling over done finish.But otherwise, I would say, if you like the movie and are a film score fan you will like the Pearl Harbor soundtrack."
5,Gorgeous,"What a lovely cd(as was the movie.) The music is deeply moving and emotional. Tracks 1 thru 5 remind me of the romantic scenes, and tracks 6 thru 9 remind me of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Hans Zimmer is a great composer. Also, ""There You'll Be"" by Faith Hill is wonderful and heartfelt. This soundtrack is a true gem and I recommend it."
3,Were's the rest!!!,Haven't bought the CD yet. But heard some of the sound clips. But what happened to the big band music??? I thought that's why it was called a music soundtrack. I still thinking about buying it or not...But for the price????
5,Very pleased with my CD of Pear Harbor !,"Hi ! I've just received my CD (music of the film PEARL HARBOR) today, 3rd August 2012 (ordered the 20th July). The CD is in perfect condition, only the case was a little cracked but it's not important !! I'm very happy with my CD of Pearl Harbor, wonderful music, I recommend it to everyone !! Thank you !"
4,A great find.,"I think this music is very emotional and moving. In fact, I bought the piano music (which is very easy, but very good). I'm very glad I enjoy the opening theme, because it occurs in almost every song, except for the action themes and the Faith Hill song, which I don't like anyway. If you like sappy piano music and dont mind repetative themes, you should like this soundtrack."
4,Good Soundtrack,"This soundtrack is good.It's not for sure a materpiece of film-scoring but it's always worth listening to it.It's a moving soundtrack, sometimes sweet and sometimes strong and it isn't repetitive, also because it doesn't last so much: if it last more it would surely be repeticious, but that's not the case.Well, I can't explain the matter for wich I like it and you might like it as well, I just say that I like the music and the tunes in this cd and if you appreciated the samples of the first two or three tracks, you'll like the entire cd as well."
2,Pearl Harbor Soundtrack Bombs,"While the movie Pearl Harbor is amazing, the soundtrack does not follow suite. It begins with a mediocre ballad by Faith Hill and the remaining 8 songs, while nice to listen to, are not Hans Zimmer's best work. Tracks 2-4 are so similar it's hard to tell accompanies the numerous TV trailers. For a 3 hour movie, I them apart. It does not include the powerful music that expected a much longer soundtrack. I'm sure we'll get more music when a follow up CD is released. One will no doubt be released so that consumers who want a better soundtrack have to shell out more money."
4,Zimmer - Pearl Harbor review,"Hans Zimmer is my favorite soundtrack composer and he has not let me down with ""Pearl Harbor"". The addition of Faith Hill on the opening track is a definite plus."
3,Could have been better,"Not the Hans Zimmer I'm used too. Where did all his electronic bells and whistles go? BROKEN ARROW, CRIMSON TIDE, even MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND, that's the Hans Zimmer I'm used too. I'll admit that I haven't seen the film yet and have read that alot of music from the film was not put on the soundtrack, so maybe it is there (in the film)? Maybe in a second album release. As for this one, a real TITANICy feel to it, lots of mellow stuff. Better luck next time, Hans."
4,Soundtrack is good!!! But where is Diane Warren's credit???,"Although a lot of credit went to songwriter Hans Zimmer on the album, but I don't see any credit to Diane Warren... 'There You'll Be' is a beautiful song and should of been recognized on the cd cover of the album, after all, it is on the album right???With so many hit songs, it was a disgrace to throw a very talented and gifted songwriter (Diane Warren) on the backburner and give all the credit to Hans Zimmer. No offense to him, as he wrote some beautiful songs himself, it's just that the name Diane Warren should have also been on the front cd cover...After all 'There You'll Be' was played on radio more than Hans Zimmer songs..."
5,A Must Buy CD,"This CD is nothing short of amazing. I can't comprehend how Hanz Zimmer can capture the sounds of such stunning beauty. If you love orchestral arrangements, you absolutely have to buy this album. It tops Lord of the Rings, Armegeddon, and Gladiator. I can't stress it enough, IT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!"
2,pearl harbor,"I bought this CD for Faith Hills song and hoped the rest of it would be good also. For a movie like this, and an event like this, the music just doesn't fit.There should be some very big, building music here and there isn't. It could have been much better."
2,Mediocrity Personified,I was disappointed in this soundtrack. The introductory and final songs were lackluster sentimentality. I would have hoped for something more from the producers. The instrumental offerings lacked excitement and musical tension. I would have though Zimmer would have known better.
3,Three stars is being generous!,"As an individual who owns over 75 soundtracks, I was very disappointed with the muscial scores found on ""Pearl Harbor"". Though Hans Zimmer has produced some of the most thrilling soundtracks in the past 10 years, Pearl Harbor failed to meet my expectations... especially after his recent great work with ""Gladitor"". When I first listened to the CD Thursday afternoon, I anxiously waited for a dramatic theme or movement to radiate from my speakers, but never did anything strike me as magnificent. I haven't lost faith in Hans (though the Faith Hill song is WEAK and uninspiring), I know he is one of the great theatrical composers of our day, but I hope his next soundtrack that is associated with such a hyped-up movie will match the excitement and expectation of his loyal fans."
1,Hans Zimmer writes the most recognizeable music in movies.,"That's not a compliment by the way. I would think his synthesizer would be wearing out about now. Gladiator had moments but his material is really starting to wear thin. Backdraft was good, so I guess everything else he has written must, by definition, be good as well, right?"
1,smak,"this is the guy who wrote the gladiator soundtrack!?!?! i just expected more <a LOT more> and yes, the faith hill song [stinks] bad."
2,He needs to come up with some new ideas,"Zimmer mostly just rehashes past themes from other films he's done, then throws in a track collaborated on with Faith Hill and some generic period-type music. Big deal. The film stunk and the uninspired score just had me thinking how much better the other films he's worked on were. Zimmer's better than this. The same can be said for most of the directors he usually works with. Perhaps it was just a paycheck to him...who knows."
4,I like it.,"The best parts from the movie were left out. The soft stuff was in the score, but not the upbeat really cool stuff. Hopefully there will be a second album"
4,Pearl Harbor soundtrack,When my CD arrived I immediately put it into my Bose Wave and believe me it is just fantastic music.Perfect balance with everything-- very touching music.
4,Pearl Harbor,"Pearl Harbor was absolutely brilliant. Although the love story wasn't to it's prime potentail, the effects and music were outstanding. This movie showed a superb reactant of the bombing in Pearl Harbor and gave an emtional connection to many viewers. This was probably the best factual movie since Titanic. I would definately see it again!"
2,hans falls short on this one!!,"after last year's majestic score for gladiator, i had high expectations for the pearl harbor soundtrack. much to my dismay, the music no more than ""sorta pretty"". it evokes no feelings like gladiator's worldly mood. plus, with all due respect to mr. zimmer, the defining chord sounds awfully familiar to a Enya song some years ago (i think it was enya). i don't need the faith hill song...... plus, unlike the gladiator score which the listener could visualize the story, the same isn't true with this release of the soundtrack. PLEASE GIVE US MORE MUSIC WITH A SECOND RELEASE!!"
5,Pearl Harbor (Soundtrack),I think this is a great cd !! i love the songs on there and also faith Hill song should win best soundtrack next yr in the occars and if you did not see the movie yet go you will love it as much as i did i liked it so much i stayed for the next showing of it i cant wait till it comes out on dvd and video
3,"Journalistically exciting, but scientifically inept.","Manning's book is an assiduous review of exciting new energy technology. Unfortunately, Manning is a sociologist, not a hard scientist, and she is way out of her element trying to comprehend and explain the work of new energy inventors. As a result, the book leaves far more unanswered than answered. She needed a physicist as a co-author. Still, worth reading to grasp the scope and promise of new energy technologies; but the scientifically knowledgeable reader will want far more than it delivers."
4,Buy two and give one to your local environmentalists!,"Now nearly two years old, Jeane Manning's book still stands as the best introduction to the New Energy Technology field, with an excellent resource section at the back for those that want to develop their interests further and get involved.If only a tiny fraction of this work is true, what is the environmental movement doing about to support New Energy?Advanced renewable energies, water powered cars, the inside story on the cold fusion cover-up; all written in a simple straightforward fashion. Amazing!You could give this to book to your mother or a complete novice and they would come away knowing more than most PhDs do about the future of energy and hopefully inspired to do something about it.The questions is not if this is a good book or not but why is nothing being said in the press or done to promote these incredibly important developments? A great present for every science or engineering orientated teenager too. Inspiring stuff."
2,Ms. Manning has overlooked someone....,"Having read Ms. Manning's book, it is obvious that she has somehow managed to overlook perhaps the most important pioneer and innovator of what she calls the ""free energy"" movement:JOSEPH W. NEWMANIt is incredible to me that she could write such a book without including Joseph Newman's long struggle to bring forth his revolutionary technology. Writing such a book without featuring the work of Joseph Newman is as ridiculous as writing a book about the history of aviation and omitting any reference to the Wright Brothers.I would suggest that she view his website videos at:... and perhaps she would discover the essential nature of his successful and innovative technology.Gary"
1,sucks -- seen too many x-files episodes,"too many conspiracy theories and not enough on why the ""pioneers"" of the new-energy field haven't had their experiments reproduced.i had high hopes for this book, but it turned out to be downright annoying to read. in the latest incarnation of the ""energy crisis"", a solid book on the next big thing in energy is needed -- this one ain't it."
3,Is there more than just the Austin Powers Theme?,"Well, yes and no. All the melodies are good swinger fare, but none of the others have the magic of the super-famous first track. Play it at your next dinner party; everyone will love ""Soul Bossa Nova"", then settle into conversation while the rest of the album fills the background."
1,Heavy and Cumbersome,"This 1963 entry from Jones during his big band days was a major disappointment for me. The treatments of 'One Note Samba' and 'Taste of Honey' are lead balloons. What really mystifies is why the very great LP, 'Quincy plays Mancini' from the same year, was not reissued instead of this disaster. On that record, Quincy does poignant arrangements of ""Dreamsville"" and ""Mr Lucky"", plus the haunting ""Soldier in the Rain"", that have been unavailable for over 30 years. Get with it Mercury and reissue the Right Stuff!!!"
2,This is awkward Samba played by a great Big Band,"Unfortunately percussion has completeley spoiled all tracks.This is not Bossa Nova,not even Samba.Sorry for a great project with great arrangements."
5,Happy Happy Happy!,"I absolutely LOVE this CD! It always puts me in the happiest of moods. Funny thing is, I had no idea that it was originally from the early 60's! It sounds fantastic!"
1,tasty ribs not so tasty,"these rib bones are the only bones I have had that my dog won't even touch! Amazing! they have no meat, no marrow, and I was so surprised that the dog just walk around the house with it. After about a week, I finally just tossed it in the trash and the dog didn't even care. Now I must say, my dog LOVES bones, and frankly, save your money and go to dollar general and for 3.00 buy a big ham bone."
1,The Stalker,"This movie is the ""R"" rated virsion of ""The Seduction Of Maxine"". They cut 90% of the sex scenes out witch makes this worthless to buy. Give us the real version of the movie!"
3,"not bad, good quality for an almost 40 year old tv show","I loved the series as a child when it first came out, still love the series! The dvd's really have nothing new on them, if you are looking for extra's look somewhere else, but if you just want the shows then the price was good, and the quality was fine"
2,Watch it! Price changed (doubled in a month?),"One month ago (and even earlier) this set was selling for less than half ($41) this current price ($89). While it was a great series that I thoroughly enjoyed watching as a kid, my desire to finally buy it for Christmas has been completely eliminated by the equivalent of holiday induced price gouging. I'll wait till it goes back to a reasonable price. More than a little upset with Amazon over this one. Merry Chri$tma$."
1,a repackaged space 1999 megaset does NOT a complete space 1999 30th anniversary edition megaset make.,"just how do the two differ?same number of discs (including the original bonus disc).same running time.same extras.no sale.unless, of course, a&e; has somehow obtained the RE-re-mastered complete first season from network (uk). that'd be HUGE and i'd pick it up in a heartbeat, but sadly, i see absolutely no indication of that (to date, anyway)."
2,I''d fogotten how bad this show was,Unlike most SciFi shows this show had NO BASIS IN FACT. I must have been much more forgiving as a kid I remembered liking this show at least a little but after watching it again the bazaar story lines and unforgivable scientific inaccuracy I have to give this a total thumbs down.
4,Drive your spouse crazy,"Fun series! First time I've seen series since I was 10 years old. Although, alot of the facts don't agree with my college education, I enjoyed relaxing while watching the Moon's trauma's. My wife however, would not agree. Buy the series if you enjoy science fiction and want to drive your significant other up the wall."
4,enjoyable trip down memory lane.....,"this series, which pre-dates the first Star Wars trilogy by a few years, was, at the time, the finest quality sci-fi series ever imagined. When viewing it today, some 35 years later, we can see the lack of special effects, and so forth...but I thought the effects were impressive, given the limitations back in the mid 70's (George Lucas would change all that with his Star Wars universe). Hey, at least they tried, right?what is striking is the depth and density of the writing. The writing is what makes the series believable; because, as already mentioned, the special effects have their limitations. Martin Landau really anchors this series with fine acting as the leader of the group. I find it more character driven story telling (much like the recent Battlestar Galactica series).fun to re-live (for those of us who watched it on tv when we were 6 years old); recommended for strictly sci-fi fans who can appreciate this work."
4,"""Now we're sitting on the biggest bomb man's ever made.""","The premise of the show is that a series of massive subsurface nuclear detonations sends the moon out of Earth's orbit (and the Sun) thereby consigning the inhabitants of Moonbase Alpha to an uncontrolled journey through the cold darkness of space. Hoping to find a new home on another planet, the Alphans are always thwarted in their quest for one reason or another. Either the new planet is occupied and its inhabitants do not trust humans (The Last Sunset; War Games) or the new planet is just not fit or safe for human colonization (The Last Enemy; The Guardian of Piri; Another Time, Another Place; Missing Link; Deaths Other Dominion; The Full Circle). Then there is the episode that beats them all: Dragons Domain. Not only filled with the best special effects that the series had to offer, but the most gruesome and disturbing creature you have ever seen. Do not miss it!"
2,Poor sound quality,"Not sure whether the original recordings were not preserved well or just our copy is bad, but the sound cuts out frequently on each episode. Would not buy this again."
5,space 1999 30th anniversary edition,"this series is just as i remember it,the quality is very good the sound is fair and the price is even better,space 1999 buffs you will love this collectors series."
3,Space 1999 - Guilty pleasure,"I cannot describe Space 1999 other than one of my guilty pleasures. I enjoyed the series when it was originally broadcast and I enjoyed the DVD of the series.The special effects are very cheap with visible strings on the space ships and spotlights used for a variety of alien rays and beams. Half of the stories have pretty inane plots. And, a lot of the supporting actors are marginal at best.However, the main characters are good, and many of the stories are very intersting. Also, there's a few surprises with some of the supporting actors such as Peter Cushing, Joan Collins, Ian McShane, and others.So, if you want good science fiction, buy Babylon 5. But, if you want some good escapism, get Space 1999 and it may become your guilty pleasure too."
4,Space 1999 rocks!,"However there is one thing that upsets me . In the promotion page indeed there exist the promise of spanish language of subtitles, but none of this was true. To Amazon one advice. You dont need to lie for sell. This show is great and i will purchased anyway, but please once again, you dont need to lie and deception your clients. Thanks!"
5,Classic British Sci-Fi,"I was very pleased with the picture quality of this set. One minor complaint: the episodes are not arranged by airdate but at random, so I got the play list off IMBD and am watching them in order of broadcast. Fans of American style SciFi beware: the Brits do it a bit differently. Think of a combination of 70's Dr. Who, the Avengers, and the Prisoner. The series takes itself a little over-seriously, could have used more humor (Barry Morse tried to lighten things up in season one) but it's great fun to watch Martin Landau chew up the scenery and interact so convincingly with Barbara Bain, his real-life wife. And then it's always a pleasure to watch the acting of the British cast and guest stars. One last point: the special effects are very good for that time but may disappoint a generation accustomed to CGI."
2,Historical Classic Scifi,"Even while some of the episodes are questionable and not very realistic, this is a classic show now. Having two seasons, the special effects of the time is still top-notch. While the acting is mediocre, and the story set up is sometimes way out (It was the 70's) there is some entertaining value. As a writer, I still look through this medium to see if there were any parts that can be embellished for newer ideas. What toppled the ratings of this show was the ""Mind"" entity beings that appeared on the first six or so episodes. But after that the writing started to switch to a more action oriented show. I am still looking through the DVD's as I try to remember the better episodes. Quality of picture is fine on widescreen TV's, but this is not an HDTV product."
4,Nice piece of equipment,"Being a college student, I really need something to backup my important files for when my laptop decides to mess up on me. The one touch is great, every once in a while, I'll push the button then go to bed. The only problem I have with it is the power cord. Whenever I move the drive and plug it in, the little green light on the power adapter won't turn on, you have to bash it against the palm of your hand a few times for the light to STAY on. However, once it starts working, it's really fine. I've been able to move it around the house occasionally, depending on where I'd like to work, and it plugs in and turns on. It tends not to work when it's been unplugged for a while, like when transporting it a few hundred miles back to my dorm. Other than that little nuisance, The thing's great. I love the one touch backup, the colors are pretty sweet, and the space is great to have. If it weren't for the power cord, I'd give it the full five stars."
2,Window repair review-one persons opinion,"I found the book to be very general and basic. Most of the information I already knew. There are methods of retrofitting old windows I have seen on home type programs that lightly discuss these topics and which the book does not. Also, the book could use a lot more diagrams and discussions on finishes and paint. The book limits itself to actually restoring to original working condition old windows and nothing about updating. This book is for beginners except that for beginners there should be a lot more pictures. I did find some good tips but not the information I was personally hopeing to find. I am selling the book back."
1,Big letdown after Life on Planet Earthsnop,I was very disappointed with this disc. Where were the 2 minute nuggets of brilliant pop from the previous recording? I found this disc to be both bland and tuneless. Very sad.
3,Hmmmm,"This powerpop frenzy is getting out of hand. A couple of gems - the first Fountains Of Wayne record and Cotton Mather's 'Kon Tiki' - and any band that can mange a two-part harmony and a McCartney bassline is getting hailed as the purest of pure pop on a very pure day. Enter Myrakle Brah. Like so much of what is hailed as genuis at the moment, 'Platespinner' is a pedestrian affair, with the odd terrific moment (if we're honest, it's all downhill from the excellent opener). People say it's like listening to AM radio in 1972. AND THAT'S MEANT TO BE A GOOD THING? Hey, punk did happen, and the powerpop that strikes a chord now accepts that (how depressing, to talk about the best of a genre being willing to accept another genre from 25 years ago). This is lumpy, pedestrian stodge. What next? The Hall and Oates revival?"
4,A good collection from the Science Channel,"The collection contains six presentations, including ""BLACK SKY"" an excellent documentary of Burt Rutan's development of Space Ship One, and ""BASE CAMP MOON"" which reviews future returns to the moon and development of a moon base. There are four other interesting Space Exploration presentations you may have missed from the Science Channel."
2,Too little,Goes a mile wide and an inch deep. I would rather the same book but each chapter by an expert in that area with a lesson/example.
2,"Better Prices, Limitations of this device., some Pluses","The FM stereo does not pick up well at all. I cannot get many local stations. The description says it uses USB 1.1 for quick transfers. This is misleading advertising. USB 1.1 is the slower transfer method. USB 2.0 is the faster one.Where this device excels is in conjunction with a MP3 player. The rechargeable battery means you can use it away from a power supply for a long time. The sound is excellent.This would get 3 stars due to the slower transfer speed, false advertising, and poor FM. It gets 2 stars because the price is too high for a refurbished model.I got this for $19.99 directly from Philips web site. I would check there first."
1,Gin Blossoms and Toad the Wet Sprocket,"are good bands. I saw both of them live in college, and their lyrics and stage presence are both more than I would expect from good old Bob. He should stick to the reality TV. Please don't insult Toad or the Gin Blossoms with your comparisons. I met Glen Phillips and he is a sincere and down to earth guy with some good solo work. By the way, as mentioned previously, Girlfriend is a cover by a band called July for Kings, who are pretty decent themselves."
1,Fake and Overproduced,"Any ""artist"" that takes others work and trys to claim them as their own (such as Bob, who claims the song ""Girlfriend"" is a ""collaboration"") gets zero respect from me. The song is a COVER of a song by the band July For Kings. Changing some words around does not make the copyright of the song change.So I'll admit I went into my first listen of this album with a negative additude already. However, I still do not find the album enjoyable. It is very overproduced. The only reason this guy has a record out is because he is a Reality TV star. His fifteen minutes are about up.Don't waste your money! If I could give this album less than one star...I would"
1,"Thoughtless, effortless, just bad","Maybe I could take a great song by a great band, such as Girlfriend - July For Kings, and sing my own version. Ordinarily that wouldn't really get anyone anywhere, but if you are on TV and plug your CD, then I guess it might. Reasons not to buy this CD.... 1) His first single isn't his. 2) He was the bachelor, not the American Idol. 3) July For Kings has a much better cd for a lower price due to the lack of Hype. 4) Clay Aiken puts this guy to shame. 5) His pretty-boy face, not that pretty. 6) The CD consists of thoughtless effortless jargon babbled with the intention of making money. 7) This album is awful. 8) Those who recommend this CD say things such as ""what a hottie"" ""he sang so well on the bachelor"" ""he wrote all his own mateial"" all of which doesn't make any sense. 9) He is awful 10) You could spend the money on stuff that isnt so.....awful, such as underwear that is three sizes too small, or maybe ear muffs."
1,BOB and YOKO !,"3 SIDES by that ""reality television / personality"" Bob Guiney is the worst excuse for a CD since YOKO married John Lennon and recorded material for EMI.This is one of the worst products of 2003.One can not imagine someone having the nerve to enter a recording studio laying down these tracks. Sure, it's fun to have some beers singing karaoke with your buddies but to imagine the public wants to spend money on your lack of talent is another thing.What was the label thinking ?If GUINEY has to make a promotional tour tempting the public at large with this vocal diareha, then we will know he is either nuts, tone deaf or simply the owner of a massive.... ego.Musically this is not bad, it is horrible. Listen to it LOUD...if you need to clear a room."
1,Disappointment,"I liked Bob's voice when I saw him on the Bachelor, therefore I asked for this CD as a gift. Wow, was I disappointed. All of his songs are simply less than average. The album starts off with Girlfriend, which can be seen as okay, however, it just goes straight down hill from there. In fact, I got rid of this CD within one week of hearing it. Terrible"
1,Horrible Attempt at Music,"If you're a delusional fan of 'Bachelor Bob', it rocks!!!!For anyone else, it's easy to see why Bob Guiney never made a career in music. His sound is described as being similar to John Mayer, yet Mayer has considerable talent. I would call him more of a poor man's combo of Toad the Wet Sproket and the Gin Blossoms. No tracks stand out, although I'm sure 'Girlfriend' will get some airplay when the album gets a full release. It has a feel of an album written 10 years ago, with a sound that's been heard and passed by.If you like John Mayer, buy his album. He has talent.Save time and buy it used in a $1 bin."
1,Sorry to all Bob fans,I found this CD awful. The only song halfway decent is Girlfriend. I know this review will not be popular but this is my opinion. His voice is bland and too common. Pretty much a bar band that made it big due to TV
1,14:59 AND COUNTING,"If Bob's jerk friends from Michigan would stop logrolling and giving it rave reviews that it doesn't deserve (comparing it to Bob Dylan? PLEASE!), hopefully this album will go back to where it belongs: the half off bin at the dollar store. Here's a CD worth marginally more than this one: Any free aol disk you receive in the mail. Go away, pigface bob."
1,"Ummm, sounds like a copy cat","The clips that I've heard sound like nothing more than an unoriginal, copy-cat artist. His voice is overprocessed on every track, which may indicate that he doesn't have a really good voice to begin with. This may be an attempt to extend his 15 minutes of fame. I wouldn't take it seriously."
5,Bob Rocks My World!!!,"This CD is awesome. Being a fan of ""The Bachelor"", I eagerly awaited the CD. When it came time for me to buy it, I got very skeptical. But, I love this CD. I had absolutely nothing to worry about. Bob is awesome. Don't listen to all those skeptics out there, who haven't even bought the CD and have only heard one song from the whole album. They don't know what they are talking about!!! Buy this CD now. You won't be sorry!!! Bob has a great voice and I was so suprised that he was actually so talented."
2,Give credit where credit is due.,"Ok, so I have not actually heard this WHOLE cd. I did hear Bob sing on The Bachelor show and was impressed, but then I heard ""his"" first single, Girlfriend, and was less than impressed. This is for two reasons: a) Bob doesn't really have the rock vibe, which just makes his version of Girlfriend sound wrong (in his defense, the song I heard him sing on tv was Open Arms by Journey, an excellent song, and not easy to sing I don't think). b) I can't deal with the fact that I have not heard Bob publicly credit the originators of the song Girlfriend. The July For Kings version is 100 times better than Bob's, and while I know the band probably appreciates the publicity, they are not getting all the credit they deserve. Check out JFK's cd ""Swim"" and make your own comparison, though if you like Bob's single this CD will likely not disappoint your tastes."
3,JFK rip!,"I would just like to inform all you people out there who are in love with bob that the song ""girlfriend"" is not an original by bob, but it is instead borrowed/ripped from a local cincinnati band called july for kings. i highly recommend their version and their cd ""swim""."
4,Good rock album by Bob!,"Bob Guiney's 3 Sides album was quite good. He and his band rock hard on the first couple of numbers! He writes some very emotional songs about love lost and love won over aggressive rhythms. This album makes me forget about his appearance on The Bachelor and makes me accept him as a serious musician and artist. The songs are reminiscent of some '90s alternative rock, but without the depressing themes. He sounds like Darius Rucker of Hootie and the Blowfish on a few numbers but picks up his own voice on the second half of the album. I like that he promoted the album differently without the excessive hype by performing in smaller shows and clubs. I look forward to Guiney making another album in the future because he is a rare talent."
5,Girlfriend,"This song is soo good, it's good enough to record at least twice! Listen for yourself, speaks about relationships common to all of us. Then keep listening some more to the soulful voice of Bob Guiney, the clever arrangements and music behind the voice. Hats off to him and his band!"
4,Great!,"Very surprised! This CD really is very good, Bob Guiney has a great voice and for his first CD, he is fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone even if you have not heard him sing before."
4,Will make you laugh out loud,Reminded me a lot of some of Lewis Grizzard's work. Great travel book that you can pick back up anytime.
3,"Great Book, poor publishing","Just finishing this book and it's great. But this version was created by optical scanning technology and evidently was not reviewed by anybody before publishing. There are a lot of mistakes, and it interrupts the flow of reading. Twain is such a great author that it's worth getting a version that was edited by somebody for mistakes!"
5,A Classic !,"I never thought about reading this book until I heard the Jimmy Buffett song ""That's What Living is to Me"". The intro of the song starts with the comment in the preface of the book by Mr. Twain,""Be Good and You Will Be Lonely"". I realized then that there must be some great substance in this book, since Jimmy had probably based several of his songs on the book. Being a good Parrothead, I read the book and now understand the substance. Twain's account of his steamboat voyage around the world is a classic. He mixes his subtle humor, clever storytelling, and sarcasm with his observations of life on this fascinating journey. If you don't have a sense of humor, this will give you one. Sometimes it will make you just grin, other times, you will laugh out loud."
4,Once I read the fine print...,"I was confused as to why there were many typos, and no illustrations, but this company produces their books on small scale and uses a computer program to copy the original document. This may result in typos or missed words, but over all its just fine. I just didn't realize how the book was produced when I bought it. Now that I do, I would buy more. Fast delivery!!"
4,Mark Twain - Jimi Hendrix connection,"Jimi Hendrix and Mark Twain were both Sagittarians but here's another connection:There is a passage in ""Following The Equator"" where Twain describes the most thriling experience of his life as the time he was hurtling down a Himalayan mountainside on a small-gauge railcar through a ""dreamy purple haze""."
2,High expectations (big buffet fan)... but a little boring,"I kinda liked this book for awhile. Some strange humor and interesting to see what is was like to travel at the time of Twain. I thought it was a litte long and boring and though (only read 3/4 of it). Not very exciting and a lot of quotes from other esoteric sources. Also, he makes reference to Arabian nights while in India. Aren't those stories set in the middle east and north africa? (kinda lame)"
4,"really fun read, but careful with kids","This book is a treasure. Twain's story-telling is laced with subtle humor recounting his meandering journey (as in no great hurry to get to a particular destination) around the world. I suggest you read this book in small doses, kind of like a daily conversation with a [really interesting] neighbor where stories are exchanged. I often read stories from this book to my children (ages 8 & 6) at bedtime. Clearly written in another era, Twain's sense of humor cracks me up, but some comments would today be considered politically incorrect so I make some real-time ""adjustments"" when reading it to the kids.I credit Jimmy Buffett with pointing me to this book through a reference on a CD although I don't share the opinion that Buffett's book is in the same league. As cited earlier, you can open this book anywhere, just read a chapter and it makes sense. My copy has no bookmark in it. We just hop around. Twain takes us places we've never been. Great book."
4,Mood Food,"Two solid discs of great, moody Deep House. I saw Jay Hannan spin live once, it was amazing! Get it."
4,STILL IN LOVE WITH COREY'S PAST,"It was fun watching these videos--most of them I've never seen, and the rest I haven't seen in a long time. ""Sunglasses At Night"" is by far the best with its Orwellian tone, and ""2 Good 2 Be Enough"" (which isn't listed on the outer package for some reason) is a whole lot of fun. The only drawback is that videos like ""Angry Young Man"" and ""Eurasian Eyes,"" while cinematically well-done, only feature Corey moving about the scenery, with no story and no point, making them somewhat boring. I also wish they had included subtitles on the DVD--I can't understand a lot of the words in ""2 Good 2 Be Enough."""
4,"Kentucky's Domain of Power,Greed and Corruption",I believe Jim Murray is doing a tongue in cheek- he actually gives the book a high rating so I think his comments are teasers to get the readers in Ky to think and read the book no matter if it lowers the opinions of the Big Blue Zealots etc Honesty is never out of style-Truth can always bear being examined-Ky has had glorious times in sports but it has also had its dark ages and pages-the fans cannot just claim the good and disclaim the bad- it is all of one cloth- Ellison merely tells it like it was found in her research and definitely allows the reader to see when she has her own interpretation and leaves the reader to make their own judgements -honoring their own intellect integrity and dignity
4,"So mad, I'm seeing Blue!","Regardless of the sources she used for her book, in the Bluegrass State it borders on sacreligion for an author to portray the Big Blue as Betty Ellison does in ""Kentucky's Domain of Power, Greed and Corruption"". How dare she accuse my Wildcats of anything below level as they annually attempt to add yet another NCAA banner to those already hoisted high above the playing floor of Rupp Arena! (Its actually a ""don't-put-down"" book that will make you very aware of the behind-the-scenes activities in Lexington)."
1,Can Not Read,"Please tell me how I can, either speak to a customer service rep. or send a notice to someone. I received a book, with the proper title ""Kentucky's Domaine of Power, Greed and Corruption"", however upon opening it, I found that the contents were ""The Sighted Singer"", a book on poetry. I have no idea on what I should do. I tried to get into my account, but have forgotten my password. I followed the procedure 3-4 times, and can't get an e-mail, from you giving me the password. Please e-mail me, as what I should do.... If I don't hear from ypu soon, I know nothing to but file a dispute with American Express, which will stop the payment. I would like to have the book, but I can find no way to speak yo anyone, except through this review. I hope you can help me."
1,The worst written technical book I have ever read.,"Mr. Zimmerman babbles on and on while attempting to cover a technical aspect of the Softdesk software. He repeats words and sentences, provides vague explanations, and includes incorrect data as part of the examples and practice work. I give him one star for trying."
1,Don't waste your money on this book.,"The author is good at telling WHAT Softdesk will do, but he fails miserably to explain HOW to do it. I gave up at page 80. His writing is tedious and cryptic. I learned nothing."
3,using the power of softdesk,quisiera saber si el libro comprende tambien las opciones de la version softdesk 8
2,Defective oxy acetylene torch,This was a great deal if it had worked. The gas regulator had leak by when set to zero. Amazon was not good about sending a new one they said the price had gone up and I would have to pay the new increased price. I just got a RMA and returned it. Could not get the seller on the phone. Tired of messing with it went to welding supplier and bought new. Some things just should be bought locally.
4,like it,It was a good thing. to get this for free. it a good thing that I can use it. I would get again. You should try it today or tomorrow
3,original excitement squashed,"initially excited about this product. Must say after 1st use, I haven't used it again. It's cumbersome to use because it's heavy to carry after filling it with water. I do like the fact that the water continues to be heated. One of the things I originally liked was the pumice stone. But it's in a position, where you have to take your foot out of the water to use and even then it's not that effective. So if your primary objective is to use it for exfoliating, it's not very good at that."
1,Heat function cannot work without annoying whirl feature,"I bought this product for its heating feature. To my great dismay, the heat function cannot work alone. You must use the whirl function with it. In other words, once you turn on the power, this thing is ON, ALL THE TIME! It's so annoying. I just wanted a quite bucket that keeps the water warm, which is not what this product is. Worse, once you open this item, you cannot return it for any reason whatsoever, even if you don't use it. I opened it to read the instructions, and that was it for me. When I realized that it was not how I envisioned the product to be, it was too late. So good luck!"
3,"Good, But Not Excellent","Pros: large size, heating element, air jetCons: water spill, airjet too strong, no temperature control.I received it as a gift. It has a nice large size and should be large enough for average or slight large feet. It is good to get a heated foot spa. But whenever you turn it on, the airjet started running, either low of high speed. But even the low is still strong and often time water would run all the way over the splashguard and spill outside the spa. So you'll have to use your feet to block the airjet. The heater works, but you'll have to turn it on and off and there is no constant temperature control.What I really want to see if a foot bath that has a constant temperature control and have more gentle setting on the air jet. Or make the front end of the splashguard larger to block the jetted water.I'll give it an average rating."
5,This is a great product with plenty of heating power.,The first day I received the product if filled it with cold tap water turned on the jet system and then the heat. It only took about 5 min until the the water temp was perfect. The heater turns itself off every thirty minutes which works well if you forget. You will find yourself turning the heater on and off as time goes by to keep the temperature exactly where you want it .....it can get almost too hot for comfort if left alone.....but you feel like you are in-charge.Good product that lets you get water all over you foot without having water splashing all over the place.
4,works as advertised,"Dimension of the product is big compared to the others brands, so it's kind of difficult to find place to store or carry when it's full of water.Heat works very good! And jets are strong but it's only on the front part of the feetMy husband and I love this product. I just don't give 5 stars because of the dimension and weight of the product."
3,No salts or oils,"I was so disappointed to discover than you could only use plain water with this unit. Also was disappointed that the water level didn't come a bit higher to include my ankles or part of my ankles where a lot of my pain is. The rollers were useless and i took them out, and if you do keep the pumice stone in I could foresee an accident waiting to happen if u aren't careful when putting your feet in as it can give quite the abrasion if you forget it is there. Also I probably shouldn't complain that the water level doesn't go higher as this is quite large, heavy and awkward to handle when you have to dump the water out after every use. The jets are nice, as is the fact that it heats the water but i think for the most part this will stay in the closet and i will continue to use the old bucket where i can add Epsom salts and oils to help in the relief of old tired feet and ankles."
1,comfortable but with problems!,"I feel comfort to try this machine.But three problems.first, it makes too much noisy.second, the machine is too big.third, according to the instruction, two rolling nodes and a pumice stone should be found in the box with the foot spa machine. But I did not find them."
4,Soothing product,"Easy to use and keep clean, I use this foot bath every other day to help with arthritic symptoms. The only drawback is not being able to use any products in the bath water. The recommendation is that most products clog the jets. However, I am glad I made the purchase, since it seems well designed. I have owned it for a month."
3,hot water bath,Yes it makes the water very hot and yes it makes a little bubble. Still water only comes from the front only. The pump is strong. I am not quiet sure it worth $100 since I have not tried the cheaper one.
5,Fantastic,I bought this heated foot bath after I broke my ankle to help promote circulation. I've had others that were not heated and they were a disappointment. This one is fantastic. It keeps the water heated to a toasty temperature and doesn't cool down. I also like the powerful water jets and the remote control. I highly recommend this product.
3,It's ok,"It takes a long time to heat up, but my wife likes it. It's a pain to fill up then move around, not lite at all. I think someone could do much better in design."
2,Adeguate for my needs,This product does an adequate job of cleaning your feet and does provide some relief for tired aching feet !
2,tame massage,"I pre-ordered this foot massage spa to relieve niggling pain in my feet. Though the product operated exactly as per the manual, it was rather tame. It didn't really help reduce the pain, rather it merely tried to soothe the feet. Your feet will feel good so long as they are in the spa, but the spa does nothing to reduce the pain. I didn't think its worth spending so much money to just put my feet in hot water (& that too without salts). I've returned the product."
5,Served all my needs,"I am a professional Pedicurist/Esthetician....I purchased this footbath because I lost my ""Pedithrone"" in a Salon fire in March...this footbath had been a wonderful replacement!"
2,stopped working after 4 uses,"Bought this unit directly from Brookstone over 6 months ago. Was initially great very hot water and jets were comfortable but stopped working after 4 uses. Brookstone would not replace because after it was after ""limited"" warranty coverage. This was an expensive unit and not sure if I would get another one from Brookstone or try cheaper model that hopefully won't break down."
3,Not all that,"The Brookstone foot bath was promising but it was rather disapointing for the money. While the heater does a excellent job of heating cool tap water to a nice comfortable temp , the rest of the functions are no better than the $39 economy baths . The front portion of your foot gets the best benefit from the forward placement of the two circulating jets yet the rear ankle and heel area is totally forgotten The bottom foot roller is also of little use as it is mounted too low to give any real massage action to your feet."
2,Leaked,I loved the idea of this foot bathbut the product leaked. Brookstone was great to work with for the return.
4,It is a nice foot bath!,It is a very good foot bath. The water can be heated in a short time but won't be very hot.And it is very easy to use. The only deficiency is the sound is a little bit loud.
1,Not so happy,"I purchased the foot bath because I am started to listen to all my aches and pains that my body is telling me and thought I am going to take care of myself because I do not want to fall apart at 42. I received my foot bath and was so excited. I used it 4 times and was real happy since I am on my feet all day. Well, sad to say that the heat and the massage no longer work. I tried plugging it in to different outlets thinking or hoping it was the outlet. I did not use any salts or oils like they advise you not to do. I was going to return it but it states that I cannot return this item do to sanitary reasons. Please do NOT purchase this item. It would have been a lot cheaper for me to just use a bucket of water to soak my feet."
2,Foot Baths,"I purchased this item thinking what I read about it here on Amazon would be true. Unfortunately the heated foot bath and Message is not what it sounds like. The heated part works ok, but as far as the message part, not even close. And the jets, come on, give me a break. For what I paid for this, over $100.00 and the most expensive one that Amazon had at the time I thought I would be getting a good foot bath. If I had to rate this from 1-10 I would give it a 3. Only because it does keep the water warm. In my opinion it is not worth the money or even half of what I paid for it."
2,All washed up,"Bought this thing as a gift for my wife. She was really excited to get it. Used it twice, with out any salts, and it worked great. Third time she went to use it, the jets didn't work. Got a hold of the company who sold it, and they said no problem, just send it back. So I'm thinking they are going to send me a new one, that works. Made me pay the return shipping, and just put the money back on my credit card.If I sold a defective item to someone, I sure as hell wouldn't ask them to pay for return shipping."
4,Great product!,"I bought this for my mom who is always complaining about achy feet. However, she is also a diabetic and not really supposed to soak her feet much, so she does it maybe once every 2 weeks or so, or when she really needs it, for about 15-20 minutes and I monitor the temperature for her. She loves the jets. Even though it was a bit pricier than most other spas, it has the advantage of adjusting the jets and the temperature which most of the other cheaper home spas didn't have.I plan on using it sometimes too, there's only one draw back, you can't add salts or any sort of lotions/oils to the water as it may clog the bubble jets. Apart from that, it's a really great product, especially for my mom, who can't use anything thing else to compliment the soak anyways, so she's happy. It's light weight, easy to drain and easy to clean!"
3,FootSpa,"I think that for the money the less expensive models will do the same as this does. I think the product is overpriced. It has a remote control with it which is useless if you have your feet in it you aren't going to be too far away to reach down and turn it on?? Oh well, Live and learn"
1,cheap and designed horribly.,"got it from the brookstone store. the battery in the remote was dead...one of the leg rubber pegs was off, so it was 3 legged and worse, the plug is located at the bottom of the bath, so it runs under the actual foot bath throwing it off balance. We are returning it for a full refund."
1,Doesn't work,"Jet stream came over the top and soaked me, couldn't add bath salts. Returning very bad choice and lots of trouble to send back."
4,Great for now-time will tell,"Used it for the first time today. Durably made, jets are strong, put cold water in and it heated in about 4 minutes. Remote control is indeed useful. Jets in the front and are variable-direction - would pay for a more expensive one with jets in the rear too. Will keep you posted on durability. Overall, a great first-time experience."
1,NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!,"Considering the price, this unit was a real disappointment. Within a short time the ice blue plastic ""topper"" cracked and had to be tossed. The foot bath was not as deep as I was anticipating and as far as the heat and jets they were just so so. Hugely overpriced for the quality of product it is. Better than other foot spas on the market, but not $70-$80 better. If this were priced under$50, it would be worth it in my mind."
4,Almost worth the full price...,"The Aqua-Jet Foot Spa does have some great qualties. Such as the rotatable aqua jets, which work really well. They only have two in the front where your toes are though. I wish they had something else in the back. Overall the spa does what it says but the massage nodes that help relieve stress are hard too feel when you roll your feet over them. It was kinda of a struggle to do and I had a friend try it and she had said the same. The heater does work well as long as you put luke warm water to start with. If your are looking for a relaxing foot treatment that practically knocks you out from relaxation, this is it. It may just be a little too pricy."
1,Great - if it works,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday and it lasted exactly 31 days. After that the power button quit working and the drain plug broke. I sent it back to Brookstone, as it was outside of the 30 day store return and they promptly lost it. and are now saying I'm out of luck even though I have an RMA number, a tracking number from the shipper and the original order number from Brookstone.I won't ever buy anything from Brookstone again."
5,Awesome and relaxing foot spa,"I love this foot spa. The water stays hot for a very long time....love it and so needed after a long day. My boys love it too. The only thing is, it's a bit noisy. We just turn up the TV and it's all good."
4,it is almost perfect,"Love it. It is almost perfect:1. With HEATER!!!! This is an incredible and necessary feature. It actually heats the water. I simply fill the foot spa with hot water from the shower and soak my feet for 30-60 minutes. It stays HOT!!! The heater turns off automatically every 30 minutes but I turn it on if I plan on keeping my feet longer.2. Rollers: don't do much for me! Even though this is the best foot spa I have encountered yet, this is an area where Brookstine should improve.3. Jets: love them equally much to the real heater. They are strong and work miracles on massaging tired swollen feet. I wish Brookstone adds jets to the side and back (additionally 4 more). Right now there are only 2 jets on the front"
3,Definately a gets HOT!,"My boyfriend bought me this foot spa as a present, I had read the reviews on-line and this one looked like the best choice. I have had other foot spas in the past and wanted one again. This spa does get very hot, though it takes a while to warm up so I definitely recommend starting with warm water. It is very large and will comfortably accommodate a large foot, but I have smaller feet so this really matter to me.I didn't give it a higher score because I was slightly disappointed with the jets, which are movable but are placed at the front of the spa. My past foot spas have and jets or at least some bubbles which massage the bottom of the foot. This one has plastic bumps with are only mildly helpful. If your looking for an amazing massage from a foot spa this isn't it. All in all its a good foot spa, but for the price you may find a better one out there."
2,IF ONLY THIS WERE TRUE,"By the time this 9th entry in the Jason Voorhees franchise was released, the series had become tired and ultimately redundant. In an effort to put more life in it, we are faced with a Jason who is killed but like in THE HIDDEN (a far superior film), he manages to live using host bodies. Although the screenwriters try to give us more motivation for Jason's murderous rampage, there is little suspense or novelty in the movie. Jason manages to kill off a few people, and his sister is recruited to finish him off. No real acting honors in this one, although Steven Culp manages to do well in his role as a tabloid tv producer. The ending is a joke in itself, with its reference to future Jason adventures. Not the best in this series."
2,wtf?,"I cant beleive they did this, they added a crapy plot, ""only a vorhees can kill a vorhees"" WTF??!!!!???!! jason had a sister? what a stupid plot, then at the end you see freddy's hand grabbing jasons mask and pulling it down under the ground (telling me freddy vs. jason is next).if you want to collect the friday the 13th film's i sugest part's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and X."
3,"Stupid, but fun to watch..","Jason goes to hell The final Friday, the supposed last in the series(well they lied, Jason X is coming up)is one of the better in the series but is still very dumb. The movie starts off with big ol' Jason gettin blown to pieces in some kind of police ambush. So Jasons spirit takes over a doctor now, (who was studying jasons remains and eats his heart,for some reason)and now all of a sudden jason has a nice new body and so he heads home to do battle with his sister. But this wont be easy for jason as he will have to get by Creighton Duke, a bounty hunter who wants to send jason to hell, but he will need the help of jessica(who is related to jason all-of-a-sudden) as she is the only one who can really kill jason and put him away for good. The movie has a really fun conclusion as we get to see jason go to hell( or at least until Jason X like i said). But nonetheless it is an improvement over part 8 which was really screwed up.."
1,They're keeping hell hotter these days,"Jason's back again but as his body is finally destroyed, we discover that he has a sister we didn't know about (thanks for telling us). He tracks her and his niece down to end his family line and be reborn. Repulsive to the maximum and has no real worth whatsoever. Some clever dialogue is wasted. If you're heavily sedated, then help yourself."
2,Better than Jason Takes Manhattan,Yes part 9 or Jason goes to hell is a classy entry in the series.Jason's soul jumping from one body to the next might seem ridiculous but they have tried everything else.
1,For Hardcore Friday Fans Only!,"So why is this movie for us hardcore fans only? 'Cause only a hardcore Friday the 13th addict could stand watching this senseless stupid movie.The director claims that he wanted to give us something different; well, he did. The only problem being that he did not really give us a Friday movie. I don't know what movie this really is; perhaps ""Invasion of the Jason Body Snatchers"" but definitely not a Friday.If you like old school Jason, then get part 6 or 7. They are more traditional.Oh and hey, since when the hell does Jason have a sister!!! OMG, talk about stupidity!"
5,SURPRISE!,"THIS IS ANOTHER DIFFERENT MOVIE-BUT STILL EXCELLENT!IT'S STILL SCARY,SUSPENSEFUL,AND INTERESTING.THIS EEL LOOKING THING FROM JASON GOES INTO THE MOUTHS OF PEOPLE - IT TAKES OVER THEIR BODY.IN ORDER TO KEEP LIVING - JASON NEEDS TO BE REBORN.HE WAS BORN FROM A VOORHEES,HE HAS TO BE REBORN FROM A VOORHEES,AND HE CAN ONLY DIE FROM A VOORHEES.YOU HAVE TO GET THIS TO SEE WHAT I MEAN."
2,THE WORST FRIDAY! ....BUT IF YOU WANT THE COMPLETE SERIES!,"Well, I thought Friday the 13th part 5 was bad!? This is the worst ""Friday"" by far and it's only redeeming quality is the nice DVD release and the fact it opens the door for Freddy VS Jason! For that reason alone I rate it 1 1/2 stars!Unfortunately Freddy VS Jason was shelved for many years and was released after Jason X?! Which doesn't make any sense, so we have to pretend that Freddy VS Jason came out before Jason X to have this even begin to make sense.(I use the term loosely!) The only postive thing I can say about this film is that it's got a way too good DVD release and it makes Jason X and Freddy VS Jason look all that much better!I was really disappointed with this entry even though 'Jason Takes Manhattan' isn't much better! If you want to complete the Friday the 13th series, it should be seen as it does set up the superior sequel 'Freddy VS Jason'."
3,Where is the Unrated DVD?????,Did they ever release this unrated on DVD?? The VHS release was the unrated version and thats what I am looking for. Anyone know??Has anyone compare this DVD to the VHS version? Thanks.
3,Friday the 13th Jason Goes to hell,I though this was a good movie because jason takes on a mortal human form and in the movie he is desructable and that makes it a more root for the bad guy because he might actually lose. This movie actually gets into a more mystical type version and it goes into the legend and the hidden secret of how to kill him. but the down side is in some parts when you cant see his legs he moves a little faster than he really can also his head is slightly deformed and strangely bumpy. check out my reviews on the Halloween movies.
2,Horrible sequel what were they thinking,How could anyone think that Jason was dead. That killer in it was smart in saying he's not but what makes the world think he can stop Jason. I was really disappointed with this one even though my standards for Friday movies are extremely low. I really only watched this for the end part when Freddy's hand pulls Jason into hell and belive me it wasn't worth it one bit.Another horrible thing about this movie was it's cast. That fat diner owner was so stupid with the whole Vorhees Birger and Jason fries. When Jason came in there I was so happy when all of them were killed. This one was really disappointed when I saw this and it isn't even worht the two star rating I gave it.
3,Pretty Good!!!,"I first saw this movie on T.V and I watched it because I never saw it and I expected a little more from this onw.Total jason is one like 15 min of the movie.But the movie was good.At the end was really scary,after jason went to hell his mask laid on the ground, and Freddy Krueger's hand poped out and took his mask.And I'm like it cant be, Freddy and Jason going at it, thats like the 2 top killer legands in the world, Freddy vs Jason is coming out on DVD and when I get it, im gonna be rite on front of that T.V"
4,"Jason goes to hell,DVD review","This DVD has some cool extras like R and Unrated versions to watch,widescreen and fullscreen formats, and the all acess pass features audio commentary by Adam Marcus and Dean Lorey commenting on the unrated version only,TV version alternate scenes not as good,jump to a death scene extras are cool,and the original theatrical trailer.only reason this is not 5 stars is because there is no deleted scenes because there were some scenes cut from this film like there's no scene when David gets his face smashed against a faucet and teeth fall out and blood goes in the sink and also there's no scene when the red devil-like creature pulls Jason to hell instead cookie-looking rubbery hands pull Jason down to hell.hpoe thre will be a DVD with deleted scenes soon"
5,JASON GOES TO HELL - The Final Friday,finally on DVD director Adam Marcus's uncut version is out it's in dts 5.1 bloody sound it is the all time greatest no the absolute best horror film in the FRIDAY THE 13TH series buy it now
2,Jason dies and is reborn into movie hell,"I have always been a fan of the Friday the 13th series. I'd seen each of the movies a dozen times, but had somehow missed this particular movie. I barely even remembered hearing about it.I finally got to see it a few days ago and, wow... I mean, I honestly gave this movie a chance. I really did. This installment into the series is what PART 3 was to the HALLOWEEN series. Jason is barely in the movie. When you do see him, his makeup job is so weak that he becomes more comical than imposing or frightening. Now, I love Kane Hodder as Jason, but the acting in this movie is absolutely bottom shelf. There are a few decent visual effects, yet there are more than enough cheesy effects to counter and totally eclipse the good.This is the 2nd ""mulligan"" of the series: along with part 5, fans will wish they could simply remove them from the series and forever forget them."
2,Friday the 13th- part 9,"Jason, the living, breathing essence of evil, is back for another fierce fling. Tracked down and blown to bits by a special FBI task force, everyone now assumes that he's finally dead. But everyone is wrong. Jason has been reborn with the ability to assume the identity of anyone he touches. The terrifying truth is that he could be anywhere. Or anybody.One of the weaker installments in the franchise. The one bright spot in the film is actor Steven Williams (who would later play the role of ""Mr. X"" in the series ""The X-Files""). His character is interesting, and he plays it with energy and comedic touches."
2,NO NO NO,THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST OF THE SERIES. JASON IS ONLY IN 2 SCENES THE BEGINNING AND THE END. THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE HE IS POSSESSING PEOPLE AND CONTROLLING THEM FROM INSIDE THEIR BODIES. THIS MOVIE BLOWS PART 5 IS BETTER AND TAT BLOWED TO 5 IS BETTER CUS THEY ACTUALLY HAD A JASON LOOK ALIKE AND U FIRST THINK ITS JASON. I GAVE THIS MOVIE 2 STARS CUS OF THE AMOUNT OF GORE IN IT.
3,JASON GOES TO HELL DVD Review!,"While the movie itself is the kind you either like or you don't. I know many people really hated it but if you are the type who enjoyed it, this DVD has plenty of features you will probably enjoy. Most noteably is the inclusion of the scenes that were included in the TV version as well as an audio commentary by the film's director. You get both the R-Rated version as well as the unrated version included too."
3,BEST ONE,"This chapter features Jason in a short role but a coroner,cop,and newsman are the killers taking over Jason.it starts when Jason is blown to pieces by the SWAT and FBI,so when a coroner eats Jason's heart,the coroner starts Jason's usual murders,then the coroner puts a worm of Jason in people.this one has some extreme deaths like cuts a woman in half is explicit in Unrated version,and a woman has her head squeezed explicit in Unrated version.AWESOME MOVIE."
3,Not a bad movie,"This is by no means a bad friday movie.it has eveyrthing you love about those movies like blood,gore and nudity.you dont see jason alot cause hes inhabiting the bodies of other people but this movie is still good.any friday fan should like this one and the ending is so cool...even if you already know the result.for the price or for any horror/friday fan you should buy this movie its worth it."
2,If your a Jason fan.....,"First off I LOVE THE ""FRIDAY THE 13th"" FILMS!!, but as a movie fan this is BY FAR the WORST ""Friday"" film off them all, turning one of the most popular slashers of all time into what looks like one of the ""ALIENS"" after bursting through a chest and then having him switching from body to body ala ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" has to be ONE OF THE WORST IDEAS IN MOVIE HISTORY!! About the only thing that was semi enjoyable in the film was the end and I wont spoil it for you guys that havent seen it. I gave it 2 stars, one because the movie is watchable and the other because im a fan of the series. If your a collector of the ""Friday"" films its a no-brainer to get it to complete your collection. If you're looking for a good horror flick...STAY AAWWAAYYYY!!!"
1,"Poke your eyes out, it's more fun.","I love Friday the 13th, and all the other slasher films of the genre. But this movie was perfectly terrible. No redeeming quality, not even good kills from Jason, since Jason wasn't even in the movie. Almost as bad as Halloween 3, and that was bad."
2,Does Not Make Much Sense,"Now I know that horror flicks aren't supposed to make alot of sense, but there comes a point where leaving too much unexplained and unaccounted for detracts from the quality of the movie. And that is the case with this film--how does Jason have a long-lost sister? What is the Necronomicon doing in the house? What's with the bounty hunter and his special dagger? Not very well thought out."
3,"Okay, but needs more Jason!",There's finally some originality in the series but they blow it with lousy kills carried out by Jason in someone else's body! No! I guess it would only be logical that there would have to be some paranormal activity going on to resurrect him from the literally blown to bits position the FBI leaves him in. You know what the greatest part of this movie is? The cameo by Freddy Krueger at the end of the movie!
3,yeah yeah weve heard this all before,not even hell can apparantly stop this guy.i counted 80 people that mickey and mallorey killed on natural born killers.jason did the same in his whole career!not to talk him down though hes cool.its the same as any other jason movie only more definate supposedly at the end.after this hes alive in space in jason x and fighting freddy in part 11.itsa bit over average as far as the series goes.the part where he actualy goes to hell is cool visualy.its cool check it out!
1,"Good Idea, Bad Movie","The concept that the movie was trying to go after was definately a good one. However, as usual, the whole movie was a huge bomb. There could of been so much more to the storyline and the acting could of been so much better."
2,Not bad,I watched the special features of Jason goes to hell. They said this is the end of all Jason movies. Ya ok.... do they really think the way they ended it no one is going to think of a way for him to come out of hell. If Jason was able to come from hell to grab his hooky mask and laugh about it. I'm pretty sure that mean's he will or can come back from hell. But nice try on trying to end this movie. Which by the way is a big change out of all Jason movies. What is the big changes in this movie compared to all the others? Well Jason is able to kill living in different body's.
3,"""Ok, But Could've Been Better!""","Kane Hodder and John LeMay star in this 1993 horror sequel.Crystal Lake killer, Jason Voorhees tries to resurrect himselfthrough possession. This is ok, but I think it could've beenbetter. This dvd not only has nice picture and sound, butrated & unrated versions plus deleted/alternate scenes,commentary and the trailer. I still recommend this foryour Friday the 13th or horror collection."
2,not impressed.,"this movie was almost as bad as ""Jason X"" (quite possibly the WORST sequel to come out of any movie ever - and ive seen major league 2: back to the minors).this movie forces you to sit through an hour and a half of boring ""weve-seen-this-before"" horror movie cliches only to find the best bit of the whole thing is the last 30 seconds.however, if youre a die-hard fan of the friday the 13th series (which means you should have seen this years ago) and actually had to pay to see Jason X, this movie is for you - but im sure youll agree with me."
1,No no no,"I truly love the Friday the 13th series, but what the hell.First of all there is no real Jason. Its is just him possessingothers which defeats the purpose of Jason. That's whathe's for. To appear behind someone out of this air andhack them. Good luck getting through this one."
4,Wierd but creative,"... Jason is back and is now killing differently. The story starts off with when a swat team blowing Jason up, then we go to his autopsy when somehow the doctor gets possesed to eat Jason's heart which sort of wakes him up. Jason comes back but is in the doctor's body and goes back to his murderous ways. The only way you can really tell who Jason is inside of is that the person's reflection on a mirror, puddle, metal etc is not him/her but Jason.Jason has two killing ways:1} He just normally kills somebody2} He transports his soul to another body and the body his soul came from dies.The only way Jason goes to hell is by being killed by someone from his family (which is told by a bounty hunter who wants to kill Jason). ..[this movie is kind of interesting.] This movie is weird but still good. So if I were you, I'd buy it!"
4,YOU'RE ALL DOOMED!,"This movie being ""Friday the 13th Part IX"" really stands out from the other 8. Especially since Jason can be anyone at anytime, but how was he ressurected this time? At the end of part 8, we saw him drown in a wash of toxic waste and all of a sudden, he just jumps in front of that girl in the beginning! Did I miss something? Also you see alot of images from other horror movies in this. The Necronomicon from ""The Evil Dead"", the crate from ""Stephen King's Creepshow"", and even Freddy Krueger from ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" makes a small cameo. The movie could have used more shots of Jason with the hockey mask on though. That would've made it scarier since his body is almost completely decomposed now. Other than that, the movie was great and I can't wait until ""Friday The 13th: Jason X"" comes out this summer!"
1,a poor attempt to end the series,"Ok, I'll admit; I liked the ending of Jason goes to hell. The idea of Freddy's hand pulling down Jason's mask was great but that was the only good part about the movie. Again, as I said in my review of Part 5; Even though Jason was practically not in this movie that isn't the reason I'm trashing it. The plot itself was ridiculous and it took eight sequels to decide that only a relative of Jason can kill him by stabbing a ""selected"" knife through Jason's heart. Come on, even I could have come up with something better than that. Like Part 5 & 7, this is a real stinker. Fortunately, this movie did not end the series."
1,The worst ever !Texas chainsaw massacre is better!,This is the worst horror movie ever made because it is stupid and it does not make sense at all.This movie panned and it stinks!
1,No offense to people who accually like this but....AWFUL MOVIE!!!,"The first time i watched this movie I really did not know what to think. So I watched it a second time, giving it another chance but....OH MY GOD this movie is horrible. A Horror of a Horror film is what it is. In my opinion this is the worst friday the 13th movie! no offense to the ones who like it, this is just me speaking my opinion. sorry...I hated this movie! don't buy it.the end."
3,Hell with a touch of Jason,"Jason Goes To Hell,isn't bad or great movie,but a fun watch on a cold windy Friday night. I like it & it's part of my set of Friday 13th movies.I had to have it,so if you like great & not .. I don't care,I'am glad I have my copy.Hay! Jason, pass me salted nut's mix ."
3,"Well, it's sort of entertaining.","With the 'officially final' Freddy film out (though it wasn't really the final one at all), the makers of Jason Voorhees jump on the bandwagon and trundle out the 'officially final' Friday the 13th.It has its moments, but it's not really a Friday the 13th film at all. Jason apears at the beginning, seemingly having made his way back to Camp Crystal Lake, but then is blown up and spends most of the rest of the film jumping in and out of various peoples' bodies. The serial-killer hunter makes for an interesting character and there is some black humour concerning people cashing in on death and disaster, but I'd expected more from Jason's swansong, specially given the high quality of his recent films.Not a compltely awful film, but just not realy aimed at Friday the 13th fans - and the story about Jason's past sticks out as contrived and is more akin to 'alien body-snatcher' films."
2,BADLY MADE,What's wrong with the screen? It's too bright. They were REALLY struggling to keep FRIDAY13 alive by this point. So much so that Paramount gave up on it. It's their own fault for not making them better than they should have been. My Friday the 13th rewrites will be 10 times better I promise you that.
2,They Stole A Good Idea,"I will have to admit, this film is pretty good but they stole their idea. The film ""The Hidden"" was just like this. Friday The 13TH Part 9: Jason Goes To Hell was a copied movie. The Hidden was a great movie. The Hiddden was made in 1987, Friday The 13th Part 9 was made in 1993 so you can tell the producer of Friday The 13TH stole their great idea. Friday The 13th Part 9 is alike to The Hidden because they have this killer that hops from body to body by spitting a snake alien thing into their mouth and then the one with the snake alien thing is the new killer. ..."
4,one hellish movie,i watched it on video a couple of years ago and i got it on dvd last year and it was uncut which i thought was better than the video it is a total classic but jason x is better than the other nine movies put together
2,OFF THE MARK!!,"People that give this movie a good review,forget what the story is about.You can't follow the same storyline for 7 parts and then screw it up with Manhattan and this scifi bodysnatching garbage.Two stars for begining and ending and it's apart of the greatest horror legacy,so I do have it in my collection."
1,worst one,This one is perhaps the worst one I've seen of the Jason series. I couldn't even sit though it all.
1,THE WORST OF THE SERIES,"I AM A HUGE FAN OF FRIDAY THE 13TH, AND THIS IS THE WORST ONE YET COMPARED TO PART 5. THE MOVIE IS TERRIBLE AND JASON IS ON SET FOR ONLY TWO SEQUENCES, THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE HE IS POSSESING PEOPLE AS THIS LITTLE LIZARD THING(SINCE WHEN DOES JASON LOOK LIKE A LIZARD). THIS MOVIE IS A DISGRACE TO FRIDAY THE 13TH AND THAT IS WHY IS DOESNT HAVE A FRIDAY THE 13TH LOGO. THIS MOVIE BELONGS IN HELL. IT ENDED PERFECTLY AT THE END OF PART 8 THERE WAS NO REASON TO MAKE THIS ONE. I SHOULD SAY TO THE DIRECTOR WHO MADE THIS MOVIE TO STOP WHILE HE CAN BECAUSE HE CANT MAKE A JASON MOVIE AND SHOULD NEVER TRY AGAIN TO. DO NO WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS MOVIE. PART 5 WAS BETTER THAN THIS MOVIE AND IT DIDNT EVEN HAVE JASON DOING THE KILLINGS. I WISH THEY WOULD JUST BAN THIS MOVIE OFF THE SHELF IT DOESNT DESERVE TO BE AROUND. PLEASE BAN THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The last one....thank god?,"I am going to be generous to the final film in the Friday the 13th saga. So I gave the film three stars. It didn't surpass the original although. On the positive side there are a lot of shocking 'jump' scenes, good acting and the music is composed by Harry Manfredini, the original composer of the classic, creepy Friday the 13th movie. The situational area is good. Camp Crystal is revisited, a neglected old wasteground and we also get to see the Voorhees house. But the plot is still terrible. Jason is finally dead, blown to pieces at the beginning. We think that's it but Jason's heart is still alive and soon he starts to possess people. bounty hunter Creighton Duke knows the secret to Jason's invincibility. Can they stop Jason before it is too late? This film did make me check the house twice I must admit but the plot is terrible and so is the film in all fairness so producers, stop!"
2,not anywhere near of what it should've been!,"when the movie had been started for like 30 minutes i started to get confused...i wasnt completely dissapointed though...it was an alright movie, its just so different than the other F13's...I wasnt expecting something like this...but the main question i thought about was ""why did the doctor eat jasons heart""?...I mean, thats just plain dumb n stupid n such...i didnt like the idea of them putting jason into other bodies..it was dumb..I could have made a WHOLE lot better F13 movie than that...Its like i said...This movie is not all THAT bad (its pretty bad though)...i wouldnt recommend renting it.."
3,"Friday the 13th Part 9 ""Jason Goes to Hell the Final Friday""","Jason Voorhees does a lot better killing in this movie than the last two. It isn't as great as the ones before 7 and 8 but its better than 7 and 8. The best part af the film is at the end, you see the mask of dead mass murderer Jason Voorhees lying on the ground when suddenly Freddy Krueger's hand flings out of the Earth and takes the mask to hell with it. You'vr gotta have this movie."
4,The Final Friday....I Don't Think So,"When released Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday closed out the Friday franchise perfectly. The film had a good cast, action sequcnes a nice sex scene and the black man lived until the end. Make sure you see this film in the unrated directors cut though. I don't know what they are thinking with Jason X though."
2,What a Mess,"This movie is a nonsensical barage of noise and gross-out ugliness. Why they bother to pretend that this is the same ""Jason"" as in the original Friday, I don't know. I guess they think the audience is pretty dumb. By 1993, it was apparent that 'they don't make 'em like they used to.' The 80s horror flicks were so much better, less loud, less obnoxious, and more fun. This is trash."
3,Horror cornocopia - or however you spell that ...,"This movie is bad. Really bad. But most horror heads are into the whole bad acting thing. What made this film stand out for me are all the homages here, where to start:The Hidden - they use elements from ""The Hidden"" to show how Jason jumps from body to body.Halloween - they steal Myers origin and apply it to Jason (so to speak). Also, in one scene, the lead actress tells one of the inempt cops that she left her ex for dead, ""just off the Myers house"".Tales From the Crypt - The box that held the Tazmanian devil is right there in the Vorhee's basement.Evil Dead - The Book of the Dead is also an artifact to be found in the Vorhee's house.Nightmare on Elm Street - Freddy's here - just wait and see.There are other homages from Ghoulies to lord knows what. I enjoyed it though and you might want to rent before you buy.Recommended."
4,Jason's dead!,"I've been waiting to see this for may years now, and it was worth it. I wasn't dissapointed! What I enjoyed about part 9 here is the Special-FX, and the non-stop crazy action! It's fun, scary, and possibly the MOST gruesomest of them all. I've seen the previous 8 films in this series except this one, and I think its the best one yet!! BTW, look for Freddy Kruegar in the closing sequence. CHECK OUT: ""Jason X"" (part 10). IT'S COMING SOON!!!!"
2,Friday The 13th Part IX STINKS !!!!!,"Though I like th Friday The 13th series, this one STINKS!!!!!Jason is a little worm transfering from body to body. Jason is only in the beginning and the end. Though it stinks, A Nightmare On Elm Street's Freddy Krueger makes a special appearence at the end by sticking his right hand, ( The one with the claws ) out of the ground and pulls Jason's hockey mask to Hell with him. So, only if you are a die hard fan you should , if not, don't see it. You are wasting your money."
4,if only this wasn't part of the series...,"as a horror movie this is great, as part of F13 it doesn't fit it. all of a sudden jason has new relatives, can jump from person to person, and can only be reborn/die through a voorhees. plus the actual Jason is only in the film for a few minutes. However, Jason X look great whenever it comes out and hopefully someone can write the perfect script so we can get Freddy vs Jason. BRING BACK THE TITLES, ""FRIDAY THE 13TH PART..."""
3,Review of the final Jason film,"For the second time, Jason is supposed to die for good. Who are they fooling? Anyways, Friday the 13th fans probably won't like this ninth entry as original producer, Sean Cunningham decided that he didn't agree with the concept of a hockey mask for Jason (if only that wasn't the most popular image of the last 7 films) so instead we have a ridicilous tale about Jason being some time of body-snatcher.While this movie is full of gore and has some entertaining moments, this script would have worked better as its own film rather than just taking a dump on a popular horror franchise. While billed as the final entry, Jason returns in outer space for JASON X and takes on Freddy Krueger in FREDDY VS. JASON."
4,Jason Goes To Hell....Boy Does He ever.,"When I first saw this movie I did not see any other Jason Vohees slasher films. Although this movie is extremely gory (there's a scene where he sqeezes a woman's head and blood shoots out the top) it's really cool. The story: Jason is blown to bits by the FBI but when the morge guy sees his heart begin to beat it posses him to eat it. Now he has become Jason Vorhees. Cool but maybe a little to gory. There is also an uneeded sex scene but I guess that keeps with the Jason films. Rated R for gore, gore, and more gore, a sex scene with nudity, violence, and profanity."
3,Okay,This movie was okay. It wasn't great but it was tolerable. It's not one of the best but it was one of the good ones.
5,good second worst in series nc-17,i love f-13th and the ones that are bad are still good gets stupid and boring at time the unrated version as bad as a nv-17 version lots of gore including a naked girl cut in half And lots of nudity including boys strong sex and graphic language
3,Fair movie but not Roy Rogers,"This movie is mislabeled. It is not the Roy Rogers movie ""Heart of the Rockies (1951)"" but it is the ""Heart of the Rockies (1937)"", one of the Three Mesquiteers Series.Both good movies, but hardly interchangable."
4,Recent Purchase,"The recent purchase came quickly and was in very good condition. I don't know if I read the description wrong or if it was listed wrong. I was under the impression that the item was a CD , however when it arrived it was a DVD. It's good but I thought I was getting a music CD. Please sellers be sure it's very definitly listed as CD or DVD."
2,Know What You Are Getting,"Please understand that this is NOT the orange Michael W. Smith Worship CD translated directly onto a DVD. This DVD is a compilation of the Worship and Worship Again CDs. Make sure you research the songs contained in this DVD, so you will not be disappointed, as I was."
2,Disappointing is just the beginning,"This DVD is disappointing to say the least. From the moment Michael enters the arena through the crowd I feel like I'm watching carefully scripted theatre rather than worship to the King of Kings. The focus here is Michael W. Smith, ""Worship Artist"". Michael appears stiff and very conscious of the cameras, his movements choreographed. The direction is average, lacking inspiration and repetitive. The only moment I felt my spirit engage was during Awesome God. If you want a truly amazing worship experience on DVD I suggest you avoid this. You're better off buying Hillsong's ""Blessed"" or Christian City Church, Oxford Falls' new album ""Lift""."
5,Great music,I like Michael W. Smith music . I had this item before but it got use a lot. So I need new dvd.
5,Straight Ahead Swinging Jazz,"What a beautiful no nonsense album! I have been a fan of Zoot and the Count for decades but this is the first time I've heard them together (1975) and it's the first time since the early Decca sides that I've gotten a chance to hear the Count stretch out. Good grief what a clinic in straight ahead swinging piano playing. My last records of Zoot were from the 50's. He has changed somewhat in his tone (heavier and a little rougher) and his style (a little more economical and less complex - if that's possible). Occasionally I will hear an old Zoot phrase sneak in - anyway, he still swings in the unique Lesterian sense. The real pleasant surprise to me is the bassist John Heard who is new to me. What a wonderful line he lays down. Finally, Louie Bellson is unobtrusive while firmly driving the group."
4,Basie Strides,"I agree with the previous reviewer. However, on this CD Basie shows not just his ability to ""create an entire rhythm round a single note"", but also his ability to go back to his roots in the stride style and to play full blooded two handed stride piano. ""I Never Knew"" and ""Blues for Nat Cole"" are wonderful illustrations of how dynamically Basie could play when he wished to.Sims is also in great form, the rhythm section is supportive but unobtrusive (no time is wasted on bass solos),and this is a delightfully hard - swinging disc. Recommended."
5,Just Plain Fun,"I first got this album in 1980 (or so) (back when you could still get Vinyl). Back then I was a Basie big-band fan and this was my first introduction to Zoot Sims. I liked it pretty good back then.Recently, I got this on CD to listen to it again (I really need to get a turntable to re-animate my old albums!).This time around, I think I was able to appreciate this on an entirely different level. It's clear that this is just a couple of friends having a good time playing some music that they themselves enjoy playing. I am sure that I enjoyed this music so much more the second time around!"
1,"""Too Boring"" Notice","I am a fan of Hugh Grant especially for the comedy movies Nine Months, Notting Hill and 3 Weddings and 1 Funeral. I also liked Sandra Bullock in movies like The Net, While you were sleeping for her excellent performances. So, with great expectations I wanted to see this so called comedy but it was a total disappointment. The movie was so boring that I could not even finish it. The actors look ordinary, the story looks ordinary and so the treatment. A total waste. The stardom is wasted and so is our time too.Was the movie taken it two weeks?"
4,Fun but not mindless entertainment,"Some might consider this fun but mindless entertainment but the movie does manage to avoid many of the usual cliches of light-hearted romantic comedies. Bullock and Grant play well off each other and the snappy dialogue is reminiscent of the best Cary Grant romantic comedies. The days of those great actors and movies might be gone but this movie is the next best thing. Overall, a fine effort by the writer, director, and actors and worth seeing."
3,"Sandra Bullock Doesn't Go Unnoticed in ""Weeks""","In the new romantic comedy ""Two Weeks Notice,"" Sandra Bullock plays Lucy, a very busy attorney with no free time whatsoever. After getting tired of her self-centered boss George (Hugh Grant), she decides to call it quits. As she searches for her own replacement, George thinks he may have feelings for Lucy. The movie is very funny with witty dialogue and slapstick humor. Sandra Bullock is funny, charming, and very fun to watch. She and Hugh have great chemistry. It's kind of romance-flick, but the frequent humor makes it smooth and successful, and definitely noticeable."
1,Witless,"An absolute dud! This movie is poorly written, ineptly directed, and edited with no sense of comedy or continuity. I am a big fan of both Grant and Bullock, but I have to say that this is one of the WORST movies that I have ever seen!"
3,"Totally predictable, yet entertaining","From the first 5 minutes you know that this is probably another soft comedy that would not win any prizes. Yet the movie runs smoothly, it is entertaining and would make you spend almost 100 minutes of your time pleasantly. Grant and Bullock match well, Grant throws some good lines of british-dressed humor that will make you crack a lot of smiles - no big laughs though. A home movie you can watch over in time."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"""Two Weeks Notice"" was a little disappointing. I had expected a movie with two of my favorite actor/actress in it to have more sizzle, because I know they have it in them.Sandra Bullock is cute, as always, and Hugh Grant, always dashing. but Two Weeks Notice admirably avoids the obvious. It was a little hard to catch on that his ""partner"" was his brother. If you had not been paying close attention, you would/could have missed that factor. A better job could have been done in the script."
4,One of the funniest Sandra Bullock movies,"There were scenes in this movie that were pee your pants funny--specifically the great bathroom search and the stapler incident. There were also plenty of times when this story dragged. Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock make an excellent romantic comedy team. Both have shades of the straight man, but are able to pull off some broad comedy as well. This ranks right up there with Miss Congeniality as one of Sandra Bullock's funniest movies!"
4,A great romantic comedy,"Sandara Bullock is superb as the environmentalist lawyer, Lucy, who is fighting to save historic landmarks. The music that begins the movie, ""You've got what it takes"" and the environmentalist anthem which contains the phrase, ""They paved over paradise and put up a parking lot."" are the best possible choices for this flick. Hugh Grant has some of the best come-back lines ever written into a movie. This is a movie that you don't mind watching more than once."
4,Predictable but fun,"Sandra Bullock plays a lawyer who is passionate in her defense of the downtrodden. She ends up working for wealthy playboy Hugh Grant who is interested only in women and making a profit. Soon their differing ideals begin to clash and Bullock threatens to quit because her job requires her to be on call 24/7 for such monumental decisions as to which tennis outfit Grant should wear to a benefit tournament. The ending is a foregone conclusion, but it's fun getting there and Bullock and Grant manage to throw off just enough sparks to keep things interesting. If you're looking for an evening of light entertainment, this might just be the movie for you."
5,Phenomenal,Who knew Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant could be such a duo?? She had me giggling and hooked on her wit and independent nature. Way to be Sandra!!
2,wrong format,I ordered the widescreen for my wife's birthday and received the full screen. The movie is good but I'm not happy about the error.
1,nothing wrong with the movie,"I downloaded the movie for viewing later. Low and behold when on an airplane, i found that I couldn't view as it hadn't downloaded. Of course once I started the video the 24 hours started so I spent 2.99 for nothing."
5,"Funny, Smart, and Romantic","Two Weeks Notice isn't just another romantic comedy. It's romantic comedy at its best. Hugh Grant is very funny, and perfectly cast as an eccentric, playboy, tycoon. Sandra Bullock is brillant in the role of an idealistic, activist lawyer who goes to work for him as part of a bargain to save a community center. Their romantic chemistry is good, and their comedic chemistry, amazing. It's a lighthearted, clever, feel good movie that never gets stale. The commentary featuring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant is almost as funny as the film itself.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"
5,DVD Transfer Review: 5 Stars! Movie is entertaining too.,"My wife is a big Sandra Bullock fan and we didn't have this one in our video library. We often group movies we want to buy together so they qualify for free shipping. That was the case with this purchase.Unlike at least one other reviewer, we had absolutely no problems at all with the DVD transfer. In fact, when played in a Blu-ray player with DVD enhancing technology, the image was almost as sharp as a Blu-ray. The Dolby 5.1 sound filled the room when played through our sound system. As DVD tranfers go ""Two Weeks Notice"" is one of the best."
1,Awful,"I'm a huge fan of Hugh and Sandra but putting them together was a bad idea, no chemistry whatsoever. The movie was painful to watch it was not even remotely romantic give me ""Notting Hill"" and ""While you were sleeping"" any day Hugh and Sandra are good apart but not together."
3,Better Than Expected,"Caught a sneak of TWO WEEKS NOTICE last night and was surprised I liked it as well as I did. Boy meets girl: girl works for boy: girl leaves boy: boy and girl fall in love. Bullock and Grant have some good chemistry here and the movies sails happily along for 2/3 of the film but the fade ins/fade outs were sloppily handled and the pacing disturbed towards the end. Hugh, a spoiled rich entreprenuer, plays every character he's ever played before (ABOUT A BOY, BRIDGET JONES..., Etc.) and Bullock's character is an extraordinary attorney w/goofball tendencies and an appetite for Chinese food for one. This film has a great soundtrack which helps progress the movie. If you need a ""date"" movie, here's your ticket."
4,Hugh Grant rocks!,"If you're in the mood for a chick flick, then this is the one to see- it's predictable, but it's also extremely humorous. Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock's talents are nicely showcased here, and Hugh often steals the scenes he's in! Men might get annoyed, though, so gather the girls and go see it. I won't give away the plot (it's yet another twist on the girl meets boy theme), but it definitely didn't reflect the rumors that were circulating about the movie's production (tensions between Hugh and Sandra, etc.) Great way to escape for a few hours!"
4,One of the better chick flicks lately.,"Its not surprising that Hugh Grant gets the high marks. After all this is a woman's picture and he has dimples and a British accent. And while I wish her well, Sandra Bullock has more in common with Tyne Daly than Audrey Hepburn.But the real star here is the script which is really quite good. Sure, you know the ending but at least you get to laugh along the way."
3,"Sparklers, not fireworks","Sandra Bullock plays the modern day hippie-lawyer-do-gooder who ends up working for the styrafoam plate loving corporate kabillionaire, hugh Grant, in hopes of making a difference. When time goes by and Bullock realizes she has become Grant's personal wardrobe cooridinator and has not done very much good for the world at all, she gives in her two weeks notice, which causes both to realize how much they really do care about each other.This isn't one of Sandra Bullock's worst attempts *Cough* Murder by Numbers, speed 2, Two if by Sea.... But it certainley isn't the best - Ms. Congeniality, Practical Magic.... The chemistry between her & Hugh Grant is really all that makes the movie watcjable. The writing is on the dull side and the plot is rather predictable. But, Sandra Bullock still remains the queen of cuteness. Worth watching once - who knows, you might actually want to watch it again."
3,A well -acted movie with a terrible script.,"Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant were great in this movie taking every oppurtunity to make it funny. However, the script was pretty bad. I think there could of been some more humor in it around the middle to keep everyones attention. It got a bit boring and then picked up. This really deserved a 3.5Overall: Give it a chance and give it a watch."
3,"Same old, same old...","This isn't the worst movie I've seen in a while, but then again, there's not really anything spectacular about it either.Sandra Bullock portrays a young attorney out to save the world from corporate giants. In the midst of one of her protests, she runs into Hugh Grant, second in command to one of the great developers who is paving over Coney Island. In her efforts to save her beloved community center, Bullock joins Grant as Chief Counsel.After enduring his never-ending demands, Bullock finally throws in the towel, but not before an interesting rivalry begins to develop with her successor. Grant renigs on his promise to save the community center and all appears doomed.In the end, good prevails, and Bullock and Grant re-unite.One of the better scenes in the movie is a party scene where the viewer is treated to the music of Norah Jones.Not the best, but certainly not the worst they've ever done."
2,Two Weeks Nap,"If neither Sandra Bullock nor Hugh Grant (to a lesser extent) can save the thinnest and most damningly simple movie, then it's safe to say that it is indeed junked. Unlike one of the other Mark Lawrence movies featuring Bullock, 'Miss Congeniality,' Bullock doesn't get much of a chance to show off her screwball splendor. Instead, what we get from both leads is a tired effort at replaying what movie audiences love most about them, which is one joke too many and one too lame already. But, if all else fails in a screwball romance, you can at least be assured of eye candy with this pair."
3,Not quite Notting Hill!,"Any film with Hugh Grant has to be a must, however 'Two Weeks Notice' just lacks that something. Sandra Bullock and Hugh are great to watch and there is definitely a strong chemistry, but they should have found a stronger project to work together. If you are after a feel good movie this is it, but there won't be many laughs."
4,Grant Grows Up,"I saw this movie twice because I enjoyed the combination ofGrant and Bullock. At least in this movie, Grant gets outof his stock role of ""Befuddled British Boyfriend"" and finallyplays a more mature character, albeit one who backslides intooccassional silliness with Alicia Witt. Lucy Kelson (Bullock)reminded me of the strong, intelligent female characters in theold romantic comedies , think Katherine Hepburn with a littleof Doris Day's dreaminess.Although the plot was a bit formulaic, setting the movie in ConeyIsland, my old neighborhood, added authenticity and an overall, welcome nostalgia to the whole piece."
2,I already saw this once....,"I gave it two stars and i was being kind. Simply because I saw ""the ring"" and gave it one star and did enjoy it more than that. But this movie is so predictable. Maybe its because I've seen this before. yes it was in ""you've got mail."" Two rich and professional people who in the begining dispise each other while one of them is in a relationship with another. About half way through the protagonist who's in the relationship miraculously drops the 'lover-we-never-see' and realizes how much she loves our other main character. But they save it all for the end with the big ""oh i've always felt this way kiss""Sadly predicatable and loaded with a lot of dry humor, this movie wasn't at all what I expected, it was worse. Sadly, Sandra's 'girl next door good looks' and Hugh's quick oneliners weren't enough to rescue this movie from its date with ...[removed store name]."
2,Disappointment!!,"Sandra Bullock tries the old, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" routine for this movie. This movie was not funny at all. Even with comedian, Robert Klein in a supporting role, it doesn't take off. Hugh Grant is wasted in his role. Overall, this is a dud."
2,Sandra and Hugh Just Were Not On Target,"TWO WEEKS NOTICE was a cute film but missed the mark unlike its predecessor Maid In Manhattan which was more real and entertaining. Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) produced this film as well as stars in it. Her performance although I am sure is honest seemed a little held back playing the Harvard Lawyer fighting for the down-and-under trod.While the other side of the coin, there is the rich millionaire played by Hugh Grant (Nine Months, Notting Hill) was a more outgoing, non-caring and flamboyant wisp that almost didn't match to well with Sandra.It ran a little slow and seemed much more predictable toward the end. Written and directed by Marc Lawrence (Miss Congeniality, Force Of Nature) the movie seemed very slow in pace. Robert Klein (Primary Colors, One Fine Day) gives a standout performance as Sandra's father that is worth noting.This is a good movie for the video and DVD - but theatrically it was a little disappointing. (12-31-02)"
2,Two Weeks To Long,"Being a fan of both Miss. Sandra Bullock and Mr. Hugh Grant I looked forward to what I felt would be a fun movie, unfortunately I was to be quite disappointed.Miss Bullock's character lacked the manic energy she has frequently displayed and that this story badly needed. Her character, Lucy Kelson, had a great deal of potential, which a lackluster performance did not deliver.Mr. Grant's performance was better, but not markedly so. The `one liners' he delivered had little punch and even less humor. The chemistry between the two main characters, necessary in this type film, just didn't seem to be there.The one bright spot was Miss. Alicia Witt, as June Carter, a sort of rival to Miss Bullock's character for the affections of Mr. Grant. Her performance had energy, humor, the vulnerability of youth and at the same time the sense that she was potentially a predator manipulating the situation for personal gain.Bottom line: Even the best miss on occasion and this is one such occasion."
4,Funny with wit and silliness,Two Weeks Notice had humor that definitely made the audience laugh. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant delivered their lines with the right effect that made the movie light hearted. I recommend this movie who wants to see a funny movie this holiday.
2,No Chemistry,"""Two Weeks Notice"" stars two appealing people, but they have no chemistry. My dog and cat have more chemistry. Why would a lawyer (Sandra Bullock) want to work for a conceited billionaire (Hugh Grant)? Greed is a bad thing. Falling in love after countless annoying incidents just makes this movie another routine POS. There was one scene where they were playing mixed doubles in tennis and I was truly ashamed with their athleticism. I could've probably beat all of them with my hand tied behind my back because I'm the king of handicap matches. Oh well. This movie really doesn't grab your attention and makes you wish you spent your money on something with substance, like a twinkie."
5,funny chick flick with great music!!!,"Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock share a chemistry which is witty, believable and funny. If you are a lover of chick flicks, be sure to get this one!The one-liners are hilarious and you will leave this movie with a smile on your face and a tear on your cheek.GREAT music too!!!"
4,hugh grant and sandra bullock are a perfect match...,a delightful romnatic comedy..Hugh Grant plays a very public playboy....sandra bullock is a attonery for the underdog...Hugh grant needs an lawyer and sandra needs hugh's help to save a community center so she works for him thinking it's a great oppurnity..but it soon turns out to be a nightmare when sandra finds herself being more like his servant than his legal advisor..so she gives him his two weeks notice..but they soon find out they have more than just work and friendship in common ...
2,[Weak] but better than Maid in Manhattan,"Let's be honest this is as [weak] a comedy as you can imagine but having said that, Hugh Grant is funny, even with this script and Sandra Bullock is cute. I would never recommend you actually buy this but a rental on an evening when you IQ are asleep and there is nothing else on, then it is okay."
2,could have been a good one,but I don't like Sandra doing her insane bouncing ball impersonation. seen her doing it in several movies and it really gets on my nerve.
2,Great movie - badly produced DVD disk,"Love the movie, but beware of this DVD. 3 times I've ordered it from Amazon (twice in a Slipcase and once in a Keepcase, and all 3 DVD's skipped, the video broke up, scenes kept repeating, etc... And yes, I used the Memorex CD cleaner on the DVD player without any change, and no, none of my numerous other commercially purchased DVD's demonstrate this problem. Two Weeks Notice is the ONLY one. So my suggestion is to stick to the VCR version."
4,"Decent, but typical","This is a pretty decent romantic comedy. Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock create some genuinely funny moments and touching acting. It'll work well for an date with your significant other or if you just want to lift your mood.Unfortunately, like many such films, this film isn't particularly exciting or original. It begins with the characters hating each other, then being forced into a situation where they work closely together, and then near the end of realizing they love each other. In fact, this movie follows the same narrative arc of Sandra Bullock's other romantic comedies, such asThe Proposal. It lacks the spunk and freshness of a film likeMiss Congeniality."
3,Another Cinderella romantic comedy,"The actually chemistry between these two romantic comedy starsis minimal: one doubts Sandra bullock saw anything in Hugh Grant?The music in some cases is better than the dialog( the piano singer at the charity event).This movie is supposed to be opposites attract:in real life these types of people would be murdering each otherif the poor type could get past the rich ones security guards?What is amazing is this ""formula"" film is actually popularwith innocent idealistic girls?"
3,Paint-by-numbers but funny,"The Bottom Line:It's a shame that Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are wasting their talents here on a formulaic and cliched screenplay, for they generate a good amount of chemistry and humor in their interactions as a billionaire and lawyer forced together by loads of contrivance; I can't say that I didn't enjoy watching Two Weeks Notice, but it still saddens me that the film had the capacity to be something noteworthy and ended up as a mild diversion.2.5/4"
2,A review that is a lot like monopoly...,"OK, this review is going to be fairly short. I have to say that this movie could have been great, but unfortunately falls flat at the end. The first half of this movie is great, Hugh Grant is hilarious and Sandra Bullock manages to be cute and intelligent at the same time, and these characters are completely believable. Grant has a line where he says ""My life is a lot like Monopoly"" ( which had me rolling ) and sadly the movie is a lot like Monopoly, in that it is a 'board' game and I found myself very 'bored' in the last half of the movie.This movie is hilarious enough in the first half that I watch just that part then turn it off, because I know what is coming. The last act has them coming together and confessing their love for each other, and at that point it feels completely rushed and unbelievable, like this is the end, so they love each other, ummm, roll credits. I recommend the first half highly, then just skip the rest."
2,And I like Sandra Bullock!,"Sometimes a bubblegum movie is old bubblegum, tired and chewy and not very sweet. This movie has all the pieces but doesn't have any zing to it, any purpose. They go back and forth a little bit but they never truly convinced me that they were in love or their love was in danger. Alicia Witt, a superb actress didn't really have much to do in thsi film and Hugh Grant's bumbling charm boy routine is wearing thin.I'm not sure about Bullock, she's filling a niche I'm sure. Doing films that appeal to her, that she gets paid a lot for, that help employ a lot of people. But I'm not qute sure if she's developing further along as an actress, if she's willing to take a risk and do something edgey or different or challenging. She just seems to be the best at the romantic comedy pairings movie of the season. Hopefully she'll start getting better choices."
2,About Nothing,"Fresh of watching ""About A Boy"" I felt like Hugh Grant could do no wrong, so despite less than stellar reviews I decided give ""Two Weeks Notice"" a shot, which was a mistake. While there are some comedic moments, this a romantic comedy and Bullock and Grant have NO chemistry. In most of the scenes they seem only mildly aware of eachother mostly focusing on thier actions. As a result, I never felt like they should be together. Further, the plot seems to jump around. Right after getting hired, the plot leapfrogs to weeks later where Grant and Bullock are now supposed to be chumy, but I never felt it. THey seem to be tired of eachother and their action forced by the plot's simple-minded purpose. After his great romantic comedies of the 1990s, this a huge step down for Grant and even for Bullock, who mostly makes bad movies anyway. This is not worth your time because it clearly wasn't even worth the actors full attention."
3,"A cute film, although too many like it","All right, I said it. I liked this film, it was cute. Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock have great chemistry. Yet there have been A LOT of ""Cute"" films that have come out that all have the same sort of plot. Two people work together and fall in love. Take Alex and Emma for example. You might just want to stick to renting this one instead."
2,Bullock boring. Even Hugh Grant can't save this movie.,"Hugh Grant does his enjoyable act to perfection in this movie but it is so lacking in story that it's rendered mind-numbing syrup even by romantic comedy standards. The schlock political message they attempt is embarrasing even to liberals.And let's face it, Sandra Bullock is just not a screen beauty, cute maybe, but that nasal voice that not will carry a movie."
4,Great- even if you don't care much for Sandra,"This movie is SO funny! I am not a big Sandra Bullock fan, but nonetheless this was a great show (and if you like her a lot it's probably even better). The writing is extremely funny and Hugh Grant gives his best performance to date. Overall I would rank this as one of the best romantic comedies, right up there with Notting Hill and The Wedding Planner and just below the Princess Bride. My husband liked it too!"
3,Yawn...,"There's nothing really special about this movie...it's such a cliche story and just feels tired and boring. Believe me, I usually love any-and-all chick flicks, but this one just doesn't appeal to me. Pick something else instead."
2,Finding Outtakes,"By activating the ""Two Bleeps Notice"" function in Special Features, you can access the movie outtakes when a small pink heart appears on the screen. If you don't want to have to watch the entire movie, here are the locations of each heart. I think I found them all. These are listed by hour:minute:second. 18:32, 20:04, 23:38, 24:13, 26:38, 28:14, 33:02, 37:28, 41:36, 47:16, 57:50, 1:13:01, 1:24:29.The extras on the DVD are of the usual fare, but not outstanding. The commentary is somewhat interesting, with Sanda and Hugh bantering about. The movie itself is somewhat forgettable, but is an enjoyable little film. I agree with another reviewer who said that it's like iceberg lettuce: not really great for you, but certainly not bad for you either, and you'll forget all about it an hour after it's over."
2,Predictable Fluff,"Nothing worth seeing-- Grant has made some classics in this genre (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary)-- but ""Two Weeks Notice"" is not a classic. It isn't even an admirable effort. It is clear he enjoyed working with Sandra Bullock offscreen, but they share little onscreen chemistry. Bullock continues her title as the ""poor man's Julia Roberts"" -- it's not a harmful film-- it's just not very good."
2,Nothing special,Same story we've seen many times before. You know whats going to happen just by seeing the preview. Grant is great and charming. Bullock is her same old clumsy character. Supporting cast provides laughs as well. All right if you have nothing better to see.
1,*snore* a waste of two good comedic talents,"You would think that a romcom with Bullock and Grant could hardly go wrong.Unfortunately it does in spectacular fashion.Zero chemistry is never a good start in a romantic movie, and two very funny people are let down by an unfunny script.The film feels like it never quite starts - I spent the whole thing waiting for the story to kick in - and then it's over.Very disappointing. I expect the commentary and bloopers are the best reason (if there is a reason!) to buy this movie.Just plain boring - what a shame."
2,A Far Cry From Notting Hill,"I've always been a big fan of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock and I was really looking forward to seeing the two of them together. I sincerely wanted to enjoy myself, but the one thing you heard ALL the critics agree upon about this film turned out to be absolutely true-- It's about as ordinary and unoriginal as a romantic comedy can be. The conflicting question among all the critics was this: Were Bullock and Grant able to turn a rather dull movie into something good? I didn't think so unfortunately. Heck, I don't even think the pairing of Superman and Wonder Woman could have saved this film. It certainly doesn't compare well to Grants previous picture, ABOUT A BOY.My recommendation is not to waste your money on this movie unless you're a fan of these two actors... My final review is two and a half stars... Just too average and not many laughs."
2,Boring romantic comedy,"Sandra Bulluck (who is my favorite actress, by the way) never looked good in this movie and the chemistry between her and Hugh Grant was missing. Neither her character nor Hugh's was particularly like-able and the ending was, of course, predictable, but lacking in real emotion. Wait for cable."
3,Funny yet predictable,"Hugh Grant was charming and funny yes, Sandra was clumsy and cute, exactly what i expected. It was a cute, romantic, funny, movie that offered some laughs here and there, it is a movie that you can just enjoy. However like all romantic comedys, it will end in such a predictable way that you know it from the beginning of the movie. The guy will make a bunch of mistakes but end up getting the girl anyway. I'm not saying I wanted it to end where she rejected him, that wouldn't be any fun, but I am saying that maybe if they would have skipped the whole, dramatic speechs, and kept it funny it would have been more original, and enjoyable.Yet, there is something warm about the movie, but I enjoy the more original ideas in other Sandra movies like While you were sleeping, and Hope Floats. Still she is very good in this movie, its worth renting on DVD, or watching on TV."
4,Great combination...Sandra & Hugh,"According to the tabloids, Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant were not lovey-dovey on the set of Two Weeks Notice. But they certainly did have chemistry when acting together. Their timing was perfect and their characterizations made the movie. Both have wonderful facial expressions and body movements and used these to make the interaction come alive. For fun, laughter and entertainment watch this movie, then watch it again."
4,Quite enjoyable. 17th april 2004.,"Although it is not a brilliant film, i must say i did enjoy it. I have seen better romantic films than this, and on average i would say at least 7 or 8 out of 10 for this film. It does get more romantic towards the end and that is the best part of it because i love romantic films. Although most films arn't brilliant with sandra bullock in, i thought this was a good film you could sit back and watch."
5,Cute little movie.,"This is a very nice, cute little movie. I'm a straight guy and even I like it. It's well made."
3,Mystic Pizza is a good movie.,"Good but by no means great. I am not really a Julia Roberts Fan and it was the fact that this is one of Vincent D'Onofrio's first films that made me watch it. Early on the film drags but about halfway through I began to find it absorbing. My plroblem in the early part was that the three women characters seemed like such airheads that I really did not care what happened to them. I give all three actresses credit for giving performances that kept me fairly interested until the mid-part of the film. There are two surprises at the end of the film that really made me glad I stuck with it. This really is a ""Girl Movie"" and the men in it are mostly wasted. Especially Mr. D'Onofrio. None the less it is worth watching."
1,Boring,"Boring movie, that I mainly remember from when I saw it years ago, because I consciously thought, ""Who is that actress with the long wavy hair? She is so bland and boring, I'm amazed she got cast in this movie. Gosh she is really bland."" Julia Roberts has since become a huge star. But neither my opinion of her--nor this film--has changed a whit."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this movie for my niece, because she loved the movie. When she tried to watch it the movie gave an error message saying it could not be watched in the area. We were all very disappointed about that."
4,A Girl Movie,"This is definately a girl movie because it is all about the lives of 3 girls around 20 or so. I loved the fun they had together. They partied and danced, laughed and played tricks on each other and the guys they were involved with. Robert's character had alot of bravado and spirit. Taylor's was cute and funny, sweet and without anger. Gish's was sensitive and smart. She held back more when the other 2 partied or got crazy. I loved the town of Mystic, Ct. You know there really is a Mystic Pizza. I looked it up and they really have good pizza. It can be ordered frozen through air mail and some stores actually sell it in the eastern states. It sounds absolutely wonderful. My favorite would be the Seafood Delight, with clams and scallops. They even vouch to have the mysterious sauce. The film was based on this tiny restaurant. It has expanded and there are now two. I would like to go to Mystic, it seems like such a neat place to visit.Lisa Nary"
3,This movie is OK,This is an OK movie. I saw it for the first time about 3 years ago and I did not get bored with it. It is not something I would want to watch on a regular basis.
1,BORING,"This film was just stupid. Several friends work in a pizza parlor together, and their lives go in different directions. Julia Roberts in one of her earliest roles, and MY MY MY has she changed. She played a loose, temperamental ""town ..."" who gets involved with a rich guy and has to figure out how to play on his turf (preparation for Pretty Woman, maybe?), Lili Taylor plays a girl who is soon going to marry her long-time boyfriend. She has doubts, but in the end does marry him. Another character (Annabeth Gish, I think) is saving money to go to Harvard (or some Ivy league school) and finds a job as a nanny. The man who hires her is married, his wife is in England or somewhere, and they have an affair. And when the wife arrives, he tries to pretend nothing ever happened. Nothing new about that story. The film tries to show the womens' enduring friendship, but it is all... dull and contrived."
4,Heartwarming Story,There is something magical about this film in its simplicity in examining the needs of the human heart. It is a comedy light in nature but handles its subject very well. It never fails to entertain and continues to draw you in with repeated viewings. Romance can be beautiful and charming and dear to the human spirit.
4,Friendship Forever,"This is a light-hearted story of three childhood friends who experience many ""bumps"" in the road as they come of age. The characters are endearing and interesting. This is an opportunity for all you Julia Roberts fans to see her at the start of her career."
5,FIVE THUMBS UP!!,Mystic Pizza brings you back to the days of getting together with friends and the unbreakable bond of family. This movie is an all-around feel-good romp with a unique twist.
4,"Yeah, it is a chick flick, and yeah, you will love it","A 1989 Julia Robert film. She's one of 3 girls who work at a pizza parlor in Mystic, Connecticut, and each has her own set of guy troubles. Julia, the living-on-the-wild-side, sort-of-slutty townie falls for the slumming rich kid who comes to town; her sister (brainy, headed to Yale on scholarship) falls for a married man; the other one is in love with a big galoot of a local fisherman but just can't make up her mind to commit to marriage. And the fat-momma owner of the pizza place years for the day when the snobbish food critic will show up and sample her wares.Order a pizza, pop the lid off a Pale Ale, kick of your shoes, and sit back for a kick-ass of a movie. It's great."
5,It had to happen,"It had to happen... my wife and I visited Mystic and dined at Mystic Pizza, so when I had the chance I ordered the DVD for $5 on ebay--I was not going to pay $20 for it at the pizzeria! Great movie, especially fun to see a feisty, young Julia Roberts mixed in with other down-to-earth characters made up of a very good cast, and learning life's lessons."
5,Love it,This is a great enjoyable movie. A must see for movie night with the girls. Or just to a nice night at home with some rocky roll ice cream.... lol. I think I'm going to head out to the story for some ice cream right now and watch this movie again!!!! lol
3,RIP GbV,"this is the first guided by voices record i've ever had to force myself to listen to in the vain attempt of having it grow on me. the first few songs are nice enough, but then it devolves into some of the most mediocre songwriting ever put forth by the god of all songwriters. i just don't get it.thankfully, pollard has the wits left to save the best for last. huffman prairie flying field is marvlous. a very nice way to cap off the GbV canon. maybe i'm wrong here, but from a compound eye, pollard's excellent post-GbV debut, sounds much fresher and adventuresome. in the end, who cares what i think. bob has enough material out there that eventually even the most hardcore of fans (i.e.-me) will not love everything he puts out.god bless robert pollard and anyone of the forty (or so) bandmates honored to have played under that nameplate."
3,Goodbye GBV!,"You know how with a lot of GBV albums, you have to listen to them several times before you really ""get it"", or before the music really grabs you? Well, I have listened to this album about ten times through, and I am still not all that enamoured with it. The first three tracks are stellar, especially ""Sleep Over Jack"", which is probably one of the more unique songs Pollard has ever written under the GBV banner. But the second half of the album seems monotonous, with very little to grab the listener. I guess I just expected more from GBV's swansong. But they will always be my favorite rock band. I look forward to more from Robert Pollard's solo career! Thanks for the two decades of great music guys!"
5,The Count is mellow,"One of Basie's big band albums for Pablo, recorded in May 1983, as opposed to the many small group ones he did for that label. Basie is in a mellow mood on this outing, with tempos relaxed or slow. Four of the tunes are blues; SUNDAY AT THE SAVOY is over 12 minutes long and way down home and nice. Eric Dixon (ts), Sonny Cohn (tp), Chris Woods (as) and Booty Wood (tb) are the chief soloist, and Sam Nestico did the excellent arranging. One of Basie's better Pablo recordings, which is saying a lot."
1,"No Freddie, no good.","It is unimaginable to think of a Basie album without Freddie Green, not to mention several tunes with electric bass guitar. This, along with Basie with strings, are among the very very few lousy Count Basie albums. Don't bother with this one. Pablo should be ashamed for releasing it."
1,Never Received,It is difficult to review a CD I never received. Send it to me and I'll give a review. I may give it more than one star when I receive the CDRL Waller
5,Best Waterer Yet!,"I bought the 2.75 Gallon waterer to replace a small 3 litre waterer we had for our 20lb Chinese Crested, Dalmatian puppy, and cat. Needless to say, the 3 litre had to be refilled every two days, and was even light enough for our cat to drag around the kitchen floor when completely full.This waterer was perfect: easy to fill and clean, looks GREAT, and it's way too big and heavy for our cat to move. When filled, it is quite heavy to flip and place into the bowl, but luckily our kitchen sink is deep enough to have the bottle filled in there, so we don't have to carry it far. In addition, we only have to refill it once every week!No issues with any algae (it's kept indoors), no bad tastes or odors, and after a few weeks our pets still LOVE drinking out of it!"
5,Great Waterer for my dogs and cats!,"I don't have anything negative to say about this product. I have a lot of dogs in and out of my home due fostering and the only thing that has happen is a young lab got the bottle off when it was empty and chewed the end of it.. But now the faucet sits nicely on when filling up the bottle due to the chew marks .. Its also pretty heavy when full and transporting back and forth..You will want to make sure you clean it every month, it can get slimy fast but otherwise for the price and convenience of this product I give five stars!"
4,Great product but gets moldy with age,"I love this water dispenser! I have an 82 pound lab who gets very thirsty sometimes, so it's nice to not have to constantly refill a bowl of water, and with the 5 gallon bottle, I usually refill it every 3 days or so.However, I've been noticing more and more lately things floating in the water bowl, and the inside of the bowl (where the water from the jug initially goes) is lined with black (I'm suspecting mold/bacteria). I have cleaned it (even ran it through the dishwasher) and while it cleans it, I have to clean it all over again a few days later. I've had it about 2.5 years now, so maybe it's time for another one? And I've noticed in the jug itself, black spots, and well, good luck trying to clean those out.I will probably just buy another one, 2.5 years is a good investment."
3,"Works well, but the bowel lasts a lot longer than water bottle","The water bottle is too flimsy for the price, although there are not good alternatives. Once the bottle breaks, we just replaced it with a regular water cooler bottle."
5,It's awesome!,"FINALLY! I don't have to constantly fill the water dishes! Yay! Now it's once a week... maybe a little longer. I have 1 extra large dog and 1 large dog. They drink a lot of water! This item is awesome, no regrets. REALLY EASY to clean. Even my cats use it. Great buy all three way around. I'm thinking about getting a second for outside in the backyard for when I'm gone for awhile (they always knock over the current out door one)"
4,Great dispenser easy to upgrade!,"I have had this water bowl for 2 years and it works great. However the bottle easily breaks but it was too small anyways. I swapped out the 1 gallon bottle with one of those 5 gallon ""Arrowhead"" bottles and it is perfect for my thirsty 100+lbs Kangal. Though it utilizes an anti-microbial plastic it is still not algae proof. So if you use it outdoors, make sure you change it often.Pros:-strong enough for 5-gallon bottle swap-bleach safe (easily cleaned with a 10% bleach soak)-2+ years outdoors with no UV damage-MicrobanCons:-original bottle is easily cracked"
2,Great waterer but hard to clean,"This water dispenser works just fine and my dogs have no problem drinking from it. I have a problem with cleaning it, however. I keep it outside and in the summer months, it will develop a green mold or algae inside the jug and also in the bowl. Since there is only the small narrow spout for an opening, there is no way to get any kind of brush in there to clean it. I ended up having to soak it in bleach water to remove the green stuff inside."
1,Poor quality bottle,"Be prepared to replace the weak plastic bottle within a year. Oh, yeah, you can't buy a replacement bottle, you have to buy a whole new unit!"
3,I wish the bottles held up longer.,"I now have 6 Bistro bases because I have burned through 6 bottles. They crack very easily - even when they are used strictly indoors. I had purchased all six of of my LeBistros on eBay and the eBay store owner led me to believe that it is not possible to purchase replacement bottles. We recently did an internet search and found a source called PetMate and I have already ordered my first replacement bottle. I don't mind having so many bases because I regularly rotate them while the dirty ones get sanitized in the dishwasher. It is also important to regularly clean and bleach the bottles so your dogs will not develop an infection from algae deposits. For all of its faults (heaviness, lack of longevity), LeBistro is still the best dog watering dish I have found. I have three full-size, active labs and I would have to otherwise fill their water dish way too often."
2,Good for when you're on vacation but not for all the time use,"I started off using this as the primary water dish for my pets, however within a very short amount of time, I'd have to dump out all the water to clean it because a nasty, clear slime would start growing in the dish-YUCK!I decided to start using a pet water fountain as their primary water source, because it's constantly moving and there's a filter, it stays clean a bit longer.However, this is great for cats, if you're away on vacation. But, because of the slime factor, I don't like to use this unless I have to."
3,its ok not that sturdy but ok for my yorkie,the plastic doesn't seem that sturdy and the construction is so so especially where the top half and lower half of the plastic pieces meet. The bottle is ok with a very small neck so the water doesn't come gushing out. but its good for the money. I have a small 5 lb yorkie and its ok for small dogs like him. bigger dogs may tip it over. not a bad deal
5,Petmate LeBistro,"I bought this as a replacement for the same. I have a Shih Tzu and English Bulldog and it is big enough for both. It lasts a long time. Do Not put it in the dishwasher though, it's too hot and will melt the plastic over time."
4,Pet waterer,This is a great product for anyone with a small dog or cat for access to water when they need it and fresh. I use filtered water from my refrig & the bottle has a small neck that fits. I still wash it every so often because of dog food & small amount of film gets on the sides just a little after several weeks.
3,"OK, not great",I wanted a matching set of feeder/waterer for my cat. The waterer came apart at the bottom when I went to clean it. Other wise it is fine.
2,"Great concept, but. . .","This waterer is a great concept, but does have some drawbacks. For starters, one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work. The first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it. The other dog is just fine with it, but then again he's deaf, so the gurgle doesn't bother him. lol. The other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls, it gets dirty. so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl, but it's a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off, clean the bowl and but the jug back on. So, if your dog isn't afraid of the noise it makes and you don't mind the extra hassle cleaning it, it's great. Otherwise, just get a large bowl; that's what i ended up having to do."
2,Does not keep algae away...,"While it functions great as a pet waterer, the Microban does not work very well. We have to clean it every time we fill it (used with dogs). It is only a few months old and will get green over several days. We contacted the company and got virtually no support--just a note that we may need to clean it occasionally. No kidding. That's what we told them. So good waterer, terrible customer support, and does not stay clean very well."
3,"Works as described, but pet won't use it!","This works well, and holds a large amount of water compactly. But my dog refuses to drink out of it! I think she prefers fresh water, and the surface of the water starts to collect dust and particles quickly."
3,"Great capacity, but heavy and awkward to refill","Hold a week's worth of water for my two dogs and three cats who drink so much water. The basin is easy to clean, but the bottle isn't. I can only wipe around the inside neck of the bottle; that's all I can reach. Also it's super heavy when full of water and awkward to turn over and place right-side-up without spilling any water. The jug needs some sort of hand-hold or handle to make it easier. Nonetheless, I got it for the water capacity and it does work."
1,very cheap design,"the water bottle easily falls off, the top portion of the dispenser will pop off. great for a small dog, not good for a medium or big dog. Dog easily accidentally knocks the water bottle off and when that happens the top part of the dispenser is dislodged."
1,Difficult if not impossible to clean!,I used this for a couple of months for my two Brittany Spaniels. It worked fine in every aspect EXCEPT one of the most important -- I couldn't clean the inside of the bottle which started growing a slimy film near the opening. I threw it out and purchased the product by PetSafe and am MUCH happier with it.
2,I agree with others -- water bottle too fragile,"As others have noted, this system works exceedingly well up until the time that the bottle develops a crack -- & make no mistake, the plastic used for the bottle is so brittle that it will eventually crack if it is even slightly mishandled. The ""antibacterial"" aspect could be better as well. I have had some success in using RTV to seal cracks, but eventually you're going to have to replace the unit."
5,Good Buy,"Durable and does a good job. Aftyer purchasing and using the first one, I bought three more. That should tell you they are worth the $$$"
3,water bottle cracks very easily,We had this unit about 6 months. After about 2 months the bottle developed a small crack and then a few months later developed a huge crack. Evidently you can't buy a replacement bottle.
4,"My kitties like it, but it's too light","For whatever reason, my kitties seem to enjoy drinking from the Le Bistro waterer more than from their water dishes. Maybe it's the novelty. I do think it will be a good solution for supplying them with fresh water when I'm away.It *is* a bit on the light side, though. I put mine in a narrow space between a cabinet and a wall, to make sure they don't use it as a toy and slide it all over the floor.Update: I stopped using this after finding it one morning tipped over with water all over the floor. It's just too light for a young, playful cat."
1,Foul tasting water - dogs refuse to drink from it,"I have had this for about a month and have two 50 pound dogs that go through about 5 gallons a week. Seemed like a good fit for this bottle (note that the pic is of the 5 gallon dog food dispenser and not the waterer). Well, within a day or two of using it the dogs refused to drink from it. I pulled the bottle and poured a glass of water from it and it tasted awful. The plastic leaches chemicals into the water and the dogs wanted nothing to do with it. They drink out of some of the most rancid puddles and mud holes and they wouldn't touch this water. I can only use this dish without the bottle attached for them to use it. I would only suggest this for someone with enough dogs to empty it daily - otherwise the chemical taste of the water will get too strong."
1,review of Bistro Warter,I am not happy with this water as it needs to be cleaned daily for the bottom and you need a babby bottle brush to clean the water reservor or you will get slime collecting in the bottle and in the wattering area where your cat drinks. The scum will not make your can sick but after getting 2 drinkwells I will never go back to a Bistro water!
4,Agree that smaller would be better,"I have 4 cats and find that if I fill this more than halfway the water gets discolored before it's time to refill. My cats like to play in it getting scum and food in the water so it needs to be cleaned at least once a week. It's a great product, and I don't mind filling it halfway, however it would have probably made more sense to get the smaller one. I would also suggest that the food and water are kept a good distance from each other to help keep the water clean. It is not fun to clean it while it's still full. As for the 'gurgleing' it is not a major problem with cat's since they don't drink as much as dogs it rarely happens while they are standing there. When it does they either run off and come back later or they try to play with it."
2,Bottom part broke,"Brand new and bottom broke. very expensive as well. Too bad I cannot send back. I had it for alot of animals outside. My chicken coop caught winter electrical fire, so bottle got burnt anyway."
1,Confusing photo,"The photo shows one waterer and a feeder,when you order you'll getone waterer only which is the same as written description but you feelcheated if you order by the photo and expecting both."
1,Never Again!,"If I could rate this lower than one star, I would! I received a petmate le bistro feeder some months ago. I couldn't use it immediately because of a medical condition of one of my cats. A month ago I took it out of the box, programmed it and was very satisfied for about two and a half weeks. Then it stopped working. I put in new batteries (even though the ones in it should have still been good). I tried to reprogram it and it does not work. I went on the internet to find an e-mail address for Petmate Le Bistro, but there is none. I tried to call the 800 number that is listed. I was on hold for 45 minutes and then I lost patience. It is good for nothing and I will junk it. I am certainly not going to wait even another 5 minutes for that company to answer the phone. Thank you for letting me review this very expensive product that certainly does not work from a company that couldn't care less."
3,Looked like it was a winner,"I purchased this in order for my cats to have enough water while I am away. The first time I put this out, my cats knocked the water container off the base and water was everywhere. Thinking that this was just a fluke, I tried again. Same thing happened. I must now think of some way to keep the water container on the base, so that the cats won't continue to knock it off. It simply sits on the base without locking in to place. If there were some way to lock the water onto the base, it would be a great product. I didn't have a problem filling the water container."
2,Great Start - Intermittent Performacne,"I bought the LeBistro Portion Control Feeder and for the first 12 feeding times at breakfast and lunch it worked like a champ. Then it stopped delivering meals. Fortunately I was aware of it - I bought it for when we went away for weekends, but wanted to be sure the cat wouldn't starve while we were gone so set it up to feed. The Waterer I bought is fine. It's just a little water cooler. I wish it were a little more solid though.Back to the Feeder - I had to reset the whole thing twice before it worked. I had the right times and portions but just didn't drop the food. I'm going to give it another week or so before I ask to have it replaced.When it works it's great - good design for the cost. Pretty easy to set up.But intermittent behavior defeats the purpose of being able to leave with confidence."
4,ok,good service could have used a better product description. a bit if a problem using a water filter.
3,"Fair, but Could be a lot better...should choose another shipping method!!","The Waterer was okay, a bit difficult to fill up and then flip over into the bin. Would be better if had an opening at the top to fill as it is already in position. However, the major problem I had, was the shipping of the item was the WORST!!! I had purhased this item, as I was going on vacation for a week and wanted my 2 cats to have plenty of water, and at the last minute I had to go out and buy another watering system, because there was a HUGE dent in it that would not come out. It was nearly crushed in half. I did contact the seller and I was offered to return it to them and I would receive a credit less the shipping cost, however, the cost of returning it through UPS (seller's choice) and the extra effort was not worth returning the item. I would have only got about 50% of the amount I paid back from the seller."
2,Impossible to clean,"I used this waterer for several months. I had always rinsed it out with fresh water before refilling it, and scrubbed the bottom part. Within 2 days, the bottom part would always start growing an orange slime on it, and I smelled the plastic water-holder part, and it smells like algae (although none is visible). I feel awful for using this product for my cat, and have switched to a regular bowl that I can thoroughly clean daily. I am only keeping the automatic water dish in the event I'm away a day or two. Other than that, DO NOT USE FOR DAILY WATER."
4,How do you clean the bottle?,"My dogs have been enjoying this water bowl for about two years. We need to fill it about twice a week. The issue is cleaning it. If it is not cleaned thoroughly, it will grow algae in unreachable areas of the 5-gallon jug, especially along the ridged areas. I have been using a wired, bendable brush that I insert changing the shape of the wire as needed to reach different areas. However, the brush isn't long enough to reach down to the bottom ridges. Can Amazon or any readers suggest a longer, wire-twisted brush with a handle no less than 12"" long. I haven't been able to find one. Otherwise, we think it's a convenient way to water the dogs!"
5,fantastic water dish,"I bought this because i have a dog and cat who hang out outside all the time. I was tired of refilling the water dish. This is just the perfect size. Not too big, not too small."
4,LeBistro Waterer,We got the five gallon size and found out that the water bowl was getting dirty after about two or three days(After some detective work we discovered that the cat likes to wash his paws in the water!) So now we just fill it halfway and it's much easier to remove the water reservoir and clean the bowl. So far no mold has built up and overall we are pleased with the product. It fits easily in the corner with the dog's food bowl and alleviates our worry about the dog running out of water while we are at work during the day.The construction is ok and so far we have had no issues with the unit.
4,Great for multi-pet households.,"I agree with others who remarked that the size can make the tank awkward to handle. I like to filter my pets' water, but bc of its size I am forced to use tap water from my tub. I do have some rescue dogs. I adopted my long haired chihuahua in the summer of 2007 and noticed he did not drink much even though it was quite warm. I lated learned that he was afraid of the gurgling noise! (This from a 5 pound chi who wants to take on dogs many times his size). He did eventually acclimate to the sound it makes. For customers who are purchasing ANY waterer like this for first time, I would suggest making an alternate water source available - such as a bowl - until you are certain your pets will drink from it. All in all, this is a great product that can be very beneficial as long as you monitor your pets' intake initially."
3,Messy,"Pros: Good idea. Holds water.Cons: Messy. Guess what the dog will do when he is bored. Dispenses too much water. amount should be more shallow. For some reason it leaks around the outer edges. They are not sealed. Maybe for overflow reasons or for the thing to breathe, but why all around?F- for designA+ for idea"
3,not bad -- not good,"small bowl causes splash over with bigger dogs. Design is on the chintzy side. But, it does serve a gallon of water in a fairly reliable manner"
2,NOT FOR YOUNG CATS/KITTENS,"My new cat 4 mo. old could see bottom of spout-nipple-water exit point and kept reaching in to pull on it,leading too a huge mess as it then pawed at the water in the bowl as i guess it was it the way.digging might better explain as it threw the water out of the tray/pan onto the floor as fast as it could (yes it is now funny).Only saying so because last one only had a small hole for water to come out of into pool/drinking area.Only needed a new bottle but was just as cheap to get new assembly.re-inventing the wheel in this case did not work with my cat who has now become bored with it and finally just drinks out of it.hope this helps."
1,The archtype of the acuser in full force,"Jung presents an interesting view of the book of Job, picking up on Job's affirmation that he doesn't deserve what's been dealt to him. But this book should be seen as mearly Jung's perception of the book, and as a reaction to a religion of Law, and not of Grace. He bases his interpretations on misquotations of the Bible and the apocrypha. I guess every power figure, even God, gets his words misrepresented in print."
4,My answer to the Answer to Job,Amazing well written book on one of the most powerful books in all of literature. Possibly the finest peace of classic literature is the Book of Job and Carl Jung breaks the book down and analyzes all of its pitfalls and shortcomings in how it shows the way you relate to Yahweh to the way it shows how we relate to our own lives. For anyone that loves the Book of Job you should read this.
4,A very dense yet interesting book,This short book took me a while to read it because the subject matter is fairly dense. He directly addresses the paradox between the wrathful Jehovah and loving Christ. It treats the subject more literally than I expected - I couldn't tell whether he was talking about an inner dynamic or literal historical events. This might turn some readers off.I come from a Christian background and it addressed some questions I still had from my childhood about the split personality between the Jehovah of the Old Testament and the New Testament Christ.
2,"For a man his age, he sings great.","This album was originally released in 1968, when Regis was Joey Bishop's sidekick. It was Regis's only commercially released album, although he later recorded some albums that he released on his own. Regis had an okay singing voice, but it was certainly nothing special. Also, his style was hopelessly outdated by 1968. The arrangements of these standards are incredibly corny, too. But a few of these songs are good for a laugh. The highlight of the album is the end of ""Toot, Toot, Tootsie/Baby Face"", where Regis yells out ""Sock it to, 'em, Tootsie!"". Now, that's (unintentional) comedy!"
1,A duet with Kathie Lee would be the topper,At least this album is better than Kathie Lee's.Then again the white noise of a static channel is better than her ill fated forays into music.Get it as a Christmas gag gift for someone with a sense of humor.
3,Got better from second season onwards,"I began watching Six Feet Under in the second season, but did not realise that it was the second season. This is because in Australia, they started it from the second season (stupid decision!).Anyway, when the chance came along to snatch up the First series on DVD at a reasonable price, I grabbed it. I assumed I would love it as much as Season 2 and Season 3. Not the case. The first season is rather dull in comparison, and I guess we should expect that as there is alot of time spent developing main characters.Trust me, ""Six Feet Under"" really started coming to life (excuse the pun) in the second season where it was totally absorbing and I craved the next episode.Pass on Season 1, save your money and invest in Season 2 and Season 3."
2,What's with the price tag?,As much as I love the show - I find the price of this DVD collection to be insane!
1,ripped off,Seller claimed to be selling the complete season of Six Feet Under. I received the 4th disc of the first season. DVD was in bad shape. Not satisfied.
5,Great series. Too much $$.,"It is unfortunate that HBO hasn't researched the market for the going rate of episodic television programs on DVD. While I love ""Six Feet Under"", and have anxiously been awaiting the DVD set, I will have to re-think whether or not I can afford to shell out [$$$] for 13 episodes."
3,CLOSED CAPTION GLITCH - NEED RESPONSE,"We purchased the entire series package and find that on Season I, the closed captioning is ONLY in Spanish. The packaging lists that it is only in Spanish. All other seasons list English, French, Spanish. Is this true of ALL Season I disks? It's Sunday, and I can't get any resolution from the store where they were purchased. Would rate it FIVE Star rather than three if it didn't have this problem!"
5,"Perfect condition, fast shipping!","Easy to purchase, arrived promptly and was in good condition. Can't ask for anything more!"
5,One of my favorite shows,"If incase you don't have cable and you've heard of this show but are too scared to buy it. Let me tell you, you will not regret it. This show is so honest it's kinda scary but in a good way if you know what I mean. The charecters and the plots are so deep. You'll end up buying the other season's or ordering cable."
2,Box was broken,I wasn't able to give the actual box for the dvd as part of the gift because the top was ripped off. The status was that it was just like new. This is not just like new if the box is broken. Otherwise the dvds look great and not scratched.
5,Great product,"Fantastic box set. Original in every aspect, even factory sealed. No bootlegs here. Arrived in a timely matter around the holidays."
5,Pleased.,"I thoroughly enjoyed the gathering that occupied Alan Ball's world of Six Feet Under. And the perspective he gives on two commentary tracks gives insight into the thoughts and feelings human nature puts on display. I work as a paramedic in a rather large south florida community, and meet briefly with large numbers of people inside a week. I can attest to how people interact with one another without understanding why. Ball does an excellent job in capturing that. And the fact that he gives credit to those around him concerning the development and layers of the lives of the Fisher family and those who orbit their existence, in capturing a unique window into what it is like to have flaws, shows how great a film maker he is. He shows that we try and make the best of what we own the most...our lives. Thanks Alan."
5,Sublime,"We have just finished up the DVD release of Season One; we broke a number of records with this series:1) first time I have reserved a title at the video store, and anxiously awaited ""the call"" to say it's in!2) first time we have cleared an evening to watch 5 hours of a show3) first time we have ever considered purchasing TV show episodes for our DVD library...move over, Harry Potter!4) first time we have ever decided to subscribe to a TV network just for the sake of ONE show...HBO's Six Feet Under5) first time I have ever longed for the DVD release of a season of episodes..."
2,six feet under first season,"so far, still watching the first season. But can tell you that by only watching the first show i would give the season a 2. the first show of any season should grab your attention, and they do that but they just dont do a very good job at keeping it. In the first show, theres death, closet ""hook ups"", gay soft core love scenes and just plain drama, wonder what the rest of the shows are going to be like. If you are into the slow paced ironic drama then this show is for you."
1,Overrated and Uninspiring,"At first promising, this series quickly unwinds because the characters are not particularly interesting. Because of this, the writers choose to insert one bizarre situation or tragedy after another in order to give the characters something new to complain about.Not any of the characters acts like the adults that they are supposed to be, and not one of them is aware of the simple truth that if you're miserable, being in a lousy relationship isn't going to cure you of being miserable. The Gay Sex Death Hour is neither funny, witty, or poignant, and your money would be better spent elsewhere."
1,"Cutesy, content-free","The Amazon staffer who compared it (on the DVD page) to a cross between Twin Peaks and Family was dead on. Because it's cutesy and content-free on the one hand, sentimental and melodramatic on the other. Most of the actors/actresses look like models and can't act, the supposedly ""mysterious"" Brenda is just another cliche, and the insistent soundtrack is a nausea-inducing combination of Rick Marvin Air Pudding and K-Tel hits. This mix might be ""addictive"" for some, but then again so is heroin.Look, I'm someone who believes that TV CAN be great art. A cross between, say, Barney Miller and, The Outer Limits might be more to my liking. But this bucket of suds? Forget it."
4,Six feet under - complete first season,"Such a highly addictive series!I am not really a big watcher of series type shows, but this one caught me with the first episode and kept me hooked.Can't wait for season 2! Even considered ordering HBO just for six feet under ...It's content can be pretty rough at times (bordering on graphically shocking) BUT once you get past that; and the colorful language, you are left with pure laugh out loud comedy with surprises along the way."
5,Best season of six feet under!,This is the beginning of one of the best HBO series out there!after u see this season u will hardly be able to wait to see the second one! I enjoyed it immensly!
2,DVD release not on BluRay,"This isn't as much a review as much a question. Are they releasing Season 1 again next month but not on BluRay, why???"
2,Meh,"Based on the other reviews, I am in the minority. This series just didn't do anything for me. I never got into the characters or even felt like i couldn't wait for the next episode. I don't know what it was, it was just boring. I never watched past the first season so i don't know if it got better or what but there is just better shows out there."
5,Entertaining!!!,"The acting is real, the story is real. It could happen anywhere to anyone. Its not just a soap opera, its real life. I can't wait until the second season comes out."
3,unsure if I would recommend,It took awhile to get to like the characters. I am warming to them now that I am in the last disc of season one. They are so dysfunctional and difficult to relate to. I will probably try season 2 & see how it goes
3,Another Grainy Mess from HBO,I loved Six Feet Under ever since the first season. But what I don't understand is why the episodes I recorded on TiVo look better than the ones that come on this DVD...
5,Thumbs up!,"Who would have thought that a series about death could be so engrossing and entertaining? But this ingenious show captivates the viewer in the first episode (and doesn't let go!) with excellent actors who portray complex, believable characters. Each episode speaks to the human condition with a combination of humor, sensitivity and, of course, the element of surprise. And isn't that what life and death are all about?"
4,Thank you,"Have not had the chance to watch yet, but it was downloaded successfully and without any troubles...Thank you very much."
4,"""Something..different""","I was a bit skeptical when i first heard of this show, soap opera plots?, talking dead people ? come on.But as i kept watching, there was always something memorable about an episode from Richard Jenkins making appearences as the brothers dead father or the goody two shoes brother played by Michael C. Hall (Dexter)and other interesting characters The acting is excellent and the main theme title intriguing. Im not gunna say anymore, there is no middle ground with a show like this, its either you love it or hate it. If you saw ""American Beauty""(one of my favorite movies) you might appreciate this show a bit more. If the show keeps up with the good story, count me in for season 2. In other words the season was in the mail when i got home wrapped in plastic and in 100 percent perfect condition. If i do decide to stick around for season 2, im ordering it off Amazon."
1,What a joke,"If i were to use a simon cowell quote id say this cd is, ""DREADFUL"" I honestly dont know what Geoff was thinking. This is a pathetic attempt of a cd."
1,What a joke,to quote simon cowell...DREADFUL ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL. Worst attempt at music i've ever heard. I guess the music gene didnt get passed to him
5,Kingdoms Review -eels-,"A man called e and Abroken toyshop are profoundly astonishing and origanal albums. Following are three more adversly fantastic epics - Beautiful Freak, electro shock blues & daisys for the galixy making up an altogether complete collection. Phase by phase of E's Life is remarkably reflected throught your musical collection of one of the most origanal and alive artists of today."
3,"Good, but disappointing compared to other E/Eels works","After listening to A Man Called E and the three Eels CDs, I was expecting a bit more out of this E offering. Don't get me wrong, it is a good album... some of the tracks are very good listening, with very strong lyrics. My favorites are The Only Thing I Care About, LA River, A Most Unpleasant Man (the highlight of the album), Someone to Break the Spell, and My Old Raincoat. However, many of the tracks don't really stand out at all... the music is too dismal and the lyrics too bland. Shine It All On, Standing At the Gate, Mass, She Loves a Puppet, and Eight Lives Left were especially disappointing. So while the album's good tracks are very enjoyable, the bad tracks detract from the experience significantly when you compare this album as a whole to other E/Eels stuff. I'd recommend A Man Called E and either of the first 2 Eels albums far more than I'd recommend this."
2,"Not bad, but....","This book gives good coverage of Oracle's JDBC implementation. That is about as far as it goes. This is just too close to being documentation. When purchasing books on a specific technology, I am looking for the author's insight. Specific things the author learned while working with it. Give me best practices, suggestions, things to avoid, etc. Tell me what I won't learn from Oracle's docs, don't just rewrite them."
4,Quite revealing and very helpful,"Having just completed Bales' book, I found that it provided answers to a number of things that were previously only ""fuzzy"" in my knowledge in terms of applying the JDBC to the Oracle world. His explanation of the different forms of connections clarified quite a lot.Likewise, the numerous references to the ""thin driver"" and the banchmark figures revealing that it was either close to or exceeded the performance of the OCI driver was another eye opener (and enhanced the portability of my Oracle/JDBC code).The examples are all comprehensible and they really do work. It's obvious the author thought these through and tested them.The only drawback (and it's covered by the author in the preface) is that examples and pathing presume a Windows platform -- in spite of his preference for Unix. That can be forgiven..and it only cost a single star in this review. :-)"
4,Very good book to read,"I really like the book, though its content is rather outdated. It's a good start for any one considering a job as a Java developer."
3,Not bad,"Overall, this isn't a bad book, but I only rate it a 3 because I found the structure of the book confusing. It also only covers the Oracle8i database, not Oracle9i, which was disappointing."
4,good old school British death metal,"This album is refreshing in its straight-forward brutality. Bolt-Thrower have definitely managed to keep their breed of death metal alive, and with the return of Karl Willetts to the line-up, it has certainly meant a return to form for many loyal fans.This album is heavy. The riffage is thick, and the drums are pummeling (especially on the faster tracks). I'll be honest and say that I prefer the faster tracks, but the slower ones are still good and are meaty in a way that only Bolt-Thrower know how to do. 'Those Once Loyal' is a hefty slab of old school death metal, and provides a nice alternative once in a while to all the crazy tech death metal going on these days..."
5,"after eight releases, these guys are still going strong","Bolt Thrower is more than Death Metal. it is time tested war metal that has no intention of mellowing out. they have eight or nine releases under their belts, and they're still going strong. keep it up! I hope they release another album."
4,Cute and Quirky But No Turkey,"Jad who? I hear you ask. Well, the lyricist and singer on this quirky collaboration with the Scotchy guitar poppers is an obscure offbeat American musician and visual artist whose approach to painting and music is basically one of child-like innocence. The cute cover art is therefore a good indication of what to expect inside.Sounding like a candy-store Lou Reed, Jad Fair talks-more-than-sings his screwball cartoon lyrics against TFC's excellent musical backing. Just like when we were age 11, Frankenstein and Superman constantly get name checked.Once the mild irritation factor wears off, you realize that it's actually very effective, as on the rocking ""Crush On You,"" where Jad sings: ""Well, if your looking for a love song/ you've come to the right place."" Or the hilarious ""Always In My Heart,"" where he admits, ""I might not be a Beatle/ but I've got needs like a Beatle/ All I need is love."""
3,"Derivative, but has its guilty pleasures","Yes, Pino Donaggio's lush, wicked score is worth the price ofadmission, and DePalma does pull some great technical punches in twokey sequences ladled with Donaggio's strings and synthesizers. The Frankie Goes to Hollywood porno shoot is fun and ingenious. But does it all add up? Almost, but not really. The climax is contrived and implausible. DePalma does provides some comic glimpses into the backside of show biz - high and low - that will be appreciated by veterans or current employees. Nevertheless, the film, thematically, is all over the place, and never as concise as Hitchcock, and it is - in the end - Pino Donaggio's fine score that holds it all in place."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:Oh sure Body Double is fun to watch--DePalma is nothing if not entertaining--but it's an unbeleivably contrived picture that doesn't even attempt at plausibility as it moves towards its convoluted climax.
5,"Not as good cover, but better presentation","I always loved the cover for the other version of Body Double, but this version, even though the cover has been ""modernized,"" has the widescreen version and some special features. The other version lacks these features. Why would I watch this movie on full screen when this version is better on Widescreen? One of my favorite movies easily"
3,"""Why is this movie such a guilty pleasure?""","This film rides the parallel rails of suspense and sarcasm. DePalma offers the viewer classic movie techniques (ie.Hitchcock) with a modern twist (ie.porno movies). Mabye it's just me but I find that after multiple viewings (over the years),this movie seems to get better with age. Also, fact or fiction: people who consider DePalma a rip off artist should look at Tarantino's work, especially the title for his first film. When you see Body Double's ending figure out how Tarantino came up with the title for his first movie. Bark bark."
3,Brian De Palma,An unemployed actor is asked to house sit at an apartment. He sees a woman stripping in a bedroom who later gets killed. Another man is spying on him. He meets a porn star who is key to the case. Not bad for a rental thiller.
3,Nice copy but ?,"Is this really a 'wide Screen' version ? It is a 16/9 image,but not a 2.38 as it should be"
1,Don't waste your time or money on this one,"As a comedy it would be dramatically bad but as a drama it is laughable. Ridiculous plot, bad acting, the works!"
2,A thriller that could've been better,"A look at the DVD cover conveys a message to the red blooded male that when seeing this movie you will be seeing some skin. If that's all you're looking for then you'll give it a higher rating than I have. I found disappointment as the story had potential but hindered itself by taking avenues from reality to far fetched situations without needing to. There is some suspense, and enough skin to keep it away from the kids, but overall it missed it's potential."
1,Salty,"I expected more. I was extremely dissatisfied with the content of this movie. The story line was poor and an obvious duplicate of Alfred Hitchcocks' ""Rear Window"" - with a raunchy twist. I do not advise anyone to waist their money on this product."
1,this may well be the worst thriller made in the 80's,i can't even begin to tell how bad this movie is. it just rolls around in its own excess and asked us to play stupid and just follow along. i sold this one the day after i bought it.
1,"NOTHING, BUT A CHEAP PORNO REMAKE OF ""VERTIGO""!","This movie is just horrific! it made me sick. Brian De Palmajust took ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear window"" and turendit into a porno flick. Nothing can be worst than this cheap ""Vertigo"" imitation! Don't waste your money on this stupid film! Trust me! END"
1,POSSIBLY THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE (Really),"Don't listen to the other reviewers. This movie is a new low in cinema -- I don't care that it is violent or exploitative or anything like that -- it is simply dull, badly made, laughably written, and a complete waste of your time. The ONLY nice part is that Melanie Griffith is not yet the puffy drunk plastic surgery victim she now is -- so it is interesting to see for that aspect alone. But wow, this movie is a complete loser."
3,"Worth a try, but too insubstantial to be a classic","""Body Double"" certainly has a few memorable scenes - if a movie as voyeuristic as this didn't, then it would get a one-star rating. Difficult to figure out if Brian de Palma isn't perhaps parodying himself as well as Hitchcock - there is a thread of humor through the movie that makes it hard to regard it as a real suspense thriller. Not one to raise your hopes high for, but worth a go."
5,Original soundtrack now available!,I've been after the complete soundtrack for ages! The complete score has been released by Intrada.com - Official release and limited to 3000 copies - hurry!
4,"DVD is fullscreen, not widescreen","The DVD actually contains a cropped fullscreen version of the film, not the original widescreen version.[...] Body Double is currently only available in a fullscreen version.My 4-star rating is for the film, not the DVD."
2,Stumbling block,"Aside from anything else that is good or bad, routine or entertaining about this film, I can't be the only one who was completely unable to get past the fact that, in the big murder scene, both the hero and the victim act more stupefyingly idiotic than any characters in the lowest-grade teen slasher ever made."
2,Which film did some of you people see?,"Because I KNOW you didn't see any amazing acting, incredible plot twists or X-rated sex scenes in Body Double. This film is watchable if nothing else is on; I'll give it that. But ""gripping?"" ""DePalma's masterpiece?"" ""a classic?"" Only if you took a LOT of drugs before you saw it. It's typical DePalma; in other words, a Hitchcock ripoff he manages to make a few notches above putrid."
3,not that bad,"I could hardly wait to see this movie, having so much heard about it. the truth is that i was a little bit disappointed, 'cause you know from the start who the murder is. the main actor is a pretty boring man (i know why he didn't make it in Hollywood), and the film has no rythm. Only Melanie Griffith is worth seeing (a great influence on '86 Madonna's look).that's all folks,R.+ S."
4,"OK, so it's not Hitchcock","DePalma's middle finger to feminists and other critics who decried his abuse of female characters. To get the joke is to appreciate the movie fully. On the other hand, feminists and humans in general should have been outraged not by the power drill, but by (1) the cheesy makeup on the villain, (2) Shelton's entire performance, and (3) the knack DePalma has for derailing his story's momentum just before the end. (He did it in Blow Out, his best movie, also.) See it uncut. The final shot, which of course never makes it onto television, sums up his entire response to his detractors."
5,look at me and see,"De Palma has done it again with Body Double, making a roller coaster ride through the many passage ways of vouerism.Beatiful and clever and poetic and one of his best films along with Blow Up and Dressed To Kill. Reccomended."
3,Very 80'S,This moive is so 80'S I like it. Big hair leg warmersvery cheezy plot lots of T&A very hot chicks!
2,Lousy Compilation,There's much better Heep Compilations ('Running all night with the lion'... Please!!!) Don't waste your money.
2,Uriah Heep,This is a good classic rock cd with the exception that stealin one of their best songs is not on this or their greatest hits. The best song on here is Easy Livin so this is a cd only for a die hard Uriah Heep fan.
2,Difficult to remember once it's finished playing.,"With the exception of the catchy ""Easy Livin'"" I found this to be an unmemorable compilation of rock songs."
3,Kalifornia love.,"No reviews in 18 years? I always liked this film. Cool early role for Brad Pitt. Nice and dark. It seems whoever put this soundtrack together purposely choose unknown bands, to most people anyway. Quicksand is a good fit. They have a heavy sound like Helmet or Kyuss, and the song here is also on their great debut ""Slip"". East 17 is hip-hop or R&B, kinda odd choice. The Sheryl Crow song is nice, and on her debut also. The Indians have two songs here. They only ever released one 1993 album ""Indianism"". Love the X song. Good pop-punk. Therapy is ok, and Soup Dragons add a song I never heard. Very Soup Dragonsy though. This soundtrack had more potential. A bit of dialogue from the film would have been sweet. Wild At Heart and True Romance had better songs, but this is decent."
5,Great Comedy!!,This is a great little known comedy starring Carol Kane and Judge Reinhold escaping from the Mob.It's a must see!!
3,Too fast,"These nipples are REALLY fast flow. My twins were using fast flow nipples in ALL the other brands of bottles they had by 6 months plus sippy cups. I got these in place of the slow flow ones and the couldn't take it, the formula just spilled down them, it really is ridiculously fast. I HIGHLY suggest just getting the medium flow, these are way way too fast. It took them until they were almost 10 months old to be able to handle these without making a mess, like I said they were even on using sippy cups at 6months when I bought these and they were STILL too fast. SERIOUSLY, SKIP THESE and get the MEDIUM flow!!"
5,Love it!,"I love Playtex products for babys! They are greater than the prize...I will buy it if the prize will be more, because they worth it."
5,works very well,"I have been using this brand since my daughter was 6 months old and have had no problems with any of the slow, medium, or fast flow nipples. I do hand wash so I think they last longer than if washed in a dishwasher. I have never had them crack or break. they do kinda change color when I used Similac powder formula, not cows milk though."
2,"States a Problem, But Offers No Solution","The author is obviously a highly skilled pilot and has extensive experience. His recounting of the progress in the airline industry is very interesting. I bought the book expecting to read about progress in dealing with the problems encountered in adapting new technology and adjusting to the obviously over crowded skies. While the author states (over and over) that both are very real problems, he does not offer much in terms of what is being done to address the pilot's ever expanding workload. He seems merely intent on convincing the reader that the industry and the FAA are out to get the pilot. This book is not so much a study of human factors as a pilot's complaints about an industry that probably somehow just became something he no longer cared to be a part of."
4,Insight Guides Morocco,"This book was more useful as an introduction to the country and the culture than as a practical travel guide. The pictures were beautiful and made the place come alive, but I would probably pack a Rough Guide or Lonely Planet to take with me."
3,Not bad,"I must say, I am glad I waited until I found it cheap. I think it is worth $20 but not much more. I don't understand why the beginning of View to a Kill was cut, also, what is the difference between the ""uncencored"" video of Come Undone? I can say the quality of the DVD is awesome. The packaging is rather bizarre (white on white ink, yuk!) Needless to say, I don't blame the band,I blame the record company. If you find it for $20, get it, otherwise pass."
1,Awful Menu concept.,"The Videos are worth 5 stars, as Duran Duran were one of the first acts to really capitalize on this medium. Sadly, they partnered with somebody stupid who felt that making the menus complex, and hiding videos as ""easter eggs,"" would be fun. It's not. My remote control is not the best, and navigating the menu is cumbersome at best. You would think they would want to present the product they are selling. Yet another example of the music industry doing dumb stuff to decrease sales."
2,Weak DVD,"I'll echo some of the other reviews on here: the navigation is ridiculous, as is the ""easter egg"" hunt. With most DVD players ability to directly access any tracks, easter eggs aren't cool anymore. And one of my favorite videos ""A View To A Kill"" got the opening Bond gunbarrel and the beginning of the song chopped off (I'll assume it's due to licensing issues). FYI, it's not much better on the AVTAK movie DVD either: there, the video is unedited but it's cropped at the black bars so the floating cameras get cropped as well, plus it's worse quality than the Greatest version.For a band that single-handedly revolutionized the music video world and put MTV on the map, this is a shameful and appalling DVD. Hopefully there will be definitive DVD in the future that will include My Own Way, Careless Memories, and all the other ones that got left out, not to mention proper remastering and a better interface and package design. Hope springs eternal."
5,Yum!,"Delicious eighties cheese! These videos are as good as they were years ago...totally glam, they make you want to jet-set off to some Carribean isle. And the boys are pretty cute too. I prefer the earlier songs (Hungry Like the Wolf, Rio)and was a little disappointed that some of the more rarely seen videos (My Own Way) were not included."
1,WHY DOESN'T THIS HAVE ALL OF THEIR VIDEOS???,"Come on, 2 DVDs and they couldn't include all the videos? What's up with that? I'm sorry, but that's a slap in the face to the fans. I won't be forking over my money for this, thank you very much!"
2,They have so much - yet gave so little:(,"These DVDs are great - if you're only a minor fan of DURAN DURAN, but as a major fan of Simon and the boys; I felt neglected. If you're looking for lots of great extras - don't bother. They really didn't need to take up two discs with as little as they give you. The videos on the DVDs ARE their greatest hits, just don't expect much more(like their stuff from the 90's) so buy the set if you're a fan - because that's what we're stuck with for now."
2,Does not seems to match the song,"YukS!!!!!! Horrible and boring music video, espacially 'ORDINARY WORLD' doesn't suit the location and lyrics it should be inspirational."
3,Not as definitive NOR is it fans biggest wishes coming true,"Okay, it's nice to see 8 versions of ""New Moon On Monday"" (including the 18 minute version which makes sense of the sort of plot going on), but there's a lot of important things omitted. Their first video, ""Careless Memories"" - nowhere, along with singles like ""My Own Way,"" ""Meet El Presidente,"" ""Violence of Summer,"" ""Do You Believe in Shame?"" and non-single video classics like ""Last Chance on the Stairway,"" and ""Waiting for the Nightboat."" There's still a ton of stuff left and It's disappointing they ignored them."
4,Really Good Collection of Clips,"Duran,Duran are a Very Underrated Video Act to me.there Clips are still Cool&have held up really well all of these years later.very laid-back&Cool vibes.""Girls on Films"" is a Cool Video still.check it out if you have ever dug Duran Duran."
1,THIS COLLECTION SUCKS,"Here's why: the opening sequence to ""A View To A Kill"", has been removed! It is supposed to begin with Grace Jones leaping off the Eiffel Tower, but instead it starts instantly with the opening chords to the song itself - unacceptable! Also, no ""Meet El Presidente"", or ""Violence Of Summer"". Why didn't Duran Duran have the brains to make this an all-encompassing set to their great songs? Why not include all of their videos and hell, why not Arcadia and Power Station? I HATE this collection. ""Rio"" has NEVER looked worse - the colors are way oversaturated. Go back to the drawing board and TRY AGAIN DURAN DURAN!!"
1,Stick with the laserdisc versions...,"After reading these reviews, I won't bother buying this product. It sounds like the lasedisc versions of the videos might actually look better than the DVD."
2,Cheapest...don't buy this dvd!,"This is a very incomplete videography. Some gems are missing: ""Nightboat"", ""Careless Memories"",""Lonely In Your Nightmare"", ""My Own Way"", etc. Why bother to release a product that is obviously ""less that we expected"". Very bad marketing or a cheap attempt to re-release later with all the videos, so that we'll have to buy it twice. The first three records were remastered lately with no extra singles at all and now we have this dvd that could have had everything instead of giving us 25 versions of ""New Moon on Monday"". Really weird!Why bother to put ""hidden"" videos when it is written on the sleeve. It is just annoying not to have them on a regular menu.EMI should have take example on the ""Best of Bowie"" dvd which is a good example of a well-done product that respect the fans."
2,Disappointing,"Using the ""hidden easter eggs"" to see the remaining videos is gimmicky and useless. If you're having trouble finding them, simply use the ""Title"" selection feature on your dvd player and enter each number one at a time to cycle through everything (the first disc has 38 titles). The picture quality is shoddy. It is ridiculous not to have included ALL of their videos. Be warned: the 30 minute interview, lyrics, etc. are DVD-ROM only. It would have been cool to have had the band offer commentary on these groundbreaking (at the time) clips, but nothing. What would have been welcome are the concert film, ""Sing Blue Silver"", and the concept film, ""Arena"". The 18 minute ""New Moon On Monday"" is a nice surprise. Otherwise, buy at your own risk."
4,"Great DVD, odd package","I love the videos and the Easter Eggs in this DVD, but one little quirk is the discs are labeled reverse so the material listed for disc one is on disc two and vice versa. But everything that's supposed to be on the discs is there, so I didn't bother to return it. Just be warned, if you get the same, you may want to return it."
3,"Pretty nice, but easily torn.","I bought it to spruce up my new truck. Out of everything I bought this is the only thing that is damaged.About 4 hours after I installed it (which was a pain), it brushed my knife's clip and ripped. Now most of the top is gone and chunks out of the rest of it.Tears easily, has a heavy imitation leather smell (which is still better than rubber), and but it does look good.. or did.2.5 Stars."
3,"Meh, ok steering wheel cover","This thing looks good, but it is BIG. I am 6'4"", and it feels big on my hands when installed on my 2004 Dodge Ram. Still, it is better than my old gross steering wheel. It took some effort to get on, but it does fit nicely. The key is to slowly make your way around the wheel one little bit at a time."
5,Looks great,It was a little hard to stretch out but after fighting with it about 5 minutes I got it on and feels great
3,Good value,"This steering wheel cover looks very good. It is exceptionally easy to install. I am not sure how durable it will be, but so far it seems pretty good. If you have small hands, it may result in a steering wheel that is too big around to be comfortable in your hands. It is fine for me, as I have big hands. Not so good for my wife. I would not recommend this for someone with small hands.JACK"
4,Great New Age Summary,"I purchased this book as a gift for a retired college professor friend. My own copy was so worn out and marked up, I didn't feel I could lend it to a friend, and I wanted to keep my own. I consider it a wonderful interpretation and source-book of the philosophical strivings of the boom generation. It is comprehensive, well-written, and full of fascinating real-life details and stories. I wish it had contained more biographical information about its author, Marilyn Feguson, however. It seems she has read everything in the world, but knowing her academic credentials would have helped me cite her as an authority. I am sorry it is out of print."
3,Please Customer,"The book, "" The Arquarian Conspiracy"" was recieved on time. The condiction of the book was good. The price was right"
2,Are you a star child?,"Thesis: Carlos Castenada, Teilhard de Chardin, Herman Hesse, Carl Jung, J. Krishnamurti, and a hundred others are part of a new, evolutionary consciousness, and we can be too!"
3,Very good,"This freshly written book about comparative physiology is at its best when describing how some of the basic mechanisms of life - such as circulation, homeostasis and metabolism - work, in distinctly lay terms. Much of it will be familiar territory for anyone who took serious interest in their college biology and chemistry classes, but the organization is fine. Another bright point about ""Why Geese"" is the clarity and good humor it brings to the subject of evolution. For once, being a packrat served me in some small way: I bought and read about half of this enjoyable book when it came out, then for some reason put it away for five years before finishing it in the last several days."
5,Get the Thelema edition,The Thelema Press version gives the best possible rendition of this occult enterprise...see the main listing.
5,nona and tess,"i have them and i lov them, they are so cool, but there is one bad side to nona, her name means grandma in Italian -_-S.P STILL LOVE THE DOLLS!"
1,????,"I AM CONFUSED I THOUGHT THAT THESE TWINS WERE SUPPOSE TO BE A SET OF A BROTHER AND A SISTER. AND FROM THIS PICTURE I DONT SEE ONE THATS A GUY. THEY SHOULD TAKE OFF ALL OF THE WRITING THAT SAYS ""BROTHER"""
5,"Oh hi Madison Bella,I have these 2 and they rock!","THese twinz rock so much!I got them 4 my birthday and I forgot but I do remember 1 is solo! Sorry 4 the lousy imfo but I lost the silver key chain!The devils namw is Nona and she has red and black pants ans a shirt that sais misunderstood and a red leather jacket!

5,I think these dolls are pretty,I do not own these. I might want to get them though. The outfits they come in are O so cute. I really like these Twiins bratz doll and I own the newest twiins Orainna and Valentina which I love and give 5 stars. These like ALL bratz dolls are extremely oringal! Bratz Rock & so does My Scene! *~K3L7M5~* BYE
4,underware,i tryed them on and they fit well. other than that i havent worn them. Im saving them for my wedding day. Im a boxerman but needed a sexy pair for my wedding. they make my package look good. I hope the ole lady likes them.
1,Not what I ordered,"It's probably not Amazon's fault... It's the cell phone industry trying to flood the market with stuff that becomes obsolete quickly. Just think of all the different phone chargers you've had to buy over the years. Standardization would be nice for the consumer.The phone I needed a face plate for is several years old. The original picture of the face plate I ordered was exactly what I wanted, but the one I received was a ""newer"" version.The good news is that Amazon took the product back and returned the money to my credit card."
5,One of the best albums in my collection,"Shootyz Groove is the epitome of street-core, twinged reggae, hip-hop, metal, and dope rhythms. I do not own an album that captures the aforementioned elements so well. The songs on this album are classics and should be recognized as such. Shootyz deserves more credit than they have received. See them live when they perform ""Level,"" you'll agree."
1,Skepticism at its best,"This book is wonderful is you wish to disparage and ridicule marian apparitions; indeed, Mr. Garvey takes you on a tour of all the bogus, sad, uninspired and demented ""appartion"" sites in America. What he fails to do is show Church-approved, or even Church-approvable apparition sites. True, he is working in the American apparition milieu where Church-approved apparition sites are few and far between; but reading this book, one might come away with the impression that Marian Apparitions are laughable, at best. For a more counterbalanced look at the phenomena read about Fatima, a fully Church approved apparition. For the truly skeptical, I recommend ""Encountering Mary"" by Sandra L. Zimdars-Swartz, a remarkable book which both believers and skeptics can appreciate. However, the book in question delivers nothing but snide commentary at a phenomena which has brought countless millions to a life of greater holiness."
5,Shoe Leather Observer,"I give Mark Garvey credit for actually personally going to these various sites in the U.S. and observing what went on, with in some cases personal interviews with the seers themselves. Yet he saved his biggest punch for last in the last chapter when he visited Necedah, Wisconsin. I was moved by his descriptions of the torment that Mary Ann Van Hoof experienced. Otherwise, Mark Garvey is really funny and he had me laughing out loud at some of his comments. I take my hat off to this man for venturing into this field of inquiry. He has done religious people of the U.S. a service in writing this book."
4,An engaging tour of a fascinating American subculture,"Garvey's book was very enjoyable and provided a vivid glimpse of a very interesting religious subculture. For the most part, I got a kick out of Garvey's humorous observations regarding his interactions with the individuals who flock to these apparition sites; however, sometimes his comments were inappropriately demeaning in my opinion. Nonetheless, I gained much from reading this book and would recommend it to others."
2,Mediocre review of Neural Networks,"Besides grammatical mistakes and obvious errors in translation, the book doesn't delve deep into the places it promises, and concentrates on analogies that play to the lay-est of laymen rather than focusing on the actual data and theories of neural networks. Chapters on neuroplasticity and feedback are worthwhile, but the book quickly derails onto a scene of neuroscientific generalism, which seems to be the popular fad among most brain books today, which seem to pass around the same cache of information on L-Dopa, homunculi, and Aplysia to take up a good 25% of 75% of the books in print. Good for an introduction to neural nets and semantic networks, but not a valuable reference."
1,Worst case EVER!,"this is the worst thing ever made! when you get the case, it looks nice and all, but here's the catch: it won't fit! you can jam it and pull it all you want but it won't work. The only thing that does work is cutting the case with some scissors. This is horrible, selling a case that doesn't fit the phone."
3,great guitar playing but not a great performance,"I may be the only one to disagree with the raves this album received, but I think the Dominoes weren't particularly wonderful on these recorded performances. Whitlock plays some pretty clunky piano - even misses a chord change or two. Radle plays steady but largely unimaginative bass. Gordon acquits himself quite well until the over blown solo on Let It Rain. As for Clapton - his voice is trashed, which kind of lets the emotion burn through in an effective way but technically it ain't great. And, yeah, his guitar playing is ferocious, frenzied, and nervous. He could have used a rhythm guitar player there because it sounds, to me, like he struggled to get the fills and lead in - something that Pete Townshend could do with much more agility. That being said - I love Things Gotta Get Better in a Little While. It's Clapton's true masterpiece. It's better than anything else he's ever done..."
1,TERRIBLE VERSION,"I purchased this cd when it was first released and was very excited about the extra tracks this version have over Derek And The Dominos In Concert which was released on cd in the Eighties. After playing it and comparing it to the original Derek And The Dominos In Concert cd I was majorly dissappointed. The mixing on Live at the Fillmore puts Clapton up front of the soundstage making his contribution to the cd stand out. As for the rest of the band they sound like they are playing a block away. The cd has become known to myself and my friends as ""Eric and the Dominos"".On the original In Concert cd the band is tight and Eric is where is suppose to be - in the band and not a soloist.The music is awesome but the mixing on Live at the FillmoreI really bad. If you are looking for a live version of Derek and the Dominos, pick up Derek and the Dominos In Concert.Even though there are less tracks this version highlights the Band and not the Clapton the Soloist."
2,Derek and the Dominos: Live at the Fillmore,"I bought this set because of the rave reviews that went with it. And, because I had this snatch of memory from when I was young that I had wanted to buy this. Truthfully everyone, it's a disappointment. I have listened to it several times and while there are certainly songs that I like, and this is Clapton without all of the ""maturity"", the harmonies are usually bad (just shy of awful in some cases), the music does go on and it does, in hindsight, seem that they are in love with the new wa-wa pedal, amongst other sound enhancers.I know, Clapton's God. But, I'm an agnostic. Slowhand is great, and the young years are better than most of the older years for originality, but it's not smooth, if that's what you need from a CD."
2,Overrated,"Boring, bloated, overlong, repetitive half-baked arrangements of Clapton classics made even worse by Bobby Whitlock's horrible, intrusive over-the-top ""backup"" singing.2 stars for some nice guitar solos and drummer Jim Gordon's amazing work, but it is not worth the 29 dollars. Better you should buy ""Wheels Of Fire"" or ""Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert"" or ""Layla.""Pass."
4,A fine addition to the Clapton catalogue,"Eric Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, Carl Radle and Jim Gordon play some truly memorable live blues rock on this fine double album.Clapton may not have had too high an opinion of himself as a singer at this point (he seems more comfortable playing his guitar), and his vocals do sound strained at times. But he does his best to compensate with a number of lengthy solos, several riveting ones, some good ones, and a few dull, misguided ones, too.Most of these live cuts are a very welcome addition to the Clapton legacy, though, especially the superb take on Big Bill Broonzy's ""Key To The Highway"", the rocking ""Bottle Of Red Wine"" and ""Blues Power"" (nice boogie piano by Whitlock), and the eerie ""Crossroads"".I can't imagine anyone who is into early Eric Clapton not liking this fine album."
5,"Clapton in all his pain, and all his glory.","I generally agree that the Allmans Live at the Fillmore is probably the greatest live rock recording ever, but...Can you think of a better kick-it-off song than Got To Get Better In A Little While? This is virtuosity, top to bottom. We all know the pain EC was going thru with drugs and his love for Patti Harrison, and we know it inspired his playing at the time. But listen to Bobby Whitlock on keyboards, listen to Carl Radle on bass, listen to Jim Gordon on drums. They followed Clapton wherever he went musically and made it all come together.I've seen the man live in the late 80s and early 90s, and on a lot of videos for benefits and the like...and I would think any Clapton fan would agree that he has NEVER matched the outright emotional playing he achieved during these Fillmore shows.SteveS."
4,Excelent live album,"It's not so wonderfull like Layla and other assorted love songs, but it's a great live record from EC. I think that EC was modelating his peak to be a front guitar player band, so you can't wait EC shinning like in the Cream era or Bluesbreker era."
5,EC At HIS BEST LIVE,"I have seen Eric live many times, and never heard him so awesome as this. He wails away on every tune, something he never does at all his concerts. This is a must have for any fan of EC!"
5,Derek and the Dominos Live - Clapton Never Better,"To avoid repetition, I'll just say this: I first heard this album (remember those?) when I was a high school freshman, 32 years ago, and it's still one of my 5 favorite of all time. I saw Clapton in Atlanta 3 weeks ago, and his version of ""Got to get better in a little while"" was so good, so tight, it was hauntingly similar to the version on this cd. This music is timeless and will be enjoyed by anyone at all interested in Clapton."
1,Warning! Do not buy this CD if you are expecting originals!,"This CD may be OK; I didn't bother to listen to it.Nowhere in the description here did it mention that it's a live recording done in Atlanta Georga in 1980. It says that on the sleeve of the CD though. I wanted the original recordings that I know and love; not a concert ""live"" recording that isn't anywhere near what I was expecting. Why was this omitted from the description?All is not lost however. I took the sleeves out, and threw the CD in the trash along with them, so now I have a wonderful (but expensive) extra blank case to put a CD in that features music I want to hear because it's original, done in a proper studio, and up to par soundwise.Slogging this dog off as genuine recordings is reprehensible, and I suspect I'm not the only one to get the wrong end of this particular stick, according to the sales ranking Amazon posted regarding this item."
1,slick propaganda from the vets and the food industry,"carefully hidden and slickly produced film from the Veterinary Medical Association (the same ones that promote vaccinations) and a foundation front for the commercial cat food industry ... named at the end of the vid, but not named on the cover for this vhs tape. Ann Childers probably means well, but experience and research has taught me to keep my cats far from vaccinations and commercial cat food, especially the dry bags that they promote with glee."
3,Collectors Edition Johnny Paycheck,"For all us die hard Paycheck fans I was a little disappointed in this cd. These songs have been redone by Paycheck , they are not the original versions, some of the tempo is different . I really purchased this cd for the song In Memory of a Memory, which is a very good remake of the original, Because I have not been able to find this song on any other recording. All in all this is a very good sounding cd, it would have been a better collection if all the songs were original."
5,great for cats!,"This is not your typical baby food review. I ordered these for my cats so they can have more fiber in their diet (issues with constipation), and they LOVE the winter squash baby food. My two cats go crazy simply hearing the ""pop"" sound of a newly opened jar. The jars themselves are made of pretty thick glass, so I've had no issues of glass breaking. Can't beat the price per bottle (after subscription) anywhere else on the web or at the local grocery store. Totally satisfied customer here."
3,Misleading Description,The product description is quite misleading. This item is purely the case itself -- nothing else. No cards included. We'll give the case a workout and then report back.
2,Very mildly entertaining,"Interesting plot, I thought as I watched the trailer. Found it predictable and boring, most of the time. Could have been much better."
3,"Gwyneth fans will fawn over ""Sliding Doors""","""Sliding Doors"" is a good example of a nice, enjoyable movie. Gwyneth Paltrow plays a young English woman named Helen, who, if only she had made her train, would have lived a very different life. We see both lives and how life unfolds not by choices made but by chances lost. Helen's boyfriend is a two-timing cad-- and the real question is: at what point in each life will she find out? And how will Helen handle it? The results are tender, amusing, and interesting.Well acted (Paltrow has a pretty good handle on a British accent and is just plain sweet) and even the over-the-top actors aren't too much to stomach. I really enjoyed this little movie, especially since I didn't expect much from it. A good fourth-date movie."
4,adored John Hannah,"I was expecting a click-flick, but the two-track format kept it interesting without becoming a gimmick, and Gwynneth's hair cleverly saved it from utter confusion. I myself just totally fell in love with sweet and charming John Hannah. Gives hope for the rest of us nice but ordinary-looking blokes!"
3,A watchable movie with an interesting idea.,"This was a pretty decent movie. It wasn't as confusing as I thought it would be really. The acting by all was quite good and the plot was actually a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of recent movies that I've seen. It seemed a little long in length, but that wasn't a minus against it. If you're a fan of this movie and would like to view another film that is similar, watch Run Lola Run (another film worthy of a viewing). Sliding Doors was good."
3,Sliding doors,"The movie was just ok. It was suggested to me by a friend, I love Gwyneth Paltrow in whatever she does. But not one of my favorite movies. Loved the quick delivery as always."
4,Fun movie,"Highly recommended by me. Worth the time, funny how few second can change life's... I like it... See the movie now."
3,It's all in the timing,"This movie was good if you are a big fan of Gwenyth Paltrow. But the premise of an alternative life being interwoven together in the many confusing scenes where the sliding doors were timed just so ..... Well, it was a bit much to expect from your audience to buy...even for a fantasy."
3,Not bad at all,"Chick flick story. A little slow and obvious in places, but the acting is pretty good and this movie has a satisfying ending without being 'twee'."
3,life in parallel worlds,"In a way this is sci fi as at one point missing a train splitsthe life of Helen in two: one blond and one with here natural light brown hair.She seems to be attracted to tall and dark( the one fellow falls short of handsome?).Both appear to be cads, but the one fellow is actually alright.If you like Gwyneth Paltrow, you should like this movie,but i can't say there is a lot to make you want to see it.The love affairs are pretty dull even with the fighting.Paltrow has none of the sparks that one sees in her famous films:Shakespeare in Love (Miramax Collector's Series)orProof.I didn't much like the result."
5,Great movie that shows how fate is real,"This has to be one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. It has a great moral to it and gives the human soul a refreshing outlook on shady situations. It shows how everything happens for a reason and no matter how much we try to avoid life, our destiny catches up to us."
4,twisty!!!,"coming into this movie, i really did not know too much about it. from reading the box, it seemed interesting and after actually seeing it, i was absolutely captivated!!!! the concept was fantastic - i think we have ALL put ourselves in a ""what-if"" type scenario - wondering what would have happened if we would have made a different choice in something that we did, etc or if in getting somewhere 5 minutes earlier or later, if things would have happened differently. i really loved this movie and i don't think it was hyped enough. i am not a big gwenyth fan(not even sure if her name is spelled correctly), but i really liked her in this!!!!!"
4,"Refreshing concept, but could be better","I just finished watching Sliding Doors and have my opinion fresh in my mind. The ""what if"" concept is very intriguing and Gwyneth Paltrow could pass for a Brit any day of the week. I did not like John Lynch's anemic and scheming character at all and the fact that the sweet Helen was with him made her lose something. Perhaps the casting was bad, but they seemed so mismatched. In my opinion, John Hannah was the shining light in the film, almost outshining Gwyneth Paltrow. It was nice to see him hold his own as a leading man outside of the ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" gang. I would recommend this film for a quirky, fun movie experience, but once you've seen it, you won't need to see it again because there will be no more surprises. But treat yourself and enjoy it once."
3,The thinking chick's flick.,"After a superb start (and hugely promising metaphysical premise) this film deteriates into just another cosy brit romcom, one definately just for the girls. Are all men bastards whichever alternative reality you look at it? We never really find out, though admittedly only the ending(s) of this film really lives up to the promise of its beginning(s)."
4,Loved it!,"One of those movies that makes you step back and think of all of the ""what if's"" in life. Very enjoyable!!"
4,If Only . . . If Only . . .,"This engaging comedy-drama seeks to answer the question ""What if things had gone differently?"" In ""Sliding Doors,"" things go very differently for Gwenyth Paltrow depending on whether she catches a particular London subway train or not. In one scenario, she arrives home in time to catch her boyfriend in bed with another woman; in the other she does not. (The movie cuts between the two and is so well ordered that we, the audience, always know which scenario is which). It's great fun to see just how differently her life plays out according to that one small event, but you might be surprised at how the movie ends! A very thoughtful and entertaining film, with excellent direction and good strong performances throughout."
5,Simply Wonderful!!!,"I absoloutely LOVE this movie! I didn't want to go see it in the theatre because I was afraid it wouldn't be that good, but was I ever wrong!! I watched it and rewound it and watched it again!!"
4,I loved this movie!,This movie had a great story line and great acting by ms paltrow and john hannah! It was funny with witty lines and had no violence. The ending is a surprise that I wouldn't have thought of and the whole movie engages you.
3,Cute & entertaining for a rainy day.,"""What if I had done that instead?"" is a question we have all asked ourself at some point. This movie explores that question by showing two completely different scenarios that resulted from one little twist of fate. It's a cute concept for a film, and many people rave about it's plot, but the direction and staging were a bit weak. No violence, and just a little negativity make it a worth-renting video."
5,Loved It!!!,I had rented on a chance with my friend one Friday night and I Loved It!!!!!! I am not a big fan of Ms. Paltrow but her acting was superb! I can't wait to own it!!
1,Seriously?,Did anyone seriously not see the end of the movie from the beginning? Super predictible. Paltrow seems to rarely impress. I generally am not - watching films in the romantic comedy genre - however I recognize when a movie is romantic or comedic. This film was neither.
4,Like looking into a crystal ball,"Wow! At first the film made me crazy, because I wanted it to pick a path and stick with it to see what would happen, but as the story unfolded, I became intriqued with the double ""life"" so to say of Helen. I found how the film was put together amazing so to keep you from becoming confused as to what was going on with whom. very thought provoking. Scary to think how just minutes can forever change the outcome of your life."
5,This is my favorite movie,I loved this movie soooo much. I think it is so sweet and romantic. It always cheers me up when I am sad. I think everyone should buy this movie.
1,No 0 Star rating??,"Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't let you give something 0 stars. Thats the only reason this is getting 1 star.What were you thinking, Gwyneth? And John Hannah - How embarassing for you."
2,Waste of Time,"I didn't like this movie. It was a waste of time. I thought it was stupid and ridiculous not to mention confusing. Hard to keep the all the lives straight, who was with who, etc."
2,"Love Gwyneth, but this was disappointing","Paltrow is such a good actress, but even her brilliance couldn't save this film. Good story but bad script and poorly cast leading man with whom Paltrow had no chemistry. If you can't buy their relationship, the whole movie falls apart."
1,Worth less movie !,"Do NOT waste your time ! Boring dull long slow, lame dumb plot.Really sucked and was stupid, bad Brittish accent on Paltrow also !"
1,Soo boring!,I didn't even finish this movie it was painfully boring. Her British accent isn't very convincing and the plot is terrible.
3,Sliding Doors was just OK,A very forgettable movie. I watched this movie a week ago..and forgot all about it! I'm so glad I didn't have to pay to watch it.
3,slow but ok,Didn't care that much for the British accent from Gwenyth Paltrow but a decent movie for a night when I was home alone.
4,Cute movie,"The quality was not fantastic, but that may be more related to our internet connection. But the service and selection is great with our Prime membership."
3,Ok,Sliding doors was okay. The once pt was neat but it was very slow moving and kind of hard to follow at times.
3,"Not usually a Gwyneth fan, but...","I had low expectations for this movie even though friends highly recommended it. But after finally stumbling in to see it I was pleasantly surprised. John Hannah is so disarmingly charming as James Hamilton, the preferable what-if alternative to the two-timimg boyfriend played by John Lynch. Paltrow, who seems to be forever playing the same character in all her movies, fits in perfectly as Helen. Be forewarned that a heavy dose of suspension of disbelief is necessary. All in all the movie is worthwhile and enjoyable (despite some ham-handed performances, attn. Jeanne Tripplehorn)- a testament to how a split-second move can, plausibly, change your destiny."
5,In one word: Phenomenal!,I thought this movie was brilliant! The story was a terrific and fresh idea. It was a refreshing difference to all of the other movies in it's genre. I love Gwyneth Paltrow and this movie made me love her even more. Her performance was magnificent and very well delivered. I also thought that her English accent was very believable! I would definately recommend this movie to people.
4,A good movie for Gwyneth,"Not being a huge Gwyneth Paltrow fan I was skeptical the first time I saw this. I was very pleasantly surprised, the story is interesting, the acting is good, and the characters are real. I recommend this to anyone who might be interested in a slightly different romantic comedy."
5,What if?,"What if. . . .you miss the train? you hadn't gone into that bar? you didn't become a blond? This engaging film follows the two very different lives a young London woman might have had based on one such trivial event. Gwenyth Paltrow is marvelous inhabiting the two leads, one, the beaten down red-haired girlfriend of the hopelessly confused and cowardly Gerry, the other as a beautiful blond who has broken free, although with a lot of heartbreak. Paltrow does a wonderful job of creating the two different roles, through body language, facial expressions and her gorgeous smile.The story flounders a bit because of the hapless Gerry, so muddled and weak that it's hard to figure out why two gorgeous women, one Paltrow, the other a beautiful Jean Tripplethorn, are falling all over him. But the story is very engaging, and the back-and-forth switches between the two Paltrow roles keep the viewers on their toes. I liked it!"
3,It is okay.,"I love Gwyneth Paltrow, but this movie really wasn't that great. I really wish they would they would stop putting a word limit to the reviews."
3,Parallel romance stories,"I shall repeat here the best review I read before selecting ""Sliding Doors"": It is a mentally challenging romance story."
3,It's Okay,This movie is okay. Not one of the best but not one of the worst I've watched. Kind of an odd movie.
4,Sliding Doors,One of Gwyneth Paltrow's finest. She does an American faux English accent up there with Kevin Kline's faux French accent in French Kiss. Amusing dialogue scenes between Gerry and his buddy Russell. Written & Directed by Peter Howitt.
3,Not what i was expecting,"I had seen this movie out for a couple of years but never had the opportunity to see it. When i did recently i was expecting a romantic comedy that was lighthearted and simple. The movie actually had two completely different things going on. As the title suggests the difference of a sliding door changes everything, but the movie is focused on showing the two roads taken. At the end it was a thought filled sort of show."
5,Timeless Movie to be watched again and again,"I enjoyed this movie when I was younger, then forgot about it, until I found it on Amazon and purchased it. It really is a timeless classic that most people have not heard of, but is absolutely worth watching. It's one of those movies that makes you think about life, and can be watched over and over."
1,Sliding doors,What was this movie about?confusing and switches back and forth with events of the movie happining . Really - really confusing . I donated 2.99 to tell everyone to leave on the shelf
2,too long & horrible ending,"This would have gotten 3 stars from me if it weren't for the miserably cheesy ending... and maybe even 4 if you cut down the length. It may deserve more than 2 stars when compared to the usual Hollywood claptrap, but nothing convinced me this was a story worth telling... or viewing."
3,The difference between making and missing a train,"Sometimes life can be altered by simply catching a train. The opening scenes are quite captivating. Making the train, Gwyneth Pathrow's character catches her boyfriend cheating. Missing, the cheating game continues.The movie is a little slow in spots. Some of the shifting between the making train world and missing train world can grow a bit wearisome. And the cheating boyfriend is just a hateful character. Nonetheless, the subject matter does have some intrigue about how life can change by sliding through a door."
5,"A very well made movie, one of my all-time favorites! :)","This movie is thought-enganging and has a nice mix of comedy and drama. You can relate to both of the ""lives"" of Paltrow and hopefully learn a lesson from her tribulations."
3,Pleasantly forgettable,"A pleasant enough contemporary London lifestyle (somewhat) comic drama, with a good enough performance by Gwyneth Paltrow to make it watchable, but a slight enough story to make it forgettable 5 minutes after it is over. Based on a ""what if she hadn't missed that train"" premise, the plot is not really plausible enough to be convincing, and not really fantasically coincidental enough to make it interesting. And did the two male ""leads"" reallyhave to be a Scot and a Welshman?! Come on........"
5,Quirky,"Here was an interesting movie about choices and coincidences as well as consideration of the road less traveled. I appreciated the acting, humor and drama. It is worth watching."
5,Unique and entertaining,"I had seen this film a few years ago and wanted to watch it again because I am now in film school. I like the story because it gives u a visual look at how our lives are affected by choices. But also how a small thing like being late or missing a train can change the outcome of where you life goes. The acting in this film is excellent and I enjoyed seeing Gwenneth Paltrow as a less glamorous and somewhat insecure charachter. Like many of her films, she does a great job."
4,"Different, but great!","Interesting movie, what would happen when.....How time and other circumstances can change our lives or is everything suppose to be no matter what? Gwyneth Paltrow is wonderful like always."
2,Mediocre,"An original story idea that was watered down by a lackluster script, bland acting and unlikable characters. Not even Hollywood's golden girl paired with a snappy new hairdo and a bottle of peroxide could add the necessary zest.With the exception of Helen and her female friend, all of the characters were repulsive and had no redeeming qualities. The film portrays John Hannah's character as 'Mr. Right,' even though he's deceived Helen all along by failing to mention a certain something about himself (I won't spoil the ending). Even his explanation doesn't get him off the hook, because he still lied and deceived her.Also, I could understand the use for Paltrow's accent in Shakespeare In Love and Emma, but was it really necessary in this movie?"
1,My mom hated it...,"and then spent the whole movie telling me she hated it, then demanded that I give it only one star.Movie was described as a ""comedy-drama"" - definitely more drama than comedy."
2,it's just a flesh wound,"I appreciate the attempt to contrast two ways of relating, the egotistical, ""see what you can get away with"" version of sex addiction, and one that is more genuine. I just found it annoying. Like the Monty Python guys say, ""It's just a flesh wound!"""
5,"Funny, intellegent and just plain fun to watch!","This movie is very original. There is a point in this movie where it splits, and the wonderful Gwyneth Paltrow's life takes different routes. Thank God for her change of hair color! It would've been VERY confusing if she'd looked EXACTLY the same throughout the whole thing... It's very good. Very interesting and worth your time and money."
5,Sliding Doors,"I loved this movie! I think it was a simple yet excellent interpretation of how a basic event like missing or catching the subway train home from work can change the course of your life. Altough it follows two story lines, the movie is still easy to follow and comprehend despite the initial confusion at the beginning. Hey, everyone has their different opinions, even so called ""professional"" movie critics. This one is worth checking out for yourself. Superb performances from Gwentyh Paltrow and John Hanna carried me along rather nicely through the movie. You'll love John Hannah's witty phrases. Sliding Doors is a must buy for the home movie archive. Check it out!"
4,Cute,"Not an amazing movie but definitely endearing, great for a rainy day. The highlights of course are John Hannah and Gwyneth Paltrow. After his uninteresting character in Mummy, John Hannah surprised with a wonderful, cuddly romantic lead, just the kind of guy you would love to bump into but wouldn't be afraid to actually talk to. Gwyneth Paltrow continues to amaze by her range, she is equally capable of being glamorous or plain. Very few contemporary actresses seem to have her range."
4,"Great movie, but poor quality recording",I just wanted to let everyone know that the recording quality is poor. The master used to make the DVD recording had 'popcorn' and the widescreen format cut valuable footage from the bottom of the movie. Other than that the movie is original and the cast is superb.
1,Atrocious!!!,"This has a good cast, the direction is okay, and it obviously had a decent budget too. Even the concept is interesting. However, the script is quite possibly the worst I have ever heard and it renders the movie virtually unwatchable. The characters are totally unbelievable, and quite frankly, irritating. I could not understand why she would want to be with either of those twats. So,without a hint of hyberbole, this is easily the worst film I have seen since Xanadu. I absolutely hated it."
4,A movie worth watching!,"Definitely a WONDERFUL movie, Sliding Doors, brings to the screen two parallel stories unfolding simultaneously involving an English girl living and working in London.The movie opens a window into other possibilities and ""what ifs"". It is a film about human relations, friendship, trust, love, and inner strength.Gwyneth Paltrow (who is GORGEOUS), John Hannah, and the rest of the cast give it their 100% themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least (the chemistry is AMAZING)!The only negative point is Gwyneth Paltrow's British accent, which surprisingly, is not convincing at all!Sliding Doors does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face. Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment. It is a movie worth watching!"
3,Great date movie,I really enjoyed this movie. It's interesting to see what happens IF.It's an exciting look into what we always think of: How things could haveturned out if we would have chosen a different path or if fate would have had something different in store for us.I think it's a great date movie.
4,"great book, but really",this book is a fun read but one detail really bothers me. Marlene is 6 months pregnant with twins. now what women in this condition could do the physically demanding actions she does in this book. plus what woman would jepordize their potential life.
2,Still waiting!,This was our 1st Robert Tanenbaum's novel. We found we were waiting for the suspense as the title would suggest. We found it rambling on at times and hard to pick up. Maybe we have to read the previous Karp/Ciampi series and it would let us to get to know the characters better instead of just jumping in like the middle of a movie and try to guess who is who. The title and brief summary captured our attention then we felt let down by the end.
3,Not Mansell at Her Best,"I like some of Jill Mansell's novels: Brit Chick Lit, usually upbeat with interesting quirky characters.Staying at Daisy's was just so-so. It took so long to get anywhere.Daisy's father owns a posh country hotel and Daisy acts as the manager. She's beautiful and sexy and nice, but not especially interesting. Her friends are beautiful and sexy and not especially nice or interesting.Are you as bored as I am at this point? Thought so."
5,Got me back to reading,"I happened to pick this book up in Portugal while there on vacation. I used to be an avid reader but like everything else, I lost time to endulge in this pleasure!The book was laying amongst a lot of other dicarded books and the cover caught my eye.From the first page on, I was hooked. It is funny, lots of characters to follow without being difficult, lots of laughs! I liked it so much I brought it back to Canada with me and now I am on the hunt for the rest of Jill Mansell's books.I would reccommend her books to anyone who likes a good, funny and romantic story. There is nothing in this book that is offending and no violence!Thank you Ms Mansell for giving me back the ability to MAKE TIME TO READ.Janet BritoVancouverCanada"
4,Staying at Daisy's,I finally started reading this book on Kindle and find it difficult to put down. It is very easy reading and light. The characters r interesting and very relatable.
4,Another fun British Romp!,This was my second Jill Mansell book and again I felt like I was surrounded by friends that I've known for a lifetime. I loved all of the quirky characters in this book and also enjoyed the twist to the story that ends up making Daisy comes to terms with many things in her life.Recommend? I would recommend this one to my friends because it was a fun and comfy read. Nothing earth shattering happens but it was a solid story with great characters that made me want to check into Daisy's hotel if and when I ever get to England before I die!!
3,"Not the best, but not the worst","This is not my favorite Jill Mansell book. I liked the characters, the premise, the location...but it was just over all bland. I think there was a lot of potential, but not enough interaction between the main couple. I don't regret reading it, but for me, it just doesn't compare to Millie's Fling."
3,"good, but nothing really special","I was not sure how many stars to give this novel. The first chapters are just plain boring and although it gets pretty entertaining as the story goes on, the love story of the main characters is the least interesting of all the subplots of the book. They are madly in love, but you never see it happening, they barely interact with each other! There are more interesting chick lit novels out there, pass on this one."
1,Unforgivable,"This review is really for Amazon and it's supplier but the supplier of this DVD has forgotten to pack MAIN FEATURE. Yes, that means I've received bonus DVD only and what Amazon offer is refund. Ordering from outside US cost considerably more and I do feel cheated, yet there is nothing I can do about this but place order again and pay for shipping again, for no fault of my own. I am very disappointed to say the least. Please note, I didn't want to give any star for this but I had no choice but to give one star."
5,don't be a dink and miss this fatabulous series!,The only thing wrong with this series is all of the books are not on tape . Loved the books .Loved the movies.
3,technical difficulties as well,"I also went through two copies of the DVD and returned both due to the tale end skipping and not reading on my player. One was purchased through Amazon, another through Borders, both had trouble in the same spot! I love the books, and enjoyed what I saw to the point it fritzed out. I had seen it on Showtime initially and went out and bought the books and the first two series...what a gem. Hopefully I will get lucky on the next purchase."
4,Warning-Disc1 Doesn't Work W/XboxDVDPlayer! Great Otherwise.,Just wanted to write a quick note of warning - DVD #1 (with the actual show) was incompatible with my Xbox DVD player. I've tried 3 different discs and none would work. Disc #2 with featurettes does work. Would have rated 5 otherwise. Enjoy!
3,No Further,"what sounds to be a good deal with the two disc set, heres what you get.the disc jacket wasn't even made for two disc.disc one; no scene selection, runs straight through.disc two; commentary, blah, blah, blah."
4,Where's Mona?,"I just LOVED this entire Series but for the life of me I cannot understand why he has left Mona out of the last enstallment having her relocating to Seattle. It just doesn't make sense especially after Mona finds her real Father/Mother to be her own landlady AND she also finds her grandmother, so why would she skip town? I know she was kinda flaky but it was odd with her not being there. Her old lover D'orthea ends up with DeDe and it was also odd that D'or doesn't even mention anything about her old pal Mona. Her ommission was greatly missed, especially at the end with Mary Ann and Brian's wedding. Despite this I am such a Fan and only wish there was more. I just can't get enough. This DVD and the others in the series are superb and was happy to see it's full unedited content. I had absolutely no problems whatsoever with the quality of the dvd and had no problems with ""Freezing"" or ""Skipping"". It ran smooth from start to finish. All three Sets are a MUST HAVE!"
4,"Bring on ""Babycakes""","I have watched and own all three ""Tales of The City"" mini-series and have watched them all repeatedly. While the first is by far my favorite (as others have mentioned, the casting for the first series was flawless), I love them all. In ""Further Tales..."" I do find the whole Jim Jones storyline a stretch, as I did with the book and I find that so much time is spent with Prue that I end up missing the rest of the 28 Barbary Lane characters. But, all in all, ""Further Tales..."" is certainly better than most of what you see on television and a delight. I'm more than ready for mini-series #4, ""Babycakes""."
2,"Good Story, Bad DVD","I love Tales of the City and I wish they would reissue a DVD set that actually works. I can not even watch it to the end. Like others, the DVD starts to constantly freeze and I have a very good DVD player. I think customers should be aware that this set is flawed and they will not get what they paid for: A DVD that actualy works. Very disappointing."
1,Not as shown and defective.,Failed out of the box. Had to return.Absolutely hate when a product is shown with OEM packingand is shipped in generic packaging. Happens more andmore with Amazon.NOTE: All Delta products are Guaranteed for Life. Ididn't need this because Delta gave it to me for free.They even paid the shipping.
2,Too difficult for age recommendation,"We were not impressed by this toy. It is a great concept for the bathtub toys, but it's hard for even an adult to make a basket in the small square opening."
2,Disappointing and frustrating,I bought 2 sets of these for my boys for Christmas and they are really a net idea. The problem is that the hoop is VERY heavy and doesn't stick to the wall. It constantly falls down and the boys get really frustrated. I end up holding it for them (so much fun for me). The balls are fun and cute (and easy for little hands to squeeze) but the hoop is really a piece of trash. There are better bath toys out there- save your money!
4,Bigger Than Yourself,"In the CD ""Bigger Than Yourself"" songwriter and musician John McCutcheon and Si Kahn have written all 15 songs, from the opening song ""I Got a Dime"" to the closing song ""Bigger Than Yourself"". This album is all about friendship, leadership, sticking up for people, and sticking together. John McCutcheon took all of this kids music that could change the world and played it without dumbing it down BECAUSE it is kids music. In conclusion, this is great music to listen to, and learn from!"
3,Needed Repair,"I bought this ""reconditioned"" machine and when I first used it I found that it leaked.I found the source of the leak and was able to seal it with a sealant.Since then it has worked fairly well. Be aware, however, that it is not a ""steam"" cleaner.It uses hot water but there is no heater to produce steam."
4,Refreshed and Clean Carpets,This carpet cleaner is easy to use for all ages. It totally refreshed our bedroom and hall carpeting which is over 35 years old and only has had periodic cleaning. This cleaner is lightweight and I can refresh the carpets as often as I want. It's great!
4,Not bad for the price,"All in all its a good carpet cleaner, not as powerful as the ones you rent but it does the job, totally worth the price I paid. Definatley a must if you live in a rental and have pets it saves alot of money down the road."
1,No power,The cleaner is horrible. All it does is get my floor wet. There is no power to pick up the dirk and the lip it comes in at is too small. i would spend the money to get a better one
3,"Soda stereo is great, but.....","The thing that bugs me about this one is that it is a live recording and it doesn't say that on the cover or the description. I think the studio versions sound better.But don't be misled by this review..Soda Stereo was one of the greatest latin rock bands ever. If you are a first time listner or a moderate admirer I would reccomend the ""Chau Soda"" record instead. Even the selection on this one doesn't do justice to them..they have even better tunes."
