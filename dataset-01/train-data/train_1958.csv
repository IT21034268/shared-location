5,Awesome boots,"I have had several pairs of bearpaw boots and have never been disappointed! They are super comfy, cute, and definitely more affordable than other competitors.The soles offer traction: great for rainy/snowy days in unpredictable chicago weather!"
4,Warm and Comfortable Boots,"These boots are a beautiful, rich deep green and the perfect color I wanted. Unless you are looking for olive, true forest green is difficult to find. BEARPAW boots wear well and I still have a pair I purchased four years ago. The only minor drawback for me is that I wear a 7.5. In this brand, a 7 is fine except not with socks, but an 8 is too large. I purchased the 7. These seem to run just a little smaller than other boots and something to consider when buying. Overall, I am happy with them."
5,LOVE THE BOOTS,"Love the boots...great style, great quality, great price. Purchased for my daughter-in-law for Christmas. Know she will love them. Fast shipping. Santa's Helper."
5,Great!!,Since I slipped an broke leg last year these will give me good chance not to repeat! Little snug but that better than to big They'll stretch!! Great price
2,Too Small,Like the boot... hate the fit. Too bad... it seemed like a winner.I could not get my foot in it.
5,Great Product from Amozon,Great looking boots very pleased with the quality for the price. One thing is they do run a little small. I ordered a size larger then I normally wear and they fit like a glove. Very happy with this purchase.
3,Eh.,I like that they're cute and not very heavy. However I don't like that there's no seams around the entry of the boot. You can see where both the fur and the brown part of the boot are connected and there's nothing covering it.. Looks good from afar though.
5,My New Favorite Boot!,I had originally purchased a size 9 (I wear a size 8 shoe) but because I like to wear thick socks with my boots and it was tough getting them on I returned the size 9's and got the 10's. They're perfect. They are so comfortable and cute as heck. I'm very happy with my purchase as well as the speed of delivery.
1,Knock Off,"We had to request a replacement pair due to damage to our original order. The replacements they sent were clearly not up to the quality of the original boots ordered. Colors off, fur lining different, soles different, even logos very simplistic compared to the originals. Very unsatisfied. We opted to keep our original damaged pair and have them repaired at our expense. Buyers Beware..."
5,Yummy warm boots!,I bought these to wear after I skate. The color is perfect match for practice jacket. Thank you BEARPAW! You are the best!
3,Sole Needs Improvement,"Comfy boot and good in cold weather, but wish it had better grips on soles for better footing in ice and snow."
5,Great alternative to Uggs,These seem to run half size smaller than the Emma style which I also bought @ Amazon. For $35 on sale who wouldn't love them. They are stylish and warm but feet don't sweat at the office. They may not be Ugg quality but they aren't Ugg price and they are cuter. Only worn 3 times so not sure about longevity.
5,LOVE THESE BOOTS!,"So, my husband and I have never been fans of boots like this, mainly because of the ""type' of girls we're used to seeing wearing Ugs. We'll, I really wanted to get my (2 yr old) daughter some comfy, warm boots for fall/winter and a friend of mine recommended Bearpaw. I got her a pair and she loved them so much that I got myself these. I LOVE THEM! They are so comfy and warm! I try to wear them as much as I can, especially since I'm almost 7 mos preggers. The only thing is, I had to go up two sizes! It's not because I'm pregnant either. I still wear my normal size 7 shoe in all my other shoes...it's because of the thick lining. Would highly recommend these and really like the fact they're about 1/2 as much as Ugs and they're really made of the same material."
3,Craftmanship poor,"The boots are for my daughter and they are warm and comfortable, however, she wore them once to church and two of the buttons fell off. Fortunately she able to go back and find them. When I started to sew them back on I realized they were all very loose and sewn on very poorly. Now that all the buttons are secure and I waterproofed them we should be good to go for the winter season. My first purchase of a Bearpaw product next time I will check them over well before I buy them."
3,Disappointed in Texas,"These cute boots arrived looking perfect - just as the chill has set in. I was very disappointed to find out that I could barely get into them, despite ordering true to size according to Bearpaw and Amazon's sizing guidelines.These run small, especially if you have high arches/ insteps. Also where the sheepskin overlaps inside the boot is scratchy from the stitching, not a big deal if you wear socks (which you shouldn't as you'll miss out on the lovely sheepskin) but very uncomfortable on bare ankles. Sadly I had to send them back, and will be ordering a different style :-("
5,Adore this boot!,This boot is so cute! I was hesitant at first because some of the reviews said the buttons came off but I haven't had any problems with that. It's super comfy and fits pretty well. A little tight at first (I ordered my usual size 8) but this kind of boot usually stretches out so I'm not worried about it. I'm so glad I ordered these. They are just what I was looking for.
2,Had to return them....,Just received these boots yesterday. They're very cute but run very small. I wear a size 7 in all shoes but in this boot my toes were cramped. I cannot wear them for more than 2 minutes without pain. Sending them back today.
2,BEWARE of this boot,"got them this am,shipping them back this pm.Chinese cr*p.Ordered two sizes larger than I wear,shaft/instep area too narrow,can;t get dumb foot into shoe area.Of course this was the problem with LL BEAN and Uuggs,expense and junk from china,they made their money,forget they are JUNK,and don't fit.Got artic packs,old but in good shape and MADE IN USA,guess I'll forget about boots this winter.BY the way those little side buttons are totally worthless decorations of no value.Beware and good luck."
3,Bear paw boots,"I couldn't wait to get these, but on the first day wearing them the toggle fell off the left boot. I currently have clear tape to hold it on. Don't feel like sending them back, so I am just going to keep them and super glue the toggle on."
4,boots,A little bit tight... but its cute tho!I messaged them and never messaged me back!!it came on time!!
5,Awesome boots !!!!,These boots were an amazing buy !!! I'm so glad I purchased these !! I was worried since I wear an 8 1/2 what size I should get 8 or 9 .. I ended up getting a 9 ad they fit perfectly :) I recommend these boots to anyone and everyone ... Great boots for the price !!!
3,Good quality and comfy but not as cute as I expected,"These boots are true to size and comfy, but not the look I was expecting. I imagined the ""buttons"" were just decorative when in fact they are what hold the front flap and back flap together by an elastic loop. This makes the top of the boot really wide if the elastic gets stretched out from putting them on. If you're ok with having to readjust them every time you put them on/walk around in them a while they are very very comfy."
3,Size,"These boots are very narrow and you need to order a size up if you have wide feet like I do. I didn't get these again I bought the emma ones instead in 9, usually I am an 8 or 81/2, and they fit perfectly :)"
2,Hard to get on,"I wanted these to fit so badly! Unfortunately, I couldn't get my foot all the way into the boot. I was hoping I would be able to easily slide in and out of them. I didn't even have socks on. Now I'll have to return them for a different style."
4,good value,"I bought these boots after my favorite style of EMU boots were discontinued this year - rather than price up to UGGs I decided to give slightly lower priced Bearpaw a try. They are sized small - I usually wear 6 1/2 or 7 and needed an 8 - the 7 was tight in the arch across the top of my foot. The 8s are a big roomy in the toe but I would still recommend sizing up. They could use a little more support in the sole, but otherwise they are quite comfortable, very warm and I have gotten lots of compliments. I am satisfied with my purchase, and will buy this brand again."
2,"Pretty from a distance, but up close...not so much","I got a great deal on these when they were a lightning deal. They are soft and pretty...from a distance. The stitching is uneven and cheap looking. And, they aren't the most comfortable thing to walk in, they rub against your ankles. Definitely an impulsive purchase I regret."
5,Great!,The boots I ordered completely met my expectations. The boots were well made and of good quality. I know some people complained that they ran small. They were a little snug at first but after putting them on a few times they fit perfectly. I am a size 8 if that helps any. I love the bear paw brand and ordered another pair of black knit boots.
3,Not exactly like the picture,the boots were almost like the picture. they didnt have the two bungee straps on the inner ankle side of them. but other than that they are great.
1,Defects galore!,"I bought these as a gift for my girlfriend... needless to say a man should not have to go out and buy a make up gift because the boots were not up to par. Exchanged 4 times, all four times there were issues. I do not blame Amazon on this one, they have worked very hard at making this right. Buttons falling off, seams not matched up, fur missing in sections, as well as one that already had the sole coming apart in two areas. I could not recommend these to anyone. Pay the extra and get Uggs."
5,Love Them!!!!,I love these boots!!! I've had the black ones for a while and always wanted to get a second pair... They are so comfy and keep your feet very warm.. The best!!!
3,very nice,this boot is very nice but DONT GET IT WET. Also the buttons fall off easily. I had to put them back on like 10 times and but 2 new ones.
4,Picture Deceiving,The picture shows the hook and loop opening on both sides... it is only on one side. I had seen someone else's complaint about the same thing but the naive me thought that it was fixed!! NOPE.. still showing the wrong pix!!! Other than that I had a great experience. Arrived on time and they look like a sturdy boot that is comparable to Uggs without the high price. We will see how they last after Christmas!!
4,Cute and warm,"These boots are cute, warm, and comfortable. I would highly recommend this product, a little tight for size you may want to go up a size."
5,Adorable! Perfect Color!,"I got these boots for my daughter for Christmas (14yr.) She loves them and so do I. So comfy and really cute. The color is just what she was wanting. Price was right, too!"
5,love it,very real cheap and worth the buy.my daughter loves them it at times is better to wait for a mail order in order to save money.
2,Buttons immediately fell off,I bought these for me daughter and the first time she went to wear them the lower button on one boot came off because it was just held on by a simple knot of nylon rope. After wearing them on a car ride the lower button of the other boot fell off when she went into the house for the same reason. The boot material seems good but the method used to secure the buttons is horrible. I will try and repair them and if that doesn't work I'll be sending them back.
5,Great boots,I ordered these for my 14 yr old daughter. She absolutely loves them. She says they are very comfortable - like walking on clouds. They look really good on her and keep her feet nice and warm. I would definitely recommend these boots.
3,Not crafted well,Love the boot but the craftmanship is not so good.. after wearingthe boot about 10 times the straps broke on the side of the boot. Also looks like another one is about to break as well. Wish i would have bought the ones without the buttons...
1,Fell completely apart!,I have worn these boots twice and the entire bottom of one shoe has come off! They are very comfortable and if they did not fall apart they would be great...too bad they were a huge waste of money. VERY DISAPPOINTED!
2,Disappointed,"I am a huge Bear paw fan.. 1 bc they are cheaper than uggs and 2 bc they are just as comfortable and durable. I thought this item was ok.. didnt care for how the lining looked felt it was a little cheap compared to my other bearpaws.. Also, the stupid buttons were missing or about to fall off. So that was a big let down. But still a fan of bearpaw..just felt this shoe was to cheaply made"
4,"First-time buyer, love these boots","I spent about a week going back and forth deciding what boots I wanted to purchase. I'm glad I bought these! The color is a classic, and it goes with everything. My school's colors are gold and black and I was worried that the gold and hickory wasn't going to mix very well, but it looks just fine. I'm a size 7 and I bought a size 8 because other reviewers said that if you wear a thicker sock, there would be room for your toes. I have to agree! They're so warm and cozy! I didn't give this product five stars because the shaft of the boot is kind of wide. It's awkward for me to fold my pants into them and it feels strange. So I wear skinny jeans, sweatpants, or I just don't fold my jeans into them. The sheepskin is starting to get worn down, so I'll just have to buy new insoles. I also bought Kiwi Suede protector and it hasn't failed me! If you reviewers have questions, please let help me help you!"
3,Not Pleased,"When I opened the box I was excited. That is until further inspection I noticed there was a stain on the boot. I know what your saying, ""Maybe it was a natural discoloration. No it was sticky. After inspecting the boots further I noticed one of the buttons was hanging on by a thread. I fixed it and decided to try them out for a day. Well I got halfway through work and didn't realize one of the buttons came off. Before leaving that morning I checked to make sure the others were okay. Long story short I sent them back. Funny thing is I own a pair of these same boots. Got them for Christmas from my sister. I did have a problem with the buttons being loose on those as well. Ended up having to take those to a tailor to fix. Cost me $4. They even secured the other button that I didn't know was loose. They are a nice but. In the future I'll stick to the ones I slide my feet in."
1,stinky!!!!,"size and color were exactly as expected. The smell, however, is nasty! I returned them after trying to let them air out for 1 week, but the smell was so strong and nasty, everybody could still smell them. If you enjoy the smell of cat crap, these are the boots for you."
4,Love them!,They are so warm!! However I bought these for the snow and so far it has not snown...lol I will for sure buy more BEARPAW boots in the future! Size wise the are spot on!!
4,Cuter design and run 1 size bigger,"The shoes is as same as the website described. The shoe quality is good. BearPaw design is more cuter comparing with UGG and EMU. The size is run 1 size bigger. The lining is soft and fluffy, thinner than authentic UGG and EMU. The shoe is heavier than UGG and EMU. The sole is heavier than UGG and EMU, more rubber felling. It might be better in the snow or winter wet area. ( I don't know, my mom said so).BMW, this is the 1st Amazon partner contact me after I return the shoes. Comparing the others, I feel they are real and responsible for their product. I will buy this company's product again."
4,Love my boots!,Very comfortable and warm. Better than I thought they'd be. No difference between these and UGGS is the price. Bargain!
5,Wonderful! I Love my new boots,I love these boots. We just had an unexpected cold front and these boots really did the trick. They are very warm and cute too.
2,Disappointed.,These boots did not go on as easy as I thought they would. My daughter has a pair and she did not have to struggle to get them on like I did. I wanted a pair that would go on very easily but these did not.
4,Very Warm,"I like these. They are very warm, I wear them without any socks and have been comfortable at the hockey rink watching my sons games. They are great for the price!"
3,Okay But Doesn't Wear Well,"In 2010, I bought my first pair of Abigails. They were very plush and soft and warm, and I loved them. Unfortunately, a week into wearing them, one of the little triangular knobby things on the side came right off. I didn't wear them in any sort of abusive way, but *Plink!* off it went. I wrote back to the company, and they sent me another pair, albeit in a color I don't usually wear. So I am trying again. And guess what: *Plink!"" off came one of the triangular knooby closure things again. While I am not slender, I do not have unusually-sized legs, so I am not sure what is happening here. But I am just going to suck it up and wear them.I bought another pair from Amazon in late 2011, and the same thing happened -- the triangular knob came off. I give up. Maybe this style just doesn't work for me, though I am mystified as to what I am doing wrong."
2,wrong size shipped,Even the stores like TJ Maxx check to make sure the boot inside the box matches the label on the outside of the box! Size 8 boots inside a size 6 marked box. Really disappointed child for Xmas.
5,Second pair,Purchased a pair at Christmas for myself from my boyfriend then got another pair same brand in different color. Boots are comfortable soft warm...just what I wanted
2,Size runs small,Pretty cute boot but It was a whole shpe size smaller than mineorder a size up if you get these
5,Warmest boots ever worn!,These are my first pair of warm boots that I have purchased. I absolutely LOVE them and do not want to take them off ever. I live in Michigan and it has been bitter cold here. Buying these boots was a big deal to me because $60 is a lot of money to spend on something in our household. I would definitely recommend these boots to anyone in need of warmth and comfort!
3,They don't look like the picture.,Just got these today but they don't look like the ones shown. Kind of bummed about that because the ones pictured are super cute! Plus the button was falling off when I took them out of the packaging. BearPaw is a comfortable boot however the quality is lacking on the last 2 pairs I have bought. If this keeps up I may go to another boot.
2,Low quality construction,"Elastic loop that goes around side toggle broke the FIRST time my daughter wore these boots. I expected a lot more wear and tear than this, even if these boots are less expensive than Uggs."
2,Products with different quality!,"I brought 2 pair of bearpaw from the owner but they are of different quality. This one is with hard fur and the size is right. Another pair of boot is the same size of the Camel color. However the Camel one is with soft fur but the size is a little small. And the first time I try the Camel one on, one of it's button fall off. Now I have sewn the button on by myself."
5,great value for the money,i bought these for myself. i was going to buy uggs but they r so expensive n i saw these n they r pretty much the same thing for a lot less money! i love these they to me r the same as uggs just as comfortable n warm but like i said for a fraction of the cost great value for the money!!
5,Bearpaw Abigail size runs small,"Love these but was very disapointed when they were to small for my daughter. I lost track of xmas gifts and had also bought her another pair in different color and a size 8, they were to small. My daughter wears a size 7 and is only 10 years old. These run very small in size. Other wise they are very good boots. I am returning both pair for an exchange in size 9."
4,Bearpaw Abigail,"I got these boots for my teenage grandaughter for Christmas. She wanted Uggs, but we just didn't see putting that much money in them. I thought these looked just as good. The quality is great. When she opened the package she was thrilled. They fit nicely, the color was just as it looked on the site. She loves them. They keep her warm and toasty."
3,smellin issue,Has anyone had them smell like a skunk? I got them wore them onelce withvsock for an hour and kept smelling something awful I get home and hubby says something smells and I figure out its the dang boots. I'm so sad because they look and feel great. But will the smell go away or is mine the.onyl ones that had the issue?
5,Bought As A Gift,I bought them as a Christmas gift for my mom last year and she loves them. She says they are comfortable and warm plus stylish.
5,warm and comfortable,"the fur is pretty thick, and i would say its really warm and cozy. but it smells bad if i wear it for a long time. donno why"
1,Got my boots,The quality of the boots weren't the same as in the store. I don't like knock of brands. The glue on the bottom is sticking out. I bought them for my mom for a Christmas present and I'm emberesed give them to her.
2,Shoe Mall no,"This is not a review of Birkenstock socks. I have been buying those socks for years and they are great. But Amazon uses Shoe Mall as the provider. That has been an unpleasant experience. Shoe Mall gave no size information on the product, so I was flying blind. I ordered twice and both times the socks were too small. My dissatisfaction with Shoe Mall is complete. I won't be buying from them again. Amazon should look for a different partner."
1,Street Tales of Terrible Moviemaking...,"This movie definately ranks as one of the worst straight-to-video horror movies of all times. Shot entirely on video, the camera angles and lighting are amateurish (it actually looks like a film that a high school kid with his first video camera and a bunch of friends would make). The stories themselves are boring rehashes of urban legends that have been told a million times before and a million times better. The acting is equally bad and appears to have made full use of the local high school or junior college acting class (though the actor who plays the bum is actually kinda funny)Ignore the ""awards"" cited on the front of the DVD - I was sucked in by them, thinking that there must be SOMETHING good and/or scary in this movie. But, no. Save your money and your time. Do not rent, and certainly do not buy, this one..."
2,Uneven,"Since this movie was done for about a third of the budget of the ultra low budget Blair Witch, one can't be too harsh. Street Tales has its moments. The 1st story with the three little girls is actually pretty good, the acting, camera shot selections as well as the story.But there are other parts of the movie where the shot selections were very amateurish. Waaaaaaay too many wide angle shots in the last story. And whats with the shot of the hand carrying a cup all away across the room. This lasts for 32 seconds and was the most boring shot I've seen in my life.I've seen other reviews that blamed the script for the problems of this film but anyone with any ounce of knowledge in the industry knows that shot selection can kill a movie/scene just like poor staging can kill a play.In fairness, there were points where the shot selection was good and others where you wonder what were the director and camera man thinking. Very uneven"
3,Better than many other black ghost story collections,"This movie is actually more funny than scary, but the stories from this movie will surprise you and keep you interested. It's actually a story within a story: an old man is telling ghost stories to street thugs in order to keep them from killing him, and little do they know, they will end up living out the worse scary story of all."
2,Vintage or vinegar?,"This DVD did not appear on Louis L'Amour Official Web Site for a long time and I understand why now : so vintaged - [It does appear now at last!!! sept 2008].The stories are as good as any Louis always delivered :1. Hondo And The Apaches, with Ralph Traeger(1967) and2. The Man Called Noon (1972), with Richard Crenna.And I bought it thinking of Crossfire Trail, wih Tom Selleck, or The Quick and The Dead ,with Sam Elliott, with the usual expectations of a fine western.But the video is technically rather poor. You'll have to be a real he fan and pay the modest price asked if you want to enjoy it.An other DVD is available starring John Wayne as ""Hondo"" and is worth seeing [5 stars] and buying .The Duke is his usual self and the video is excellent."
2,"Love the movie, but hated the DVD","I bought this DVD solely for HONDO AND THE APACHES. I was a fan of the series around 1994 when TNT was airing it regularly. When they pulled it I missed it until this DVD came out. Boy was I sorry I bought it.The DVD looks like it was mastered from an old film print, maybe even an old VHS tape due to some of the print damage that looks like video-tape ""snow"" rather than damage to an old film print. On top of that, it should be 85 minutes long, and is only a mere 72 minutes. The quality of the other film, THE MAN CALLED NOON, is no better. I'm used to cheap budget DVDs, but when parts of the movie are missing, I have to complain."
1,Disappointed in Amazon,I expected to get a good quality movie in the Louis L'Amour-Hondo and the Apaches/The Man Called Noon. I was sadly disappointed in not only the very poor video but in 26 minutes of The Man Called Noon instead of a movie I got a poorly produced cut of it.
1,"the movies i would give a 3,but this transfer is a zero","the hondo movie is two shows from the hondo t.v. series,and i had never heard of the other. i did like both but the disc is so bad(washed out color,sound drops,and the look of a transfer from a video camera and t.v. screen)!!! if you want these look for better copies out there!!!!!"
1,LOUIS L'AMOUR: HONDO AND THE APACHES/THE MAN CALLED NOON,I did not read the other reviews of this DVD when I purchased it. I wish I had. To call it a poor copy of a well used VHS tape that was rescued from the trash would be a compliment. I have purchased DVD's for a $1 that had a better picture and audio quality than this one.The Man Called Noon runs for 27 minutes and research shows that it is a 98 minute movie. Will be asking to return for a refund.Louis L'Amour: Hondo and the Apaches/The Man Called Noon
1,do not buy - bad copy of the movies,"Got the movie, put it in the dvd player and it seems to start ok. Not searchable though. But about 10 minutes into it, it just cuts back to the beginning again. Can't watch it at all. Very poor quality if this was copied from an old vhs or similar media.I was buying this as my dad is a very big Louis L'Amour fan and wants all his movies now. Have to be a little more careful when purchasing it seems. Watch out where you get this from. Got mine from S&M;'sBargainBuys."
1,DOA,"Where to begin... I had a VHS copy of this a long time ago, it was lousy, but I thought it was just ""the nature of the beast"", so to speak. I was hoping that because this was advertised as being remastered, it would be nearly pristine. Guess what? Just as lousy a print as the VHS was. I don't blame either AMAZON or the company that I purchased it through. I received it in good time and the packaging was quite good. It was the print itself that was worse than anyone could expect for a DVD. I returned it for a refund and received the refund in rapid ""turn around"" time. All in all I would recommend both AMAZON and the company that I purchased it from , HIGHLY. Can't expect any better service than what they provided. Certainly they had no way of knowing that the print of the movie was of very very low quality. I'm truly disappointed that some companies are purveyers of such junk. I wish I could remember the name of THAT company so I could warn you about them. I hope this review helped you."
3,L'Amour Western,"One of my favorite Louis L'Amour stories was ""The Man Called Noon"". Needless to say, the DVD did not do it justice. The quality of ""The Sacketts"" production was not there. The story was just fair. I was, to be blunt, disappointed. It made a fair gift to a man who loved Westerns."
3,NOT a CD-ROM,"I'm leaving an average rating, because this is not a comment on the product, but rather the listing. Amazon has listed this item as a CD-ROM; it is not. It is a two CD set. If you are thinking about buying this, please be aware. Personally, I dislike audio books and would not have purchased it had I known."
5,Incredibly good book,"Just have to say its an incredibly good book on dogs. Those of us who love dogs sometimes sit around at shows endlessly analyzing gait. This book is a professional way to do it, but written so well that amateurs can understand and be interested. Good for all breeds, but if you have a dog in performance events, like hunting, coursing, running, or agility, you need this book. Or, if you have a breed prone to hip dysplasia, like Rotties or Dobes, you need this book."
1,Poor animated adaption of a great story,"This animated version fails on several levels. First, it seriously draws from some writer's fancy and not from the original story. Certainly all film adaptions do this to some extent, but the 'new' information in this version either changes characters completely, or don't even make logical sense. Very poor job with the writing of this--strongly appears to be a 'rush job' done during an all-nighter by a few college students. Two, the animation and voices are simply awful. Many of the cartoons from the 1960s--ten years earlier than this was produced--are far superior. The voice talents are weak, the animation is sticky looking, and the film has an annoying gritty look to it that makes it difficult to watch and impossible to enjoy. Perhaps another attempt would be made as this story is currently enjoying renewed interest. This version has been on life-support for too long already."
5,Excellent book for little girls,"The illustrations in this book are incredible! I could just look at the pictures and enjoy the story. However, the story itself is also wonderful. It follows the dreams of a young girl, then shows at the end some came true. I bought this book for my 9 year old niece, she loved reading it to me!"
3,Not as good as When I Was a Boy I Dreamed,"This book is co-authored and is much different than ""When I Was a Boy I Dreamed"" The words and phrases are much harder to read aloud and I get tongue-tied really quick, as if they wrote the verses without having tried saying them outloud. THe words are also for older readers with a larger vocabulary. However, the artwork is amazing."
1,They ruin Nosferatu+give horrible transfers to House+Night,"This DVD pack looks and soudns like a good deal, it even has the man himself, Vincent Price on the front. How can you pass up these three absolute classics of horror in one DVD for this very low price. How? I'll tell you how, first it is like you've purchased the VHS versions of each film as they are extremely grainy and have poor sound quality. Next there are no special features so it might as well be a VHS anyway. Third and to me, biggest of them all, they have ruined Nosferatu, a class film from the silent era by adding heavy metal music to it!?!?!?!?!?!?!? What are they thinking, I'll be selling this DVD first chance I get, I suggest you avoid having to do the same by never purchasing it."
5,Let No Man Write My Epitaph,"The remarkable thing about this enormously powerful book is that it was written in 1959, yet, it could have been today... nothing has changed, the homosexuality of one of the Uncles went over my head, reading it back then, today I understand it so totally, as well as the heroin addiction. And since ""not I Not anyone can walk that road for you, you must walk it for yourself... I now read Walt Whitman. If you can get your hands on a copy do so you won't be sorry... an extremely powerful and moving book, written in 1959 about problems of today.."
4,Poker CHIPS- WHAT AN INVESTMENT,"I am very glad with these chips, they are exactly what I was looking for."
4,Decent Poker Chips,"I got these for our game down at the VFW and I'm delightfully surprised at the quality and feel of these chips. They are not cheaply made as I suspected. The design is very basic...you are not going to WOW anyone with these. However, if you are looking for a great poker chip that has the right weight and feel, then these are a must buy! They hold up well under high usage and they make the great clinking sound of higher end poker chips. The only flaw I have found is the case. It is a very very cheap case. I will probably buy a better case and give this one to my 5 year old son to play with."
3,I WAS THERE,"I saw the bombers fly over the camps and we waived to them.At another camp they flew low over us, bombed the factory (BRABAG at Zeitz) just by our fence and sent no bombs to liberate us inside the fence. Even our guards have fled. I ducked when the shrapnels started flying but oh how welcome the attack was.Lets face it no one in power REALLY gave a... If we were all British or American troups being exterminated THE CAMPS AND RAILROADS WOULD HAVE BEEN BOMBED TO SMITHERENES./It is a sad chapter, not even the FDR Museum at Hyde Park hasa good explanation except to refer to this book. It was FDR' decision not to bomb, as evidence now emerges in a recent article in NEWSWEEK magazine by Beshloss."
3,WARNING,"I just received my set and let me warn you: All pieces are stamped 18/0! False advertising; I can't even tell you how disappointed I am after so much searching and finally settling on what I thought would be the perfect set. Luckily, Amazon has always been wonderful as far as customer service goes."
4,almost a 5,"I bought this knife for my dad for fathers day some years back. It has undergone infrequent use but has met all tasks. The gut hook blade made short work of the two caribou we caped and the the hunting knife performed all field butchering requirement without a problem. The saw blade is very sharp and fine enough to make cutting leg bones and splitting rib cages a breeze. The blades come extremely sharp and hold an edge reasonably well. The only reason this is not a 5 star rating is because it doesn't compare to the custom knives I own and have used. I don't know how the ""Quick-Lock"" mechanism will hold up over extended heavy use. I love my custom hunting knives but for 1/4 the $$ I don't think you will be dissapointed. I love this knife for most hunting situations but If I was going out on a long back country excursion I would still carry a good full tang hunting knife just incase the Quick-lock failed."
2,Is this hot chocolate or cough medicine,The flavor of this hot chocolate might not be all that bad if it were a medicine and not a beverage. The taste is not that great and it certainly is not premium.
1,TARGETS,Product is just what I ordered but the shipper put the wrong address on it so a guy about 6 blocks away received it and called me. Luckily they right phone number was on the box.
5,MUCH MORE THAN YOUR AVERAGE ANTHOLOGY!,"This is a wonderful group of interconnected stories, centered around a huge, ornately carved bed and its history with the Masterson family. Each story is a little gem all by itself. These are *hot* reads to be sure, but with the sort of to-die-for heroes and heroines you expect in longer books. I was only sad the book was so short. When you read the last story and see how cleverly it all ties together, you just want to go back and start all over again."
4,Surprising Emotional Depth,"In Once Upon A Pillow expert novelists Christina Dodd and Connie Brockway have taken an unusual idea and created a provocative anthology. Covering medieval, Elizabethan, Regency and contemporary times, they follow the passionate and amusing 800-year history of a very special bed.Every story is fast-paced, entertaining and full of surprising emotional depth, given that they average only 80 pages each. Characters are brought to life with humor and passion, and their witty repartee is fun to read.Though I prefer novel-length treatment of stories, I enjoyed this anthology more than I'd have ever expected. Dodd and Brockway have a way of turning anything they write into a delightful adventure through the fascinating range of human emotions, culminating in a satisfying feeling of genuine love."
1,Very Misleading beware ther is NO GUITAR TAB IN THI BOOK!!,"This book is a play-along? It is if you can read Music,Almost all play-along books come with Guitar Tab Not Written Music most guitar players know what tab is and can read it.These books are suppose to help you learn the songs listed and have fun playing them as well.Unless you are a music major you will be lost and also loose the money you have spent to get this book.This book was and is highly misleading in the way it is presented so take my advise and if you are giving this book as a gift DON""T it is a waste of time money and who ever should get it will put it away and look at the waste of money they spent.Just buy them the C.D. it will be more fun for them.God what a wast of time and money"
3,Two problems,"I have two major problems with this book. As many have already mentioned, there are no maps, which is a travesty for a military history book. Second, the author doesn't even attempt to present an even-handed, impartial evaluation of Grant. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Grant fan, but I'm not a historian writing books. Woodworth's approach to Grant is almost worship-full (if that's a word), similar to Freeman's treatment of Lee and Stackpole's treatment of Jackson."
5,Nothing But Insight,"Nothing But Victory is a good history of the Civil War in the West, the Atlanta Campaign, and Sherman's marches through Georgia and the Carolinas. This book is strongest up through the end of the Vicksburg campaign. The Army's progress from groups of naive civilians to veteran soldiers through their early experiences at Belmont, Forts Henry and Donelson, and the terrible ordeal at Shiloh is detailed and well researched. There is a good description of Sherman's little known Meridian campaign that foreshadowed the March to the Sea. The passage on the Battle of Atlanta is a great narrative of the Army's eventually victorious reaction to its third great surprise during the war, the others being at Fort Donelson, and at Shiloh."
4,THE LUNATICS ARE THE BEST!!!!,"FIRST, I WANT TO SAY THIS ALBUM IS WONDERFUL!!! I AM LISTENIN' TO IT RIGHT NOW. THIS IS SUCH A HOT CD. I GIVE THE LUNATICS 4 STARS FOR THIS ALBUM. I BOUGHT IT ON IT'S FIRST DAY OF BEIN' RELEASED AND I AM VERY PLEASED. THE WHOLE ST.LUNATIC CREW IS VERY TALENTED. ALL FIVE OF THEM CAN RAP. THE BEATS ARE GREAT AND IT'S NOT TOO SIMILAR TO ""COUNTRY GRAMMAR"". SONGS SUCH AS ""DIS IZ DA LIFE"", ""SUMMER IN THE CITY"", ""LET ME IN NOW"", AND ""MIDWEST SWING"" JUST MAKE ME WANNA DANCE. THE SONG ""GROOVIN' TONIGHT"" W/BRIAN MCKNIGHT IS A SONG YOU CAN CRUISE TO IN YOUR CAR OR JUST KICK BACK TO. THE PRODUCTION WAS DONE VERY WELL AND THE BEATS ARE JUST BANGIN'. IF YOU BOUGHT NELLY'S ""COUNTRY GRAMMAR"" ALBUM AND YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT ""FREE CITY"" GO PICK UP ""FREE CITY"" 'CAUSE YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."
5,Nelly/Lunatics,"This album is tight fo sho. Murphy Lee, and Ali really make this cd awesome, then you got nellys beats in their too. So it makes the cd even more better.STL #1 fo sho"
5,From STL to The N.O,"The St.Linatics are the new rising stars from St.Louis,MO. The CD is up lifting in many ways. I personally like it better than any album out. So If you're a St.Lunatics fan like me you would go and buy it today!~!!!"
4,Great summer CD but not a classic,"This album is tight from the lyrics to the beats. At the begining I thought it might not be as good as Country Grammar, but after listening to it for awhile it is just as good if not better. Nelly does have the best lyrical skill but the others are not far from him. All of the Lunatics have their own style, after listening to this you understand that they each put in enough to make themselves stand out from the croud of rap groups out there. It sounds like Country Grammar II but with the Lunatics. That is not a bad thing but if you want something new then don't look here. If you like Country Grammar then you should go get this joint fast cause it is hot! it is a good first attempt from the Lunatics I was not dissapointed."
1,these dudes are wack,"If you know anything about hip hop, you know these guys are bunk...they will be around for about 15 more minutes....nuff said"
2,Not good,"They take the chance that could've made the St. Lunatics a modest musical presence. But they just run this one strait into the ditch. The production on these songs were pretty good nice bass lines, nice flowing instruments. Though the lyrics were absolutely pathetic. They just rattle off about riding around St. Louis smokeing doobies. Every song boils down to that basic diagram, Which makes every track on this album sound like a filler song. Not to mention the fact that Nelly is featured in every freaking song. The St. Lunatics do have some skill, but they need to release a much more developed album. Possibly distance themselves from Nelly just a bit more in their next release. Mabe just have him featured in 6 songs."
1,Lunatics? HAHAHAHA,"These fruitcakes aint lunitics, hell they arnt even 5% loony. The only quality these morons posess is the ability to put out the most POP MTV TRL SUPER BOWL rap ever to hit the streets. If these loosers got into a street brawl with a bunch of 10 year olds i'd be throwin down 100's on the little kids. This is sad, what the hell happened to rap??"
1,st lunatics,This album is an example of poorly put together music. Nelly is good but the rest of them suck really bad. I could rap better than some of the St. Lunatics. Production sucks and the lyrics are wack. Don't buy this album.
2,I must be the only one,"i must be the only one that doesnt like this cd. It is nothing like Nelly's cd. The first 6 songs should not even be on the album. My reasons for this is because they have no beat, the lyrics suck, and you cant bump to any of em. The cd starts to get better at 7 with Midwestern Swing and goes strong til 11. But after that it starts to drop off again. I think the St. Lunatics are a great group, but i think they tried to get to much money with this cd. I think they should have spent more time on the tracks. Its not a cd that i would listen to a lot but if you are a rap fan or a nelly fan buy it just to have it in your collection."
1,Weak,This album is another example of a weak album. Nelly is good but the rest of the St. Lunatics are really really weak. The beats again are poorly produced and hooks are annoying and not creative. Out of all the songs on the album only about 3 or 4 are actually worth listening to. Don't waste your money on this album because it's just not worth it.
1,Shouldn't even get one.,"Nelly is not hip hop. He's a pop rapper. Garbage, and now he goes to grab his group who try to rap like him. We don't need any more Nelly. What happened to real hip hop? We need the Common's and the Nas' to rise up. Nas is finally doing it like he should, but I fear that it has come too little too late. People need to bring back real hip hop that means something. This album as well as all of Nelly's others are terrible, definetly not recommended for somebody who is into 'real' hip hop. This cd is a waste of money."
1,ST. LUNATICS?? MUHAHAHAH,"This is the most commercialized you will get. Don't even bother with this TRL rap. I'm sorry to be so harsh, but after seeing Nelly on the super bowl half time show with britney spears and nsync, that really did it for me. That in my eyes is a SELLOUT. You want a good cd, then go pick up Both Sides Of The Brain by Del The Funky Homosapien..Don't even bother with this pop rap..peace.."
5,This CD is off the hook!,"This CD is so tight. I like the songs espically 2,3,4,5,7,9,10,and 16. Those are mostly all of the songs. But I gave it the first 2 stars because of Nelly. He is just so TIGHT! The next 2 stars are for originallity. The last star is because it is just tight all over. Some people think rappers are all negative. Just because there is cussing in the songs doesn't mean that the people or the song is bad. Actually I like every single 1. If you are a fan of the St. Lunatics,rap,or Nelly,you would really really like this album. THIS is 1 of the BEST Rap albums yet. GET IT!"
5,this is the best cd,at first i didn't think it would good i was wrong this cd has phat beatz and lycris u got to go buy this
4,Nelly's Back,"Free City is an awesome cd. I dont know if its as good as Country Grammar, Nelly's first, because thats one of my favorite cds...but still Free City is good. Nelly and his old STL friends are off the hook. I recommend it to anyone who liked Country Grammar."
1,0 stars,"I would give this album 0 stars if i could b/c this album doesn't live up to anying. ali, murphy lee, nelly and all of the st. lunatics are weak. they are not at all original and they are really boring. their flow is off and just everything is off, sorry st lunatics but better luck next time."
5,GREAT!,"This is a great all-around cd. Awesome beats, good rapping. Highly recommended for anyone who liked Nelly- Country Grammar. Its the Midwest Swing, y'all!!"
5,Hot S**T from the S.T.L,"Thsi album is one of the hottest cds around right now...You maybe thinking that this is just Nelly using his success to help his homies out, you couldn't be more wrong. In my opinion ""Free City"" is a better cd than ""Country Grammer."" Nelly is the best member of the Lunatics with Murphy lee ""The schoolboy"" coming in 2nd, but all members are great! The lyrics of the Lunatics aren't all that great but if it's lyrics you are after go buy a 2pac cd, here it is huge catchy basslines and cool party tracks (With the exception of ""Groovin tonite"".) The best tracks are... S.T.L, Summer in the city, Boom D Boom, Midwest Swing, Let me in now and Diz iz da life. All the other tracks are good (except ""Groovin Tonite"") So definetly pick up this lp from the ""Free City"""
5,Friggin' Fantastic,"I thought the new Tics cd was great. They are truly holdin' it down for the STL. This just goes to show that the rest of the country shouldn't sleepon St. Louis. Find out where we are because we have an amazing array of talent blooming in our city, and not just musically, but artistically. And not to hate on KC, the other side of the state because they've got some things going on over there too. I'm proud of the Tics and and I can't wait for the next single to come out."
4,pretty good overall,"This is a great cd. My favorite songs are summer in the city, S.T.L, and Midwest Swing. All the songs are pretty good, except scandelous where murphy lee seems to act like B.G. of Cash Money. But otherwise a great cd. This isn't tottaly dominated by Nelly, they all contribute pretty much equally. It has a warning label but is much less offensive and less crude then other cd's are. It only has one because they say n**ga and s*it a lot. I like this cd a lot, but i like country grammer better, but when i first got country grammer i didn't like it that much but i 2 day i couldn't turn it off. This isn't a waste of money at all, hip hop fans grab this now"
4,Representin'!!!,Ay y'all i'm feelin' this joint cuz its straight bangin'.Nelly and the Lunatics are holdin' it down for all of us in the Midwest.One love .Keep on reppin' fo us yo.Naptown ridin' on out!!
5,its a mid west thang,THEY DONE IT AGAIN THEM BIGGA []D [] []V[] []DS ITS A MID WEST THANG STL KEEPIN IT RREAL
5,Buy it,"I been waitin fo this Cd since summer in the city came out in december, and it's worth the wait. All the beats are tight. the best songs are Diz is da life, Midwest Swing, summer in the city, jang a lang, but all of em are good. Lunatics r representin the STL fo sho on this one."
3,No Sense of Fun,"""From Mouse to Mermaid"" is a delightful collection of essays analyzing a variety of aspects of Disney media. Most of the essays are indeed thought-provoking and insightful. However, many of the contributors take themselves far too seriously and draw spurrious conclusions. Simply put, they allow their determination to be scholarly critics to trump their sense of fun. As a Disney historian, I can safely say that several contributors come to conclusions that are simply not substantiated by the evidence. The contributors forget that Disney films, media, and parks are designed primarily to entertain, not to inculcate. The authors appear petty and eager to rip apart Disney (the man and the company), as if such an endeavor legitimized their humorless, pointless criticism."
1,Expert Quote-Mining and Distortion,"If you want to live in a sheltered, deluded world where everyone smart and talented is or was a Bible-thumping Christian (including Jefferson, Paine, Einstein and even Darwin, who repudiated evolution if you accept Federer's horrific distortions and quote-mines) then this is the book for you.I was honestly surprised to find that there's not a section on Bertrand Russell, trying to make it seem as if he too had a deathbead conversion or was *really* a Christian the whole time."
1,Federer just doesn't understand us Indians.,"The section on Christopher Columbus displays his own shallowness - he said in his letters that my ancestors ""had no religion"" and would therefore be easy to convert to Christianity. What Federer and many of his colleagues do not understand is that we Indians do not have a distinct word meaning ""religion"", because our traditional ""religion"" and everyday living were integrated. Wisely omitted from this book were quotations from George Custer (who committed suicide at the Battle of Little Bighorn), James Sheridan (""The only good Indian is a dead Indian"") and John Chivington (the minister-turned-soldier who led the U.S. Army in the Sand Creek Massacre). That's the only Kudos I give to Federer. Otherwise, this book belongs in the recycling bin."
3,Christian supremacy handbook,"I skimmed the copy of a friend and hope to read it in more detail soon. Usually, when a book has so many extremely positive reviews, it's a polemic or simple entertainment. I was disappointed to see the content is 90% white males. Among the token blacks Frederick Douglass received 1/4 the text of James Dobson. Who struggled and overcame more hardship? Women are covered, usually as appendages of a man, with some exceptions such as Helen Keller.Of course, this is not a collection of the complete writings of the Founders. The author picks and choses carefully to supply arguments implying we have always been and must need a theocracy of Judeo-Christianity. It is not balanced but is informative of a certain perspective - one that leaves out a significant input by women or natives or persons of color. I'd like to see an alternative equivalent - quotes against excessive religious zeal by some Founders and their contemporaries."
2,Nota Good Book if your looking for Spes,"This Book was ok if you just wanted to know what Artillery the Allies used. When I went to look for the specs, some were not even there, others were incomplete and some had some wrong information. In the Appendix Data Table, the Barrel Lengths say in inches, yet it clames some guns have 1 inch barrels which is incorrect. Other then that it is ok for a beginner, but not for a person that knows Artillery."
4,Worth Reading,"There is a lot of information in this relatively small book, but I was left with many unanswered questions. There seemed to be too much attention given to obscure British coastal artillery installations, most of which were unique rather than standardized. But if this particular category is the spark that ignited the author's passion, it can be forgiven. I was particularly appreciative of the section on the very heavy U.S. artillery, the 8-inch gun and 240mm howitzer, especially the rare photographs showing emplacement of these behemoths. However the chapter on Soviet artillery seemed incomplete and I had trouble following the narrative in places. The M1942 122mm howitzer appears in several photos, but nowhere in the text, for example. Overall I think its a great start and I would like to see an updated version. Perhaps Hogg's volume on British and American artillery exclusively that came out a few years later is the book that this was intended to be."
2,"Advertised as new, but not so","I purchased a ""new"" book from this seller, and when it arrived, it was in less than perfect condition. Perhaps it was ""new"" from the standpoint that it was not sold to anyone other than myself, however there were tears on the jacket and even though it was published in the 1970s it was not well preserved. I was offered the option of returning it to the seller, which would have meant I had no Christmas gift to give the person who wanted this book, or to get a ""15% discount"" on Paypal which I did not have an existing account with. Therefore, I had no other option than to keep the book sold to me as ""new"" A little disappointing!"
3,A bit disappointed,"The chairs came very quickly but were not packaged well. One chair had significant damage but it was easier for my husband to repair than send it back. They also had some rough or splintered areas on the wood. On an upnote, they look great on my patio and with a cushion, they are comfortable."
3,Not bad for the money,"A teak knock-off that looks pretty good although in a huge downpour it leaked stain from the wood onto my brickwork (which got stained). So, put this chair in the grass. Comfortable and looks sturdy. Time will tell."
2,Learn how to pack a box!,"After reading the other reviews,I still decided to purchase based on price. It is true.Nice product for the money, but be prepared to repair the chair when it arrives. It is very poorly packed and I had to break out the screws and glue to repair mine."
2,Poor workmanship,"The chairs were received in poor condition. The boxes were crushed and torn, which resulted in the chairs being damaged. Some of the hardware had fallen out and most was loose. We sent the chairs back. The return process was easy and the refund included shipping."
3,Steamer chair,"I haven't used these yet as it is winter but I can tell you what I do know. They are very good looking and I like the design, construction and the wood but I did notice a tiny fracture on one of the arms that must have happened in shipping? ( we decided it was not worth returning it as it is small)So this makes me wonder if these are sturdy enough to last very long? They were an excellent price but you know what they say - ""you get what you pay for"" - I'm crossing my fingers - they are nice I have to say."
3,Great chair for the Money,"This chair is of decent quality.... Not great, but pretty solid and well made. It has a few minor imperfections, but for the price of under $100.00, it can't be beat. I have seen comparable chairs for three times the price. Good value."
4,A Bargain,A well made steamer chair. It doesn't have the solid brass hardware of the more expensive teak models but it is sturdy and durable.
4,Great writing resource,"I think this book was finely crafted for a work devoted to so mundane a subject as basic writing. The author managed to dredge up from the morass of academia a few gems of useful instruction, all of which were polished and presented in a well organzied and helpful manner. I would wholeheartedly recommend this particular work to the novice writer. And, as it is the only book I have ever read on the subject, I am compelled to declare it the best I have read. As you can see, my writing skills are ten fold what they were before reading this book - and will likely continue to increase as I revisit this worthy work."
2,needs to be copied in enameled metal for a strong and attractive product.,This style is very attractive and a crowd pleaser but painted wood is a terrible material for the design.
2,$23.80 after shipping,"My first response to these two trays is that I want to return them. They are painted white and then distressed with three black marks on each tray and around the details on the edges. I can see a crafty person using these lightweight trays as the base for a tiling project. There aren't enough big affordable nonplastic trays being made. I've made do with cookie sheets to fit all my meal dishes on but they look awful after being in the dishwasher. I am keeping these trays because the large one exactly fits my teapot, creamer, sugar bowl, honey jar and napkin holder whilst the smaller one fits my large thermal carafe, my smaller coffee carafe and my water jug. But I prefer the larger, melamine petite fleur tray from Villeroy and Boch that exactly fits my simax tea set.Once I fill the trays, the rims look nice from the side."
4,very good video about the Kennedys,"Originally titled ""Kennedys Don't Cry"", this video, narrated by Cliff Robertson (of ""PT-109"" movie fame), is a nice, if uneventful, portrayal of the Kennedy brothers. Some good stock footage included. While not as good as ""American Experience: The Kennedys"", still worth your time.Vince Palamara"
1,Product not as represented,"The welding rod I received was not the item I ordered, based on the item description. I wanted Nickel 99 rod, and received Nickel 55 rod. Not the same thing. I've re-read the item description several times since purchased, and it is still being represented as Nickel 99 rod. The welding rod was returned for full credit, no hassles and the return was processed promptly."
1,L' Oreal,I have been using this product for awhile and I have seen no difference or improvement.So why waste your money?
2,Terrible,This book had no real mystery. The book was boring. It was ok at the end. I am 10 years old and everyone in my book club (11 girls) rated this book poor.
2,Grass Shear,"The product work well, but the problem is the short time of battery, only 30 minutes and need 16 hours to charge."
2,BLACK AND DECKER NORMALLY HAS GREAT PRODUCTS,THIS ONE SOMETHING HAPPENED IN DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING. IT HOLDS VERY LIMITED CHARGE AND REALLY IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR ANY OUTDOOR PROJECT. USED TWICE AND SITTING IN THE YARD SALE BOX.
4,Just what I needed,Works great. Just what I needed to trim grass around other tender plants where a line trimmer would destroy the plants.
4,Black & Decker Grass Shear,"This item is very good if you have a small lawn and want to keep it neatly edged. If you have a large lawn, a string trimmer might be more appropriate, due to the fact that the shear may run out of charge before you are finished, and a string trimmer is a lot faster.The shear is light enough to handle and does not wiggle around when cutting. The switch is a little hard to turn on but is probably engineered that way for safety. The blades cut the grass cleanly, and if they jam from the grass being too thick, they unjam easily. The blades last longer and cut better if you wipe off the grass sap between uses, and oil them lightly, as the manual instructs.For a small area where you might ordinarily use hand clippers, this is a great little tool that saves a lot of time and keeps your hand from getting blistered. For me it was well worth the price--a great tool where hand clippers are not enough, but a string trimmer is overkill."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I can't say that this is the best grass shear made.When fully charged, it will run for about 30-45minutes before the charge is lost. It takes quitea long time to charge this baby up.The quality on the handheld unit it pretty good. Thelong-handle accessory is just fine also. I don't likethe way they both connector together. Seems like it couldbe trouble over time.We have a yard that is close to 3/4 of an acre, with lotsof flower beds, trees, and things to trim around. Honestlythis is not the unit for us, but my wife wanted a rechargeable,and there are not many out there.It works. It gets the job done if you are patient. But therecould be improvements made.To get 5 stars, the battery life should be longer, quickerto recharge, and the connector for the long handle should bemore secure."
3,A female-friendly product,"This product is good for females, as it is light weight, and you have complete control over it at all times not like weed eaters that seem to overpower you. You don't need jeans, army boots and goggles just to use this! I do have trouble with the on/off switch. Hard to keep the unit going at all times. Keeps cutting off. Easy to recharge and a delight to have no gasoline worries or electric cord worries."
5,Black & Decker GS500 Grass Shears,"Good product, works as advertised. After several years of weekly use, the batteries in my first one started to wear out (reduced working time), so I bought another one. That's the best endorsement I can give! Tips: Try to run the batteries completely down before recharging (they're NiCads), and replace the blades once in a while for top performance."
1,Waste of good money,"I agree wholeheartedly with all the other 1 & 2 star reviews. Do NOT understand the 3, 4 & 5 star reviews. Not a female friendly product if there is a lot of clipping to do. You need strong fingers to keep the on/off switch depressed for any length of time. Keeps shutting off after the first sign of weakness in the fingers. They cut the tips of grass fine but to get to the bottom of the blade you have to make at least 3-4 passes. Not for the busy gardener. Cordless is wonderful -- recharges over night. Thot Black and Decker would have a much better product than this thing. Very disappointing. Am going back to American Gardener. Don't buy this OR the long handle, for the same reasons already expressed by some."
2,B&D 3.6v grass shear,"This shear worked OK for about a year. I use it with the extension handle and you do have to have a strong hand to keep both triggers pressed to keep the unit running. Now after a year, a full charge only lasts about 5 minutes. It used to work 15-20 minutes on full charge. I would replace the battery, but there is no replacement available."
3,Batteries,"I have used the clippers for many years and I want to replace the batteries. I have a GS300 clipper not the GS500 and would like to be able to order batteries to replace the ones that no longer will take a charge. How may I order new bateries for the GS300 grass clipper? Thank you, WL Bourgeois"
3,Trimmer inexpensive,"Nice item for the price. Uncomfortable on the hand when working with it, triggers are hard to hold in. Good for small jobs."
3,Quick jobs,This would be great for small jobs. The only fault is the charge only permits approx. 35 mins. use.
3,"Black & Decker ""made in China quality"" cordless grass shears","This unit functions all right. However, the quality, ease of use, and ""fit"" for my hand is definitely NOT the Black and Decker quality I had in my original set which have unfortunately gone missing! This unit is mostly a two-handed operation for me to keep it running. But it does beat the old-fashioned, non-electric model grass clippers I used in the past."
2,Safety is too hard to use,"While this is okay for light quick edging - it cuts through a reasonable thickness of grass & weeds - it is not easy turn on and keep on. The switch must be pushed forward and down with the thumb constantly in order to keep it on. Even in short bursts I still get a sore spot on the end of my thumb (forget about the ache in the knuckle). I have a friend with arthritus who can't even turn it on. My mom has an old one without the thumb safety switch and it is MUCH easier to use.B&D;, if you are reading this...PLEASE find a better switch. I've had mine for about 2 years and the already nasty switch is starting to go now. I have to jiggle it and adjust the pressure to get it to work at all."
2,Loud and weak,"I ordered the grass shears to use around some roses and other areas that a lawn mower can't touch and a weed whacker could damage. The shears are very loud for an electric tool and they will stop cutting when they encounter any sort of thicker grass. It is actually easier and quicker to use a pair of large scissors or small manual shears than use this product. Good idea, but far from perfected yet. Not worth the money."
5,Great Yard Utility Item,Somewhat bulky compared to pass models but does what I want and runs over 20 minutes. I cut dead flowers twigs and do clean up hedge work with them. Saves time and effort. I do not understand negative comments about run time. Runs long enough for my yard work. Use it almost daily.
4,THE BEST GRASS SHEARS,"PRIOR TO THIS PURCHASE, I HAD NEVER OWNED ELECTRIC GRASS SHEARS BUT, AFTER USING THIS GRASS SHEAR, I AM HOOKED! THIS GRASS SHEAR IS EASY TO USE, LIGHT WEIGHT, CUTS EVEN TOUGH WEEDS WITH EASE, NO CORD TO GET IN YOUR WAY, AND MADE BY A TRUSTED BRAND."
4,Light & Agile,"This is not a guys tool; however my wife loves it! It trims extremely well and the battery charge holds every bit of a half hour if not longer. It cuts through almost any type weed or grass with little or no resistance. Ladies, put on your gloves and get a trimming! :-)"
1,Rechargeable Doorstop,"Worthless waste of money. Trimmer jams at the faintest hint of thick grass. Holds a charge long enough to cut about 15 feet of edging, then dies. Won't run when plugged in so doesn't even work as a corded trimmer. I use these to prop open the shed door so I can find the hand trimmers to actually edge my lawn."
4,Get What You Pay For,"I agree with the customers who say you get what you pay for with this item. It is not very good for taller or wet grass, but for keeping shorter grass trimmed I find it works fine. Since this is what I use it for, I do not have to go beyond about 25-30 minutes at a clip (sorry about that), so battery length has not been a problem. If you have a large yard or plan to trim only when the grass gets longer, I would look elsewhere for a heavier duty machine. If you are looking for relatively light duties, this one works fine."
1,Black & Decker Cordless Grass Shear,"""Very Disappointed"" first of all the cord didnt work right and it barely holds a charge and does ""not"" cut very well. I have weeds that I was hoping it would cut they aren't thick but it does ""not"" do the job. I am very unhappy with this product and it is sitting on my shelf. I will just use my clippers and do it manually as this product is not something I would purchase again."
1,Do not buy,"This is the worst piece of gardening tool I've ever bought. You can only trim a 10 inch area before you finger starts cramping up. The safety lock has such a small hold you have to push, in order to pull the trigger, so its not like you can just turn it off and rest your fingers, you have to go through trying to push that little hold and then at the same time pull in this trigger that's so stiff and hard to keep in its ridiculous. Then to change the blade, another horrible design, you have to balance this blade while trying to get the top part on and aligned with these little cheap prongs made out of cheap plastic. I've even written them and the company's customer service sucked. I gave them one star only because they make you put something in , I don't think it even deserved that. There is one made by craftsman that was great and then they quit selling it, now I see one just like it made by American Gardener*****Do Not Buy Black and Decker*****"
4,Black & Decker Cordless shear,A great product at a great price. Excellent for those small places around bushes and trees
4,Yard tools,"A little nervous to purchase used, but they have been fantastic. I can get my weeding done akk in one charge. They arrived within 5 days."
2,Disappointed,"Was impressed with item, seemed well made and durable. However, charged the battery for the required time, and it just held charge for approximately 10 min. Tried it several times and finally gave up and returned item. According to instructions, charge should last for at least 30 min."
2,Almost Useless,"I bought these several years ago to replace an earlier iteration of this item that actually WORKED (you can tell the earlier version, which used to be green, rather than orange). The battery dies on these very quickly so even my tiny front lawn takes two days (one overnight charge) to cut; the old version was good for the entire yard. I really wish I could find some grass clipper version of my electric (corded) hedge clipper, which works a treat."
5,Amazing instrumental sound....amazing voice,"It's really too bad these guys are breaking up. This concert is a masterpiece of sound ensembling from the violins, to the percussions to Betos' voice. Don't buy just one......"
5,Prepare to be impressed....,"Whether or not you are a fan of rock en espanol or La Ley, there is NO question in my mind that one view of this incredible performance would leave any music fan impressed. The range of Beto Cuevas's voice never ceases to amaze me, and to hear him replicate performances equal to or better than those he already laid down in the studio is astounding. I can't say enough good things about this Unplugged, and for it to finally come out in DVD has me asking just one thing: what took so long?? A MUST HAVE for any music collection!"
5,Unbelievable...... Beto's voice is incredible,"This is a must have, whether you're a fan or not. Beto's voice is incredible. This DVD will proove it. You will definitely enjoy every song .... especially ""El Duelo"", duet with Ely Guerra.His voice is incredible, the kind you feel right through your skin. It gets to you. There is no other band to fill his shoes.Believe me you will enjoy this."
5,"An Excellent, professional Massager!","I have used some simple massagers with cheaper prices. Most of them were gifts from my children. However, they were not durable, powerful or reliable. If I use them for several hours, they can be easily heated up and broken plastic parts inside. For this Thumper one, I put it on my chair for my back problem. it worked great. Its weight is a plus. Highly recommended! One thing for the improvement... I guess, it's powerful enough for most people, but not for me. Therefore, I have to use it at the maximum level of vibration."
3,Better Used by a Professional,"I bought the Thumper because my chiro uses it on me and it's heavenly. Unfortunately, my husband doesn't have the Thumper skills that my chiro has. I ended up selling it to my chiro who has 3 and uses them on all his patients. I think it's a wonderful product and works well but you really have to know what you're doing to use it. The video wasn't very helpful and the instructions were mildly helpful. If you buy this be sure to have a dedicated partner who's willing to spend some time learning how to use it."
3,be carefull,"My chiropractor had one of these. And as far as I'm concerned, they should be available to professionals only. Very powerful if used improperly. I ended up slightly sore from use. Returned product without any problem."
2,This is not what I expected,"The ""thumper"" doesn't thump; there is no pressure on deep tissues as claimed. I expected this device to push down into my deep tissues by exerting some type of force because that is what is implied. The only way to get into the deep tissue is to have someone press down on the vibrator or prop yourself up on top of it so that your weight causes pressure.All the ""thumper"" does is vibrate. It makes you itch pretty quickly, but happily you can control the intensity of the vibration.If this was advertised as a vibrator, I'd say it's the best out there. That's the only reason why I gave it a 2.If you're looking for a deep tissue massage that has a slight pounding sensation or an exertion of force as the word ""thump"" implies, you will be totally let down.I'd say this is pretty much false advertising."
5,Best massage!,"This product did not disappoint. Post-operative pain has been reduced considerably, thanks to this little machine.No vibration to the operator, as all of the thumping is transmitted to the person receiving treatment.Highly recommend."
1,WARNING,"If ""what you see is what you get"" aka if you're buying EXACTLY what is in the picture, this is fake. Louis Vuitton does NOT wrap their handles in plastic... I mean, hello, it's LOUIS VUITTON."
1,FAKE,"The only place to get AUTHENTIC Louis Vuitton's online is e-luxury (the LV website even directs you there). Unfortunately there is no way to get around the price. I've found that most on ebay are fake too. If you want a real LV you're going to have to pay. Any other sellers are selling fakes. LV doesn't mess. And you can be sure that once you shell out the cash you will be buying something you will have forever, worth the splurge!"
1,Unattractive Handbags,"This is the kind of handbag I remember seeing as a child in the clutches of elderly ladies, who would also carry little hankerchiefs in church.That is the exact reference my memory recalled as I viewed this tasteless bag.A burlap sack would do just as well as this ""authentic trash"" piece of plastic.In Italy, we inspect the Inside of a Bag before the Outside. Just because it's pricey and has a Designer Name does not mean it Isn't Junk, authentic or not !Please forgive me for my honesty."
3,Make no mistake - Some games do not work in XP,"I made the poor assumption that the bundled EA software would have been modified to be compatable with the newer operating systems. I bought this in a vain hope to relive the glory days of playing Red Alert and the like. Red Alert won't even install under Windows XP. Though I traditionally love EA's games, the support on their site is abismal - so don't try to find any quick remedies for this. If you still run the older Windows operating systems - this is probably a good buy. Good games overall and a budget buy."
1,Too complicated. Replacement filter expensive.,Very complicated to use and replacement filters are expensive!!I would not have bought if I had know the high cost of replacement filters.Plus the Humidifer has another small part that I need to replace.And the water tower is so heavy when it is full ( the water tower is too big).Too expense and too hard to use.
2,base pieces broke and leak after 2 years of purchase,"when we first got it, it worked fine until the base pieces started to chip off. they use cheap plastic for base. because the lips that hold the water tank is so thin, once it's chipped off, water leak is unavoidable. will need to check for warranty otherwise it's throw-away for the whole unit."
3,"Nice machine, just not worth the $$$$$$","..I ended up returning this unit because the reservoir tank is woefully inadequate. It seemed like I was refilling the thing3-4 times/day. I think the problem has to do with the demineralizer cartridge, which is big, taking up a lot of surface area inside the tank. They should really put the cartridge somewhere else or make a much bigger tank. I will say that the unit worked well and is very well constructed. I also liked the fact that you don't need those annoying filters that my other unit uses(Vornado) However, I'll stick with the Vornado with it's filters and it's two huge tanks. Oh, and the warm mist setting is not really that warm at all. It's basically room temp."
2,Not worth the high cost,"I've never written a review for a product before, but I had to warn folks about this one. I own three of these products and they work wonderfully (as advertised) for the first year. But they age very badly - the second year they litterally seem to fall apart (especially the new version with all the electronic sensors). Given the short life span, I'd say you're better off buying a cheaper version and considering it disposable."
2,Not quiet and falling apart.,"This is a nice humidifier feature wise. Also, it is a very good unit while still pretty new. It has a mineral filter to prevent white dust production and it also has a warm mist that prevents moisture from settling on your carpet. Unfortunately, this model ages very fast. After only a month, mine started to make noise. This happens after the unit has been on for a few hours. Also, the metal collar around the ultrasonic transducer is blistering and the transducer itself seems to be corroding. Given these flaws, it's really no better than other much cheaper humidifiers."
1,Excellent or terrible,"Typing on a tablet, so short and sweet.Love it when it works. Quiet, produces nice mist. Own three. Two are replacements for others that stopped working after two seasons. Replacement filters and ionic sticks are about half the cost of a new unit.Third one has just stopped functioning. Air o Swiss says they will not do anything and do not have us on file. After two replacements? Interesting.Five years ago I would have rated a five but now, a one."
4,Good buy,Essentially the same as the 7135 but $30 less expensive. It is also easier to use since there are just two knobs instead of 5 buttons. We use this model in the baby's room.
4,Easy 3,"The Air-O-Swiss AOS7133 ""NEW"" Ultrasonic Antimicrobial Cool/Warm Mist Humidifier possess the three primary elements that I was searching for in a room humidifier. 1) A large tank reservoir that was easy to fill, 2) a visible mist that makes it easy to see if the unit is working properly, and 3) a mold-resistant unit that is easy to maintain. In addition, it has a sensor that detects desired humidity levels and an option of cold or warm mist. An extra bouns is the unit's quiet operation that, while not exactly devoid of sound, produces the kind of ambient, soft noise that helps lull you to sleep."
3,A Lot of White Dust,"This humidifier is fantastic but I cannot get rid of the white dust. Despite the fact I'm replacing the desmineralization cartridge regularly, this humidifier is producing a lot of white dust."
1,Worked great ... for one week,"I was really glad to have found this, even threw away our old humidifier that wasn't so great once I saw how wonderful it was. Then, exactly one week later, it simply quit producing mist. The customer service reps at Air-o-Swiss seemed hellbent on blaming me, making me waste a lot of time on the phone with them performing their stupid ""fixes"" (and, frustratingly, making me repeat the same ones every time I spoke to someone new). Now I get to mail it back to them with my own money (post office lines at holiday time - fun!) and do without until they get around to mailing one back. And no, they have not been apologetic in the least."
1,"Seemingly great, BUT a big hidden problem!!!","I was very happy with this humidifier, quiet, low maintainence, and very effective. The problem started several months later. I found the CD player in the same room broken, and found lots of white dust inside it. The night light bulb was just covered with a thick layer of white dust. I am MOST CONCERNED about my toddler's health breathing air with so much white dust! Please don't buy this product for the health of your family!!"
1,Cool to look at but poor functionality!,"Nice sized unit, great design and quiet--but it soaks the floor. Steam did not seam to really humidify the air in a 650 sq. foot bedroom and it actually made us cough worse. Smells very chemicall and is basically one of the $20 style humidifiers with a fancy name and different outer housing. Buy a warm mist instead."
1,Watch It.,"Defective out of the box. Go for the Germ-Free Mist machine-subtler, better designed, comforting bubbling noise that provides an excellent background for sleeping."
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED!,"I ordered what was pictured--a solid red model, not the racing striped model that I received. I am very unhappy & am returning it."
2,Beautiful but really hurt the toes,Such a beautiful shoe. Very classy but I could hardly walk in them. The lining was so slippery that even barefoot my foot was sliding and they pinched my toes so bad I couldn't walk in them 5 minutes.
2,"Interesting and important, but...","_The Good Body_ touches on an interesting and important subject, even if I am not in the demographic. However, Ensler's text is spare and lacks focus. She tries and succeeds to personalize body image issues, but the only one I feel she deals with is her own. The lack of focus hurts the texts as there is nothing specific to center on as there is in her more well-known work. This text seems more self-indulgent than her other work, and the main thing to recommend the text is its brevity."
1,I didnt receive my purchase,"I never received my purchase. When I tried to contact the seller about this, I never heard anything. I paid for a book I never received and can't get ahold of the seller or I'm being ignored by them."
2,Nothing New,"Delightfully short in length, ""The Good Body"" takes a mere hour to peruse and completely read...which is a blessing. The repetitious cliches used to re-assure women that whatever the body form or shape, the body is good. There is nothing new to enlighten or educate the reader, and nothing one hasn't read or heard beforehand. Regardless of how compelling an argument in favor of an unaltered natural appearance the author puts forth, the bottom line is that in our global community looks and body shape DO still make a difference in a woman's life choices and success. This feminist rhetoric is no different than that which has been preached since the onslaught of ""Feel good about yourself"" books in the 1960's, 70's and 80's."
4,Excellent,"Wow! I had never read Eve Ensler before. This book is a little gem of a look at women and how we view our bodies. The author starts off by saying ""while there is a war in Iraq, I am worried about my tummy"".For women who do not have image issues (all 3 of you) this book will seem silly, but for the rest of us who are oh-so conscious of our bodies and especially their faults, this book will hit home.A series of vignettes from various women, interwoven with Eve Ensler's comments and own views, this book is loaded with insight into how women think.My only negative. It is way too short."
4,Short but to the point,"Most reviews are quite descriptive, so my comment will be as brief as the book is in itself, but do not be fooled: it contains everything you need to know in order to appreciate what you have been blessed with, even if it includes a few extra pounds here and there or the inevitable wrinkles (of life or otherwise). It is okay to take care of our bodies, trying to live as healthily as possible, as long as nothing becomes an obsession, true path to an unbalanced, unhappy life."
3,Good,"Came to me in good shape, and so far, so good. Helpful. But then again, I love Eve Ensler. Not as good as The Vagina Monologues, in my opinion, but still clever and insightful."
3,"Bland, Snickerdoodle, Tastes like flour","I found these to be flavor-free. They tasted like white flour, the snickerdoodle ones I bought had hardly any cinnamon. True disappointment, my kids will not eat them and I bought a whole box. Tastes like sweet, baked flour and water.However the chocolate chip ones are good."
3,"More Peanuts, Please","I usually love Barbara's bakery goods, so ordered these. I found them too sweet and dry. They have a hint of PB flavor, but not enough to please my palate. I'll stick with the oatmeal or chocolate chip."
2,Product Flavor has Changed,"I was totally disappointed with my cookies this time around. Not sure if the ingredients have changed or not. I ordered the double chocolate, peanut butter, and the chocolate chip cookies because I had already tried the chocolate chip flavor and there were excellent. The peanut butter especially does not have much flavor at all. I did not want to go through the trouble of sending the product back, but will probably not order the other flavors again. I will just bake my own cookies and portion them out. Something has changed with the recipe!"
3,Good taste - Bad Price,"These crackers are delicious. They are a bit sweeter than I hoped for, but still, really tasty and crunchy. I try to wait until they get on sale to buy them - they are quite expensive."
2,bring back the butter!!!,"Barbara's animal cookies used to taste good. I think they have tried to make them more ""healthy"" which has resulted in a tasteless, boring cookie."
3,Bit Too Dry,"These don't taste like cardboard, thankfully; they have a pleasant, subtle almost nutty flavor, as if peanut butter is in them. However, the texture, even in the center of the cookie, is not moist at all!! I was hoping the outside would be slightly crunchy while the inside was softer and moist. They also crumble easily. They are alright but nothing I'd purchase again."
4,"Great tasting snack, but way overpriced when not on sale!","I really like the taste of these little cookies, and this is the best flavor (IMO). I got these when they were marked down to $12 and felt like I was paying an OK price. They have gone back up in price, so waiting for it to come back down so that I can buy more."
5,YUMMY!,"Yummy! Enough Said. These little cookies are so good. Perfect amount of sweetness, chocate and crispness. Will definitely be ordering again!"
5,Healthy Snack with NO Saturated Fat!,"This is great for kids AND adults! Made with healthy ingredients and much better than snacking on candy bars! I take mine to the movies, packed lunch, trips, wherever! When I found out I could buy these in bulk from Amazon and SAVE money - I was happy. I will be sure to try the other varieties as well!"
4,crunchy oat-y cookie,We enjoy this cookie at our house. I love that they have this wheat free alternative to animal crackers. I buy this big bag instead of the little bags and place the appropriate amount into baggies as a snack for my little one.
3,Flavor Not What I Was Expecting,"I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack. These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor. Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin. For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying. If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor."
1,dissapointed,"not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money."
4,Crumbly goodness,"Perfect, healthy, world-conscious snack. The cookies can be a bit crumbly, but the taste overrides this fact. I love buying from a company that cares about our world and is environmentally conscious."
4,As good as it gets...,"For the record, I purchased two of these baskets as replacements for a 60 Qt. hamper used by my Roll Out undercounter cabinet manufactured by Tucker Industries. This item is no longer available from Tucker which has gone out of business. Using measurements from the original equipment (which had become brittle and started to crumble) I googled the data online and found this to be the only item with comparable specs. It is not a perfect fit; however, it is functional. Considering the alternative of replacing the whole unit at nearly 4X the cost of a single replacement basket, I opted for buying two baskets and saving half the total replacement cost. This extends the life of my unit for 20 years and hedges against the good possibility that even this replacement wont be around when I need the next one. All in all, I am very pleased."
3,"Not too bad, Not too good","When received this item the box was pretty much 4 pieces of cardboard held together by straps. When I cut one strap the entire ""box"" fell apart. Also upon opening it I noticed that one of the pegs for the lid was broken. I left seller feedback yesterday and the company called me this afternoon. The are sending me a replacement lid free of charge. The hamper works well and it is pretty sturdy. It has enough room to hold a lot of various clothes and it is easy to move around and wipe out after laundry day. I do wish that it was taller more than wider though. Other then the packaging and the broken lid its an alright product. Not the best given its cost me 27.00 dollars plus 8.95 shipping and handling. I really needed a good hamper and this one was okay. Still think you could get the same thing at Walmart or Kmart for cheaper."
4,lo-fi garage pop splendor,"Jed does a fine job on this glorious lo-fi pop album, ""firewalk"" is a standout track by far. If you like the sounds of the aislers set, my teenage stride is up your alley."
5,Boomtown Babies,"It's hard enough to imagine adults surviving the Yukon gold rush days, much less children. But they did, and this little book offers their rare individual stories, vintage photographs and historical memorabilia. It is picture books like this that complement, enhance and bring to life any conventional history class. Readers of all ages will enjoy learning how tough and ingenious children from various gold rush settlements coped with adverse conditions."
4,Definitely a must read!,"Exceptional book based on real life experiences, both good, bad and in between. The author's advice is crisp, practical and stands to be effective for anyone seeking to increase their maketability. If you've ever wondered why you weren't getting interviews or job offers, you should without a doubt, read this book. Well done Mr. Crawford, I hope to never be ""sitting on a curb in Cleveland"".Regards,Craig Flanagan"
5,Time for a review!,"This C++ core language book is so often used that I thought it may deserve a review.I own 3 books about C++ and this one became the reference. Only 200 pages (compared to the 1000 pages of another one :) but every useful feature is well explained. Authors payed careful attention in order to prevent the reader to fall in common traps. Lots of examples, always accompanied with relevant comments.C++ in a core language really answers the questions the beginners have in mind. Concise, pragmatic, the authors are not showing off, they simply remember they were beginners one day and their explanations are exactly what one can expect. Well, I'm so happy about this book (this morning again, I was looking for a reminder about ""virtual"" functions or a detail about the copy constructor and all my worries were answered with no ambiguity at all) I went straight to to Amazon for a review :)"
5,"Clear, concise, and simple.","Previously I had been a strong opponent of C++, mostly because of my lack of understanding of the topic. This book changed my mind completely. It is extremely readable, gives practical reasons to use OO, and shows the corresponding C++ code to follow."
5,Concise and precise,"Just take a look at bookstore shelves flooded by C++ in a day, C++ explained, C++ whatever. If by chance you want to build a solid C++ ground and be prepared to jump into C++ deep waters look for that book on the shelves(it's tiny) take it and get out, before the colorfull C++s in fifty minutes can fool your visual senses. My only ""recommendation"" to the authors/publishers would be to make a second(if they want revised) print, bind it in a plasticified cover and format it to pocket size ..."
3,Cooking Light 2005 (pretty much pictureless cookbook),"Although I really like the Cooking Light magazine, I found that I wasn't as thrilled with the cookbook as I thought I'd be, since there were hardly any photographs. Being a visual person, I like and pretty much need to see the picture of the finished dish before I make it. Now although this magazine has an abundance of recipes, which are probably very good, I'm not sure it will be very useful to me due to the lack of pictures."
4,Cooking Light Annual Recipes 2005,"This composite of the year's recipes is good, as usual. Would like to see included some of the cooking tips that are in the monthly issues, although I recognize that would make the book very large.Good indexing, and recipes are excellent."
3,Cooking Frustrated,"Contrary to the high praise this cookbook gets from most of the reviewers, I find it one of the most frustrating cookbooks I own (and I own a lot). My three stars really reflect the excellent recipes, not the book. They are superb as one would expect if at all familiar with the magazine. The problem is its organization with the added difficulty of a poor and incomplete index. The organization by months of the year is useless if one is looking to plan a meal. When I have halibut, I am not interested in searching for the appropriate month before fiinding the recipe. To top it off, the extremely poor editiing and layout completes the annoyance. I use it, but only occasionally."
1,Something extra with the book,I like the recipes but when I received the cookbook to review the recipes there was an used nail file in the book. It grossed me out. I will never purchase another item from this seller!
2,NOTE: PUMP NO LONGER INCLUDED,"Please note that Amazon is (apparently) now receiving the same bottles as other providers - which does NOT include the pump that SkinMilk used to package this product with.If the pump is important to you (as it seems to have been for a previous reviewer), know that it's no longer included with one and is instead a flip-top/cap.I love this product, however, I am giving it a low rating so that it shows as a contrast & hopefully will be informative for other buyers in advance."
5,Shower in luxury,"I bought the skin milk and body cream several years ago. I've used it sparingly because until now I couldn't find it anywhere. I use only on special ocassions. Recently I had three special events in a row to attend to so of course I used my precious skin milk which has retained it's wonder fragrance as well as its effectiveness. Just using it those three times made my skin smooth as silk. It is far superior to products costing twice as much. I can't say enough about it. Once you try it, you'll get be hooked like me."
4,Great for price,"This is a great product and totally worth it for the affordable price (if you buy it with a free shipping order, even better). It smells really lovely but isn't overpowering. It also lathers well and goes on smooth. My only complaint, was many reviews said it left your skin so incredibly soft, but I found myself still having to apply lotion after showering. This isn't a bust for me, however, since skin types vary so much, I just recommend keeping that in mind while you try it (and you should!)."
3,Not worth the money,"I bought this DVD and paid the $25 for it because I wanted an effective workout. Personally, I don't feel like it was worth the money. The DVD requires all sorts of ""props"" like a step, a ball, a resistance band and a barbell. I'm sorry, but where do you buy a barbell? I looked at major stores like Target, Walmart and could not find one. Also, I thought there would be variations of the exercises without the props but there wasn't so that was disappointing. So I just spent $25 and still have to go out and spend more bucks on the equipment. I'm sure the exercises are effective but I gave it three stars because I feel like there are too many focuses on what props you need to use next instead of actually working out. Just my two sense."
3,A great butt toner!,"Cathe uses every exercise known to tighten those buns!! And, the core workout is also very thorough. I'm in my 60's and have abdominal definition so I know this tape works!"
5,KiKi's View,"I love Cathe's teaching technique. Her DVD's are not for beginners. I have been working out for years and always love to be challlenged. I have tried other DVDs with other instructors and they are just sitting on my shelf collecting dust. I highly recommend Butts and Guts. Make sure you purchase the resistence band if you get this DVD, you'll need it!"
4,good,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level fitness.I have quite a few workouts by this instructor. As always, low key, minimal chatter, good cuing. ""Backup dancers"" are non-annoying although a few too many of them. Good quality DVD, good camera work, music with a beat to follow.Pros: I enjoyed this workout although it seemed like the easiest I have done by this instructor so far. That said, her workouts are usually super tough so this one was still good. Liked the lower body focus.Cons: Lot of equipment used which was not really necessary (did not enhance the workout that much and nearly the same without.) That said, you always have the option not to use all the equipment. I never use the band (dislike the band) or barbell (do not have one) and substitute free weight moves."
5,Cathe's the Best,I own several Cathe Freidrich exercise DVDs. She offers a tough workout that targets specific areas named on the DVD. She's funny and interesting and makes you feel like you're working with a private trainer. I'll be buying more of her DVDs.
2,doesn't work,This is a cute idea but the suction cups are misshapen and don't stick to my son's highchair at all. Very disappointing!
4,Best Cockeyed Ghost yet...,Adam knows how to record an amazing record. It's better than you'd ever hope. Buy it on faith.
3,cats don't like frogs at all!,I liked this book because it was about Dee-Dee and her crabby cat.I liked the part where the cat got stuck on the ferris wheel. The very top!!!! Dee-Dee was very worried about her cat. I would be too. I would recommend this book for ages 5 to 17.
4,Vera Wang By Vera Wang For Men Set,"Very affordable price ~$54 for the set of cologne and aftershave at 3.4oz sizes as it currently retails ~$90-100 and shipping was free! Each bottle sold separately sells ~$55 at dept. stores.Generally, I don't wear cologne or aftershave but after trying a test spray at a dept. store, I was hooked!The scent is very pleasant, outdoor smell with hints of flowers and other scents. The aftershave isn't as powerful as the cologne but smells nice as well. It's not strong as musk but it's just as well as I hate the smell of musk!!Just spray on cologne once or twice and it'll last all day. Don't need to use much as some people do!"
2,Sketchy,"I'm not sure if this was a returned item. The bottles were sloppily packaged and the metal tops to the bottles were covered in scratches. The metal tops are also loose which made me skeptical whether they had been removed in the past and whether the fluids had been replaced with another product... It might have explained why these were so inexpensive. To be honest, I would have returned these if it weren't for the fact that they smelled similarly enough to the cologne my husband had left over from a bottle purchased at Macy's to seem potentially legitimate."
3,Powerful but hard to adjust,Great power that delivers the clean edge you want on your lawn.The changing of the depth is a real pain though.All in all I would recommend this to my friends.
1,Not a Keeper...,"The product description and features sound good, but it is not an especially good value.1. There is not sufficient weight in the base to keep the product from falling over from the weight of the handle.2. The wheels are hollow molded so they are easier to break and hence designed to fail.3. The height adjustor/edge guide is in very close proximity to the blade and not especially secure. If this ever loosened more it would be struck by the blade with might damage the motor.4. The motor is a sealed unit and there is no way to lubricated the motor bearings.5. The advertisement of use for relief cutting aroung base of trees is not exactly a genuine feature. Try cutting a circle in a piece of wood with a hand-held circular saw and you will understand what I mean.I would not buy again. Looks like was designed for use for a season or two tops."
3,Black and Decker Edger,Pretty cheap item but does get the job done probably as well as an expensive edger.
4,Upgraded to B&D Edge Hog Edger,"I purchased the LE750 to replace a B&D; Edger that had finally (after decades) died. I stayed with the Black and Decker because of the reliability of previously owned units and Amazon's price.It took a couple of edging to get used to the new unit. Early on I would go to far into the grass and later I would scrap the edge of the walk. Eventually, I got it. The unit works fine and it has more power than my previous unit. I look forward to many years of service out of the LE750.I have no complaints."
1,Nothing more than a power toy.,"It was total waste of time and money when I found that it was just not better than a electric toy. The blades on this edge cutter will just crush the grass, it wont give a fine cut, thus looking the cutted edge weired. gldly returned to lowes."
1,"Underpowered, flimsy, poorly made, overpriced","This edger probably works find for light work in sandy soils. It does not work if you have an edge that has never been edged before in clay soil with tough sod. Mine overheated and the motor burnt out. The handle is cheap molded plastic that is held on to the metal (amazing there is a metal part on this) shaft by a screw. Not a bolt, not a sturdier arrangement that can be tightened. The handle, powerhead, and shaft all wobble in relation to each other. The housing is cheap plastic. The blade is not sharp and showed considerable abrasion and wear after just a few of minutes of use. This product is like everything else Black and Decker has made in the last decade or so...junk."
4,Bought to replace one I'd used for 5years.,This edger works fine in my small urban yard. I do have to go over some spots a 2nd time to cut our wirey southern grass but I like the quiet operation and simplicity of plug it in and cut. Will buy another when I wear this one out.Rated it 4 out of 5 stars because it doesn't have the cutting power of a gas edger but it certainly is good enough for me.
2,Good but no service centers in the boonies,This has worked great for a year. Smells like something is burning and it stopped working. Call Black and Decker for warranty and was told I have to take it to service center. The closest center is close to 90 miles away. Or I'd could mail it to the service center at my expense. So make sure your willing to drive or sacrifice the warranty.
3,Works ok - But not for me,"I bought this to edge my lawn - I think I should have bought a string trimmer instead. It does edge but I don't think it does that well with my kinda grass and my edges have some stones. You definitely need a soft grass and absolutely no stones.I guess in my case, I just chose the wrong tool."
3,Lawn beautiful,Works good a little heavy for me.I think time will help on just how to use this lawn edger. I was tired of using a weed eater to try and trim my lawn. Practice will make perfect.
1,Good until broken,I bought this edger one year ago and it has worked great until last week. The motor quit working. I bet I have used this edger no more than 15 times in two years. I expect better durability out of a B&D product!
5,B&D EDGER,This edger works great. Very surprised at the power it has for an electric edger. I had a gas one before and this edger works 10x better with no hassle of gettting gas and oil.Only dislike I have is it does not stand upright when you have an electric extension cord attached.
4,edger,"It performed to my expectations and did a neat and clean job. The only thing I would have been happier with is if it would have have angled slightly to make a wedge shape along the sidewalks.It was light weight enough for me to handle and move with ease, and barely slowed down while making thick cuts."
4,Edge Hog,"I used this thing to edge a long driveway and other concrete walkways at a home we just bought. It took a while, but in the end it looked like a pro job. Future edgings should be a snap."
2,Okay Edger for the price,"I purchased this edger in May 2012 and didn't actually take it out of the box until early September. Used it for about an hour on a Saturday, it worked great. On Sunday I continued and the motor kept stopping every few seconds although nothing was blocking the blade. Hitting the trigger 5-6 times would turn it back on. At one point I realized the machine was heating so much that it melted the cable and the negative pin was stuck and it wouldn't unplug. I forced it and the pin broke. I had to go through so much hassle to call amazon and black and decker and finally drove the machine to black and decker service center 27 miles away from my house. They took about 10 days to replace the parts but the machine is still having the same issues. I use it for few minutes, leave it unplugged for another few minutes to cool down, use it again. I guess this is what I should expect for a $70-$80 machine."
1,edger broke down after one useage. had to return it. this is the second Black&Decker item that I have bought in recent times th,"This item broke down after one useage. I purchased a Black & Decker Electric Mower about three years ago and it never worked properly, and had to be returned. Black & Decker is not the quality it once was"
3,Gets the Job Done for Light Work,"Having used this edger for a year, I can say that it is suitable for light work in dry conditions. As soon as the going gets heavy then multiple passes are needed. If the lawn has any moisture at all, then it clogs frequently. The guide is inadequate and care must be taken to ensure the blade remains in the turf and off the concrete. Blade wear hasn't been an issue for me. If you are dead set against gas edgers, try this one."
4,Works Well for Light Edging,"I gave this four stars because it works extremely well for edging on a regular basis. It does not, however, work well on heavy overgrowth.Our house had not been edged for several years when we moved in. I bought this product for several reasons. I like electric as it is cleaner and quieter than gas. It is also lighter and does not need the engine work that all gas powered products need on occasion.When I tried to use it to do the heavily overgrown front sidewalk, I found I had a lot of trouble. It was powerful, and did cut, but was akward and hard to push through the heavy growth. I finally switched back to using a spade, and it went much faster than using the edger.Now I use the edger to maintain what I originally did with the shovel and it works like a charm. It is quick, quiet and reliable. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to do continued edging, but if you are heavily overgrown, use a spade first."
4,Okay for small lawns,"This lightweight edger worked well out of the box, but there is no way to tell on this page that it was built for users much shorter than I am. At 6'5"" it's not very comfortable to work with. I would probably have purchased a more expensive gasoline model if our yard was much larger. It's a push and a shove to get it through grass that has grown out beyond its borders. Work on grass when it's dry. It has an edge guide that's somewhat useless since it doesn't go down very much past the base of the wheels. Once grass is trimmed however, and if you stick with using it weekly, this model will work out sufficiently. If you're going to do a lot of edging I'd advise a heavier gasoline model."
4,Black & Decker Efdge Hog,Black & Decker Edge Hog 2-1/4 HP Electric Landscape Edger #LE750This is a good tool for the home gardener. Powerful enough to do a typical edge along a sidewalk. Not too heavy and easy to handle. Access to change blades is very convenient. Light enough to facilitate being hung on a bicycle hook hanger for storage between uses.
2,uk customers beware,"I think this product is made in either 120v or 220v versions. I did not think to ask and ended up with the 120v version and having to buy a 110v transformer. In design it is very basic and best suited to situations where the grass grows up to a brick or concrete edge, otherwise difficult to produce a straight edge."
3,Black & Decker LE750 Edge Hog,"The handle slants to far to the back, I am tall I have to bendover to edge, it is not comfortable for me to use it. There is no way for the handle to be adjusted. It is only an OK product."
4,The Electric Edger that Works,"The Black & Decker LE750 is a very nice machine. I found it to require a very short learning curve and worked very nicely on our lawn (read the manual). The lawn has lots of concrete to edge around the driveway, front patio and the back patio and pool with lots of curvature and corners. The lawn had a bit of overgrowth over the concrete and that requires a little more attention and care. I recommend it highly."
1,Buy Local,"Edger deceased after twenty moderate yards. Buy local, and better yet, buy with a quick return policy such as Craftsman or Home Depot. It'll save you time and travel, minor grief and heartburn despite any few dollar difference."
3,Edger,I have had difficult getting it lined up. probably not doingsomething correct. I use by edger trimmer and it does afine job of edging.
2,Did not work for us,Our homeowners asso said we had to edge our walks and driveway or get fees. So we traded a birthday gift for this edger. But it did not work...chewed up the ground in fact. Ended up having to pay someone to come and do it with their own edger (that looked like a piece of junk beside this one) but it did the job.I finally found a job (we were both laid off)..so am saving to buy one at WalMart or Lowes where I can return it if it does not work right.
5,Happy customer,"I am very happy with the new Edge Hog. I had use them in the past, but this new model is super excellent.""Amazon Verified Purchase"""
2,Not as Advertised,"Item was advertised as ""NEW"". Shipment arrived in original box that had been cut and opened then taped closed. The edger was dirty and had scratches on it. No papers, warranty, or directions in the box. Edger performed well, but do not believe it is ""NEW."""
1,I DUNNO..........,"I have had this less than 6 months. The blade does not penetrate enough depth to properly cut a decent edge. Perhaps the blade is dulled as others comment in this thread. Currently, I have to go over it 2-3 times waisting my valuable time. I can not recommend this unit. Good Luck if you buy it. Funny thing is the B&D rep who was in the isle at Lowe's gave great assistance and also commented to the fact that blades are available. LOL.............RETURNED FOR CREDIT REFUND. A PIECE OF KRAP."
3,Better edger than a trencher,We bought this mainly for it's bedding trencher feature. Making a defined border around our many garden beds is hard manual work. The trencher feature on the Edge Hog merely cuts an edge rather than a wider cut I wanted for the beds to keep the grass from encroaching.It does work nocely though as an edger.
2,Died after 6 months,"I received this edger as a gift and only used it three times before the motor burned out. It had been doing a nice job on the driveway so I tried doing along the gutter. About the time I finished (maybe 15 minutes total) the motor sputtered and then died. Black and Decker said the motor burned out and would not honor their two year warranty, so I got nothing! Black and Decker is not what it used to be!"
5,lawn edger,I am extremely pleased with my new black & decker LE750 Edge Hog. The weight is well balanced and will edge the lawn almost effortlessly. I have been using the lawn hog mower for a while and thought I would try their edger. Thanks amazon for your care and promotions.Rick
4,Frequent Amazon Buyer,This was a gift for our son. He has told us that it is working great and now it is a lot easier to edge the lawn. Has enough power and likes it. My husband has one and uses it all the time. It works great.
5,A Great Tool,"The Edge Hog does everything your product description promised....and does such a good job! I am very pleased with it, all around."
5,Exceeded my expectations!,"I am amazed how well this little machine can cut through the toughest overgrowth (6"") on my driveway. I had no problem handling it. I was looking at gas edgers, and am so glad I bought this model. Just make sure you buy plenty of electric cord."
4,Good Tool but a bit expensive for what it does.,Good & handy Tool - The price could have been more competive for what it does.
4,Black & Decker Edge Hog,The Edge Hog works great to edge sidewalks. If it is really bad you may have to go over it again in about a week or two the first time. It is a great investment. I would highly recemend it.
3,Great Edger. Poor Trencher,It does a great job at edging making it a quick and easy job. Not sure how they get the picture that they do for trenching but i have yet to get any sor of trench that looks like theirs.
4,B&D Edge Hog Edger,"Plenty of power. Best extension cord retaining system I have used. The edger does a great job where the edge of the sidewalk is vertical. Where the concrete is slightly tilted or curved, it does a reasonable job. The blade is larger diameter than my old B&D edger. That precludes getting a deep cut at corners where sidewalks intersect. All-in-all a good tool."
3,Edger Ok but not great.,"This edger' wide housing makes it difficult to see where to line up the guide to the concrete walk when edging the lawn. It does not hold the guide as well as past products. You must set it on the mid to deepest setting to not keep getting off line.I have owned two previous Black and Decker electric edgers. Each of them were out of commision and not worth fixing after about 25 Months. OF COURSE, THEY WERE WARRANTED FOR 24 MONTHS. AND BLACK AND DECKER HAD NO SYMPATHY IF THEY WENT OUT AN HOUR AFTER 24 MONTHS. Of course this one is likewise a 24 month guaranty."
2,Not Very Useful for Edging,"I bought the Black & Decker LE750 Heavy Duty Edge Hog 2-in-1 Landscape Edger because I thought it would be easier to use than the GH400 Grass Hog. Not so, I tried used the product but went back to the grass hog. Its okay for digging trenches - if thats all you need it for. Unless I'm overlooking the obvious, its of little use to me."
3,It's okay,"Pros: Electric, has power, easy to pushCons: Bulky motor unit, poor edge guide, difficult to cut a straight line, overpriced ($99), one of the worst assembly instruction manuals everBuy a refurb one. $99 is overpriced for brand new. The cut is not as clean as I'd like; almost the same result as my string trimmer. The motor unit seems oversized and the edge guide design is not great, hard to follow the edge of my concrete driveway.Remember folks, TRIM, MOW, EDGE, AND BLOW."
4,Favorable review Black & Decker Edger,This is the 3rd Black & Decker Edger I have owned. This new model is a great improvement over the previous models. It is quiet and more versatile - being able to trench and cut on a bevel.
4,Great Product,"Purchased to replace a weed eater edger that was 15 years old and had gone on to where ever old worn out weed eaters go. Used it today for first time and found it to be superior to the aged weed eater product. Edging was a breeze and was done in half the time as the weed eater. Seems to have more power and the design of the blade chews right through the edges. Whether it will last as long as the product it replaced....who knows, but for now I am very satisfied and highly recomment. By the way assembly was a snap even without reading directions (not reading is a man thing!)"
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this edger to replaced one like it that I used successfully for several years. It was light weight and easy to use with good results. Unfortunately, edgers like this were unavailable in the local market, so I bought one on line, refurbished with a 2 year warranty. After using it ,perhaps twice, the present edger resembled the old edger did...it did not edge. I contacted the shipper who directed me to Black and Decker who referred me to the agent in New Orleans who advised me to bring the edger in for repair. New Orleans is at least 75 miles from my home and it will be a pain in the neck for me to get there. Meanwhile, the grass is growing over the walkways. I am so disappointed."
4,Edges Like Cutting Butter,The Black @ Decker Edger edges effortlessly... it's almost like cutting butter. One neighbor has one and six different neighbors have edged their yards with it. This is a new neighborhood... We are all in the process of purchasing our own!The only reason that I didn't rate it 5 stars is that you have to clean some dirt from the blade surround when finished.
1,Thrashed beyond belief,"This seller shipped me a completely thrashed and damaged edger (we ordered a NEW edger). I am not exaggerating when I say it looked like atruck had run over it! They denied sending me a used/damaged item, did not apologize or offer to resend a new one.I had to argue to get a refund which they did eventually do. It even had grass clippings in it!They should have apologized and sent me a NEW edger. Extremely disappointing.I would never buy anything from this seller, be forewarned."
1,Ninety seconds of performance doesn't cut it!,"Took it out and assembled it in about ten minutes. Unfortunately, it ran for about ninety seconds on the edge of my lawn and stopped, never to restart. Checked the circuit and extension cord, all were sound. The task should have been simple for a rudimentary edger. Had to send it back and finished the job by hand edger, which is what I was trying to avoid when I bought it. I expected something more than what I got and would expect Black & Decker to market a better product than this. Very disappointed."
1,Extremely poor quality!,Purchaes at a local retail store and used approx. a dozen times over the last 2 years. Last time I used it the plastic handle broke off AND the small front wheel broke off (plastic hole elongated). Bottom line...cheap plastic junk! This unit wasn't inexpensive...paid about $80.00. I'm going to spend a couple hundred and but a quality edger.
5,Terrific tool,"I understand that the Edge Hog is not for professional landscapers, it is perfect for the average home owner, and the price is right. Simple to use and the powerful motor does not get stuck. Of course there is the cord to deal with but for the occasional job it is not a problem. I highly recommend the product."
2,Motor won't last,"I bought one of these units many years ago and it lasted a good long time, probably 10 years, and I have quite a bit of sidewalk and driveway to edge. Finally the first unit gave out so I gladly bought a second one. It lasted less than a year before the motor started to wear out. It now has so little power it's useless. I'm shopping for another model now."
4,"easy to use, but gas edgers are better","This edger is quite light so you may have to sometimnes push down on the unit to go edge through thick turf. Mud and dirt also gets stuck easily in between the edging blade and the plastic fender. Besides these problems its very easy to use, and is not as noisy as a gas edger. There is a height adjustment for the trenching level of the blade but that's useless."
5,What a working machine!,"After a few attempts, learned the correct way to work the edger. Does a great job quickly and easily. Also a good bargain."
4,Great product!,"Price was right, very easy to use and makes the yard/sidewalk/driveway area look great! Only 4 of 5 stars because the telescoping handle is at a bit of an awkward angle and is non-adjustable (the angle that is). It's very unforgiving of errors! LOL, just remember to keep the wheels on the concrete, not on the grass and it'll do great!"
3,Nice sound,"This 20 minute instrumental EP has a nice, flowing sound to it. It kind of reminds me of Stereolab or Monade with no vocals and bass clarinet added. Enjoyable music to let your mind float."
1,Do not buy off cameta camera!,"Cameta Camera is managed by morons. They cheated me in a previous sale and when I asked these idiots if these lenses could use filters, I got this dumb response:""Hi,If you'd like to create a customized package or have any questions regarding our products, please feel free to contact us directly. Unfortunately we are not allowed to give you our phone number or direct you to another website due to Amazon policy, so you'll have to just google ""cameta camera"" for our contact information.Kind Regards,Cameta Camera""HEY MORONS I DID NOT ASK YOU TO NAME ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCT, I ASKED IF THEY COULD USE FILTERS AND IF SO WHAT SIZES YOU IDIOTS, IDIOTS, IDIOTS! I hate it when people waste my time. Too bad you didn't want $179 from me but chose to be illogical unhelpful idiots once again."
4,Five stars for Content minus 1 for Amazon!,"This is a great piece of early 70's, non-disco influenced soul music. My only gripe is about Amazon's pricing. $6.99 for a hard copy/shipped and $9.99 to download. Hardly seems fairly priced. Gotta give us a ""Green"" break."
2,A little disappointed,"I like the idea of this being a gentle shimmer, not a glitter - but this shimmer is a little TOO subtle. Even after using quite a lot, it was barely visible, even under the club lights."
3,Orion StarShoot Deep Space Imager,The software has an unfinished feel to it...needs more work. The camera is sensitive but the thermoelectric cooler could use a pilot lite to show it is working.
3,Really over the top,"This latest book by John Morgan Wilson manages to be extremely timely, relevant and although, written with his usual skill, quite unbelievable. Wilson's protagonist, Benjamin Justice, is in the process of writing his memoirs and while delving into his past and searching for information about the priest who sexually abused him as a child, he starts upon a series of catastrophes and mayhem.First, his best friend's fiancé is assassinated; though in the beginning his death is considered an accident. There is a hired assassin and skullduggery and corruption in the highest echelons of the Catholic Church. The story proceeds pell-mell to a quite unbelievable conclusion.As always, Wilson imbues Justice with depth and humanity and compassion and his friends and neighbors are delightful and entertaining. But unfortunately, this foray by Justice is just a little too much over the top. Hopefully, his next adventure will return to some semblance of reality"
4,John Morgan Wilson scores again!,Another first rate thriller from John Morgan Wilson in the Benjamin Justice series......This novel involves intrique with the Catholic Church and was a page turner from start to finish...highly reccomend!
1,Poor print quality,"Okidata laser printer purchase was a mistake. I printed a letter on bond paper, folded the letter to stuff into the envelope and the toner smudged. Second attempt to print on bond paper was also unsuccessful. Attempted to print an envelope. Roller mechanism would not draw in the envelope and an error message was displayed. What a terrible product! I sent back the Okidata laser printer to Amazon for credit. Purchased an HP laser Jet Printer (multifunction print scan copy fax). The HP product is superior!"
5,So fresh and fruity!! I'm ordering them again. :-),"One of my sons has braces, and can't eat nuts anyway, so we ordered this box to introduce him to Aplets & Cotlets (gotta be hard being a kid who can't eat candy for years). Wow! The apple and apricot flavors really come through. I was genuinely surprised. I think these may even rival the nutted variety.It's sort of a funny thing to notice, but even the color is lovely: If you're in the kitchen on a sunny day and bite one in half and hold it up, you'll see what I mean!"
5,what a fun read,"informative and fun to read, this is a loving tribute to the music of Cuba and from whence it came. It's historical without being tedious and a real page turner. I love it and recommend it to anyone who digs this kind of music and culture."
3,Adverage Read with Interesting Facts,"Akers does a great job of placing the information from Abigail's letters into a story, without directly quoting the letters line by line. A story is presented to the reader through the eyes of the First Lady. It was a required text for an American History class, though I did enjoy reading it. The story itself; however, can be deeply depressing while still communicating the accounts of the famous political family. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about the other side of politics."
2,I've read better,"While this was a quick read, Elizabeth Cady Stanton's bio was much, much better and far more interesting."
4,Abigail Adams Is An American Heroine,I think everyone should know about this incredible woman and this biography is a good place to start. Everyone is always talking about (and writing about) the fathers of the country. What about the mothers of the country? Charles Akers does a good job of bringing Abagail alive.
3,Ok producct,Works just like the others of this type but more expensive. lol- better off getting a bucket? true you might save some money. Oh and if you depend on amazon to guide you in medical needs your an idiot. Good product but not worth the hefty price to essentialy cycle water around your toes.
2,disappointed...,"After thoroughly researching and reviewing foot spas, I decided on this one by Dr Scholl's. It is a good size (both my husband and I use it), not too noisy, and we like that it has the option to be used cordless. However, it does not have a heater, so the water gets cold extremely fast. I have used VERY hot water and it is cold in less than 15 minutes. We were also disappointed that the rollers are so small, they are manual and you can barely feel them. If you use the gel pads, it is hard to keep them just right over the holes for the bubbles to come through. So it is an ok spa, but we're going to keep looking for a better one!"
3,Dr. Scholl's Gellin Cord/Cordless Pedicure Foot Spa,"I am disappointed in this product as other reviews made it seem better than it actually is. It is quiet and the carrying handles are convenient. I do not think the ""bubbles"" are anything to talk about. Ability to keep water temperature ""hot"" or ""warm"" is very contingent upon room temperature. I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it to anyone. Probably a better product out there - especially for the price."
2,Not worth it.,We were disappointed with this product. The water gets cold very fast and it's more trouble than it's worth. I would not recommend this product unless you want to soak your feet in lukewarm bubbles.
2,"An expensive, shallow bucket","Go to a local store, get a tupperware bin, and fill it with your own hot water. That will work better than this product, and probably cost you less. The foot spa is so shallow that the water cools off QUICKLY (and you are not supposed to put too-warm of water in) and a good chunk of your feet are exposed. Add to that that the vibration is loud and doesn't really feel good, and there is nothing to recommend this product. I would much rather have a deeper foot bath so the water could cover my whole foot that I didn't have to worry about damaging (making it easier to fill and carry into position)."
5,I love this!,"I love this foot massager! I really like that it can be used without the cord, so I can use it even if no plug-in is nearby. I also like that it keeps the water warm. It's light, easy to clean, and not very noisy. My feet are very happy!"
3,AN ADEQUATE SEQUEL,"The sequel to his novel, A NICE PLACE TO LIVE, Robert C. Sloane's THE VENGEANCE continues the story of the Marinos, who have relocated to Vermont in their desperate attempt to elude the remaining members of a vicious troll family out for blood and vengeance. It's got enough chills and thrills to string you along to the end, but a good portion of the tale appears to stall in the middle, with little or no movement. It's a decent story, just not anywhere near as good as the original tale."
5,Easy to use,"Works great! The 6 inch length is perfect for trimming shrubs, especially the ones that are near the house. For years I was using a regular size hedge trimmer & I would always hit the house when I tried to trim behind the shrubs. I was always on the lookout so as not to get the cord caught in the blades. This one is a pleasure to use, and the size gives you more control. My only complaint is that the charge only lasts for approximately 30 minutes."
4,"good for branches up to 1/8"" thick, not good on grass","It is just not good on grass even though photos on the box show use inthat situation -- doesn't slice but rather chomps through the area andjust will not cut through grass. So, the long handled attachmentaccessory with wheels (for trimming and edging) is not useful. Thelong handled attachment also is not balanced so even though you havemore reach for taller bushes or areas closer to the ground, you haveto torque both wrists to swing the trimmer around.However on shrubbery, it shaves well. Think of how you use a hairtrimmer - that is how it trims bushes and shrubs.It's lightweight and not intimidating as a gas powered model -- mywife can use it without feeling scared."
3,Has Its Uses,"This product is good IMO for very small jobs. I found it didn't cut as well as I had thought it might. I had to keep going over the same places time and time again to get all the growth. I was not cutting large stems -just small boxwood new growth.I love the size and weight of the shrubber. Makes it very easy to use. I just wish it cut better. Also, you need to work fast as the battery wears down in about 20 minutes which isn't a lot of trimming. Very small. light jobs - great. Anything more than that I recommend going up a level."
1,cute but fails to deliver,"I was initially enthused by the compact size of this trimmer, as I have a couple of small bushes that are hard to trim with a standard sized unit. This smaller trimmer, however, neither has the initial power nor the staying power to do the job...at least for me.Fortunately, Amazon.com has a good return policy."
3,sore thumb,"It's nice and conveniennt for keeping your small shrubs in shape, but it will not run unless you have your thumb on the the switch at all times. My thunb got tired after a while."
4,Good for smaller use,"Nice and small and lightweight. Much nicer to carry around than a fullsize corded model. But it's not too powerful. If you're going through thick brush, you have to go very slowly. This would be better for detail or small trimming work only."
3,"Light-duty, green growth cutting only",This shrubber often jammed with even the smallest woody parts of my lavender shrubs. I found hedge shears much better and faster for manicuring in all but the tight spots where shears could not maneuver.
4,NO CORD TRIMMING,I ALWAYS USE CORDLESS PRODUCTS WHEN AVAILABLE. THIS 'SHRUBBER' (I PREFER CALLING IT A TRIMMER) IS HANDY BUT SLIGHTLY AWKWARD TO USE. THE BALANCE IS NOT GREAT WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO MANEUVER AND AT TIMES I NEED TO SWITCH FROM RIGHT-HAND TO LEFT-HAND USE TO DO SO. I RATHER WISH THE PRODUCT HAD JUST ONE INCH GREATER LENGTH - THINK THE EIGHT WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR ME AND SEVEN MIGHT BE IDEAL. I REALIZE THIS SOUNDS PETTY BUT FOR ME IT REALLY ISN'T.
3,Triggers switch to stiff,"The trimmer cuts fine but it has the following negatives: Interlock switch too hard to operate and the trigger switch is too stiff and very tiring on the fingers. The balance also could be improved. I guess I'll have to tie the switcg down while in use or rework the switch spring to make it softer, or maybe I'll get a replacement switch that is softer."
4,Good for the Size,"After having used my parents' 2 foot shrubber, and not knowing much about shrubbers, I purchased this one thinking a rechargeable one would beat their plug-in variety. While the cordlessness is a great feature and the thing has an impressive life, I was surprised by the size of this thing. I guess I should've paid more attention to the 6-inch blade description rather than the rechargeable feature. It works great for small shrubs here and there, but for a 7 foot tall bush in the back yard, it is simply adequate. So just be sure you buy the right sized blade. Otherwise, I highly recommend this."
2,Mixed bag,"We've had this unit for almost a year now. It does do a good job of keeping the humidity at a comfortable level (especially on the high setting). However, I have 3 main issues:-The unit is randomly noisy when the water is released from the tank into the unit's base. It sounds just like the office water cooler (GLUB GLUB GLUB). Because this happens randomly throughout the night, it often disturbs our sleep. You can get used to it a bit, but we couldn't get by without having another fan on making white noise to cover it up. Your milage may vary...-It says it's easy to clean, but I find it a pain. The ionic silver stick doesn't really work that well, and getting all the little nooks of the base cleaned it rather tricky and time consuming.-The tank that you fill up is (as others have said) awkward and messy."
2,Hard to Maintain,"Keeping the tank full, and the water and discs clean, is a major chore. You start to wonder how much it can be cleaning your air, when the water turns green after a couple of days. I don't really buy into the ""silver ion technology"" gimmick. Save yourself some hassle and money, and just a plain old humidifier."
2,limited use,This laminated map has very limited use and I would not recommend it. You are better off with amap of Manhattan.
2,Room For Improvement,"The plot of this book is BEYOND unlikely. Many things just could not have happened and it jerks you out of the story. This author writes OK, but needs better plot development."
3,a bit preachy,"but for some reason, i am keeping it. it does dissect the epistle of james, which, despite martin luther's opinion, is probably the single best epistle in the bible."
5,"Wow, good stopping power and no more brake dust!","I installed these on the front of my 2004 BMW 325i about 1,000 miles ago, and I have to say they work just as well as the OEM pads as far as I can tell. Plus, there is virtually no brake dust with the Axxis pads! For those of you who own a BMW, you know what a big deal this is. BMW OEM brake pads work very well too, but they are a freaking nightmare when it comes to brake dust! Not so with the Axxis pads. Now I just have to replace the rear OEM pads with Axxis and then all four of my wheels will look better!"
2,Not for lone User,"I found this cuff *very* hard to put on and get adjusted by myself. It required another person to make this work. The readings I got, even when another helped me use it, were not any more accurate than my wrist blood pressure monitor (which can be used by one person easily.)"
1,inconsistent,The readings are very inconsistent. After a couple of months I started to get error readings. Now all the readings are error readings. Worthless.
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE PRICE!!!!,"this blood pressure is such a disappointment. I am a retail pharmacist, i used to recommend this machine for patient when they ask for bp monitore. Few month ago i purchased one for my parent, in the beginning, it work pretty well, not as good as the manual machine, but we kept it anyway.. Now this machine is useless, it's reading is a joke, u can get many different reading at one sitting. i would never recommend this machine to any my customers nor friend."
1,Worthless BP monitor,"Upon recommendation from my Dr. to monitor my BP daily, I bought the Homedics BPA-300 thinking that is was one of the best out there. After 2 months the readings all read ERROR (EE). Changing batteries, etc did not help. I am not sure the readings were even correct when I thought it actually was working since the readings were so drastically different each time I took my BP-I have my doubts. I would definately not recommend this BP monitor for anyone who needs an accurate or reliable piece of equipment."
5,HoMedics BPA 300,"We tried another popular manufacturer that has wide distribution at retail. However, their machine was not well calibrated and the systolic measure was usually 20 points higher than my normal. When I received the Homedics, the systolic measuremet was right on the money and was consisently in the normal range on every ensuing test. There is a difference in machines and the HoMedic is the best."
5,Loved it!,"As the title for this review suggests, I loved this novel by SEP. I love all her books, but this one is a favourite. I am not sure that it's any one thing about it which stands out. I think it's a combination of the setting, the likeable characters and the humour. I would certainly recommend to people to read it."
5,Amazing Book!,"This an amazing book that sat on my shelf too long - what a great find!Isabel is a psychologist who finds herself in Tuscany after a terrible financial and career upheaval. Ren is very famous actor who plays the 'evil guy' in all the movies. Isabel and Ren could not be more opposite people but this author take the journey with pure skill. I loved this book!If you enjoy this genre check out; Spirited Away by Cindy Miles , Almost Perfect by Julie Ortolon, Falling for Gracie by Susan and Match me if you can by Susan Elizabeth Phillips (my second favorite book of SEP)."
3,not bad. but nothing memorable..,"of all SEP's books so far, this is her second worst book after the historical one 'just imagine'. the characters are so-so, but doesnt make you feel very attached to them or give you that warm feeling you feel in her other books... dont get me wrong, i'm a huge fan of SEP's, have everyone so far.. but perhaps its because she has already put herself at such a high standard that we come to expect that much from her. still, her worst is still better than some other author's best!"
2,Definitely not her best!,"I am generally a big fan of Susan Elizabeth Phillips. I like her characters and the unlikely relationships that form between them. Therefore, I was very disappointed when I just couldn't get into Breathing Room. I thought it was way too long and filled with boring side stories. I thought Dr. Favor was pompous, judgemental, and a butt-insky. The ending was so over-the-top and seemed to be just stuck in the book where it didn't belong. In real life, there would be no way these two people would have truly fallen in love. I just didn't buy their deep love for a minute. I listened to this book on tape, but if I had actually read it, I know I would have skimmed over a lot of the extra fluff (and there was a lot of it). I hope next time, Ms. Phillips writes a shorter book that has more meat and less fluffy goody-two-shoes filler."
2,BELOW PAR.,I DIDN'T THINK IT COULD GET MUCH WORSE THAN LADY BE GOOD AND DREAM A LITTLE DREAM BUT SHE HAD TO GO AND PROVE ME WRONG. NOT GOOD ENOUGH FROM THIS AUTHOR.
3,Reasonably good read,"I am a big fan of SEP. I look for her books every chance I get. Although I enjoyed this book and the antics of the characters, this is not by any stretch one of her better books. It didn't touch me emotionally as some of her other books have. Somehow something was missing. All in all a good read, because I think it's impossible for SEP to write bad books, but it was not one of the best."
3,~ I Did Not Enjoy The Main characters ~,"I am giving this book 3 1/2 stars. I did not enjoy the two main characters in this s book. They did nothing of me. I did enjoy the others, I liked Tracy and her kids, and I also l liked her husband Larry, every time they went to Ren and Isabel, I couldn't wait to get back to Tracy and Larry, If the story was just about them then I would have give this book 4 stars.Happy Reading Lisa"
5,Mrs. Phillips never disappoints!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is one of the best books I have read. She's done it agian and has written another wonderful book. I couldn't put it down. I couldn't stop laughing or crying. You must read it.
2,Couldn't even finish,"I was so disappointed when I started to read this book, and just couldn't get into it. It just made me hungry...due to the fact that she talks a lot about Italian food, and when I am board I just eat,,and this book was very boring to me. I got 1/2 way through and decided there was nothing it the book for me."
3,Not her best,"Some of SEP's books are spectacular -- Nobody's Baby But Mine, Just Imagine...etc. but in reading this one, I almost felt like I was dragging my feet to finish it. I thought the heroine character was too insecure -- seems she forgave his actions too easily. The secondary characters were more interesting. Iwas disappointed in this one."
2,2 stars in SEP's standard.........,firstly i have to say that this is my leats favourite book of SEP's book ive read so far...... this is not really much of her humopr in this one and its just so and tooo SEP...... it seems to talk more about his ex-wife than him.... their story are not really developed the story was just liek okay.. it doesnt really get me excited or waiting to see whats next...... i have to admit its rather a disappointment.......
3,Hard to Believe,"This story really became a stretch of the imagination. Someone as worldly and outgoing to say nothing for his mischievous behavior as Lorenzo Gage, could never, ever tolerate a stuck up shrink like Isabel. These two characters are worlds apart and no amount of coincidence in the real world could have resulted in the way the story turned out. Isabel would never have been able to turn her whole life around as much as she did to connect with someone as opposite as the bad-boy celebrity, Ren. I too, as other reviewers have mentioned, enjoyed the Tracy, Harry & kids storyline much better than the far out Isabel/Ren affair. The end of the book was really way out there. This was no romantic comedy, it was more like science fiction. I had a hard time just getting to the middle of the book and then the end was a total let-down. This was definitely not one of my favorite SEP novels."
2,Perfect book for snoozing,"I must say that this book was absolutely boring. Finishing this book was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. The characters are boring and predictable. It took me about 3 months to finish this book because I hardly ever picked up except when I was extremely bored. Please, save yourself some time and money and pass on this one."
2,Not her best by far,"Books by SEP are the only books I actually buy. I have all of them and do occasionally reread them. I was disappointed in this book because I feel SEP has so much more to offer her fans than this book. I did read it, but it didn't touch my heart and funny bone like so many of her others."
2,just ok....,"Usually I love SEP books -- Nobody's Baby But Mine, Just Imagine... etc. but I just couldn't get into this one... it felt a bit superficial compared to her others, as I felt I didn't know the characters that well... I was rather disappointed."
5,One of her best from one of the best,"I've been wondering how to review this book without relating to it personally. OK, I just can't. I read this book two weeks after someone I loved very much died. Susan's most current book was full of life -- it had wonderful characters, humor, romance, spirituality and fantastic, intelligent dialogue. It lightened my sad heart.The charmingly flawed, bigger than life yet all too human, funny characters of Isobel and Ren involved me in their Tuscany world. They made me laugh, cry and reflect on marriage. I was bereft when this book ended. My new friends were gone! WAH! Until I immediately reread my favorite chapters. And then reread my other SEP favorites -- Heaven Texas; Kiss an Angel; Nobody's Baby But Mine...I could go on.I would give this particular book 10 stars. SEP is one of my very favorite authors. Breathing Room is the best of her books to date.BUT read ALL of Susan Elizabeth Phillip's books. Your heart will thank you."
3,Mike is great. The album is annoying because of the radio DJ's.,"I am a great fan of Mike Birbiglia, and think that both his 'Dog Years' and 'Two Drink Mike' albums are outstanding. This recording, however, is just extremely annoying to listen to because after each line spoken by Mike, you have to hear extended periods of 2 utterly moronic radio DJ's laughing at everything he says. Their laughter is that same ""morning show"" fake laughter they are taught when training to be DJ's. It's very distracting. The other radio nonsense (sound effects, cheesey music, etc.) just adds to the aggravation."
5,The sims is fun,"If you thought that Hot Date was fun, wait till you play Vacation!You can now build so many things, it is hard to explain. You have to play to find out how fun and exciting this game is. It has over 100 new objects, new wall paper, the whole works. This game is the best out of all the sims!"
4,This doesn't look like the best expansion pack yet,"I wish that they would come out with an expansion pack that features more jobs, and furniture. I am looking forward to vacation coming out but I don't think it looks that great. This expansion pack allows you to go on vacation with your entire family. I don't think that it should be [dollars]just for that. If the new expansion pack had new career tracks, furniture, wallpaper, tile and so on I would be so excited. Oh well. Hopefully they will take my suggestion."
5,Way Cool!!!!!!!,"this game is so cool (i think so) i have played the sims for SOOOOOOOOOOOO long and i cant wait till Vacation is mine. If you are a new buyer or something I really, but i mean really recommend you the sims vacation.Basiclly the sims is THE COOLEST GREATEST GAME IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,EA Needs a Vacation For This One,"The Sims: Vacation expansion pack isn't really drooled over much. This is probably the second expansion pack which enables Sims to leave the neighborhood and go to Vacation Island which is divided into lots based on themes like the woods; and snow and ski resorts.The only positive thing I can think about it is it's a good place for your Sims to runaway to especially if they're in the makings of becoming a star. Unlike Hot Date, here sims (still on the fame-seeking ones)'ll have a chance to mend their relationships and their Fun, while even though this is enabled in downtown, sims couldn't sleep there. But on Vacation Island, sims can spend as many days as they like and contantly refresh themselves before going back to face the music.Apart from that, this expansion pack wouldn't really be missed if it wasn't for The Sims Superstar."
3,a broken man...,"Well, If you can call it a game...there has never been one that reflected my needs so completely. And now a vacation, Hooray!... Until you fall in love. The sims play with you, the same way you play with them, but dont let them get too close. We went to a tropical island, and I admit it was a good time for everybody, but at around three in the morning I realized that it was an abandoned Mr.McHandy that would not be going on vacation with anybody soon. So for that, I will only give the game three stars."
1,Unfair,"I think it is highly unfair that just because i dont live in America that i'm NOT ALOWWED to buy this game at the same time as other sims players, whats wrong Maxis - just because i'm English, is my money not as good as anyone elses. I find it insulting that i cant buy this game at the same time as other people. I have bought every sim game so far; if it weren't for people like me Maxis wouldn't be able to keep making games. After being treated like this i will not buy another."
4,Great Fun,"This game hasn't been released yet so it's kinda hard to write something about this game. However with that being said, I can tell you that I have all the other sim games and I enjoy them immensly especially Hot date. That one is a lot of fun. It's just like real life (only better). It entertains me for several hours. The only downside is that you MUST have the orginial Sims installed to play. (A way for EA to make money).All in all, I have pre ordered this item not by looking at screenshots(although they do look pretty cool), but by my experience with the other sims. I also recommend Sims: Vacation to any one who have the other Sim games.Want more fun? In the summer of 2002 you will be able to play The Sims Online with other people for [money] a month..."
3,Not bad but still the least fun expansion pack so far,"Well, all of the Sims stuff is really cool, so I can't give this TOO bad of a rating. But by far, out of all the expansion packs for The Sims, this is definitely the most boring one. There're only three types of places you can go on vacation: forest, beach, and winter. And some of the animations between those three are the same. For example, the snowball fight option in the winter places is exactly the same animation as the water balloon toss. Not too creative.It was a great idea, but if for some reason you can only afford all the expansion packs minus one, leave this one out. You won't be missing as much as if you left out one of the other ones."
3,Not much bang for your buck,"I'm a Sims addict. I bought House Party, Livin Large, Hot Date, and then Vacation. I was very disappointed with it. I expected more from Maxis. This so far, has been the worst expansion pack. I went on vacation twice and then no longer cared for it. I did like the bear rug and some of the add ons, but it wasnt worth the $$$ I paid for it. (To their credit, Unleashed, is more of what we expect from Maxis. Kudos!)"
1,Just more of the same.,"The only reason to buy this expansion pack is that you need it in order to download many of the great new, fan-made objects you'll want from the multitude of great Fan-made sites for The Sims.Things like, new skins, heads, and objects of all kinds which you cannot download and use in your game without the ""Vacation"" expansion pack.For that reason only, it is a ""must have""."
4,A cool game,The sims Vacation is a lot of fun but the bad thing is that i gets old after a while. if you want a game that you will be playing all the time then get Diablo 2.
5,"Great, But it Takes Up Too Much Space!","I tried this game at my friend's house, and loved it! But now, I'm getting it and found that it takes up a whopping 700 MG! I've uninstalled just about EVERYTHING on the whole computer, but I just can't get enough space freed up!"
3,Worst Expansion Pack,"By rating this expansion only three stars, I am not telling you not to purchase the game beacuse it is a must-have addition to your ""Sims"" collection. As always, over 150 new objects including carnival games, the water slide, and fireplace with mantle are given to you in this expansion. Additionally,as you probably guessed from the title, your little Sim friends are allowed to take a vacation. Aside from the hard-to-manage cost of $500 for most Sim Families, vacationing isn't all that fun. Sure, you can play carnival games and sleep in beds away from home, but nothing amazingly amusing comes along with going on vacation. I must admit, however, that taking time of from work and school with out being penalyzed is a great plus. After Livin Large, House Party, and Hot Date, to skip out on Vacation would be a crime."
3,It's okay...but REALLY slowed down my computer!,"I like a lot of the cool new objects that come with this, but it's almost not worth the 15 minutes it now takes for my game to load. I have more than enough disk space but it is still very slow. I'm looking much more forward to getting Unleashed!"
3,almost as good as the others,"This expansion pack for the Sims is good in the sense that it provides another thing for your Sims to do, go on vacation. The vacationing is not that cool, though, because your Sims get bored of the activities very quickly and it is not as easy to keep them happy as it is in your own house for your sims. There are many things to do, though, and it will take you days of playing to experience them all. With some cool new ideas like buying prizes with tickets, this expansion pack is good, but still not as good as hot date or livin large. At least it is not rediculous like the newest expansion where you get pets. (wow)"
3,Good product just needs more stuff!,"It's a fun product to use for the first few days but then leaves much to be desired. The ""vacations"" are literally all identical and it definitely lacks creativity and imagination on the design part. Unfortunately, I'm bored with it."
4,Good,Great game to pass time I have other sim games so it is fun when there is new things when you add a different one.
4,sims vacation,"It is a nice game. I wanted it for a long time. Everything was excellent. At the installation it was kind of rocky. I thought i could play the vacation CD itself, but you have to play the original Sims and just go on vacation."
3,O.k,I think that the game is a bit borring. You don't get alot of new vacation spots. Out of all of the sim games the sims hot date would be the best. I think that it is funny how they fish. I don't like the lady who cheaks you in and out.
3,A lot of problems!,"I think Maxis may have acted too fast in the release of Superstar. While the game concept is great, it technically has a lot of problems with lock ups and choppy graphics, it also has some issues with compatibility. Maxis should have done some more troubleshooting with this one. They are happy to work through the problems with you but it's a nuisance to have it lock up and crash and constantly wait for assistance. Great concept though."
1,so boring a waste of money,"this new expansion pack is so boring when you get to your vacation spot there is hardly anything fun for your sims to do. There is some games but you have to pay for all them. The new kid-parent interactions are great they kind of make it fun to have kids, kind of. There are no new objests that are must haves they are just the same things with new looks."
5,The Best of the Best!,"Whoever said the Sims couldnt get any better was sooo off the mark!! With the Sims vacation, you can bring entire households from the home, and stay in a great hotel that you built yourself. With 3 new themes, you can build to suit any style. Country, tropical, and western are added to the mix of already great items. Wether you like building the Sim's lives or building their homes, you will enjoy this expansion pack!!"
2,Such a pain..........,"First of all, this game is way too slow! Just like the other people said, it takes about 5 minutes to enter the game. I've never wait THAH long to load a game!Second, this game can easily cursh your computer. Such a pain......And at last, this game doesn't really have many new interesting features. You already know what it has in the advistisment. Only a few new characters, and vacation spot. That make me a bit disappointed.Well, this game may sound fun at first, but I don't really likt it as much as the other expension packs. I rather go to downtown then to vacation......"
3,Not as Good as the First Two Expansion,"I have all the expansion to The Sims, and probably will continue to get them even though I rarely play the game. I feel Sim Vacation was not as good as the first two expansion. I stopped playing it because it took too long to load the vacation spots. I didn't even what to go to different vacation spots because each time you did it took awhile for it to load. It also didn't have many new things as the first two expansions. I don't regret getting the expansion, but I did lose interest quicker with this expansion then with the previous ones."
3,It's ok,I have been with my sims since they came out.At first days slipped into nights and before I knew it daylight again.But with all good things it has to end boy was I wrong.One expansion after another then came Hot Date.Hot Date had nice objects but maxis took out the free will which seperated the sims from all other games.Then came Sims Vacation well I thought this would make up for Hot Date.The free will was there but the lack of objects and food choices for your sims.I can't wait for Sim City 4.
5,The best one yet!,This is the best expansion pack for the sims yet. I mean all the new stuff adults got in hot date the kids can get in vacaction like buy new pj and bathing suits. The best item I love on this expansion pack is the the halfpipe because I am a big extreme sports fan. So I would get this if you any other of the sims games
3,"Good game, but not necessary","As with all sims games, this is a great one, packed with new objects, interactions, and possibilities. It is, however, very similar to hot date. You go to a new area, .. It is so overpriced just to get there and its some [expensive] night[s] after that, your sims spending money goes very fast. There are some new objects, but nothing you really need. The metal detector is fun, but you get approx. a boot or [very little money]for about 2 hours of walking around. I like the carnival games, but the prizes you can get, some of them dont even fit on the soviner rack. I have to just carlessly plop them on the floor when I would rather display them for all to see. With the addition of Unleashed, I find I never use vacation' additives."
2,Terrible,"This game is just like hot date or house party, with a few more items and being able to go on vacation. This game gets so boring. The Sims collection is only good through House Party, then after that it is more boring than watching some movie 400 times over and over in a row. So if you get this game for cheap, you might as well buy it, but after all is gets really boring."
4,nicely done,"yeah, its definitly pretty cool. but the thing is,if u have like,the sims deluxe or something, ur better off just getting from the library or from a friend, because once you download it u dont need the cd"
3,I lost interest fast...,"Sure, this is a good game, in the beginning. It was fun for the first two days or so. Then, you run out of things to do. There aren't many choices giv en with this ""pack"". I wouldn't choose this as any of my favorites."
2,least favorite expansion pack,"I've been playing the sims with every expansion pack as soon as they come out for a very long time. I've enjoyed every single one, for their new interactions, new objects, new places to go, etc, but this really has to be my least favorite. I've found that vacation island is a hassle, although I had no problem with glitches. It didnt come with that many interesting objects, and didnt peak my interest at all. I feel like this expansion pack just takes up space on my computer that I could be using for something more worthwhile."
3,An 8 year old reviewer,"I don't recommend The Sims on Vacation unless you've played the other games.It does have some good points such as new furniture, new clothing styles and relationship scores. However it takes up half your disk drive space and is cumbersome to work.There are multiple freezes which slow the game down.When you give an order it takes a long time for it to be enacted. It is not a very intelligent game and teaches you nothing about the real world.More details must be supplied."
5,The Very Best,"ok, so you think this game is just like the others? Well this is defenitly the best expansiom pack! You can go to the beach, go snowboarding, go camping, (You get to create all of this) and there is a new hot tub where you can cuddle, and ""Play"" You can also basicly ask people out, too! Call them to bring them to old town, or ask them to go on vacation with you! I hope this was helpful to you!"
5,Great Fun For Everyone,Great for teens kids and adults its quick and easy to do it is an awesome way to go on your computer its a blast to make people places and things!!!
3,The Sims Vacation Expansion Pack,"I rated this 3 stars because well, it's not just as good as the other Sims expansion packs. At first, I thought this game would be cool, but I hardly even go on vacation! It's really a waste! I recommend other Sims expansion packs. I have this, Unleashed, and Superstar. I'm not sure if you have a lot it slows down the computer. But 3 is fine. (I guess! It works fine on my computer!) That's why I'm not sure to buy anymore Sims. But I do say Sims is a really cool game! Just not this one, it's really boring! Sims2 is out, my cousin bought it and it was really really really really slow! But I say Sims2 looks cool... But hopefully when any of you buy it, it won't be as slow as my cousin's! Cuz it better not be slow if it's 50 bucks! I hope my review helped! :)?"
1,Its enough,When the first and second sims came out i was excited. But now its been carried too far. I've seen this game and ts very boring. There is no objective in the game and its little guys constantly screaming. I would not suggest to buy the game until it is a little more exciting.
3,Not all that,What can i say about the sims on holiday people say its great when it is not if you like playing with snow balls on holiday get it its for little 9 yr olds i think hot date is da best i have not looked about in sims on holiday but i am taking it back its not as good has i think well its your choice i cant make you get the game
1,HOPE THAT MOST BUGS ARE WORKED OUT-NOT UNLIKE SIMS HOT DATE,"Don't get me wrong-- I LOOOVE the Sims-- I have all four. I didn't give this game a rating because I haven't played it yet. However, with Sims Hot Date, there are too many bugs, and even though Maxis did a recent patch for such problems as Sims not being able to get off a couch after cuddling, some purchase items not being transferred, etc., (I tried downloading the most recent patch for HD, and can't due to problems with their winzip)I hope that most bugs are worked out for this program prior to release date. I think that Maxis is coming out with these additions much too fast and are not really testing enough prior to releasing-- hence, the many problems with the Hot Date program. I will just wait about 8 months to a year before purchasing Vacation-- Maybe they'll have all the bugs worked out by then."
5,"An Older Sims Fan, in my 30's and not ashamed to play!","I tell you, the Sims Vacation has got to be the best expansion pack ever! My mother recommended this game to me, and I have been playing this game a little over a year now. With the Sims Vacation, you can do so many more things. Now the whole family can actually go on vacation together and have lots and lots of fun, and the new interactions make the game a whole lot more interesting to play. I highly recommend this game, especially to older ones who like to play PC video games. Maxis has done it again!"
3,Tired of your days? Have a vacation!,"Bored with your daily activities around the house? Give your character a little rest on vacation and have yourself enjoy the new features in Vacation Expansion Pack.Call a travel agent and get off your house for a camp, skiing in a ski resort, shopping in malls, or go to the beach. Every place has accomodation so you can stay overnight there. Different places have different activities for you to enjoy your vacation. You can do BBQ on a camp site, shopping in malls, 'treasure hunt' on the beach, or make a snowman and play 'ski' on the ski resort.Don't worry about being absent from your work. The time stops while you're on vacation! :D"
3,fun for a little bit,"Sure the vacation is fun, but as all sim add-ons, this one gets a little bit boring after a while. It is kind of fun for a little bit, (like a day or two.) Over all if you are a die-hard sims fan go get it, it features a whole lot of things for your sims. If you are not a sims fan, you should really think about it before you whip out your cash."
5,The Ultimate Vacation,"This game is one of the BEST games that anyone has ever made. If you like to controll people, make them do things that you might not do, you'll love this amazing, spectacular game! It filled my luminescent room with amazing music, and powerful pics, but most of all, it tore my blood-shot eyes away from the EVIL TV. Now, instead of filling my days with the stupid; not fun TV, I am frolicing in my room, with the nonchalant; Sims!I have all the expansion packs, and this is my favorite software ever!-Blinky"
2,Very slow....,"I'm sure this game could be a lot of fun...I am a big fan of the Sims and have all of the other expansions but, wow, does this one run slow! I have a very new computer and the Sims ran just fine until I put this one in. I am usually a very patient person but this was ridiculous! I am tempted to uninstall it just for that reason. To me, it seems pretty much like hot date except you have to spend more money and you can stay longer. If you can get it to run at a decent speed, it might be pretty fun. I don't think I'm the only one that had this problem."
5,Loved it!,"I have all of the Sims games, and I have to tell you, this one is really the best. To get to plan your Sims to go on a family trip is what I would call a ""real"" vacation. Something new for a change with the Sims series, and this is for the whole family to enjoy. So anyone who is having second thoughts about this upgrade, buy it, you'll love it..."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"The idea of taking you sims on the vacation intruiged me and if you are looking at this product the idea probably intrigues you.... WHY SHOULDN'T YOU GET THIS GAME?**-Limited amount of new items-Very slow if you do not have a fast computer--2000 and up would probably be suitable-Vacation is extremely similar to Hot Date. In fact, the only difference being that in Vacation you can spend the night away from your home. It is almost like being able to spend the night downtown--that is like the only added feature--excect the 'vacation' environment is different than Hot Date's--but not by much..**Why Should You Get this Game?***-Good Question... You can now spend the night away from home-They added several new activities--such as volleyball, and snowboarding, although these activities you can only do on ""vacation""So is this game worth its money. It depends. In my opinion, I don't think so.... So from this point on, the decision is up to you! Glad I could help."
5,THIS GAME SHOULD BE THE ONE OUT OF ALL THE EXPANSIONS,"from original sims to livin large to house party to hot date this should be the one for pc games! in hot date you could only take the adult put of the house...but in vacation you can actually send the whole household plus friends to go on a spectacular fun-filled vacation. lots of things can happen your kids can cut your trip short by acting like any bad child would wrecking stuff, you can catch a horrible flu called montzemus or something like that revenge, a pickpocket can steal your money, or you can be heading home early if you did not bring enough money wich most of you probally wont forget, this game should be the most terrific game out of all the expansions..."
1,the sims on the worst vacation/worst expansion pack ever.,"this is a bore fest the parents fight with the kids and there is just no rest for theives in the sim world. they come in many different forms, like burgulars and pickpockets. why taint a vacation with them? JHS the expansions also makes you wonder when they will run out of ideas jefferson"
3,A crashing fun mess,"This expansion pack, like the others before it, has a tendency to have major glitches, including the occasional crash. Althought the pack comes with lots of new objects and a ""vacation"" area, it's still the same old Sims. It's like you're just watching them ""do"" things. It's boring. It would have been a LOT better if EA had come out with some improvements to the game overall, instead of another expansion.People want slanted roofs, and basements and 3rd floors, and children that go thru different age levels.... not a stupid tent or fishing."
4,"Fun, but not ""ALL THAT""","The Sims Vacation Expansion Pack is basically Hot Date 2, only you can take your whole family with you on the vacations. Yeah, it's fun, but it's not all that great. Still, it makes the whole Sims experience more enjoyable, so it isn't a total waste."
2,waiting...,The sims vacation sounded so cool but i checked and it didnt work for my kind of computer so i waited about a year until it finally worked on my kind of computer then i played it and after my 2nd vaction it got boring!! AND once again the sims i want doesnt work on my computer sims unleasheed and sims online dont but i heard they both where really fun so....
4,The Sims Vacation,Hi ... i'm 12 and love the sims i have all of them evry one the only problem with this on is i took me at least and hour to load i have a BRAND NEW hp pavilion mx70 that i just bought an dit is STILL slow.Overall this is the best yet game.
4,The Last One?,"This game looks like the coolest of all the expansions so far, but the question we have to ask ourselves is ""how many more will they inflict upon us?""Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the sims, order this today ... . Getting back to my theme, just how many expansion packs can our poor old computers handle without giving out altogether?(and I know Hot Date has already completely messed up alot of people's systems) But what will be next? ""The Sims go to Work""? Still, this game looks SOOOOOO awesome order it now, I have. You take your Sims to either the beach, Alpine resort, or woods."
3,The Expansion Pack Downfall,"I found this the worst sims expansion pack out of all 4 of them. When I was going to buy it, I thought that finnaly the new expansion pack is here and i'm so lucky! When I sticked it in my CD drive I had alot of fun! Yet after a week it became a little...well, boring. The having the make hotels and resorts took too long, you couldn't save when you invited a guest, and you can't make 2 families stay at the same resort. Yet it was still fun with the new objects, like the volleyball net, the new jacoosee and the carnival games. Yet I still preferred hot date, which is much better. I never stopped playing Hot Date till I got Vacation. Bottom Line : Worth buying, but not worth going crazy."
1,What were they thinkin'?!,"This is NOT the best at all!! It seems the same as just moping around the house all day with your sims!! it says hotel, but it doeasnt really seem like it! i say skip vacation and go staright to Unleashed, Vacation is worth missing"
3,i gave it a three to a four star rating......,"I put 3 stars for the rating but I really think that it's a 3 to 4 star rating because it's neat for a while and it's a good expansion pack, but I feel that they could have, and should have, added more and made more options.The vacation options that you have though are quite fun for a while. You can snowbaord and go to the beach and camp out. It's not really that much to do though.I played it for an hour and then got bored of it. All of the other expansion packs I played for a longer then that and i continue to like them.And now the only things I really use from the vacation pack are the new items. Everything like the vacation stuff I don't use unless a friend comes over and they wanna try it.Good luck with Sims and I know lots of cheats which I wrote in my other review for Sims Unleashed. =)"
3,Disappointed,"This is the first expansion pack that i have bought to go with the deluxe edition. I must say that i was quite disappointed. While on vacation your sim cannot interact with any of the other sims which makes it hard to keep the social bar up.I also found that there were not alot of new items added, there is only so much u can do on the vacation, and nothing that is really all that exciting, they could have been alot more creative with this one.I can play the normal sims for hours on end and not get bored.... after an hour with sims vacation, i had done all there was to do."
1,I didn't like this one at all...,"I agree with ""A gamer"" from Tempe, Arizona. This expansion pack totally messed up The Sims on my computer. It either wouldn't run at all, or it would shut down once I got into it. I spent 30 or 40 dollars on it, so it was pretty much a waste of money. I'm sure it would've been fun if it had worked, and it seems like it worked for most of the reviewers. However, other friends of mine who got this expansion pack said it didn't work for them, either. And for some reason, the other expansion packs do."
1,I'd give this Sim's ep a turkey,I love the Sims but Vacation made the game crash and the characters became stuck on vacation island in one spot. It was if the Vacation Ep was not compatible with the other ep's. Outside of some cool objects it really was not worth it. I uninstalled Vacation and the game now runs fine. I traded Vacation at a local video game store for something else.
3,Good...but not as good as the rest,"I am a die-hard Sims fan, I've wasted I-don't-know-how-many hours on these games, and I have all of the expansions.Vacation is interesting, but as others have noted, there's just not enough NEW stuff in it to really justify the price I paid. The new objects that are there are interesting, I like the half-pipe and the snow slide, but somehow I expected more. Downtown and Vacation areas are so similar, only difference is if the whole family comes along or not. (Especially if you download some of the hacked objects, which I highly recommend...lots of free additions to your game, can't beat THAT price!) I would have given this more stars if it sold for about half the price.Overall...if you're still enthralled by The Sims you'll probably love Vacation. But if you were starting to get bored with Hot Date you won't be missing much if you skip Vacation."
3,Borrow game from friend!,"This game is alot of fun! You will enjoy playing it. Yet, after so many days all the Sims games get so old and boring. You lose intrest too quickly. I suggest saving up to .... for all the expansion's and just wait for a friend to get tired of it and then borrow it from them!"
2,Not the best...,"I realy am going to be honest, this is the worst sims expansion pack. It's really a waste of money because there is no use going to ""vacation island"", when you can throw a party, go to ""Studio Town"", or go to ""Downtown Sim City."" Before you buy this game buy:Sim's Superstar, Sim's House Party, and Sim's Hot Date those are the best Sim's Expansion Packs"
2,Fun!......at first,"The idea of taking your sims on a vacation sounded like a whole lot a fun, and it was....at first. When you take them on vacation it is fun, but when you get back to the neighborhood it is just the same as it always was. The vacation has some fun things to do, but they get boring really fast. In the end I would say that this game is not great."
2,Another one bites the dust,"Mine died yesterday; after 3 years of on and off use the motor sparked, then smoked, then rocked the casing and then died. RIP.No complains while it was alive, it was good what it was designed for, i.e. light gardening work. The blowing power was adequate and it picked and mulched dry garden waste with ease.It was also relatively quiet and easy to operate.I've been told that fixing this unit will be more expensive than bying a new one, so I guess I will be looking for a new one."
2,3rd time's a charm?,"These things are junk. They work great for a year or two and then the motor starts smoking, eventually dying. I have purchased 3 of these things. I'm throwing out the 3rd one today. Yes, they are cheap but at this rate, the landfill is going to be piled high with these things."
2,Will Not Buy Again,"Bought the leaf hog last season and it worked very well for both blowing and vacuuming. I liked the speed of it for vacuuming up piles of leaves. Also the mulching of the leaves saved us a lot of money in leaf bags. The only problem was noise - you must wear ear plugs for sure. Last year, due to the great performance, I would have given this unit a 4 or 5. This year after its second use the motor started smoking. On inspection I found, as others have, that the rear motor bearing had fallen out. A very poor design and a safety hazard! I see on the B&D site that some of thier cordless power drills are being recalled due to a switch causing a fire hazard - it seems to me that this problem is at least as bad."
2,I won't buy this one again!,"I purchased this blower/vacuum last fall. It blew out this spring. I live in a townhouse and even though there are a few trees around my home, it's not exactly what you call a blower-intensive area. The little doohickey to hold the electrical cord extension was not good enough, and everytime I moved, the plug would come out, and start smoking. I guess you could argue that I could have tied the cord in a knot, etc., to secure it to the blower, but I would argue that a feature like this is one of the main features in a blower, and the manufacturer should do it right. It also didn't do a good job vacuuming damp leaves. Everything kept getting stuck. I also forgot it was variable speed because of the way the thing was contructed. By the time that I realized that I could change the speed on the blower, it blew out. Pros are that it's lightweight and easy to handle and it was easy to change from blower to vacuum/mulcher."
3,A word of caution,"I purchased a B&D item like this a few years back. I don't remember the model. But I think what I have to say still applies as I've been in the store and tried out recent models.I'm 5'6"" and no matter how much I adjusted the bag on the vacuum, I was dragging it on the ground. Imagine how my 5'2"" neighbor felt! This thing was and still is designed for a much taller person. So I found myself dragging the bag on the ground, which created a crimp, which made the mulching a problem because the mulch wasn't free to blow into the bag.You have been warned! Try this equipment on first if you're not 5'9"" tall or taller! I suppose the designers decided that only the ""average man"" would use this equipment because it is not designed for a shorter person. I went to the local Home Depot and found that this design flaw still exists in the newer models."
2,Unwieldy/Heavy/Jam Prone and broken,I got two falls out of this leaf-vac before the little male-plastic bar that holds the fan/hand unit into the blowers female part broke as I cleared the 20th jam of the day today and tried to hook the unit back together.Before it broke...it was heavy even empty and bulky to maneuver. It jammed very easy at the narrow hole from the machine to the bag.The bag was always flying off my shoulder no matter how I adjusted the strap.I give it a positive review for the blowing action. It blows grass off the driveway and walkway good. When it wasn't jamming it sucked very dryloose leaves up. It jams on bunches and god forbid there is a little moisture on them.Won't buy a B&D; replacement.
2,Not as Powerful & Lower Quality,"I got it to replace the exact B & D model that died after 4 yrs. The new one isn't the same quality as the old- it lacks power although the ratings are the same as the prior purchase. Maybe B & D changed to a cheaper mfg in China or something. I'd NOT buy again, and probably won't buy anymore B & D outdoor equip as a result. Works ok, but I don't expect it to last long."
1,Fire Hazard,"This seemed a pretty economical way to deal with leaves, however we discovered that on the high setting, the motor drew so much power that its electrical socket melted down. The socket soon caught fire and almost set the bag of leaves ablaze. After a good soaking with water, the whole thing ended up in the garbage can after about 1 month of use."
5,Better than expected,Good buy all around it has great blowing power. It has good attachments. The electric hookup was well thought out.
4,Great buy,"Received item quick, and was amazed how well it worked. Makes my job picking up leaves a lot simpler. The price was great also."
1,Scary!!!,I received this as a gift and had pretty good luck using the blower and the vacuuming modes. Easy to switch between the two BUT the fifth time I used it the plug started smoking and had burned up! This also destroyed my fairly expensive 16 gauge extension cord. The whole experience scared the bejesus out of me. I will not replace this with another B&D product. I did have an easy time returning this to Lowe's. They gave me store credit since I did not have a receipt. Bonus...they replaced my extension cord as well. This is a dangerous product in my opinion.
1,BV4000 Worst Product I ever bought,"I'm not sure about this BV2500 but last fall I purchased Black & Deckers BV4000which is a 14amp version. From the moment I turned it on, the electric motor got hot, was making excessive sparks and was smoking. I just assumed the 14 amp motor was just getting broke in. I only used it twice last fall and put it away for next years leaves.Well this fall, during its second usage, the electric motor completely burned up and became unusable. When I purchase the BV4000, I read thru all its poor reviews and purchased it anyways.... BIG Mistake! Searching this web site, I did't see the BV4000listed, big surprise. I will not purchase another Black & Decker electric product again, questioning the electric motors they use in their products and their quality control practices and policies."
1,I rate it as zero,"The second time I used it the product quit. I called B&D and they replaced it with a new product. I noticed on the one you sent that it was marked 2007, the one B&D sent was marked 2010. I will not buy anything from you that is mechanical."
1,No Power. Unable to suck or blow efficently...,"The motor is weak and can't get the job done unless u pinpoint the nozzle directly over the affected dirt. The Vacuum is not very strong neither and has problems, on my model the bag kept falling off by itself and the plastic tubes weren't sealed correctly."
3,Great product - when it runs,"I've had the Leaf Hog for about a year and ran it for maybe a total of 12 hours. I loved it for those 12 hours - mulching feature works great. However, I recently experienced the motor seizing issue that other reviewers have mentioned. RPMs dropped and then the motor started sparking. I took it to a B&D service center and the guy said that he was well aware of the issue. He gave me a brand new one and stated that a new 2 year warranty would start from that day. Now I have mixed emotions about the product. I feel that B&D is doing the right thing by replacing the product but I don't want to have to get a new one every dang season. Come to think of it - that's really not such a bad deal! In all seriousness, next time I would probably try a different brand."
1,Major Design Flaw,"This product has several design flaws that will render it useless in a short period of time. I used the Leaf Hog less than a year before it was no longer operational. The first flaw is the cheap plastic impeller that wears away quickly when the Leaf Hog is used in vacuum mode. The more significant flaw is the inadequate means the Leaf Hog uses to secure the brass bushing that supports the motor spindle. During use of the Leaf Hog the rear brass bushing that supports the motor spindle falls out, causing the motor to seize. There is no mechanism to hold the brass bushing in place besides a tight fit into the plastic hole of the motor frame. After reinstalling the bushing, it fell out after a short period of use. I recommend against the purchase this product until Black & Decker resolves these problems."
1,Motor Burned Up,I had this product for about 15 months and the motor burned up. I didn't use it a great deal either. I would not recommend this product.
1,Durability is not what this unit is famous for,"To the extent that this piece of molded plastic can be a durable leaf vacuum/blower, it is not. The cheap brass bearing on the motor housing eventually works its way off and with the brushes kitty wumpus on the commutator the unit starts to vibrate and growl like crazy, the sparks fly, and the smell of hot metal permeates the air. After a dozen or so uses, the twist on bag looses its friction fit and falls off the unit. The really cheap zipper on the bag....and the light weight impeller...and so on. The best part of this unit is the 12 inch extension cord.When it works it works really good but it doesn't work very long."
2,Commutator end frame bushing failure,"I'm not that ""enthusiastic"" about picking up leaves from the 6 oaks on my property but I like this product overall. I've received one replacement under warranty already (a complete new one in the box)because BD won't spend an extra dollar to put a roller or ball bearing in the commutator end frame! They use a cheap, unlubricated brass(?)bushing that has worn out AGAIN on the replacement. The tool gets noisey, starts vibrating and exhibits sparks in the casing. I can replace the motor for about $22 but I find this most annoying. I've got other garden equipment that I've used for years without ANY repairs. C'mon B&D, upgrade!"
1,Dont Waste Your Money,Very poor internal design of the motor.Afre two years of moverate use a brass bushing on the back of the motor worked itself loose. There is NOTHING other than friction keeping the bearing in place.I replaced the bearing on two different occasions and now it wont stay on at all. A VERY poor design...which shows that B&D; dosent care about the product. This wasnt just a simple malfunction or damage. It is a desighn flaw.As others have mentioned the impellers get chewed up quickly if you vacume up anything more dense than a twig.
5,Very good product.,"Since the leaves are now beginning to fall in the Pacific Northwest, I've had a few opportunities to use this blower in vacuum mode, both on dry and on wet leaves. Our yard abuts a few big leaf maples (aptly name -- 12-14 inch leaves!). I've found that the best approach is to first rake the leaves in a number of large piles, and then use the B&D to vacuum them up. It has had absolutely no problems, even with large, wet leaves. It's jammed maybe three times total, and it's very easy to unjam. I've had tons of mulch, wood chips, etc., go through the unit, and when I inspect it, it's no worse for the wear -- even the impeller looks good. The unit is a bit clumsy with the power cord to haul all over the lawn looking for leaves to vacuum, and that's why instead I do a bit of pre-raking first. Overall, this is a solid product."
2,price is good but quality is not the greatest,I bought this and spent the weekend with it. I almost returned it after I opened the box and looked at the overall manufacturing quality. I almost returned it after using it for an hour or 2. The blower function works good (that's why I gave 2 stars); the vacuum function does not work so well. The thing is quite loud too. I would be surprised if this lasts a year with occasional use. Heads Up B&D and other American manufacturers - consumers would be willing to pay a bit more for better product quality and durability.
1,Design flaw confirmation,"I must attest to the customer who experienced the brass bushing design flaw. Once this bushing fell out, the motor seized and even re-installing could not wake this hog up. I did not use my blower for more than 8 hours total of just blowing. I had the unit for over a year."
2,Not for Desert Yards,"We bought this product right after moving to Arizona, before we knew how tough desert landscaping is. Out here, landscaping is rocks and colored gravel in lieu of grass, so a yard blower needs infinite power variation for strong airflow to get yard debris off boulders and stones, but light airflow not to spray gravel all over. Though this product has plenty of blower power, its blower speed variation is not enough to accomplish this. A bigger problem is the plastic impeller, which is too soft to withstand the universally sharp and sere plant debris from bougainvillea, citrus, palms, pines, pods, oleanders, etc., that are vacuumed; and pea gravel, which is everywhere and unavoidably gets into the vacuum, tears the blades even worse. The result is that after the second year the product would barely mulch or have suction because the blades were so chewed. Back home this product would probably be OK, but desert landscaping requires metal blades and an infinitely variable blower."
2,DISLIKE,Purchased this last week and used it for the first time yesterday. Seems very underpowered to me. Tried adjusting the air speed to the max and still had to almost push a small stone with the tip of the blower to get it to move. Seems like you have to be on top of the leaves to get them to move. Maybe I will try it again and have better results. I really miss my old Toro that was over 10 years old before it died. That thing was great.
5,Lasted 10 Years.....,"I purchased my B & D Leaf Blower BV2500 in 2001. It lasted 10 years with no breakdowns or repairs. I used it mostly for leaf pickup which means it got heavy use in the fall and springs seasons filling 20-25 bags per year. Finally, in the fall of 2011 the switch started to act up, the pins holding the bag in place wore down, and the bag started to tear. I retired this unit to the ""Leaf Bagger Hall of Fame"" as it served me well for 10 years. I will be purchasing the exact model again this spring."
4,Great blower/vac within its design parameters,"I have owned this unit for over 3 years. It is a superior blower and the vac works really well and mulches the leaves as advertised. Caveat: If you have oak trees with acorns, the vac is powerful enough to suck them up, and create mayhem with the housing (shattering mine and actually creating a semi-dangerous situation - make certain you wear eye protection when you use this item). That said, I love this unit and am going to purchase a replacement vac housing and impeller blade (mine is worn to a nub from said acorns). If you deal exclusively with grass/leaves and don't have much hard debris (mulch, stones, acorns), this unit should be perfect for you. Ergonomics are very good, very easy to use. I don't understand the cord handling comments/issues some have"
1,poor quality,They are good for two uses tops. My first one burt up a motor in 15 minutes. The second made it to the second chore before the motor burnt up again.
4,"Great blower, decent vacuumer","This product works great as a blower. It saves me a lot of time because I no longer sweep up grass clippings, and it does a much better job than a sweeper. I've also used it to clean out dirt that's blown into my garage. It's very easy to switch from blower to vacuum mode. The vacuum works decently, but you have to put the nozzle directly above what you want to pick up. I was hoping it would pull grass clippings and leaves from a larger area around the nozzle. I haven't tried picking up a large amount of leaves, so I'm not sure how well the mulcher works. Overall a great product though."
2,This blower sucks,"I had mine for 2 years - probably a total of 18 hours of operation - and the thing burnt itself to a crisp. The motor caught on fire last week, about 2 hours shy of finishing the fall yard clean-up. For the past ~ 8 hours of operation, the motor was getting louder & shaking more & more. Finally sparks and flames came out the side, signaling the end. I unplugged it and watched it smoke.Even when it was new it would jam up w/ mulched leaves every 5 - 10 minutes in vacuum mode, and when you switched it from suck to blow, it didn't have enough oomph to push a large pile of leaves.Although it was cheap (I think I paid $85 @ Lowes), I'm not going to buy another one. I'd rather spend a little more on something that will hopefully last longer, and won't leave a black scar on my sidewalk."
2,"Good Blower, but died in less than a year","I bought the Leaf Hog in May 03 and used it for one season of moderate use. The blower worked well but the vacuum had problems. It only worked well with dry leaves, and then only until the bag was about half full. The impeller also wears away very quickly. In April 04, during a Spring cleanup the engine emitted a burning smell and the unit died. I took it to a service center and after a couple of weeks they replaced the unit with a new one (which now includes the attachment that connects to a garbage can). I suspect that the new unit will not last much longer than the first. I cannot recommend a product with a life span of one year of moderate use."
1,3-in-1? Two out of three functions work poorly,"Overall - poor vacuum/mulcher design. If you want to use it as a blower only, then give it 5 stars. I only used this unit for half an hour before I realized that I made a mistake for buying it. On the box it specifically says that it can handle small twigs and pine cones. Well, a small twig smaller than the size of a drinking straw got caught in the nozzle, while rubbing against the *plastic* chopping blade. The friction caused the plastic blade to melt, and the twig started smoking. When I stopped the unit and opened it up, I found a groove cut into the chopping blade. Let's say that the little twig won this battle. The unit's performance was significantly reduced at this point. They should have used a more durable metallic chopper. Also the pine cones were not getting chopped, but were simply bouncing off the chopper blade endlessly, further wearing it down."
1,poor quality,"This is the second B&D blower vac that I have owned. The first was used both as a blower and vac. The motor burned up after 4 seasons. I bought replacement brushes and a switch that failed(B&D refused to replace the motor). I foolishly bought another B&D blower vac (on impulse,since I needed one right away and it was the only one available at the time at my local home center) that has lasted short of two seasons only as a blower. The bearings seized. Poor quality throughout. Poor balance for holding the tool."
2,This Hog Blows,"My resent birthday gift (Leaf Hog,BV2500) is a total dissapointment. It doesn't blow the leaves very far and as far as the vac mode is concerned, you might as well use your house vac instead. I do not recommend this product."
2,Watch the vacuum bag blow off! Wear goggles!,"I have had a BV2500 for two years If the vacuum bag gets over 1/4 full or the clip type lever gets a little loose watch it the bag blows off and all the chopped up leaves and dust blows right in your face. I complained to B&D and they sent me a new bag. Right away the new bag blew off. They sent me a new improved bag,(it has a black latch instead of orange.) It lasted a little while then poof! it went too. I resorted to modifying the bag with two bolted on ""c"" clamps screwed on and it works fairly well except it is no longer easy to empty. Also the high speed part of the switch is tempermental and only works 50% of the time."
4,Does What it Say's,"I just purchased the B&D Leaf Hog. I have a pretty big yard with lots of trees. I raked the front yard and had three very large piles of leaves, I used the Vac and it picked up the leaves/pine combs/ and those round balls with ease. The mulching works well. I then blew the leaves/muck from my gutters. The Leaf Hog was a blast to use, It sure beat sweeeeppping, then picking up the leaves by hand/shovel.I recommend it ."
1,Skip this Product,"I have a puny yard and only use the vacuum/mulcher to suck up leaves and grass clippings which seem to get everywhere. After about half a dozen uses, it got a hole in the bag. B&D; documentation includes this whole pitch about how they care about quality and to contact them. They don't. I got the run-around. The replacement bags cost almost half as much as the Leaf Hog. That's where they make the money. I never even got a chance to wear out the plastic impeller that others complain about. Very dissatisfied.Update: Foolish me now on my 2nd Leaf Hog. I would now give this product 0 stars if possible. After less than probably 1 or 2 trash cans of leaves, the motor began to vibrate wildly, and subsequently come apart. I now have various motor parts loose inside the body.I've had similar bad experiences with other B&D; products. I'm beginning to think that they are just not intended to be used. The next blower/vac I get will be the Toro."
1,malfunctioned 2 times,"I ordered this blower by black/decker, started it for first time-burnt out after few minutes. Returned and got a replacement of same item-same problem again. Bought a toro from home depot and is working fine."
1,Burned up in my hands after 3 uses.,"Well, I thought I received a good deal. But on my third use it literally burned up as I was useing it. Im bummed."
3,b&d leaf/vac,"The Black and Decker Model BV2500 Leaf/Vacuum was purchased to replace a similar B & D product which was accumulating a fair amount of wear. The old model had much to recommend it such as excellent performance and easily obtainable and easily replaceable brushes. B & D apparently changed motor suppliers several years ago; the motor of the new model is not as easily serviced. Nevertheless, the performance of the new model compares favorably with the old. Unfortunately, it suffered from excessive brush arcing. The tool was taken to the local authorized B & D service center, where the offending motor was replaced. The brush arcing is now at a more acceptable level, and the work was completely covered by the warranty."
4,No problems here,"I'm in my 3rd season of heavy use for this machine. My house is surrounded by big oak and maple trees and I use this machine (for the vacuum) for a good 3 or 4 weekends straight each spring and fall. My bag recently tore, but I don't necessarily blame that on poor construction. I do wish there was a better cord lock to keep the cord from coming unplugged, but overall I like it very much. Previously I had a Toro blower vac that was variable speed, but overall less powerful and it clogged much more easily. I find the leaf hog very hard to clog- it works very well."
3,Not there for the long haul,"I am not the person with the best lawn on the block. I just like to keep mine looking clean. I have weeds, but not from lack of trying. I just don't have the time to devote myself to the yard.I'm not sure what I expected, but I didn't expect my blower to malfunction so soon. I used mine for one full season before my on/off switch died. I have no problem turning it ""off"" and then unplugging it, but that isn't what it should do.Switch aside, it works wonderfully blowing all our leaves (not wet ones) and it mulches well. For the quantity of leaves we get (7 trees plus woods behind the house with a fenced backyard) a bigger bag would be very useful. I also use it to ""sweep"" the garage."
2,"The good, the bad, and the ugly","I've used the BV2500 for 1 year.The Good: Not too heavy; I find it easy to switch between the blower and vacuum; after a few uses (to loosen up the connection), the bag was easy to attach and detach; good variable speeds for all blower needs.The bad: After 1 year the on-off switch stopped working. I now control on/off with the plug. Also, the wire attachment doesn't work for me - I tie the cords together to secure the connection.The ugly: A big piece of duct tape holding the tube extension of the blower after it loosened and fell off.I understand B&D; is coming out with a ""new and improved"" product."
1,LOUD and SLOW,"Have a lawn with several 40yr old Maples, 130yr old Pecans, 150yr old Post Oaks. Also have 100 ft. of 40 yr old Red Tip Shrubs Leaves and small branches are a constant battle. Hoped to find a system which would help me save time trying to handle the leaves. This thing seemed cheaply made and was so noisy that my ears ached for three hours after only running the equipment for twenty minutes. It kicked up more soil than leaves and while I used the special direct to trash can feeder and purchased a trash can with wheels, it was still extremely awkward and inefficient. ... This was more trouble than help."
1,works well but doesn't work long .........,"I bought this for myself for quick porch and yard cleanups between professional landscaper maintenance visits, so it was only used about 8 - 10 times for less than a half hour each time for the period from 2002 to Fall 2005. It just up and died on its second time out in the Fall of 2005.that seems to be my history with Black and Decker products."
1,Junk save your money,"Had it 2 years, only used the blower function, light duty. Year one, on off switch malfunctioned. Year 2 on off switch totally quits.Had a Brush hog string trimmer it also lasted 2 years. From now on I think I'll just avoid the B&D brand altogether. They used to make a good product in the 60's and and 70's, but the last 2 items I got from them are a total waste of good money.SAVE YOUR MONEY DON""T BUY IT! JUNK JUNK JUNK"
3,Great and powerful tool.. the bag is another story,"Love the black and decker blower/vac/mulcher. Powerful tool.. Did have a problem, the bag busted the first time i used itBlack & Decker BV2500 12 amp Electric Blower/Vacuum/Mulcher"
2,Ease of using,After using a bv1000 for about 15 years I was disappointed with this one. It is very unbalanced and hard to use for a blower with one hand. I would return it if I didn't have to pay shipping of $16 plus. The change from blower to vac is nice though.In this world if you like a product it might be best to buy a second one because it seldom is an improvement when changes are made.
2,Cumbersome bag flies off easily,"This product is heavy, cumbersome, and each time I used it as a vaccum, the bag seperated from the unit. It is difficult to carry the bag while it is inflated by the blower. The suction is very powerful lifting 2-3""rocks as well as leaves so you need to adjust how low you can use it. Using the blower causes a debris shower that is difficult to control. Better have your steel toe shoes, unbreakable visor, and liability insurance paid up before using this. I bought it because I cannot bend anymore, this unit is way too unyeildly to use well."
4,Better than raking and bagging,Using the B&D blower to pile up the leaves and the mulcher unit to mulch them speeds up the awful job of removing the leaves from my yard every year. I have an older unit from B&D that is at least five years old and still working. My wife uses the new blower unit to collect the leaves and I mulch them with the older unit.
2,"Not very durable, and died in two years","This is the second such product I have owned. The first allowed you to change from blower to vac with the flick of a lever, this one...you have to stop everything, and change out half the machine.Pro: Price, one of the cheaper units out there which is what attracted me.Cons: You get what you pay for. Plastic impeller was chewed alive by things I picked up in my yard (the stray pebble in the grass for instance)I only used this in the fall (duh) and it lasted two years with an average of probably 10 hours a year. If you do the math, that's about 20 hours of running, and I do think I'm overestimating somewhat. The motor fried out last fall.I'm going to purchse the Toro next, which has the highest user rating. I hope you all know what you're talking about, because I don't want to keep buying these."
2,Easy to use...until it starts smoking,"I got this blower last week and, the first time out vacuuming, the engine began to smoke before shutting down completely after less than five minutes of use.I'm returning this one to Amazon immediately and crossing my fingers that the replacement will be less explosive."
4,A Useful Book for Nation Wide Internships,"This is definitely a very useful book especially for college students looking for summer internships. It is very comprehensive, but many of the internships are very competitive and if they are in the book thousands of other people are reading about them too. Still, the book has opportunities across the country as well as some internationally. I would definitely use it as one of several resources in an internship search and it is a very good starting place."
2,Unsatisfied,I was expecting more than the simple decorating ideas this book has offered but I found nothing new in the author's ideas. I am totally disappointed! This book is also overpriced! May be the pictures and the paper made up for the price but the content are not as inspirational as I expected. I gave it a 2 stars because I appreciate the author's confidence in publishing a mediocre decorating book.
1,Uninspirational.,"The information contained in this book does not justify the price. With all due respect to the author, these cookie ideas are better suited in pamphlet form given at craft or cake decorating stores. I'm sure the author is qualified. However, with all the competition in the market, I'm afraid this book falls short.I highly recommend Collette Peters Christmas book which contains breathtaking works of art in both the form of cakes and cookies that the average person can make. If your focus is cookies, Toba Garrett's ""Creative Cookies"" is the ultimate cookie treasure book!"
2,"Beautiful pictures, but terrible recipes","Joanna Farrow's book ""Decorating Cookies"" is full of wonderful ideas and holiday suggestions, but beware of her butter cookie recipe which produced the worst tasting cookies I have ever made! They were flaky, and had a cardboard-like consistency. Stick to ""The Joy of Cooking"" (which has never failed me) for great cookie ideas."
2,Mediocre,"After reading ""Creative Cookies"" by Toba Garrett, this book was nothing spectacular. I even paid more for this book. Sorry!"
3,Decorating Cookies,"This was an ok book, however, I was looking for something a little more sophisticated. The ideas were more for everyday cookies or for a child's birthday party or school function. I have not tried any recipes. There was no excitement in this cookie decorating book for me. Sorry."
3,Did she say 4/5 cup??,"The pictures are lovely, but I'd be afraid to try the cookie dough recipes - one calls for 4/5 cup of confectioners'sugar. I could do the math to translate this into tablespoons, but I'm more inclined to think there is a typographical error somewhere or a problem in translating all the ingredient amounts into American measurements. Similarly, every recipe uses ""an egg,"" rather than a small, medium, large or extra large egg."
5,Decorating Cookies,The recipes were easy to follow. The pictures are great. The book gives a lot of different variety of decorated cookies.
3,Not All That Great Really,"Should have went with those other books, ive bought and readRagnar Benson's Bookon hiding stuff, andHow To Bury Your Goods. If you really wanna know how to hide stuff from anyone pick up those books.Reasons i bought this book from Paladin Press is because i needed to order something to keep my catalogs from them coming, we just had our house remodeled and added on to and my wifes been thinking about this topic so she wanted some additional info to read. Sometime here im gonna go buy those other two books and see if there isnt more to learn, you might want to start there also and pass on this book.Its a good thing Amazon doesnt sell this book!"
5,"Go, Pastor Hez!","A well-timed and well-written book from one of the best gospel singers out there! Lots of biblically sound teaching to go along with heartfelt personal stories and anecdotes. If you're looking for some direction in life, or if you just need to hear some encouraging words, this is the book for you. Preach it, Pastor Hez!"
5,Perfect,Is perfect just fit normal on the lens don't need anything for it I recommend it to whoever have this lens
3,Expensive Piece of Plastic that Doesn't Stay On,"If this was reasonably priced, it would get 4 stars. I actually like the hood design on the 24-70 with the reverse zoom. Lens is longest at its widest zoom point so it uses the least amount of hood for flare. Pretty ingenious for the time they designed this lens.But the price is simply crazy and that takes a star off.Also, this is the hood that falls off the lens the most of all lenses I have. It's almost like I am living with stripped threads. I have already lost one of these hoods and have had to walk my way through a packed venue in order to retrieve it multiple times. - 1 star for that"
1,crap didn't even work!!!,"omg!!! a total waste of money!!! i received d game and it didn't even work in my PS2,damn disc was FAKE!!! AND I BOUGHT IT RIGHT HERE!!!"
3,they did what they could xD,its really boring but maybe playing it with a friend can make it entertained for a few hrs. the price is fine so adding up more to yer pile of games it will make it good.
5,Great Product,"I recommend this product to anyone who lives in the cold weather states, this help keep your engine warm and reduces cold starts in the winter."
5,Ambitions,What a wonderful story and believable. I so enjoy this novel and so went on to read every book from this author that I could lay my hands on.The Juniper Bush was the 2nd I read. Also a must read
2,It says it's the right size for 91' nissan nx but lied,Don't buy it. It's going to make you waste your money on junk that's not compatible with the vehicle. This thing sucks....
3,Doesn't really work on a Kindle,"I bought the Kindle version of this book because it was cheap and it received a lot of rave reviews. Unfortunately the Kindle version is only useful for somebody who is proficient in middle English. I haven't seen the paper edition, but the book states that difficult words are translated as footnotes on the same page they appear. No doubt this is makes for a great reading experience as you can enjoy Chaucer's original text and use the footnotes on the same page to pick up what you can't understand. Sadly this doesn't work on a Kindle as you have to continually page back and forth between the translations (maybe 5 or 6 times per page)."
1,Beware the Kindle version!,"The Kindle version is a Wonder bread modern English version and not a copy of the expected Penguin Middle English version. The reviews for the Kindle version are non-applicable carryovers from the Penguin Classics version. Thank goodness the Kindle version is only 99 cents, so not too much loss."
4,Good Middle English version of The Canterbury Tales,"This edition is good for anyone looking to read the Canterbury Tales in the original Middle English. The notes are very details and helpful and the glosses at the bottom of the pages are helpful too. Some of the glosses are a little obvious, but that it to be expected.Over all this is a good edition if you are interested in reading a very popular work in it's original language."
3,Pilgrimage Tales,"As a reader of Middle English tales in the original spelling and structure, I found this edition to be a good publication. It makes for good adventure and humor and suspense. I enjoy reading Chaucer in front of my fireplace on snowy winter nights."
2,ok,"The book was in okay condition. Lots of writing in the book, still the body was not torn or battered."
3,Wrong CDs delivered,It was disappointing to see the songs on the three CDs in the delivered shipment did not exactly match the songs listed in the product description. Several songs were missing because an entire CD was different than advertised.
1,How NOT to film and edit a rock band,"The music is great, I love Cream. With a great band like this I would hope to see the band play together, the interaction between players is part of what makes a classic band so fascinating. The camera never gets past the head shot and mostly focuses on teeth. The filming is so inconsistent with the music that it is an agony to watch. Wouldn't you like to watch Eric Clapton play his guitar? So would I. Don't expect to on this one. The only solo shot of him is filmed from behind. Like to watch Ginger Baker play a set of drums? Don't expect to see more than him grimace with an occasional corner of a cymbal vibrate by. Jack Bruce is a great singer but his profile is the major visual. Save your money, buy the CDs,listen to the music, this DVD can drive you crazy it is so badly filmed. Hopefully there is some archived film out there, that will allow us to watch Cream perform as a band."
5,A surprising Excellent Video,I was surprised to see this video in a record store last year because it's rare to find Cream videos anywhere. The Buddy Guy interview basically describes the band in a nutshell. This is a better video than the Royal Albert Hall Farewell because there are complete versions of Crossroads and White Room.
1,Wrong format sent to my place,I ordered this DVD because I appreciate the Cream. I had ordered everything they have put out on DVD prior to this without any trouble. The vendor sent me the wrong format and after waiting weeks to get it - it was a real let down. I couldm't be bothered going all the trouble of shipping it back for a cheap DVD.
3,Best three piece band ever.,"Less talk & more action, please (one thumbs down). Some good concert footage, typical 60's filming (I likey). Hendrix, why only about 30 seconds worth (mad). The interviews with Ginger Baker are interesting (one thumbs up). The film is more a documentary than concert. Glad it's added to my collection, cause Cream footage is pretty rare."
3,Great hood but it comes with the lens,It looks like a couple of us have made the same mistake. Don't buy this because the 70-200 f4/0L already comes with it. I now have 2.
3,Glad!!,"I'm glad i didnt buy this. I just bought the lens on amazon.. hope to get it soon! Didnt get the item yet, so i just put 3 stars"
4,"Mellow, moody, magical, and very intimate.","I caught Karen on C.B.C. and ordered this CD immediately. The thing that struck me about her the moment I heard her was that the songs have the sound of a live night club performance, with only guitar and sometimes only base accompanying her. Without a lot of back up you can't have a weak voice. She doesn't. You get the feeling she could deliver a song well with no back up music at all. The songs are lovely old ballads with a nice light jazz feeling to them, similar to July London's style but with much sronger vocals. Great guitar and bass playing on it too."
2,sent broken item,After a long struggle to get the item I ordered it arrived and broke when i put it in reverse. I should have known when I found scraps of paper and cd shred in the the garbage can.I sent it back and I have not purchased another shredder.
3,"3-1/2 stars, but I would buy Kuran's 3-pack DVD instead","This film was interesting but I was expecting more based upon the topic and the item description. I thought my best and most interesting buy from Amazon by the same director (Kuran) was a 3-pack that included Atomic Bomb Movie, Atomic Journeys and Nukes in Space. I bought this single DVD to compliment the 3-pack, but it was a bit of a let down. Get the 3-pack."
5,Great Book! Finally Some Reality,"This was a great read. I applaud the authors for sharing their ""reality based"" experiences."
5,Enlightening and Educational!,"I don't typically leave feedback on books I read but I found this book simply outstanding. I read a lot of parenting books but I found the approach of parent and kids responding very refreshing and enlightening. I learned a ton, was shocked a lot, but feel better prepared to deal with my 2 sons (ages 12 and 14). I loved Doris' questions at the end of every chapter and have used several with success. Even though it is co-authored by a girl, it was very applicable to those of us who only have sons. Thanks for an excellent book and innovative approach to a topic every parent with teens needs to know."
5,The best book about modern teens I've ever read,"This book is terrific. Fascinating, provocative, funny, entertaining, wise.I couldn't put it down. The alternating voices of mother and daughter give it a liveliness and an energy that captivated me utterly. This is stuff for which all moms (in particular) should have an inexhaustible appetite.The authors do a sensitive and compelling job of communicating the drawbacks of many of the questionable behaviors that are discussed. Any parent who shares it with their teen will send a clear signal about the value of open communication,"
5,It's how I want to raise my teens,"Finally, a book that reflects the way I want to raise my soon-to-be teens, but I didn't know it! I'd read several books, all of which didn't touch a nerve until this one. It also helped me to realize it's time to connect up with other non-judgmental guerilla moms.I don't want to put my teens in a bubble, and then be in denial whenever the bubble bursts behind my back. Instead, I want to weather their teens with them, keep an open dialogue to a reasonable degree, and maintain my composure in their presence. How else can they develop their judgment than by some experimenting coupled with accountability and a parent to talk to? This parenting approach is not for the faint of heart, as it requires objectivity and self-honesty, but I'm ready. It also requires confidence that you've instilled good judgment in your kids.It's a relief to finally have a way of thinking about raising teens that works for me."
3,Not the Bible of Photography... but helpfull,"It is pretty basic, and does have a lot of information that doesn't really apply to what the book intends to.. As the computer information, viruses and stuff like it.Also, if you are looking for a book that will teach you all the technical information about photography.. This is not the one.. It will go through the basics of photography but not with a lot of details... Airball on this one.Lots of information about equipment, history and rules of ""HOW TO""'s to take a good snapshoot.There are other books in order to explain more about technical and principles of photography which this one does not cover pretty well."
4,of all the digital photography books out there..............,"Ok, so there are hundreds of digital photography books out there. I have a few myself. This book is one of the better ones in my opinion. It has wonderful color photos throughout. It does explain how to use with a computer (seems to like Apples better).Anyway, its a good book and fairly cheap. I bought mine from Costco for twentyfive bucks. Amazon's price is similar so I highly recommend it."
4,Great reference for the beginner,"With full color examples and many tips-and-tricks, I find the subjects in this book well suited for those who want to take their photography to the next level.There is something in ""Digital"" for everyone, but I find that it is written for photographers who want to advance their skills and techniques with digital cameras beyond the occasional family and/or social event. I guess you can call it an introduction to professional free-lance photography.Also, please be aware that some of the software demonstrations in the book may be dated by the time you read this. But all digital imaging software works pretty much the same, depending on your needs. This is not a big deal.Good book. For me, well worth the money."
5,Good update to a useful book.,"I was pleased to see that this excellent book has been updated. It's always been one of my favorites, with just the right mixture of technical detail and useful information."
2,Not for beginners,"If you are a beginner, learning photography and all the tricks you can do with it in a photoshop program you have on your computer, this book is not for you. I took a couple of photo / imaging classes and though this book was recommended by the instructor, IT IS NOT EASY FRIENDLY. It contains a lot of information but, nothing that is a step by step process in doing a project."
2,College Textbook,"I've bought this book 4 years ago, I think it was the FULLY UPDATED EDITION.To be honest, I couldn't complete it, it is too long and distracting.Too much writing, like a novel or something, it is not dirct to the point book.And when it comes to amateurs, 400 pages is too much to read.Also the photos in the book is so bad, like taken by a p & S camera.Anyway, this book is not recommended. If you want a direct to the point book, go for Scott Kelby's."
4,Digital Photographer's Handbook: Third Edition,Digital Photographer's Handbook: Third EditionQuick service. Delivered on time as promised and product came in as shown in picture.Thanks you!!
2,Confused,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed Richard Mason's first effort, ""The Drowning People"", I found this long-awaited second novel confusing. I guess the idea of looking at the same situation from three people's viewpoints -- where the narrative of each of them is in the first person -- could be found interesting but it didn't strike me that way.In ""Us"", I found the writing style ""excessively literary"", almost like showing off. This is not the Richard Mason I've met and conversed with and I do hope that he returns in the future with a book that better displays his skill at writing nuances and small details that add such richness to his work."
1,Wrong item,"Ordered it on Mar. 4, 2005.This item turns out to be a USB 2.0 Hub from techdepot.com.It's totally wrong! Watch out! Don't place an order on this one."
1,Bad Hardware in Q Stor qu2fcb PCMCIA card,Purchased the Q Store USB 2.0 + Firewire Combo Cardbus card new and all it does is lock the Win XP OS up HARD. Pull the card out and the OS reboots. Safe mode does same thing. Q Store offers no resolution to the problem. Do NOT buy no matter how cheap.
5,I love Eric Clapton,"This DVD brings Eric Clapton into your living room while he performs his most well known work. He is energetic, creative, and supremely talented. Okay, I am a real fan and I have seen him in concert more times than I can count, but I still like being able to watch him whenever I like. A good concert to go along with this one is his concert for Crossroads where he invites and teams with some of the blues greats."
1,it stinks out loud!,"Nothing great, poor filming and sound. Don't bother to watch this one. Get rod stewarts storyteller if you want a good one."
4,Quite good,"As Clapton videos go this one is pretty good -- not as great as Unplugged but better than some of the others from the 70s/80s. Overall a good video for fans, with a nice mix of old and new(er) footage.Good Points:- E.C.: Layla, Cocaine, Wonderful Tonight, etc.- Cream: Strange Brew, Sunshine of My Love, I feel Freee- Rare Yardbirds footage- for guitarists, the footage shows his playing (e.g fretting hand) better than many videos.Interesting:- Duet with Tina TurnerNot so good points:- No Blues Breakers footage :(- Too early for of the 90s blues, Change the World & Nor Tears in heaven- a few non-descript songs from the 70s/80s(?)"
4,Vintage Clapton....,"This would have been worth it just for the fact it had the original Layla (spliced from several performances, including one with Phil Collins backing up on drums. Now, I do like Clapton's accoustic version, but the original is so different that it is almost like two different songs. Bonus is frankly, everything else-- including 'Cocaine.' I also own 'Chronicles,' which I would also recommend. But to get the old stuff, electronic versions intact, better snatch this up. It is getting harder to find...."
3,"The film was only okay, but the service getting it was great.","I was in a time crunch and got this in good time, although the movie itself wasn't quite my cup of tea."
5,THE BEST STORIES EVER WRITTEN,When I read these stories for the first time I was about fifeteen years old. I was trying to understand the world and O'Henry's stories helped me to do it. I keep reading these stories and I keep trying to understand the world.
5,Striking Selections,Kudos to the editors who could put together a selection to keep O'Henry alive for the today's readers as fresh and warm as the stories were hundred years ago.
3,O my word,"21 Stories would probably have been more enjoyable. O. Henry is certainly an interesting author, but every single story in this collection (and perhaps in his entire body of work, for all I know) tries for the ""ironic twist"" ending. I enjoy irony as much as the next person, but after a couple dozen stories, irony would have been finding a straightforward tale, and it would have been most welcome. This large collection dulls the edge of irony."
5,Spirit in the Sky!!!!!!,I had this album in vinyl back when.Spirit in the Sky is a classic Rock must have. Not really typical of the rest of Mr. Greenbaum's work as I see it. Norman Greenbaum has a quirky kind of appeal when I am in the right mood.Spirit in the Sky is my favorite cut. Rather than get it on some compilation album I opted to get the full CD. Which also gives you the bonus Spirit in the Sky demo version and Save Me for a Rainy Day.I was glad to revisit Milk Cow and Good Lookin' Woman.
3,Not as I remember it.,"I was one of those kids who bought the single, and for fun, played the b-side. That's how I was familiar with Milk Cow and Canned Ham (Irony) The demo versions are the stars on this CD. They remind me of Jonathan Edwards (Sunshine) and i wish Mr. Greenbaum would have stuck with that formula. Perhaps his career would have lasted a lot longer than just the one famous song and some minor hits."
5,Fabulous,"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Board Game is fabulous in all aspects. The great price, the endless amount of questions, the quality of the gameplay, and the overall family fun. The only complaint is some questions are out of place, for example, several $500 dollars questions were hard enough to be around $4000 or $8000, while there were several $2000 to $8000 questions that should have been lower. But this is only minor considering how many questions there are and most of them are excellent questions. The game is great to play everyone on their own all at once, or everyone together teaming up to get the million bucks. Fabulous."
2,fair game,hard to phone a friend if they're all sitting around the table playing against you. ask the audience is the same deal. the game seemed easier to play without using these two.
4,Why doesn't a game that's called a board game have a board?,"I like the game and it can be lots of fun but I was disappointed that there wasn't a board with it since it was called a board game. Why wasn't 'board' left out of the name if it wasn't to be played on one?This may seem a small factor, but I didn't get what I expected."
5,Many more questions than the PC game. You get to be Regis!,"It is great! It has almost 2000 questions (20 times more than the PC game), and you can take turns being the host! The game is enough fun for the whole family. Highly recommended. Hopefully, they will sell question additions later in the year."
3,Who Wants To Play This Game? Some of us.,"This boardgame is constructed really well... and for some reason reminds me of the old board game, ""Family Feud"". It gives you that feeling of the US television show (sans music) and provides you with that feeling that you're playing ""20 questions"" on steroids. So even though it catches the feeling of the television show, how fun can it really be?It's a great party game the first times around, but then it loses it's appeal very quickly. The reason is probably because you need people to have the same amount of interest as the actual players, or else it just seems like a large tedious workout of random information. So if you have a Who Wants To Be a Millionaire party... then it should do fine. But by yourself, it's probably going to prop up that crooked table of yours.All in all: Good party game; good ice breaker. Lousy 1 player game. You want 1 player? Go get the computer version... at least there's music with that one."
1,Incorrect Answers,I was looking forward to playing this game when I received it for Christmas. After answering 30-40 questions I gave up. At least three answers to the questions were incorrect. We verified this through research. What fun is a semi-trivia game if correct answers don't matter?? I won't play it again.
2,Don't waste your money!,"This game was REALLY disappointing. We will use the cards to ask trivia questions, but it is really not fun. Your lifelines are limited to the people you are playing with/against. The kids did not have fun. Neither did the parents. Our feeling was that Pressman Toy company needed to come up with a game and just threw something together. Again. don't waste your money."
3,Educational but not entertaining...,"I am not saying it is a bad game... no! But for non Americans, this game is not easy. You have got to be living in the US to do well in this game. When the questions becomes more difficult, it becomes more Global than based on the US... here comes a better chance for people like me to enjoy it more.I found this game to be more of educational than fun...But if you live in the states, I think you'll see it differently and enjoy this game even more..!"
5,Very pleased!,"I was not quite sure how this game would turn out, but it was a blast to play with my husband. At times we would just pull out the cards and ask each other questions. When we had the chance... two little ones are running around most of the time... we would actually sit down a play. I am picky about games, but this one is actually quite entertaining and not complicated at all.Recommended!"
2,Not what I hoped for.,"I got this game to use in play therapy with older kids (12-14), but found too many of the questions were too outdated. Also, there simply aren't enough questions. If you were to play this just a few times, you'd have learned all the answers. The money is flimsy (what else!)and a pain to manage in a short time. This might be fun for adults, but didn't hit what I was aiming for with the kids."
5,Few ways to do it better!,"As board game adaptations go, this is one of the best yet. The game comes with 5 little card consoles, with a window for the question, the 4 possible answers, a hole on the back to show the host the answer, and four orange sliding slats. They're very attractive, and excellent quality. The host uses it to show other players the question, and the other players use their consoles to indicate their answers. The lifelines differ from the show slightly, but are designed such that a player will never necessarily get screwed over by someone with bad intentions.The one thing I'd recommend is to get the show's soundtrack and use that along with the game. It's a regular feature of our sessions and you would not believe how much it adds to the atmosphere."
3,This is an okay game,"If you've never seen the show, don't buy it. If you've seen the show, maybe. The questions are entertaining and fun. But be prepared to constantly slide cards in and out of holders, deal out money, and try to figure out which of the other players you're going to use for your phone-a-friend. This game is okay if you have a group of 5-6 people, but if you have four or less, it can be a little difficult to use lifelines. My family sometimes uses all 50-50s instead of phone-a-friend and ask the audience. All in all, this is a pretty good game that might need a few improvements. If they put out a new version with improvements over this one, I'd buy it."
3,Very educational but not very fun.,"When I first got this game I was very happy since I love Who Wants to Be a Millionare. But when I first played it, it was kind of dissapointing. The educational value is great. For the firt 10-20 games it's fun but after that you start getting repeats of questions and that drops the fun. Basically when you play your friend whoever wins is the person who has played more and memorized more questions. It also gets very annoying having to take cards out, put cards in and get everything in the right place after each turn. Most of the questions have to do with the US so if you live somewhere else there's a great disadvantage."
3,will it meet your needs?,"Good Information and background, but for a book Titled ""His Graphic Art"" the number and size of reproductions is a little low. Dont buy it for more than thirty dollars unless you want some biographical information, and a smattering of small reproductions."
3,Used Battery Marked New,"The battery took almost 2 weeks to arrive and it was used. How can I tell? It had scratches on it, and was a bit dented. I am giving 3 stars because it holds a charge after 1 month and was cheap. I might have given 4 stars if they advertised the battery as being used."
2,USED BATTERY!!!,"I received the battery very quickly, but it was a used battery!!! I have a used battery now why would I want another one!!! I guess when they put new it means new to me!!! I would pay a little more and get something that was actually NEW!!!"
1,Poor,"The audiobook was labeled ""very good""condition. It came worn and edges of box chewed up. I was giving as a gift bc my parents like us to order used to be green. However, I like to order in good condition. Disappointed."
5,Makes carrying those bags so comfortable!,"This product is outstanding! From its soft grip, to its finger spaces, I no longer have red markes on my hands from carrying shopping bags. I even take it with me to the dry cleaners and use it with the hangers. I love it so much I bought two--I keep one in my car all the time and the other near the door when I am ready to go out again.---Marge"
3,MISLEADING,"THIS DVD DOESN'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE ARTIST MENTION ON THE LIST WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SUPREMES AND THE FOUR TOPS. ARTIST ON THIS DVD ARE THE ROLLING STONES, SONNY & CHER, THE ASSOCIATION AND OTHER ARTIST THAT WERE NEVER WITH MOTOWN. THE DVD IS O.K. AND THE ARTIST ARE REFRESHING BUT I WANTED TO SEE MOTOWN."
5,EXCELLENT - 2 THUMBS UP!,"This was an excellent little 30 minute video on anger. It is unrealistic to think a child won't get angry and this show how to deal with it in a more productive way. The idea that Christianity has no violence is silly, read the bible, hence ""David and Goliath"" theme. That was pretty violent. I hope they make a bunch of these. We loved it and my almost 6 year old laughed out loud! Thanks for making an upbeat way to discuss anger issues."
5,So much fun!,"We love Junior's Giants! It couldn't be any better! I hope they produce tons of these! I hear that there is a #2 out there, but I can't find it anywhere to buy.Oh, and unlike the other reviewer, I thought that the ""Anger's Everywhere"" rendition of ""Love is in the Air"" Was super funny! My kids bust out for that and disco dance through the house to it. There is just something funny about a kilt-wearing angry scottsman singing while disco dancing. :)"
2,"Terrible Shaver, Ok Trimmer","The trimmer works ok. I like the extension handle to reach low on my back but because of the weight of the machine, it is hard to control. The shaver is by far the worst I've used. Practically useless and does a terrible job cutting stubble.This was a great concept and a first on the market but certainly needs an upgrade before I could recommend it to anyone."
1,Just Ask Your Neighbor to Shave Your Back,"Stay away from this product. It's useless. I got the ""Man Groomer"" ...it was much more effective if you want your back shaved...haaaaaaaaaa...."
5,GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT PRICE,This item is a great value and solved most of my problems with my car.No one even came close on the price for this.This was shipped at a very good price also.
2,Verbatim Wireless Rechargeable Mouse,"I purchased this mouse to use with my Macbook to avoid having to buy batteries and because I liked the way the receiver stores inside the mouse. However, the performance can be spotty. It seems like it is particularly sensitive to interference maybe? Sometimes the pointer will quit responding for a moment. It is worse when I use it with the computer at school. I was also disappointed with the limited information on Verbatim's website and the fact that their tech support did not return my email and answer my questions."
5,Good choise,It is really effective that the batteries can be recharged inside the mouse. It has an ideal size for me and it has a nice design.
5,the best ever,"the best mouse i ever had, i works fine, and i love the recharge option, it works as a wired mouse while charges, so you never need to put it away and wait until charged.Small enough to fit on a pocket but big enough no to be inconfortable to use it.Its a true traveler mouse. Buy it, you dont be disappointed."
1,Bad scroll botton,It is a bad copy of the BenQ mouse. The unique good feature is that it is rechargable with any USB port of your PC. But the scroll allways is scrolling bad.
4,It'll do the job,"This trimmer is a good light-weight workhorse. I used it to edge my grass along the concrete and it did a good job plowing thru 6-inch thick chunks of crabgrass and dirt so I think it does have a good amount of power to it. It handled the rest of my trimming with ease. It's a bit more of a struggle to put together than most trimmers (I've owned several). The metal guard bar on the front of the trimmer just refuses to stay on no matter what you do so I use it without that: I haven't noticed any problem with functionality or safety. The bump feed doesn't work terribly well either, but that's true of every other trimmer I've owned too! Overall, this trimmer will the do what the average homeowner needs a trimmer to do."
1,ONE TIME USE,This has been a one-time use product. The second time I went to use it it burned up. I guess you get what you pay for. I would not buy this product again.
4,Very Reliable,"I've used the Black and Decker ST4000 string trimmer for several years; I have been quite pleased with it except that it doesn't seem to hold up to frequent use. I do only my own yard, so I don't think I've been abusive to it."
4,no longer available,The ST4000 is no longer made. It has been replaced. You can get the newer one at Lowe's a lot cheeper.
2,Nothing but a cheap toy,"I purchased this edger, because I love the bump feed as opposed to the auto feed trimmers which I have never had luck with. The bump feature did not work well for me with this trimmer. Because of this, I am constantly having to turn the trimmer over to re-feed the line. This trimmer is a joke and can not be recommended."
1,Don't Waste your Money,"Pros- cheapCons- There is just no other way to put it. This is crap. You have to constantly fix the string, unplug turn it upside down take off the cap (and this is not easy, I am 62 and have small hands and can't reach and use the pressure needed to remove. I have to use something to pry it open. Then minutes later I am doing it all over and over and over. I never even made it to the back yard before I threw the dam thing away."
4,Nice Trimmer,This is a good trimmer and can easily be used by anyone as it's light weight. The string will break in thick grass but the bump feature is wonderful.
1,A real,I received this last week and went to work on our yard which has not been landscaped yet. When I ran into a large weed like a milkweed the thing bogged down and broke off the string inside the spool. It's nothing more than a toy and the landed price... is way out of line. Back to SEARS. In the future all of my purchases from AMAZON will be books!!!
2,B%D TRIMMER,"Buyers should be aware this trimmer requires a cord. You will need to buy a long extention cord for this. Has no battery. Once you buy the cord at your local hardware store and try it, the trimmer does work fairly well for light work."
4,Mighty Mouse,"For a 12"" trimmer, it is light and has enough power.The head is easily reversed (pushbutton) for edge trimming.The only letdown, it uses 1.65 mm string instead of the better 2 mm heavy duty line from WeedEater.The trimmer will use up the thin line in a hurry.:-( You have to enlarge the string retainer hole in the spool slightly in order to be able to fit the slightly thicker string. But that is easy.They say in the owners manual it will overheat the motor if you use a bigger diameter string.But it will run powerfully, even with the 2 mm string and it does not overheat either.As long as you realize the limitations of a 12"" trimmer, it works just fine.BTW, the 2 year warranty is not bad either."
2,Electric Edger,"I purchased this edger a few years ago. It seemed to work fine at first but, the only issue I have with it is the string. When the last of the string is gone, you have to take a spool of string purchased and pull enough string for this edger and wrap around the spool. The problem is that when you place the cap back on to keep the spool in place, it sometimes pops off when you press the trigger. Once or twice the spool cap popped off and struck me in the face. It was a good thing I was wearing eye and face protection. Don't ever operate one of these edgers without face protection. When the strong hits rocks they go flying. I always tell my wife to make sure our daughter is no where around when I'm operating this devise and that includes my wife too! I ended up buying a gas powered one made by Craftsman."
4,Light and handy...,"this trimmer is very light and gets very close to the weed you want to trim...much much better than the Craftmen stuff from Sears, which is head heavy and bulky...AND short lived! BUT...the bumper head wears down quickly, which makes string feeding unreliable. That means you have to manually remove the cap and adjust. Solution: Get a new bumper head reel when it worn."
1,Outdated and simplistic,"I suspect this book was barely on the leading edge when it was first published. The style is over-simplified. The margins with terminology and definitions are distracting. The personal stories are pretty sad and pathetic, especially Sharon's story, which is dispersed throughout the book.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is even slightly internet-savvy."
1,Cloying and Done Before,"I know lots of people who liked this book a lot, but when I finally read it I felt differently. I found Drew to be another one of Rad's tortured dark heroines with post-traumatic stress syndrome (and she's done that before, in nearly every book) while Sean was cloyingly sweet and -- for a therapist -- annoyingly angst-ridden about the slightest little things. For someone who should know better, playing the sad stoic was her only way to deal with her problems.I totally agree that Rad's writing just gets better, and there is a lot of sexual heat in the book that was good. It's just I've read this general story before from Rad. PTSS has been done to death."

5,Awesome Read,"Another great work for a great author. Radclyffe continues to hold my interest with well-developed characters, interesting story lines and well written prose. Another great read!"
2,out of date advertisement for CA Spectrum,"Was very disappointed in this book. Little useful informtion, in terms of managing business networks. The book is a 200 page advertisement for CA Spectrum"
2,A Little Disappointed,"Was disappointed to find that my favorite picture - Stanford After-Brunch 2000, was split between two pages so that you were unable to get a look at it and really apprecaite it. May want to let other buyers know that the cover that is shown is not the cover that is actually on the book - Wish a viewer could peak inside and actually see if it is what they are looking for. Other than that it is what one would expect to find in any other art book."
2,"I like the artist, but",This is a small book with a fairly limited selection of pictures of his work. Also one of his best works Stanford-after-brunch 2000 is slit on two pages. Don't pay over 20.00 for a new copy.
2,temperature control primative,"I want to poach my fish and chicken, not boil them. However the temperature control set to 200 which is recommended will go in and out of a rapid boil. I have to turn it way down to warm to keep it out of the boil and then the recipe times do not work. It has a broad range of degrees before it clicks on to warm the water again. Just not precise enough to set with in a specific poach temperature range. I contacted Cuisinart and they said they did not have a replacement temperature control prong plug insert (apparently out of production with no replacement parts) She said she did not even have a demo to try it out but found a picture of it. She recommended I contact the seller. I did contact my seller but never got a return on my complaint. I decided to work with it defective as it was but now I wish I had returned it. I never use it."
3,"Less evolved than the Federal edition, but gets job done if...","As with all software, the user interface and its workflow has its quirks. Some of it you may find counter-intuitive and not very helpful.The State edition is less evolved than the Federal edition. It expects more things of the user to know. It is almost seamlessly integrated into the Federal edition of the software. If you have a fairly straight-forward tax situation and you already know what you are supposed to do tax-wise, then this is a convinient alternative to pen/paper and a lot cheaper than going to a specialist when you send in all the rebates."
5,"Yes, thank you very much!","Finally...*sigh*...my wish came true. Clear and in digital, it's been so wonderful to hear these songs again. Yet another fan who kept all the 12""'s neatly stored, but was always longing to hear ""Secret Oktober"", ""Faith In This Colour"" or ""TigerTiger"" ~ thank you. It's these groups of songs that taught this one how to listen at an early age..."
5,The Capstone to my Duran Duran collection,"I first came across Duran Duran when I was 11 years old (1981), and have been a fan ever since. While I own almost every single one of these EP's and singles on vinyl (what's that?), I rarely listen to them, because, as I'm sure is the case with many of you out there, my record player is [junk] and I don't want to wreck them. So now I have them on CD. Excellent! If you only know the later works on Duran Duran, you're in for a real treat. At the forefront of the New Romantic movement, their early work was sometimes darker than people remember. Songs such as ""Like an Angel,"" ""Faster Than Light,"" and ""Faith in This Colour"" are melodic and beautiful, but they portray a darker side of one of pop's greatest bands. Well worth the pricetag to have access to all of this great, lost work."
4,Nostalgia in a box,"What took so long?? It is my personal belief that Duran Duran's b-sides (particularly ""Faster Than Light"", ""Like an Angel"" and ""Khanada"") were better than many of the tracks that made it onto their early albums. Unfortunatley Capitol has chosen to distribute these lost gems over 13 CD's by packaging them in minature reproductions of their original 12"" sleeves. It's a nice nod to nostalgia, but it is frustrating to have to shuffle through all these CD's to cherry pick the best of this compilation. It has to be said that many of the early ""night versions"" have not dated well at all and sound hopelessly campy in hindsight. The stronger remixes found here include the 12"" remix of ""Hold Back the Rain"", the dance mix of ""The Reflex"" and the monster mix of ""Is There Something I Should Know""."
5,Made me Smile,Awesome Duran Duran box set - the songs were neatly compiled in beautifully arranged mini looking album covers. Really brought back alot of memories. I would recommend this to all true Duranies!
4,Nice Set - Too many cd's,"This is a great collection. Ideal for somebody who has all their old Duran music on tapes. However, the only complaint I have is that the songs are put on individual cd's like the original releases (3 to 4 songs on each CD). While this is ""cute"" and one might appreciate looking at the old album covers (in minature cd form of course!), it makes it kind of a pain if you want to just listen to a bunch of old Duran songs! You have to keep switching out the CD's every 10 minutes or so! I suppose if you have a multi cd player then this won't matter to you!Nonetheless, I would recommend this box set, just wish they offered it on few CD's!!!"
3,"An excellent idea, but suffers from over-compression.","It's really tiring, listening to the newly mastered CDs and noticing they don't sound as good as even the early mastered CDs.I end up keeping *both* versions, and listen to the original normally. If I want to hear the 'special fatures' that the remasters have, then and only then do I put them on.Looking at the wave forms on these CDs (as with most of the newly remastered CD), you see plenty of clipping. I really wish the record companies would quit this line of thinking that 'louder is better'. It ruins so many great additions to these CDs.'The Singles' is a wonderful recreation of all the original singles that Duran Duran put out. I would recommend it highly for anyone who followed them early in their career as I had. Again, I just wish they hadn't compressed the music. Admittedly, it's not as bad as some others I've heard/seen, but there's still no reason for it."
1,Don't get me wrong...,"I love DD and all of these songs. But we already have all the singles on Greatest, and heck, before that on Decade. The remixes are already on Essential Night Versions and Strange Behaviour (all of which I bought). What the fans wanted were the B-sides they didn't have on CD. Now, the record company could have sold us those...on one CD, but instead decided to [charge more] for 13 (good lord) CDs instead...And the RIAA wonders why people are sharing mp3 files.Greedy record companies, great band. What can you do?"
1,could anything get worse than this,i really doubt if you could find a worse musical compilation than this set.why would this awful band have to bring out 13 cd's when they could have fit all the songs into 3 cd's is something i cannot understand. [...]
2,Battery Charge Doesn't Last Long,"This sprayer performed great while the batteries were charged. The pressure was even and the tip made a nice, fine spray. The trouble is no matter how long I charged the batteries, they would go dead after spraying only about 1.5 gallons of liquid -- they couldn't even empty one tank-full of liquid. This caused big problems for the project I was working on. The product description says that it can spray ""up to"" 9 gallons of liquid on a single battery charge. Either my unit has some battery problems or B&D is wildly exagerating. ..."
3,Cordless Power Sprayer,"This sprayer is a good idea but we have found some problems. We have 80 acreas and the terrain is not always perfectly smooth. The tank tips and twists a lot. I also have trouble rolling over the line with the wheels and getting tangled in the line. We've only used the sprayer about 6 times and the batteries will only stay charged for more than about 10 minutes. When I charged and used the new batteries, just out of the carton, they would only stay charged about the same amount of time. Therefore, you cannot spray much! Actually, we would like to return the sprayer because of these problems but the store would not since it sat in the garage all winter! The idea is good!"
4,Sprayer Rocks,"Pros:No more sore muscle joints from using a hand pump model,or a backpack sprayer.Plus your neighbors will be Jealous.Cons:Wheelbase needs to be a little wider, Better tireswould be nice.Comment;I purchased two in 2002. I own 2 1/2 acresand put them to use every summer (Round-up for one).(Malathion for the other). This item Rocks"
5,Great upgrade,Great upgrade to the old style clock. Installed on a none Multrie and it works great !!
2,Cheaply produced timer,"I used this timer on multiple feeders to replace malfunctioning timers. The Moultrie digital timer will work well and exactly as advertised out of the box. However, after being outside and not in a plastic box, the timer will fail within one year of use. The only digital timer that I have not experienced problems with is the more expensive ""The Timer""."
2,Mcdonalds,"Not a show,only a bike safety lesson for parents and Kids. My children didnt like it becuz they wanted a show"
1,In retrospect ...,"...these guys gave some dreadful advice. They recommended the bonds of Bear Stearns, Lehman and ABN Amro. All are worthless now."
2,Not worth the money- get something else.,"Although the book has great illustrations, it just doesn't give much information. Yes, the author discusses the sharpening of virtually every cutting instrument, but usually only using a certain jig that you probably don't have. There is little depth to this book; it's like a vast ocean that is only an inch deep. The book is a better review of sharpening tools and jigs on the market than it is about sharpening, and if you have these tools, you don't need the book to tell you how to use them.I would have liked to see in-depth sharpening information- what a tool that is sharp looks like and how to get it there with basic tools. The book rarely achieves this."
4,A Great Read,"Rome In The East evaluates the reciprocal cultural exchange of the Western and Eastern ends in the Roman Empire. The book traces Roman history from the early empire and integrates Roman hegemony throughout the Near East, Arabia, and Palestine. The author raises the stimulating argument that the East influenced the Western Roman Empire more than vice versa. Each section separates into a topical format that includes towns, cities, countryside, and architecture. In fact, the author devotes much space to a pictorial layout of monuments, buildings, and artifacts. Importantly, the author recognizes the influence Christianity had on the Roman world."
5,Excellent,"I've had the cd a few days and can't stop listening to it. This whole album is very solid! Songs like Sleepwalking, Wait, Faster, Man in Control, Breakdown, Tug, and Steal a Car are all fabulous!"
3,"Disappointing...but hey, it's Seven Mary Three","I may be disappointed with this one, but Seven Mary Three is still in my top ten. ""Wait"" is the only song that has caught my attention so far. If you're looking for ROCK CROWN caliber songs, look else where."
1,I was taken in at first,"The book is VERY inspirational. Reading it, one catches the passion and excitement of laser dentistry that I'm sure must inspire the good doctor. Oh if the reality were but the same. Some people are great on paper and a disaster in practice. In my experience, there are far more effective and inexpensive ways to optimal dental health, like ozone for disinfecting for example. Also, if one has had any previous dentistry, most laser techniques cannot be used. I know. Been there, done that. I couldn't be more disgusted and disappointed between the difference of theory and practice."
3,Foxfarm is good but inconsistent.,"I think this soil works great with tomatoes. The soil is really heavy and holds moisture for a long time. Sometimes seedlings burn in this stuff if they are small. I used to use this all the time but it seems like it is more prone to gnats and its easy to over water. Mixing perlite is a good idea if you plan on using this indoors. Its dense enough and has enough nutrients to grow 7' tall tomato plants in 3 gallon pots indoors (combined with foxfarm growbig liquid nutrients), no joke! :) I have had a couple bags get 'green mildew' on the first inch of soil, and actually I had a couple of weeds (they look like sprouts). It wasn't a result of my grow conditions because my grow room is spotless and is swept and bleached all the time. I'm going try this soil again with cucumbers soon."
1,Owned by Monsanto,"I used to love this soil until it was bought out by Monsanto. Now, the batches of soil are made in such large quantities that each bag varies in quality. Not to mention, I don't buying soil from the corporate giant that supports genetic modification of food and a very un-organic way of agriculture. It is not the same product that it once was."
4,Good quick read,"Good book for a beginner wanting to learn the basics of Craps and easy stratagies to win. I read the book in a few hours and was able to apply his strategy and money management techniques very quickly. I applied what I learned by playing craps online and was able to ""win"" $1,700 in one session. Looking to go to Vegas soon to apply what I've learned at a real craps table! I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn all about the game. It's not as scary as it looks."
5,$100 Bucks in 10-Minutes,"The first 5-chapters were enough to earn me $100 in 10-minutes at a San Juan Casino. It worked like clockwork, almost magic. And I did just what the book said: ""I took my money and ran"". Looking forward to trying my luck again."
3,entertaining but strained,"Remake of ""Bob Le Flambeur"", misses more than hits it's mark.The first problem is that it is inferior to the original in almost every way, although color, modern setting, and well known Nolte make for more accessibility to US crowd. Amusing to see a film in France with almost no French spoken,,,,even the French cops speak english to each other!Nutsa is a real beauty, but the movie falls flat in it's rush towards a modern day fairy tale. Not one shred of realism, not even a whiff...."
4,A visual treat.,"Stylish and cool. The look of this movie is delicious: not just the spectacular scenery, but the camera shots, the lighting, the editing. Great, international cast. Nolte is perfect as Bob the gentleman junkie gambler. He mumbles through the whole film, but I probably would too if I was Bob, so it seems character-appropriate. Noir-ish, but with enough levity to prevent the gloom from being overwhelming. Fun soundtrack, too."
5,He's getting better!,Nick Nolte was never a favorite of mine until he made a comedy with Bette awhile back (Movie name: Down and out in Beverly Hills). And he is really good in this movie. I felt that I really knew this character--maybe we can thank Neil Jordan for that--he's also great--but I think Nick is finally maturing in his acting. The scenery is wonderful too. Felt like going to Monte Carlo myself. Don't miss this.
2,not that good a movie if you are a ralph fiennes fan,"I wanted to treat myself to a well-deserved gift and stupidly purchased this DVD without knowing anything about it. Afterall, it did have a picture of Ralph Fiennes on it. Imagine my disappointment when he barely showed up in the film. This is a movie for Nick Nolte fans. And it is certainly not a very good movie at that. I have to admit that I didn't even finish it as my copy was faulty with stops and fast forwards. Ralph Fiennes fans hold onto your money -- one day he may decide to appear in a really good film again."
3,WHAT A WASTE,"This film was another deep disappointement. Everything what could have missed was missed there. In this film I saw a very good story, which was almost impossible to screw up. This story could make one of the greatest films if not for Nick Nolte and for the rest of the group. The film is very weak, primitive, I would say. I gave it three stars only out of respect for the past."
5,Nolte and newcomer - a cult classic?,"the music, the characters, the mood are carefully revealed and they are captivating, endearing, and timelessly delightfully presented in a flimsey vehicle of hope. yet, i keep returning to a favorite location in a culturally dense zone where simplicity prevails. one of Nolte's best. and, when or where will this youthful Nutsa reappear?"
4,"It's in English, but be sure to have subtitles ""On""!","People who enjoy heist films with lovable criminals addicted to hard drugs will like this film. It is beautifully filmed in France and Monte Carlo, and veers between sentimental characters using hardboiled dialogue.Speaking of dialogue (hey, a joke!), I recommend that English speaking viewers use the ""English subtitle"" DVD option. Not in order to translate the occasional French lines, but to figure out what Nick Nolte is mumbling in English!"
5,One of Nolte's Best,"This flick is really one of his best. Most of the other actors are virtually unknown in the U.S., which is too bad because they really do a great job. Ralph Finnes has a tiny, but intense part in this that helps make it a really tense and sexy heist movie. It's kind of in the same vein as Ronin. It's also a lot of fun."
3,It is what it is,"Nick Nolte's mumbling and asthmatic whispering will challenge your tv's sound system. Still, this heist flick is a cut above some others. Interesting unknown cast, though the plot about a casino art theft is something you'll think you've seen before. The scenes between Nolte and the teen Russian prostitute are very good. It's worth watching because it's higher quality that it could have been."
1,SLOOOOOWWWWW,"I rented this movie because Nick Nolte was starring in it and his movies are usually pretty good. On my first attempt to look at this movie, I fell asleep. On my second attempt (days later) I fell asleep again. I never got past the scene at the casio when he and his parter were discussing stealing paintings from the casino. I guess watching a burned out heroin junkie having a friendly relationship with a 17 yr old runaway, who really wanted to sleep with him, does not hold my interest.When Nolte's character wanted to get clean, he wasn't doing it for his own health, he was doing it so he can be sober for the next big heist."
1,Lousy Plot,"This movie is called The Good Thief. What about Good Grief? The acting was okay (it seemed easy for Nick Nolte to play himself!) The story was dull and uninspiring. When I bought this movie, I thought it was going to be something like Ocean 11, but it wasn't. Instead, it tried to mesh too many different ideas at once. I'd say the worst part about this movie had to do with the girl Nick Nolte was with. What was her purpose, anyway? No one really says why she is even in the movie.There were times I thought this was a low budget movie. In any case, this is a great movie if you want to feel depressed and feel that you're superior in that you could create something better. But if you don't have that as your purpose, don't rent or buy it.Michael"
1,"I HAVE HAD FOR BETTER BY ERIC ""FINALLY ERIC BURDON AND THE ANIMALS""","i asked for r&b; in concert/music. i get a bunch of talk. VERY DISAPPOINTEDI HAVE 33 1/3 BY THE ANIMALS, THAT ARE 200% BETTER THAN THIS. I WASTED MY $33.00 DOLLARDS????????"
4,BEAUTIFUL CD!!!,"GREAT FIRST CD FOR COUNTRY SINGER MEREDITH EDWARDS!!! This is an EXCELLENT cd that I would recommend to anyone that likes female country music. Meredith and her music have a catchy, pop sense, yet it NEVER waivers from the Country sound and music that it is. I would recommend ""In Any Given Moment"" (1), ""The Bird Song"" (3), and ""Ready to Fall"" (4). These songs provide a great example of the vocal ability that Meredith Edwards has, and also gives a sense of what type of music is on the album. It is real life topics- happy, sad, and everything in between. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND MEREDITH EDWARD'S CD ""REACH."" Give this incredibly talented new comer a try!"
5,Love It!,"I bought this cd the day it came out, along with Jessica Simpson and Trisha Yearwood's new ones. It is my fav out of the three. I listen to it all the time and love it! I highly recommend this cd to anyone who likes good music."
3,CD has new mixes,"This is a great collection of ripping blues songs by members of Deep Purple and friends. However, this CD has all new mixes of the songs. I actually prefer the mixes that were on the original vinyl release, and wish they included the old mixes along with the new mixes on this CD.Have to give this CD 3 stars, for not including the original mixes of the songs."
3,Just so so.,1. The sound seems to be hollow (low frequency lost?).2. The battery chamber is not designed well. Only batteries with round shaped edges would fit. Duracell's for example do not fit.3. There is no spring to hold the battery tight.4. One of the mic I bought has a problem that it cannot be turned off (even in off position). I found this after I lost two batteries. Had to unscrew it now after each use.
4,Buying soon,I am a mobile DJ and i borrowed this set up from a friend and for what i need it for it works great i am buying one soon.
1,It's a Pyle alright!,Big waste of money. You get what you pay for. After buying these I decided to stop being so cheap and bought some real mics. The name says it all except the name Pyle should be with and I instead of Y and the second word would not be pro.
2,feature missing,"Good for the price, which is cheap. The description promises switchable frequencies. That is not so. You take your chances with what you get."
4,Find yourself in trance dance,This book gives good background information about history of trance dance and cultures that have used it. Good descriptive info on elements involved and how to do it. Quick easy read.
3,A brief biography,"Viktor Reimann's biography of Joseph Goebbles is informative and readable, but ultimately lacking. Reimann brings a German perspective to Goebbles, but ultimately fails to really penetrate the legend on the man. Checking in at only 326 pages, and including many of Goebbles's speeches and writings verbatim, it leaves the reader with only a skeletal sketch."
3,Hitlist rarity,"I only bought this title for the extremmely rare track by the English group 'Hitlist' called 'Into the Fire'. Superb mastering and the first time I've found it on CD anywhere in the World. So well done EMI/Virgin Canada for licensing the track for this compilation.The rest of the CD is 'okay' but not for me, hence the lack of stars."
4,Vicious Pink,"Worth three or four times the price for ""Take Me Now"" alone. The rest is just icing. And tasty icing at that."
5,Leap of Faith,"This review is going to be short, sweet, and down to the point. This is single handedly the greatest wrestling DVD ever made. I have watched it five times over and It still hasn't gotten old. If you are a wrestling fan, this DVD is a must-have."
4,Wild Timothy,"By: Ricky PenaTimothy Martin a young teenage city boy goes camping with his dad. While he is there he learns a little about the outdoors. He also reads a lot of books to help him. While he and his dad were out there Timothy wonders off and gets lost! Now he has to live off what he knows about the outdoors. It's a good thing he read a lot about the woods! While he is out there he learns to boil water, start a fire, and learns what is good food to eat also he learns how to make a very well made shelter that he can live in while he is out there"
2,Ruined by the half-@$$ audio,"I am a cellist and very sensitive to the audio aspects of movies. The original Gumby show created by Clokey in 1950s featured a beautiful orchestral soundtrack matching its classic clay medium and video presentation. When re-adapted in the 1980s, the awesome soundtrack was replaced by a crappy Casio keyboard. It breaks my heart to watch these dubbed over episodes. I wish I knew why the people who re-released Gumby PAID to have the AUDIO DOWN-GRADED FROM ORCHESTRAL TO SYNTHESIZER. If you have never seen the original Gumby episodes, then this, of course, will not be so irksome because THE ACTUAL VIDEO CONTENT OF THE EPISODES ARE THANKFULLY UNCORRUPTED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL RELEASE. Though changed, highly recommened for the uninitiated, great for your son or daughter or the kid in you!"
4,It's childhood all over again,"I'm a kid of the 80's, so I didn't watch Gumby when it was on Howdy Doody. I did see it in syndication in the 80's and 90's, however. I love this DVD...my favorite of the old cartoons on it is ""In the Dough."" Personally, I think anyone who doesn't like claymation is shortsighted...this technology was pioneering for its time, and has so much more heart than today's computerized cartoons."
2,Tells time fine BUT>>>,"Bought this watch in nyc, the sales person played up the 11 year warranty, about a month after the inlaid stone's fell out... Took it back, and was told that it would cost 28 dollars to fix cause that part of the watch wasnt covered... over all yeah it tells time fine but poor product over all and poor service. I supect that the company had problems with this watch because its not for sale anywhere anymore."
5,Where Else Can You Get A School Bus,"Our daughter is 2 and we have had this for several months. She LOVES school buses, so this was a perfect toy for her. She does not use it as ""blocks"" just as a toy bus to drive."
2,Not worth it.,The pieces don't stay together very well. My 3yr son got frustrated after a while and kept asking me to help him put them on. We ended up buy the Lego Duplo for him and he loves it.
3,Just okay,"This is an okay toy. My daughter loves blocks and car so we thought she would enjoy this, but in the end it was a little smaller then expected. When you can get a larger version for another store for 4.00 more, it really isn't worth it."
3,Good B-movie Fun,"This is not a great movie, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is capture some of the fun of a B-movie from the '50s and '60s. Thare are two passable performances, but mostly horrible acting. What makes the movie are Brett Piper's stop-motion spiders. If you get the DVD, I recommend only waching it with the commentary track on. It drowns out the bad, boring dialogue and the terrible acting and you learn a little about low-budget filmmaking."
1,Absolutely Pathetic,"This is the worst film I've ever had the misfortune of viewing, and this is coming from the guy who gave CHUPACABRA TERROR 5 stars. This film deserves -5 stars.Some bad CGI meteors knock a plane full of brain-dead college students out of the sky and causes it to crashland in the middle of nowhere. The dimwits inside leave and wind up in a little shack belonging to a crazy old farmer.Next thing you know, giant spiders start popping up every few minutes.The stopmotion used for the spiders looks to have been done by a four-year-old. The script appears to have been written by a six-year-old. The actors have the talent of a deaf chimp, and put about as much energy into their roles as a sloth.This film also rips-off many other better movies such as EVIL DEAD and ALIENS. The DVD transition is mediocore at best, but at least the special features include three trailers and a making-of featurette. But these aren't enough to make up for this beyond-horrible piece of cinematic trash."
1,Even Mike and the bots wouldn't know what to make of this,If you're looking for a movie that resembles the product of a really bad 1950's movie and a soft-core porn flick then this is the waste of celluoid for you! The only thing I've seen that even comes close to the level of unbelievable badness (and not in a good way; in a way that makes you want to track down and torture the producers) is Ice Queen. Not even Sci-Fi channel made-for-tv-movies are this god-awful.
2,Stinko-roonie!,"This movie was really bad! It's about huge killer spiders. The plot is tired and cliche, the characters are the same and the special effects are low budget. It's so badly made, it looks like a student film or something. It's hard to believe that people still make movies this horrible. The only reason I gave it an extra star is because it's so cheesy that parts of it are funny. Unless you are a big fan of bad b-horror movies this is not worth watching. Even the lesbian scene between the two hot girls is not enough to save the movie and they can't even play believable bimbos! This is good for a laugh or a 'bad movie' party but other than that I doubt I could find a reason to watch it again. It's not bad enough to be a 'so bad it's good' movie and not good enough to become a cult classic. It's not great as a scary movie either because it's way too laughable and fake looking to scare anyone!"
2,"If you like bad movies, you'll like Arachnia.",I recommend this movie for anyone thinking of getting into film making. It is SOOO encouraging. You know you can do better.Redeeming Factors: Rob Monkiewicz & the last 20 minutes (awesome)
4,D.DOYLE MINNEAPOLIS,I loved this book and read it in one night. Thats not surprising to anyone that knows me because I love Gunsmoke very much. I didnt like the fact that Mr. West refers to Matt Dillon as City Marshal I think it takes away from his character strength. And the fact Doc wasnt involved very much. I'm okay with the relationship Mr. West began with between Matt and Kitty because he had to start somewhere and explained it well in the first few chapters of the book. And all Gunsmoke fans completely understand and felt the love Matt and Kitty shared.
2,True Gunsmoke fans Beware,"Mr. West has written a good western, if he had not linked it withthe Gunsmoke T.V. Series. He has downgraded Matt Dillon From a U.S. Marshall to being a Simple Town Marshall of Dodge City with jurisdiction only within Dodge City limits and being tasked about stray dogs and other Trivial matters. Obviously Mr West is not familiar with GunSmoke and this offering is not on Parr with his other westerns."
1,"Book came in fine contition , buy the story and char's are......",The char's within this title are not anywhere close to what their tv counterparts are and how they speak .
2,Boots,"Advertised as a wide width but is too narrow around the toes, not comfortable for all day wear."
2,Boots...weakest link,"These boots fit like I expected, but the quality is poor...what can you expect for $40.00? The zipper isn't properly covered and so it snags socks and hosiery just horribly! The material is vinyl I think and looks rather cheap. But for the few times I use them each winter, they'll get me by for a couple years."
5,Best of the Day Trading books,"Clear straight forward explanation of day trading and what success requires.I found the strategies and over-all market insights very interesting and profitable.Particularly appreciated that the author was not selling anything(tapes,seminar,brokerage,etc.). Really a good and useful trading book---for a change!"
4,Focus Is THe Key To Enhance Bottom Line,"Abell explains the unique demands of day trading.He points out the role of focus in developing a profitable system and in adopting winning attitudes that foster calculated risk and discipline.His discussion is underscored by the interviews of top day traders.One complaint however,I would have preferred to see more technical analysis with more elaboration of momentum tehniques.The screen explanations were excellent.I really understand how they work now."
4,In all fairness,Having read all the day trading titles that are now on the market I would honestly have to say this is one of the best day trading books out there. Howard abell clearly understands trading and how the stock market operates. His analysis of trading tactics and methods as well as his distinction between money management and risk calculation is geared for the active online trader.About the Interviews----There is no other book out there that has interviews with day traders of this calibre!All in all an information packed book.
1,Nothing New Here,"This is a short book, consisting mostly of filler, and some of the poorest charts to support the points made that I have seen. Save your money, buy a less hyped but better written book."
1,0 STARS,"I don't know who wrote the other reviews, but i guess they were abell's relatives. This is the worst book ever. Two pages of real information. I learned absolutely nothing from this book. After reading lynch, o'neil , motley fool and many other great books; I am insulted by this book."
1,I'm returning my copy after one day!,After reading this book or at least reading to the point where the useless filler pages began I realize that I should have reviewed this board in the first place. Abell does a horrible job of explaining his charts and why the are important. He could have taken some time to use real life examples but he fails to do this. His KISS approach is so contradictory to his charts. Im an inexperienced trader but I feel I know nothing more than what I got from the interviews. Do not buy this book! It has a fancy cover and a lot of nothing. I have no reason to down this author other than I feel I was ripped out of plus shipping and handling.
4,Good Day Trading Boook,I have now read 4 of Howard's books and think they give a lot of useful information to traders. I recommend this one and The Electronic trading of Options. Day Trader's Advantage is also very good. I also like Murphy's and Schwager's books.
3,Excellent book but....,I have two complaints with Howard's book. 1)Why only give 3 interviews especially when these interviews are ten times better than the interviews in secrets of the electronic day traders.Should have offered more ideas from traders of this calibre!2)I would have liked to see more charts to illustrate the Digitral Day Trading approach. Other than that a great book which I definitely recommend.
2,"Hey Howard, WHERE'S THE BEEF????","Imagine going to your favourite burger place and getting a burger which has 1 ounce of meat and 10 ounces of condiments and bun. That is the feeling you will get when you read this book. What little material can be found is good, but you have to wade through a lot of blank pages, pages with 1 graph, pages with only the chapter heading, a lot of screen prints from Trade Cast (the guy even put in about 60 pages of the user manual, talk about ripping people off!!!!!) I returned my copy."
2,an entertaining read; but light on substance...,"A quarter of the book is devoted to an appendix that merely lists stocks, excerpts the Tradecast users manual and shows stock charts with no insight or analysis attached. Schwager's Market Wizards series are far better books on the psychology of trading. This author missed a great chance to really go into the mechanics and approaches to day/short term trading. He provides little insight into what works and what does not."
3,Where's the beef?,"The best parts of this book are the psychological considerations and the three interviews. However, Abell doesn't really give you a daytrading method. His charts and examples are either difficult to follow or contradictory. You will need to buy another book for actual daytrading tactics and for money management.I can't believe that Amazon doesn't show the table of contents so here it is: 1. The Day Trader's Advantage2. The Psychology of Successful Day Trading3. Strategy and the Overall Game Plan4. Competing with the Market Makers5.-7. Interviews with 3 daytraders8. Technical Considerations9. The Digital Day Trading ""Method""10. How Winning Traders ThinkAppendix A: Major Stocks Traded: Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500Appendix B: Electronic Trading Platform: TradeCast 3.0"
4,A lot of good information,Definitely worth a read.The information may be best suited to experienced traders. I found the ideas very tradeable.
1,One from the other side of the Planet,I know as little about day trading after reading this book as I did before. It didn't take long to read given its a small book made even smaller by being very repetitious.It's also grossly overpriced considering a large chunk is a manual for TradeCast.On the upside it does have some trading and money management advice which could be useful for longer term (position) trading.But as a technical guide to day trading forget it. If he knows how he can't communicate it; he needs an editor.
3,not bad if you skip the fluff,"This book seemed to be poorly organized. There was a lot of good information, however, you had to weed through the garbage, ( 50 pages of the Trade Cast users manual) charts should be near where you are talking about them rater than having to look for figures and matching up text to charts. There were a lot of pages of charts too. I think the publisher said it had to be a minimum of pages so that is what was done here. Good info on the good part though"
5,Well written and Intelligent,This book provides basic day trading information in three areas that should help almost any day trader notwithstanding his/her current level of experience.1-psychology and strategy of day trading.2-technical and chart analysis.3-making sense of and learning the specific functions on the Nasdaq level2 screen.The trader interviews are also interesting(the author provides charts that illustrate the discussed techniques).
4,Good Book But Not The Holy Grail,"Neither this book nor any trading book will make you a top trader.I've read this book three times and still feel I have a lot to learn.I've made a few trades that have been profitable.The key to winning trades is to find a system that works for you.Although there is no guarantted winning system here,it was still a good book."
1,"Nice book, Howard, but WAAAAAAAAAY too much padding","If you take out the 20 page stock symbol listing, the 60 page TradeCast user manual, the graphs, the 35 pages of interviews, the blank pages, the pages with only the chapter heading, you will have about a 25 page book. The material contained in those 25 pages or so is very good, but the fluff is very annoying. It looks as if the author was a bad boy and the teacher's punishment is for him to write a 250 page essay on day trading. A diarrhea of words backed up by a constipation of thought. Leave this PoS on the shelf."
2,not all its cracked up to be,I agree with a previous review. LOTS OF FLUFF!!! OK for the very beginner with extensive discussions about psychology. The final 100 pages (nearly) are a list of the NAS 100 and S&P 500 stocks and the users manual from TradeCast 3.0. Nearly 1/3 of the book is filler!!! A few good techniques but they could be better explained and the charts closer to the explainations.
5,Best Of The Day Trading Books,"Highly informative discussion of day trading techniques.I think this book will be most useful to serious traders and investors.Mr.Abell's writing style is infomed, engaging even stylish.An unqualified 5 star title."
4,Super Reader,"Gentleman, not.At least if you want to have the Sinister Six working for you, anyway.Castro has put together a pretty decent Spider-Man yarn here, from explaining the facts of lameness to a new bad-guy calling himself Disk Jockey who apparently is so oblivious, while living in Marvel New York, that he has no idea what superheroes or supervillains are.Neither Spider-Man or the retired newsagent he has to help out from this doofus can believe it.There are more serious problems though than the aforementioned character, not to mention the Sinister Six, a new member of whom may be linked to Spidey's past, or even related to him.Luckily getting away with their confrontation this time, the webslinger has a little help in the form of the raygun wielding SAFE agents.A few bits and pieces scattered throughout, some homages to other writers with 'an Oltion generator', an Askegren, etc., and a truly bizarre cameo in Wold-Newton style at the end.Oh, and Wolverine.3.5 out of 5"
4,"Powerful and Convenient, BUT....","Assist handle broke very easy and there is NO available replacement for it now. Motor is powerful and it is easy to use, but, without the assist handle, it stinks."
1,Piece of Sheiss,"Uh, this thing didn't last but two weeks when I had to tape together the bottom. Just normal use. The cheap price obviously was related to a run of these through the factory where the injection mold malfunctioned. QC picked it up and rather than take the tax loss they shipped them with the full knowledge that they would fail under normal use."
5,Love this machine!!!!,I simply love this machine! I have been so pleased with this weed eater. Like it MUCH better than the ones with the 18V batteries. I have used both and the internal battery charge lasts much longer. Love it!
3,3 Years - 2 Trimmers,"I really like this trimmer and one charge allows me to do my entire yard (trimming and edging) unless I let it go for a couple weeks. The first one was fine except the handle broke from normal use. Probably could have ordered a replacement, but decided to get another CST2000 so I could have a spare battery and trimmer. The second trimmer turns out to be junk. It might work or not, must be a connection or wiring issue. Since I now have 2 batteries I'm forced to order another trimmer."
4,Worth It's weight In Gold,"Finally a way to trim weeds without the hassle! I have a fairly big yard and I was able to trim the whole thing (along fences, flower beds, bushes and trees) on one battery charge.I love the AFS. I had a bump to feed in the past and could never get it to work! Not to mention the 3000ft extention cord that made trimming a mess! I also had gas trimmers and hated the smell! The only drawback with this trimmer is the weight. It's a little bit heavy and bulky. Other than that ...I really like it."
3,Better than a gas trimmer but battery life is short,"For years we had a gas trimmer which I just couldn't start. I decided to try a cordless model and I have to say I am a little disappointed. I have 2/3 of an acre and it only trims about half of the yard on a single charge. That means it takes me two days to edge the yard. Also the balance on the trimmer seems to be off for me. Instead of holding the handle, I end up holding the trimmer shaft in order to balance the unit when cutting. This may be because this unit was designed for taller men, not women to use. The automatic line feed has worked wonderfully for me. I have to say I love that part - I have had the unit for the entire mowing season and have never changed the cutting line or had to untangle it. That is quite a plus in my book. Without the automatic line feed I would have given this trimmer a much lower rating but that to me makes up for alot of other minor nuisances."
1,No Staying Power,"Manufacture says will trim 1/2 acre on single charge, but I can never completely complete the edging of my small front lawn and median on a single charge, much less do any triming. Also the plastic handle broke and have since had to jury rig a fix for it."
2,"Good, but could be better","The quality of the construction of this trimmer is very good. Black and Decker has a good reputation, but for (price), I think they need to go back to the drawing board with this one. The two issues I have are weight and power. 13 lbs may not seem like much, but after trimming my lawn for a few minutes, my arm nearly fell off. This thing is too heavy! Also, for a 12 volt cordless system, there is not enough power to trim efficiently. I frequently found myself going back and doing the same area due to the slow rotation of the trim line. I've had the Weed Eater for years and I'll think I'll get a new one of those. The B&D is going back."
1,"No Power, Short Battery Life","The box on the Black & Decker cordless trimmer says the battery will last for 1/2 an acre. This is a useless claim. Is that a 1/2 acre with no trees, fences, curbs, or sidewalks?They should instead tell you how many linear feet it can cut on one battery charge on average. But I suppose if they did this no one would buy it.I feel we have an average size lawn but this string trimmer could not do but half of it before it ran out of juice. To make matters worse it has so little power that it at times did not even have enough power to cut the grass. It would instead just ""whip"" the grass repeatedly until it fell limp against the ground. The Automatic Feed Spool has a blade that cuts the line if it gets to long. It rarely had enough power to cut it's own line.We attempted to use this string trimmer 3 times before we got frustrated and took it back. We now have the corded version of this same product. It is an excellent product."
4,Just enough performance... DO NOT LET BATTERY FREEZE,"This trimmer gives just enough performance. I have a small lot with the only power at the far end. I just do not like getting the 150' extension cord out to do the last bit of trimming on the lawn. With this trimmer I do not have to, so I trim more often. Now, ""She Who Must be Obeyed"" has other things to say about my work...The auto-feed function does not seem to work for me. (I have found that a silicone lube spray works wonders for this kind of thing) The battery and charger are fine. I never take the battery off of the trimmer.Do not leave this thing in the garage over the winter. These batteries will not take being frozen!!! I keep mine in the basement. These batteries can not be run down to zero and give good service life. Make sure you recharge the battery often and never run it down to zero."
1,Poor design-- plastic neck broke with light duty,"We have very light duty for this-- use it every other week for 10 min max. Unfortunately, it did not last more than 18 months before it design flaw was exposed: an all-plastic neck juncture that just cracked.Avoid this one!"
1,Battery dies and no go! SEE Follo-up,"We loved this trimmer. Lightweight, easy to manuever, no bumping or cutting to get line! Our yard is fairly small, so the charge was plenty to finish the job. HOWEVER, this - our third year - it was not holding a charge. I called B&D; - that's just what happens. WHAT? A new battery pack is about $30-35. A new corded model ST-4000 is about $35.00. They should make you aware that you will be either buying new batteries or replacing the unit every three-four years. OUCH!FOLLOW-UP: It appears it may have been a little cold in the garage for the battery. We got a new one, stored it in the basement instead and it has held up much better."
1,Waste of money,When i initially recieved this trimmer I really liked it. The versitility of a cordless edger/trimmer was great for doing the whole yard without the hassle of 'dragging a tail'. It's spooling feature of releasing more cord by tapping it on the ground also is a wonderful feature.However..I just bought this last May(2001) and already the battery is too weak to make it more than 40 feet around my yard(May 2002). This equates to a 4 day edging adventure to get the whole yard done since you must recharge the battery overnight. If I had to do it all over again I would go for a gas powered trimmer or one with a cord.Avoid this item.
2,Great Unit but it doesnt last,"We just burned up our third one of these, this one just slightly out of the warranty period. We love it, but we will be looking for something a little more durable..."
1,Sorry excuse for a weed trimmer,"This is the biggest piece of junk we've ever waster 80 dollars on. The string rarely feeds out on it's own, you have to constantly tip the unit up and manually pull the string out. The motor lacks sufficient rpm's to cut even modest weeds. The battery does not hold sufficient charge to do a resonably sized yard. It went in the trash can and we wrote the 80 bucks off as a learning expereience.We learned not to buy Black and Decker."
2,Cheap Plastic Parts,"The trimmer works for about 20-25 minutes before losing its charge, which is o.k. for me because I have a small yard. What isn't o.k. is that the plastic cap that holds the string in place is really thin and cheaply made. Mine broke after only one bump against a rock, and now I can't find a replacement part. I'd pay more for better construction, and ease of finding replacement parts."
3,Great but too heavy,"It does a great job but... I find that I can only handle it for a few minutes at a time. It is way too heavy for a woman unless she had been working out with weights. I have a very large yard with lots of plants. I would have done better buying one with a cord. The one I had, also B&D, was perfect even if I had to pull along the cords (100' total)."
1,Not for 1/2 acre..as advertised,"I have less than a 1/3 acre lot, so I figured this should be adequate since the box says for up to 1/2 acre. The goods: well built, string feed seems to work well. No need for power cord, gas. No battery memory (claimed) Quiet, no exhaust. The bad: I'm 6 feet tall and find the handling real ackward. The battery last less than 15 min on a full charge. I do light trimming and edging and I find that I can only do 1/3 of my 9000 square feet lawn with each charge. A two hour recharge bought me another 5-7 minutes. The narrow 12"" cutting path exacerbates the problem since sometimes I have to make 2 passes to finish the job. There is not enough power to cut tall (6"" or more) grass. I returned mine and bought a gas powered, which I'm much happier with. If you live in an arid area where grass never gets real tall, and your lot is very small, this may be perfect. The reason for 1 star is that it is not appropriate for lot size anywhere near 1/2 acre as stated right on the box."
1,Piece of crap,I owned this Grass Hog for about 6 months. I had nothing but problems with it. The battery was so hard to remove from the shaft of the Grass Hog. It almost took me the same amount of time trying to remove the rechargable battery then it did to trim the lawn. After 6 months the battery would no longer charge. What a piece of crap.
3,"Doesn't cut St.Augustine grass well or edge well, Why???????","I have tried mine two times. Tomorrow the 3rd. Observed that there is not enough power to cut thru the St.Augustine Flortam grass I have in Florida, that resembles crab grass up north. I wonder if it is the line. Is it too thin or not dense enough? Before the auto feed puts out a new edge you are using a woren down edge and too short to be effective. Black and Decker is sending me a sample of line as I feel the .065 that came with the unit is not really that size. I can't believe they put that thin a line in the machine. I matched my units line with bulk in Home Depot and the stock line looks thicker. Any similar problems e-mail me at clarkjudy@hitter.net as I an considering taking mine back for a Ryobi 155R 12-volt cordless, if I can find one in stock somewhere."
2,"Works great-workmanship sucks, keep your receipt!","Unfortunately, I was one of the buyers that did not keep my receipt or I would have returned it after one use. I have no complaints about the cutting ability. The shaft cracked after the first use when trying to remove the battery for recharge. The battery was very difficult to remove, the top was very top heavy. I love using battery power for convenience, noise and pollution friendliness. My lawn mover is battery and I love it."
2,"Works great-workmanship not so great, keep your receipt!","Unfortunately, I was one of the buyers that did not keep my receipt or I would have returned it after one use. I have no complaints about the cutting ability. The shaft cracked after the first use when trying to remove the battery for recharge. The battery was very difficult to remove, the top was very top heavy. I love using battery power for convenience, noise and pollution friendliness. My lawn mover is battery and I love it."
4,Would be Great if Autofeed Worked,"I am using this now for the second season. The battery still charges well. I was concerned it wouldn't work after sitting all winter, but it was fine (I left it on the charger all winter.) I use it for a small lawn that takes only about 10 minutes to trim. It is very convenient, quiet, heavy but well-balanced. The only problem is that the autofeed does not work. I have to take the spool off and unwind the string manually. A major nuisance! If not for this problem I would have rated it 5 stars."
4,Great Trimmer except for the line feed,"This trimmer is fantastic if you cut your grass just as it's drying. If you try to cut green grass, the battery fades before it's supposed to.However, the line feed on my unit doesn't work correctly, which may be why the cutting time isn't what it's supposed to be (the line only feeds about half way out to the shield, which means I'm getting much less cutting action than I should be).I recommend everything about this trimmer, except for the ""automatic"" line feed...."
3,Love the autofeed... when it works,"Black & Decker has always had yard tools with great features; unfortunately at the expense of quality. This was my second trimmer from B&D, and neither of them lasted me two seasons. They're always great when I first get them, easy and comforatable to use, but they tend fall apart quickly - the guards wouldn't stay on either of them - and the performance of the autofeed degrades until it just won't work anymore. Alas, it's back to the bump-feed for me, cause I know I won't have to buy another one for at least 3 years."
2,"Great cut, not enough battery!","The Black and Decker CST 2000 Grass Hog is easy to use, is light, and cuts great. However, the maximum amount of cutting time per use was only about 20 minutes. The company advertises up to 40 minutes, but after 20 minutes the power decreased to about half, and the trimmer could not cut a blade of grass. For a small yard, where 20 minutes is all you need, this would be an ideal product."
1,Not a good choice if you have a real yard,"We bought this trimmer at a home improvement store (Home Depot/Lowes/etc) because of high praise from the Black&Decker rep who was working there. I'm sad to say that it failed in practically every aspect -- the charge ran out much too quickly, it didn't have enough power to do a decent job when it was charged up, the auto-feed didn't work well for us at all... I guess the only good thing about it was that it was light-weight and quiet. We returned it after several attempts to get accustomed to it and bought a real product."
1,A big disappointment...,"I own a number of black and decker rechargeable tools and have been satisfied. I purchased this trimmer and was so disappointed! The power was POOR and didn't last very long even with a freshly charged battery. It was like when I just touched grass with it, the speed slowed and it really didn't cut the grass. I'm sorry I threw out the box because I'd love to take it back!!!! Boo Black and Decker! You can do so much better than this!"
2,"Hurts your hands, battery doesn't last long","I don't like the B&D Grass Hog. It is uncomfortable to use, especially if you have arthritis in your hands, because you can't lock the power switch into the ""on"" position. You have to grip the lower switch with your 2nd through 5th fingers while simultaneously exerting heavy pressure on the upper switch with your thumb. After 10 minutes of this, I get serious pain in my hand and the muscles in my wrist. (I have the same problem with a B&D electric saw.) The battery doesn't last long, runs out after 15 to 20 minutes. The trimmer doesn't work well with tall grass. There are only two advantages: the trimmer has an automatic feed, no bumping needed, and it's electric, so you don't have to store cans of gasoline in your basement. But all in all, it's easier (and cheaper) to trim grass and weeds the old-fashioned way, using hand clippers."
4,Keep Your Receipt,"It's convenient, not that heavy and doesn't pollute. Perfect for the smaller yard. Keep your receipt, however, so you can be sure your warranty is valid. The last Black & Decker trimmer I had, the cylinder holding the timming line broke off the drive and could not be repaired. I didn't have a slip, and even though it was still under warranty, I had to trash it and buy a new one."
1,Short but sweet,"The biggest drawback is the charge only lasts 25 to 30 minutes! The auto line feeder is great, it is nice not to have a cord or have to mix gas and oil, it is balanced well and lightweight, works well at cutting back weeds but the charge doesn't last very long. I wouldn't recommend it if you have a large area to cut weeds in. For small yards it is fine. It takes a long time to recharge also, at least 6 hours and they recommend 12 hours. I have used it about 6 times and each time I charged it overnight and it still only lasted 25 to 30 minutes."
2,OK,Good for very small jobs but doesn't have the power to cut through anything big. My auto-feed also stopped working after about a year and I finally ended up burning out the motor. If you do more than minor trimming you may end up having to buy a new one in a couple of years.
3,Beware of battery charger,"I have a B & D cordless moewer, cordless hedge trimmer and other power tools. They all have worked to my expectations.. EXCEPT the GRASS HOG'S battery charger. The trimmer seems to be fine.. but the charger doesn't work properly. The problem is not the battery, but the charger itself. I can't seem to find anyone who carries the charger in the Georgetown, Tx. area. I can't even get Home Depot to replace the charger. I would like to know a good brand name cordless trimmer/edger that is more reliable."
1,Overhyped & Underdelivers,"What a major disappointment this baby is. I got about half way done with my 1/2 acre yard before running out of juice. I could have put up with the fact that this guy is heavy & you have to wait 24 hours to charge it up again if it can't finish the job, but it didn't cut very well either. This could have been a great product. The automatic line feeder works great. When someone comes up with a unit that has auto line feed, works well and gives you freedom from an extension cord, I'll buy it. This unit is not it. The cheaper electric unit works much better at half the price."
1,It's going back to the store!,"I need something that last more then 15 minutes. Black & Decker, you have let me down!"
1,"Whap, whap, whap, ouch!","I am glad to hear some people are have positive experiences with their units. As for mine, there is a serious problem with the line feed and string cutter. I have been hit three times in the leg with excessive string that was feed out and then finally broke off. The piece then flew back and hit me in the right leg. B&D sent me a new guard and cutter, but same old problem. I did a quick web search found that I was not the only one who had the feed and cutting problem, although I was the only one to mention taking a hit on the leg. This problem concerned me enought to email the Consumers Product Safety Commision. So, I will be trying to return this model."
4,"Good for the very interested people, but not for all","Are you obssesed with typography? Do you have a good library for your personal typographic needs? Do you have an adiction for the very specific typography? I recommend this book only for the people that have the courage (and the money) to read more about typography. If you are a student, or a beginner in professional affairs, I doubt you need this book. For the others... what are you waiting for? I think strongly that if you really focus in the essence of each chapter you will understand more (but only a little more) of this small but important matter that is the space on typography."
4,This book deserves to be reprinted!,"I discovered the latest edition iof Finer Points in the Spacing and Arrangement of Type, and was impressed by the value it offered--especially since it sells new for a small percentage of the high cost of the original hardcover edition.Although the rules of setting easy-to-read type have been known for centuries, sometimes the most inspirational writing is to be found in books that are considered inter-generational ""classics.""Geoffrey Dowding's Finer Points in the Spacing and Arrangement of Type provides an excellent and highly accessible review of the basics of text alignment and spacing. Its warmth and style drives home information you may already be familiar with, but never really ""noticed.""This book is one of those ""gems"" that puts newer, more clinical, books to shame."
5,Try the Authors newer book,"So You Thought You Couldn't Draw?: Zero to Artist: 30 Minutes for 30 Days (30 Minute Art Series)I used Sandra Angelo's updated book, So you thought you couldn't draw? , (search under Author),and have had great success. I was drawing stick figures and now I can draw ! I have looked at other beginningdrawing books, and this was the easiest. You can't go wrong with this book."
3,True but Difficult,"I have Had This book for over 5 months and yet have seen no improvment in my drawing.I cant even draw a straight line, and this book didnt help with my crooked line.What im saying is that this book is more for people who have some drawing skills.I recommend a real live tutor.visuals are better than words"
1,Be wary of buying these products,"My 73 year old mother called the phone number listed on Ms. Angelo's website to order a product after having troubles with Ms. Angelo's poorly-designed on-line order form. The person who answered the phone SCREAMED at her ""Do you know it's 8:00 a.m. in San Diego? Call back later"". Obviously, Ms. Angelo has issues she needs to resolve, and should consider whether or not she is suited to be in a public service business."
5,This stuff is great!!!,"I have used lots of cleaners in the past, but this one is the best so far. I can leave my wedding set in the jar overnight, and the next morning, the diamonds look like new. My husband will even drop his ring in the cleaner to shine his wedding band.I would recommend this product to anyone."
2,not so great,"I was not satisfied with this product at all.I used a product before that only required putting the jewelry in the solution for 15-30 minutes and it came out radiant. With this product, I left my ring in overnight, had to scrub it with a toothbrush, and there were still traces of ""build up"" in some of the crevices of my ring.It was way too expensive for the less than satisfactory results I received. I also emailed the company to let them know I was dissatisfied and asked for a refund (since they say they have a money back guarantee) but never received a reply.I was also annoyed it was around $5.00 for shipping but all I got was an empty plastic container, a ""refill"" packet, and directions on how to make the cleaning solution.If you want this product, just get the refill packet instead of the whole thing."
2,"OK at best, but worth it if the price is low","Pretty good show. Lacks the energy and enthusiasm of the band's Slane, Ireland DVD. Indoor venue's sound quality and lighting are not as good either. I was literally moved by the Slane show. Bryan's got an amazing voice when he vocalizes with passion and that seems to be somewhat absent at the Budokan show. Buy it for your collection if your a fan, but if you must chose buy the awesome Slane Castle DVD instead!"
4,Worth the price,I have been using this now for several months. It is well made. and protects my Ipod well. I recommend it.
5,Perfect application for professionals!,"I've read ""The Explosive Child"" for parents, providers, etc. I enjoyed it; however, this book provided the perspective of a provider in such a concise way that I was able to immediately begin applying it as I read. It is a great way to reaffirm the professional's role."
2,Too Technical to be Helpful,"In my line of work as a behavior consultant, I read A LOT of research journals. However, this dry book was much harder to plow through and so I gave up and ordered a different book! For a parent or professional who is trying to help an especially difficult child, this is just NOT a user-friendly book.Here's the book that I bought and found very helpful: Survival Strategies for Parenting Your ADD Child: Dealing with Obsessions, Compulsions, Depression, Explosive Behavior, and Rage. It's by George T. Lynn.Survival Strategies for Parenting Your ADD Child: Dealing with Obsessions, Compulsions, Depression, Explosive Behavior, and Rage"
1,Go see him speak!,"This book was very ""wordy"". I did however get to see him speak and he was great! Just wish he spent A LOT more time on non-verbal children!"
3,Ok,"Never as Good as the first time is the story of Jake, a playboy who's still in love with his ex-wife Indigo. Jake starts dating Kayra, but it don't works out because of his playing ways. Kayra end's up falling for her bestfriend Pam, who's always had a crush on Kayra. Pam end's up getting all of them in some serious trouble."
5,Awesome imagination development book!,"This book is fantastic. It has nearly no words, but has countless stories told in pictures through its beautiful illustrations. There are also seek and find features like a tiny mouse hidden on every page.We were given a copy for my Son's 2nd birthday and after the 3rd night of my wife and I hunting through it ourselves while he was asleep, we decided to buy 5 copies as gifts for all of our friends with small children. Do yourself and your kids a favor and buy this book!"
5,Amazing,"This book is creative, beautiful, loving and compassionate! It demonstrates how a kind, open and loving approach to life can change everything! A must own for every classroom and home!"
3,"5 stars for content, 3 for sender","Was not as described. I had to clean the cover from what seemed like food. The interior was very good.NOTE: this is a picture book. The detail is insane so will be very very difficult to use by teachers as a group reading book. However, do NOT UNDERESTIMATE the use of such a book for aspect of literacy/writing - summary,observation, prediction, etc, etc. Could be used for object identification for ESL/ELLs.ALSO: Please look at other books by this author!!"
4,Not quite the same as it used to be,"I have been using this cream for many years, but the store stopped carrying it. I really love it, I have very, very dry skin and it works well. I recently ordered this and was a little disappointed because it was much runnier than I remember. I'm not sure if it is being made differently or if it broke down a little during shipping. Maybe it got too hot, I don't know, but I will try again, maybe I'll get it from a different purveyor."
5,great value :),"I've been using this as a inexpensive alternative to belly butter and it has been working great. Like most milk based creams/lotions it is a little difficult to rub in but once it is on it stays on all day and keeps my skin well moisturized/nourished. The fragrance is very mild and pleasant. They could probably get away with selling this for a lot more... but lucky for us they keep it honest. ;)***UPDATE*** My son is 16 months old now and I think usage of this cream is the reason why I escaped without a single stretch mark. Stretch marks are very hereditary in my family so I was concerned early on about doing what I could to prevent them. I didn't have any until towards the end of my pregnancy, then I got a few small red marks which disappeared after I gave birth and continued to use this cream. I will definitely be using it in the future for the same purpose if it's still around by then! :)"
2,Not like it used to be,To me it smells like play doh .... It's a bit runny (watery) when its suppose to be cream... Wouldn't recommend it....
4,Teacher and Engineer,"Regarding to its price, it is worthy for the college student. The explaination is very easy to understand."
4,Review for IT enabled Strategic Management,An excellent book for a good review of IT relating with strategic management

5,I work for Peanuts,"Another appealing mystery by Doug Cushman. My grandchildren love the way he gives clues in his illustrations. The humor is there for children and adults alike. Fun to read, and a good bedtime story."
2,Overrated CD from overrated blues artist,"Eric Clapton plays some nice leads on this CD. I wish he was doing the vocals. I don't know where John Mayall ever got the idea that he could sing. It wasn't from me. I was playing his music in a blues/rock band all the back in 1969, and I have always wanted to say that. There......I've said it!"
5,a masterpiece,"For those of you who really want to hear the early works of Eric Clapton, than this is the album to purchase. ""All Your Love I Miss Loving"" is a classic which helped catapult this guitarist into rock-god status. This ablbum will help listeners understand the driving force behind clapton - blues."
5,Best guitar solo ever,"Despite Mayall's tortured singing, there is a lot of great stuff on this album, but ""Stepping Out"" is in a class by itself. An instrumental (and therefore not marred by Mayall's vocals), it is simply one of the most brilliantly conceived and executed electric guitar solos ever recorded. Period. If Clapton had never played another note, this recording of ""Stepping Out"" alone would have established him as one of the all-time greats. After listening to this track for more than 40 years, I still get a chill every time I crank it up on my stereo."
5,"Eric Clapton's "" God Like"" Begginings!","The ultimate testament to the power of the British blues! A beautiful all time classic, with the sizzling Les Paul through a Marshall combo work of Eric Clapton. It is easy to see how he earned the nickname god around this time.An emotional, lyrical masterpiece and a wonderful effort by all involved. May be the best of John Mayall's many great bands. A treasure trove of guitar gold and blues classics!"
4,nostalgia,"I saw this band live several times during the period when this album was made. At one point Mayall had Jack Bruce on Bass, which meant he had one third of what became Cream! Listening to this reissue on CD format brought back memories.It helps as a previous reviewer has implied to hear it as ""London"" blues. rather than comparing it to American black music."
4,A must for blues freaks,Anyone who loves still the blues and wants to either listen or play the blues must hear this CD. Eric at his early days with the dirtymarshall sound of his stratocaster and John Mayall on piano trying to make the sound sweeter.Some of the classic tunes are recorded here for the first time. And should'nt listen to the sound from these days but from the old days.
5,Somethings Are Better Not Remastered,"This is an extraordinary album, and a seminal one for many people getting into blues in the '60's. I have had this in one form or another since the week it originally came out on vinyl in Mono in the US. Interestingly (at least to me) , it is one of the few albums that I prefer in MONO untouched by either the artifice of being made into stereo or the ingenuity of digital re-mastering. Not to say that it is not exemplary in those formats, but the raw power projected by the original Mono release is something else again. However you own it, you'll enjoy it and you'll own a piece of music history."
4,I haven't used it yet.,I'm sure it will be just fit an be work jist fine when I use it.I have yet to install the heater.
4,"Vico C: the ""filósofo"" lives!!!","Vico C is back at it again. With the release of his live album, he once more demonstrates why he is still one of the best latin rap artists. Songs like Cosa Nuestra de Barrio and Base y Fundamento shows how involved the audience was in this concert. He demonstrates the control of his voice projection and artistic abilities is in the mix EL FILOSOFO where he sings songs that made him famous when he was an underground artist. To finish it all off there is a bonus track (El Superheroe) from his upcoming album where we can see the maturity he has obtained. Overall the sound recording quality is excellent and the beats are fair. It is a must have for all those latin rap artist fans."
5,Best collection yet!,"I've always enjoyed Vico C's style since his very first track, ""La Recta Final."" However, I never knew that he was such a great performer on stage. Well, this CD demonstrates just that. With some of his best songs ever, (and a few new ones) Vico C electrifies with his unique style. Many of his songs are played to different rythms, which is a welcomed change. Then there is an added bonus with his newest song, ""El Super Heroe Vivo."" His maturity as a rap artist is displayed brilliantly on this track. Vico C fans, you'll love it! Que triste que ultimamente ha caido en problemas de nuevo. Oremos por el todos los fans cristianos. Que Dios nos libre todos de las tinieblas."
4,Lovely artwork combined with traditional messages,"I had to see this deck displayed before I was interested in it, and I am primarily interested based on the fine art work. It is fun to see the fairy folk in this ""Tarot of the Hidden Folk,"" caught in this artist's lovely illustrations. A basic interpretation guide is included - just 1-2 sentences per card. I keep it at our summer cabin, purely for fun and for exploration with the children and grandchildren, who find these whimsical images - and the futures anyone can dream of - precisely what they need before dropping off for bed. It certainly beats TV - and the internet. Besides, it has, as every Tarot deck has, its own set of moral lessons, for those who would like to heed them."
1,Inadequate 4 line cordless phone,The phone only works with the RCA base unit (25414RE3 or 25415RE3) and both phones (base and cordless) can't be used at the same time. It is an either/or situation. Also the cordless handset can only pick up calls put on hold on the base they are attached to and not other 25414RE3 or 25415RE3 phones.I do not recommend this 4 line cordless phone even though it is very reasonably priced.
4,Too Cute,It's a nice story. I like the two leads as a couple--Gleendylis Inoa and E.J. Bonilla. They really made it work.
4,forbidden love story,"I loved this movie because it is during the time of 9/11. It makes you realize the reality of the families affected, the work it took, health conditions. It also makes you see how difficult it was to maintain the love relationship between the two teens. It touches on domestic violence, growing up in a poor neighborhood and many other interesting real.life situations."
3,well done,"I fell upon this movie and wasn't so interested in watching a young relationship. But the 9/11 element pulled me in, since I'm a New Yorker. I found all the actors extremely real and although the director is taking a more lighthearted approach to this sensitive subject, the bits & pieces regarding 9/11 infused in this film hit me like a brick. Its' strong emotional images mixed with teenagers in love makes for an interesting balance. But the sweet ending left me feeling complete, grasping the director's message that LOVE is what did and what continues to get New Yorkers through post 9/11."
3,pink?,"the pink isn't really pink at all! It's more like an almond color.Not super comfy, but if it was actually pink i could've lived with it...oh well"
2,I was hoping for full color pictures,To much reading for me. Basically an encyclopedia of information on cruises... information overload for just one trip!
3,It doesn't do her/them justice.,"I don't think this video did a good job of portraying how good they are in concert. If you ever get a chance to see them, don't miss it! The way her voice fills an auditorium is amazing. [Note: I've only seen them once.]"
3,Why No Center Channel,"Why did Rounder omit the center channel. This is the best performance I have ever seen, (so was the AKUS concert at George Mason University!) BUT, I am very disapointed that the center channel was not used. Why? I called Rounder, I e-mailed them too and have not heard from them even though I was promised an answer. Is mine defective? Either many reviewers do not know what a center channel is or my copy is defective. I would love to hear from Rounder to solve this riddle."
4,Alison Krauss & Union Station Live,I doesn't get much better than this. This is not just Alison Krause show. Each member of the band is featured and these are great musicians. The dobro wows you on the 2nd number of concert and things just keep getting better. All of the bands standards are here and very well done. This is money and time well spent. If you have home theater even better.
5,Alison Krauss & Union Station,This is Alison and the group at its best. If you like country music you will realy like this two volume set.
3,not true blue,"saddened by lack of original bluegrass & gospel songs still enjoyed her performance though, quality of sound not the best bill"
4,The real Alison Krauss,"I bought this because I was interested in Alison's personality almost as much as her sound, and now I know her better with this concert DVD. Technically speaking, this live taping is not perfect (the only reason for not giving 5 stars). I find the interviews almost as interesting as the concert itself.If you like Alison, you'll want this DVD."
2,Artistically beautiful - technically terrible,"This is a beautiful performance by a great artist that is ruined, for me, by two puzzling technical defects. First, as another reviewer has noted, there is no center channel sound in either Dolby or DTS. What's the point of providing multi-channel sound if the critical center channel is ignored. Second, the picture on my standard aspect ratio tv is not wide-screen as the disc advertises but some sort of ""squished"" full screen. It's as if the DVD was intended only for wide screen sets. Alison Krauss deserves better production than this from Rounder."
1,The worst dvd I have ever heard,"This dvd is such a disappointment, she is a good singer, beautiful voice, but, the sound quality of this dvd, is horrible, she talks so low you can not hear her and some of her words, you cannot understand. I would most definitley recommend no-one to buy this dvd, unless theY re-do the audio!"
3,Great Concert - Poor Sound,I'd love to give this concert 5 stars. The playing is wonderful - Alison the band are stunning musicians and the material chosen for this concert tour was first rate.Although this DVD is advertised as 5.1 in DTS and Dolby it isn't. There is no center channel used and the vocals are mixed into the right front speaker with some of the instruments. The result is muddy vocals that are almost lost in the mix.I did pick this concert up in SACD surround and the engineers did it right there. The sound on the SACD is very good. For some reason they screwed up the DVD - too bad.
5,Alison Has a New Fan,"I saw this same presentation on HD Net and was floored by this incredible talent. Later I found the concert was on DVD (received a Grammy for best live concert, you will hear why) and got it. I'm not a big fan of live concert recordings, but this one was different. It is so good, I use it now as a system demo. One curiosity in this recording is that there is no center front channel in Dolby 5.1 (so it is Dolby 4.1 really) or DTS (either soundtrack is selectable), but I think this is an advantage. Spatial relationships are maintained between the two front mains and the rears provide the auditorium ambience. Audio and video are spotless."
4,Alison Krauss & Union Station Live,"Great DVD. My only criticism is that the introduction of the band, especially the bass player is too drawn out."
3,Fair for the money,I thought this would be a little more instructional. It is mostly just a video of children doing gymnastics.My granddaughter who is 7 liked it. The 11 year old thought it was for babies.
4,Skill Review,"I was looking into purchasing a video that would help me teach my daughter how to practice what she was learning in class at home. I reviewed several of the videos before choosing this one. It is for the beginner gymnast and do not recommend it to any gymnast in level 3 or beyond, but for my level 2 gymnast it was helpful. She reviews many skills for preschoolers, as well as for 5 & 6 years olds. We found the progression of skills to be very helpful, particularly for the floor exercises. It is difficult to do many of the exercises unless you have all the equipment in your home. We don't. We have since purchased a mat, but used those letter cubes that were for my younger children to give my 6 year old a better surface to practice on.Overall I think this DVD is expensive for what it offers, but am happy with the purchase and level of activities.This would also be ideal for a gymnastic coach looking to working with young children, as it really breaks down all the skills."
4,I cannot wait for the next one,"I just finished ""Rising Tides"" and can't wait for ""Inner Harbor"". This book is even better then ""Sea Swept"" and I don't think I can make it until January for the outcome of it all. I am sure I will be reading this one more then once."
3,"Typical Nora Roberts, entertaining.","I really like this series, I read the second book immediately on release. (Sorry Amazon, I couldn't wait for your database update!) Ethan is more likeable than Cam in Sea Swept, must be that strong, silent type thing. I really liked Grace, she is very much a normal, just-like-you-and-me character. Seth is coming right along, much more quickly and simply than he would in real life, I think. Entertaining, a fast read, not as good as the ""Born in.."" series, but I still recommend it for Nora Roberts fans."
4,Good Book.,"I loved the relationships in this novel. Between the brothers, between Ethan and Grace and especially between Ethan and Seth. It was a much deeper story than ""Sea Swept"". I only had one problem, Anna totally got on my nerves. She becomes part of the family and suddenly she wants to boss everyone around! I think Grace was a much stronger female character and her relationship with Ethan is a lot more believable than Anna and Cam's. I think because the whole thing with Anna and Cam in ""Sea Swept"" was so totally shallow, there really wasn't much to them in ""Rising Tides"". On the other hand you can see Ethan and Grace having what it takes to make their marriage last a lifetime."
4,4 1/2 stars....Better than the first..,"I'm not unbiased since I'll buy any book with Nora Robert's name on the cover. I enjoyed Ethan's story more than Cam's....Ethan had endured crimes against himself as a child that made him believe he's not worthy of love, a family, children as an adult. At the same time he's pulled by a younger brother who needs him, his father's suspicious death, a new and old business and the woman he's wanted for years. This is a man who could have been destroyed by his past, and he's certainly been deeply wounded, but he has survived, stronger, perhaps kinder, certainly more introspective, because of it. His insecurities reminded me of Eve Dallas in the J.D.Robb series. Nora Robert's just gets better and better."
4,Better than the first; couldn't put it down,"I plodded through the first book, but I could not put Ethan's story down! I had it in the car, inbetween chores...everywhere! Ethan was so likeable, and I thought he and Grace were so cute together. Can't wait to read the other two; just picked them up from the library yesterday."
3,Not as good as the first book in the Quinn Brother's series.,"I enjoyed Rising Tides, which is the second book in Nora Robert's Quinn Brother's Trilogy. However, I didn't get into the character of Ethan like I did with the character of Cam in Sea Swept. Ms. Roberts continued with the ""mystery"" of who Seth really is, and showed how he was slowly learning to trust all of them. Can't wait for the third and final book."
2,Rising nothing!,"Am I the only one who thought this story was contrived. It appeared to me that though Ethan has been in love with Grace for ten years, he decides (or she does!) to tell her about it when Nora Roberts decides to write a story? It was a forced story. Since there were three brothers, there had to be three maidens, however strange it may seem. I think Roberts needs to concentrate on writing stories and not series. The characters in this book seemed to be doing things to please the writer than themselves. I have always believed that characters come alive once you start writing, but not in this one. They stayed buried and to think I hunted for this book when I was in Europe. I was disappointed!"
1,Sounded like a Harlequin romance novel.,I was expecting to hear something like James Michener's Cheasapeake novel. I was disappointed. The story sounded more like a Harlequin romance novel.
5,Excellent,"This book is every bit as good as the first in the series! Nora Roberts has a way with words that is incredible! When she describes a scene, you can almost hear the sounds of the bay and smell the flowers. The story is touching and very true to life. I can't wait until the third book comes out."
4,Memorable characters with intelligent dialog,"engrossing novel with interesting characters. Much more to this novel than meets the eye, superb twists and plot!"
4,Ms. Roberts is the same as ever....GREAT!!!!,"Rising Tides is even better than Sea Swept. I don't think that I can wait until January for Inner Harbor. The best thing about this series is the relationships between the brothers. In both books that I have read so far, there is no question that the 3 brothers will do exactly as their father wanted and protect Seth at the same time. That is the most wonderful thing about Ms Roberts...her insight into human nature and her feel for relationships and family."
4,"Sue""s review",This was part of a great triology by Nora Roberts. I recommended it to my sister and mother and they also enjoyed the read.
5,Rising Tides,Rising Tides was very good. It continues the Chesapeake bay saga. Good story line and very well written. Love Nora Roberts
5,Great characters,"Nora Roberts at her best. The characters are strong, descriptions great and the love is wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,Hot,"If you ever thought about doing an ultra but weren't quite sure, this movie will convince you either way. It comes as close as a DVD can to putting you out in Death Valley and letting you go. It's probably closer than many people want to get to the edge: raw, fascinating, and exciting. Don't make the mistake I did of lending it to a friend, you'll never get it back. A great movie."
4,Inspiring,This movie is a 'must see' for those who aim complete the Badwater some day!It is inspiring because you see that sometimes the tough-hero type of guy is not the one who reaches its goals. Rather you see a well humored old sir in his sixties or a humble material-poor and spiritual-rich lady crossing the finish line!
5,Stunning,"This movie is stunning and powerful. At points, it is raw-- as you watch these runners that may be very prepared but still may not finish such an amazing feat... it reminds you of life... not just running.This is one of the best running movies in existence today."
4,Impressive,"This movie shows many, if not all, aspects of running an extreme ultra race as Badwater. I found it both inspiring and frightning as the runners experienced different stages of physical and mental endurance. Although I never(?) intend to participate in Badwater, it inspired me tremendously to see ""normal people"" being able to finish this extreme race."
1,Not what I expected. CHEAP,"The sterling silver was really cheap and danty, the backs could easily bend and break off. I would recommend that you spend your money else where."
5,Super satisfied,"These guys are great, Awesome is the word. Received my product in good time. and very pleased with it. Had a little problem with one of the earrings and they replaced them. Awesome Will be shopping with them again. Most defiantly.Dewayne"
5,Great Item,I have a wonderful parallel Bible that I love to use for Bible studies and Sunday School lessons. The only problem is that there was not a concordance in the back. This concordance is amazing. It has so many different listings and is very detailed. It is small enough to carry around with my Bible (hint: pocket). I have only had it for about a week so far but I have used it so much already. This is a great tool for those who don't have a concordance.
4,Austi Road Atlas,"If Traveling to Australia this book is great for getting around the country and finding locations to visit, its very detail"
5,Very Good book,"No matter what anyone says... read it and make your own decision. For me, this was one of the best books that I have ever read. I could not put it down. I work in a library and read a lot. This is one of those books that I would highly recommend.I laughed outloud and I cried. It brought back memories and shed light on things shadowed by sometimes not so clear views of media.I love both Martin and Lewis and I was overjoyed to have a story of their relationship. I feel that Jerry did an exceptional job of relaying their relationship to the readers. The book made me feel that he cared and still cares deeply for Dean. This book is an excellent tribute to that. So much so that I am reading it twice."
4,"A fascinating history of a ""golden age...""","Although I was a youngster, I clearly remember the excitement in our household in anticipation of Martin & Lewis performing on the Colgate Comedy Hour. This book, candidly and lovingly written by Jerry Lewis, explores the highs and lows of the most famous comedy team in America. The story of their ""debut"" in Atlantic City is hilarious. If you have an interest in great show business tales, don't hesitate to get this book. A fast, fun read."
1,Not very good,"This book is all about Jerry Lewis. If you've ever read anything about Dean Martin, you know he didn't like Jerry."
2,Dean & Me,"Dean and Me: (A Love Story)I found this to be a little dis-heartening. I love Dean Martin and from an interview I heard with Jerry Lewis, I felt he cared about him too. It wasn't what I expected. I honestly haven't finished the book. More about Jerry than Dean. I wish he were alive to comment on it."
5,Dean and Jerry,"I thank Jerry Lewis for the honesty and spirit he shares with us. If you want to feelwhat it is like when magic happens, this story lets you. A really fun, and enlightening read."
2,Not Forthcoming,"While Jerry Lewis, rather late in life, professes his great love for Dean Martin, there is not much depth to his discussions involving his relationship with him. While Lewis makes abundantly clear what a handsome man Dean was, and what an extraordinatry talent, it comes too late, and perhaps too little. The show business anecdotes are interesting, but often are only a cursory overview described in Hallmark generic terms, rather than with real dialogue, and mentioning all the names of the players. Lewis' solipsistic leanings sometimes creep into the retrospective take. I was particularly struck by Lewis' pittying response to Dean's dining alone at La Famiglia. The book is better desinged for a two-part magazine article. Lewis could have given us so much more."
5,Excellent and Insightful,"I agree with the vast majority of reviewers here: This is the inside scoop we've been waiting for. Jerry Lewis can thoughtfully reflect on the team's 10 years together and put things in perspective for us. The audiobook version is excellent also, because it is read by a reader who can approximate the sound of these great performers: Jerry in a six-year-old voice and Dean with this distinctive smooth tone. There I was, sitting in the driveway again, waiting for a place to stop so I could go inside my home. It's that good."
4,excelent boock,"this book is excelent told the history of two big persons, like all the clown they have their diferences....just amazing"
5,FABULOUS,"Well, I just got this book, at Barnes & Noble for $6.00. Sorry Amazon. However, if you love these two guys as much as I do, you will love reading this book. This book is written by Jerry Lewis and so far I love they way he is writing it.I just started reading it so I really can't give you a complete review. But hey, It's Dean and Jerry, need I say more.You'll enjoy this book very much!"
4,Learned a Great Deal,"I will admit to having relatively unfavorable pre-concieved notions/memories about both Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis....but after reading this book, I felt I'd learned a great deal. The book not only shed light on the early entertainment world, but also on the lives and ups and downs of the careers of Dean and Jerry. A good read. 4 stars because there were moments in the biography that Jerry's drooling over Dean was a bit overdone."
5,Wonderful book !!!,I love Jerry Lewis and wanted to find out more about him. This book tells a lot about the time in his life when his career started and about his relationship with Dean Martin. I couldn't put the book down! It was so good that it left me wanting to know more. I highly recommend it.
5,Loved it!,"Amazing book. I love Dean and Jerry, and couldn't put this down. I literally laughed and cried. This was a very enjoyable book."
3,Kind of fun,"The movie was fairly interesting but I wouldnt want to watch it again. It wasnt interesting enough for me to want to watch any of the special features on the DVD. You could tell it was a low budget movie but it was done pretty well. At first I thought oh no, this is going to be another Doll movie like Puppet Master (those were so/so I thought but I guess a lot of people enjoyed them otherwise there wouldnt have been so many sequels) but the fairies were actually real people more like Gullivers Travels. Rodney McDowell was in it so it was nice to see a familar face. My 13 year old son really enjoyed it and thats part of the reason Im giving it 3 stars. Dont get it if your not a fantasy buff and want a truly scary movie, instead pick up Trilogy of Terror which I deem one of the truly scary movies to have a doll in it."
1,Lost art of Horror Movies,"The making of horror movies really has become a lost art. I purchased this movie expecting to see a remake of the classic ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"", which was made back in 1973. I was disappointed to say the least. This movie is not remotely scary and furthermore it is extremely boring. Cheap special effects, bad acting and an overall poor script doom this film. Do yourself a favor and rent the original if you are looking for a scare, this one will only waste your time and money."
2,Cheap Cheesy Horror Good for the Bored,"This movie was so low budget, cheesy, and loaded with generic actors (except McDowell and McCormick) it wasn't even funny. The only good part was the storyline about the fire in the 1950's and how it tied into the handyman and his sister. Do not waste your money buying or renting this unless you are twelve; instead wait for it to be on HBO like I did. The ""fairies"" were done well but the movie was no where near believeable like ""The Ring"" was."
5,I am in total agreement with Previous Reviewer,The first person who reviewed this is right- so much more of Cheri Oteri was missing from this DVD but I have waited (impatiently!) for YEARS for the release of this DVD so I am just glad to have some best of Cheri Oteri on SNL to watch- over and over. I hope they do release a part 2 DVD. Cheri Oteri needs her own show- like Tracey Ullman where she can explore her characters and create new ones. This DVD made me pee in my pants from laughter.
5,"best ""best of""","Best gift ever! I had been waiting for this to come out and it's even better than I expected. The audio commentary is hilarious! Hopefully, full seasons of SNL will be released soon."
1,very crass,wow I didn't remember Cheri's stint on SNL as most of these vignettes...not thrilled with this best of..giving it away..would NOT recommend
4,Funny dvd!,Cheri was one of my favorite SNLers so it was great to get this dvd and at such a great price!
3,"strong start, weak finish","THE NATURE OF BALANCE starts out strong-- very strong. Lebbon's writing vividly conveys a world turned upside-down by deadly apocalyptic dreams and nature gone berserk. Unfortunately, the explanation for all these mysterious events is rather weak and mundane, and I was able to guess a good part of the ending 150 pages before it was explained. It was like seeing the movie 2001, with the original ending replaced by the ending to 2010. Still, I would recommend this novel for the vivid writing."
5,Great,Grate guide for college search. In less than a week the book arrived. All Fiske guides are very useful if you are a college counselor or a student.
1,cheap but,"this item was cheap and now i know why, the first 30 pages are falling out, did not mentioned the binding of the book was not intact"
5,Non stop romance reading,"On a whim, I picked this up at a supermarket when visiting my son. I was hooked after the first page. Dani and Jack are a match made in heaven. The story unfolds as the secrets of the past hold them hostage to the love they once knew. But with Dani and Jack, these do not divide them, only draw them closer and the end makes their relationship stronger.They are both great characters with a warmth and understanding that cracks open even the cold heart of Dani's father.I can't wait to move onto the next Callahan brother's story.I only had two questions after I finished the book. Did Dani ever take Matt to get the promised dog and what was Matt's reaction to the long lost Holly. Perhaps we might get a glimpse of this in the next book.It has been a long time since I devoured a story as quickly as this one."
3,Why did JoAnn Ross turn Dani into a wimp,"I really had a hard time deciding how to rate this book. I enjoyed the first half of the book, and then noticed I kept putting it down more and more after that. I liked Jack from the get go, and all the way through the book. On the other hand Dani started out as such a strong character and then just grew weaker and weaker through out the book. I wanted to really like the book, but the plot was very slow and I was frustrated with Dani's inability to just tell the truth about what happened to her as a young child. I didn't buy the whole ""he has had so much death in his life, so I don't want to make him feel even worse"" line. I wanted to scream at her ""hey you want a serious relationship with this man, tell him the truth and quit being a wimp"". Also, I don't think that Dani could forgive her father as fast as she did, it just was not realistic to me."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I had this nice review typed out, and of course, Amazon loses it or it doesn't register. Ugh.Summing it up, this book was pretty good, albeit I think it could have been approved. Jack Callahan was yum - black haired, ear pierced, and broodingly manly. Delicious.I liked Dani as a loving mother, yet fiery woman in the prime of her life. She and Jack had good, noticeable chemistry that took flight in the romance scenes.What I thought was lacking was plot and timeline. I didn't feel that there was a definitive antagonist, and for the ones existing in this book, they were too indefinite for me. Sure, Dani's father is a total jackass, but that doesn't make an instant bad guy, at least for me.Other than that, the plot was too underdeveloped and the timeline felt rushed. I'll be reading 'River Road' next, so I hope Ross redeems herself for me. I really enjoy her writing style."
2,"It's ""blue"" alright.","There's no real harm in this book; in fact, it appears a lot of readers liked it more than my 2 stars. But after reading some really great steamy cajun romances by Sandra Brown, Nora Roberts, Linda Howard, Tami Hoag, etc., this one is shallow in comparison. This is the first of a trilogy, which does not bode well for the next two installments. BLUE BAYOU by itself is not a keeper. We shall see."
1,Doesnt really deserve any stars....,"Why would anyone buy a cd of another band trying to sound like deftones??? You cant do it, its not possible, you only come out looking like retards, Go make your own music Max Desecration, dont make the good stuff sound bad, the only people who should be playing deftones is deftones.."
2,Could probably pass it by...,"I don't entirely understand how this cd is allowed to exist... anyway. Like others have mentioned it's a little novel to hear other bands cover Deftones songs but for some reason I thought it was a collection of bands... in actuality it's just one.The music is decent, the band did a pretty good job of replicating the songs... but the vocals are sub-par. Which is to be expected when you are trying to take on one of the most excellent voices in alternative music.Perhaps worth checking out... even though it was a dollar I probably wouldn't buy it again. It's much more entertaining watching bands cover Deftones songs on youtube."
4,Good effort,"This tribute wont blow your mind away, but its fun to hear other bands play some Deftones covers. The overall quality is good, it doesnt sound like a cheap recording. If you're into the Deftones this cd is definitely worth purchasing. It adds a nice variety of sound to the Deftones library. Its definitely worth the money, but don't expect some religious Deftones revelation to come from it. Just some no name bands playing quality played/recorded covers."
4,Love this for my husband,This is the best gel for spiking hair without a hard feel. It doesn't leave the hair greasy afterward either. My husband uses this with the Marine Lusterizer. He used it when his hair was long and it brought out a beautiful wave to his hair. He also uses it now with his shorter cut for a messy look. It also doesn't flake which is great. A must for texturizing hair and hold without stiffness.
2,Fearless-doesn't live up to Lips creative standards,"1st I have been a true fan since the early 90's. I have pretty much been the only person in my circle of friends who is a fan. I have had great experiences seeing them in concert and am used to a standard of quality from the Lips. However, after I purchased Fearless Freaks and watched it with hopes there would be more footage highlighting the success of the band and its music, I was disapointed. Too much of the video is about Wayne's childhood with interviews of his partents. I believe 15-20 minutes of the video is about him playing football as a child (home movie footage included). I could have passed on this one."
4,Wonderful Intimate Portrayal (with plenty of bunny rabbits!),"This is a wonderful film, and one can tell that it's definitely a labor of love.I must say that I was disturbed by the drug use scene with Stephen. However, this is because I am a former addict. But I still think it was unnecessary to be so graphic; but he truly shared the perils of heroin addiction in the most real way.I do wonder how the movie will turn out. I can't believe the amount of energy Wayne possesses toward his projects. I found him to be a great role model (I am an artist myself, and quite lazy by comparison).Only one more complaint. Like in many documentaries, they will tease you with the beginning of a wonderful song, then speak over it, or cut away. I could have used less talk and more music, since this is what the documentary is ultimately about; well beside their lives and the creative process.I highly recommend this film. Oh, and yes, it is a bit too long; but it only proves how engaged the filmmaker is in the project."
3,It's okay,"It's full of a lot of where to find it, and what some of the words mean. Just like any concordance or very brief dictionary. I give a 3 because it's okay. Nothing above average."
4,A hefty EP at 41: 42 min!,"This is an excellent 'Diary of Dreams'(DoD) ""taster"" EP for those who want to hear one of the better cds that DoD has to offer.This EP is no small example of DoD's sound...its running time is 41:42 min long!It makes an excellent companion to the full prior release 'Nigredo'. Within its 7 tracks is a little bit of everything that makes Diary of Dreams so interesting, including tracks in German (don't worry if you don't know German, it has such an infectious beat it won't matter).Like all the DoD albums I own (4 others) the lyrics are included. The extended EP time is perfect with no filler and a solid, ""complete album"" flow. The lyrics are very dark but in a danceable way!"
2,Booty Call is better,This DVD isn't much of a workout. Get Booty Call by the same people for a great workout!
3,Uplifting Yet Sorrowful,"This is a book aimed primarily at Christians, to help them deal with the sorrow and stress of 9/11, and to also reinforce the positive things that came from that event.While I find it uplifting that many turned to Christ because of those acts of terrorism, I wholeheartedly disagree that it was part of ""God's plan.""I think that, in its place and for what it's worth, AS THE TOWERS FELL is an encouraging look at faith, but for those survivors left behind it may very well be small comfort."
1,USB to Serial Didn't work for me,"Still wanting to use my old Palm M105 PDA with a newly built desktop computer, without a serial interface, I purchased the Eforcity cable to use with the Palm serial cradle. Unfortunately, it never did, and I ended up getting a serial interface card instead."
1,Waste of money!,"This dongle is supposed to provide either serial or parallel connections to a USB port. It has an USB to Serial cable with connector screws on the serial side which must be removed before a serial device can be attached.There is a small CD in the package which contains driver files.Upon attempting to install the files Windows XP gives warning messages that the drivers are not listed as compatible. Guess what? The drivers really aren't compatible. I suppose with proper drivers it might work, but not as packaged."
1,I hope,"I hope that Russian government takes this ""anonymous"" author to court for publishing such a bunch of lies. It wouldn't be too difficult to provide some hard factual evidence, would it? Well, of course the author has no evidence, what saves him or her from a lawsuit is the well known inefficiency of Russian bureaucracy."
5,A German Woman Suffers the Russian occupation of Berlin at the end of World War II,"We don't know her name but we do know her intimate life as awell educated professional woman living in Berlin in April , 1945as the Russian army marched into the capital city of the Naziregime. In great detail this woman recounts life in the captured city where rape is an everyday happening (over 100,000Berlin women were raped according to some accounts); hunger isa constant and fear a given.The eight week diary she kept is accurate, grim and matter offact. This woman emerges as a survivor. Most of us live pampered lives where we think nothing of turning on the electricity, eating our fill and leaving home without fear.The Nazi regime was brutal and cruel but one does feel for thecivilians of Berlin as they suffered in the death throes of theirgreat city.The fate of women in war is rarely covered but this diary issure to be a classic of factual reporting by a participant in thehorrible events. Well done."
5,"Raw, Ragged Reality","Some books appeal to your intellect, others to your heart. This one hits you hard right in the gut. The author's shock, fear, suffering and revulsion are delivered relentlessly through her perceptive eyes, with poetic expressiveness and biting wit.Along with the horrific experiences she recounts, some of the most searing passages are the reflections of her heart and soul. In the original German, they are particularly touching and thought-provoking. Her character, humanity and indomitable spirit transcend the pages that she wrote.At the end of the nine-week period covered in the diary, I was struck by this true ""Triumph des Willens"" - the will to survive."
5,In Your Face,"Despite all of my attentions paid to the history of man's cruelty to man,(and women), over the course of the past few decades, I have never experienced a more poignant accounting of same than that which ""A Woman in Berlin"" had to offer. The author's physical survival and psychological victory over the most tragic circumstances imaginable is a testament to the power of applied intellect in the face of mindless savagery. Truly, this literary work is a wonderful testament to the strength of the female spirit and the durability of a pure human sole."
2,Worrisome,"After the glowing reviews, I ordered this book. Before it arrived, a letter to the editor of the New York Times appeared, questioning the authenticity of the diary. The rapes, the hardships of life were described clinically. Perhaps that is the language of the distraught, but it could also be that of a publishing house writing a serial. One must believe that this is the authentic voice of a real, single woman for this book to have an impact and, after reading with a skeptical mind, I have doubts."
5,Fascinating WW2 memoir,"This is one the best WW2 firsthand accounts written by a German woman I have ever read. I could not put this book down.It is the fascinating account of the last days of Berlin under the Third Reich, as well as when the Russians conquered the city. The anonymous author kept a journal of her experiences from which this book was later derived. I was stunned by the number of rapes committed by the Russians upon the German women and girls--I had no idea. I was also stunned and impressed by the survival instincts of the average female German civilian during this time.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about the daily life of German civilians (particularly the women) during the Third Reich/WWII. (less)"
3,cannibal alien from outer space,"PreyWith a title like ""Prey"" one would expect this British sci-fi horror film to either be very bloody or very lurid. In this case, it's both. A cannibal alien from outer space on a reconnaissance mission to Earth drops in on the estate of a wealthy, eccentric British lesbian and her neurotic woman-child live-in girlfriend. Now how can anyone possibly go wrong starting with a premise like that? It has the feel of a Merchant-Ivory film adapted by Roger Corman (or maybe a Roger Corman film adapted by Merchant-Ivory?) As added attractions, the women are erotic and beautiful and the music, for some reason, is awfully nice in parts. A great B-movie.Prey isn't for all tastes, but for the game British sci-fi or horror fan it's a great treat."
5,A wonderful read,I am a former runner who is just starting to get back into running again after a long break. Reading this book was so enjoyable that I struggled to put it down. It is not so much a how to book but more of an essay on what runners experience on many levels during a run.
2,Not what was advertised,"This item was advertised was a 2-CD set and I received only one CD, I REALLY wanted the Comptons Interactive Bible, but did not receive it. When I contacted the seller about the missing CD they didn't have it. He refunded half my purchase price but now I am left with spending money for a CD I do not want nor like. The seller was nice about it, but bottom line I didn't get what I wanted."
4,Works well,"I purchased two of these: one for each vehicle. I have only installed one as of yet. The one installed works well enough but could probably be more powerful...the truck takes several hours to preheat even at relatively high ambient temps (32-40). This is on a Toyota 4.7L V8 (UZJ100) so engine size likely is the problem. I had hoped it would be faster. That said; leaving it plugged in overnight works great. Definitely improves gas mileage when I take the truck out for short errands and it is nice to have the heat kick in only a half mile down the road.My wife's car uses a 3.3L V6, I expect it will heat a lot faster with this same part.The only improvement his part could use is a longer cord. I had to splice in about another two feet to make it long enough to run out through he grill so i can reach the plug without having to open the hood.Overall it's good equipment; I recommend it."
3,pretty nice,Overall the glasses are pretty nice. The only thing is the ear pieces are not adjustable. Pairs we have bought elsewhere were adjustable.
3,Teens find love in 4-H. How quaint.,"There's nothing particularly offensive about ""Opposites Attract""; unfortunately, there's nothing particularly likeable about it either. A few glimmers of humor, slightly complex characters, and a late-dawning moral about standing up for oneself and being honest in relationships keep the novel from utter mediocrity.The story centers on self-proclaimed ""wimp"" Jessie LaFont who begins to rethink her priorities when thrown into the company of serious 4-H champ Dave Morton, who challenges her to pit his dairy project against her fashion project for the blue ribbon.Somehow amidst their squabbling, bickering, and dog-related foibles, the two ""opposites"" do indeed attract, and Jessie eventually gains the courage to follow her heart. (Too bad her new sense of empowerment doesn't allow her to do much more than ditch her best friend's big party and dump the modeling deal her mom arranged for her.)"
4,Anthology -1 (Rate as 4 1/2 Stars),"This is a very good CD, sound quality is great, presentation is great all Top 100 except 1 (Comin' Down Tonight). If only they only would have gone that one more. The best Hits CD to come out so far! Very Good Buy, Worth the money."
5,"Glad I took a ""Second Chance!""",I took in a .38 Special concert last month at the beautiful Tuachan Amphitheatre in the gorgeous red cliffs of Southern Utah on the weekend of the Academy of County Music awards in Las Vegas. What a great night it was listening as they played hit after hit under the stars in that wonderful venue. Speaking of stars...Nashville had a few of it's own who made the drive up from Vegas for some good music. I guess they knew they would blend in with the crowd. I came right home and ordered this fantastic compilation. Anthology is great! You can't go wrong here.
3,Beware: TCCS is half vaporware,"A good general coverage of RCS and SCCS. However, more than half the book is devoted to a project control system called TCCS. Nowhere in the book does it indicate that TCCS is only an alpha version right now and that several of the features described in the book are not available yet!"
2,"A good place to start, but only for the first three chapters","This book does a good job of discussing what Source Control is, and a decent job of describing how to use the RCS command set. But the chapters on SCCS can be skipped if you already have the GNU Tools. As a matter of fact, Programming with GNU Software does a better job of consicely discussing RCS. The rest of the book does a good job of discussing the intricacies of Souce Control as your environment becomes more complex, but the solution details presented for Project Control were incomplete since much of what is proposed is not ready for prime time."
2,Good intro to source control,"This book provided a good introduction to source control management but was week on implementation of an interface system. TCCS was explained in detail but I was personally looking for the knowledge from TCCS to implement my own interface to RCS via scripting, which was not explained. I too skipped all of the chapters on SCCS and most of the chapters on TCCS and found only 10 of the 23 chapters useful."

A Boags Draught beer actually .May the future Prince of Darkness go on to greater greatness ,well worth the money ive bought 2 , just in case someone steals one .."
5,God Damn Good,I'm a big fan of Zakk and this great stuff. If you like Zakk and BLS then you won't be disappointed at all. SO GET IT!!! Of course if you're a jealous no named wanna be then this DVD may enhance your feelings of inadequacy and force you to rate this DVD low.
5,AWESOME,"AWESOME DVD!!! Excellently recorded and played by Zakk and the band, packed with bonus material; interview, exclusive home footage, Zakk playing the National Anthem at an NHL game, Three guitar lessons from the man himself, Two songs live with the Tokyo Chapter and some hilarious footage in a ""Stupid [...]"" section! HELL YEAH, buy it, it won't leave your player!!-Kief- UK Chapter"
4,Good concert,"This is a great concert. The only possible drawback is the excessive, unnecessary, pointless cursing."
2,Zakk can't sing,"I guess every band has loyal fans that will praise just about anything the band does. Most of the reviews of this Black Label Society DVD are an enthusiastic ""two thumbs up."" I've got 2 fingers up for Zakk, but they ain't thumbs.Just kidding. This DVD's not so bad. I've always admired his skill on guitar. How can you not??? I've got all the BLS stuff, so I'm definitely a fan. But the guy can't sing. This DVD is proof of that. I was so pumped up to buy this thing when it came out, but man was I disappointed.On the positive side, there's some cool extra stuff on the disc, including a guitar lesson in which Zakk breaks down a couple classic solos note-by-note. Pretty cool if you're a guitarist.However, one of the DVD's extras, the interview with Zakk, shows what a drunken dope the guitarist really is. Did this guy graduate high school? Mr. BLS is no PhD. Heck, he's not even a GED. It's good for a laugh, though."
1,This idiot barely walks upright,"the only thing you need to know about this DVD is that at the end of it he yells ""Pray for mother f**cking war!"" This was recorded before the US invaded Iraq. Its one thing to support the troops, but to pray for war? What a sociopath.Between his repetitive and boring songs, a drunken Zakk rants like an amphetamine addicted pre-pubescent boy with Turrette's Syndrome. Sure, he's a pretty decent guitarist, but he's a one trick pony. If you've heard 3 of his songs, you've heard his entire repertoire of pyrotechnics. Too bad there's no song writing to go with the posturing. I've enjoyed watching Zakk play with Ozzy, but on his own, this idiot and his music is just a mess."
4,Zakk Wylde does it again!,"As a huge Black Label Society fan, I was wondering for months how this DVD was going to turn out, but I must say that it is awesome. The concert footage is raw and uncut and the bonus material is great. Some of the bonus features include Zakk playing the national anthem at a hockey game, and the ""Stillborn"" video. All of the concert footage is clear and well lit, and it is not a low budget DVD. This is just another A+ for Zakk."
2,Low capacity fan,"The side panel came damaged with many of the plastic rivets broken, had to use rivets from old side panel. Fan is not powerful, I saw no decrease in temperature. I have found some higher output fans through a diffrent vendor which I may purchase. With this being a thermaltake product, I was very disappointed as normally thermaltake puts out a very good product. If you are looking for more cooling, you may want to purchase a fan and adapt it to your existing side paneland save yourself the cost of this panel-"
5,Make your whole family smile,"I found this book at my local library and by the last page I knew I had to own this cookbook. Since it was out of print I thought I would have to zerox every page. Fortunately I found out there were used copies available. Every recipe is easy and can be made with little effort. It is nicely organized into three basic catergories, poultry, meat, and seafood. They range from simple down home buttermilk fried chicken & biscuits to a restaurant nite-out scaloppine. Easy follow directions with basic pantry ingredients."
4,Ok,It's practical and sort of cute. The zippers are a little cheap but its not a bad bag for walking around the city. It's a good medium sized bag
5,Messenger Bag,"I bought this bag after reading the previous reviews. One review scared me because I was afraid if I purchased this bag it would not turn out to be what I expected. But I read the others it convinced me to buy it.I dont regret buying it. I love it. It is what the other positive remarks said, it is just perfect to put a book to read a small notebook. and it has two zipper bags. One at the outside back part and one in the front of main pocket. They are very useful to separate small items. I recommend it."
4,Nice bag and unbeatable price,"This is a fairly basic bag, but with enough pockets and zippered compartments to make it practical. The back zippered pocket (behind the flap) is really perfect for my little notebook and a paperback. The inside pockets for pens, etc. are also very handy. Certainly a great bargain."
2,too small for my needs,"I suppose it's my own fault for not noticing the size. This isn't made for 8 1/2"" x 11"" sized items. I had originally purchased it to carry my tutoring supplies in, but I'll have to find something else. My sister loves it, however, and uses it as a purse. I think using ""Messenger Bag"" as a title is a bit deceptive. Perhaps ""Messenger Purse""?"
4,Messenger Bag Review,"The delivery was a little faster than i expected. I was a little surprised when it showed. Bag was a little smaller than i imagined but i didnt read the dimensions so thats all my fault there.Other than that, the bag is fine! It is perfect for what i needed it for.The strap is nice and easily adjustable. Space is alright, just enough to hold what i need it to, and the compartment on the back is a nice touch. also the metal ring on the front is perfect for attaching ur keys to if u have a caribiner clip.if u want a simple bag to hold some electronics and a few notebooks and supplies, like me, dont pass this up. great find!"
1,Musty Bags,I ordered One of these bags; received two by mistake and they both smell very musty. Hung them in my garage at below freezing for a couple of weeks and still can't get the stink out.
5,Who the hell is Billy Childish?,"An excellent documentary.Brilliant all round really....a big insight into the man...good music scenes, good candid scenes, interesting & informative.It's a shame he's dead;-)"
3,"Not what I expected, but awesome","I bought this CD thinking it was the band <a href=""http://www.musicforlosers.com"">Losers of the Year</a> and was a little disappointed at first. But after giving it a few listens this CD is band is pretty cool too! I would recommend it to anyone who likes Punk Rock!"
5,"Absolutely stuuning, gorgeous book.","Great coffee table book.The hologram images on the cover set the trend for the rest of the book. A satellite image is compared to a corresponding cartographical map of the same area.All the great cities of the world are included ... New York, Los Angeles, New Dehli, London, Paris, Moscow, Tokyo, etc.The book dramatically highlights the damaging effects of the greenhouse effect, plus the recent Aceh Tsunami.DK books continue their great pictorial format/standard. This book has enough maps covering the world, to be classed as an atlas."
5,Extremely high-quality photos with great history/geography lesson,"I'm quite impressed with this book. I found it for $10 at Barnes and Noble. To me, the analogy is like finding a $200,000 Ferrari for $50,000. The book's pictures are really high-quality and are accompanied by a nice history/geography lesson. I'm also surprised that there were around 10 or so left of this book in the bargain section. Buy up!p.s. I'm going to write the exact same for Earthcam as I truly feel the same way although this might sound silly. :-)Brian"
4,The big view from your coffee table,"If you've had an atlas as a coffee table book, then this is even better. Maps and satellite photos get quiet little oohs and ahhs, and parents can show the pictures to the kids and keep them sitting quietly while you get the coffee and cookies for your guests. Provides non-controversial topics for conversation, and doesn't embarrass anyone by revealing too much of your interests or your family members."
4,He Shoots He Dies !,"Are You Afraid of the Dark- The Tale of the Horrifying Hockey Team, is a mystery book by K.S Rodriguez. It takes place in the 21st century in a small town in the United StatesOne day John, a kind, smart, athletic, twelve year old, and his friends come to their hockey pond and see other kids playing at their pond. The other kids said they would not give the pond back. John's team said that they would play them for the pond. If John's team wins they get to keep the pond or if the other team wins they get to keep the pond. It is a battle between the two teams.I thought it was a very good book. It's suspenseful. A couple of scenes were impossible to believe because people cannot disappear. But overall it was good.The age I would recommend is 10-12 years old. This is a good book for people who like mystery books, people who are hockey fans, and people who watch the TV show Are You Afraid of the Dark.Will John let the other team win or will he win and let his friends die?"
2,Giga Pet Not so fun,"I thoght the Giga Pet Pixie would be really fun, but it ended up being really hard at times. You start out with 100 bucks, and some food, medicine, and toys. But after you run out of bucks, it is really hard to buy anything, beacuse making money is really hard. I t was really fun at frist, but now I am broke, and my pixie is sick and hungry, and I can't get very much money easily. I would recomend a Tamagotchi instead of a Giga Pet, beacuse from what I heard they are much easier to handle."
3,Absolutely hilarious.,"Okay first off, I'd like to point out the fact that I am an Atheist and if I was Christian I probably would burn this book. But from a non-Christian point of view this book is very crazy and insane making it very enjoyable. The plot: It appears ol' Jesus is having a bad day and all his miracles aren't quite what they used to be. (Ex: He tries to walk on water and sinks) So basically the Jesmeister says, ""I need a vacation from being a savior for a day. The next 20 or so pages has some hobo doing some crazy antics. (I say hobo because Jesus wouldn't be caught dead doing some of these idiotic things.) If you're a devout Christian, though, I warn you, you are going to HATE this book like the devil himself. But if you're one of the other kinds of people by all means read on."
2,What a let down!!!,"My son bought this expecting to see some awesome skating, but instead it is what it says. ""THE MAKING OF"" What a waste. I thought $10 was kind of cheap. Turns out it was about $9 to much! Spend your money on the Gigantic Skatepark Tour video's if you want to be entertained."
3,ok,"This was ok for what it was. We paid less than a rental to buy it so it wasn't a complete loss. We didn't know what to expect but once you appreciated that it was a ""making of"" type of show, it grew on you."
3,Horsetrailer hauls everything!!,This Freightliner with horsetrailer was a big hit with the boys. They used the trailer to haul everything from race cars to farm animals to alien space ships. Kept them occupied for hours at a time.
3,Canadian Book of the Road,"This book is somewhat outdated as far as maps go, but the local interests are pretty much the same. It makes a great study for children in home schooling, which is popular right now, and for parents wanting to simply educate their kids and themselves about Canada."
5,For the true fan,"This is a wonderful documentary on one of the best musicals ever written. Granted that after running for 42 years there are many more stories, but the DVD would have to have a length of 42 years.Any DVD that shows even small portions of the original staging is to be enthusiastically welcomed.To clear up one point in a previous review, it is clearly stated that Liza Minelli appeared in another production of the show NOT the New York version. That is why she is not interviewed."
1,Quite a disappointment,"There was so much more to The Fantasticks, but this video didn't show it. The passing of the legendary Jerry Orbach leaves many of his inside stories untold. Liza Minnelli wasn't even interviewed. The story told by the composer and lyricist was interesting, but I still felt there was so much more to be said. It's on a par with the disappointing film version of The Fantasticks."
3,I Wish it Were Better,"I really enjoyed Mr. Bradley's previous book on the first sound musicals, but this one falls short. Not only is there not enough actual text, but there is no indication of the availability of these rare shorts. Mostly it is a list of the shorts themselves, with a one sentence synopsis, and a credit list. And the lists aren't in chronological order, they're featured alphabetically. Some of the photos have incomplete captions. For the cover photo he only identifies two of the actors featured, and in one glaring omission Mr. Bradley identifies an obscure band leader without mentioning the very young Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey who are clearly sitting on the bandstand. Nice try on this one, but I was largely unsatisfied. The third star is for the exhaustively researched filmography."
2,Not so good....,We have purchased a lot of Vtech toys over they years and this one is a real disappointment. It is difficult to get to work accurately and isn't very entertaining. My daughter played with it once and doesn't seem intersted in playing with it again.Oh well...maybe next time.
3,the white man's indian: images of the american indian...,berkhofer does a good job explaining the history of the image that caucasian's have of the native american. the only drawback is that it was written 23 years ago and the reader must keep reminding themselves of this fact when faced with outdated material concerning public opinion and/or lack of scholarly developments and discoveries of native society.
1,Repetitive,Not only is the Text out of date Berkhofer never goes anywhere with his ideas. He just ends up repeating himself over and over until they have lost all meaning. It is amazing to me that a book that has no point could ever get published.
1,What?!,"I can't believe that ""An Apple Gathering"" isn't included in this book...one of her most lyrical works with great puns.Very disappointed, since all the other works listed are excellent and I would buy this book in an instant if ""Apple Gathering"" was among them."
5,I'm a Barista!,I use this to lightly dust cinnamon over stencils set on top of cappuccinos. People think I'm amazing. Works for me.(I'm not really a barista.)
1,Poor quality cheap hose DO NOT BUY,"Not what I expected and in fact unusable- very cheap hose and not worth anywhere near the price. This is a complete rip off. I was looking for a real commercial vacuum hose as sold at Home Depot, I needed a substantial hose that would be crush proof and kink proof, This hose is not it.!DO NOT BUY THIS!"
3,Down the Barrel or down the...?,"This movie is not too bad. Too many characters in it talk too much, however. For all of the good cinema, shot by great TV director of photography Rick Gunter (BEVERLY HILLS, 90210 and WIZARDS OF WAVRLY PLACE), the sound had a few issues. Enjoyable in many ways, though. Lots of steep irony. I enjoyed it."
1,Why Can't Cash Money Just Go Away???,This CD is horrible. Every song sounds the same. Thats something that Mannie Fresh does so well. It seems that Cash Money has lost alot of their fans. Expect this to drop off the charts within 4 weeks.. Don't waste you money on this.. Cash Money is DEAD......
4,Cash Money Worldwide,"Hi, this is Hibe from Berlin, Germany... Yes, Cash Money also got fans overseas, even as they are basically a local thing like anyone from N'awlins. But Berlin is a local thing like hell, so I listen to CMR all the time. And this CD is as fly as most of the CMR'er stuff. Get it right, keep it right, that's it....."
4,More Thugged Out Than Wayne,"I know this might offend many of the Wayne fans. Turk has a better flow and a more thugged out style than Wayne. Plus, it jus takes alot to get use to Lil Wayne's funny sounding voice. At The Same Time, It Is In Me, Growing Up, Untamed Guerilla, Freak Da HOes, Project are all tyght songs. His flows are natural unlike Wayne's. Many ppl think Turk is the weakest link of Cash Money but he is not, and this album he did not need the help of many other Cash Money artists. Turk also had a different taste than the other Cash Money artists, he raps about poverty and struggles in his early years more than Cars, Cash, Ice, Hoes and stuff like that."
4,Strong Debut,"Turk come out strong with his debut album. The mannie Fresh beats are dope and Turk has mad flows. The cd has many strong tracks. Turk is gonna be the next big cash money artist. My favorite trracks are 4,5,6,8,9,12,14,19,21. It is a very cool cd, and the best one cm has come out with in a while"
5,HARD TO FIND IN THE STATES,"This perfume was originally found in Paris, France and never located it again here in the states. It has a wonderful lasting smell and the price was awesome! thanks for the great deal."
1,"This is a ""cheap perfume"" and a waste of money","The item arrived on time and undamaged, but it smells nothing like freesia, despite its name and description. It smells like a cheap hair spray, unfortunately. Due to the seller's return policy of a 15% restocking fee for opened products (How else would I know what it smells like?) and the shipping fee I am not even attempting to return the item, but it is simply a waste of my 21 dollars."
1,Not good,I bought this perfume for my friend who loves the smell of freesia. She was extremely disappointed and I felt bad too. Cheap unpleasant smell. Nothing to do with freesia.
1,Really????,"Did I just pay $100 for this ???? First off, please know I spent a few months shopping for a bean bag chair for a 60lb child. This thing is the perfect size but it is a huge ROCK!!!!!!!!!!! So, common sense tells me to just let some off the stuffing out, no biggie. BUT THE ZIPPER IS EITHER JAMMED OR BROKEN!!!!!!! There is just no winning,,,,I guess after trying everything to unzip this thing I will have to take it to an upolstery store and spend even more money. It is unusable in this condition.,,,,there is no GIVE to it at all...i feel as if someone is playing a practical joke on us by over filling this BIG PAPER WEIGHT ,!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Demon Teds at there finest,"If you buy any one Demented Are Go album, this would be the one to get! A great introduction to the sickness and sin that is Demented Are GoSTAY SICK!!!"
3,Amusing,"'Zemsta' is one of the famous comedies in the history of the Polish theatre. Wajda did a good job in bringing Fredra's 19th century play to the silver screen.The cast is made up of the greats Olbrzyski, Gajos and even Roman Polanski. The text is hillarious and witty however the English translations are not very good, occasionally whole phrases are left out or changed."
3,ON TIME CLOCK....LOSES TIME!,"I chose the JBL Time Machine because i needed all 3 functions - clock, radio and ipod player. The radio reception is not great AND the CLOCK LOSES about and HOUR A DAY!!!I need to return it."
5,"Excellent, solid advice, well written","Despite the indulgent and rather cheezy-sounding title, this is a sensible, well-written book with a nice balance between general discussions and anecdotal accounts of ""horror stories"" of parents confronting difficult choices in dealing with grown children who can't seem to grow up. I checked a few books on the subject, and this was by far the most useful."
4,very helpful,The advise in this book is exactly what I needed to hear. Very helpful. Would recommend for anyone with kids that are 18-25.
4,When our Grown Kids Disappoint Us: ............,Good points. A serious problem which is rarely discussed. Too embarassing for the parents. It helped us.
3,Ok read,"This was recommended to me by a friend. The content was good, but I found the book difficult to read."
5,When our grown kids break our hearts,"Wow! This book could have been written by me, although there was no specific advice on what to do; it did resonate with my feelings of despair. Sometimes it helps to know you are not the only one.I am a 55 year old widow currently supporting my 26 year old son, his 25 year old girlfriend, my 11 month old granddaughter and another baby due in 4 months! I am recently separated from myhusband of three years who has no children or any patience for my attachment . I am in great need of help!"
5,Jane Adams speaks for all of us,"It felt as if Jane Adams was sitting at my kitchen table helping me work through my complicated feelings about my daughter and her beau. With her warm and practical wisdom, this author manages to provide generous comfort and sound advice at the same time.If you feel guilty, or critical, or even just frustrated with your grown-up kids, you'll find this book reads like a tall glass of cold water on a really hot day."
3,When our grown kids disappoint us,"Overall, I was rather disappointed. My husband didn't even bother finishing the book. This book is great for giving examples of the many difficult scenarios parents face with adult children. However, there really weren't any clear suggestions to solve any of these issues. I know what I'm dealing with, now know that others are experiencing similar, or worse, situations, but still have no solution. I felt it was a waste of my money. I can commiserate with other parents for free on a blog."
3,A disappointment,"If you have read a good book on this subject, don't get this one. It has nothing new and is not well presented."
3,Blaylock shakes things up a bit,"Other reviewers have noted that with this book Blaylock puts his trademark whimsy in the background and replaces it in the foreground with a really creepy villain. Perhaps the book's greatest flaw is that the nastiness of the human villain, towards the end, eclipses the eeriness of the deceased villain -- the ghost whose pervasive presence gives the book so much of its tense atmosphere. Although the ghost is responsible for the chills in the first half or three quarters of the book, by the end it seems practically benign in comparison to the vile Edmund, and one begins to wonder whether the book could have been written without the supernatural component and had equal impact.Still, a suspenseful and interesting read."
4,Great resource for those new to Colorado,"I've lived in colorado over 12-years, and this book would have been a great help when I first moved here. And now as a current resident, I see several parts of the book that can still be helpful to me. The 12-chapters include info. on moving tips, Colorado history, schools, taxes, motor vehicles, business start-up info. & high altitude living. This book would be a great resource for any one recently moved to Colorado, or planning to move there."
4,Fast paced murder mystery with unique premise.,"This is an exceptionally fast paced thriller with an unusual premise. The terror that the parents feel comes out at you through the pages. The absolute overwhelming horror that something has occured which will forever change the family life and nothing can be done to change what has occurred. The mother and father are well honed characters who let the reader know that sometimes really bad things happen to good people. If this book only reminds us how quickly your life can change, it is well worth the read."
2,Kindle edition - Several ERRORS!!,"Kindle edition has several grammatical errors. The person that was typing it for the electronic edition must have been rushing and missed tons of periods, spelled words wrong and capitalization in weird places. BECOMES VERY ANNOYING. Otherwise the novel is for a class I am taking and the content of the story is not worth reading if you don't have to."
1,Thoroughly unable to sympathize with the parental plight,"While I appreciate the difficult theme that Brown tackles here--just how far would you go to protect your children?--I found myself heartily wishing for the son to be found out and hauled off to prison. He was sullen, unpleasant, a murderer (!), and, best of all, a sexual molestor of his own sister. Try as I might, I couldn't understand why I would want to protect such an individual from the legal consequences of his own chosen actions. If there had been some glimmer of doubt, some moral ambiguity as to whether or not his actions really should be punished, *that* would have created a compelling conflict. But I'm not inspired to question my moral assumptions by parents too cowardly to deal appropriately with the matter, simply aghast."
3,Deja Vu!,"I am halfway through reading this book and am stunned at the similarities between it and Judith Kelman's ""After the Fall"". In Kelman's book, a New England couple are stunned when their teenage son is accused of attacking a neighborhood girl. The mother is a doctor; the father is more of a house husband, and they have a preadolescent daughter, too....the same cast of characters as in ""Before and After""! The simliarities don't end there....as the couple struggle to cope with the accusations, they are faced with neighborhood gossip, harassing phone calls and a lot of unanswered questions from their uncooperative son. I feel as though I am reading the same exact book for the second time!"
1,"The Family that Slays Together, Stays Together","Sickening. That's the best word I can come up with to describe this novel. A teenage boy slaughters his girlfriend. His father immediately destroys the evidence. Mom is unhappy about it, but goes along for the ride. Dad helps son craft a false story that will stand up in court. Nowhere in this book do the parents confront the son, and tell him what he did was wrong. Their machinations are ultimately successful in helping him get off scot-free. The family moves out of state, and (presumably) lives happily ever after. And we're supposed to sympathise with these morally bankrupt felons? I wanted to see them all doing hard time."
2,A poor choice.,"I was quite disappointed. While the plot may have had potential, the book is simply not a good read. The characters are not realistic, and it seems that Brown puts too much effort in trying to reach the audience with her ""message."" Not worth it."
2,I've read much better,"I didn't care for the way that each chapter was written about the thoughts of each family member, except for the murderous son. We never hear much from him. Enjoyed the beginning, then I kept skipping pages waiting to read about what really happened. The family didn't seem bothered that their son had killed a girl, rather that he may go to jail. The mother was the only one who showed some concern for the girl's parents. The book could have gone into more detail about the trial, but most of the book was about the father's thoughts. Don't recommend it. When I saw Merryl Streep was in the movie version, I know the movie must be pretty slow moving, as are all of Merryl's movies."
3,An immediately likable album,"For those of you looking for more predictable + repetitive (and hence, more danceable) ""drum'n'bass"" (is this ""drum'n'bass""?) routines, this one is for you. It is easy to immediately like this album, but I wonder for how long it can sustain your interest."
3,"Dry Reading, But Useful","McElroy and Townsend's medical anthropology text is one of the classics in its field. I personally find the going very slow; I don't think that academic texts necessarily need to be presented in so pedantic a format. However, the information contained in the studies is quite useful to the anthropology student's understanding of disease in a cultural and ecological context."
3,urban striptease booty call and abs too,"this was a good work out but if you expect to learn how to dance sexy like a stripper DO NOT GET THIS DVD! this is all basically squats and lunges and other resistance. i was disappointed b/c i wanted to do an excercise i could use later...for my husband and this is DEFINATELY NOT IT. so if you want a workout like all the others, go ahead and get this one."
2,Boring,I really didn't like this video. The picture was bad quality and they didn't seem to be doing anything out of the ordinary. I found it boring and it was a lot more than other ones I have purchased and loved. (The Biggest Loser)
4,Just as pictured,"They're cute, just like the picture. I first saw them at Antropologie--for $12! I'm glad I ordered them here instead."
5,Great looking pirate hat,Hat worked out great for my costume. Be aware due to the way this is packaged you may have to re-shape the hat somewhat when you get it. Looks excellent!
4,great for passing time,"Big screen, light (not heavy), portable = great for the elderlies. It's a great pass time, especially if you enjoy slots and have lots of waiting times (eg. for doctors' appointments). Two things that're not so good: (1) the instructions don't tell you how or how much you win. Do you need two BARS plus 3 cherries, or at least 3 BARS, etc? (2) You can't lock the ON key. So you might get into embarrassing moments if you are in an elevator and you accidentally have the ON key pressed in your bag, and the slot sound goes on, and everyone in the elevator wonders what that sound is!"
4,Gaming or gambling,This toy is just fun to play for anyone who likes slots. Not educational at all unless you plan on gambling for your income. Maybe this would teach how seldome you actually win.
5,bought for a gift for my 87 year old mother.,Its nice and big for her to see and hold but not so big she can't handle it.I would buy again.
3,No color,"I knew this was only black and white when I ordered the item. However, I didn't realize the lack of color would be so hard to see and appreciate."
5,good job.,"After having one for several years and being retired, I was getting nervous as to how much longer it would last. Well I still have my old one and it's still working great. I was surprised they were still being made."
5,My Nana and Papa love it!,"My Nana and Papa love any form of hand held slot or poker machine and this was no exception. The screen was easy to read, and the game was fun and easy to play."
4,Great Little Game,"Got this for my 91 year old mother. She plays it by the hour. She can see the screen and finds the slot sound entertaining. She doen't know really how to play it, but it keeps her amused for a long time."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOM, SHE IS 87, WE CAN'T SEE, HARD TO PLAY, A FEW OF US HAD A HARD TIME TO UNDERSTAND IT, I WISH IT HAD A LIGHT, AND BETTER PLAYING SKILLS....................I WOULD RETURN IT, BUT IT WILL COST MORE FOR WHAT I PAID FOR IT!!!!"
1,A Real Disappointment,"Screen is very dark. Symbols are in dim, hazy dark gray. Hard to get points. Rarely get any good matches. Not a fun game at all!"
4,Great replacement but ....,Went on very quickly. Fits great.The cover however has a heavy grain texture that traps dirt. So going through the car was it comes out not looking very good. Requires a manual brushing and wipe down.My other cover was more smooth and did not have this trouble.Bob H
3,"Product good, Price lousy","Standard Process supplements are reputed to be the best in the world. However, they are selling this bottle of 330 Calcium Lactate tabs for $20 and my doctor sells the exact same thing for $7. Shop around!"
1,Everyone and everything is racist!,"Essentially, this book just set out to prove that everyone and everything is racist. There was little support for any of the arguments, and a lot of them were just circular arguments, reworded for emphasis. I was unable to sell it back to a bookstore after I completed the course, which only fuels my bitterness towards this book."
4,Talented artist.,"Clearly the best music in this cd is The West Wing theme. It's a great show in every way, and the powerful theme music proves it."
1,Music by W G Snuffy Smith,The primary reason for ordering this CD was for the theme for West Wing. It was the one track that was defective. The other tracks ranges from adequate to poor.
5,Snuffy is smokin'!,"Great CD! Snuffy's depth of musicality is evident with all of the soundtrack work he does, but here he takes it all to the next level with one of the best CDs I've heard in ages! This is a must-have for anyone who appreciates well-written, multi-dimensional music. Bravo, Snuff!"
5,WHAT A FIND!,"I HAVE BEEN SEEING THIS GUY'S NAME FOR YEARS ON T.V. AND WAS CURIOUS TO FIND OUT WHAT HE WAS ABOUT MUSICALLY (SANS T.V.). THE CD IS GREAT. BEAUTIFUL & LUSH. GREAT FOR A SUNDAY MORNING. THE ADDITION OF ""WEST WING"" IS COOL AS WELL"
5,This is a 10 Star Mood-Enhancing CD!,"I came across this CD while looking for others and intuitively, I felt it might be of interest. Excuse me for saying this, but I had never heard of W.G. Snuffy Walden before although I have seen the series ""West Wing"" on TV and heard the theme music which he wrote and two ""bonus"" takes of this are at the end of this fine CD.The music on this CD is beautifully written and performed by Snuffy and/or his friends and is a pleasure to take in over and over. The moods range from mellow, lofty, airy, soothing, melancholy, contemplative, meditative, inspiring, and spiritual.There are Celtic-like vocals in the background on some cuts along with a beautiful and pleasing arrangements of acoustic and electric guitar, violin, viola, percussions, drums, piano, cello, and woodwinds.Those who enjoy this type of music will be overjoyed- it's a real jewel and I have put it right at the top of all my mellow mood enhancing CDs!"
3,mega blocks monster truck,"I too have had the problem of incomplete sets on several occassions-although they will send you out replacement parts, you have to wait awhile as they're shipped from Belgium-however, they are cheap compared to other leading brands and I think if you prepare yourself for the fact that there may well be missing parts-you can still have fun building them!"
5,Disconcertingly Marvellous,"Manitas de Plata is a prodigy among virtuoso as far as acoustic guitar is concerned: his abilities; the rhythms and the melodies he produces are so, that you hardly believe that such overwhelming mastery at the guitar is ever possible. When Manitas de Plata plays the guitar, it is like somebody with faith praying intently.You may like the style or not, but if you instinctively go for the sweetness of acoustic guitar, you will definitely be overawed. In fact you may be overawed independently of your musical preference; if you are somehow moved by virtuosity.This album is one of the the very best of Manitas de Plata and is absolutely awesome in the quality of the flamenco feel, or instinct, and the flawless ability to transcribe it on the guitar!!"
1,not what I expected,"Wynn's voice is good, but as I like Rockabilly not Western I did not like this CD,""come on"" was the one and only track I liked. Sorry Wynn not my style."
5,early California Country,"Here's the guy that kicked off the California Country sound. You can hear Wynn's influence not only in Merle Haggard and Buck Owens, but moreso, in Dwight Yoakam! In fact, Dwight covered Wynn's fine hit ""Playboy"". Included in this collection, are ""Long Black Limousine"" (a song covered by both Lefty and Keith Whitley) and ""Above and Beyond"" (A Buck Owens covered hit). Also, the duet with Jan Howard, ""How the Other Half Lives"" and ""Wrong Company"", will rival any duet Conway & Loretta or George & Tammy ever put together. This album is absolute pure honky-tonk with the finest fiddle sound to ever come out of your speakers (one listen to ""Wishful Thinking"" and you'll agree). If you like the Bakersfield Sound, you owe it to yourself to get this one. A+"
2,Review for the Dodo edition NOT the book which is a 5 star!,"This Dodo Press edition is appalling. Unfortunately there has been no proof reading done whatsoever and so the book is laden with typos and errors:'se' instead of 'she', 'by' instead of 'but', 'pong' instead of 'pond'!!! Whole words are missing, capitals missing, punctuation missing... and this on every page.That said, Gibran is a beautiful writer, I have read this book a long time ago and wanted to read it again, it is very moving, very loving. I love all of Gibran's books that I have read so far. I will buy a different edition as this one was terrible and does not do the book justice.I wish Amazon would figure out a way to review books and editions separately..."
5,"Amazing, Heartbreaking, Astonishingly beautiful","10 years after my initial review, this book still resonates. The Broken Wings is a wildly hyptotic love story that will carve a special scar within the depths of your heart. Kahlil Gibran is a maestro of lyrical writing. His pieces are timeless. The Broken Wings should be a requirement for any student of philosophy, love, life."
3,Xmas gift,My sister and I get each other a worst christmas gift instead of serious ones and we make a contest out of it. While I'm sure this is helpful to some I am using it as a prank. Sorry to those who are fans.
2,"Lifeless, but faithful to the story","Kate Lock's homage to Tiffany Mitchell is a factually accurate rendering of Tiffany's life, in the form of a diary that was found by Bianca Butcher after Tiffany's death.We don't get to learn anything about Tiffany that we haven't already seen in the show (and that's a shame, because she sometimes came across as a a one-dimensional and shallow character).If you're watching EastEnders in Outer Mongolia or on some weird-and-wonderful US cable channel that's about five years out of date, you may want to buy the book to catch up on Tiffany's story, but beware the spoilers - it'll probably ruin everything for you!"
5,Award winner!,"This book was the recent recipient of the Purina Special Nutrition Award given at the annual Cat Writers Convention; Nov 21st, 1997."
4,"Bright and shiny, it is what it is.","We bought this mat to go on our countertop to sit beneath the coffee maker and coffee grinder. It's a generous size, and the shiny surface complements the Kitchen Aid appliances. We're happy with it's construction and appearance."
2,Frustrating and uninformative.,"Trying to struggle through this Newsweek article masquerading as a book is an incredibly frustrating experience. Instead of giving a clear sense of the issues at hand, it just drowns the reader in technical nonsense. I picked it up hoping to get a real sense of the comparative advantages of St. John's Wort vs. Prozac, but was left with no new understanding at all; just a true sense of how much useless information you can pile into a book without providing any insight whatsoever."
5,dutch oven,Wonderful dutch oven. Cooked Gumbo in it all day on low and it did a wonderful job with no sticking. Nicely seasoned.
4,Just love this CD...,"This album is an awful lot of fun...it's a crazy blend of genres that all work pretty well together. Granted, it may provoke images of cars and bootleg jeans, but I think we can get over that :) I think a lot of people bought this album looking for ""that song from the Mitsubishi commercial"", and the one on here (Groove Armada) probably isn't it - you want ""Start the Commotion"" by The Wiseguys, which you can buy here ..., incidentally (btw, their whole album is that good). Other than that, I'd definitely recommend it."
3,You friends will want this...,"Pop songs have a short shelf life. Yet many go by the wayside, never listened. Yet when a commercial blows serious decibles of life back inot these long lost songs, some of us get a musical epiphany. ""As Seen On TV"" is one of those CD's. Good mix of commerical favourites with a blend unique - for some.Buy it and your friends will want to dub it, garanteed!"
3,Oh come on...,"A good compilation of songs from commercials? Yes. A good compliation of songs from commercials that anyone with any taste would already know about and either own or have downloaded already? Also, yes. People, if you're using commercials to discover ""new"" music, you seriously need to turn off the radio, turn off the TV, spend some time in a record store, and realize that just because something is ""top 40"" doesn't mean it's good. So, 5 stars for whoever put a good bunch of songs together, one star for people who buy this just because the songs are in commercials."
5,Follows the actual examples of such prejudice rather than providing the usual overview of history,"IN HER PLACE: A DOCUMENTARY HISTORY OF PREJUDICE AGAINST WOMEN follows the actual examples of such prejudice rather than providing the usual overview of history: as such, it culls records from books, articles and scholarly monographs to provide evidence in dozens of works which document scorn and disrespect for women over the past two centuries. Don't expect to find the familiar here, either: much of the material has never been reprinted since its original publication and offers thinking from major members of the intellectual and social circles of their times for some major eye-openers.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,Interesting enough,"I just finished reading this book by Joy Fielding. It is definately not her best, but it was a nice quick book to read. I found that I was pretty interested in the story because unfortunately there are many incidences of infidelity in the world today. Basically we start out with Jill Plumley who is the second wife of David. She is approached at a company picnic by a younger pretty girl named Nicole who says that she is going to steal David away from Jill. Well, with that remark the tale begins. Jill had been a previously strong woman with a great career who fell in love with a married man and got him for her own. It tells about her insecurities to keep him and flashes back to their affair. And as in real life all too often, once a cheater, definately don't count him out to do it again. The only thing left is for Jill to decide what to do next.This was an easily read book, but by far not her best."
1,A badly written romantic novel,"This is a book I deeply regret ever buying. Please, don't make the same mistake! The author tries to follow a number of storylines at the same time and the result is shallow. Experiencing infidelity (as the wife or the 'other woman') is a shattering experience but this book failed miserably in conveying any of this. The only part where I really felt there was some emotion and not just words was when Beth told Jill about her marriage. I wish the author could have followed up on that part. I also liked the ending of the book but also there the author could have made a stronger impression. If you want to know how women feel, read 'Women's room' by Marilyn French. This is not much more than a romantic novel and not even a good one."
2,"MEOW! HISS, HISS!","The back biting, clawing and scratching leaves no one unscathed. Jill is back bitten, clawed and scratched by her husband's lover, Nicole. Both women back bite, claw and scratch each other. David's ex-wife is a barracuda extraordinaire who leaves nothing and no one in her path unharmed. Even Jill is a bit of a back biter, clawer and scratcher in that she was half of an extra marital affair couple when David was still married to the barracuda. David's anorexic daughter gets into the back biting, clawing and scratching by pitting the barracuda against Jill. Beth earns her stripes and her self respect by killing her abusive husband (David's partner) and learns the fine art of back biting, clawing and scratching. Put on your suit of armor -- this book is gritty. OUCH! (One hopes that nasty Nicole gets what she deserves -- a taste of her own back biting, clawing and scratching medicine. She truly was one hellcat)!"
2,DON'T LET THESE CATS OUT OF THE BAG!,"Jill, Nicole and Elaine are all masters of cat fighting. Jill and Nicole are at swords points because Nicole told Jill she was going to take David away from her. Elaine is David's first wife and is bitter over the divorce. She understandably resents Jill who had an affair with David prior to marrying him. Throw a sack over these cats -- they will leave their marks on you!"
3,Finally..darn fedx,Everything was perfect after it got ordered again and sent to me by UPS instead of fedx. Who lost the first book from Oakland to Fresno...
3,tipsy,"The gladiator is great for organizing, but you have to be careful what you put in them, can tip over to the front, not as stabel as we hoped. Also the picture is deceiving, are smaller than we expected. But overall the product worked for what we wanted."
5,"Handy, inexpensive","Love these. They're on the small side, but stack nicely and they're cheap. I plan on buying a few more. Recommended."
4,Good Bins but will not fit standard slatwalls,"I ordered these hoping they would fit on a standard slatwall but they don't.GearWall Panels apparently are narrower between slots.The bins work well for bench top use, I was just hoping to hang them on my slatwall."
4,Worked like a charm for me!,"Due to the addition of a new coffee-maker onto our small kitchen counter we needed to reclaim some space. These stackable bins allowed us to ""collect"" and store a lot of small items (sweetener packets, for example) without eating up a lot of space. Although kitchen use is not something you would normally think of when looking at these, I have to say that they have worked remarkably well in the limited space available."
4,Very Small,"Be sure you are looking for something that will hold a very small item. If you are looking to store something as long as a screwdriver, this is not it. These will store small items like nuts, bolts, screws... smaller objects. They are good for that. But just realize, they are small."
2,not my cup of tea,I just could not get into this book. I got to page 100 and couldn't force myself to read any further. The author writing syle just didn't appeal to me. It just didn't make the story belivable. I pass it on to a co-worker. Maybe she will like it.
3,A true lazy Gold Digger!!!,"This Gold Diggin chic got on my last D*mn nerve I was like baby girl stop gold digging so much and get a JOB!!! but I was very satisfied at the end because she got what she deserved and I did not feel sorry for her! Just because you meet a guy with hopes and dreams but no money does not mean thats how he will be forever, and baby girl got a big reality check."
3,Entertaining - mediocre read,"I liked this book because it depicted the main charcter's thoughts thoroughly (Jalita) and i really like how she was so confident and fun in a crazy way. It just gets to the point towards the middle of the book that I was like ""wow are you serious"". She just kinda starts to get on your nerves and I almost didint want to finish reading it. Although it kept me going for the first few days. I loved it at the beginning , but got tired of it . . if you want to read what a hoody-rat will do for money and how she thinks she has it all under control read this book. She is a crazy girl that really dont give a damn."
3,Decent Horror Flick,"Junior was actually a pretty good horror flick. I remember seeing the cover saying okay its by Artisian its musn't be that bad. Well I popped it in and the first 10 minutes were horrible. The diaglougue in the beginning was just awful and the acting as well. However, soon the movie started getting good. It seems to me that someone noticed that the movie was bad so far and decided to take this film actually seriously. So It got really good as it progressed. The diaglougue and acting turned out decent. It did copy some scenes from some other movies though. However one scene that they copied was from Friday The 13th. This scene was great because I haven't seen any other movie that copied the same scene before! The ending was decent too. All in All, Junior was a decent movie. It was heading in the wrong direction at first, but then turned into the right direction!"
1,I would rather clean an overflowed outhouse with my tongue,"The cover of this trash is deceiving, the killer in the movie looks nothing like what was on the cover. The cover actually looked kind of cool, but there was nothing cool about this movie. It tried to be scary but it failed big time. I realy enjoyed one scene in particular where a woman gets startled by an unseen thing, then she starts screaming, gets out of the car, runs to the edge of a fence, screams help me please at an oncoming vehicle, the people keep driving buy, so then the woman runs back to the car, Thus me naming her the smartest person in the world. This is just an example of new low budget horror movies. They don't try anymore. Please stop making them. I want to see good horror movies come back."
2,Junior.......,"My review: Not a good horror movie by any means. Oh, the box leads you to believe it will be but it's not! There is gore/blood which makes me give it a 2 star. In a nutshell-- 2 women go on a road trip and their car breaks down. Along comes a tow truck and they think they have been saved. Wrong. One woman gets killed and the other is left to face Junior..... a sad pathetic killer wearing a mask. We learn that it's junior's father that has made him this way. The remaining woman must fight to save her life. I'm glad I only rented this movie and didn't go out and buy it. I've seen worse but I've seen alot better!!"
2,"Good idea, disappointing movie! Turn up the TV!!!","I got this movie as a gift. I watched it about 2 months ago, and it was pretty disappointing. The movie has horrible sound, you have to turn your tv up full blast to even hear the darn thing! The scene where the one girl is in the car by herself with someone outside the car is ok, but a little silly too if you think about it! Some bad acting as well! The scene where the one passer-by says step on the gas, is absolutely horrible acting! Not an awful movie, but not really that good either!"
2,Downright goofy,"Unrecognizable accents in an unrecognizable location. Not even the stars know where they are. Sandra and Rebecca are friends. Really close ones. I mean to the point where I think it's a lesbian relationship. Unless they do things differently in Belgium (yes, I had to look it up). Their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, and things go south from there. I can't imagine the first hour of the movie is more than a few script pages. Just agonizingly long, pointless scenes. Until there's a big exposition scene with the father. From there, it gets a tad interesting, hence the extra star. ""Junior"" himself, for having brain damage, is really quite agile. Like the guy is a dancer or something."
1,Love The DVD Cover!...,"Two beautiful women have an automobile breakdown in the middle of nowhere. They split up (!!) so one of them can go to get help, allowing for tedious scenes of the other woman waiting. And waiting. Help arrives without the girl who went looking for it. The car gets fixed, only to break down again in an even more remote location. Mayhem ensues! JUNIOR is an inept, inhumanly dull affair. The title character is someone w/ his head wrapped in an ace bandage, wearing what appears to be the business end of a toilet-plunger stuck to his face. Do not let the semi-cool DVD cover fool you! I don't know who that is w/ the pick-axe and night-vision goggles, but he's NOT in the actual film! Yeccch!..."
1,This film is an abomination,"This is honestly the worst movie I've ever seen, and not in the good-bad way (you know, so bad it's funny.) It was just abmysmally awful. The acting was beyond terrible, the supposedly ""retarded"" villain sure doesn't walk and move like any mentally impaired person I've seen (how could someone with severe brain damage be that handy with a sickle?), and I didn't get a single good scare. The scenes just dragged pointlessly on and on. However, the ""plot"" was incredibly simple, so if they had made good use of their time the movie would have been about 15 minutes long. I can't think of a single redeeming feature in the entire thing."
1,Even the garbage man refused to pick this one up.,"That's right. Even the dump was too good of an area to throw this garbage away. Low budget, poor acting. Nothing good to write about this one."
4,Did the job,"The kit doesn't come with any connectors for the wires, so you'll need to go to your local electronics store and buy something to splice this harness into the car wiring. Other than that it worked fine."
2,"Audio ""Quality"" is horrible","This is a poor MONO recording - there are much better Ronnie Aldrich albums to buy on CD. Instead of this old recording, buy a ""Phase 4"" stereo from someone else. This is an ancient recording, and I only paid $2 for this CD on clearance - and now I know why. Ronnie is a great recording artist and his Phase 4 stereo LPs/CDs are excellent - but this is not a good investment, unless you want it for 'historical' purposes. Buy Ronnie's other music and you'll be better off. Best wishes for the holiday season!"
5,Art of the American West is beautiful,"Whether it's a mystical painting of thunder maidens or plain-song renditions of cowboys taking a coffee break or a sketch of a bull rider at a rodeo or a buffalo shedding its winter coat this book is like a window on that hot, sunny world of Cowboys & Indians, desert & animals, sunsets & rivers. A glorious gallery of the Great American West."
3,very hard to redeem a cheating hero,"It's seems that if the author wants to use a cheating hero it is very hard to redeem him. This one didn't do to bad. The only thing that saved him were the facts that when he and Celine entered into the marriage it wasn't a love match. Max was in love with his fiancee who had died and figured he would never love again. Celine was okay with that. Suddenly Max believes he is in love with another woman and wants out of this seemingly happy yet loveless marriage. Celine realizes that she loves Max and doesn't wish to let him go but feels that she needs to. Once you can get past the fact that you believe Max is old enough to know what love really is, since he claimed to love his former fiancee, it's not really a bad book at all!"
2,"close, but not close enough","It's not that Suicide is a bad album, because it isn't. But it's not a good album either. It's angry (""You're an idiot,"" repeated over & over in Dear Customer; ""East/West is the enemy,"" likewise chanted in the song named for that line) but that's about it. The songwriting is not as strong as on Superfriends and the creativity of their first album (Sweet Water) is missing huge chunks. It's almost as if Sweet Water has decided to become a punk band and let things like playing and songwriting fall by the wayside. Had Suicide been their second album, you would have heard critics everywhere talking about the sophomore slump; unfortunately this third album from Sweet Water fulfills that prophecy, just a bit late."
4,cute!,My only complaint is the cord is to short. My 15 month old can't reach his ear. otherwise he likes it alot. His favorite is the pop up dog
2,Not palyed with very much,My daughter got this because we hit a Vtech toy sale and this looked great. She hardly ever plays with it though. I thought she might grow into it and she is now 2 1/2 and still ignores it. I think it frustrated her that the cord is way too short and that it topples when it is pulled. Just not as fun as other phones that I have seen.
2,Spend your money elsewhere,Neither my boy or girl found this toy interesting. The cord is too short and that's the most important part! Buy something else instead.
5,Pull N Play Phone,"I think its Great, My Child loves it!!! Teaches him to count and know his numbers , has a few other things on it , I just think its Great all around"
5,9 month old loves it!,This is one of the only toys my son will play with. Nothing else holds his attention. We cut the cord off of the phone and placed it in his crib to occupy him for a little while in the mornings when he first wakes up. He enjoys all of the sounds that it makes. He has learned that it will make sounds/ring when he presses the buttons. My son can sit and play with his phone almost an hour before he tires of it. Seriously.
4,Great present,"My daughter received this as a gift last Christmas when she was 4 months. She didn't really play with it at that point, but when she was around 6 months she started pushing all the buttons and laughing when the music played. Now that she's almost a year, she has begun to carry it all over the house. I have discovered that toys made to pulled were also made for shorter kids. My daughter is too tall to pull any of the pull-along toys. Overall, I would say this an excellent toy."
3,Doesn't look like photo,"It doesn't look like Amazon's photo. I had to cut the cord because it kept geting trapped across my daughter's neck when she laid down on the floor. Now it's just a keypad. On a funny note, it keeps saying ""let me call my friends"" like it's trapped and sad lol. She likes the phone, so that's all that matters. Cut that cord though!"
5,son love this toy,my son likes this toy he plays with it all the time he got it when he was 1years old now he is 2 and still loves it. he really loves when the dog pops up and down. I would say buy this toy if you kid likes phones mine does. great toy for the price.
3,"Son loved it, I hated it","My son drug this thing around for weeks and just loved it. I, on the ohter hand, hated it. It was so loud and obnoxious that I tried in vain to pull the batteries out it. I am not real fond of noisy kid toys but I can tollerate most of them, not this one. I give it three stars because that is the average of what I rate it and what my son would rate it."
3,This is...,"This phone is the best toy I have ever observed, and yet at the very same time, the worst. I love it, but then again I hate it. I need it, but also I could do without it. It's as if this phone is a delicate flower, blossoming in my mind, as I decide whether it is good or bad. It's like a waffle, burning in the waffle iron, as I ponder on this most chillingly perplexing item. I feel as if I just want to hug this phone, and then smash it to the ground. Thank you for listening to my most interesting quandry."
4,Great toy used often,"We, my family and I, have had this toy for many years, through two children as a matter of fact, and it is still in great condition, despite being rammed up against the wall many times. Although the constant popping can get annoying at times, your child will love this toy and play with it often, sometimes much to your dismay. Even though my sister is almost two, she still loves this toy and can be seen, and especially heard, with it many times throughout the day."
3,good toy but cord is too short,"more fun and interesting compared to some of the other phones I looked at BUT I understand the saftey issue with the cord, I think they need a new design as w/ the short cord he walks around and carries the ph. by the string dropping on his toes instead of pulling as even the pull string is short has to walk right next to it and any taller forget it and he is only 12mo. I almost think I might tie string to it to make longer just so he will play w/ more. The earpiece he trys to hold to his head to pretend talk and is so short he isn't even interest in it as a ph. The only good thing is the sound we like that it plays music and goes over the #'s. I gave him my old ph. to play pretend with and he pulls that around the house."
4,Lots of Fun,My daughter got this phone as a birthday gift and she LOVES it. She loves the songs it plays the dog that pops up and the fact it is on wheels. The only problem is the cord is VERY short...prob. due to strangulation regulation therefore it is hard for them to get the phone to the ear...but we'd rather have a short cord instead of a long one if it will protect her.
2,Not that great...,"I rarely buy toys on a whim, but my son liked this at the store so I got it for him. I wish I'd bought a different phone, because now I see other brands which are better.My child does like it, but he likes anything with buttons and that makes noise. My complaints are, first of all, the sound quality isn't as good as Fisherprice or Leapfrog. It sounds like the phone is saying the word ""fans"" instead of ""friends.""Second of all, the dog doesn't pop very high. We barely notice it go up. I thought it would be cute, but it isn't.Last and worst of all, I can't really predict what sound it will make. I like, as a parent, to push a certain button and sing a song with my child. But this phone makes noises at random, which annoys me. I prefer this phone on the OFF mode.Overall, I was disappointed with this."
2,Annoying in more ways than one,"My daughter got this for her first birthday. She adores phones, but this one goes to the bottom of the toy pile. The cord is way too short. When she tries to put it next to her ears, the phone comes off the ground and hits her. The noise the phone makes is also very annoying. If I forget to turn off the sound, it will continue talking from the bottom of the toy box long after my daughter has discarded it. Most of the toys that she doesn't use anymore go into the charity pile, but I won't torture another mother or child with this one."
5,Great Italian Hardcore,"This is one of the finest punk albums to come out of the 80's,with frantic and some times indistinguishable lyrics. It is the thrid full lenght release from this dynamic outfit from Italy on Toxic Shock records from 1985. Absolutly worth it."
3,Good book -- pendantic,"This is a good compendium of statistics etc., and an excellent book for beginners -- especially those that have missed all the cover stories on China in BW, the Economist, Fortune and every other news magazine. But wait, how useful are these statistics in telling us about the real China? What is China really like once you get beyond the mirrors. Fishman never does. I recommend Haley's Chinese Tao of Business as a complement to this book, and to understand the ""real"" China -- if it really exists."
1,very ethnocentric book,"This book offended me. The author assumes that the United States holds the rightful position of global superpower, but as China threatens to topple our superiority, they are blamed for doing exactly what the U.S. has been doing overseas for decades. The author even went to the extent of making up a bunch of false scenarios at the beginning of the book - yes, that Chinese woman who is in the United States to work and whose daughter attends the same school as yours must surely be an evil creature, as must be the man who got Lasik surgery in China for 600 dollars.Don't waste your money on this book. I'm very sorry I bought it."
3,For a complete perspective on China....,"read the ""Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party"" - at www.english.epochtimes.com. A series of articles that explores the history of the CCP; first published in the Epoch Times - the most widely distributed Chinese language newspaper in the world. Since its publication in November 2004, over 2 million people have resigned from the CCP."
1,Another American myth,"I haven't actually read the book, but the title says it all...the author doesn't understand economics!Wealth is made by the ingenuity of the people who seek to produce better goods and services that would satisfy consumer demand.Ingenuity is sadly lacking in China, now, or ever. Look at any Chinese invention, and see its real development only when the Europeans got hold of it, from razor blades to paper money.Not convinced, look at patent production in China. It is eclipsed by most US states or European nations.Sorry, no sale."
5,This changed the way I think.,"Well written, meaty stories that tell the how & why China is what it is.Its a keeper, and I also bought several copies for friends."
2,A reference book for Studying China's rise,"This book is one of the must-read books for studying China's rise.This book has focuses more negative than positive elements of China's rise.As a professional reseacher, it is a must read; as a student, it might misleads."
3,Read this book to understand what's happening in the land of the dragon,"If you are interested in knowing what is happening in China and how it affects all of us, this book should be in your list of books to read. The book could have been better if the information was better organized with a better narrative. However for the uninitiated this book provides a good outsiders view of what is happening in current day China and how that is likely to impact the rest of the world."
4,Insightful!,"Squarely addressed to people with scant knowledge of China, this anecdotal excursion into the economics of the Middle Kingdom is dilettantish in the best sense of the word. Those who know China will learn only illustrative tales here, but those who do not know China will learn what even the most scrupulously accurate journalists cannot always convey: the feel of the place. Author Ted C. Fishman explores Shanghai shops, Shenzhen factories and markets for female companionship euphemistically known as karaoke halls, and he manages to put everything in the context of China's economic development. No doubt many readers will come away convinced that China is a threat - indeed, part of the author's purpose is to show how China challenges the world. He does that convincingly by alternating vignettes of China with vignettes of America. Critics may quibble, and not without reason, that the book is superficial, uncritical and nave. Granted. But we counter: it's a heck of a read."
3,"Reads like a list, not a narrative, and rather Sino-phobic","The author doesn't bother to vary his sentence structure and he uses few transitions. As a result, the book reads more like a long list of ways that China is changing, rather than an engaging narrative. I got both the book and, later, the audio book.In the audiobook, the author ends almost every sentence in a low bass voice, giving an ominous quality to every point. This contributes to the sense that he is trying to spook the reader into thinking that the Chinese are coming up the Hudson in their sanpans. Have they conquered America yet?Despite these drawbacks, it is a quick read, easy to find things, and a thorough list of changes that have taken place over the past 10-15 years. Just take the ominous tone with a grain of salt."
5,Focus on China,"This books offers a comprehensive overview of the China vs. World (Western / industrialized hemisphere) dynamics. Fishman intentionally does not get into the guessing game of Middle East/India factors in the equation but offers global trends that are relevant to everyone who is curious about the business world around them. What does it mean if a small fraction of Chinese can, or are willing, to do X? (Hint: a small fraction of one billion, in absolute terms, is an exceptionally large number of people nonetheless!) How will adding over a billion of people to the commercial world around us affect our lives and our countries? How can established companies make use of this new market?If you want to know why, and how, China has ascended into such a prominent place in our lives, this book is a good place to start. And if you liked it, or want a more detailed look on the dynamics of Globalization as a whole, take a look at Globalization and Its Discontents by Joseph Stiglitz."
3,Could have been at least 100 pages shorter,"A lot of insights from the book but at the same time a lot of non-insights.The book covers the movement of Chinese people from the farms to the cities and the attitude towards rapid modernization including piracy. However, you cannot FEEL it from first person point of view. You feel very detached reading the book.It could have been more straight to the point and a lot of pages bored me."
4,Wow!!! What an eye opener...,"This put the whole thing into prespective. Slow reading, but very interesting and very well presented"
3,Repetitive Repetititve Repetitive,"I'll admit that the first couple chapters are interesting as he speaks on migration of citizens to the cities and how they are financing their investments. Bulk of the book - only barely readable....so China is becoming a leader in manufacturing cars, cds, elecronics, etc.......what's new?"
5,See N Say Junior Musical Instruments,"Easy to handle, not too loud, great product, recommend all the small See N Say toys"
1,Misleading Description,"I was led to believe that I would be getting 25 folders per box, not ONE folder. This is not what I ordered at all. Shame on you, Amazon."
1,product title misleading,"The product title states ""Oxford ViewFolio Plus Twin Pocket Folder, 25 Count, Letter, Blue 57470"". There is not a count of 25, there is only 1 folder. I cannot believe I spent $6 for one folder!"
2,Not impressed,The item looks better in the photo than what you receive. The fur is horrible. I never wore it. Couldn't return it so I will donate it to Goodwill
5,Book Price,"This isn't so much a review as a comment...We got this book brand new for a wedding gift in 1993. The new price was $8.95. So now, 20 years later, a new copy is between $100 and $200??? That makes no sense."
5,Best Waffles we have tasted in a long time. Great selection.,"Have tried: Apple Spice Waffles, Orange Waffles, Vanilla waffles, Cinnamon Raisin, and Something with Pecans.Could not find a better book with waffle recipes ANYWHERE"
1,Rip Off Price :P,"Look up the harder to find ""Absolute Edition"" of Watchmen on Amazon. That's only going for $130. It's hardcover and includes a slip case and extras. Why would any re-seller charge $300+ for a paperback version.My 1 star review is only to prevent people from being ripped off here"
3,A good read,"A well-written, fun, quick romance book and for only .99 on the kindle, it was well worth the price. I enjoyed the setting and the characters, the storyline was fairly typical for a romance novel but was well written."
2,"A Text Book, Not a Beginner's Guide","If you order this book, you'll probably come away with the impression I did: these other reviewers are friendly with the author. There is nary a word of English instruction in this book, and it is almost impossible, to my eyes, for the beginning student of Hebrew or the novice to use it without formal instruction. This is a classroom textbook and a not a guide for for self-starters or at-home learners, so far as I can see."
3,"Great, but not for the faint of heart","This was my textbook in Israeli middle school. It's a good, complete book, but it's very hard to get through without a teacher or translator to make sure you understand the assignments and instructions."
1,Amazon sold this to me and I didn't order it.,"This is a bad item because even when you don't need it, don't want it, have never seen it, and don't order it, Amazon charges your credit card and sends it to you anyway."
4,Good selection of popular songs,"This is a good selection of songs. Some of the songs are traditional, but many are more recent songs from musicals, TV and movies. I remember a lot of these songs from watching Sesame Street growing up. The accompaniment varies in difficulty. The book is hard to keep open on a music stand."
5,This is NOT a review.,"Because Amazon will not allow customers to change the track listings on CDs, I here provide you with the actual listing for this version of Power, Corruption and Lies:1. Age of Consent2. We All Stand3. The Village4. 5865. Your Silent Face6. Ultraviolence7. Ecstacy8. Leave Me AloneThis is the original lineup on the album, which has since been overshadowed by the addition of the single ""Blue Monday"" for the stateside release. I have only heard the import, but the testimony of some New Order fans is enough to confirm my suspicion that it is superior to the American version. Then again, I only purchased this one because I was lucky enough to find a used copy at a lower price, and even then, it was not without a considerable inner debate."
5,Excellent material for self study,"I have bought few guitar theory books before finding out this one.None of them has done so well as Desi's material to convey the concepts of guitar theory. This book provides very clear picture of how scales, modes and progressions work together, along with easy-to follow methods for pattern visualization.In addition there are plenty of songs' references, which a very helpful for making the connection between the theory and practice.Now I definitely have a direction and clear goals with my guitar self-study."
5,Fretboard Theory,I have been using Fretboard Theory for the past one month and I must say my guitar playing skills have dramatically improved.I would not hesitate to recommend it to any guitar player who would like to take his guitar skills to the next level
4,Gap Filler,Desi Serna's Fretboard Theory was an information gap filler for me. Serna lays out the fretboard in a clear and concise way. This enabled me to apply what I knew about theory and the guitar to the music that I wanted to play. Serna presents useful information to the guitarist who is looking to make shapes and forms useful for creating music.
5,The BEST Theory Book,"I have been playing for years. I have looked at, or bought, every book on this earth that purports to be a guitar theory book. This is by far the bestI have learned more from you in 1 month than in the last 5 years. I encourage anyone who wants to understand guitar theory to invest in this book. It is the best investment you'll make to have your playing go to the next level."
4,Fretboard Theory,I have purchased several of Desi's books and have also downloaded all of his Songbook I & II on-line videos. I find the book very helpful in that it explains the fretboard in a manner I can understand without getting bogged down in detailed music theory. I would/will purchase other books from him in the future.
5,Fretboard Theory,"Being a 40 year player... This was a GREAT review for me.You don't realize how much you forget or don't use until you read this book.Young or old, veteran or novice....this is for you!Don't be too proud to admit what you don't know and pick this book up!Just AWESOME!Thanks again DesiBob Zurek"
5,Exactly what the doctor orderes,"Excellent book, precise and simple. The abstract concept of modes is not abstract anymore, for example.After so many years and so many books. This one make sense of the whole, and brings it home beautifully. Highly recommended"
5,Excellent book for intermediate guitarists,"This book is very well done. For many intermdiate players like myself, it provides the perfect bridge to get out of the rut of the same old songs and the standard pentatonic scale.I've been stuck for a while playing the same licks over and over because I wasn't sure where else to go on the fretboard. This book does the trick through teaching patterns for the scales and then related songs to reinforce the learning.I would strongly emphasize taking one's time on the first couple of chapters. Learn the patterns so well that you don't have to think about them."
5,It Keeps on Giving,"Fretboard Theory is a gem. The info is so accessible that I keep coming back to this book whenever I have a question about my playing. It refocuses your efforts and clarifies misunderstanding. Thanks to you, Desi, for putting in so much love and putting out such a valuable resource! I know I will be using Fretboard Theory for many years to come."
