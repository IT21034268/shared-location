5,Tomb of Horrors,An excellent module from the early days of D&D. A challenging scenario to play. This module ia not for the hack and slash player.
2,rough diamond,"I'm sorry to degrade something considered by many to be a classic, but I didn't really like this one at all... It is so obviously one of the earliest modules and it shows. Poor background (since it was a tournament module), far too many instances where the PC's are killed off without any saving throw, and the final assault on Acererak is just a bit too contrived. It's too much like an assortment of traps to cut high level characters down to size, loosely wrapped around a premise of the tomb of a lich. Worth hunting down for interest's sake, but would take a lot of tinkering to play in 2002 I think."
2,two star is being generous,"Despite what magazine, websites may try to tell you, this product is NOT for sensitive skin, just read the long list of ingredients on the bottle. It drives my face out like there's no tomorrow. The scent is pleasant but for the same category of cleansers, Aveda sensitive cleansing cream, in my opinion, is a much milder, better tolerated product."
2,A sad book.,"I liked the first half of this book, but towards the end things started to go terribly wrong. I began to feel terribly sorry for Genny, and even though I knew things were out of Alec's hands, his behavior to the end seemed inexcusable. Horribly mean. Didn't like it at all."
4,night storm,"not her best, but holds attention, this is again ""cookie cutter"" writing, i know books make money so make three instead of one, but it shows in this triology"
2,Not up to her standards.,Not very interesting to me. I was expecting much more but will stick to her other works on the FBI>
4,Great,Excellent book to read the author is great she makes it where you just dont want to put the book down
3,easy read,"Interesting plot. Could have been more story and less sex. I wish books had a rating system like movies, id rate this an r."
4,NIGHT STORM,"I am enthralled with this book! As with all three books in the Night Trilogy, I sincerely had a difficult time putting it down. The Trilogy has everything you look for in Catherine Coulter's books. Her imaginative expertise does not disappoint you here. For those of you who have never experienced Ms. Coulter's books, you've got to read the Night Trilogy. Also read her other books to experience a broader spectrum of her writing. Ms. Coulter is a diverse writer and I promise she won't disappoint you."
1,Dis-likeable Characters,"Unlike the other two books in the trilogy (Night Fire & Night Shadow) this book was way off course for me.It started out on the right track; but, seriously derailed.Alec, the leading man, had completely ungentlemanly, inappropriate behavior...even going so far as to rape (using oral sex as punishment) the leading lady, Genny. I started to detest his character. Alec was incredibly arrogant and sexist and a jerk to Genny for 95% of the novel. Poor Genny starts out as a independent woman, albeit a man-hater, and becomes a docile and domesticate creature. Totally disappointing.Even worse, I never felt like there was any significant turning point in their relationship; where I thought ""this is true love."" It's actually one of the first romance novels that made me wish the characters would not end up together :("
1,"This stinker beat ""Follies"" for Best Musical of the Year!","Need I say anymore. The score is dated and flat as was this show when I first saw it in the early '70's. And the fact that this show went on to capture that year's Tony Award over Sondheim's wonderful ""Follies"" is still one of the biggest mistakes in Broadway history. I just wonder why they ever bothered to release this on CD. The two record set originally produced was enough to gall while the Sondheim show got the abbreviated one record short shaft. Let these ""Two Gentlemen"" die in peace."
2,How Did This Win Best Musical of 1972?,"Based on Shakespeare's play, ""Two Gentlemen of Verona"" won the 1972 Tony for Best Musical over the more deserving ""Follies"" and crowd-pleaser ""Grease"".Best known for ""Hair"", Galt MacDermot's score does not contain any real musical ""standards"", but is highlighted by ""What Does A Lover Pack"", ""To Who It May Concern Me"", and the excellent, brass heavy ""Where's North"". Raul Julia (""Nine"") and Clifton Davis are fine as the male leads. The voices of the female leads, however, leave something to be desired.Possibly more ""brilliant"" during the time of its Broadway run ... this score just doesn't seem all that interesting in 2006."
5,A great hidden gem of the musical theater,"I was a very young kid when the first production of this musical came out[1971], so I missed it. Recently,this summer,at the Delacorte theater in Central Park [2005] there was a revival, so I went to see it out of curiosity. Not since ""Kiss Me Kate"" on Broadway have I enjoyed a musical and it's score ,mixing Shakespeare in the process. Thank goodness they recorded this original cast album. The score is jivey at times and is contemporary music [70's style],with a bit of wimsey.Here and there it reminds you of the score for ""Hair"", but Shakespeare is ever present.The songs ""I love my father"",""Thurio's samba"",and especially ""Night letter"" are great to listen to. They should revive this show back on Broadway. In the meantime, give this score a listen. I'm sure you would enjoy it."
4,It's about time!,"""Two Gentlemen of Verona"" was a great show, starring the late Raul Julia. Listening to this music again after many years, I must confess that not all of the songs impress me now as much as they did in 1971. But there ARE some fantastic tunes here, and the album recreates amazingly well the atmosphere of the live performance."
3,One Big Reason to Buy This,"This is a nostalgic favorite because my high school did a bfd production of it and man, was it fun. The score has some marvelous energy and a lot of silliness/camp. I bought this 20 years later and found that I pretty much still knew the whole thing by heart.OK. The vocals. The actresses playing Julia and Sylvia are awful, awful singers. Really bad. Which is a shame because most of Julia's songs are dynamite. Clifton Davis has a great voice and some fine opportunities to show it off. Full, warm, vibrant.Raul Julia. What a marvelous voice. The Perfect Broadway Voice. Huge, delicious, expressive, alive, sensual, with that undiluted accent. His charm is palpable here. Even the sillliest songs are full of wit and charm. I get the feeling he may have been the show stealer here.I bought it for some of the funky, brass-heavy arrangements and the heavy nostalgia element. I'd buy it again for Raul Julia's numbers."
2,Strait Out of the Box,"Before I purchased your item "" Strait Out of the Box "", you rated 99.9 percent in good condition, I don't remember you rated that 4 stars or 5 stars? but when I received the item, the box with George Strait photo on it is old, the CD boxes have many scratches and the couple CDs have couple scratches on them, but they work fine, of course I don't expect it is 100% perfect condition, but I don't agree you rated 99.9% good condition."
5,Buy this now!!!!,"One of the greatest country musicians of the last century. An amazing assortment of hits and favorites from 1981-1995 and even some cool rarities. The booklet has many great photos and George gives his commentary and tells stories about every song. Buy this boxset and then buy the CD ""Latest Greatest Straitest Hits"" which covers the years 1995-2000 and you'll have every hit you could ever want. I keep it inside the box as the 5th disc. Recommended very highly."
5,My man George ;),Got this when it first came out on cassettes...now i have it on my phone ;) George is always awesome!
3,If you have all of his albums...then don't bother.,"This collection is decent,but instead of having a bunch of singles and choice album cuts,I would have rather had a box full of unreleased outtakes that never made his previous albums,before this box set was released.There are a few rare tunes and a couple of outtakes on here,but there should have been more.I would have prefered them,over choice album cuts.Hopefully George Strait releases a box set soon that gives us a handful of tunes that he has had stuffed away in his vault for years,to give us a listen of what could have been.God bless Garth for doing this,with his ""Lost Sessions"" CD.Now George and Alan...let us hear YOUR unreleased gems."
5,"Buy This, now!","What can you say? Just about every single he's every released (and some that weren't) on 4 discs. You can't beat it.After listening to some songs, you'll want to get the original album, with all the other songs. And the amazing thing is in another 5 years he'll probably be able to put out another boxed set, with just as many good songs.George Strait is truly a legend in his own time, and anyone who likes real country music should buy this set. It's truly a blessing someone out there makes so much good music."
3,Not a dud,This book was really well put together. My favorite of all the stories was Robert Jordan's New Spring. It might be hard for people to understand if they do not read the other Wheel of Time books because they are very detailed. IT may be a good place to start though because it takes place before the series begins. It is not as good as the other books but it is still entertaining.
5,Phenomenal,"I bought this book (#3 only) as a Terry Prachett Fan. I have since bought Tad Williams's Trilogy,and all of the Jordan books. I was impressed by all 4 writers and have broadened my horizons in some fantastic fantasy books. This book is a great intro to modern fantasy wrting, for those who love Tolkein and haven't read anything new (like I was before reading this)."
1,Not a fan,Scent was too sweet and was not a fan....Sorry! Annick Goutal. You might want to try her Gardenia Passion instead.
2,Poor comfort,"I used to love Rockports, but this pair has turned me sour. The line across the rear of the toes box is so uncomfortable I may throw away the shoes (I've worn them for two long days at work to break them in hoping against hope. Not sure I can take the pain to try again."
2,not good.,"for the first I wear this shoes, after walking no more than 1000m, the heel port srubbed my heel, and get my heel peeling."
5,Que zapato!,"Desde que lo saque de la envoltura sabía que la compra había valido la pena, muy contento con el producto recibido."
5,"Great shoe, but Amazon sent me one wide shoe and one regular width","I LOVE these shoes, I have a lot of foot pain, arthritis from knee surgery and an old Achilles tendon injury. These shoes are stylish enough (for me) to wear with a suit or a dressy pair of jeans and be very comfortable. I need to wear wide widths and these have been the most comfortable dress shoe I've ever owned, and the first pair I bought wore very well.Back in March I ordered a new pair on Amazon, and I was uncomfortable from the start. I tried to break them in, but the pain in my left foot (side with knee issues and old Achille's injury) was so painful I could barely walk after a long work day. As the return period had passed, I put them away until recently. Upon close inspection, it turns out the right shoe is a wide width, but the left shoe was a regular width! No wonder I was in agony! Well, the return period has passed and it looks like Amazon messed up and really screwed me over...thanks."
2,Color was misleading,"I had to return these shoes. I ordered the Oxblood shoes but they were so dark they were practically black. Much,much darker than what was pictured or what they look like in stores."
3,Right instep hurts!,"The fit is fine. The sole is soft, but the right side hurts my instep allot. This was after about 4-5 days of use. It is likely because the shoe is a bit tight on the right side. I was disappointed in this, after seeing the many rave reviews about it. Since the initial first few days of wear, it has improved slightly, so maybe it is still ""breaking in"". Will update later on if I see any further improvement. The oxblood colour is just as I had hoped, and goes well with both brown and black pants."
3,A little disappointing,"Something doesn't seem quite right with these shoes, at least the pair that I wound up with.First, the uppers are quite stiff and unnaturally shiny. At least one other reviewer wrote that they look pleather-y and that was my reaction too. The labels do say leather, however.Second, the other thing that struck me right out of the box was a funky, unpleasant smell, like something rotten. It didn't seem excessive, but it might just have been me getting used to it. The shoes will stay out in circulating air for a few days to see what happens.On the plus side, the shoes aren't bad looking, minus the unnatural shine, and are certainly comfortable to wear. Still, I've had very good experiences with Rockports before and these are not quite what I came to expect."
3,"Works well, could fit better","I was wearing my last pair of Ellingwood Oxfords for over three years, until i was forced to toss them just by being completely shot and falling apart. It's not a perfect fit, however.When you first start wearing them, the shoe is slightly longer than the size would suggest. The extended toe ""cap"" can bend in and rub painfully on your toes, causing blisters. The solution that worked for me was to get ankle grips put in, which helps cushion the back of my foot, and soft insoles provide that extra padding to allow the toe-uppers to rest comfortably, rather than pressing in on my foot.It's a classy shoe, which I wear for dress occasions, but it is somewhat on the casual rather than formal look."
2,"looks good, had to return","too narrow for my feet but if it were to fit, has nice appearance for a waterproof shoetry it for size"
2,They didn't work for me,"They look nice. However, they didn't fit me well. I have wide feet and that's why I bought the XW (Extra Wide) size, but it still didn't work and wasn't comfy at all. I returned it."
4,As advertised,This is one of the few shoes that has been available in widths. It is true to size. It is comfortable and does keep out water and slush as advertised. This is my second pair.
2,Inaccurate Size,"Perhaps it's a mishap at the factory but the ""8.5"" that I ordered was easily an inch too large. This is strange considering the only reviews I could find about size were positive. All the same I'll have to return them. I have size 8.5 or 9 shoes from many brands (penguin, timberland, puma, sketchers, etc.) so I thought I'd be safe ordering this shoe through Amazon. Oh well, guess who's paying the return fee."
4,Good light-weight shoes,"I've worn Rockports for years. They're lightweight shoes, with rubber-soles, and comfortable to wear and walk in. These are no exception. I've found that with other brands that the shoes tend to be heavier and more tiring to wear. I also like the rubber soles because they're less likely to slip on wet pavement or rugs.The inner sole used to be a bit more comfortable, but it's still good. I'll often wear them on casual Friday's with blue-jeans because unless I'm biking or hiking I like walking in them."
3,Not a Good Fit,"These shoes are heavy for a Rockport shoe, which are know to be very light. These shoes feel like a normal shoe in weight. They fit small and tight. I had to return them and was dissapointed to have been charged for the return shipping. the size descrepency was not my doing."
1,Very disappointed..,"I have been a Rockport fan for many years, and ordered these along with a pair of Allander Plain Toe Oxfords. I returned both pairs immediately. The quality was awful. I have no idea what kind of material these shoes were made of, but it certainly did NOT seem like leather. I was disappointed because I have finally worn out a pair of Rockport oxfords that I bought a few years ago and was hoping to find a replacement. They do NOT make them like they used to...not even close. Save yur time and your money and buy something else..."
4,"good shoe, needed breaking in.","Out of the box, the shoe was not as comfortable as I was expecting when I walked. But it seemed to fit and after a couple weeks is now very comfortable."
3,Good Looking but Uncomfortable,"When I first got them I thought I got a great deal because they looked so great. The first time I wore them for two hours I recieved blisters, but I thought that was just because I had to break them in. No luck still"
5,A very devoted lady,"I met the author a few times and was in awe of her devotion and energy. Her writing is very sincere, and gives you the feeling that you really are with her, sharing her experiences. My husband and I enjoyed the book and found it to be most inspirational."
5,Never heard of Michael Hurley until three weeks ago.,Heard Michael Hurley's Blueberry Wine CD being reviewed on National Public Radio and thought I'd give it a try. I've been playing it nonstop for about a week and a half now. Very simple acoustic guitar playing but a mesmerizing voice. I may purchase another one of his CD's.
5,Definitely part of your essential Gospel collection,"Listen up: I'm not playing.I can't do anything less than surrender the 5 stars!This is the only time in my lifespan that I have ever been so intrigued, impressed and blessed by a Gospel artist. Integrity, a clear message, vision, ministry, entertainment, praise, class, generational relevance from teens to the more chronologically gifted, sincerity (this guy responds to e-mail!). He knows the balance between having fun and taking his faith seriuosly, while celebrating who God has made him.To keep it simple: He's straight funky, and the only way to understand his music and why it sets the tone for the next generation of music is to sit down and listen. Bless yourself this one time: it's OK!An asset to the Body of Christ - support him in prayer!God Bless your ministry, Tonex!"
4,disappointed customer,"Praise the Lord, Tonex!!!!I really love the CD but, their is one thingthat really upset me. On the track Make Me Right, why is that song very very short!! I really love that song!! Please, Please, Make It Longer!!!I would very much appreciate it. Thank you. God Bless.Sis.Vanessa, Michigan"
2,Nothing Special,"There is nothing special about this ""book"". ""Book"" is in quotes because ""The Perfect Legal Resume"" is more like a glorified pamphlet that does not look professionally bound.The content is okay. Generally, the ""book"" lays out some different types of legal resumes, which may be helpful if you don't already have a resume and are lacking direction. Otherwise, if you already have a resume and are looking for something that can substantially improve what you already have, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
5,Great movie!!,I'm not a big fan of westerns but I loved this movie. John Cusack was awesome in his role. I would recommend this film to anyone.
3,better than most,"I like Westerns and thought that this was average. It was made for TV, so the story seems too drawn out in parts."
4,The Jack Bull - A lesson in Justice in the untamed West,"During this time period,the West was lacking in justice for the little man or one without money and power in politics. It showed the extent one man is willing to go in order to see justice done. John Cusack is excellent in his role of Merl. I don't recall seeing him play such a serious character in any film. John Goodman plays a just man, one I was sorry that Cusack's character couldn't have met up with sooner.The formation of the early West was a brutal land, and many men died for what they believed in, whether over land wars, Indian issues or justice. I will recommend this movie to anyone, not just because of the moral issues involved, but because it's a story that needs telling, fiction or not."
4,Good but Lacking,"If your looking for a realistic western than this is the best you can do. No epic bloodshed(as with spaghetti westerns)and no overly macho heroes(typical american westerns). This film is about and is based on a true story and its one of the only movies I know of that doesnt take its ""artistic license"" too far. This movie keeps its realistic edge while still managing to entertain. That being said, its also a sad movie that leaves you with an empty used feeling at the end. Watching a movie and feeling worse than you did when starting it is in my opinion the mark of a film that has too much of a downward slope. Anyways do not highly reccomend to anybody unless they want a realistic movie that will make you feel sad and used."
2,Not very good western,This was not one of our favorite Westerns.I don't reccomend it. It won't stay in our library.Be your own judge.
4,John Cusack Western,"John Cusack always seems to play intriguing characters. In this movie he plays the lead character,John ""Bull,"" who is stubborn and proud. When a bullying rancher treats him badly, these characteristics lead John Bull into trouble. The movie has many good lessons, but I found it hard to watch at times as I didn't agree with the actions of the main character and wanted him to handle his problems differently. All in all a good movie, but not always enjoyable."
4,Entertaining authentic era western,Entertaining movie with an authentic realism to the settings and politics. A conflict of justice and injustice.
4,THE WESTERN FRONTIER AS IT REALLY WAS,"THE JACK BULL IS A SUPERB MOVIE THAT CAPTURES ALL THE FLAVOR OF OUR 19TH CENTURY WESTERN FRONTIER - ITS REALISTIC ATMOSPHERE TRANSPORTS YOU BACK TO THE GRITTY WEST OF "" UNFORGIVEN "" - A GREAT STORY , WITH A GREAT OBJECT LESSON ! -- I HAVE THE FEELING I HAVE SEEN THIS EXACT SAME PLOT IN ANOTHER MOVIE EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THE REVIEWS MAKE MENTION OF THIS, IF ANYONE CAN COME UP WITH THIS ELUSIVE TITLE PLEASE EMAIL ME AT SYZYGY1818@AOL.COM"
3,"Jack Bull, not wonderful","Bought this movie mostly because I usually like anything John Cusack is in. Wrong!! I understand that this movie was based on true life, but it left me feeling very depressed. There was a lot of violence in it too. Guess I must learn not to pay attention to how other folks rate it. Also may be because I'm advancing in years and just don't like violence at all."
3,"Handsome horses, principled cowboys, nice backdrop","This is a good basic western based on a true story. I don't know why it just isn't any better, Cusack is good, the other actors are decent but it just doesn't take off.Calgary is beautiful but the film just drags in the middle."
4,The Jack Bull: A good TV movie,"HBO did a good job making this movie. Actors such as John Cusack and John Goodman add a seriousness and flavor that might not be brought out by anyone else. Both Johns are supported by a very able cast and a wonderful script by Cusack's father, Bill. Directed by John Badham, who makes great use of the scenery, compels watchers back to turn of the century Wyoming territory. But the grit on the actors and the harshness of the conditions portray a reality that could easily been lost by less competent hands."
4,A great unknown film,This is an outstanding film. I cannot believe that it is not better known. I have always liked John Cusack but was unaware that he was this good of an actor. Never thought of him as a rugged he-man type but he plays a good one. This is not only a great western but a great film in general that would appeal to almost anyone. L.Q. Jones is great as a mean S.O.B. Where has he been hiding? Highly recommended.
5,The cold truth of the way things were,"Great movie, sad but great. Not many have the courage anymore to stand up for their values and what they think is right! Movie arrived quickly and in excellent condition."
4,Saiyuki Requiem,This movie was very good. It continues the feel of the anime. All your favorite characters appear including Kougaiji and his crew.I do feel that the villian in this movie however was a bit pathetic and they could of done more with him.Overall though I am satisfied with this movie as I am a fan of the series and adore anything pertaining to Saiyuki.
5,Excellent,"If you're into the Saiyuki series, then Requiem is definitely worth seeing. A lot of times when anime movies get dubbed, they'll get new voice actors, but for Requiem they kept the same cast as before, so it was easy to stomach on that alone. Plot-wise, it was excellent as it integrated elements from the original story so that it was an addition to the series instead of its own little subplot. 10/10"
4,Great movie!,I LOVE this series and the movie was great. I love the fight scenes and the way the characters interact with each other. It's a movie I will watch again and again.
5,Perfect for my new kitchen!,These are great and really look sharp with my new kitchen appliances. I use one for lotion and one for soap.
5,Great value!,I purchased these to plug two holes remaining in a stainless sink after installing a single hole faucet. These were not much more expensive than a simple plug and now we have soap and lotion available.
1,junk,This soap dispenser broke within 2 months of use. It loses it's prime and no longer pumps at all. I threw it away and replaced it with a better quality soap dispenser.
4,"Looks nice, Not Big or Heavy Duty",I've been using this in my kitchen for several months now. It looks very nice and works fine. It is smaller than I though it would be at first and everything other than the very outside is made of plastic and is a little cheap. I have this pumping soap from a big bottle underneath my sink and I had to thin out the soap a little with water in order for this dispenser to pull it up the tube from the bottle.Still it looks nice and has already lasted longer than the more expensive one I bought at the hardware store so I am giving four stars.
1,Do Not Buy This Book!,"My Kindle is perfect for reading books thru from point A to point Z, without much need for navigation. Obviously a phrase book is one that you want to consult at any point as quickly as possible. I find this impossible on Kindle. In addition, this particular book, altho its content is fine, suffers from poor layout and non-uniform typeface sizes that on some pages cannot be scaled up or down. Save your money and buy a hardcopy phrasebook."
3,A decent beginner's transliterated dictionary,"The Thai in this dictionary is transliterated into Roman characters, the Thai alphabet is not used in this dictionary. The transliteration scheme is easy to learn quickly, and the tone markers are among the most transparent I've ever seen. There are decent grammar and phrasebook sections. The dictionary itself is somewhat skimpy ~800 Thai to English entries and ~1700 English to Thai entries."
3,This book is a good bargain,"I teach Thai international students English for academic purposes (TOEFL). When I first purchased this book long ago i attempted to use the phrases with Thai people. I have found many mistakes and misprounciations. My Thai students and instructors in Thailand have pointed out that many phrases in this book are too long and do not reflect the tonal and voice reflections. This would make it possible for a person to say: You are my dog, instead of: You are my friend. For the money, I would say this is the best book for the english speaking beginner or casual traveler. But beware the information is not always accurate and leaves much to be desired in in correct pronounciation."
5,Well made and easy to clean cage!,"I am very impressed with my Midwest Ferret Nation Single-Level cage. It's very heavy duty and extremely easy to clean. I've got one ferret and there is plenty of space for her to play, sleep, eat, and use her litter pan...I got this cage because I thought it would blend into my homes' decor and I was right. It has a green/black tint to it and looks very nice on my wood floors.I'd reccomend this cage to anyone looking for a decent sized home that is easy to clean for their ferrets!"
4,Ferret Cage,Prompt shipment.Midwest 142 Ferret Nation Double-Level Ferret Cage with RampsAssembly instructions-OK. Quality of product-good. Disappointed in platform-expected metal base. It was a laminated piece of cardboard.
3,"Well written, with a few problems","I would have rated this book as great, but:1 - Why in the name of everything that is good and wholesome would anyone use imperial units when writing about physics?2 - The code in the examples is appallingly bad. There are abundant global variables, poor comments etc..."
2,"Quite comprehensive, but has some flaws","This book had a few disappointments. The biggest was that it uses imperial units for everything (prepare for feet per second, pounds per square inch, etc). It could be improved a hundredfold by using normal SI metric units.The second was possibly more an issue of having the wrong expectations of the book. Although it discusses issues such as collision response (the actual physics), it does not describe the actual collision detection.The examples in this book are all written for the Windows API, rather than using a cross-platform API such as SDL. As a result, they cannot be compiled on Linux or any other platform (eg. MacOS X).At times I felt that it was too mathematically oriented. It would do better if it explained the techniques in source code more often. Sometimes I wondered if it was really just a mechanics textbook trying to be something more."
3,Very lacking,"This book didn't even come close to meeting my expectations. The text does not go very deep into any of the topics covered. Many of the chapters are extremely short, for example the chapter on ""Cars"" is only 4 pages long. A lot of the problems discussed are not fully developed. For instance, projectile motion is presented in a non-elegant manner, and some problems like the cylinder rolling down an incline don't give a clean solution. I found Lengyel's book to give these particular problems a much more thorough and accurate treatment, and the main focus of that book isn't even physics."
5,Excellent game physics for beginners,"I read this book to bone up on the basis principles of physics, and to understand how they applied in a general sense to computer games. An excellent primer, but as other reviewers here have noted, it will not sufice as a complete tool kit for experienced programmers."
4,Nice refresher with basic application in games,"Even if you haven't taken physics, this does give you a nice overview of the science. Everything is covered with the idea that it can be used in games. Naturally there is math involved, but nothing overwhelming. Overall, I found that this can be pretty helpful as a side reference, but it doesn't offer anything ground breaking. Naturally, there isn't much in physics that you can't learn from school...but a lot of people have problems learning physics from school anyway."
2,feet per second per second?,"While mathematically a good start and interesting in places. The book has one major failing point. (Not counting the completely black image of black particles on a black background.)The US, Burma (or whatever they demand we call it this year) and Libya are the only places where such cryptic units as *slugs*, feet, pounds, mi/h and psi are used.If you think in Metric, like most of the world, you will be wondering why you wasted your money on this book."
2,A Sinking Feeling,"Much of Mudville was cute and fun, and the author/Little League manager clearly loves his son. But I had to wonder about the kids on the team who didn't get a lot of playing time -- they didn't get much book time either. I also thought that the author got a little too hung up on winning. The whole thing made me wish that the author, instead plotting out winning lineups and agonizing over pitching rotations, just would have rotated the kids through every position and given them equal playing time. But that would have been too...fair?"
4,User friendly!,"This book is the best intro to the subject that I've seen. The authors minimize the use of notation, mathematics and the like, and invoke the reader's intuition by developing some good, concrete examples. They present those examples as datasets (accessible on the web), as ""run"" regressions (i.e. with parameter estimates and standard errors), and graphically.They also demo how to ""run"" each of the examples on a PC, using the program MLn. If you don't use MLn (and I had never heard of it); this part of the book is less helpful. It would be great if, in an accompanying website perhaps, they were to demo the same analyses using other packages (e.g. SYSTAT, SAS and the like). But this book is really quite good, and a terrific addition to any applied social scientist's library."
4,"Good intro Multilevel modeling - uses ""Englishlike"" language","I liked the ""comman-man-language"" used by the authors to explain Multilevel Modeling. The use of MLn software, which is nearly 50% of the book, was a damper. With the commercial world dominated by SAS and SPSS, I would have liked the authors to give the examples for use with SAS"
3,success and the milking of it.,"The first chapter of the book, which was re-printed from her published article in The New York Times, was excellent. The remaining dozen or so chapters, with a clever turn of phrase here and there, were not even interesting as padding. I read through to the end thinking she would eventually explain the cryptic title: she never does. The first chapter was great, but I think the author suckered the public into purchasing a book when she had only a magazine article to offer."
5,Wise and Compassionate...,"Writing Past Dark Envy,Fear,Distraction and Other Dilemmas in the Writers LifeWho would imagine a book ABOUT writing being such a wise and compassionate ""gift"" to writers ANDeven to (only) readers that everytime I loan it out I have to purchase another copy?!"
1,Not worth the price,"I was very disappointed with the Ironman Speed Jump Rope. It is made of cheap plastic and, even after a month of hanging from my 2nd floor banister with a weight on the end, it's still coiled and kinked. It's impossible to jump with it as you never know when one of the kinks will bump the bottom of your foot. I would not buy it again, even for the low price charged by Amazon."
3,good kringle but excessive shipping cost,"I sent this to relatives who are quite fond of this Wisconsin treat - as I am myself. They said it was good, but I found the shipping cost too high. The cheap price draws you in but the shipping is too much."
2,Flimsy,"The snaps undo themselves if you move it around much, and when picking up by the handles (when full) feels as if they'll rip right off - haven't yet. Box top is larger than bottom. The metal file holders are already starting to bend out of shape. I recommend a standard cardboard banker's box instead."
4,Deeply disturbing,"I very much enjoy the Merrily Watkins series of books and this is as well written as the others. I found the subject matter very disturbing though, and it is definitely the stuff nightmares are made of. You end up caring deeply for the characters, a couple of them in particular, and Rickman has a way of making you identify with their fears and griefs, even though you have never been in their particular situation."
4,Very useful for advanced Spanish classes,"I have used this book for one semester in Advanced composition and conversation, though I have been using some of its exercises and suggestions for years before I decided it was going to be a required book. I find the articles very well chosen, most of them elicit a lot of discussion and the cultural topics are both varied and interesting, with enough detail to make the students ask questions and remember things. The discussion activities are also very creative. I also like its emphasis on vocabulary that causes problems to English speakers. However, if you are looking for a grammar book this is definitely not it. It does have a companion workbook that includes a grammar review and exercises."
2,"A good book, but without a defined purpose.","Some books serve to improve grammar, others to improve reading comprehension, and yet others to teach spanish culture. This book, however tries to tackle so many different topics that it is not able to do any one of them very well. each chapter is divided into parts. many of the vocabulary words are things that a student at that level already ought to know. there is little taught about grammar in this book, however the workbook touches on some subjects, but only the easy ones. i would not recommend this book for a spanish class."
3,Definitely a Used Book,"Book had lots of writing on the pages, but was in otherwise readable condition. Not sure if I would be able to sell this book again after using it for class. Book was received promptly."
2,A big collector can afford to miss this one...,"I'm a huge R+ fan. I have all singles, all records, couple t-shirts, stickers, tons of bootlegs, [the works]. I'm starting to recognize a trend in Rammstein singles: using old songs to fill in the track-listing... Du hast & Bueck dich !? Give me a break. They've been packaged with too many singles already.There's three decent tracks on here (the obvious). If you're new to Rammstein, this will give you a great hit, two decent mixes, and two ... tracks from a few years ago. Even for an avid collector like me, well... the scarcity of NEW material (like with many R+ singles) is not worth the list price plus S&H.;Let me re-phrase that all:If you're a R+ newbie: This will be a good starter.If you're a fan: DON'T GET IT, you can live without 2 remixes."
2,"Reflective of it's time, I guess","Mediocrity was pretty much the order of the day on the singles chart in 1978, and this collection pretty much reflects such. Raydio's ""Jack and Jill,"" and A Taste of Honey's ""Boogie Ooggie Ooggie"" are the only flat out stinkers here and at the other end of the spectrum Patti Smith's ""Because the Night"" is the only ture gem. Nothing else here is essential, although both Paul Davis's ""I Go Crazy,"" and Bob Welch's ""Sentimental Lady"" add a little pleasant counterweight to this otherwise disco heavy collection. Missing from this disc are ""Just What I Needed"" and ""My Best Friend's Girl"" from The Cars, and Gerry Rafferty's ""Baker Street"" which spent 6 weeks peaking at #2 in the summer of 1978."
2,Misleading,The dress is okay. However the tiara is a piece of crap. This is not worth the [...] we paid. Please either buy this for cheaper or do not buy it. I feel the picture is very misleading. The crown does not look like the picture.
1,Where's the deluxe?,"I had to have the sleeves altered as they did not fit an adult, they fit my 9 year old son and the tiara was such garbage I threw it out and use my wedding tiara instead. If you feel like paying extra on top of the costume/shipping costs then this isn't so bad- otherwise, buy something else."
5,amazing,when i take it and give it for my wife she was looking like prince on my eyes .. she was more beautiful.
4,good sound,"This a very good cd, not the favorite . was a gift,however is good. very good service with grt service. thankj you"
1,NOW MY EARS ARE BLEEDING,"I thought this band would be as good as they claim to be. NOT SO. This has got to be one of the WORST bands I have ever heard and I'm a fan of metal. The guitars are extremely wimpy sounding, the vocals are boring and lacking.Do yourself a huge favor and don't waste your money on this poor excuse for a band. I'm sorry I did!"
4,Nice chewy salmon jerkey.,"I began buying salmon jerky after a trip to Canada a few years back. This salmon jerky is indeed chewy, so I would only recommend it to people having nice jaw muscles and enjoying chewing. For me, 20 minutes after receiving it, I already finished almost half a pack with no problem.Interestingly, after reading 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy, I started to have the urge to have some non-perishable food at hand. But this is just a tasty snack in my opinion. It will not last you through the seemingly endless nuclear winter. The $10 discount code for $50 Grocery purchase makes it tastier for sure."
5,Great healthy salmon jerky.,Great fish jerky for fish lovers. I'm from Russia and us Russians eat a lot of salmon Jerky back home so when I came to the states I had to find fish jerky here in the US and that's when I came across snackmasters brand. The salmon jerky tastes great and is always fresh!
1,very disappointed,"I have ordered the SnackMasters Salmon Jerky a number of times and have never been disappointed with the quality. Until today, my co-workers and I like to have a little salty treat in our otherwise very sugary snack station, so I have taken to ordering the jerky. When the shipment arrived today we expected the same as we have had before, only this time it was AWFUL. I have read others reviews stating the jerky was hard as a rock and thought they exaggerated for effect, I learned today they are not. This will be the last time I order this product and I would hope that Amazon would take to providing a little better quality control on items like this. It's all fun and games `til someone loses a tooth."
2,wont buy again,its ok ..i was disappointed with the texture and strong smell. will try other brands - probably wont get this one againi bought in bulk because i have had this brand before and it was great..now i wish i could get rid of the overstock of hard to eat stinky fish jerky
2,Bold and Mold,"I admittedly liked this product. People thinking ""I like smoked salmon"" may be thrown by this product at first, but think ""jerky!!"" Very chewy: the larger pieces can give your jaw a good workout, and every once in awhile you hit a peppercorn which makes your eyes water (in a good way). Good salmon flavor. I would be a happy consumer except that I have run into moldy strips in two separate orders. Got the 8 pak, and on pak #6, almost the entire contents were fuzzy. An e-mail to the company got absolutely no response, but Amazon was kind enough to replace it in spite of it being a generally non-returnable item. Unfortunately, the replacement jerky also had a white fuzzy mold pocket in one pak. Not in every pak, but since you tend to chew jerky while busy doing something else (fishing, driving, whatever), it gave me the creeps knowing how little I looked at most of this stuff when shoving a strip ""in between my cheek and gum."" Eat in good light and keep your eyes open."
1,Terrible.,"This salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough, it is pretty much inedible. And when you do painstakingly gnaw on it, it doesn't release much flavor, but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth. I had the misfortune of ordering this, and 7 of the 8 bags are still untouched, and I'm not sure what to do with them. I even tried soaking the jerky, and tried boiling it with some macaroni, and NOTHING seems to soften this stuff up! What a waste of money. Go for some beef jerky instead, and if you need salmon, eat it fresh or canned. This product is a joke."
1,Stale,"I bought both the Ahi Tuna Jerky and Salmon Jerky. Both were dried out and brittle. Absolutely the worst.Incredibly, the Salmon Jerky was worse (i.e., drier, harder) than the Ahi Tuna Jerky."
4,Salmon anyone?,"This California style salmon jerky tastes great, but a little overly dry and hard to chew, in my opinion. Still it is nice to have, and it is very funny to see looks on people faces when you offer them salmon, somewhere on a trip in the middle of nowhere."
1,Used to be good,I've ordered salmon jerky from Snackmasters before and really liked their product but it was a couple years ago. I recently ordered a package from them again. The jerky was so hard it was like chewing leather. I don't mind my jerky on the harder side but my jaw hurt after a couple pieces. I also found fish bones in my jerky which I think is unacceptable especially for the cost of the product.
1,bad. really bad.,"I ordered turkey jery from snackmasters and liked it so wanted to give this a try. really hard, almost inedible. won't ever purchase it again."
1,Mold in more than half of packages,I love this product but I usually buy it in stores and can see the jerky. In this pack of 8 at least 4 of them had jerky covered in green mold. I had opened the packages and then saw the mold each time. I didn't feel like I could return them but just think the company should make sure before they send moldy jerky next time.
3,Not as tough as I expected.,"I went with this particular grip strengthener because it looked like it would last me a while with it's adjust ability. I read the reviews of pretty much all the options available on Amazon and this looked to be the best. Boy was I wrong. I don't consider myself to be ""strong"" but this handgrip was a little too easy for me even on its highest setting. The only way to make it more difficult is to spread my hand further apart and use my fingertips instead. The fact that it is easily adjustable really doesn't factor in to its value for me because it really is only good on its highest setting. Had I known this, I would have probably purchased a non-adjustable more difficult handgrip. It's one of the better products available on Amazon, but I would only recommend this for absolute beginners."
4,Better than standard handgrips...still needs more power,"I like the adjustable feature, and the grip feels more ergonomic than regular nonadjustable handgrips. However, it could use more power."
4,Very good,it's work very good.Not so strong as i thought but in a cycle training it's work like hell.Prescribed
2,"This album is awful, straight garbage","... This album was a huge disappointment because nature is a good rapper. His production so weak it reminds me of cannibus' album. The flows are terrible, it doesnt even sound like they on beat. I would gave it a 1 but nature is to talented for that. He didnt even put his response to NAS on this album. Should have signed with a better label. Save your money for real."
1,Disappointing,"While the subject matter is fascinating, the book itself is in serious need of tighter editing. In fact, I got so frustrated with the author's disjointed writing style (it jumps all over the place) that I could only make it through half of the book. Every time I go back to the book to attempt to finish it, I'm quickly reminded why I couldn't finish it in the first place.I really want to like this book, but its lack of a coherent structure prevents me from recommending it. I have found that other books from this particular publisher (McFarland) would benefit from more aggressive editing."
3,"Considering the price, not bad.","Assembly: Easy. Nine screws and some plastic caps. Looked at the instructions for about 10 seconds, and completely erected it in 5 minutes.Stability: Mediocre. Its legs are wider than its arms so it'll hold a lot of weight, but the base is lighter than the top so its already top heavy without anything on it. The pole is in three sections which loosely slide together and that is the main reason it wobbles. I recommend spreading out your coats strategically to balance the weight...or anchor the legs down to the floor somehow. Definitely NOT baby friendly.Value: You get what you pay for. I paid for a cheap coat rack and thats what I got.Looks: Good. Satin black finish with black screws looks nice.I have it sitting in my office holding my hard hats and jackets. Works as expected. A little wobble but it was cheap so I don't mind. Good luck!"
4,Modern Style Black Finish Metal Eight Hook Coat Hat Rack,"The coat rack it OK. The price is right.I haven't loaded it down much at all.Just from an observation standpoint, the feet do not have a big enough foot printto hold much weight unless it was balanced out between the hooks. Just anobservation however, like I said I have not loaded it down."
3,quality matched the low price,I like the way this looks and it was super easy to put together but there is nothing to actually hold it together. It just slides together with no clips or rods so it is on the flimsy side.
4,Its worth the money,"I am a college student and needed a place to hang my winter jackets. I found this and compared it to others. I took a chance after reading all the other reviews about how crappy it was. Honestly speaking, for its price, it does its job. Yeah, it takes a little adjusting the jackets, but whatever."
5,Great Buy,"I couldn't have asked for any better from a coat rack for this price. The black metal is very sleek looking and the rack itself was fairly simple to put together. Most importantly, you'd have to be trying pretty hard to get this thing to tip over (i.e. putting several heavy coats/purses on one side)."
1,? no manual ?,This product came w/o an assembly manual (except for dusting instructions). I would not normally consider that a problem except I can't figure out how to install coat holder arms? Can anyone help?There do not appear to be any places on the central cylinder to put arms on. I did receive bolts and the arms themselves appear to have little indentations???Any help appreciated. Email; smithwmg1@comcast.net
5,"Excellent coat tree: sturdy, modern, sleek","I ordered this coat tree for entryway in our house, and it's perfect. For such a low price, this item is a winner. Its clean lines, and 8 useful hooks are the perfect answer to lack of a coat closet, and it's very sturdy. Takes less than 10 minutes to set up. After looking at several choices for coat trees(wood and metal) this is by far the best product for design and usefulness I could have chosen. Buy it--look no further!"
3,It does what it's suppose to do,"it's a coat hanger, it does exactly what it was designed to do, keep stuff off the floor and available to grab."
1,does not work,very poor materials! do not buy it! It was difficult to collect because of the different sizes and poorly made parts
1,crap,"it broke, don't waste your money on this one, didn't have it for very long very disappointed in this product"
2,"Nice coat rack, took forever to arrive","The coat rack was nice. Everything was included and it was simple to put together. One other reviewer mentioned that it will tip over with really heavy coats. My coats (even the winter ones) are apparently not that heavy. The real disappointment was that it took over a month to arrive. It took about two weeks after the last date predicted that I would receive it by. If you really want this coat rack, make sure you give it adequate time to arrive."
4,A little tipsy...but who can't lay claim to that once in a while.,"Hey, what do you want for 20 bucks!? Its a little tipsy, and could stand for a bigger base, but it works if you are not a moron and try to load everything on one side. Use zen when hanging your stuff.....balance...balance."
4,God product,"I bought this to use as a rack for handbags and hats rather than coats. Its nice looking, unobtrusive and minimalist. Very easy to put together, just attaching the feet, arms, and the cnter pole is two pieces that fit together. One drawback is that its hard to move from place to place because the center pole doesn't stay attached very well in the middle when the rack is lifted. But all in all very good product for the price, definitely recommend."
3,<><<> Solid but wobbly<><><><><,"I've put together the coat/hat rack and it looks sharp but even though I've tightened the screw underneath it, it's still wobbly when a coat is hung on it. (don't want to take a chance of stripping the screw by over tightening it). Oh well, it looks good and serves it's purpose."
1,As good as garbage,"The expression ""You get what you pay for"" comes to mind when I think of this product. This thing is cheap and ill-made; it lives up to its low price. After falling over for the hundredth time, I finally gave up and got rid of it. What a waste of money!"
2,You get what you pay for,When I first got this there was a part missing. I called the company and they quickly mailed me the missing part. This coat rack is very simple to assemble. The only thing that sucks is that it's flimsy. Next time I'll just spend more money and get a wooden one.
4,Coater Coat Racks,"Arrived on time. Easy to assemble. Just a bit woobly (but probably could tighten more myself), but worth what I paid for it. Exactly how it looks."
3,cheap and does the job,"The rack arrived in two days and all the parts were there. Once you put it together, you need to drill in extra screws to make it more stable. It works just fine."
2,Parts Kit Missing,"Package arrived on time - minus the parts kit (screws, nuts, bolts); so - while this might be a great coat hanger, I can't tell because I am unable to put it together for another week or two."
4,Adequate for my needs,Not super sturdy but sturdy enough for 2 or 3 jackets/sweaters in my small office space. Be sure to tighten all bolts well and you'll be fine! For the price I'm quite satisfied.
3,Simple but effective,"Quite a simple structure but I'm sure thats how they keep the cost down. The main pole does not lock together as well as I would have hoped, ending with it a little crooked. The unassembled hooks at top were hung by the threads during painting without masking so I had to clean out a few pieces to get them threaded properly. With that being said now that its together I have no major issues with the rack. It does exactly what is should and looks decent."
5,Metal Coat Rack,I bought one for my dad for Christmas and he was thrilled how sturdy the coat rack was while not taking up alot of space. One of his friends saw the coat rack which I ordered for them and they are also pleased with it.
4,nice modern rack for the price,good quality rack for the cost. i have it loaded up and it holds it all nice.
2,cheap - you get what you pay for,"I didn't have any problems installing this product. It's really easy to figure out. However, I've had this coat rack for a few weeks now and it wobbles like no other. The vertical pieces are twisted in and don't lock very well. You touch it a bit and it gets loose. Even when it's not loose, it wobbles. This is the cheapest coat rack on Amazon with decent reviews, but it honestly doesn't work all that well. You definitely need to carefully balance everything else it will tip over."
3,Cheap product cheap quality,"It is not a high quality coat rack and the pieces all fit together poorly The directions are piss poor and the base was about an eighth of an inch uneven on one side. The main thing is, it cost me $20 and it holds my coats just fine. It handles the weight well enough, but with a full load tends to bow in the direction of the heavier items."
3,"For the price, ok product.",The product fits the picture displayed. The only challenge is that the bottom stand does not fit snugly into the long pole.
1,Poor quality,This item is cheap and flimsy. It's made of very cheap metal and arrived with lots of scratches on it. It's not even worth the $22 I paid for it. We returned it immediately.
3,just ok,"I bought this stand to use to display items at craft shows. It goes together and comes apart easily, but it is not very sturdy. No matter what I do I can't get the base not to wobble. If I was using this in my house on a daily basis I'd be returning it."
3,You Get.......,"I wanted a reasonably priced coat tree, it is a little wobbly, but is worth what I paid for it."
5,Everything was great,Product arrived quickly and was in the condition as promised. It was well packaged to maintain condition of product. Would work with company again.
4,Just as I expected.,"My coat rack came quickly and I was excited to put it to use. I purchased mine to display purses and totes that I sell at vendor shows.I think the rack looks nice and is able to hold a fair amount of weight. It was sturdy, not wobbly in the least. I also found it easy to put together.I had read the reviews on this before hand and felt that it was exactly as I expected. It's nice not to have surprises when ordering! Great product for the price!"
2,Very disappointed,"I put this together in under 5min which was a great plus, but the only problem is that it wobbles. Too bad because it's really nice."
1,I am really not satisfied with this coat rack.,I am really not satisfied with this coat rack. It is unbalanced and I can't hang more than 2 or 3 paces of everyday dresses or it will fail.
4,Great coat rack,I bought this coat rack to display silk scarves that I make. It works perfectly and looks really great. Easy to put together and very rugged
4,Does the job,"So it's a coat rack, not many features to discuss here. My apartment owner neglected to add towel bars or hooks in our bathroom so I was looking for an alternative solution that wouldn't muck up the paint on the doors (hanging hooks) or involve putting holes in the wall. Our shower rod is also really weak and cannot support the weight of anything but the curtain. We have had this coat rack for a few weeks and it serves its job as a bathrobe/towel rack.I will mention that while it's not a HUGE piece of furniture, it's not small or delicate or pretty. It has a larger footprint than a floor lamp. My assembly-savvy roommate put this together in a matter of minutes. I am happy with this purchase."
4,Serves it's purpose,"This coat rack is pretty much as expected. It's slightly wobbly, so I would suggest that you hang the coats evenly around it. Would have been better if the legs were weighted."
5,great for the price.,It is a great product for the price. worth buying. I like the product. Now i have some more space in my closet and coats are available by the entry door as you go out and hang them as you come in.
3,It's ok...,"Easy enough to put together doesn't look too bad, but not that sturdy. You get what you pay for I guess although for what you are getting, the price could have been lower..."
2,"Cheap, but Functional","There really is no design to this, and it is all made from tube steel with plastic covers for the ends. Wobbly and cheap and not really pretty. That being said, for the $25 or so it costs, it works just fine as a coat rack."
4,Cute...,"Over the years I've owned several traditional wooden coat racks. When the last one bit the dust I decided to try something different. This one is lightweight, easy to assemble and modern! It's designed with shorter hooks on the bottom so things hang close to the pole and longer hooks on top so anything hung on them will still allow access to the lower items. It may not last forever, but it's unique and a decent value."
3,did anyone else have a problem with this?,"The coat rack arrived early and was slightly bigger than I expected it to be. The box came with a 1-page instruction diagram which was pretty self-explanatory. Assembly was not difficult at all: There were parts for the base, and the center pole was made out of three rods stacked on top of each other. the hooks you just need to pop them in and put a screw in to hold them in place.Now comes the problem. Once I put the coat rack upright, I realized the center pole (which = 3 rods stacked on top of each other without the use of any screws) waver a lot, and I haven't even put anything on any of the hooks yet. I am kind of scared that it would just tip over and hit my walls. I'm a bit scared to hang things on the coat rack. Also, because of the way the center pole is assembled, I have to hold the top and bottom of the coat rack every time I want to move it around.Does anyone have a problem with this? What do you do to fix it? Do you just glue the rods together?"
1,poor quality control,"This hat rack was purchased for my father, 92 yrs. old. When he took at out of the box there were no screws to put it together.Very poor quality control.Coater Coat Racks 8 Hook Coat Rack in Black Finish"
1,promises promises,Eight hook coat hat rack. One of hooks defective. Sent back description to company in California as per instructions. Letter returned. Wrote poor review for Athomemart. Customer service rep called to ask to remove poor review and part will be replaced in two days. Am still waiting for part. Supposedly in the mail but given wrong ups tracking number. This has been going on since February. I feel that I am getting a runaround. S. Friedman
4,"Modern coat, hat rack","Easy to put together, but there are no directions, only pictures. I wondered if the longer hooks go on top, or bottom, or if they should alternate. Anyway, I will see what works, the hooks are easy to move if needed. Great product for the price."
2,it wobbles!,"i was pleased with the price, but unfortunately the quality is not all that great...it wobbles! tried to fix it, but not possible."
1,Extremely poor quality,"The rack arrived today Dec 14, 2012. We immediately assembled it according to the instructions.In the process of assembly we notice rusted parts from poor paint work and missing parts (leg cap-rubber). After assembly the rack is unstable and tips over when a coat is hung on it.Have concluded that will not return because of work involved in dissembling the rack and having to ship it back.I really recommend Amazon to look at this item carefully for full review, before continuing to sell it."
2,coat rack terrible,"This coat rack is horrible. I would never buy one again. It falls apart, falls over, made cheaply. I'm sorry I bought it for my daughter's dorm room."
2,flimsy and wobbly,Far from any kind of quality. I bought two of these and they are both uneven. I guess you get what you pay for.
3,don't know about this one,This product was very easy to put together and looks great. The problem is that when you place a coat on the hooks the skrews loosen and the coat falls off. The product would be great for a summer jacket but not good for a winter coat at all.
1,Junk,"This coat rack is a total piece of junk. Please donot I repeat donot waste your money on this piece of garbage. I put this thing together, and within a day it was falling apart, I'm a professional engineer so I am pretty handy with the tools, but this rack was definitely not made to hold coats, or anything with that held weight for that matter.I honestly wish i could give this a 0 rating."
1,FREE SHIPPING IS A MISNOMER,"Even though the Amazon website advertises this item at $29.90 with free shipping, Amazon will not honor that price. The best you can do is buy from an affiliated reseller who offers free shipping at $40.66.Caveat emptor! Phone calls to Amazon were of no avail - though Amazon listed the item this way, Amazon would not honor that price."
1,6 weeks!,"After 6 weeks of waiting, customer service said it was going to be another 3 weeks! Forget it! Cancelled order."
4,Dependable as usual..........,"When I want to buy something online I almost always go to the Amazon website. It's nice to know that there is a place that you can shop and people are honest and that you can count on their integrity. Of course the average skeptic would say, ""well, that's a given, and things should be that way."" But get real....the majority of people are not necessarily honest. Unfortunately the minority are honest....I remember when that role was reversed......Anyway, Amazon appears to be a company bent on trying to please the consumer. No one is perfect but they strive to work in that direction."
5,this is a grreat CD*****,i bought this cd yesterday and i think it is unbelievable! i love every song on it. if your in the mood to buy a great cd get this one and not a cd that everyone else has. its worth it. you will love it....I PROMISE!!
5,Sammy's the man!,I've had this album on record for several years and finally found it on CD. This is Sammy at his intimate best. Most only think of Sammy as a glitzy Rat Packer. If you like quiet ballads - the old standards - you should find this CD a real treat. Laurindo Almeida nicely complements with thoughtful interludes.I've heard these songs hundreds of times by many different singers and groups. But I think of many of these renditions as the standard others must live up to. Give it a shot.
5,got this on vinyl,he was born to sing these songs in this way. i loved this album when all around me was changing. and i love it still.
1,Broke within a week,Had it for less than a week and it had a crack in it already. Not even worth the few dollars it was. My daughter used it one time.
3,Deceptive Photo!,"Absolutely love the product. Never had these for my 4 year old, because she is very careful and tidy. But my 2 year old boy? VERY GLAD TO HAVE IT FOR HIM!! I was shocked the package only had ONE holder, but he can only drink on juice at a time, so it's all good. I just figured I'd let everyone else know...read the fine print! 5 star for product. 1 star for deceptive photo. Average: 3 star"
4,No more juice box squeezing disasters!!!,"Finally, I can give my younger son a juice box without having to worry about him squeezing it and getting juice everywhere! This product is good quality and allows my son to drink juice boxes or bags with minimal worry on my part. Some juice boxes don't fit very well because of their shape, so they may just sit loosely in the holder and kids can easily take them out. Most fit just fine though and as long as they aren't sliding around in the holder, my son doesn't try to take them out. This is nice and sturdy, is easily cleaned, and is easy for little hands to hold. I would definitely recommend to other parents who have juice box squeezing children at home!"
2,Picture of Product is Deceiving,"Like others, I expected to get three juice box holders. I was surprised to only get one in my order when there was no mention of quantity, only the picture to show what you were ordering. I kept the juice box holder, because honestly, it does work great. My two-year-old has had zero spills or accidental squeezes when using his holder. I would recommend the product, but be aware of the quantity issue."
1,You only get one.. not three,"I usually always read the review, this one time i didn't since I was in a hurry. Not doing so has come back to haunt me.. The picture of the item show 3 so you would think it is a three pack. NOPE you are paying for one. Once you include shipping, it is a expensive piece of plastic."
2,Good idea but...,"This holder is a great idea (and inexpensive if that's a selling point). The only issue I have with it is an obvious one - the boxes don't stay in the holder. If you have something like a Capri-Sun that can be shoved in then it works fine but regular juice boxes don't stay put. If the little kid drops it, which mine frequently does, the box slides out and spills. It's OK if you're keeping your little kid in one spot to drink, but if they are running around, I would recommend just snipping open the juice box and pouring the juice in a leak-proof cup."
3,Okay....but,"It is wider than the normal juice box is these days which defeats the purpose of my buying it. We buy the Mots-for-Tots juice boxes and occassionally get the minute maid. Both brands are too narrow (handle to handle width) for the box. The front to back width is perfect. If you have a young child who you are thinking of buying these for so that the box doesn't dump out, then don't. If you have an older child who knows not to tilt it upside down or otherwise, go ahead."
1,Useless,"I really wanted to like this product, because I needed it, but - to be blunt - it sucks. I had 3 different types of juice pouches and boxes and it didn't fit any of them correctly, plus, my daughter could squeeze them anyway, defeating the whole purpose (she was only 18 months at the time!). Also, she just turned it upside down and they would fall right out. I used a rubber bad to hold the boxes in, but that did nothing to address the squeezing issue. So into the donation box it went."
4,Does the job,"Nothing fancy or expensive, just does it's job, aids and doesn't get in the way. Happy dad of juice lovers."
3,Good for juice boxes,"This product worked well for tightly fitted juice boxes, but not for pouches. I bought two of these for my 2 year old twins and if I put in a juice pouch they would just take it out and still squeeze it out everywhere."
5,No more wet clothes!,"Love giving my kids juice boxes when we're out and about - don't love them squeezing the juice all over themselves and their car seat. This totally did the trick and saved the day. I have 4 of them and keep them everywhere, just in case. They make it way easier for little hands to enjoy their drink. I'm not sure what someone was complaining about with them chipping, etc. I've had mine for ages and throw them in the dishwasher and they don't have a mark. Don't throw it off a cliff and it should be fine! For $2 you can't beat it!"
2,READ DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY YOU WILL RECEIVE ONE JUICE BOX!,"Works ok for drinks. Would be nice if it had a little strap of some kind attached over the top to keep child from pulling the box out. Read the description as the picture is deceiving, you will receive ONLY ONE JUICE BOX. They can be bought for less at other stores."
1,Poor quality,I purchased 2 of these last week and even at $2.00 each I paid too much for them. The plastic chips very easily and the design is very plain. It certainly did not fit many different types of juices. The really small juices fit but rattle around in there. The Motts juices don't fit in there. And even juice pouches are a tight fit.
1,DOES NOT fit Juicy Juice juice boxes.,"This does not fit the tall or short Juicy Juice juice boxes. I'm very disappointed and feel I have wasted money on this. Its big and looks like it'll only fit a carpri sun or drink in pouch, not any of the juice boxes that the description claims it fits!"
2,okay product,"I thought this product would work better but my 22 month old just takes the juice box out of it defeating the whole purpose of it. Also, it is a bit on the large size so it works only with the really big juice boxes. I only buy the 4 ounce juice boxes and this container is too big for it."
2,Letdown... totally,"I have the first Stanton Sessions and that cd is one of my favorites for sure. What happened with this one? Way too much cheesy hip hop lyrics mixed over the beats. The beats aren't that good either. Not much variety, if you heard every other break mix cd out there, you heard this. I gave it a two for a couple tracks that are ok. They don't justify the purchase of this. Well, I guess theres nothing to do but suck it up, and toss it in the ""I listened to it once, but forgot about it"" pile."
2,snore,"what happened to the stantons? the cash man came knocking? i think they got a taste of American club culture in put that into their mix. perhaps that makes things fresh and interesting in Europe. i find this mix tired and predictable. there are some solid tracks on here, and if you are the type who is easily pleased and you just want a nice mix for a house party then fine. but if you are a breakbeat conniseur (?) then go elsewhere. hopefully the Plumps will keep things real. this was a total letdown."
4,Tasty,"This is a pretty high energy set, rockin some edgy breakbeats throughout. There are a few bad apples among the track selection, but as a whole the mix stays right in the groove. Some of the mixing is a little abrupt, but with the tracks on this album it works well. As for the overall feel of the set, the first half is more of an electronic feel, while the latter half provides a gritty urban sound. I would definitely recommend picking up this album, it sounds fresh and is a great way to start off the beginning of a long night"
1,The Fundamentals of Extremism,"Talk about your extremists! This book, a compilation of multiple authors, is left wing extremism to the ninth degree. You can not get more liberal ideology than this. Everyone from Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay to Dr. James Dobson (Focus On The Family) is referred to as ""a right wing radical"". The formers crime no doubt is his support for Israel. The latter is guilty, of all things, being pro-family. His family values message is actually compared to Taliban-like mind control of children. One gets the impression that there is not a Republican and/or Conservative alive that could avoid the right wing label from these authors. If you are a person with a moderate philosophy, this book will be a complete turn-off."
1,Very 'Michael Moore',"I found this book to be based more on emotion than fact. The facts that were used were blown way out of proportion and context. While it is always healthy to look at both sides of the coin - politics included - this book would never give a fair representation of the fundamentalist side, because it is so focused on presenting the conservative view from a Gestapo perspective."
4,Eye-opening,"Kimberly Blaker and her co-authors have presented a well-researched, informative, and eye-opening account of the not-so-obvious ways Christian fundamentalists are seeking to overhaul our society, its government, and the educational system. The authors address the serious impact that these radicals have on children's welfare, women's rights, and separation of church and state issues. Anyone interested in preserving our constitutional and religious freedoms, from athiests to conservative believers, will benefit from understanding the epidemic of extreme beliefs in our country. This book has made me realize that it is not safe to sit by passively. The fundamentalists count on that. Instead, we must pay closer attention to the Christian fundamentalist movement and use our voting rights, at local, state, and federal levels, to take action against this very active minority emerging in the United States."
5,The Definitive Encyclopedia of Fraud,"Former FBI agent and white-collar crime expert Joe Wells, founder of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, is one of the world's premier experts on internal fraud by employees, managers, and executives -- or what he calls ""occupational fraud."" Here, he provides an exhaustive but accessible and compellingly readable survey of occupational fraud and abuse typologies. Thus, this book, which is based on hundreds of case studies, is not only an excellent primary text but a fine reference for anyone with a professional interest in fraud detection and prevention.With this book alone, Wells has done more than anyone to systematize the study of fraud. A must-read for fraud examiners and anyone else who deals professionally with occupational fraud risks."
4,A good recommendation,A friend recommended I get this to help me calm down. It's been good. It turns meditation into something simple. It's been very helpful.
2,Just an audio book,"If you are looking for a tape that will slowly lead you through a meditation exercise, with pleasant music in the background and a guide taking you through the steps, this is NOT the tape to get. This is more of an audio book that explains different meditation techniques. If that's what you're looking for, it's not bad, I guess. However, I wanted something else and was disappointed in the purchase."
2,A bit hokey,"I have heard some good things about meditation and it's benefits and before plucking down $600.00 for a TM class I wanted an introduction to see if it were for me. This book was a numbere of breathing excercise and really not much more ... for me. I am still interested in learning about meditation and hope to some day be able to achieve the ""zen like"" benefits. Unfortunately, this book did not ""get me there."""
4,Great price - very good product,"not much to say, works great- blade comes out a little shorter than I personally like but sturdy and cheap."
4,decent utility knife,Easy to handle and feels comfortable in my hand. Blades are sharp. Can't ask for anything else for an sub 10 dollar utility knife.
2,Look of quality but ...,"I was very impressed when I opened the package but I had trouble keeping the spare blade door closed. On day two I was working on a ladder and accidentally dropped the knife to the floor. The spare blade door popped open and it's latch broke. Now I use the knife with a rubber band holding the spares door closed. Too bad, seems really well designed in all other aspects."
5,Fantastic value for a utility knife,Well built utility knife with all the features one could ask for. Well weighted and easy to hold. It comes with 5 extra blades and the construction makes it easy to switch out for a new blade when necessary.
5,Super Mission,This record of God's action through the house-church in China and any who desire to reach closed countries with the Truth of Jesus Christ.
3,"Good explanation of ""Back to Jerusalem"" movement","This book gives a good explanation of the ""Back to Jerusalem"" missionary movement that started with house churches in China. It is of supplemental and informative nature rather than a good story for reading."
3,Good for what it is,"Good knife but made cheap. Locking handle on mine came in broken. Received refund with no problem. For just a couple dollars more in price, a better made knife is available and recommended."
4,Hail to the March King!,What American does not know the name of John P. Sousa (Okay - maybe those over 30 years old at least) His music still fills one's chest with pride for our country and will outlast some of the modern music of today. There is something grand in his work and I am one that is happy to have purchased this CD.
2,Slow,"I bought this book awhile ago, and have not made too much progress reading it. I love to read, but find this one to be very slow."
2,Over My Head,"I have read several dozen books on the subject of Cosmology and related topics. This is a technically oriented book filled with intricate mathematical formulas and is clearly geared for advanced students. I am not shy about mathematics or formulas as a rule and have handled other books on Quantum mechanics, relativity and physics but this book was just over my head."
3,Good book,Parts of it were good. The plot thickened in the midlle but faded nearer the end. An OK read for passing time.
2,Hate the remix sound,"I think this version is not nearly as clean sonically as the original Philadelphia Classics CD. The bass here is jacked up too much, and vocals and instruments seem a bit veiled. The original CD had plenty enough bass and the arrangements had an immediacy and clarity that sound superb to this day. I love all the music on this compilation; I just think the original issue was better sonically. (And BTW, I used to be a disco DJ in a former life.)"
1,Overclaims - Underdelivers,"The publishers promise more than the book delivers. In Project 1 (20% of the book) non-code design issues are dealt with in a summary fashion. CSS code is built directly, without reference to the DW Manage Styles interface. Passing reference is made to DW's Templates. Much is left to your own skill set. The downloadable files degrade poorly in IE6. If you need to expand your DW skills:- Avoid. If you just want to code CSS:- consider."
4,Perfect for kids,"We bought these forks for our preschool-age children to use, and they've worked perfectly. They're just the right size for 2-4 year olds, sharp enough they can successfully spear their food, but not too sharp."
1,Vidal Sassoon 21-piece hair trimmer,"I DO NOT recommend this item. I used it once and it kept catching in my son's hair, was not cutting and had to be cleaned constantly. I have used Conair hair trimmers before and I puchased another after using this one once. Now, I'm not sure what I should do with it."
1,Information is wrong.,The image and description are for a 2006 Japanese film (Sekiry no onna) with the international title of THe Legend of the Red Dragon. This is not the Jet Li film from 1994 as indicated by the printed title and cast/director.
5,GET OVER IT............blue skies on mars,"For starters it is high time for people to enjoy Matthew for all his other great works and stop limiting him to just ""Girlfriend."" Music is ever changing as one can tell from this album. These are some of his best works through the 1990's to 2000. For a true musician it is important to expand and experiement with new sounds, to not is to sound like all the tiny bopper bands we are indendated with today.If you want to hear the wholeness of Matthew get this album. It is truly the best of the best. Matthew is a GOD and people should know."
4,If You Buy Only One Matthew Sweet CD . . .,". . . it should be Girlfriend, which is exceptionally strong from beginning to end. But, if you buy a second Matthew Sweet CD, this would be a good one. It collects most of the high points of his other records, including Someone To Pull The Trigger, his finest moment after Girlfriend. The second half of this CD represents a slight fall off in quality, if only because the songs are less startlingly fresh and inspired than the others. Compared to nearly everyone else's work, on the other hand, they are very fine indeed. I only wish there were better liner notes. Buy this if you like catchy, intelligent pop music, and aren't afraid of a screaming (but melodic) guitar or two. PLAY IT LOUD!"
4,"Some of Matt's Best, to date... where is he going next?","Matthew Sweet has given us the best Real Rock music of the decade, starting with ""Girlfriend"". Meaningful Lyrics, jangly guitars, melodies, harmonies. Herein is a representative sample of his Power Pop, MISSING some of his best, as described by others below. I guess the label is leaving room for the Best of, Vol. 2, with ""Superbaby"", ""Does She Talk"", ""Come to California"" and the other classics conspicuous in their absence from this ""Best of"".But, what a great introduction!Matthew Sweet's music is music you can hum, it sticks in your head when you hear it. It is fresh after being played over and over. It just like, well, it's very much a best Rock from the 60's or 70's! Except it comes from the musically impoverished 90's.Anyway, BUY THIS and LISTEN. When you like it, and you will, go buy ""Girlfriend"". You'll want more."
4,Lost Pop Gems,"Why Matthew Sweet hasn't consistantly had hit records remains one of the mysteries in modern music. It looked like he was headed for stardom after ""Girlfriend"", but it never happened. This best of collection follows his excellent ""Pet Sounds for the 90's"" ""In Reverse"". And although fans will quibble at track selection this is a solid set. Those who are fans of Big Star, the Raspberries, Badfinger, Beatles, Beach Boys will love this cd. Not a bad song in the bunch. The two new songs fit in quite well. Listen to this over and over. Then go out and buy his other cds."
2,greatest hits albums are useless,"I like Matthew Sweet. He has never put together a complete album but is a good songwriter. Why a greatest hits cd? Greatest Hits cds are usually reserved for washed up artists and a chance for a record company to cash in. Who buys these things? Greatest hits CDs always fail to include less popular great songs. They are impossible to make. Buy the individual albums instead. Matthew, greatest hits cds are for the likes of REO Speedwagon, Styx, Eddie Money etc..not you.. you get the picture"
3,Some Pleasing Material On This CD,"I first heard Matthew Sweet in the early nineties when 'Sick Of Myself' was getting some airplay over here in Australia. I liked the song so I went out and bought '100% Fun' on cassette. I enjoyed some of the songs, didn't like some others. So instead of buying it on CD I bought this 'Best Of' instead. My opinion of this album is the same as for '100% Fun'. Although most of the tracks are different from '100% Fun' there are only some songs I like enough to keep listening to. The rest aren't really that good. The tracks I truly enjoy are Sick Of Myself, We're The Same, If Time Permits and So Far. I guess it's not too bad to use as background music while you're doing something else (like writing album reviews!). The more attention you pay to the music the worse the songs sound, besides the few good ones. Matthew Sweet is certainly capable of writing good songs, just not enough of them."
4,Great Book,"This book really captivated me because it was so real. The main character Marietta, was a phenomonal character because the book talked about her struggles. Straight used many different techiques to point out her trials and tribulations throughout this book. it talks about her going through womanhood, pregnacy and life. Marietta was a caring yet comforting person to be around. I would recommend this book for all people to read becase takes you through a lot of emotions. Crying, shouting and thinking all at the same time. So go and buy this book , read it and really try to learn something from it."
5,This novel is the best kept secret! Excellent!,"This book hooks you right from the beginning and never lets you go. I laughed out loud and I also cried. The writing syle of Susan Straight is extrodinary, She throws you full force into the 1950's and brings you full circle in the 1980's. The main character Marietta could easily be anyones mother or grandmother. Her sorrrows and triumphs will make the human spirit soar. I look forward to reading her next novel. This book is definitely a 5 star. You will not want to put it down!"
4,Awesome - Grand Canyon Pictures,"I recently purchased this book for my boss who when white water rafting in the Grand Canyon. He loved the book, he related to alot of the pictures and was happy to relive the moment again."
3,ok,"Not enough 0-rings for 8 injectors,It takes 2 -rings per injector when replacing them all still had to buy more locally"
3,Installed fine,"Works, what can I say? Arrived in a timely fashion. I would recommend this item to anyone rebuilding an engine."
1,"A ""Golden Book"" about Forensic Medicine","This is a book for juveniles. The author claims that it is a textbook but it would not be used by anyone higher than in the fourth grade. Some parts of it read as if they had been lifted wholesale from the 1st chapter of the 4th edition of Spitz & Fisher's ""Medicolegal Investigation of Death"", the bible of forensic pathology. Even dilettantes should steer clear of this book. It is a complete waste of time and money."
5,Great Item For The Money,"Absolute bargain, a really handy tray to have when you're working on cars, and it's well-built and sturdy."
5,soft cases,"I bought these for extra cases. After buying sheets, I love these, after washing they are so soft. I'll never go back to the cheap sheets. I'll pay a little more for something nice. :)"
5,The best present!,I bought this heart pendant for my frien'ds birthday and she loved it. She said that frommall presents which she has received for her birthday she finds my pendant for the best and most beautiful gift. I am happy that i chose the right prsent and that she likes it. It's a great gift for every woman!
3,Chain is weak link,I bought this for my wife and she loves it. The only flaw that kept the pendant from getting more stars is the chain. It is much too delicate. We had to purchase a separate chain for the heart.Other than that we are very pleased
4,Kinda small,This is a very nice necklace but the chain is very thin and the pendant is kinda small. My girlfriend loves it and wears it everyday.
2,Looks cheap,Looked like something you would buy at the dollar store. Boxing was extremely cheap looking and the clasp was not as shown in pic of product. Would not recommend this purchase.
3,Tiny,"Well this thing is small. Considering the price you can't really complain, but the lady can. It is cute, but oddly small and fragile. I would not recommend this for anyone who is active or hard on jewelry."
3,Priced too high for the quality,"Chain is light, cheap. Hook gets caught in the pendant. If the pendant falls off, it's not easy to get back on. For this price it should have none of these problems. Overall, the necklace is pretty when it's on."
2,way too small,"When i bought this i thought it would have been much bigger, but to be honest my girl really like it so i guess thats all that matters"
4,Fantastic necklace!,"The necklace was a gift for my gf on our anniversary. She loves it! We have been looking for a heart shaped necklace with diamonds on the side for quite a while, none of them were up to our liking. Then finally we found this lovely piece of jewellery in amazon! We had to pay import and shipping fee of $55 to deliver it to the UK, the original product cost only $73. It was totally worth it! The heart is not too big but looks very delicate."
2,"Small, dingy necklace","I bought this necklace because my girlfriend likes smaller, not-guaudy jewelery. I thought that this may fit the bill. In the photos, it shines, and the scale is slightly ambiguous.When it arrived, it was dingy and smaller than I expected. On top of that, the diamonds are low quality (I knew that they would not be great with an I color rating and I2 clarity, but COME-ON MAN!).I am going to try to shine this up with some kind of cleaner, and hope it shines up a bit."
4,Looks very nice.,"I got this for my girlfriend just as a ""hey thinking of you"" type deal. She loved it. Shes not a jewelry person and the chain and pendant are fairly light. It is however a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but my girlfriend doesn't seem to care."
4,makes a nice gift,Purchase one for my wife as a little birthday present. She absolutely loved it. The price was terrific and the quality was exceptional.
1,DON'T BUY THIS - IT'S JUNK!!!,"This item is very deceiving. It measures about a quarter of an inch and the diamonds need to be viewed with a magnifying glass!! The chain is absolute junk. The item came boxed as most necklaces do, but the chain was hopelessly knotted in three places. I ended up breaking it, which was very easy to do with my bare hands, and spending another $60 to buy a decent chain. DO NOT BUY THIS NECKLACE. You will be very disappointed."
4,Great Pendant,This is a great pendant. But before you give it to your loved one or begin wearing it get a new chain for it. My wife's chain broke after about a month or two of wearing it.
4,Cute and delicate,"Received this as a Christmas gift from my husband. I had it on my wish list because we are expecting our first baby and thought the 3 stones were a nice symbol of our little family. The heart is smaller than I expected, although that is fine with me. I prefer more delicate jewelry. However, the chain is very thin and I had to switch it out with one I already had. I couldn't work the clasp myself it is so small. Overall very happy with it so far."
4,She Approved,"I got this for my girlfriend, and she liked it very much. The chain was kinda weak/small, so she replaced it with a bigger on she had to not risk any problems. Otherwise, good necklace and great gift."
4,Very cute. Smaller than anticipated,The piece is very cute and looks just as pictures. Quality is excellent for the price. The pendant is a bit smaller overall than anticipated but overall happy with the purchase.
3,"Lovely, but oops!","This is my wife's Valentine's Day present. It's lovely. But alas, the chain was tangled upon arrival. We tried to pick it apart with pins, but we broke the chain in the process.I know these chains are easily tangled. But it should have been packed more carefully."
1,Absolute Junk,"Looks great in the pictures but not when you get it. Aside from the flimsy cheap chain that everyone is complaining about, the pendant is complete crap. It looks like it was stamped out of sheet metal and the back is completely hollow and greyish black. Looks like crap when it gets turned over. My girlfriend pretended to like it, threw out the box and hasn't worn it since Christmas. 55 days and counting..."
4,Fantastic Little Pendant,"As many other reviews are saying, it is very small, but that just makes it dainty. The box it comes in was a bit cheesy, but if you are worried about that, it would not be hard to pick up a different one. It`s a steal of a deal for the quality of the necklace and it arrive 3 days after I ordered it!! I`m impressed!"
4,she loves it,If this is for a small woman like mine is then she will love it. Will post update on how chain is holding up. .
3,Chain Too Small,Trying to take the necklace out of the package the necklace has a knot in it that I cannot get out. Maybe I will take it to a jeweler and see if they can help me.I wish the chain was a little thicker.
4,"Small, but pretty","The pendant on the necklace is small, but when it's on someone, it looks pretty and the size rather looks like it fits.And like everyone pointed out, the chain feels like it might break, but it has resistance to stay intact if taken care of properly.Also, when ordering a new chain, you will have to consider how big the opening is on the pendant for the chain to go through. I ordered a chain that wasn't that thick, but the endpoints ended up being too thick to go through the pendant."
3,3-stone pendant,The pendant is beautiful but the chain was very thin and flimsy. I had to replace the chain immediately.
4,Mr. Charming,"This was Salam at his most ""sweet and charming"". The story was cute, but did get a little wild and out there for a minute! This was a movie for the family. Salam works really well with kids. He should write a movie where he is in charge of kids in some way. Heidi Klum would be a great co-star. Her show with kids is really funny!"
1,SUB COLTRANE SCREECHINGS!,Memo to aspiring John Coltrane clones-you don't have to play a few notes and then screech in the high register every few minutes. Trane knew how to pace himself and make his solo's interesting. This is just plain irritating. Every solo ends up the same. Every song is the same. After a while it grinds you down just as 'live in Newport' did for those brought up on 'village vanguard' by Trane (the first one with 'chasing' on it) If you like your sax playing frenzied be my guest but for me this is just a parody and a bad one at that. He isn't even that good to be honest. Try the Branford Marsalis 'love supreme' dvd to see Coltrane done properly. More light and shade please!
3,dosent last long,bought this not expecting much but for the price it lasted about a year and a half.good cheap radio. tuner dosent pick up stations that well.
4,good product,Very good battery last much longer than my old battery.The charger works very good to charges fast enough for me
1,Never received it!,"I am not essentially eligible to review this item, cuz I never received the item in mail!Thanks."
2,"Rec'd, battery OK, charger not.","Got the battery and charger set in a reasonable time. Battery works fine I guess, but haven't got the charger to work yet. Haven't had the time to complain."
2,Sizes are Listed Wrong,"The sizes listed for these are incorrect. The product information says they are 1.5"" across the flange. They are only 1.125"". They are the same standard small size that most of them are. Unfortunately, I needed the large size and these are not it!"
5,The Wolves at the Door: The True Story of America's Greatest Female Spy,"This is a truely fasinating book! It is very well written. Even though it is written about a particular person it also includes snatches of history to set the stage for the story. It helps you to feel what the people were going through at that time, especially the main character of the book, but it is written with a balanced view--no agenda. It is not a light read but is so interesting that it keeps your attention the whole way through. After reading this book, I will definitely be watching for other books written by this author."
5,Loved this book.,"This book was exciting and fascinating with an inside look at the world of covert ops in WWII and the brave men and women who took part in the French resistance. Virginia Hall was truely amazing. My husband and I both loved this book. We couldn't put it down, and it is a fast read."
4,Truly Interesting,"This is a very interesting and readable book. Though I remember World War II vividly and have read about it ever since it ended, I had never heard of this remarkable lady. She makes a better model for younger women today than the current stars of movie and music fame. This is not the greatest literary work available, and it is certainly a one-sided view of the war, but it was informative and rather well documented. I plan to give it to my teenage granddaughter. She can use it as a book report and will enjoy the true story of an able, fascinating American woman."
4,"Good word lists, but outdated.","This is a useful book containing list of words relating to subjects, not synonyms as in a typical thesaurus. For instance, you might find a list of various kinds of boat, rather than a list of words that mean boat. It has purposes that make it better than a thesaurus for some situations. It needs to be more exhaustive, and it would be nice to have a version that had been updated since 1936."
5,MFSB's debut album.,"This was MFSB's debut album and it includes their cover versions of Curtis Mayfield's ""Freddie's Dead"", Sly & The Family Stone's ""Family Affair"" and The O'Jays' ""Back Stabbers"". MFSB's record sales and acrooss-the-board popularity may never have matched those of their labelmates The O'Jays, Billy Paul, Lou Rawls, Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes and Teddy Pendergrass but many of MFSB's albums were pivotal releases that helped shape the sound of such genres as Disco, Quiet Storm and Smooth Jazz. Enjoy!"
5,Love it,"This book is great. Ian covers a lot of ground about exercise and gives you a great training routine which will add muscle and shed fat with NO CARDIO! I gained weight while I lost fat around my waist! This is by far one of my best and favorite workout plans and books. A great book for anyone interested in getting in looking better and getting stronger! My deadlift went from 250lbs to 345lbs, my squat went from 205lbs to 250lbs! I was very happy with the results from this book!"
5,Billy is Awesome!,"This CD is so awesome! Billy has a great voice and really knows how to work it! He goes from the pop/rock of ""Urgently in Love"" to the saucy latin groove of ""Mary Lopez"". If you're debating whether or not to buy this CD, go for it! It's worth the money!"
5,I love BILLY CRAWFORD,"I mean, he's the babe in looks and in music!! Everyone has 2 get this cd!!!! I love every sond on the track!!!! His song ""Fly"", I love, but it's not on his cd, but that's not 2 worry. Cuz he's got 13 and more other great songs!! I have even met him!! He's the bomb!! If u wanna talk about Billy email me!!!!!"
4,Crisp Comedy from Noel Coward,"My pleasure was somewhat marred by the difficulty of hearing all of the dialog; however, that detracted but little from the joy of hearing once more the wit of Noel Coward (who produced this film version of his stage-play) and the inimitable comedic talents of Margaret Rutherford and Rex Harrison. The featured stars playing Harrison's two wives also perform admirably. Those of us who saw the film when it first came out and occasionally thereafter, may find it not quite as fresh-sounding as when first issued, particularly in light of the frequent television and film versions of ghost-returning comedies, but the freshness of the Coward variation still retains its ability to entertain.I should recommend it to almost all ages which have achieved the ability to understand speech."
4,Blithe Spirit,"What a classic - awesome. The VHS was all good and played well. No problems. I was studying this play for an audition, so wanted to see the original again ... it met all expectation .. sadly I didn't get to audition for the part of Mrs Ruth Condimine, it was pre-cast!"
4,Pure Spirit & Nostalgia,"After reading previous reviews I was expecting to be disappointed - but NOT A BIT. It was a joy to see a young Margaret Rutherford cavorting around as Madame Arcati, and a surprise to find the movie in colour. Whilst the colours were maybe a tad faded, it added to the authenticity of such an old movie. Thoroughly enjoyable."
4,A great movie to watch on arainy day,For fans of the amazing late Margaret Rutherford this film is a real treat of her natural comic talents. Without her Rex Harrison's character would not appeal. Rutherford's role of an eccentric psychic lends a touch of greatness to this movie as well as provide ample laughter.
4,One wife too many,"The story if not the film has held up well over the years. Rex Harrison and Kay Hammond have a fun time rekindling their old love. The only probably is that Charles' dear wife, Elvyra, is dead, and he has to try to convince his new wife, Ruth, that this is a spirit, with a delightfully malevolent quality as it turns out, haunting his life. Unfortunately, the film quality has deteriorated and the technicolor no longer seems so bright. Elvyra is a miserable green, one assumes from envy, to see her husband has a new love in his life, for in her mind nothing could replace the love she felt for him. The story has been told countless times, but the repartee between Rex Harrison and Kay Hammond is hard to match, not to mention Margaret Rutherford taking a wonderful turn as Madame Arcati."
1,wrong region for america .......region 2 ...why sell it here ?,"I live in America and the dvds we view here are region 1 , the movie they sent me was for region 2 , I can't watch it and have no use for it , I can't even donate it to the library as they too would have no use for it , I wanted to return it but was sent no return envelope or even an address to send it back to , WHY SELL A DVD THAT CAN'T BE VIEWED IN AMERICAN DVD PLAYERS ? I have bought from this company before and never had an issue but now I will never buy from them again as they do not have a care for their customers in the least .VERY DISAPPOINTED ,"
1,wonderful film - terrible transfer to DVD,"Blithe Spirit is a bright, sophisticated comedy. The film is brilliantly acted and the humor still holds up today. Unfortunately, whatever the source is of this DVD transfer, the soundtrack sounds as if it is playing at munchkin-like speed and lip-sync is seldom achieved. See it on PBS where a better copy is shown. If you buy this disc it will wind up gathering dust after the first viewing - it isn't watchable."
1,"Arrived Aug 31, 2012 Only Good Until Dec 2012","Arrived Aug 31, 2012 Only Good Until Dec 2012.They are selling old medicine - it should be good for at least a year."
4,Useful for adults who cannot swallow pills,"I take a dose which approaches that of adult tylenol, which means 3 of these tablets. They do not require water and can be carries in a pocket to use anywhere. I think tylenol misses the boat by not supplying a formula like this for adults."
2,Tylenol Package,Package arrived crushed in the soft envelope it was shipped in. Half of the pills were not usable. I bought on line for convenience put throwing away half of it will make me think again.
3,Unmet expectations,"I own the companion book to this one. The author does an excellent job explaining in great detail about the tabernacle. I purchased this volume expecting the same quality of work. The quality of the work is there, but the quantity is lacking in the book I was sent. The book is a scanned copy of an original. It was scanned landscape but was printed portrait. In other words, half of the right hand page is missing. The entire left hand page is complete. You have to try and figure out what is missing. This is tragic this great work is lost due to a printing error. I called the vendor and they took the details, but never returned my call. I kept the book and have been studying what I have, but it is disappointing not to have more of the book to use."
5,Wonderful Album By LONGVIEW-High Lonesome,This is a wonderful traditional Blussgrass band. I love every song on the ablum. I highly recommend it!! FIVE STARS.Any fan of traditonal bluegrass will love this whole album.
5,"IMMACULATE FOOLS: ""A Smart Band For Smart People!""","Definitely, 80's have been an extraordinary muisc era. A great sample of it are Immaculate Fools (stars by themselves), it's hard to believe how luckless they are about selling their records, and also their fans in order to get them (included me!) I've been looking for their records for several years!. I agree with the idea they are one of the finest bands of rock-pop, thanks to a great Mexican radio station called ""Rock 101"" (unfortunately dissapeared 7 years ago) many people had the chance to meet them, and a lot of became their fans. I hope we can get all of their records, because they are Art Pieces more than a simple item. It would be nice to get in any format their first record ""Nothing Means Nothing"" (including their hit ""hearts of fortune"") and also some rarities or live presentations. I'M SURE THEY'RE A GREAT BAND!!!...Finally I'll get their treasures..."
4,Informative and readable,I used this book to write a discussion of Organisational management - I felt the authors were very clear in their objectives and that it was a great book for understanding exactly what went on - an interesting and detailed account.
2,"Cute, but I don't believe in this witchcraft stuff",The ideas are cute but I didn't realize this was a book for witches. I'm merely a nature lover. Okay I did think that the ideas were good but the authors need to learn to spell magic and magical. Since when do these words have k's in them???
5,One of the very best,"This magnificent situation comedy deserved the best in reproduction. IT HAS IT, in this magnificent DVD collection of the entire series.The editing - in particular the very efficient manouvering to achieve the exact episode/portion one wishes to view and the chance to easiliy correct a wrong choice/selection, is truly masterful.There can never be a more efficient and trouble free rendition of the truly wonderful original show, than this complete set of Third Rock provides. Very few reproductions, of original productions, reach the astoundingly high standards of this reproduction of Third Rock. Well done!"
5,3rd rock from the sun complete series,3rd Rock from the Sun is probably more funny today then when I first watch it in the 90's. What could be funnier than Aliens trying to pretend to be human. I love the adventures that they get into it is everyday stuff we don't think about and the writers made it so funny. I love where they thought Jello was alive and so the of course kill it and but it down the sink. Everyone should watch this series we laugh so hard we have to rewind and watch it again.
4,Where's the beef?,"A very theoretical read. Don't expect to be able to fully grasp the contents of this book without having some other one's handy. Not for beginners, lot's of references to the classics. Very useful if you're beginning to construct a lit review for an important paper, even a dissertation."
2,"Decent, but not great",Cheap paint job and awkward mounting brackets at are loosely glued in.Looks nice once you take the time to fasten the brackets and mount the stand with proper hardware.
3,No directions!!!,"The over all quality of this product is a four star for the price, but it doesn't come with building instructions so Good luck putting it together cause it took me 3 days by myself!!!"
3,"Whisker World Deluxe Cat Amusement Center Cat Furniture, Beige","The Kitty amusement center is great. It housed a special place for the mature cat to hide from the newly acquired kitten, while said kitten plays. The structure is smaller than anticipated and was assembled by teenagers easily. In a home with limited space, it's a plus to have for an indoor kitten."
1,Waste of Money,"Thought that the product would be great for my 4 cats but it was just a waste of money!! Out of my 4 cats only one will use it is my 10lb Calico cat and she will only sit on the top platform (which is very small). Heads up for anyone who buys this item, they don't send you enough long dual thread bolts so you can't use the toys that are shown."
3,Not the best.,"This is not too sturdy, and the plastic things keep falling off. The instructions should be clearer. The large posts are different sizes, are coded the same letter, but there is no indication of which to use where (side A versus side B)."
1,Very Little Value,"This DVD ranks as the number one worst DVD's I have ever seen. Not only was it a poorly made home video, it had very little informative travel or cultural information. It completely lacked substance. What you get is some guy walking around filming the day as it progresses while he courts his internet bride. There were MANY awkward moments where anyone that is a seasoned traveler felt sorry for the participants. You basically have to sit through someone elses boring home made video with no substance just to see his trip from his perspective. Suggestion: Save your money and buy a Travel Guide and just go there."
1,Save your money,This is just one big home movie. No real useful info. Choose a travel guide and avoid this item.
3,Cute,"My kids love Steve Songs. He appears on our local PBS station playing short little songs in between shows. The DVD starts out good with cute little skits but then goes into ""concert"" footage which is also good but then the kids started losing interest. I have not yet had the chance to watch it all the way until the end to see if it switches back to the cute skits. Overall it's cute."
3,nice dvd but wished there was more,my daughter loves teh steve songs from tv.so we wished they included the songs from tv. we never heard any of teh songs from the dvd- its a nice dvd with songs- but wanted the tv songs on there
5,THE BEST MUSICAL DVD FOR KIDS EVER!!!!!!!,"I am the mother to an energetic 21 month old little boy who absolutely loves ""SteveSongs!"" Before I became a mother I was a kindergarten teacher and I have seen A LOT of musical DVDs for young children...this is the best DVD by far! My husband and I find ourselves singing the songs when our son isn't even around...it is that good! There is also a concert portion that is interactive and teaches cute movements that go along with the songs. Along with this purchase we also bought ""Baby Boost"" and ""The Laurie Berkner Band."" They don't even compare to ""SteveSongs!"" Take it from me...""SteveSongs"" is the best there is! The only downfall is that he has yet to make another DVD...your kids will become hooked and they will want more! I can only hope that there will be more ""SteveSongs"" coming our way soon!"
4,Steve songs; Marvelous Day DVD/CD.,Great dvd; kept my son engaged. I was hoping for some songs other than those that he plays on PBS.
2,Disappointed,"My kids were excited when I received this in the mail after purchasing it on this site. After the first 6 or 7 short songs, the remaining of the video was this live, dragged out boring performance for which my kids (ages 2 & 4) quickly lost interest. It would've been nice if they left out the live stuff for regular videos."
5,Awesome!! Great for all ages - young and old!!,"All three of my children love Steve Songs and love Steve's new video. It is very difficult for me to find something that all three can enjoy, since there is such an age difference (10,8,3) My oldest enjoys the band with the instruments, my middle one the singing, and my youngest loves ""Silly Vanilly"". Steve is awesome! The only thing better than the DVD is seeing one of his live band shows!!"
5,simply overwhelming,"Dalai Lama gives a very structured and easy to follow introduction of buddhist beliefs.Moreover, he provides meditation techniques that can be applied in daily life, during each encounter with other beings"
2,Stayed sticky,The surface of the repair was sticky for days after applying. I since found out that you have to get it into the sun within 30 seconds of applying it. Putting clear plastic over repair also helps. They should have detailed this in the instructions. I might try product again now that I know these tips.
1,Waste of Reading Time,".... This book was a monumental waste of my reading time. The characters were thinly drawn, the plot far-fetched and a bit ludricrous, and the ending disappointingly absurd. The author did indeed illustrate he enjoyed playing with words, but I didn't enjoy the game he liked to play. ..."
5,Do Not Leave This Stone Unturned,"In this suspenseful novel, the antisocial lives of homeless people, criminal elements, and even a prominent but pathologically warped surgeon are interwined. The author uses a vivid imagination and descriptive language and dialogue to weave an unusual plot in a unique manner which depicts its dysfunctional and highly-flawed characters in a critical yet human light. The story is told in the first person by Colin (Birdy) Franklin, who leaves his upper class home as a teenager to live for many years in the forbidding underworld of Boston in order to escape a horrible reality involving his father which is not revealed until well into the book. The inner thoughts of this tortured yet intelligent soul trying to come to terms with his disenfranchised existence and his father's past, while at the same time surviving each new day, are what truly makes this absorbing tale intrinsically worthwhile as well as highly entertaining reading."
1,Not deserving of 4 1/2 stars,"I often depend upon the reviews in Amazon for helping me to find reading that is a bit off track and different, but still entertaining. I picked this book for my book club and hated it! Now I've subjected 8 of my friends to its awful plot as well. The graffic depictions of the meat factory were disgusting! The main charater was unbelievable and the enemy unlikely. I wonder who the people who gave the book 5 stars were, the authors Mother?"
1,The wrong choice for teaching yourself,"Despite being a 'Teach Yourself' book, I have found it quite frustrating to use on my own. Little attempt is made to repeat vocabulary, so I find myself needing to look up almost every word in every sentence. The appendix with grammatical forms is very thin, lacking such basic entries as personal pronouns, definite articles, and adjectives. This leads to constant thumbing back through chapters to find where something was first introduced. But perhaps the worst flaw is that the reading consists mainly of single, isolated sentences. I often find that I can't understand a sentence even when I've gotten all of the vocabulary and grammar correct, because there's no context for the meaning."
3,Quite difficult,"A major difficulty for a student of ancient languages is the amount of grammar he has to learn. I have some knowledge of Sanskrit and so I overestimated my ability to master the grammar of Greek. Though this is not a bad book, it is too full of grammar and thus makes for difficult reading. I couldn't get a feel for the language as I really felt lost in the grammar. I have already forgotten all the grammar! A better approach for the author would have been to introduce simpler passages from the Greek authors and then introduce the grammar related to the text. Perhaps I should have bought the ""Teach Yourself Ancient Greek (Foundation Course)"" first :-("
3,Good Information,"This book gave clear example of what was wrong with boards however, lack clear direction on solutions. Felt I was reading to encourage hiring a consultant."
5,The Best!!,"I dont know whats in this face wash... but It cleans my skin better than all the face wash i ever used! I used all kinds of face wash, but this Shiseido is the BEST!!!"
2,Good for Divorces not Deaths,"This book starts out encompassing and addressing the different losses we can suffer breaking up, divorce and death of a spouse. The grieving portion of this book although small is quite good in addressing the process of grieving and healing.For me I was looking for a book that addressed the issue of starting over again after the loss of a spouse. This book DOES NOT address this issue. The starting over portion of the book,which is 75%, is directed at break ups or divorces. It talks about taking and accepting blame for the break up or divorce. There is no mention at all about starting over after the death of a spouse.If you are coming out of a divorce or a break up this would be a good book. If your wife or husband died I would not recommend this book. There are better books on the market that address this type of loss."
3,Life must go on,"I read this book several months after the breakup of my last engagement. I am an older lady who was divorced after our son left home in 1989. I suppose the points John makes aren't new, but it seems somewhat comforting to hear them echoewed by someone who deals with emotional challenges on a daily basis. I'm not seeking to be comprehensive in this book reivew, I'm sure there will be yet more reviewers. But the points he makes with respect to healing, and not comparing your new relationship with the old are valid. The point he makes about the grocery list seems true, and I've decided he's right, and I'm wrong. The points he makes about healing memories is true on several fronts, and I believe he is right on that one point if none else. Take what you can use, and throw away the rest."
1,"This book is not only stupid and sexist, but dangerous","I too would love to give this book a negative star. During my worst times, my work is what has helped pull me through and my on-going friendships, certainly not going out and scoping out a new warm-body. He recommends that men have sex with as many women as possible, without commitment, while women should date as many men as possible without sex. Has this guy ever heard of AIDS? Honestly, how many women are going to have sex with a guy whose main goal is to use them to help ""recover"". The reason why the man is divorced probably has everything to do with his inability to deal with emotional issues,............................ Furthermore, it places the responsibility for sex in the woman's lap, like always, and promotes objectification. What a bunch of garbage. What is the name of his next book going to be after he gets divorced again? Mars and Venus Starting Over, and Over, and Over."
3,Starting over requires more than a healed heart,"John Gray, Ph.D. has an amazing understanding of hearts that have been broken by divorce or the death of a spouse. He has probably helped thousands of people through what can be a very long grieving process. Where this book falls short is advice on how to find a new love interest. Meeting your next sweetie can be very difficult, and this book gives very scant advice about where you would most likely meet that person. People who want a new spouse, significant other, lover, or friend for movies and vacations need more help than this book offers.Finding Your Sweetie After 50"
1,More sexist blather,"Another condescending book from John Gray, who seems sometimes to be stuck in the 1950's. With most women working outside of the home these days, he fails to address how a woman's intellectual interests may help her to heal. I understand his point about being careful not to deny your own needs by focusing too much on the needs of others. But how come it's OK for a man to concentrate on his work in order to heal, but not OK for a woman? Not all of we women are whimpering crybabies, and emotional fulfillment comes in many forms."
5,5 STARS!!!!,"after going thru a painful divorce with children involved i found myself lost, alot of unexplainable emotions, this book sat on my book shelf for months, as i passed by it one day i picked it up and started reading it, and all i can say is WOW, it helps you connect soo much with-in yourself, when ur feeling, sad, angry, u have all these questions.. i strongly recommend this book it's helped me cope and continue to do soo..."
3,"Great Book, poor audiobook and Audible Graphics are terrible",This is a great book from a great author. I have two problems with it. The heeling bedtime stuff needs to be it's own file and separate from the rest of the main content. Listening to that and not wanting to be distracted while driving to fast forward is just a mess. I listened to the whole 9+ hours of the unabridged Men are from Mars.... without problem. The going to sleep stuff in the middle of the file was a problem for me. The rest of the content is good. Whoever decided to put such terrible low resolution as to be almost unreadable graphics on the Audible version needs to be fired. The Men are from Mars.... unabridged audiobook graphics from iTunes put this garbage graphics to shame. Some of the content is recycled from Men are from Mars.... and this book only really deeply works as a companion to the master book.
3,Gives you the control back,Who doesnt want step by step instructions and a cheer leader along the way. This book gives you that. Makes you understand and go HHHMMMM so thats why he does that.
5,Really helped me,"I got this book to help myself recover from divorce, but I ended up getting in touch with many other life losses that needed healing too. It was very helpful for me. I especially liked the effectiveness of the Feeling Letters exercise. I started with a mess of emotions, and end up at a place of forgiveness and healing. This book validates your feelings and not only gives you permission to embrace them, but says you must experience them fully in order to let them go. Good information and valuable exercises."
1,Not helpful,"If I could give less than 1 star I would. The book is repetitive and written in a simple minded fashion to a point that comes across as insulting. John Gray appears to inentionally fill pages by ""bold typing and underlining"" repeat phrases on almost every page. This book could not possibly bring help to anyone. You can learn more from watching daytime TV than you can from this book. A total waste of money."
2,Dr. Gray in another of his Mars Venus books,These books are getting old. Same story as the last... same story as the next. Easiest way to get over someone is to get under someone ELSE!
1,Egomaniacal author and too many typos,"I recently had the experience of seeing John Gray give a talk...and if this guy isn't an ego maniac, I don't know who is. Some of his information is good, but he purports to know far more than he really does. This book has SOME good information for people like myself who are experiencing divorce for the first time, but most of it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. I believe John Gray simplifies emotions and matters of the heart far too much and shouldn't be prescribing such in depth exercises to people with no psychological support, as the repercussions can run deep. I would recommend ""Coming Apart: Why relationships end and how to get through the ending of yours"" by Daphne Rose Kingma instead."
5,Great buy and great fun!,"This is a great product and a fantastic value too. The pockets are big enough for little ones to get into easily, and it comes with a nice assortment of accessories, all of which are carried by parents too(toys, diapers, lotion, bottle). It is a very nice size - big enough to put a couple doll outfits and the accessories in but small enough for a 2 year old to easily carry. Highly recommend it!"
5,Cutest ever !,"This is just the cutest little play diaper bag ever. My daughter has it to go with her Little Mommy Play All Day Toddler. They go perfect together. The bag is pretty, and has very cute, realistic, no mess accessories. It's also nice because we also keep all the extras that came with her doll in it. My daughter is only 2, but it is very easy for her to open up, and she spends lots of time useing it to tend to her little one. It also has a flap that opens for a changing pad on it. I don't think my daughter would have near the fun with her doll without the diaper bag too. I think any little girl would love it!"
5,Great Price,"My daughter used these dance shoes for 3 years- all during her high school years. I am so glad that we found them on AMazon. She stil has them ans is taking them to college with her , where she will be dancing as well."
4,Great tribute to Cannonball's music,"I liked this one very much. I think that Mike Smith has a little bit of the ""sax appeal"" ussualy associated to so-called smooth jazz, but he's never far from the real thing, in this case the great tunes and style of Cannonball Adderley. Great album!"
2,Forever War this isn't!,"""Forever War"" is truly a masterpiece. This is not ""Forever War."" It is not even up there with ""World Without End,"" another Haldeman Trek novel. The failings of this book are several. What at first seems like a neat adventure story - Kirk and the gang weaponless and stranded on a planet with large, canivorous beasts - becomes instead yet another occassion when a ""superior"" race feels the need to test humans (this time, fortunately, without Abraham Lincoln). Ho, hum."
4,Glad I'm Not In Politics,"Simon Lincoln has got to be the wickedest villain/manipulator I've read about in a long time. Rather scary that I was drawn to his every next move. Even though the story contains many political complexities, I thought the plots were fast-paced, interesting and easy to follow. A fast ""escape"" read."
5,One of the best freestyle albums I've listened to.,"""Thinking About You"", ""It Wasn't Enough"", and ""No Holding Back"" are my favorites. It's great that Cynthia finally came back after a long time away. The beats are tight and the lyrics are so touching, I almost cried! It's too bad there aren't any stations in my area playing freestyle anymore, it's a great genre of music."
5,couldn't be better!,"Cynthia's new CD is perfect! I love ""Thinking About You"" and ""It wasn't enough"". Anyone notice that the intros to the two songs are alike? I've only been a freestyle fan for about 2 years, so I am enjoying its comeback! And Cynthia is the best there is, she's the Queen of Freestyle! And she sticks with her odl school freestyle sound, which helps on her perfection. Come on... more freestyle...the music world needs it! Anyone who wants plenty of Cynthia's music and other freestyle go listen to New York's 103.5 KTU! It's great!"
5,BEST FREESTYLE ARTIST ALBUM!,"This is the best cd i ever got that was freestyle. Cynthia sings freestyle,and her whole cd is like almost all freestyle wit some tyte beats. My favorite song on the cd is IF I HAD THE CHANCE that had a tight beat, and so did THINKING ABOUT YOU! Like other artists liek ANGELINA, they dont compare to CYNTHIA because her whole cd is good and probably only has 1 or 2 songs that arnt. Overall i give this a 5 star because its tight, shes koo so its all good. Compare this to JOCELYN and BUFFY and all them other freestyles they dont come close to bein better than CYNTHIA unless they come up with some tight shiet. Go out to the cd store and grab her album! and anotehr thing it downst sound like 80s music like other freestyles."
4,"!QUE VIVA EL ""FREESTYLE""! ME ENCANTA","I WENT TO THE STORES HUNGRY FOR MORE NEW FREESTYLES RELEASES, BUT THEY ALWAYS SHOW ME THE SAME FREESTYLE CD'S 1 TO 10 VOLUME OF THE BEST FREESTYLE. WHEN I SAW THIS NEW CYNTHIAS CD I COULDNT BELIEAVE IT. ITS REALLY GREAT! I THOUGHT HERE IN PUERTO RICO FREESTYLE WAS DEAD, BUT I WAS WRONG."
1,boring,"overall, I think her CD is quite boring. There is no creativity in any songs on the album, and she lacks vocal ability in her new album.I have previous Cynthia releases up to ner new album release and quite frankly, I am dissapointed.I happen to feel that she is a great girl in reading her interviews and if she went into other music it would be better for her."
5,thinking of Cynthia.....,"This is the best Cynthia cd. Now Cynthia is a freetyle queen and always has been anyone from Miami or New York can confim it! This is where freestyle began, but technically it started in New York. Then eventually also based out of Miami w/ a different sound. There is a difference between N.Y. and Miami sounding freestyle. However, this cd appeals to both. The VERY 1st single was ""How I Love Him"" f/k7, also known as Kayel, lead singer of the ever-popular freestyle group TKA. other hit releases include: ""Like A Star"", ""If I Had The Chance"", ""Thinking About You"", ""I Never Said"". All which are great songs and of course thier is another personal favorite of mine....""Save Your Love For Me"". There's of course other great hits but you'll have to discover them for yourself!...ENJOY!"
2,NO DEAL HERE!!!,"I ordered 10 of the Kingston Technology 512 MB MicroSD Memory Cards at $2.64 a piece. I thought this was a great deal and figured that the shipping might be high. I figured I might pay as high as $52+ because of the low price, so I used the one click order method. Boy was I wrong! Shipping for each of these items is over $5 a piece. My $26.40 became $77+ with shipping. When I e-mailed BlueProton, I included my e-mail address and phone number, so we could negotiate the shipping price. I also said that if they would not come down on the shipping and handling costs, that they could cancel the order, which they did without contacting me. So, I gave them a 2 instead of a 1. BEWARE!!!!!!!"
3,Not Deep Enough,"The skimmer has a decent (not great) size head, but it is not deep enough. I use this for fishing ravioli out of boiling water, and it takes 3 times as long as it used to when I had my other skimmer. It's a shame really. The skimmer has a nice handle and weight. They could have made the head deeper."
1,Wish i could leave NO stars,"Poor quality product. Not worth your time or money. Also, bad customer service and very hard to deal with 47th St. Photo. NEVER AGAIN!"
1,Does NOT fit on the Kodak Z740,"I'm not sure if they sent us the wrong product or not, but these lenses do NOT fit on a Kodak Z740. The box looks the same as in the picture. The lenses are much too large. I guess if I wanted to hold one up all the time with my other hand, I could use them.If you are wanting something to go on your Z740, don't bother with these!!"
5,perfect,Bought this exhaust for a 2003 Dodge Ram Quad cab. Was able to install it myself with no problems. It is loud and sounds tough which is exactly what we were looking for.
2,good if you like sand,"These dates suck. Dates are an awesome, mystery fruit...but not these. Half the bag is comprised of soft, delicious date chunks. The other half is comprised of hard date sand granules. Don't buy these. Go for Dole or Sunmaid."
3,"Skip the massive booklet, enjoy the music.","I was very glad to see this material finally see the light of day. Unfortunately, the CD comes with a completely inappropriately written booklet, in which her ""associate"" David Evans takes the opportunity to write a love letter to the forgotten Michael Hannah and alternately trash and/or ignore Twinkle. What Evans failed to realize is that SHE is the reason people would buy this collection, not the title grifter. Evans treats the 40+ page booklet as a trial run for his memoirs (including a full page picture of himself). Twinkle had no input.About the music - it doesn't disappoint. A few of these tracks did appear on the Golden Lights compilation. The rest of the material is of the same quality. They have done a great job with remastering and restoring the damaged tapes. So listen to the music of Twinkle and skip the ugly booklet."
1,Don't waste your money,"Everybody can get sucked in to buying a product by just the brand name. Overall, skintimate products are the best of the best. But I have to say that i was awfully disapointed with the Skintimate Moisturizing After-Shave Gel. This Gel made my legs sting something awful. I disliked it so much that i didn't even check to see if it actually made my legs smooth or not. And my friend tried it even when she did not shave and it still stung, so the irritation from shaving is not the reason. I also don't have sensitive skin so I can't even imagine how it would be if you did. Please take my advice and skip this product."
4,Great cooking tool!,"This wok changed the way I cook. I absolutely love using it. It cooks my food so nicely and has allowed me to do so many tasty new recipes. I hate cleaning it up, but that's my fault for cooking things that get stuck in it, like overheating soy sauce and doing stir fried rice. Indeed, cleaning it up isn't so bad, just throw some water in, bring it to boiling, and scrape it with a spatula!This wok got a bit of negative comments due to the ""seasoning process"" and the instructions around it. When I made the purchase, the seller (The Wok Shop) emailed me some instructions which were a bit hard to follow. HOWEVER, when the wok actually arrive, there were printed instructions which were GREAT. No problems at all following them! I seasoned it quickly, in about an hour (I used the oven method), and the pan is really great to cook in as a result.J.Ja"
5,Carbon Steel Wok,"Although I haven't gotten past the seasoning stage and I'm no expert, this wok seems like it's good quality (especially for the price). If it melts or falls apart, which I doubt, I'll post a follow-up."
5,16 inch Wok,The wok is a good weight and perfect size without being to big. So far so good in food production.
4,Top Notch Wok,"Great product! I only gave it 4 stars as opposed to 5 because as many people stated, it has to be ""seasoned."""
2,Half-Right,"Calling the CD ""Greatest Hits 1960"" is only half-right. Half of those songs are from 1958, 1959 or 1961. And ""original artists"" is not to be interpreted as ""original versions."" Unless you don't mind hearing remakes, look for a CD with the original hits."
3,No Love Me Tender for this series.,"""OK, but the recordings are not high quality and the tunes are not really the top 20 for the year. One youg man, with sideburns, is not on any of these recordings. No Love Me Tender for this series."""
3,None the original hit recordings,"As one who owns many of the originals, recognize re-recordings with fewer musicians and generally slower tempos throughout. That noted, not bad re-creations. If you have not heard for a half-century, OK tracks--would eagerly go to see these in revival concert performance."
3,Covers a lot of ground without going indepth.,"If you have never read any books on apologetics, this would be a good book to start with. If you are already familiar with, or enjoy the depth to books, such as those by Dallas Willard, Gregory Boyd, or CS Lewis, you may find find this book a bit dissapointing with it's covering-a-lot-of-ground, but only scratching-the-surface style."
2,Missed Opportunity,"As much as I love ZZ Top, and that love is great,I can't recommend this DVD because all it has arethe videos. Whoever produced this DVD should takea lesson from, say, the Chemical Brothers DVD, whichshines because it contains a killer LIVE section.What's the use of a ZZ Top DVD that only has the videos?One's reaction to this tends to be: who cares?However, IF this DVD had contained a LIVE offering,then I'm sure it would've been among my favorite DVDs of all time.Hopefully in the near future ZZ Top will release a fantasticLIVE DVD.............please!"
3,"[Three-and-a-half stars ouf of Four] Very fine video collection but like Cheap Trick, not complete Argghhh!","I espeically like TV Dinners but whereare the ones for Back to the Future III& 'Arrested for driving while...' LikeCheap Trick, the second oldest US band,ZZ-Top did 'Pre-MTV' vids too. I guessthey are lost forever..."
3,The little helper for the big jobs,"This product does the big jobs as such the other do. I'm well pleased with the results of this item, no regrets at all."
3,Will not work with Husqvarna 128LD,Purchased this pole saw to use with my Husqvarna 128LD trimmer. This attachment will not work with that trimmer although the photograph under the 128 LD trimmer on Husqvarna's website shows this pole saw as an attachment.
5,"A wonderfully practical, helpful, and informative manual","This manual is excellent for dealing with possible tutor-tutee or tutor-parent issues. It covers everything, including differences in race, gender, religion, socio-economic status, and sexual orientation. I found it extremely helpful in my tutoring ""career,"" and it has helped me better relate to and motivate my students."
2,Biased,"I've been looking for resources for tutors for my University Writing Center, and I came across _Tutoring Matters_. Of particular interest to me is chapter 4: ""Race, Gender, Class, and Background Differences."" However, I was quickly taken aback by the obvious assumptions the writers make about their audience, particularly that the tutors are middle or upper-middle class and white.Some of the advice in the book is quite practical, but as a professor at an HBCU, I will pass on this resource, and I would recommend that others who work in a diverse environment consider insteadThe Allyn & Bacon Guide to Peer Tutoring, Second EditionorLongman Guide to Peer Tutoring (2nd Edition)."
4,"Not as useful as I thought, but still good","Book came pretty fast. Read it through in several sittings. Not what I hoped, but better than the others out there. Definitely a good investment! Good to look back on."
3,Johnstone is Johnstone,"Johnstone is Johnstone...either you like him or you don't, he keeps it just interesting enough and cheap enough to keep me buying."
2,Hmmm...,"I bought this book because a friend recommended it to me. It is hard to interpret and no matter how many times I've looked at it or read it, I still feel like the only 3 lines I can for sure read are my life, head, and heart. The images are very basic with a hand outline and the colored lines drawn on to that outline. It teaches you the basics (i.e. finger names, mounts, and basic lines) but pretty much ends there. I've had it for about 1 year now, looked at it a several times, and have decided to invest in either a class or a couple of different books. There is no way one could accurately read some body from this book."
1,Horrible Book,"This book in not for a novice. It is for the advanced and even then it leaves so much out. The pictures didn't help and weren't explained much but rather used in examples...how would one begin to understand the basics? I'm sure there are better books.Also, there's no actual photos of real hands (except for one)-- all illustrations are drawn-- which on any real hand it's pretty rare to have the lines neatly and evenly drawn like that of a neatly drawn line colored illustration."
1,Way more complex than I ever imagined.,"If you are looking for a book to give you simple ideas and formulas for reading palms, this is not the book. Palm reading is way more complicated than I would have ever imagined, and if youre not willing to spend hours and hours of study, this book is not for you. Anyone interested in the basics to use as a sort of party trick, you're probably better off finding something for free on The Google."
5,"Excellent Writing, Interesting, and Informative","I really enjoyed this book. Lots of ""meat"" to the book. Concepts and ""rules"" are repeated and reinforced over the course of the book in various scenarios which make for excellent retention. Also, there's a few sample analysis of actual life size hand prints which i don't see too often in other books.Can't say it answers all my questoins or probelms with the body of knowledge but definitely gained from this book. - Daniel Mokhtar"
2,"No es lluvia, sino llovizna.","Soy de los lectores raros que buscan libros que no sean bestsellers, que no vengan de autores conocidos y que no lleguen a mi por un plan de mercadeo. Así encuentra uno grata sorpresas, pero también libros que no debieron publicarse. Este es un punto intermedio entre esos dos extremos. Cuando empecé a leerlo me quedé sorprendido. El primer cuento muestra a un escritor maduro, que tiene su propio lenguaje y transporta al lector a su realidad. Sin embargo, no todos los cuentos, si se les puede llamar cuentos, son así. Hay algunos que están en el libro como para llenar espacio. Hay otros que empiezan, flotan sin rumbo y no llegan a ningún lado. Este escritor tiene potencial, pero necesita disciplina."
2,i10 stereo phone review,"The Koss, I10 stereo phone is an inexpensive product you can purchase. However, the item is made out of plastic, which could break easily and has a poor fitting comfort ability. The fit is not too comfortable because I10 does not fit the shape of your head too well (at least it doesn¡t fit mine too well). The product comes with 0.25-inch and 0.125-inch jacks for your Home-Stereo and also for your CD/Cassette. The 0.25-in. jack fits into the top of 0.125-in jack with easy changing capability. The sound quality is decent and I think it¡s worth the purchase within its price range because I10 stereo phone was the cheapest item I found among all other stereo phones. One more thing, the color is greenish-blue and it¡s transparent. The design of the item is pretty poor, but it¡s still unique."
5,Great resource,"As a special education teacher I have worked with hundreds of students with reading and learning disabilities. Many of my students have been helped with the colored overlays and gone on to have their lenses tinted. This book outlines a treatable visual perceptual disorder which is so often overlooked. It may not be the only reason a student has reading difficulties, but for many students using the overlays can have a significant improvement on their reading."
4,Living by the colors,I found the book very informative. Our J.C tested me for scoptic sensitivity syndrom and found I am one of the people who have this syndrom. In the testing I saw red dots in the number 8 for example. We choose the turquoise color film to help with my reading and pehaps use blue paper to do my homework on. I havent decided about the glasses as of yet. To bad I didnt have this information sooner as I am a 67 year old student.
2,Controversial,"This method may or may not work, but ALL parents of children with reading difficulties should know that this is considered a CONTROVERSIAL treatment method by the International Dyslexia Association."
1,Another failed magic bullet,While very profitable to it's developers this method does NOT really help kids in 99% of reading disability cases. So why is it so popular? because it offers an easy explanantion and a cure...
1,STALE!!!!,"I am probably the biggest fan of this stuff. However, this batch was def stale.....Certainly not enjoyable or moist in any fashion. To make it more of a mystery, the best by date is cut off. Its on the very bottom left corner, but I cant see the date. Ugh :-("
1,Read this important note before you buy...,"It's a superb selection of pieces... But orchestation arrays, the conduction and the adding of ""the gentle lapping of the waves and cooing of seaguls"" are regrettably simple and rustic.I didn't notice those ""effects adding"", so I've bought a product different to my usual preferences.It is a ""relaxation"" product, rather than a Classical Selection."
3,"Good product, as usual","This is another well made Arc'teryx product. The fleece makes a great layer for warmth when used with a shell and is well designed. The fit seems a bit large for a medium (I'm 6' and 165lb and it fits a bit loosely), but that's typically true of Arc'teryx.I guess I didn't give it 4 (or 5) stars because it is extremely simple for the amount of money it costs. I have several Arc'teryx products (backpacks and jackets) and have always found the high price has been worth the quality of product I get, but I found the trade-off to be lacking here. There seems to be nothing that makes this fleece standout from other fleeces in the higher-end outdoor clothing market, yet it is priced significantly higher. I've seen fleeces made from other companies such as Patagonia that would undoubtedly do the same job functionally, but look and fit much nicer - all for at or below the price of this fleece. I guess for this price, I expect a bit more."
3,Beware - quality. No longer made in Canada,"Beware. Arc'teryx sold out to Adidas (some time ago) and the quality is slowly starting to revert to that of Adidas. All manufacturing is now outsourced to China and Vietnam. This product is made in China. I own many Ayc'teryx products (all with the made in Canada on the label) and have previously been happy with paying the premium price for the quality, and the quality and economic benefits that come from being made in the Americas. No longer will I pay that premium."
2,Overpriced fleece,"You are paying for the brand Arc'teryxIt is made in China, not that anything is wrong with China made stuff; but I would expect the labor costs to be lower there and that will translate into lower cost of the sweater......but no, the sweater price at around $150 is steepI bought it because I don't have much of this brand and the arm pocket design and overall designDon't plan to buy moreIt looks fine, the fleece is a little thin, think 70 degree weather, it would be fine, anything cooler, need something thickerFor this price, buy a North Face Denali jacket, you get much heftier fleece (I already got two Denali's one in black and the other in grey)Anyway, that's the gist of it...buying the brand and design"
3,Did not WOW me.,Overall this product is okay. The pocket on the sleeve is a nice feature.I did not like this product in the gray color. The good thing is that the collar does not stick up when partially unzipped. It folds back but if you like to leave the collar open (as my husband does) then it shows where the black inner collar lining is stitched in against the gray - looks like a raw hem stitch and makes the overall appearance seem unfinished.My husband has thick arms so he did not like the elastic around the wrists.This looked more like a knit sweater than a fleece. It looked knitted.Not was I was expecting.
4,Nice overview of a second tier band.,"Jukebox Hits gives a nice overview of Erskine Hawkins' work from 1940-1950.Hawkins and his band never hit the dizzying heights of such bands as Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Benny Goodman, The Dorseys or Count Basie (to name a few of the superstars of the time) but was a solid working band of the era.The style ranges from big band to swing to bebop to pop corn (Tennessee Waltz is atrociously cornball).The musicianship is first-rate and the instrumental numbers are great but the vocal tunes are not up to the same standard.Unfortunately some of the recordings are scratchy and/or tinny.There are also decent liner notes and information for each song."
3,"Begins as Comedy, Ends as Soap Opera","I love well-written, well-acted shows that make me laugh. Cold Feet began that way, and the first disc of the first season is by far the best. However, the series develops into more soap opera than comedy. Lots of affairs, betrayals & cliffhangers. This pattern continues and intensifies in the rest of the seasons (2-5). If you like soaps, definitely buy this DVD set and the rest in the series. If you prefer comedy, rent the first disc and stop there."
5,Beautiful,"Totally simple, i all aspects, this book is gorgeous. My three year old is entranced every time we read it, as am I. Beautiful."
5,Magical for a young boy,"I bought the board book version of this story for my 6 year old son a year or two ago when I was in England. He absolutely loved it. He wss looking for it recently - he's now 8 - and we couldnt find it, so I bought another copy for him recently, as well as another of Jeffers books. After reading them my son proclaimed he wants all of Oliver Jeffers books!Beautifully written and illustrated."
5,Gorgeous Illistration,"Read this book to my 4 year old little guy. The pictures engaged him and the story made him turn each page quickly and with anticipation. This is a great book. This is our first book from Mr. Jeffers, looking forward to purchasing more."
1,Size problem,"Big problem with this item, I expected to have the same size as ""How to catch a star"" and ""The way back home"" but having the hard cover, but the surprise was to receive a really small book. Not very useful to use in classes since it's too small to show in front of a class. Not very happy with it."
4,"great for home, class and library use","As a school librarian, I have found this resource an excellent one. It has quick ideas to make reading fun and also challenges kids to develop researching skills."
1,timely delivery-poor quality merchandise,"From the packaging, it was obvious that this laptop was broken when it shipped. It looked like it had been dropped on its corner, the case was broken, it was difficult to open the screen and there is a loose piece of something rattling around inside. It won't even complete the POST, it starts and then shuts off. I bought this as a gift, now I'm empty-handed. I would never buy from this group again."
5,Great Read,"For readers who like to know what goes on behind the scenes in the business of sports, this book is just the ticket. What struck me is the readability -- like a novel -- and I learned a great deal about the characters involved in high-profile decision-making, and how power is wielded. Highly recommended."
3,Check Out My Reasoning Here,"I don't HAVE this item; how can I trust them? Are these the original hits? Why do I ask? ""Sheila"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""Anyday Now"", ""The One Who Really Loves You"", ""Sheila"" and ""Only Love Can Break a Heart"" came out in 1962, not 1963. Look it up. And while ol' Ace Cannon is still out touring over 40 years after ""Tuff"", his version of ""Frankie and Johnny"", the standard first done by the father of country music Jimmy Rodgers some 70 years ago, was NOT a ""greatest"" hit in 1963 for anybody, nor was ""Do the Bird"" nor ""Don't Say Goodnight...."" (The Shirelles were fading but it was their ""Foolish Little Girl"" that was a 1963 hit). Buyer beware!"
3,"some original recordings, others are not","A nice collection but not all of the songs are original recordings. ""Keep Searchin"", ""Deep Purple"", ""Da Do Ron Ron"", ""Thou Shalt Not Steal"", and ""Sheila"" were recorded in stereo years after the songs were hits. Deluxe/Highland Music has other series that have a mixture of original hits and re-recordings. You can do better than buy this."
3,Where IS That Darn Ice Cream Man Anyway?,"I found it interesting to see a story set in Tel Aviv that told of the lives of modern Israelis as other than individuals whose daily existences are mired in the shadow of ever-present terrorism and omnipresent political turmoil. Except for the language differences, these people could as easily have been western Europeans or even Americans. There was good acting here, a lot of multi-faceted female characters, and a strong sense of ""what next?"" that pulled my interest along. What did bother me was the way the story ultimately reminded me so much of the experimental European cinema of past generations in the way it flirted with symbolism and even magic realism (my number one least favorite way to tell a tale). What was left was a movie that was stronger for its visuals and characters than its actual plotlines, and so what might have been a four-star picture became something less in the final tally."
2,faulty part,"had it installed and it cycled out so i was able to get the car inspected but the light came back on 5 days later, then went out 6 days later, then came back on in 7 days and has been on for the past 2 weeks. I'm wondering if this is normal or if the part is defective. I would like to have a new one sent to me, i believe the part is faulty."
3,Be careful -- some of this info is outdated,"The only reason I gave this book three stars is that most of this info regards GNU/Linux systems that are running a 2.2 kernel. The book points out in its text that the 2.4 kernel is upcoming. As I write this, the 2.4 kernel has been around for years now, and the 2.6 kernel (non-testing) is on its way. Likewise, some non-kernel material is also *completely outdated* (sound card configuration and NFS spring to mind). This book doesn't even mention kudzu, which is the bread & butter of RedHat, Knoppix, Mandrake, etc. Another way to put this: if kudzu can't autoconfigure your ISA hardware, this book may help.However, the material in this book which is still relevent is worthwhile. If the author releases an updated edition, I'd be very tempted to buy it."
5,This book changed my life,"I read this manual from the net like a year ago, It was the first time that I felt confortable to throw away MS systems, I'm so happy to see it again and updated.It teachs you to do thing the hard and the easy way, so you never get lost again.Paul is a great system operator and a great teacher."
5,"Not only a highly instructive story, but a page-turner","It's rare that a book on business and technology reads like a thriller, but Dealers of Lightning does. I never would have thought that the story of PARC could be a cliffhanger, but Hiltzik (the writer) manages to portray the saga as one of an elemental battle between the forces of progress and the stultification of the corporate mentality. Even for those who know how the story turns out (I did, in general terms at least) you read on and on and on, hooked, to watch it unfold."
5,Absolutely Fascinating,"Xerox opened PARC in 1970, Palo Alto Research Center, a team of computer prodigies who would invent:--Smalltalk--Alto--EthernetAt the end of 1979 Steve Jobs was given a demonstration. The book's timeline ends with Apple's 1984 Macintosh."
2,I was frustrated by this longwinded account of Xerox/PARC,"The one-sided ""positive"" viewpoint that Michael Hiltzik presented in ""Dealers of Lightning"" was very frustrating. As I read through the -- admittedly very interesting -- history of PARC, I kept waiting for Hiltzik move away from his glowing historical account to some new insights into Xerox's inability to implement PARC's achievements."
2,Dealers of Lightning,"After reading Dealers of Lightning, I wondered whether or not Xerox had commissioned it. Michael Hiltzik is supposedly a Pulitzer nominated journalist. But this book is all softball. If you're interested in the real story of PARC, both the extraordinary and the all too ordinary, warts and all, read Fumbling the Future by Douglas Smith and Robert Alexander. It has been an underground classic for more than a decade and, after reading Dealers, I see why."
1,Missing Pages RIPOFF,"This book came with only the main text. The Kindle copy was missing beginning matter pages (Title, CopyRight,Cast of Characters and Timeline) and I have not gotten to the end, so i assume it is missing all the end-notes (Afterlives to Index).Without the Cast of Characters and Timeline it is difficult to follow the complicated plot reality.The truncation is most UNSCHOLARLY, but I do not know if this is Amazon or HarperCollins or both faults.In addition, the Kindle copy is essentially the same price as the paper edition: that is the RIPOFF!"
1,A major part of the story is missing.,"A major part of the story is missing. The mouse and many other personal computing innovations actually began with Doug Engelbart and his lab at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). At the Joint Computer Conference in 1968, Englebart and his SRI team debuted the mouse, the graphical user interface, windows, networking, e-mail, and video- conferencing. The ideas came to PARC as former SRI researchers started working there in early 70's."
5,Read this novel. You will enjoy it!,"An exciting novel of intrigue set in Eastern Europe at the height of the Cold War. Travel with the hero - a United States Diplomat - throughout West/East Germany, Hungary, Greece, the United States, and the Soviet Union as he searches for a mysterious musical manuscript. His adventures and experiences serving as a United States diplomat in various countries in Europe contain all of the elements of a diplomatic thriller. You will enjoy this novel. The story is creative and interesting."
3,Great Movie,I really like this movie especially since it was filmed on my street! Elvis is big in memphis and it depicted it well. Great movie!
5,The Grace of Graceland,"Altho Harvey Keitel bears no resemblance to Elvis' gorgeous image, he pulls off a wonderful performance of the essence of Elvis. I loved this movie and know Elvis would have truly loved the message. It stayed with me long after it ended. Bridget Fonda does a pretty good Marilyn and Jonathon Schaech is just plain handsome. Definitely an intriguing, wonderfully written script leaving your heart warm. If you are an Elvis fan this one will touch you in a special way."
1,broke immediately,"Constructed hammock stand properly, sat in hammock and stand immediately broke. The wood is cheap and snapped in half. I would not recommend this product."
1,Insult of the century earrings,"After finally locating these earrings in their little blue pouch, I felt like I had been played for a fool. Some things should not even be sold unless an absolutely full disclosure is made in describing them, without using typical marketing euphemisms such as ""dainty"". These earrings resembled tiny flecks of aluminum foil. I really felt hurt and insulted that anyone would claim that their value was so high and that the reduced price was a mere $119.99. And when you hear the word ""diamond"" and pay over $100.00 for a pair of earrings, don't you think you should at least have them arrive in a pretty velvet box? Regardless of the product desciption of the packaging, I know I deserve better for my money, and the tiny pouch only added insult to injury. Please don't buy these, unless you are prepared to be very disappointed."
5,Fun way to learn Spanish!,"The stories are interesting, and this is a great way to build vocabulary and learn how to say things the way native Spanish-speakers do. There is a glossary in the back and notes on special idioms and interesting points of history or culture. So you don't have to carry along a Spanish dictionary to learn and enjoy!"
3,Decent book (i guess),"Good book all around. Although my favorite part was the comparing of chicago-style pizza to a casserolem which is very true (but it's not neccisarily a bad thing).for all you venting chicago-ites (or whatever) who wrote in the previous reviews saying that casserole comparison was utter blasphemy, consider this exerpt from wikipedia, the world's largest free encylopedia:""The Chicago-style pizza varies from the traditional pizza in that it shares more in common with a casserole such as lasagna than with a hearth cake type dish.""don't believe me? go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Style_Pizzaanyways....3 stars for good effort although some of the pizza places he mentioned were'nt all that great."
2,Dim idea,"This little light is overintroduced. It might do in a pinch, but it puts out very little light and the color of the light is not pleasing. Too cool and blue for my taste. I have it on my violin music stand as a secondary and it is not very useful. Defintely not what I was led to expect from the product."
3,alright,"I bought two of these, one had bright white leds, the other less-bright a tiny bit yellowish leds - go figure; I would have expected to get two exactly the same as that is what I ordered."
2,Mighty Bright is Mighty Disappointing,"At first I really liked this book light. It has a small but bright beam. I had hoped it was going to be of better quality then book lights which I've had in the past which were defective and broke after relatively short use. Alas no. After only owning it for 2 months and using it moderately once or twice a week, the Mighty Bright broke so that the light only worked if you fiddled around with the top movable piece, and put it in just the right position. In any other configuration the light no longer comes on."
3,Not USA Made Wok,"My favorite thing about this wok is the ""Made in Taiwan"" stamp. It's clearly not made in the USA (3rd time this has happened to me in the past year on scAmazon). Anyway - the Wok is decent so I'll probably keep it, even though I feel kinda cheated."
4,As advertised...I think,"We needed a flat bottom wok and didn't notice in the ad that this was round bottom (our fault). Never used it and gave it to our daughter who has not used it yet either, will follow up later with more on this item. Better instructions on proper ""seasoning"" of the wok would have been good too."
5,CD,Bought this for a couple having a 50th wedding anniversary (married in 1958). They loved it! Fun music of that era great for a party too.
1,Poorly researched...flat writing...,"Having done research on the protagonist Ah Toy, I can assure you that she was not the kind, motherly character as portrayed in this book. If that wasn't bad enough, the imagined love story is simply boring. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone interested in Chinese-American history."
3,not bad,"It was a look back into the early days in California history and the oriental community. It was pretty well researched, but at times a little confusing. I picked this up to know more about the main character, but came away still wondering who she was."
5,History of Chinese immigration during the goldrush equals a Great book,Enjoyed the integration of the chinese people into the gold rush. Women had it tough in China and America offered a newfreedom never imagined. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the gold rush days.
1,disappointing,"This only has 10 minutes of footage about Columbine. The rest of the dvd is about other news topics. Also, it does not have any live footage of Dylan's mom being interviewed. It just takes quotes from what she has written."
4,"Nelson isn't Patrick O'Brian, he may be superior in his way.","This is the third of a triology which will now have a sequel. Having read all of O'Brian's books, I found Nelson a pleasant change of pace. The story covers detail of the first exploits of the American Navy which moves at a pace not found in O'Brian's books. You won't find information on the variety of seagulls observed during the voyage, but the void is filled with more interesting insights of historical note. I recommend this series as an outstanding opportunity to enjoy a phase of American history not previously explored in my readings."
4,A novel set in the opening days of the American Revolution,"Generally this is a good historical novel, and has more naval action than the author's last novel. The main problem is the author's refusal to allow the loss of a ship (and the main character's assignment to another ship). The story starts with an improbable, larger-than-life, rescue of the ship from where it was beached at the end of the previous novel. Making things too larger-than-life detracts from an otherwise good story. It is a good account of the creation of a fledgling navy. The politics described were a continuing problem for the young U.S. Navy for a long period of time, e.g., the appointment of officers based on connections rather than ability."
4,The Continental Risque,The book was in very good shape and was delivered in a timely manner. I would order from this provider again.
3,Good for introduction to CNY crafts,"If you are new to celebrating CNY or want to introduce the holiday to children who've never celebrated, then this book may point you in the right direction. If you are familiar with CNY, then these crafts aren't anything you wouldn't have thought of on your own.Includes very basic instructions for banners, paper fire crackers for holding candy, puppets, lanterns, noisemakers etc. The illustrations are good, and the materials are things that you would probably have around the house already.I'm always looking for good crafts to do with our cross-cultural family, but this book was just too basic."
3,Isaac Bashevis Singer,"I was assigned this book as part of a study/discussion group. While I enjoyed most of the stories, what I enjoyed most was Singer's style of writing capturing my interest from the very beginning even with the stories I did not care for. I was not bored at all."
4,Wonderful tale telling history,"A collection of Jewish tales, essentially from Poland and full of the fatalistic themes permeating the diaspora, along with a spicy dash of the demonistic."
3,"Cheap price, cheap cue.",I got this cue because the price was unbeatable. The dark walnut color is really nice but the cue itself is not worth the price. Right out of the box the cue is not straight. There is a slight curve towards the end that is noticeable when the cue is rolled on a pool table. The joint connector is made of plastic. In fairness the cue did screw together with a flush seam and did have a good solid feel (no vibrations when used). Overall if the cue was straight it would be great. However because it is slightly curved I have to lower the rating to 3 stars. This cue is perfect for a cheap practice cue but not sure how well it will hold up with regular repeated use.
4,Decent stick,"Had to get some sticks for our new pool table and couldnt find any local, so went looking on Amazon. The grip is good and its a good size and weight. A little bent at the tip, but we replaced the tip and it seems pretty good. For the price you are paying, it is a good stick. I guess if you are looking for a straight cue, you should buy one in person. I am happy with the purchase"
4,good for the price,I don't know much about cue sticks but my son was pleased. I was able to get him two because of the great price.
1,Terrible Heart Rate Monitor,"Bought this because it looked cool and their higher end heart rate monitors were highly rated elsewhere. Big Mistake. This monitor cannot maintain a constant or accurate heart reading. It constantly goes back to zero, whether I am outside running or in a spinning class. Then if I get a reading, it is often obviously incorrect and then it sometimes freezes at my maximum reading, even after I have slowed to a cool down walk. Run away from this one. Get a Sports Instruments or Sigma instead."
1,Be careful about the price,These are available from the Lego website for $4.99 +tax and shipping. It's cheaper to get them directly from Lego even after shipping is added. The items on here carry the Lego name but I honestly believe they are cheapo 3rd party rip-offs. I compared what is sold here to the ones I purchased from Lego and they are not the same quality. These are much thinner and the one I purchased wasn't even cut square.Save yourself they money and order from Lego directly.
3,Deceiving,I don't remember if the ad gave the measurement on this product but I was shocked at how small it is. In the ad it looked larger.
3,Disappointed with the received product,I feel the same as the other person that commented. I thought it was the 15x15 plate and that is why I ordered it. I had previously ordered the large plate from Amazon directly and it was the much larger plate for the same price. I am very disappointed.
2,"Disappointed, flimsy","I read the reviews and decided to buy anyway, but these things really are flimsy. It's a shame no one carries the old, stiffer kind. Definitely measure the size, it looks smaller than you would think."
4,Flimsy!,The plate is a lot more flimsy than I expected! The ones I played with years ago were much sturdier and the base was thicker. It works fine for just building on but you can't build on it and carry it to show off your creation.
3,small,this is a great idea but needs to be bigger and less expensive - a larger size would save us from buying more - less is more in price
4,Gotta have the building plate,this is just a needed lego part. i wish they were made a little thicker; it seems like they could snap in two if you're not careful.
3,Doesn't work with Lego Friends Lego sets,I bought this for my daughter for her lego friends sets so she can keep them together easier but the lego friends legos do not connect to this so it was not worth it for my needs. I don't know if it works for the regular legos or not. I didn't think there would be a difference in the way they connect but maybe there is. I still feel these things are a little pricey though.
1,It is a complete rip-off!!,"This toy does not do anything! Who would want to pay seven dollars for this? If you're actually looking to buy this, let me warn you it's a ripoff."
3,Gray base plate is better!,"My daughter and I have found the 15X15"" baseplate a better size to make our structures on. If Lego would market an even huger one, my heart would be content!"
4,Big as described.,Exactly as described. Will not need another at all. However it is very thin. Must mount it to wood or have a child to be careful of breaking it in half.
2,lego base plate,"It really is not what I was looking for, but the children have found other uses for it."
1,Showing the pictures as if there are things more.,"It is more expensive than lego shop. The advertise picture showed more things on the plate, but there is only one plate. No fun! Disappointed!"
5,Let's see...,What do you do with this? Oh!!! It's a stamp! put some ink on the bump that says LEGO and keep on printing it on a piece of paper with five-hundred prints saying LEGO on them!!! What fun!!!
4,really great to have a base!,we never bought a base for our duplos and I wish we had because it is really nice to have a base for legos. Especially simply lego play. Easy to build a city with it.
4,Good product,This is a good overall product. Wish they had these when I was a kid. Its durable. Only downside is how much it costs. When did Legos become such an awful ripoff?
3,It's ok.,"This seems to be the exact same size as the one I had when I was a kid. It is good to have, and definitely better than not having one, but my sons would really like it to be much larger."
4,Goid base,"I'm going to hot glue to a piece of wood to make it more stable., otherwise it us a bit flimsy."
5,A must have,"If you love Legos just to build random things, this foundation is a must! Besides the kits, we love just building from a general box and we use these foundations for our creations."
3,Seriously overpriced,"There was nothing wrong with the product, per se, but be aware that it is grossly overpriced on Amazon. The exact same base can be bought from a Lego store for $4.99, as I found out to my dismay after purchasing one here. (By the way, I think it is perfectly valid for reviewers to downgrade a product for perceived lack of value as well as for flaws in the product itself, hence my rating.)"
4,Very practical and fun!,"My 8 year old daughter likes to play with LEGO, but used to build small items. As soon as this was in her hands she was building houses, hotels, cafeterias. Very fun to watch her let her imagination loose.I believe it promotes imagination games and fine motor skills. She loves this and me too!LEGO Green Building Plate (10"" x 10"")"
3,its okay,this is normal but size i was expecting bigger for some reason so next time i need to be careful with the size as indicated
3,Lackluster,"OK - it is thin. When I was a kid our platforms were as thick as the legos - so to me, this sucks...but as it is a present for a kid who only knows the crappy quality of today - I am hoping she likes it - but the smaller one that she already owns...she hates because the flex makes it unstable for building."
3,Okay,I'm sure my grandson will love it. It is just not a great value. Legos never are so I shouldn't complain.
3,Great size,"Bought four of these, and the kids love it. Perfect for them to build houses, buildings, etc on them. And less for us to clean up :)"
3,Decent but a little too flexible,"Apart from the relatively expensive price tag (which I guess you can pretty much get away with when there are no real alternatives) this board is more flexible and bendy than I would expect.When using it on carpet or a thick rug the board has so much give when fixing lego pieces to one area, that the surrounding areas flex so much that other pieces can come off and require refixing.Its not a great big deal since you can use it on a hard surface with no problems, and its not exactly a safety hazard, but its just annoying especially for smaller kids who want to play on the carpet/rug on the floor.I am also concerned that ultimately the board may crack due to the flexing, but until that happens I guess I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.Consider glueing it to a matching sized MDF or wood board for rigidity if it will only be used on rug/carpet."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY for Lego brand,"I purchased two of these for $9.99 each, expecting them to be firm enough to support a structure; now they are $4.97. BUT - they are not the typical Lego quality, not the rigid plate I have seen before. They are too thin to support even a small structure, unless it was unmoved after building; but that is the point of the base. They are frustrating for kids to use. They are either a knock-off or they are not Lego; I will have to investigate. Has anyone checked the current Lego brand bases; are they all this thin and flexible? Are there any other brands that would work and be rigid?"
3,To expensive,"The price, for a small piece of green plastic with bumps on it, is nuts. Although, that's true of most things that have ""Lego"" on them."
5,"Excellent, interesting, and useful",I bought this book and was amazed at how detailed it was! Dr. Sears is an expert on the body and how it works. I was reading it and then decided to get the digital download of this book. It was three hours long and this more suited my schedule to listen to it while driving rather than reading. It is an enlightening journey into the hormonal effect of food on the body. Suggest this book or the download if available.
5,Great,"This book is great as both an introduction programming to Flash MX and an introduction to Flash programming in general. MX introduces many new ways of working in Flash and this book covers them: components, listeners, callbacks, shared objects, local connection, etc. If you're familiar with Flash 5 and just starting in MX this book will get you up to speed quickly. If you're new to Flash or even new to programming this book will teach you everything you know. The first half goes over programming basics like variables, functions, dot syntax and data types, while introducing Flash specific programming such as MovieClips and built in objects like Math, Number and String. Later chapters lead you through hands on examples; you'll build sliders, custom cursors, slide shows and more using the latest abilities and coding conventions of Flash MX.Just about anyone can learn a thing or two about coding in Flash MX from this well written and easy to read book!"
1,"Pathetic, verbose, almost completely useless.","No stars. The text is too verbose, poorly organized and very confusing and downright cryptic. This is more on 'theory of programming' than hands-on work. The examples are non-existant, and the workshops hardly justify the price tag for this book.The author constantly refers to unintroduced topics and assumes reader knowledge for topics that are not even addressed till later in the book. For example, we have to get to chapter 10 before we actually set text in a text variable. This is advanced?The method of explaining is very confusing, very boring and very vague. I am up to chapter 12 now and I still cannot make head or tail of where the text is headed.Save you money. Don't buy this book.I will return it..."
2,CHEAP!!!!,"O.k. look it's a good toy, but ONLY FIVE LEVELS!! FOR FIFTY BUCKS!Its real cheap!:( My dad bought this for my little brother but the next day we turned it in, I passed this game in less than 10 minutes!! I RECOMMEND TO YOU, DON'T BUY IT! If you do I bet you will return it!!!!"
2,Explaining the unexplainable,"I have always enjoyed Barbara Michaels books, in fact AMMIE, COME HOME remains for me, one of the scariest novels I have ever read. OTHERWORLDS does not quite measure up.Using the point-of-view of both historical (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Harry Houdini), as well as fictional characters; two stories of supernatural visitation are presented to the group, and invited to be explained. Naturally, each person ""sees the elephant"" from their own perspective.The supernatural tales are intriguing, and slightly scary -- but not chilling, and in the end, are unresolved.This book was a disappointment, and I hope Barbara Michaels returns to form with her next effort."
1,Dissapointed!,"I had waited sooo long for this novel to come out, and when its all been read and done, it was bad. boring and slow, with no intrest at all the novel just never hit it off. I love Barbara Michaels, but this just was not her."
1,Is this Barbara Michaels?,"I have read all of Barbara Michael's books, and all I can say is what happened? After she has written so many excellent books I don't intend to give up on her, but I really hope her next book is nothing like this one."
3,Ignore the other comments you've read.,"Reviews of this book by long-time fans have been extremely negative. As nearly as I can figure, these criticisms boil down to disappointment in getting something different. These readers want a modern gothic romance, with a mildly neurotic heroine, and two attractive male protagonists.This book is different, and fresh, and more than a little frightening in spots. I read it in 2 nights, and enjoyed it very much. My only criticism is that story number 2 ends a little weakly."
3,Something Different from B. Michaels,"If you are looking for one of B. Michaels' formulaic gothic romance novels, skip this. If you are a little more opened minded, or a fan of classic ""true"" ghost stories, give it a try. The book sets forward the facts of, and offers explanations to, two classic ghost stories, the well known Bell Witch, and a lesser known poltergeist tale. My only wish would have been that the second tale had been handled in the same manner as the first."
3,Is it or isn't it....might be might not be.,"They meet after dark in an exclusive mens club. Amidst the swirling fog, they arrive wrapped tight in their cloaks, to tear apart the theories presented to them after much deliberation. They are the famous Harry Houdini, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle along with other prominent members of society who are interested in illusions and psychoanalysis. After being presented with strange stories, of what appears to be poltergeist or demonic activity, they present their analysis and conjectures.It is an interesting concept for a book and it was an out of the ordinary read but the analysis left me wanting more of a concrete explanation. I would give this one 3.5 stars. It was a quick read and the two main stories held my interest. I found myself trying to figure out how the manipulations were taking place, but like magic tricks in Vegas it was shear speculation. Kelsana 11/03/01"
4,All a question of taste,"I truly don't understand all the negative reviews of Other Worlds that I have read. I enjoyed the book very much, and was especially excited to read the cases of 'true' ghost stories that where presented. I thought the explinations that where offered by each participent to be true to what the actual person might have said or felt concerning the case. My only thought as to why others have given poor reviews is that they where expecting the same kind of offering the Ms. Micheals has given in the past. I commend her for not doing the same ole, same ole, and congradulate her for writing such a fine novel. I look forward to hearing more from this society of men."
1,The worst book she's ever written,"I've been a Barbara Michzaels fan for 30 years, since Ammie, Come Home, and her last two books, the Dancing Floor and this one were really quite poor. The Dancing Floor had a couple clever spots--this one sounded good but left me flat. It wasn't the hypothetical gathering--it was the lack of focus. Unfortunately in her alter ego of Elizabeth Peters, our author has fallen so in love with the character of Amelia Peabody that she just can't bear to write anything else. And Barbara/Elizabeth is not a young woman--I'm sure she's hurrying to get through the interminable Amelia saga before she dies. But the rest of her work has suffered greatly and her latest Barbara Michaels titles have just not held up the the standards she set in good stories like Here I Stay."
1,different isn't always good,"While I admire Barbara Michael's attempt at something different, this is not a good example of her work which is normally full of good humor even during the worst of situations. This book is unresolved and more of a scholarly tretis. But thanks for all your other books. They are deeply appreciated and enjoyed."
1,Michaels has disappointed this fan.,"Barbara Michaels is one of my favorite authors--I have read all her books, own most of them, and this is the first time I have been disappointed in her choice of stories. The 'mens' club' meeting of imaginary ghost busters is just plain boring. Most ghost story readers are already familiar with the tale of the Bell Witch, and by the time I got thru this and started on the various opinions, I had had enough. I must admit that I didn't get to the second story--I just gave up , and it is seldom that I don't finish a book. Come on, Barbara, go back to the romantic suspense your readers have come to expect and enjoy."
3,"This was different, but lets go back to normal",I would normally give her 4 1/2 to 5 stars but not this time. I liked the way she wrote her other novels. This just wasn't up to her regular standards. I t was good but just not her.
1,What happened?,"I'm a long-time fan of Barbara Michaels/Elizabeth Peters, and have gotten to where I'll buy her new books sight unseen, because they're always so fabulous. When I read this one, however, I was sadly disappointed. The case histories were interesting enough, but there was no conclusion, no drama, nothing. It just left you hanging in the air and feeling horribly dissatisfied. Usually when I finish one of her books I'm panting for the next one, yet satisfied with the conclusion. Not this time."
1,Barbara -- what happened???,"I have read every Barbara Michaels book ever written, including her incarnation as Elizabeth Peters. I have loved each and every one! This book doesn't even seem to be her writing style. I was actually bored, and read to the end only because I just kept hoping to see the old Barbara Michaels take over. I never did. I don't know what happened, but I want the old Barbara back!"
2,I can't believe she wrote this poorly,"This book was very disappointing, especially since I had waited so long for another Michaels' novel. I didn't mind the change in genres, but these stories didn't give me the chills the way all her others have. Not even one tiny goosebump. In addition, the second story was poorly edited, with the name of the little boy switching back and forth from Harry to Henry, sometimes even on the same page. I can't believe someone would recommend this book when such a distracting and confusing mistake pops up again and again. I couldn't bear to give it only one star, since I feel so loyal, but in my heart I know that I really think it deserved no star. Try one of her other books - you'll be much more pleased."
4,A comment,"Although published in the 1970s and long out-of-print this book is very enjoyable. It is a broad overview of the world of Gilbert & Sullivan, with emphasis shared on the works and lives of these remarkable men. Scores of photographs and sketches detail their theatrical era and the author avoids any kind of musical analysis. The book seems aimed at the layman (like myself) who wants all the major points of this Victorian phenomenon."
5,The Destroyer Keeps On Going,"Once again, The Destoyer series hits another home run!! After 123 books, you tend to think the series should be going down hill (like many other serialized books) but not The Destoyer. Remo and Chiun adventures keep me guessing and laughing. If you are a fan of the series, more specific, a fan of the Sapir/Murphy books, this one will not disappoint you. The action is exciting, the story keeps you engrossed and the wit in which the book is written, will put a smile on your face. Overall, this book was throughly enjoyable."
4,Really Good Read,"This is the first book I have read by this author. This book put me through a lot emotions. Happy, sadness, frustration. Through it all I really enjoyed it. Would definitely recommend."
3,The songs that are good are great but the ones that arent....,"I have listened to their new album Phantasmagore and it is a great improvement. The Key to Grammercy Park is one of the best songs i have ever heard, mansion world is great, and Tom Sawyer is really good. But the rest of the songs were very drab and number 4 made me want to kill myself but dont let my opionion stop you from buying it if its what you like."
3,"A different, yet mostly repetitive and boring album...","First of all, go to download ""Key to Grammercy Park"", that song is amazing. As for the others, I can't really say the same. Almost all of them are slow, boring, and sound the same. I thought the biggest problem was at times the singer, whos voice didn't seem to fit in well with the music. Oh and believe me, I laughed my head off when I heard ""She likes big words""... it's an extremely poppy retro song. Don't get me wrong though, some of the songs are enjoyable enough, and that's why it got 3 stars from me.I can definently say that this album is not for everbody, however if your into dark, gloomy, music and you still love retro then buy Commencement. For the rest of you, just go download the song, Key to Grammercy Park. Nuff said."
2,just a note,"this stuff is okay...nothing new at all, but all of you who like ""brand new love"" should realize it's a lou barlow tune...you can get different versions of it on sebadoh's ""freed weed"" (acoustic) and ""smash your head on the punk rock."" (electric w/full band) both versions make ""deadsy"" pale in comparison."
2,I lost $12,"I bought this cd because I thought it was something else, and gave it away two days later. You know those metal artists who write fun intros but should just keep their mouth shut before they ruin it with their ridiculous little melodies. That's kind of what this band is except their guitar work isn't all that great either. The melodies sound like they taught a child a key and let him wonder around a keyboard in it until he found something pretty. And they explore all of one guitar sound, within very strict, mainstream rooted confines. I hoped it might make some feel-good background noise to a conversation, but I couldn't take my mind off how bad it was. I went ahead and gave it two stars, because I know there is an audience who can at least groove to it better than me, but I still won't say it's good."
3,so so,"A lot of songs on here sound the same. I liked the fact that Jonathan Davis sang on ""Key to gramercy park"" but everything sounds the same in a way. My favorite songs were mansion world, commencment and she likes big words. This album gets rather boring because deadsy drags the song out longer than it should be. This album ""commencment is so-so. If you like korn you should pick this one up like I did. You may have to listen to it a few times to get used to the sound. Dont get me wrong. I like this album"
4,Great!,I like like this cd very much. Has a futuristic quality to it. All the tracks are good. Deadsy deserves more air play and credit. Highly recommendable to anyone's collection
4,there good,"well if you like electronic funk you will like this, its umm different... it diffintally has a depeche mode undertone feel to it, if you like this you will like fischerspooner which is a much better album than this."
1,Bleah,"I would rather be hit by a truck than listen to this cd again. I wish every time I listened to ""Too Dark Park"" a Deadsy album would explode into flames."
2,typical.....,"It was only a matter of time before someone took new-metal and mixed it with cheesy eightys rock. I work at a music store and the whole cd played right through and i must say i wasn't impressed. The album just has no flare to it and quite frankly i'd be embarassed to listen to it. I see no musical creativity at all, but rather a bunch of ""new-metal heads"" trying to make an 80 novelty album. ... sorry."
3,"Great gothic music, but sounds alike!","I like Elijah Allman's (Gregg Allman and Cher's son) gothic voice a lot! But the songs start to sound alike, and become uninspiring. The first track is the best, but the others begin to pale as the album progresses."
3,The Best Monotony I've Ever Heard,"I really like this band, and I really like their style, and I think they've done a great job of blending 80's synth with modern rock/metal, and I definitely commend them on it. And I am not disappointed with my purchase.However, I think there is a lot of potential for growth if they could just manage to find a different riff to jam on. Just about every single song uses the same Up down, up-not-quite-as-high, down-farther structure, and it can really make it sound monotonous unless you're really paying attention to the finer details of the instrumentation. That makes it accessible to a far lesser audience than it would be otherwise.Hopefully the turmoil over this release won't deter them from further efforts, as I would love to see where they go from here."
1,"The original artists, but not the original recordings.","This is the second time I've been tricked into buying a CD of ""The Original Artists"", only to find the recordings were new and not the original releases. I really wish there was something Amazon would post to alert buyers to these scams. Sure, caveat emptor, but when I buy the hit songs of 1961 (pick a date or musical group), I'd like to think it's the versions recorded in 1961, not something from a 30 year reunion tour... rant off."
1,customer beware,"In terms of content this Companion sits comfortably alongside the rest of the Oxford series for scholarship and the other qualities we customarily associate with this publishing house. However, that's where the story ends. In terms of the quality of publication you might expect to pick it up cheap on a news-stand or as a quick and inexpensive reprint in a remainder store. Oxford Companions usually come cloth-bound with dust-jacket, signature-sewn on acid-free paper and are a pleasure to handle. The current (US) 2006 reprint, ""printed digitally[and poorly at that]...in order to ensure its continuing availability"" (?), has a gloss,cardboard cover with the dust-jacket image printed on it, is perfect-bound (so the pages will eventually drop out), and is on mediocre, non-acid-free paper. I have never seen a poorer quality product from Oxford at this end of the scale: I believe it is totally unacceptable. And the 1st. ed. is apparently still available. Shame on Oxford UP Inc., New York."
4,fireplace dvd,"this was my 1st, and it definitely created a nice ambience during a recent party I had. Some people commented that the quality was excellent and almost felt warmer"
1,Kent,"Company's website is displayed on screen near the end of the loop, thereby ruining what otherwise is a lovely fire. Dumb."
2,Nice DVD but ruined by advertising...,"The company website information shows up about 45 minutes in and stays on the screen for about two minutes before starting the loop over again.In my opinion, it is completely unacceptable that the makers advertise their company website on the DVD. Completely UNACCEPTABLE. It ruins the experience. Shame on the makers of this DVD. I do not recommend this DVD and I suggest you continue looking for another Fireplace DVD....."
5,Worth the purchase if you have a Blu-ray player!,"For $8.99 you can't really beat this. I originally had just a DVD version, but once I had a Blu-ray player I upgraded my fireplace ambiance. I love to curl up to a book so it's easily a worth while purchase for me since I live in an apartment with no fireplace.No reason not to try it, you'll be impressed."
5,Watching the fire on Blu-ray is even better,"I already owned the fireplace on standard DVD. However, when I finally got a Blu-ray player, I bought the fireplace on Blu-ray disc. All I can say is WOW what a difference. The fire is stunning and sound crystal clear. If you are wondering if the upgrade is worth it, I assure you it is. Watching the fire is very relaxing and enjoyable. It's the best thing TV most nights, and I'm not kidding about that."
4,Good basic firewire kit: Card + cable + software,"This is a good, basic, firewire kit. Not the latest or best firewire card on the block, but perfectly good. Here are the exact contents of this particular kit:1) 3+1 firewire PCI firewire card, using the VIA VT6306 chipset. This is an older firewire chipset, but a perfectly adequate one. This chipset is widely used, which has the advantage of good support--the drivers for this card are built into Windows XP and updated versions of older Windows operating systems, and the card should be automatically recognized and installed in these operating systems without need for external drivers.2) Cyberlink PowerProducer 2 VE software, on CD3) One 6-to-4 pin firewire cable4) Brief ""user manual"".Nothing super fancy, but a perfectly decent kit if you can get it at a modest price."
1,Unable to capture!,"This card installed properly and is recognized as a standard OHCI card by Windows XP Home SP2. My camcorder is also recognized by Windows in the control panel. I can control my JVC miniDV camcorder with it. FFwd, Rev, Play, Pause, Stop works. But I am unable to view or to capture video with it. I am using a Dell Dimension 3000 Celeron D 2.66GHz. I tried two different firewire cables, tried the card in two different PCI slots, tried all ports on the card one by one. Still no video in Windows Movie Maker or Nero7. Boot, re-boot, cycle power...The same camcorder works fine using same cable on a Compaq 5700T running Windows 98SE (PIII/500MHz)! Has built-in Firewire ports.I will spend more on a Firewire card next time."
5,Inexpensive and works great,"I was able to get this card with a [...] rebate (received the check in just a couple of weeks!) so it was quite cheap for me. I installed the firewire card & my OS (Windows XP x64) detected it. The default 64 bit drivers that Windows installed work fine. I'm using it to capture from my camcorder using WinDV. Great product, Great price, what more can you ask for?"
2,Hated it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have 2 computers and I tried this in both of them and it didn't work in either. My first computer crashed after I tried to use this port and on the second one it just didn't work. Bad investment
5,Good deal for the price,"A good card for the price.Newer PC's (if you build your own) seem to all have this port already built in to the motherboard.But not everyone gives you the wire to go from the motherboard to the backplane.These cards were new-in-box, cellophane wrapped, from amazon for only $3.99 (during a June 2006 sale)Easiest way I have found to add firewire to my older systems.Requires only an EMPTY PCI slot."
3,Entertaining,"I listened to the unabrigdged version on CD. I find the story entertaining, but like another reviewer, could do without the tedious descriptions of the clothing and eating habits of the characters. The reader on the CD did a fabulous job pronouncing the wine-names (all very pretentious and expensive brands from the Bordeaux region in France).There are also the stereotypical, midwest or texan 6 foot plus, meat-eating good guys and the brown, curly haired, small bad guys, liberals and peace-lovers. The author lets his simplistic right-wing attitude show too much. The hero's girlfriend says roast beef sandwich is bad for him and then serves veal. If the security advisor to the president constantly eats like this (and drinks) he can't be much help.The story seems good to me, I was kept guessing what that ultra-smart, ruthless but somehow likeable spy would do next."
2,Precise telling,"There's a beautifully detailed journey, across Scotland and Ireland, before the book settles down into a smaller story of Adnam's personal quest for some kind of redemption. I find Robinson's telling fast, at times thrilling, but in the end cold and too technical."
2,"Good beginning, terrible end...","I loved Robinson's two previous books, and liked that one... until page 200. Then the story grinds to a halt and proceeds at snail's pace to a very disappointing end. I read the second half of the book by skipping 9 pages out of 10 and didn't miss anything important. There are already too many bestselling authors (Cornwell, Clancy, Follet to cite a few) that are currently writing books way below the standards of their beginnings... I just hope that Robinson didn't join the lot. I guess I also just got sick of buckshot in Admiral Morgan's coffee and of his racist habit of calling muslims ""towelheads""... also Robinson seems to have a love for series (sinking 11 Kilos in the previous opus and shooting three airliners in this one) that doesn't help with the predictability of his plots. A good editor could have (should have) taken care of that."
1,Nothing but political BS,"I am so sick of the political undercurrents in Patrick Robinson's books that I have stopped reading them. Though the stories are good, Robinson diminishes them by labeling and pigeonholing and demeaning anybody he does not agree with politically - especially Democrats. I stopped reading Scimiter SL-2 because I got so sick of it. I'm sure HarperCollins would sell more books if they could get him to stop the bashing."
4,Great tie in with his 2 other books......,"I enjoyed the reappearance of the cast from the past 2 books. Yes, the are some real nasties in this book & not all of them on the ""other side"" the bigot Adm. Morgan, a crazy U.S. president, but after what we presently are going through are their actions so far fetched? Ben Adnam's saga is sad, but at the same time I never got the impression he thought his life would be any other way, Patriot~Zealot~Villian? There is alot of comment on the over detailing his journey, the food he ate, etc: I viewed it as the savorying of what he was seeing as the ""Enjoyment of the Little things, tomorrow we may die"" A very typical warrior trait. I gulped this book down in a couple of days, found it a solid adventure, very fast read! Very good 3rd. book of this series, I hope there will be more."
1,H.M.S. Unssen,"I managed to complete Nimitz Class, but not Unseen. I just can't do it. Robinson's character development/dialogue is poor and ruins his plots which have the potential of being great adventure stories. Admiral Morgan, his secretary and the he-man president are terrible. I'm listening to the book on tape and after only the 3rd tape I really have to quit. Maybe Robinson should collaborate with another writer; he could supply the plot and the other writer could do the actual writing."
1,"Poor, boring and predictable",I found this to be the worst of Robinson's three novels. His hero is not a very appealing individual - I found myself rooting for the villaim - a very evil person. The ending is quite illogical - given what went before. Save your money and wait for Clancy's next book.
3,"Good, but no Clancy or Forsyth","This is the first Patrick Robinson I have read and may be the last. While he does spin a reasonable techno-thriller, the story jumps often and leaves many unfinished threads. His story is not smooth and his research appears to be limited. As a former submarine officer, I can enjoy a far fatched plot, but don't really want to read a poorly developed or reached novel. Clancy still does it better than anyone. Forsyth's ""Fist of God"" is a well researched also."
2,Boring compared to Kilo Class,H.M.S. Unseen was so boring in comparison to Kilo Class that I could have sworn they were written by different authors. I also don't think the plot line or main character were plausible. I would read Patrick Robinson again but would hope for something better than this.
1,Cardboard characters,"Kilo was bad, this is worse. Characters have the depth of cardboard and sooo predictable. Conservatives good; liberals bad. Arabs are ""ragheads""; ta da ta da ta da. One star is too much."
2,Disappointing book!,"This is a truly dissapointing book!The main technical idea(fitting a sam launcher on the back of a submarine) is quite interesting,but the author is a very poor writer when it comes to describe people.This is what in my opinion makes Tom Clancy a far superior techno-triller writer.Patrick Robinson has a very mono-dimensional view of the world full of racism toward not-english-speaking countries and Arabs in particular.Do not buy this book!"
4,"Kept to my seat up to the end, which was bad","First book I took from Patrick Robinson. I'm coming from Tom Clancy's arena and my thoughts are somewhat mixed for this book. The story was nice, the details were great, and I was kept to my seat until I finished it. I would say my deception goes with the terrible ending, which starts slow then goes terribly fast and leave you with an ""Huh?"".Overall, not bad, good story."
5,Brillant,I Really Like this book and the part of the terrorist I think that it was good portrail of the character. Same with the portrail of Admiral Arnold Morgan.
1,Pathetic dialog,"After Kilo and Nimitz, I was also disappointed with Unseen. The characters are cartoonish. Admiral Morgan is a bore. I am dropping out at page 166 while he is on his grand tour of the UK."
2,Bogged-down techno-filler,"If Mr. Robinson is going to fill a book with dialogue, he really should learn how to write it. I read the last 300 pages of this yawner in one sitting -- by skipping over or glancing through vast sections looking for some excitement. The comparison to Tom Clancy is quite a mystery. I'd like my money back, please."
2,Good Story... But...,"HMS Unseen is a relatively interesting read, but the plot plods along in places. I was also surprised by the racist and homophobic comments that peppered the book (this is my first Patrick Robinson book). I still wanted to finish the book, but I wouldn't put Robinsin in a class with Tom Clancy."
3,Not as good as the first three,"I loved Nimitz Class and Kilo Class, but find that HMS Unseen is only about average. As others have pointed out, there is a great deal of detail that isn't really pertinent to the story. One suspects that Robinson was hungry during the entire time he was writing this novel. Additionally, the storyline is not as believable as the plots from the earlier novels."
1,"Lousy ending, bad psychology, poor premises","Fine example of how popular authors are pushed by publishers to do novels too fast, with poor results.This story expects you to believe that a consumate professional military man/terrorist, who has never made a mistake in his career, allows sentimental attachment to a lost love to fuzz his intellect, producing simple behavior/mistakes which doom him.It expects you to believe that the US Navy is constrained by budget from pursuing conclusions reached by the National Security Advisor, a retired admiral, thereby dooming a more people in a repeated terrorist action.It expects you to believe that the news media will ignore an obvious lead from a reliable witness in the last incident, even when sensational, anti-military and anti-gov. (Actually, they did just this in the Fl800 story, for about 100 witnesses.)The author thinks we are all morons."
2,H.M.S. Unseen,"Well, I finally did get through the book. This is definitely the worst one of the three. For anyone to compare Mr. Robinson to Mr. Clancy tells me one thing. They don't know Clancy!"
4,A dynamite conclusion to the life of Ben Adnam,"As I've said before, Robinson is my favorite fiction author. I have my copy of HMS Unseen signed by him when he came to the local Borders on tour. He also read a section of it.This is one of the best endings I could come up with for Ben Adnam. The trek he took through the desert to Iraq was beautifully portrayed by Robinson, and his plan is down to earth enough to be real, but outlandish enough to be entertaining.Once again, Robinson plays to his strengths - his characters. Arnold Morgan continues to be my personal favorite character, a very animated, loud man who knows what he wants and how to get it. It's truly satisfying when the Unseen is sunk, and you get a real shock after the Starstriker is shot down.Robinson has proved again and again that he's quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with in the techno-thriller field. This series of books has been so enjoyable to me I don't know what I'll do when he concludes it.Probably wait for his next one."
1,Disappointing,"As a child I remember sitting on the living room floor listening to this album over and over. I loved it. I recently downloaded the album for my daughter, only to discover that four of the best tracks have been removed, and others re-recorded. The LP from 1980 included ""I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy"", ""Liberty Tree"", "" This Land is Your Land"", and ""The Battle of New Orleans"". It's baffling that these great songs have been dropped. If your kids aren't listening to the original LP version, they are missing out. What a disappointing experience from a trusted brand."
2,Dissapointing,"The CD isn't the same album that I grew up with in the 80's. Fantastic songs like, ""I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy"", ""Liberty Tree"", "" This Land is Your Land"", and ""The Battle of New Orleans"" have all been omitted. Which is a shame since they are some of the best ones in the bunch! My husband and I both remember enjoying the tape on family road trips as children. (separate family road trips of course!) Disappointed in Disney for not including all of the songs from the original release. I didn't see the reason for some of the songs to be re-recorded either. Don't get me wrong, the music is still up to Disney quality standards...only reason I gave it a 2 star. Still a great CD, but if you are expecting what children of the 80's grew up with, be forewarned that it's not that album. I've searched and haven't found it out there."
5,A good AFR sensor,quick ship and good quality. It solved the CHECK ENGIN LIGHT ON problem of my 99 Toyota Camry.
4,Good look and fit,The visors seem to fit well and were easy to install and look great only negative is a slight whistle at highway sleeds now but definitely liveable and hardly noticeable over the radio
5,Cool product,You can not go wrong with this for your 5th Gen Exp. Easy to install. Be sure to fit test before permanent application. Looks superb.
1,Too complex for students first learning calculus,I am using this book in a 2 semester Calculus coarse and this books makes it A LOT harder then it should be. This book tends to over complicate simple concepts. I get the impression that the authors are trying to impress their fellow mathematicians rather than trying to teach Calculus to the student.
1,tries to keep everything a secret from you,"At my school, this book was used for the general calculus class, and I hated it. If you've never seen a proof before, this book is confusing. The examples are unclear and not explained. It just sort of does something and doesn't explain what it did or why, almost as if it's trying to keep everything a secret from you. I think professors and higher-level students like this book, but it's not very friendly to beginner calculus students."
2,Way too theoretical,"I used this book for undergraduate Calculus I and II. I had never taken calculus before and if it weren't for my wonderful professor, I would have hated and failed calculus. This book was definately not geared toward beginning calculus students-its way too theoretical. Instead of working out examples, they spend most of their time proving theorums. When you're just trying to understand the basics of calculus, how to differentiate, integrate and determine whether or not a series converges, you don't care about the proof, you really don't! I think this book would be better for an advanced calculus course where the students already understand the basics and want more theory. This book was just way to abstract for me. It didn't help to understand the material so if you don't have a good professor and you've never taken calculus, this book is not going to be your cup of tea."
2,Descriptive rather than instructive,"This book appears to offer guidance and advice about how to develop political skill for use in the workplace. Unfortunately, it spends the bulk of its time convincing us how and why political skill is important.If what you're looking for is a good discussion on why you might look harder at developing political skill, this book will convince you to do just that. If you're looking for a book about how to develop or enhance that skill, look for another book."
3,One of the best AD&D adventures of all time? Hmmmm...,"This adventure is one of those early modules that seemed to spark the imagination of a lot of gamers way back when. But now, looking at it again, this is a little too light to be a true classic. It seems more like the intoduction to a good adventure series than a stand-alone adventure. With some work, it fits in well as a side adventure or the beginning of a campaign. Also, I'm somewhat mystified that this thing got enough votes to make it one of the Best Adventures of All Time. Keep on the Borderlands; OK, maybe because it broke new ground. Against the Giants; well, it's obvious. But this too? Really?"
1,The Worst movie ever,"If you like a shaky camera view (borderline ""car sick"" feeling) and a hyperventilating, screaming woman for nearly 1.5 hours, this movie's for you. It's a horror film all right - ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE."
3,remake,i give this 3 stars simply because this is a remake of a spanish horrormovie called REC. hollywood is obviously running out of ideas. first they copy almost every succesful asian horror movie...now they reach even further out. people should watch REC. first...because I AM a horror buff but REC.had me jumping all over the place...
1,Piece of garbage,"Just like Cloverfield. A very chaotic mess. The camera is never still long enough to tell that is going on. Also the lighting is bad. I don't know came up with the idea of having the ""home movie"" style of film making. but they need to stop doing it. Save that style for the home video. I was VERY disapponted."
4,Effective Cinema Verite Horror,"Great flick. The Cinema Verite style works in this movie and draws you in. There's a few minutes build up to kind of introduce the characters and set everything up, and then the pace is pretty relentless for the rest of the movie. The effects come through well despite being shot on video with fairly dark scenes. One is left to wonder which is more chilling, running from flesh eating zombie freaks or being penned up and left to die by a government attempting containment.This is based on the Spanish film [*REC], which is as good or better, so you may want to check that out as well."
3,Predictable ending - spoiler warning,"Some scenes were nail biting and it had potential, if only the writers hadn't succumbed to the cookie cutter type ending, ala ""Night of the Living Dead"". All the actors die. Duh. How about something a bit more creative that not only lends itself to a sequel but makes you anxious to see one? I know, I know, there IS a ""Quarantine 2"". But after catching the ending of this one, I don't think I care to spend the time on it."
3,"Not great, but not a waste.","Filmed like the ""Blair Witch Project"", this movie did keep my interest. It had a little gore which I like in horror films. All in all, I'd give it 3/5. I'd only watch it once."
2,Not worth a watch...if,"I saw this in the movies and a lot of the people in the audience were laughing at the parts that should have been scarey. I saw REC, not the dubbed version, and its for some reason far better."
5,Great! IN Theaters & at Home,The first time I saw this movie was at the premiere with a bunch of friends. Even with a crowd of joking teenagers it was very scary. I bought it and watched it many times. I haven't yet seen [rec] so I wouldn't know how to compare them. But by far one of my favorite horror movies and a must buy.
3,NICE ACTING ESPECIALLY,A documentary style movie that does a pretty job with delivery. Expect low special effects but the story and especially the emotional fear of the actors and actresses is exceptionally well done. WHEN WATCHED: September 2010; MY GRADE: B minus to B.
2,horrible camera work,the first 30 min are dull theres really bad camera work in the movie ur basically watching darkness the whole movie also
1,RENT REC NOT QUEERINTEEN,so why did they redo REC and not bring the killer euro hit to american shores? cuz movies with subtitles dont do well here. do yourself a favor and avoid this mess and go to amazon uk to pick up rec. they got a great version.
1,Quaran...zzzzzzzzz,"I rented this movie because i'm a huge horror fan...plus, i like Jennifer Carpenter...but to be honest, the movie just (literally) put me to sleep. That's all I have to say. I wouldn't write it off though...watch it for yourself, to each his own."
1,I think it was good...,"This movie tries to make it scary by having a shaky camera on the actors/actresses. With the camera jumping from one person to another, I was not scared, but more annoyed that I could not see what was going on. The light on the camera was annoying as well. Sometimes you could see a lot of the surroundings and at other times it was a 2-3 inch circle of light, but when the infra red lens comes on, it was much bigger. At times it was like watching the movie with your eyes closed. If you liked Blair Witch, then this movies will be right up your alley. Rent this movies first or borrow it from a friend."
1,Just another bad remake.,"This is just one more bad remake showing the lack of ideas in the US movies of nowadays. Making thumping noises and moving the camera frantically do not makes the remakes any better; on the contrary, it only makes them so so boring and plain!! As for all other remakes, and even more for this one, I do recommend to stick to the original, in this case, the fabulous Spanish movie ""Rec"", of which the original filmmakers are already preparing a sequel. Don't miss ""Rec"", just forget about ""Quarantine""."
2,REC REC REC!!!!,"Un burdo plagio de REC, ni comparación a esa película, esta...da risa...estos gringos siempre creen que pueden mejorar las versiones originales y NUNCA lo hacen!!!...mala, muy mala, no pierdan su tiempo viéndola!!"
3,Effective chiller,"No spoilers here. I can't remember when I first heard about this but I got to see it at the cinema and I have to admit that I was genuinely surprised. Being shown from a first-party POV adds to our unwilling involvement. It's tense and claustrophobic and, needless to say, dimly lit. No-one knows what's going on here. We're as lost as the participants in this rapidly-unfolding horror show. And, yes, it does get worse.Really not bad at all but the downside is that it's a remake of a highly interesting Spanish flick called [Rec]. I saw this after watching Quarantine and I have the sinking feeling that had I not, instead of watching what played like Quarantine all over again it might have played like the attention-grabber that it really is.The reality is that Quarantine is a slavish, scene-for-scene copy. Hardly one for the books but worth a look nonetheless."
2,Lacking,"This movie hits a few chords dead on.. the brutality is convincing and the story is generally interesting but Quarantine is lacking in what counts -- memorable/interesting characters. The movie wastes the first 30 minutes on the virtues of a fire station pole and by the time we get to the action - we don't care who lives or dies.I could have saved this movie --The movie should have been 2 hours; the first hour being filmed 'traditionally at the actual 'lockdown' Quarantine area so we could get to KNOW the people involved, instead of them being thrown at us at a fever pitch so in turn we feel NO attachment to them.. the second hour should have been filmed with the shaky cam as they ran for their lives.. and in general even though I like Dexters very own Jen Carpenter, the whole cast needs to take it down a notch, the whole movie is over acted and a real mess of shrieks and ""OH MY GODS!"""
1,Dreadful!,"I almost turned it off during the first ten minutes. That ditzy, hyper reporter cavorting with the firemen was absurd and lasted for what seemed like forever. So much wrong with this movie...shaky cam, too dark, bad acting, silly plot. I did manage to get halfway through it and then went to fold laundry which was more enjoyable."
2,What's The Point?,"European, Asian, and Australian films have really made an impact on me over the last few months. After seeing ""I Stand Alone"", ""Irreversible"", ""Eden Lake"" (and several other Dimension Extreme titles), and of course ""Rec"" -I truly have become jaded towards American horror. ""Quarantine"" is exemplary. This film tries to virtually copy ""Rec"" scene for scene with lower grade scares and FX. Unless your're a completist just skip it and watch ""Rec"". Even those who hate subtitles will be glad they did. What's with this trend anyway? Even Michael Haneke remade ""Funny Games"", his own film, for crissakes. This unneeded remake cycle seemed to occur about the time Gus Van Sant made his biggest mistake in tackling ""Psycho"" which I think everyone agrees was a waste of celluloid. As much as films cost to make nowadays one would think there would be better things to ""Rec""."
2,Headache!,"I got terrible serious headache watching this movie from the beginning till the end. The movie scenes were ""viewed"" from the cameraman (the actor holding the camera), and so the entire movie was freaking shaking left right up and down. It's a terrible tactic using the camera the actor is holding to cature the entire movie scenes and shown them to the viewers. The scenes were moving and shaing all over the place and I ended up don't really know what the freak this movie is all about, except the movie was shaking like hell..At one point I was almost gonna turn-off the DVD. 2 stars for me, for the effort in producing the movie."
3,No Cloverfield.,"I am guessing this was Sony's attempt to copy the profits of Paramounts Cloverfield. To put it short, they failed. Now, its not a completely horrible movie its just not good. You never find out whats going on or why, just people running and screaming.Story 1/5Camera Effects 1/5Gore 3/5Entertainment 3/5Total: 3 Stars"
3,Blair Witch Project meets Night of the Living Dead,"Hey, as we slip towards socialism, you could do worse than renting this pseudo/thriller with the B cast. OK, so I'm too tough, I know. But look, dude, after the 8th time someone orders the camera guy to stop filming...and, duh, of course..they, you know..keep on filming? And the old dude...same creepy old dude from Eyes Wide Shut. I dunno..I suppose I got some scares early on..but it just dragged on and was ultimately somewhat predictable. Look, the movie is sick and you don't need it. But still, for cheap thrills, you can do much worse."
2,Another Blair Witch Copy,"I wanted this film to be good and I was willing to give the story a chance. The camera footage (Cloverfield copy) just made me sick, and I had to turn it off. I wished they just filmed it normally and let the story speak for itself, now I can't even finish the story. I'll have to got to movie [...] to find out what happens."
3,It's loud,If your surround speakers are close to you (mine are on either side of the sofa) all you will hear are annoying helicopter and ambulance sounds that drown out the dialog!And why did they ruin the ending with the trailer!!!???
4,Yes!,"Best zombie movie ever. None of that tired formula we see in most every other one. And for those who may complain about origins and causes, everything is explained if you're paying attention."
1,"Yes, this movie SHOULD BE QUARANTINED","It's a rip-off of ""28 days later"" and ""Cloverfield"". If you've seen these movies, you won't find anything new in Quarantine.Oh, there's a difference. The acting is not as good as that of those two. There's a lot of killing but there's no suspense or horror."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"I refuse to watch this, the original is really good enough and there is no reason to give a damn about this. Fortunally, I'm not the only one, I hope this pale copy disapear in limbo... the lack of creative ideas in hollywood and the lazy habit not to even try to watch a movie wich is not spoke in english must be the only reasons for this total waste of time and money...GO WATCH THE ORIGINAL AND SUPPORT THE REAL CREATORS OF THIS GENUINE GREAT NEW HORROR MOVIE."
1,SLEEPY-BORING,"This was a sleeper of a movie... This movie is a remake of many different movies, Coverfield, Resident Evil, so forth. If the writers and directors had done a better job it could have been a better movie. DONT waste your money, I rented it, and it still was a waste of money."
1,The WORST GARBAGE Filmed lately . . .,"Thought this would be good; having the sister from Dexter in it.Another RABIES creating ZOMBIES movie. The worst one yet. Filming looked like it was done by a 3 year old with their first ""Toddler Video camera"". Worse than Blair witch.They may actually be the same people, and have the same writers and crew.JUST AWFUL!!!!"
2,"Kinda sucked, some parts were okay","This movie just wasn't realistic enough. First, people wouldn't be so stupid (I hope) as to let a second or third pale skinned-saliva coming out the mouth person have the chance to rip your throat out. Plus, a police officer is not going to shoot at any person that appears in a window. Also, they just bit people, never did EAT them-movie review said they turned cannibalistic.To be fair: I thought the main character did really good with looking scared as hell, and blind in the dark. OH-THE PREVIEWS R-U-I-N-E-D THE VERY ENDING! THAT SUCKED, CAUSE I KNEW WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN! That ending would have been great, had I not known!"
3,Let's Forget the Hand Held Camera!!!!,"Let's forget the hand held first person camera perspective, Okay? It's been done before. Remember Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield? It's no longer new or inovative. Can't we make a scary movie anymore without using a shaky camera technique that doesn't scare us but tends to make us dizzy and nauseated. Also, too much of the movie takes place in the dark."
1,What a disappointment.,Story line had the chance to make a great thriller. But in the end it could not be disputed that everyone deserved to die due to their own stupidity and ignorance. That's an hour and a half of my life I will never get back.
1,This movie should be quarantined,"Without a doubt the worst movie I have seen in the last year. Bad acting, stolen plot lines, terrible pacing - complete junk."
1,Watch the original Spanish movie [*REC],"'Quarantine' is a complete rip-off of a highly original and extremely intense Spanish film named '[*REC]'. The characters in '[*REC]' are not annoying, the gore reigns supreme, and the ending MAKES SENSE (no need to tone it down for the audience... <rolls eyes>).And while you're at it, be sure to watch 'Let The Right One In' (the original of 'Let Me In'), the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', don't even bother with the ""remake"" of 'Friday The 13th', PLEASE oh PLEASE don't remake 'Oldboy' with Will Smith as the main character, and (unfortunately) on and on...Personally, I hate the latest craze of ripping off original movies just to make a buck."
1,Mindless Junk,I think parts of my brain melted when my wife forced me to watch this waste of film stock.
1,Boring!,"I really expected much more from this movie than I got. It bored me so that I turned it off a little more than half way through it. I threw it in my pile of ""I'll never watch again"" movies. It was too dark to see what was going on most of the time. Nothing about this film interested me. The previews really talked this one up to be something extraordinary, but it fell way short of that. I hated it!"
3,Not so bad,"This movie have 2 names REC and Quarantine, 3 stars because director is from Spain , if is American my opinion down to 2 stars.Is just another movie about infected people eating the others, no big deal."
3,Quarantine,"""Quarantine"" was slightly better than ""Rec"" in my opinion, better made, better acting, and more smooth. The only part that could have been better was the ending. Otherwise this one rocks, it improved on ""Rec""."
2,It's Unintentional Humor is it's Only Redeeming Value,"Ok, I went into this movie with LOW expectations. I had heard mixed reviews from friends and IMDb and so I decided to give it a shot. Am I glad? Well, I got a couple of great laughs out of it, so yeah. Quarantine is one of those films that has SO much going for it that you almost want to cry when the entire thing falls to pieces. The entire sequence at the beginning with the firemen was great! Clever scripting, realistic acting, awesome characterization... As soon as the crisis occurs, the film is dead. I can't even see how this film could be put in the same league as Cloverfield... I haven't been this disappointed in a horror film since ""The Grudge 2."""
4,Wrong Genre,"Quarantine, if anything, suffers from the ill fate of building excellent suspension, but never capitalized on the tension to make produce horror. Itsets up a brilliant atmosphere, great progression throughout, and has clever ideas, turns to be more thriller, than scarey.Thrillers, for me, is when you set-up the audience as if you would scare them, but instead you keep them tense throughout. This is Quaratine.Even though I consider it to be a thriller, it still keeps true with many aspects of modern horror. One being plenty of blood and gore. The R rating is not an overstatment at all to Quarantine. With the ocassional wonky acting done by a crew of rather unknown actors, horror fans will curb their appetite with Quarantine, but there is no feast here."
3,Decent Horror Marred by Shakey-Cam,"I wish people in Hollywood would stop making Shakey-Cam movies. Its really not that clever. This would have been a pretty good horror movie if not for the choice to film it using technology from 1950's.Quarantine is a zombie film; fast zombies, not slow ones. A reporter and her cameraman get trapped in an apartment filled with people infected with some zombie virus. Pretty standard stuff here, the problem is that Shakey-Cam is used here to be trendy. ""Help, I'm being attacked by a zombie"" an actress will scream. The cameraman puts down the camcorder and *BAM*, the action stops. STOPS!Another decent horror film ruined by Shakey-Cam."
2,Another movie ruined by unsteady handicam.,"I don't think I have ever seen a movie using the unsteady handicam method that I truly enjoyed. It just gives me nausea and motion sickness at best, especially on a 133"" projection screen! This movie would've been much more enjoyable without it. Come on Reality TV, true TV cameramen have a steadier hand than that, plus don't professional cameras have shake reduction technology? End of rant."
3,"Open Water meets Resident Evil, but not in a Good Way","I lovedOpen Water (Widescreen Edition), the feel of the first person camera view was very, very realistic and scary. I also lovedResident Evil 1-3the concept of being trapped uninfected with others with a deadly infection is also very scary, with the added great effects and eye candy heroine. Quarantine, is a combination of those two movies to me without much of the good parts.Here's the deal, if you liked Cloverfield, you might like this which is a small step down. If you didn't love Cloverfield, you might want to pass.2 1/2 *"
3,Great Acting But Too Long,"They could have knocked off 20 minutes off this film and it would have been better. We had to watch every person go down one at a time. But the acting was superb. Very believable. Then there are a few actual ""shock"" scenes that get you, but most is predictable. This film is worth watching once."
2,ALL HYPE,"This is over hyped rubbish with one of those stupid low budget hand held cameras. Here is a spoiler for you. That picture on the cover and that lone movie clip they show you is the last scene in the movie. It was just starting to pick up and it is over. If you enjoyed the suspense aspect of the movie and the idea of an unknown horror, but failed to loved the bad documentary style, I might suggest ""The Possession of David Reilly."""
4,"Good, but a shot-by-shot remake of the Spanish [REC]","A film team led by reporter Angela Vidale [Jennifer Carpenter] follows a fire crew for the night as part of a documentary for a light news show. When they get a call out, it's not to a fire, but a woman in distress. So begins a night of terror; the woman, and many other residents of the apartment building are infected with a virus that acts like rabies, but develops much faster. The infected foam at the mouth and are incredibly aggressive. As the night progresses, and the infection explodes, the film team must fight off the infected monsters to survive. What makes Quarantine interesting is that it is shot entirely from the viewpoint of the cameraman, Scott [Steve Harris]. It would be quite inventive if it were not a shot-for-shot remake of the Spanish film [REC].Still, well worth seeing, but I'd advise seeing [REC] first."

1,Could have been a Good Movie - I'm still shaking as I write this,"This story actually could have been a winner, in as much this premise would have allowed. I bought this DVD with hopes of little idea of what it was really about. The premise starts off a little mundane but all of which gave me hints as to what would become of it.As the story enveloped into it's true storyline, it became interesting and had me anxious to see what would be next.What ruined it? The shake-a-thon camera work. I'm thoroughly convinced that directors which resort to this type of ""effect"" do so at the lack of ingenuity, a budget or simple experience. Regardless of which, this effect ruined the entire film. I simply had to fast forward through this irritating effect just to try and get to the end. It would never have made a four star movie, but it could have had a three star review."
4,A small film but good horror,"The Bottom Line:A faithful remake of the Spanish [REC] that makes wise choices about what scenes to add (it's about 13 minutes longer than the original), boasts a better title, and generates a good level of tension, Quarantine will not be thought of much in 5 years but if you want a quick and horrific little film you could do a lot worse.3/4"
1,Simply AWFUL,"Too bad we cant give negative stars.This was simply a horrible film.....very predictable....only about 1hr 20min, but it seemed like a 5 hour movie it was so bad.I wish I could pick one good thing I liked.....just one...But I can't..It is a 100% waste of 1hr and 20min of your life...save yourself the time and do something else with that 1hr 20minGo feed a stray dog or cat...your time wil be better spent then wasting it on this movie.I realize everybody is entitled to their own opinions and everybody has different tastes when it comes to movies, but I cant believe this film got a single positive review, let alone some of the ones I see with 4 or 5 stars calling this a masterpiece or one of the scariest movies ever......Folks, Stick with the negative reviews or feel free to watch it and form your own conclusion...But, this was literally one of the worst films I have ever seen."
3,Storyline sounds familiar...,"Is it just me or does this book's plot got a strong resemblance to the bestseller book ""The Old-Girl Network"" by Catherine Alliot? Even the characters are extremely similar: unsuspecting helpful gall helps a looney jilted boyfriend find his girlfriend who's being hidden by her dad. Strange coincidence?"
5,Society Sisters Get in Mischief!,This book was a fun and enjoyable read! Clemmie was a character to which one can relate. She and Holly were a good mischievious team! I have added her books Playing James and Party Girl to my Wish List and I am looking forward to reading them!
2,Save your money,"I stopped reading halfway through, it was boring and anti-climatic. Mason's first book, 'Playing James', was excellent--witty, intersting, and fun. Save your money on this book."
2,Not very good.,"I got about 1/2 way through the book then decided to stop reading it. The first haf was good then I didn't see why it needed to go on. Just bored me. It didn't grab my attention like some chick lit mysteries have. I got it for $1 at a used book store, so I didn't waste much."
4,Husband Likes It,"This tool does its job well without leaving little hairs all over the food. Good tool, has been used for over a year now and is still great."
3,3.5 Nice Read,"This was a pretty good book. Had humor and a good story like the last one I read. My only complaint is that I wish authors would print in large print when a book is part of a series, and which book each one is. I read the last first, now I am back tracking."
3,small business book - 3 stars,"Covers what starting points a small business minded person might need. However, there are far more books you can find which are 20 times better!"
4,Another easy addition the series,"This is another dummies addition that reads much like the others, easily. It really strives to get beginners to understand that starting a small business is serious business, and that its risky. It understands and expresses that small business just isn't the best move for everyone. The book does give many resources and chapters that are devoted to help keeping a small business afloat, managing employees and the all important legalities. I purchased this book in accompaniment with The Magic Touch: How to make $100,000 per year as a massage Therapist by Meagan R. Holub. The Magic Touch really exceeds many other texts in that it provides surefire applications for a service business to use so that it can have optimum chances of real success. Together these books make a great team."
3,Nice How-To,"Got this for my hubs, who is interested in starting his own business - very nicely laid out, easy to read, easy to follow - I couldn't tell you applicable the advice is since I haven't started my own business yet, but this one follows like all the other Dummy books - easy to understand."
3,Pretty weak.,"This books reads more like an encyclepedia than an acutal guide for small business. Very little in here for someone who is running a business. Most of the advice is is in the form of rudimentry questions like ""are you sure you are ready for business."""
4,"A great book for those thinking about starting a business, but falls short on key details","While I appreciate the ""for Dummies"" series -- I own several on various topics -- I often feel like the series really is for beginners (I won't use the word ""dummies""). I bought this book since I am in the process of starting up a small business. And while there are some important points and tips made, and the writing is very accessible, I found the book lacking in some really crucial details of small business ownership. For example, if you want detailed advice on taxes, payroll, and accounting, I would recommend other books. If you really just want to get an idea of what it takes to get a business up and going, a quick manual of sorts, than this book is what you need."
4,The basics for the beginner!,"Small Business for Dummies is right on par with the rest of the Dummy series, the basics with professional and well established tips and tricks thrown into the mix.Whether you are establishing your first ever LLC or looking at acquisitioning an already established company, this will provide you with some valuable information. However by no means is this the say all, end all to small business, it's just the basics.One thing that I was glad to see was the sections (all though small) about tapping in and utilizing social media to your advantage. In the ever changing internet and world, social media has almost become a necessity for keeping a company afloat.All in all this is a great book for learning the basics and providing you with some well established information. I would combine this with a few other books likeThe Small Business Start-Up KitandStart Your Own Business, Fifth Edition."
5,Hands up for hybrid techno,"Ruki Vverh is some of the best ""pump you up"" music that you could want. This album is particularly uplifting. It's a techno hybrid of sorts which has strong melodic overtones and is not completely ruled by bass."
5,Wings To Cross An Ocean,"This book is very inspirational, warm, and loving. I regret not writing this review sooner. I feel it has many uplifting words and is not negative in anyway. If only more people would recognize the small things in life and encourage the world as John Paul Padilla has. John Paul goes way out of his way to be there for everyone around him unconditionally. He explains things with thorough simplicity that touches the heart. There are not enough words to say how great this book is nor is there enough time. John Paul reminds us of the beautiful things in life. John Paul offers enormous hope when I thought I was lost. Most of all John Paul reminded me not to ever GIVE UP!!!!! Love You Lots JOHN PAUL PADILLA."
2,Strat Daddy,"I was disappointed, The audio quality was poor and the instrumentation sparse. I am a fan of Crosby, Stills and Nash, but this is not one of their better performances."
2,CS&N Acoustic,"I was fortunate to be able to see a live preformance in my home town about 12 years ago. I don't beleive that this effort is ""up to par""."
2,CSN - Too old to sing,This CD purchase was not one of the best I've ever made. I didn't realize it was recorded in the 90's. CSN just couldn't sing by then.
1,Stills is King,"Anybody that knows anything about music will tell you that Stephen Stills is the greatest guitarist that ever lived. Look his name up on the internet, any site will tell you this. Without him, there is no Crosby, Stills, and Nash. Although they are the best ever together. Stills is lead singer and guitarist"
3,Also disappointed,"I consider myself a fan though I own only two CDs. I've long wanted one of their DVDs, and almost bought this a week ago. As luck would have it, I managed to borrow it from a friend - but was hugely disappointed. I found it very boring. I actually couldn't watch it. I expected more energy, more harmonies, more instrumental. I guess I have to revise my opinion - I'm a fan of their first two CDs. I still have nothing but favourable sentiment for these guys, but won't be rushing into buying any of their DVDs."
5,"Ageless Harmony...Crosby, Stills and Nash","This is an absolutely fabulous concert with the trio, their guitars and a piano. One year ago, I finally got a chance to see CSN live, front row at the Iowa State Fair. As I left the show, I wished I could have had a video of the event. I was so pleased to see that there was concert video available.This DVD was produced and directed as well as any I've ever seen. The surround sound remastered and digital quality video will make you feel like you were there (with the best seats in the house)!The songs performed span their career together and their harmony (as always) will send chills through the body of any true fan of the best trio of all time.Best of the BEST!"
3,Not what I thought,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He watched it once and won't be watching it again. He expected the same perfected sound as on the Greatest Hits CD. Over all, it was a good performance and a good re-visit of the past, but if you love the classic perfect sound, stick with the CD."
2,Eh.,"Not as good as I hoped. Their voices are so much better on their albums that it was sort of annoying to listen to. I was hoping for the Crosby, Stills, and Nash version of the Eagles Farewell concert video, which is incredible. Oh well."
1,Terrible Content & Deceptive Packaging.,"Poor accoustics and Stephen Stills' voice is gone. Cover of DVD showed CS&N thirty years ago, giving impression that concert occurred then. Concert probably happened after 2000 and they ain't what they used to be. Worst concert video I've ever seen."
2,"Poorly done, edited","Please ignore my previous positive review. Avoid this edition. Upon careful analysis with the unedited originals, many changes have been discovered. A huge disappointment after trusting Acropolis NOT to edit. [...]"
1,EDITED AND ALTERED,"Although one of Joel's first books, please note that it is not the original. Much has been altered and edited. Infinite Way students, please seek out the original of this book, it is available and will serve you well."
2,bad experientce with the Wok shop,I bought a 12 inch wok. The description said it's 4 inch in depth. But I received the wok only 3 inch in depth. I called the shop asked the question. The person answered my phone is very rude. I will never do business with this shop again.
3,Good things come in large packages.,"I have finally tried out a new PowerBook 17"", and it was great. Everything in a desktop computerin an oversized PowerBook case. This can run anything I threw at it easily, and it looks great. A new light keyboard makes this great too. With larger speakers, music sounds normal, not like a pillow is covering the speakers. While this is great, it is not a laptop. This thing is a behemoth. It is so big and heavy, I don't think it is meant to be portable. Why not have a desktop if you can't move this thing. Other than that this is a great mac, with infinite possiblities."
4,Incredible Story!!,"I remember reading the book for the first time in jr.high school, and then watching the movie. It's been about 14 years since I have seen & read the story, and it remains one of the best book & movie's I have ever read & seen. I must say that the book was a lot more interesting than the movie. I highly recommend reading it. However, I must say that Kathleen Quinlan was great in the movie version. Regardless of whether you read or see the story, it will not disappoint. I give it 2 thumbs up!!!"
3,"Very Interesting, but also Confusing","The novel ""I Never Promised You a Rose Garden"" was an extremely moving book. At times I felt I could connect with Deborah, being that I have been though therapy and I've seen a continuous line of psychologists. I was assigned this book for a summer reading program as I went into 9th grade. At first I thought it would be relatively easy reading, as I already read books such as Anne McCaffrey's, the Dragonlance books, and others. This however, was a different story. It was twisting and occasionally confusing, but I still enjoyed it. I loved to hear of her times with her friends and the other patients. I knew they'd always have interesting things to say. I especially liked when she and Carla, ""crazy"" as they were, ran out into the night and still came back, with no punishment. The doctor really trusted them, and I admire that. All in all, ""I Never Promised You a Rose Garden"" was a very, very good book"
3,True story!,"This is actually a true story (although it is fictionalized somewhat). At the time, so much shame was associated with having a history like that she originally published it under the pseudonym ""Hannah Green."" It took place at Chestnut Lodge in Maryland, and her psychiatrist, Furii, was Freida Fromm-Reichmann, a well known and respected psychoanalyst at the time. She had been married (and divorced, I believe) from Eric Fromm, another well known psychoanalyst and author of The Art of Loving."
2,Disappointing,"I am a Freshman in high school, and I found this book to be rather slow and confusing. It had more of a science fiction feel than I anticipated, with the main character's other world. It seems like the author knows what she wants to say with the other world, but she's not making it clear to the reader, atleast to me. The book was kinda boring in the beginning, but it gets more interesting. Even so, while I was reading it, I was waiting for it to end. When it was over I didn't think it was a terrible book, but the ending was nothing spectacular. I wouldn't recommend it, except maybe if you're big on science fiction."
3,I am sixteen and I tried to understand this sixteen year old,"I read this book a long time ago and I thought that re-reading it would help me to understand it more. The girl, Deborah, is more screwed up than meets the eye. I had a hard time following this story, not because of my age. I am an avid reader and I understand most books and storylines, but this book totally messed with my brain. I would not recommend this book to anyone who has not had any mental illness for, they will not understand it very well. those who have said that this is a good book, lied."
2,I did not enjoy reading this book.,"When I first picked the book in the library it looked very interesting. But, then I started reading it and changed my opinion. First of all, the story starts out at the family's house, but then the girl starts getting her mental problems in her head about this place called Year. And that's when the story gets very confusing. It makes you crazy. Later in the story she goes into a mental hospital. I thought that part was interesting because they told you about it and the psychiatrist. Personally, I would not recommend this book to be read. Unless you are the type of person that can really understand someone's mental and emotional problems."
2,One book you can live without!,"This has to be one of the worst novels I have ever read... It starts out pretty good, but becomes confusing in the middle and the end of the book. I know it was based on a true story, and I really feel sorry for the person who lived through it, but the novel stunk!"
5,Absolutely FANTASTIC!,Masterfully weaves a tale of a troubled young girl and her trials and discoveries in a mental institution. Powerfully portraysthe strength of the human mind. A definite buy!
3,This book is now severely dated.,"The diagnosis of Deborah Rau in the book is schizophrenia, and that is how she would have been diagnosed at the time the book was written, in the late 50's, early 60's, before psychiatrists acknowledged the role that chemical imbalance plays in mental illness. This book should not be considered an accurate ""case history"" of a schizophrenic, nor should the Freudian analysis that Deborah undergoes be considered an appropriate treatment for schizophrenia.However, the book gives an accurate and realistic portrayal of the treatment of mental illnes during that particular time period, including involuntary committal, patient restraint, Freudian analysis being used for severe psychosis, etc. It's interesting as a period piece."
3,You have to understand that psychiatry doesn't work this way anymore,"This book is rather horribly dated. Mental hospitals and the treatment of schizophrenia in the 1960s have very little in common with those things today. Deborah spent years in the hospital, treated with such things as cold packs (wrapping her mummy-like in cold wet sheets) and psychotherapy, rather than the anti-psychotic drugs they used today. The author based the book on her own experiences, but I have read that her schizophrenia diagnosis was probably inaccurate and she most likely suffered from depression with psychotic features.This book might be good for people who want to know what the mental health system was like in the sixties, but I don't think it would do a schizophrenic person any good as far as getting insight into their illness and treatment."
1,Forget about this one.,"I am an avid reader and enjoy novels in this genre such as Sybil, by Schreiber, et cetera. Yet this novel was so deeply clinical that it could not hold my attention. I was more than halfway through the book and definitely not interested. I really do not recommend it and I do not understand why it was a national bestseller."
2,Was she trying to confuse us?,"I don't understand the author's need to try to confuse the reader. Signet writes in this book sentences, which sometimes may be necessary for the reader's knowledge of the situation, but other times gets rather annoying, that are so long and boring and tell every detail about the current situation's history over the last ten years, that by the time you reach the end of it, 45 years later, you have totally forgotten what the point of it, and the rest of the story was. I can't tell you how many times I went back and counted the number of lines one sentence would take up and find that they were the length of a good paragraph. This style of writing makes the book choppy and hard to follow."
1,eye-roller,I've been trying to finish this book for about 2 years now and everytime I pick it up I roll my eyes at each instance of her slipping into her fantasy world.The book's language is way too advanced to describe a young teen and seems more like it was written by the psychiatrist instead of 3rd person narration. Every time the fantasy world is described I keep imagining the author sitting at her typewriter trying to invent nonsense words.Everytime I try to keep reading I want to throw it into traffic.
3,A young girl in her own world,"...Reading this book for me has been a pleasure. It has taken me deeper inside my own mind and has pushed me further in my desire to become a psychiatrist. I loved the book, it really shows how all people aren't bad. Deborah mainly taught me just that. Everyone in the world isn't out to hurt you and that a little trust can go a long way. This book is inspiring to me and maybe others who have read it to help those people like Deborah who just don't know how to ask for help and really need it."
5,Not an easy read....,".... but well worth the time. Deep.... very deep. I'll have this one on my mind for a long, long time."
5,I never,This book had a great impact on me in my 20s. I have met other women that it also impacted. I sent copies to youth centers. To recognize that the world of humans is itself insane can often be the first step to individual sanity
5,I never promised you a rose garden,"excellent story, well written, a bit hard to follow with the fantasy parts in this story but they do fit in well."
5,Great book.,it's a great book if you ever have had any kind of mental illness. I could somewhat relate to her world. I fell easily in reading this book I picked it up one day and read it in two days. I could not put it down. I decided to reread it after reading it 15 years ago. It still haunts me. I can really relate. Though I would recommend with caution in reading this book as it's very haunting and could set you back. I was spell bound by it for days later. It's a great read.
4,Brief Comments about I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,Good insight into the symptoms of schizophrenia. Shows understanding of mental illness based on scientific knowledge of 1960's. Well written.
3,One teenager's choice between the Kingdom of Yr and reality,"I agree with a couple of other reviewers that Ms Greenberg seemed to be suffering from autism and depression, and not schizophrenia. Many passages sounded more like something out of ""Nobody Nowhere"" the classic first-hand account of autism. But the diagnosis occurred a long time ago and I'm not a trained clinician. Where the book was best was in the detailed description of Ms Greenberg's confused understanding of reality and fantasy, cause and effect. The book was at its weakest in overall style, giving us full omniscience in a range of characters that clashed with the tone of a detailed first-hand account and unrealistic dialog out of the mouth of a 16-year-old. But even that weakness lends a certain authenticity to the book. A much more polished version would not have the same credibility as one written by someone who in some senses was only an amateur."
4,Life is not beautiful,"Have you ever felt you can go on in life, and you just want to give up? Try reading, I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,by Hannah Green where she talks about a mental ill girl called Deborah. Deborah is sent to a mental ill hospital where she meets Dr. Fried which tries to help her. Deborah goes through the tuffest four years of her life. She feels like giving up all the time, but her doctor tells her, ""I never promised you a rose garden."" Deborah goes on even with her health problems and confronts the world. Read this book and you will see what problems she goes through."
3,Poor writing,"Although the concepts and story expressed are excellent, the level of writing is very poor. It is all ""telling,"" no ""showing."" It is as if you are reading a book written by a 9th grader. Otherwise, it is very interesting, absorbing, and moving, especially if you can get past the first 100 pages."
2,False information,"Warning! if you are reading this book because you want to know more about schizophrenia, look somewhere else! the girl in this book should not have been classified as a schizophrenic. it is a good read but confuses the symptoms of the diagnosis. if you want to read a book about an actual schizophrenic try ""is there no place on earth for me"" by susan sheehan, or if you need info on the illness ""Surviving Schizophrenia"" by e fuller torrey is very helpful."
5,An amazing insight into the mentally ill,"This book respectfully offers a view of the mentally ill. It's so well written, I walk away from a chapter feeling amazed at the fortitude of those who are not mentally well. It's an interesting perspective not often put forward: the mental institution offering protection & not imprisonment, the need to be sick to get better. I found the main charactor Deborah believable & her fears understandable. I liked the description of those who protect themselves with the false ""fine-fine."" It made me laugh at the idiosyncracies of the sane, too."
3,Sort of confusing,"Somewhat enlightening, but I was confused by the rapid transitions from the real world to her imaginary world of Yr. It was also sort of boring, but I liked the way it gave her thoughts as well as the thoughts of her psychiatrist."
4,"Regardless of her actual diagnosis, a great read","INPYARG is a well-written book from the perspective of a highly intelligent adolescent girl. Recent mental health professionals that have analyzed the work do not see her symptomology as schizophrenic/psychotic, but as severe depression, loneliness, and possibly autism, a combination of which led to her ""creative"" inner detached world.Regardless of what her diagnosis may be today, Green does a wonderful job of capturing the mindset of someone with severe mental illness who is crying for help and simultaneously fears the change that is associated with mental health. A must read for anyone in the field, and highly recommended to anyone else looking for a good read."
3,Mental Anguish,The author used a very detailed account of a patient's dilemma with mental illness. Although the book is good the reader has to be knowledgeable about psychological disorders.
3,Confusing yet Educational,"I recantly read Hannah Green's book for an extra credit novel that I could take in my Literature class. I enjoyed the book, but at times I found it hard to understand. I would only recomend this book if you are a person who is truely intrested in mental illness. I belive that it should be read by the more advanced reader. At times, I think that everyone would be able to see themself in Deborah's shoes. Eventhough this book was a little difficult to understand, I think that I learned alot about mental illness by reading it. If you are curious in that field I would defiantly recomend it."
2,Cute but not overly intelligent,"While the book does bring to light many reasons to hate the Yankees, it does very little to back the argument of why they should be hated. Moreso, the book actually strengthens the reasons why the Yankees are so successful and have the largest fan base of any team, because they win. I did like the many side notes and jabs at the Yankees, but it seems that is the real focus of the book, rather than explaining why so many may love and hate the team. The format of the book and style of the pages can at time be a bit confusing to follow. The book tends to come across as a cut and paste collage of pokes at the Yankees from a few guys, nothing more. Cute. Read it and toss book."
5,My Favorite Flatt & Scruggs Album,"This album will have you tapping your toes,and when it's finished it will leave you wanting more. These 20 songs are Flatt & Scruggs best. The ""Foggy Mountain Breakdown"" on this album is the best rendition that I've heard. This album is a great collection of the type of music that the artists were most noted for."
5,Watch out John Grisham,Love Grippando's suspense and plots. He is a rival for Grisham...actually I like Grippando better. More realistic author. This book grabs your attention and 5 hours later you are still reading and everyone else has went to bed. Characters are realistic and you learn to care for them.
2,A ludicrous plot involving people who do not act rationally,"I believe this is the third book by this author that I have read and I did enjoy the earlier books.I have also read the Amazon reprints of the various book review publications as well as several reader reviews.We must have been reading different books.Usually a book is called ""over the top"" when the plot requires you to suspend belief, but the book is otherwise entertaining. The only words to describe this book would be ludicrous and preposterous. The plot flaws(after you have finished think back on such things as the woman in the bar in Panama and how she could have ended up there) are one thing, but the last 40 or 50 pages involve people doing things that no one in the world (even in thrillers) would consider doing. For example, ""meet me at the dam at 2AM"". This is a dam 50 miles away in the middle of nowhere. Then there is one denouement after the other, until the final one which is ridiculous. PULEEEZ--GIVE ME A BREAK!!!"
1,Irritatingly predictable,"While reading this I constantly found myself wondering what on earth the characters were thinking. Why were they doing such incredibly stupid things?The book became increasingly irritating towards the end and was a waste of time and money. One of the very few, maybe the only book, I stopped reading less than fifty pages from the end."
4,A good read but......,"I enjoyed the book but found it a little lacking to the others of his I have read. Possibly it is me and I suffer to many thrillers and serial killers, hard to say. Still all in all a very good story well ploted out with Colorado as a good background and two nice people that deserved more than they had received in life. I would recommend the book actually on its fine readability."
3,"overall, quite good, but several inaccuracies","Good plot and action. The book takes place in Colorado and, as a resident, I found several facts in the book that were not accurate. At times, we have 10% humidity in the summer, yet the book referred several times to the ""sticky"" heat. Also, the town of Rocky Ford is famous for the cantelope that is grown there and is known as the ""melon capital"" of Colorado. Imagine my surprise when the book talked about the ""watermelon"" festival. Not so, Mr. Grippando. There were several other references that overall were small, but detracted nonetheless from the authenticity."
2,"Gosh, NO, I Really Didn't Like This. Read Why.","The initial premise was great. You find a fortune in your attic, no one knows about it, it's in small bills, been there for years, not counterfeit, no one's looking for it, you can do whatever you wish with it. After my initial disgust with the hero's (hero?) over zealous need to make sure this money is ""untainted"", that he really has a legal right to it, I began to develop an interest in the somewhat complicated plot, even though the writing was not stellar. But the ending pissed me off. Totally unrealistic shoot um up scene with way too many contrived twists in the plot. I didn't buy it; I didn't like it. I was sorry I invested so much time for such a lame payoff. I had expected something more satisfying."
1,"Removes metal quickly, sharpens poorly","I purchased two of these as potential gifts, and tried one out on a pocket knife that I knew could hold a good edge. The diamond fingers quickly put a decent 20-degree bevel on the blade, but never got it sharp enough to slice paper. The diamond grit is simply too coarse to produce a decent edge; I needed to run it through a pair of crock sticks for a minute or so to get it sharp enough to shave the hair on my forearm. And if you have crock sticks, you don't need the Furi Ozitech..."
5,simply the best,I love this product. This is my third one. I cook professionally and in a few short swipes I have a sharp blade at work or at home instead of dealing with a stone or ruining my knife with one of those grinders. I've tried a lot of other sharpeners. The Wusthoff sharpener pitted my knives and was immediately trashed. This one fixed the pits without removing a lot of extra steel. My knives are an investment and a crucial tool in my job. This is a life-saver and so easy to use. Part of the reason I go through them so fast is that everyone at work always wants to use mine! They are fascinated by the simple and effective design. I cannot say enough about how much easier this makes my job. I love it and will continue to buy them.
4,Furi FUR626 Ozitech Diamond Fingers Pro Knife Sharpener,"Easy to use but haven't used it much. I should make more, and better, use of it. Stores very nicely into a compact container."
4,Nice and sharp,"Despite the gimmicky sales pitch, this sharpener made the Rachel Ray knife so sharp it cut through an avocado, directly through the pit, and in to my boyfriends hand. The nice thing is it is so sharp he didn't even feel it. -At least not at first anyway."
4,Does the job,"This is a good knife sharpener with a couple of minor issues.Pros:- Folds up to be nice and compact - fits easily into a drawer- The clips on the side fold out to serve as finger guards. If you hold this right, it is almost impossible to accidentally cut yourself.- It sharpened even the dullest of our knivesCons:- It sometimes takes quite a bit of work to pull the knife through the ""fingers"", especially with thicker knives. Maybe I'm pushing the knife down too deep?- Sharpening can sometimes be a slow process, compared to other methods- Sharpener feels a bit flimsy (but hasn't broken yet, so maybe it's just the appearance)"
4,"Sharpens knives, great price","I think I found this from a link on [...] and it's been great to keep my knives nice and sharp. The price is reasonable too - which is important when the knives only cost $20 in the sale bin at Marshalls. If you have dull knives, I recommend this to sharpen them again. If your knives are super far gone, you might need a professional to sharpen them and then use this every few months afterwards"
4,Great for deer cleaning knives!,We bought two of these after using a friends. Great for the deer camp - compact & fits in a pocket and works great!
2,Disappointing,"I bought this product years ago and found it to work surprisingly well for an inexpensive sharpener. I finally wore out the diamonds and had to replace it. The replacement was identical to the original in every way, except when I used it, it not only didn't sharpen the knives, it made a terrible screeching noise like there's no diamond, only bare metal. I real shame. Time to find another make. I would only give it one star except the original worked so well."
2,Not the same Diamond fingers as before,"This Diamond Fingers is not the same as the one from a few years ago. This one doesn't hone very well at all & if you're not very careful, it will etch your knives. I would not recommend this one at all. If you can find the old model I'd jump on it. The old model had longer ""Fingers"" & they had little rubber buttons near the top of the fingers, although I'm not sure the rubber buttons served any real purpose, but the old model worked great & this one doesn't work well at all. I'd recommend using a honing (sharpening) steel or whet stones."
1,Five stitches to close wounds,I have just come home from the emergency room to have a two inch wound closed with five stitches. The Furi ozitech Diamond Fingers knife sharpner is cumbersome and hard to hold. The knife slipped and cut my thumb badly. I would not recommend this knife sharpner to anyone.
2,Great on Tomatos,"Others give technical reviews on why this is, but here is what I've found. Upon opening and preparing to use the sharpener, I felt somewhat exposed to danger and the grip is small and apparently designed to be secured with the knuckles.Five or six semi-hard strokes puts a nice serrated edgew on my knives that slice one hell of a tomato. The edges last longer on some knives than others, but in no case is it a long-lasting edge. One knife actually needs to be resharpened after one tomato!If you need to sharpen knives for tomatos, then this is your sharpener.Roslyn ManleyIrvine, California"
4,absolutely worth the money,"Very effective, and reasonably priced combination of form following function.It works very well on good knives although the performance is (clearly) inferior on lower-end cutlery."
4,Works as described,"Really easy to use. Need to be aware that it's a sharpening, not a honing tool, though... It will ""eat"" your blade fast if you use it all the time."
4,"no es maravilloso ,pero sirve","tal y como dije no hace maravillas pero hace el trabajo , tengo un set clasic de henckel y luego de utilizar este amolador tendo que usar la chaira (de henkel)para alinear el edge de mis cuchillos"
5,Furi Ozitech diamond fingers pro knife sharpener,I use it everyday to sharpen my knives and it works really good.
3,Furi Ozitech Diamond Fingers Knife Sharpener,I am happy with the Pro Knife Sharpener. It does a good job and is easy to use.
1,disappointed,"I was raised on the idea that a dull knife will cut you quicker than a dull one, and so you should always keep a very finely honed edge on all knives. Unfortunately, I found that this product does not come close to the old sharpening stone and the knowledge of how to use it. I also felt instructions on using it were inadequate in regard to how much pressure you should apply. For example, I have since tried a simpler product that pointed out a light touch would give a finer edge, which turns out to be true. I guess like most things that promise a quick fix, the promise is too good to be true."
3,knife sharpener,"The mini-Furi is probably not up to par to the full size one.It takes afew tries to realize that knifes should not be fully insertedbetween the fingers, since only the tips do the sharpening.It is OK, but enough to rave about it.For the price it is fine."
4,Pretty Sharp,This product works well. My knives were fairly dull and the product returned it to a decent level of sharpness. The knives are no where near factory. When I bought my knives they could cut you and you wouldn't even realize it. I would say that this product was worth the money but don't expect factory level sharpness.
4,Works Great,"This sharpened my Furi knife set (and other knifes) as promised, it was really easy to use and store as well. I recommend it."
1,Furi Fur626 Ozitech Diamond Fingers Knife Sharpener,"This item works nicely for about the first 3 sharpenings, after that it stops sharpening and dulls your knives. After a recomendation thought this would work out well, unfortunately not. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS WORTHLESS PIECE OF GARBAGE. Sadly I bought two, one for a gift which I would be embarased to give."
1,knife sharpener,I have an older one of these sharpeners and wanted another. When I ordered it it got here just like I expected but they had changed the design slightly. The sharpening material on the old version was almost impregnated in the fingers and the new one had it just glued on with little strips. The new design is terrible because the knife catches on the little strips and doesn't work anywhere near as good as the older one I already have.They cheapened up the design and it is terrible. I'm going to keep using the old one for as long as I can because the new one isn't anywhere near as good.
2,No Love For Cutco Knives,"I purchased the Furi FUR626 Ozitech Diamond Fingers Pro Knife Sharpener hoping that it would prevent me from having to ship our set of Cutco knives to the ""factory"" for sharpening. Unfortuantely, Furi let me down. After about 20+ strokes total trying to sharpen the big Cutco cutting knife, it was still just as dull as ever.I watched the video on [...] website numerous time to make sure I was using the correct procedure, to no avail. Still have dull Cutco knives.Maybe it works better on softer metal???Time to ship the blades off to Cutco. ARGH!!!!"
2,Not worth the $$$$,"This sharpener is flimsy at best. It does a fair job of straitening blade but by no means sharpens it. They same process as can be accomplished with a steel. I would think that monies are better spent on putting towards a good steel. If I had to do it again, I would not purchase this item."
3,Knife Sharpener,It works as advertised. I can't compare it to other knife sharpeners but for the price it does the job. Was a little disappointed that it did not sharpen scissors or serrated edged knives.
2,Furi FUR626 Ozitech Diamond Fingers Pro Knife Sharpener,"I have tried to sharpen several knives with this sharpener and have had very little luck in getting or maintaining a sharp edge on any of them, especially toward the tip of the knife. I would not recommend this item."
5,Lizzt say's,I think this is the best sharpener I we have ever used. The first time we used it was at a relative's home in New Orlean's. Great sharpener!!
2,FURI OZITECH DIAMOND SHARPENER,"I PURCHASED THIS SHARPENER BUYING INTO THE HYPE ON THE NET ABOUT IT. IT CLAIMS THAT 2 OR 3 SWIPES ON A KNIFE WITH A GOOD EDGE WILL DO THE TRICK. I TRIED MY FURI EAST WEST KNIFE THAT WAS ABOUT 3 DAYS OLD ON IT. 4 SWIPES DID NOTHING, SO TRIED 8 OR 9 MORE. NOT GOOD. THE SAME TIME I BOUGHT THE FURI SHARPENER I BOUGHT THE ACCUSHARP FOR $4.00 LESS. 2 SWIPES WITH THE ACCUSHARP AND THE SAME KNIFE WAS LIKE A RAZOR. I DON'T KNOW WHY I GAVE THE FURI SHARPENER 2 STARS INSTEAD OF NONE,I GUESS I JUST FELT BAD. I WOULD SPEND LESS MONEY AND BUY THE ACCUSHARP."
2,Certainly not as well made as...,"the one you see on the Amazon page: the sharpening fingers are not as well covered with the diamond dust, the angle of the fingers curve is different, so you cannot apply any pressure on the knife, or the edge of the knife goes down past the area covered with diamonds and gouges the steel of the fingers, without sharpening anything. This is a disappointment.I will write to the Manufacturer and demand better made fingers.As to the shell, if you are over the age of 10, you should have no problems with its opening, as long as you look closely at it, and treat it with some gentleness. As usual with things you do not know how to open or take apart, do not force or cut anything until you figure out the procedure (or even, surprise, surprise!... Read The Fu*#$@&g; Manual!)."
3,Fabulous Sharpener but Flimsy Cover,"Works beautifuly and is easy to use. However, one of the side panels that opens the device has torn after only a few months of careful use. It has not interfered with the sharpener itself but is awkward to close. For the life of me cannot find an email address for the manufacturer's representatives to report this problem."
1,crap!,"The ""diamond"" coating on the ""Fingers"" began flaking off after the first few swipes! Total garbage, don't waste your time."
1,Scratches blades,"I tried this on several knives. It sharpened them, but left permanent scratches on all of them. This makes it worthless, unless you like to scar your blades in order to get them sharp. I received two sharpeners and both scratched blades, so I assume it is an integral design flaw."
2,Not The Sharpest Knife In The Drawer,I was only mildly impressed with the sharpness of the knives and found the sharpener clumsy to use.
4,"A good sharpener, especially at the price.","Yes, it sharpens my knives. It is easy/simple to use and folds away to become an easily stored package. So many types of knife sharpeners, which one to choose ? Did my research, read reviews and compared pricing and these seemed to be right. And they were."
1,broke apart,This is the 2nd one that I have bought. I loved the 1st one - it got old - so I decided to buy a new one. I am upset that the new one fell apart after only a few months of use.
3,"Good Product, Sub-Par Case Design","Bought this sharpener with the thought of buying one for my mother-in-law, if it performed well. It was delivered quickly (kudos to Summerdale_House) and removed it from it's hermetically sealed packaging, which not easy feat. The sharpening ""fingers"" come encased in a plastic clam shell type case. I like the design of the sharpening mechanism. I closed the shell, secured it with the two plastic ""wings"" and proceeded to reverse the process...one of the plastic clasps broke. Velcro or a rubber band would've made for better design!I now wonder how durable the overall design will be. I'll continue to search for a suitable sharpener for my mom-in-law :("
1,what's this product do?,"This product is terrible,I can sharpen a knife better using a rock from my yard. What a disapointment this was."
1,Diamond coating flaked off at first use,"Read the negative reviews of this product and let the buyer beware. I received my sharpener today, used it today, and the abrasive coating is already flaking off the steel prongs of the ""fingers."" Extremely dissatisfied."
1,Worn down in a matter of weeks,"After reading numerous positive reviews as well as a strong quality report, I was suprised when the 'diamond' edging began to flake away almost immediately. Having it for only a couple of months, I noticed that the one tine was partially stripped. Since that time, it seems like every use causes more to flake off. I doubt it will last 6 months before it will be unusable. Very disappointing!"
4,Knife Sharpener,I really enjoy using the knife sharpener. My Knife cuts through anything now. The case is kinda cheesy.But for the price you can't go wrong.
3,Furi Fingers,"Interesting device. Seems to true up the feather edge from various other sharpening efforts. STILL, I get the best razor sharp edges with a TORMEK wet SUPER GRIND set up. But it is not always convenient to use the TORMEK, so alternatives like FURI are a welcome addition...Well worth a look!!"
1,It damaged my knife. Posted picture.,"I bought one of these back in June 2006 and it worked beautifully. My mother in-law was visited and commented on it. I gave her mine since she is leaving the next day and I don't have time to order her a new one. Then I bought another one. This was a HUGE mistake. The quality doesn't seem to be the same. When I ran my knife through the first time, it made this terrible metal scraping noise. I thought maybe I have to break it in so I tried it a few more times. Then I noticed scratched on the edge of the knife. I took a close up photo so you can see it for yourself. Unfortunately, I threw the away the packaging thinking that it will work as great as the last one. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money because you may end up having to pay more to fix the damage."
2,Not That Great,"I don't understand why this product gets such great reviews. Frankly, I don't think it's much better than a honing steel. It's definitely not a knife sharpener. I should have saved the $$ and put it toward and electric sharpener."
3,works as advertised...but not as well as you might expect,"It does works, but not the end all beat all of sharpeners. It does put a 20 degeree agle on the blade and it is capable of sharpening ceramics. However it takes more than just a 3 or 4 strokes especialy if your setting an edge or sharpening a very dull knife. It also leaves a very ""rough"" cutting edge and still takes a bit of work with some ceramic rods and a leather strop to get that ""tomato drop"" edge. I'd advise you to save your money and buy a lansky system or something like it.Pros: almost as good as advertised, decent for the money, (big)pocket sized, sharpens ceramic bladesCons: ""rough"" cutting edge, not as quick as advertised, may damage the point on clip point or stiletto style blades"
5,The Essential knife sharpener,"I've been using my Ozitech sharpener for over a year and it still works miracles on my Furi (and other) knives.It works so well, that we bought one for the inlaws, and they are having great success with keeping their knives sharp using this tool.My only complaint is that the flaps on each side of the open sharpener have come off. Perhaps this is because of how often we use it,or maybe we aren't gripping it properly? But it still works fantastic, and my complaint isn't enough to take away any of this products 5 stars.Well done, Furi!"
2,Not Impressive,"As a collector of sorts of various blades, I wanted to be sure this item worked well before I tried it on some of my better knives. Its performance was slightly above mediocre when I tried it out and if you are new to knife-sharpening, I can definitely see how you could get scratches on the side of your blades. This item did sharpen a blade or two but only a little and it is very very loud and annoying. I much prefer sharpening blocks."
3,Poorly made,The case is badly designed to the point where safety is a concern. The diamonds wore off after about two months. I did work well initially before the diamonds disappeared.
2,Diamonds wear off fast,"The Furi Ozitech knife sharpener works well, but the diamonds wear off the ""fingers"" very quickly and then it doesn't work well."
4,This is a good sharpener if your knife edge is the correct angle,"I have a few knives that are the right and that this sharpener is made for and it does a great job on those knives. If your knife was made with a different angle than the fingers sharpen at then this sharpener will not work. Before you start to sharpen your knife lightly draw your knife through the fingers. If you see scratches on your blade other than the cutting edge than this knife will not work well, If it does match you knife it does a great job. Good Luck"
3,It works but won't last after a few uses.,"I was skeptical about this product. After using some dull knives on it, I was surprised to find out that it actually gave them an edge. As it was mentioned in another review, the problem with the product is that after a few uses, the fingers will start to lose their diamond coating and will end up having to get another one if you really like this product."
4,Not bad,"It works for the most part. I am not going to say it gets knives to restaurant quality sharp, but it works for an in home kitchen."
1,worthless,worst than worthless. Take your knives to a professional sharpening service instead of spending your cash on this device. You'll be ahead of the game.
2,Just another cheap sharpener,"There are less expensive less awkward sharpeners out there that will do just as good a job.Like the ""AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpener"" for about half the price."
3,I've used better,"I have used many different sharpeners ranging from wet stones, diamond blocks, and some other pull through sharpeners. The Ozitech puts a decent edge on most blades. Other forms of sharpening create better edges. A downfall of this sharpener is that I had no idea of how hard to push the blade down into the ""diamond fingers"". Apparently, after I pulled the knife through, I had pushed down too hard and scratched the sides of the blade. This sharpener is fine if you don't need a super sharp knife."
3,Not sure yet,"Just got this, it does not seem to work that great, not sure if we are using it correctly, our old knifes seem just as dull as before after using. I know about the Tech model, maybe that is what we need ? My wife is a chef and has some very good knifes, but she doesn't think this is that great."
2,Where's the ending?,"This book has been sitting in my bookshelf for several years, and for some reason I didn't read it until now. It's a standard murder mystery, but well written. I had read the other customer review here on Amazon.com before I finished the book, so I was prepared for the ending, which certainly is a disappointment. In a mystery novel, the mystery is supposed to be solved. In this book, everybody thinks the mystery is solved, except for Wycliffe, so the investigation continues, and more evidence is unearhted, making their initial theory less probably, but Wycliffe for some reason decide not to proceed with the case.With a proper ending, this would have been a pretty good mystery novel, but it's not. You'd be better off with most other murder mysteries instead of this one. Not recommended."
2,Ugh... All songs are re-recorded or alternate versions,"I bought this album expecting to hear my favorite Johnny Paycheck songs, but I was disappointed with it. All of the songs are re-recordings or alternate versions.... Not the versions of the songs that you've heard on the radio and know and love. The information on the CD does not provide any indication of when these songs were recorded, but it sounds like they were recorded by a MUCH OLDER Johnny Paycheck than the original recordings.Heaven's Almost As Big As Texas -- the version on this album doesn't have any of the punch of the original.I subsequently bought The Soul and the Edge, and was much happier with that, thought to get Heaven's Almost As Big as Texas, I ended up also ordering the album, Take This Job and Shove it.Oh well."
2,IMPRESSIONS...,"I keep getting the feeling while reading these books that Mr. Spalding did not have these experiences, he created them in a study. It's not that they're not possible -- there are none that challenge my credulity -- it is simply my continuing impression that Mr. Spalding has taken everything exciting he has read about higher consciousness, combined it with what he believes, and offers up this ""epic"" as historical fact.I would have preferred that he present it as fiction, would have found that more powerful."
1,These books are a hoax,"Please do not fall for these books, they are purely imaginary. It does matter when things are made up and passed off as true, and is contrary to the whole point of the spiritual journey. My sister was involved in a cult in Denver Colorado based on these books for several years and I deeply regret this."
1,Wake up!,"Okay folks, it's time to wake up. First, it's been written on good authority that Spalding wrote the first three volumes of this ""fantasy"" before he ever left the United States, later admitting having visited these ""masters"" while in his astro-body. And then there is the overall racist tone to his writing. I am amazed no one has yet to mention this in a review (at least none that I've read). Spirituality based on racism is not true spirituality. If I could give it less than a single star, I would. Wake up America!"
2,unhappy,I got this as a gift for a friend and received a 5 volume set not the 6 as advertised. Because this was a Christmas gift I didn't have time to deal with it. I had a really hard time explaining to my friend why he got 5 volumes & he had seem 6 in my set.Very upset with this seller as is my friend
1,These books are a hoax...sorry.,"Sorry to burst everyone's bubble here, but these books have been determined to be a hoax - by Spalding himself.I'm as ""New Age"" as the next guy but we can't go on pretending things happen that didn't really happen. Same thing with the 100th monkey story. That too was stretched to fit the theory of superconsciousness.I am a New Age teacher. I've listed the Spalding books as well as Casteneda's material in my bibliographies. But since I am looking for the truth - the pure naked truth - I've been forced to remove them from my list of recommended reading. I don't think that facts need to be altered in order for New Age thinking to flourish.I hope you agree."
5,"At last, at last, real food for the soul!","If you have ever been hungry to know what IT is, here IT is! Savor each page of each book as delicious, incomparably precious, cool succulence poured slowly upon the parched, questing pate of your feverish search. Imbibe the wisdom directly as known only between lost heart and questing heart. There are worlds and universes between these words which can only be experienced with your eyes closed, and with a faintly curved smile of rapturous pleasure as the long-awaited loving touch of One Beloved is revealed, openly, at last. Quaff, touch, cry, hear, smell, taste, see, be...."
5,life and teaching of the masters of the far east,"These are excellent books for anyone intrested in the truer journey we are meant to take ( my opinion). Book #1 was excellent , book #2 was better, book #3 is even better... Im just finishing the 3rd book but I sincerelly look foreward to the rest!!!"
5,Outstanding!!!!,"I read this set of books originally back in 1989 along with Ramtha's White book. It remains a huge part of my life. There are people who spend a lot of time spreading information about Baird Spalding being a fake and never really going to India much less experiencing the Masters. I do not listen to any of that. I believe in these books and do not doubt that Baird Spalding had these experiences. Besides, the most important things about these books is what is presented inside. This is the secret of life and how it really works. I have much love and gratitude to the Masters and Baird T. Spalding. I will never deny any of you no matter what anyones says in criticism.I love you Jesus, Saint Germaine, The Masters of the Far East, Afra, Mary Magdaleine, Sanat Kumra, Akasha, Asun and the rest of you."
5,consciousness raiser,I am in a study group to understand more fully the Christ consciousness. These volumes provided an account of a group of seekers in the late 1800's who traveled to the Far East and spent time with ascended masters recording their journey both physically and spiritually.
5,"""Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far-East","This is just a confirmation of my previous review as my e-mail has changed.This serie of books is the best I ever read;I would like to have some contacts with other readers of B.T.Spalding,to exchange ideas and,perhaps start a study group!"
5,Some of the Best Books in the World!,"These books started me on my path, and with them I have gain much in the ways of thinking, acting and being.Baird T. Spaldings books are a true treasure to anyone who decides to read them.Remember to tell your friends about these books."
5,Life and Teachings of the Masters of the Far East,"This series was simplistically written, the journey reading these books was memorable. I loved the fact that these books were under 200 pages a volume - but do not be fooled by the shortness in length because the message is huge.Linda DeFeverWauconda, Illinois"
1,Supernatural Nonsense Not Enlightenment,"I fail to understand whay so many people have given this book 5 stars. These books are filled with stories of the supernatural...telephathy, teleportation, immortality, etc... While such stories may be entertaining, enlightenment is not the result!"
5,Enigma of the last century,"The writer really takes you inside what you believed only to be esoteric. And when you meet the Masters, it truly comes to Life."
5,Here's to the Quest for a Higher Consciousness,"I have begun the journey into Mr. Spalding's adventures and have come out completely inspired! I had been looking for a book that discussed spirituality but also gave validity to many questions that people have today. This not only celebrates the validity of seeking a more fulfilled existence it truly made me understand that the life and experiences of Jesus are very tangible and possible for one to achieve.Mr. Spalding travels through Tibet among other places and lays out a landscape of magnificence in relating how some of these people here live the life of Jesus and don't really consider it a life ""miracles"" so much as simply and truly living.I have recommended the book since I read it and will keep on doing so. It has helped solidify my own spirituality and beliefs and reminds me there is a MUCH better existence awaiting us all if we just go towards it."
5,Life and Teaching of the Masters of the Far East (6 Volume Set),This is amazing - I wish I had known about this many years ago. It is an encouraging account and places us much closer to spiritual goals and objectives than we ever thought possible given our current situation. This is more worthwhile reading than anything you will pick up!
5,The only books you need!!!!,If you are on a spiritual journey these books are the only books you will ever need. Throw away most everything else you have ever read about God! This is our true journey. Each time you read these books you will have a deeper understanding of their divine truth. If you feel this is your journey please email me at tatiacha@hotmail.com lets talk!
5,I have made the adventure twice,It makes me think that there are always posibilities and new things to learn. I believet that all is similar and different and the roads we travel are amazing.
5,uplifting and transforming,"this series Life and teaching of the Masters of the Far East are great healing tools, the amount of love, insight and light I felt whilst reading them is truly transforming. The stories, and teachings resonated greatly with me and I am so thankful to have be recommended this book by a loved one."
5,A Whole New World,"After years of searching various ideas, I still cling to the hope that the life described in these books is possible. I've owned and loaned three sets of these books. Like the best things we loan to friends, these books never seem to come back; but, I don't mind buying them again...and again...and again."
5,Life and Teachings of the Masters of the Far East,It's exactly what I needed to ascend me to the next step of learning. Probably a quantum step and grateful to Mr. Baird T. Spalding to have written it and to have shared this wisdomm with all of us.
1,ReallY??,"Shame on me for not noticing that this calendar is a 2010 Calendar, but why on earth would you even sell a 2010 calendar in December of 2010??? Ridiculous."
4,College text books,"I was satisfied with the books and the process when we ordered from Amazon. However, one of the professors decided he wasn't going to use the book. If we had waited to get it at the book store a return would have been easier. As it is I have a $65 dollar book I can't use."
5,Motivational and Honest,"I've been weight training for over 20 years. After a while all the bodybuilding books seem to have been written by the same person, and have the same advice. Not this one. It gave me a motivational jolt, and I'm fired up again to hit the weights. There are many ideas in the book I'm trying for the first time, and these training changes are helping me get to where I want to be.I think this really isn't a beginners book...it's a tale of the methods and ideas Dave has found useful for himself from his decades of traing and managing a gym. It gets us old trainers out of our ruts. Take the journey with him...and grow."
4,Wonderfully Written...,"Draper's passion for the iron game shows on every page of this book. Part autobiography, part iron game philosophy, and part how-to manual, this book does a good job of covering every aspect of your training. Dave's writing style is very motivational and it is clear that he loves his work.There are better books out there on training, but none quite so brilliantly written."
5,"Does not just show you the path, But explains the journey.","The alternate title for this book could have been, ""The Tao of Bodybuilding"". Similiar to Bruce Lees' ""The Tao of Jeet Kun Do"" Mr Draper teaches to use what is useful, discard the rest. He instructs the readers to ""look inside"" to keep your motivation, and even to construct your routines. It is farr better to be in the gym doing an off-beat routine than sitting at home on the couch with the ""perfect"", but uninspiring routine.There are hundreds of books that show you the how, but few tell you the why. If your are looking for pseudo-scientific jargon and ""secret"" eastern training techniques, look elsewhere. they ""give you the fish"". Dave teaches you how to fish."
3,Interesting Reading but do it with a wink wink,"I read the book and enjoyed it and looked at it for what it was---a book thats not really applicable for the average person.What people don't understand is that Mr. Draper, like all body builders of the 60's through today, took steroids to build his stature. Hence, you cannot mimic him in his routines.My advice, if you are looking for advice on working out and building muscle stay with books on natural training and a natural lifestyle."
5,"For those with casual interest, everything you need to know!","Like many people of an older generation, my interest in bodybuilding started when I was a kid, reading Charles Atlas's ads about how to build up muscles to keep bullies from kicking sand in my face. Building huge muscles is an appealing idea, even though relatively few people ever follow through in a serious way. I recently edited a new book (Nature's Ritalin for the Marathon Mind) about how exercise can substitute for drugs in treatment of ADHD. While aerobic exercise is most important, kids who have an interest in bodybuilding have a motivation to include aerobic exercise as part of their regimen.Brother Iron, Sister Steel is a fun and informative book. For people like me who are basically just curious, it's probably everything we need to know about bodybuilding. For the serious practitioner, it's an important resource, with extensive references to the other materials that would be helpful."
3,Not recommended for beginners,"It's an okay book for bodybuilding -- it has schedules for workouts, nutrition, and the like. I just didn't like how it didn't come with instructions on how to do the exercises and illustrations of the exercises."
5,Excellent Training Manual,This book is awesome. It contains alot of information for the beginner and the veteran. Dave writes down to earth and not very technical. He believes in KISS. I highly recommend this book. It is the best book for bodybuilding that I have ever read and I have read a few.
4,A movie for my dad,This was a video that my Dad was desperate to get! I was blessed to find it on Amazon in a used copy. It arrived in the alloted time in perfect condition and was reasonably priced.
4,One of the best openings in Film History,"A lone British tank lumbers through the desert. Further and further into the waste. Inside the crew is unconscious/dead. One man comes to and, in his groggy state, climbs out of the tank and falls to the sand. He struggles to his feet to watch the tank rumble away into the desert. He begins walking north.A guilty pleasure since I first saw it some 45 years ago.Erich von Stroheim's Rommel has to be experienced because you can't explain it.Propaganda is heavy and heavier. In its day, it said a lot. Today it is merely uninentionally funny.Tightly filmed with some wickedly funny moments from Stroheim as Rommel never was nor wanted to be.Finding the five ""graves"" and their true meaning really holds this film together. You will never guess until it is revealed."
5,1 year old heaven!,"My child got these for his 1st birthday and let me just say - every one year old I know from now on will get a Weeble. He loves to spin them on the coffee table. He also uses them like a stacking toy - putting them in their vehicle and taking them out. He has other toy cars he hasn't shown interest in, but these! He loves to put the weeble in the car and push it across the table. He also seems to like their little faces - he picks them up and snickers at them. Even if your child doesn't love it like mine does, you can't go wrong for the price and durability."
2,Not what I was expecting!!!!,"I have read these books from Dr. Wesselman before: The Journey to the Sacred Garden: A Guide to Traveling in the Spiritual Realms, Spirit Medicine, Awakening-Spirit-World-Shamanic- The Shamanic Path Revelation and I really enjoyed his teachings.This book is more about his own experiences which do not interest me due to the fact that everyone that practices Shamanic Journeys what they experience is their own, it is unique. I read a couple of chapters and got absolutely bored."
1,Spiritual Castration,"Just as another anthropologist with a Ph.D. perpetrated a hoax by raping the soul of a culture, while appealing to the drug culture, Wesselman offers a series of Castaneda re-treads, appealing to the masturbatory fantasies of spiritual eunuchs. Summoning every tired new age cliché from the Art Bell lexicon, Wesselman is to mysticism what Jackie Collins is to quantum physics."
2,,"I can go on and divide this review into a ""the good, the bad, the ugly...and the worse"" segment, but I'll just say that this 3CD set of live performances has enough variety in it to please any open minded metal fan. The sound is crystal clear, and the performances aren't that bad. The best performances in my opinion were by Cannibal Corpse, Bal Sagoth, Death Angel, Unleashed, Brainstorm, Motorhead, Dio, and Hobb's Angel of Death. But there's 32 other bands featured, some of them even playing 2 songs, so you have more than enough material to pollute your ears with."
4,an excellent family film,"a very nicely done family film with old favorites like robert vaughn and ron perlman, and a nice turn by mia sara. there is enough comedy and action to keep one's interest, and the violence is played for laughs. myles jefferies is a new up and coming comedic talent to watch for. he is wonderful as archie."
5,"So far, so good!","Solved the check engine light and saved me quite a bit of money. It's been in my 2003 Toyota Sienna for a couple of weeks, and I have no complaints. My mechanic told me to check online to see if I could find a less expensive solution and Amazon and Denso delivered. So far, so good."
5,Perfect Fit! Fixed My P1155 Error Code!,This is a perfect fit for my 2001 Toyota Avalon XLS. My check engine light read P1155. I replaced my front sensor with this part and now my check engine light is off!
3,air fuel sensor.,It has been only 2 weeks since the air fuel sensor was installed. Everything is working well. Only time will tell how the Denso performs.
2,vendor shipped the wrong part!,Description of the product was misleading. Wrong part was shipped. I had to pay the mechanic for scheduling the part install. Description for any part on Amaon should be accurate. I hold Amazon partly responsible for allowing vendors to write anything about the product! not acceptable Azamon!!!
4,Denso Oxygen Sensor in a 2003 Toyota Avalon,"Fast delivery. Works well in a Toyoto Avalon 2003 front bank exhaust manifold. Three restarts, and the check engine light went out."
5,Original Equipment,Sensor arrived very quickly and was exactly as described. It is an original equipment sensor for my 2001 toyota camry. Fit and worked great.
4,Good product for my car,"I had bought this for my 2003 toyota solara v6 automatic noncalif spec vehicle to replace the bank 1 sensor 1 O2 sensor. Be warned, Denso does a confusing job of labeling which sensor is which. When they say the sensor is for the front, it refers to both upstream sensors underneath the hood, while when they say rear, they mean downstream sensors near the exhaust. The Denso 234-9021 was the correct part I needed after ordering the wrong part due to this confusion. I bought the part for 129 on Amazon, best price I could find anywhere. I dunno why the price keeps fluctuating every few days to 135, but look around. I would have given it five stars if Amazon would have shipped it quicker. It was labeled as being ""in stock"" but took about 3 days for them to process it and send it out."
1,Fake!,"Not THE Coasters, just skillful imitators. The differences are subtle, but telling. MINUS five stars. Amazon should not be selling this."
2,Not Orignal Songs,"I ordered this CD thinking I was getting the original released songs. Unfortunately, they are remakes that just don't have the memories. If you've never heard the originals, you may like it, but if you are looking for the orignals like me, don't waste your money. Unfortunately, I was not able to preview any of the songs on my PC."
4,Coaster's Still Fun,This is a nice collection of well-remembered (Love Potion #9) and not so well-remembered (D.W. Washburn) hits from the late 50's and early 60's. Most are still fun to listen to. Worth having in your collection at the right price.
5,The same of 2-D version.,"The movie is very short and the effects are more or lass.If you are buyng for 3-D effects... forget !!!Best you buy "" ENCONTER IN THE THIRD DIMENSION "" with Elvira and others great 3-D effects !!!"
3,"Engaging for kids, but adults too","I had viewed Alien Adventure on an HD channel I get and found it to be a total blast. I have no children and viewed it alone, but I know from expierence with nieces and a nephew that the younger set would enjoy watching the antics of the aliens visiting an unopened theme park and mistaking it for the way the whole planet earth is!The animation is top quality, but the sharpness and clarity usually found in animation films is not of the best quality on the disk. I did not view the 3-D version since I did not have the equipment to do so. (You will need more than a pair of 3-D glasses)The other con is it is way too short, only 33 minutes. I was eager for more and when viewed on TV it seemed longer.All in all, though, a treat for young and old."
1,This 3D does NOT work on 3D TV's with shutter glasses,"Amazon needs to get its act together on how it lists the ""3D"" DVDs! I purchased two IMAX large format 3D DVDs, and they don't work on my Samsung 3D TV with a Blu-Ray 3D DVD player.Amazon needs to use the words ""shutter glasses"" to indicate the 3D DVDs that will actually work on the new TVs. 2011 is supposed to be a big year for 3D TV. Hopefully Netflix will do a better job than Amazon in how it lists their 3D DVDs.This is not rocket science!!!The seller did a great job and I received the movies very quickly. Until Amazon can do a better job labeling the 3D DVDs, they are wasting everyone's time and effort.Not a happy camper. I will be sending the DVDs back."
2,Poor 3D,"Very poor 3D,not what I expected. Didn't work on my 3D TV set up. Works on 2D with the old fashion type glasses. It wasn't good quality, did not watch the entire video."
1,dated technology,This is an old 3D technology and is very dated. It is not compatable with the new 3D TV's that are out.
2,alien adventure is a misadventure,i got this 3d because of some of the reviews i read. i am very disappointed in this. i have tried every kind of 3d ways to play it and it still is not right. i can not get it to play right with any form of 3d glasses i have.
4,nice and effective,"my mom keeps complaining of pain that effect her work from time to another, after using Bengay relieving patches pain disappears completely its really good and effective product that my self recommend every one to use it"
2,Just buy Bengay in the tube,"These do not heat up in any way. They are just Bengay on a sticky patch. The patch does not stick well, and easily gets tangled on itself and your clothing during application."
1,Smells and is ineffective,"I'm definatly not impressed. The stripts have the texture of a really thin slab of gel shoe inserts and smell of cough drops which is just nasty. It's stays slimy, cool, uncomforable and will actually slide around (I had one on my neck). If you think you'd get relief by putting a cool, cough-drop smelling, jelly fish on your sore muscle give it a try otherwise, pass this one by."
5,Relief!,"My spine is fused from T3 to L2 and needless to say, I have a lot of back pain and discomfort. I have tried every patch out there and the Ben Gay patches are by far the best. No, they don't heat up! They aren't supposed to! What they do offer is a nice numbing sensation, muscle relaxation, and RELIEF! They are cold when you put them on, that's for sure. My husband laughs at the way I squirm when he's about to put one on for me - but once they are one, ahhhhhh.... I have NEVER had a problem with them staying put. I have a physically active job and often get a little sweaty while working - and they stay put! In fact, sometimes getting them off is the problem! (do it quickly, like a band-aid!) I have nothing but good things to say about these patches and believe me, I know pain. These are the only patches I will even bother using!"
1,very disappointed in the patch,Bought this for lower back pain...it didn't even get hot. A waste of money. Will never waste money on this again.
2,Not the original 50's releases!,"Avoid this like the plague! Little Richard, one of the greatest pioneers of early rock 'n roll, is not properly represented here. These versions were recorded by Richard in the early 60's and are completely inferior to his stellar 1950's recordings. Let's take ""The Girl Can't Help It,"" one of the greatest rock songs sung by anybody, anywhere. The original 1956 version is a superlative record, infectious, fun and nearly perfect. This VeeJay 1964 version stinks up the joint.An appreciation of Little Richard is essential in understanding rock 'n roll. His influence on the Beatles is particularly important. Don't shortcharge yourself by wasting money on this collection, seek out Richard's Speciality Sides, available ... and he'll knock your socks off."
4,Good,"This book was good. It kind of tears at your emotions, but that only makes it more enjoyable. Once again, the dolphins always, and I mean ALWAYS being super-friendly to Jody as if they were aquatic humans can be quite annoying. After all, wouldn't mistreated captive dolphins be frightened and a little bit tense around humans? And Jody's love of dolphins can be eye-rollingly sickening as well. I mean, it's not like she just really loves them or something, she's practically OBSESSED! She cries every time something bad happens to a dolphin, and passes up fun activities just so that she can SEE them. But although those things can be bothersome, I still enjoyed this book. All of the characters had their time to shine in this book, or so it seemed, and the story, although difficult to imagine in some parts, was interesting and even kind of absorbing. I recommend this series to dolphin lovers, and girls who like unique and entertaining books."
4,Dolphin Diaries - Review 1,This makes a great gift for pre-teens. The level of readability is easy and the subject interesting.The shipping was very quick (faster than indicated) and made it on time for a birthday surprise.
4,Another good choice,Lots of twists and turns in this one! Very surprising and enjoyable. A little different than her other books. Bravo.
2,Skip this one,"Another example of a decent author who is cranking out too many books too quickly. Her books are light, but they are typically fun and have likable characters worth rooting for. Not this one. Blah."
3,This appears to be a reissue.,"I'm very disappointed to report that this seems to be a reissue of The Tennis Party. I read it years ago and it was a pretty good book, but I don't want to purchase it again! The reviews for both 40 Love and The Tennis Party discuss the main characters Patrick and Caroline Chance, and their residence White House. I doubt I'm putting 2+2 together and getting anything other than 4!"
2,Disappointing drivel from generally fun author,"I am a Wickham/Kinsella fan and was very disappointed by this book. Agree with other reviewers - it is not new but a re-issue of The Tennis Party and not nearly as good as some of her more recent work like Remember Me. I expected light and fun with some good laughs thrown in, but this one was just tedious and boring without redemption for anyone at the end - they are all unhappier than when it started. Not what I hope for from my chick lit brain candy! I would not waste my time if I were you."
1,Skip,"This is by far the worst book by this author I have read - I never give up in the middle of Wickham's books, but this one is a dud. Pass!"
1,Wish I hadn't read it,"I usually enjoy Kinsella/Wickham's novels. I'm relieved to learn from other reviewers that this is just a reissue of her first novel, as otherwise I would be wondering what in the world happened to her writing. Unlikeable characters(with the exception of Stephen, Annie, Georgina and Nicola), filthy language (how many times can you say the ""F"" word in one sentence), interminable blow-by-blow descriptions of tennis games, and a depressing ending. Thumbs down."
1,Depressing,That about sums it up. It's depressing and tedious to read. I dont know why authors feel the need to show they have great talent by writing about the misery and painful challenges of everyday life. We all deal with with those kinds of things in our own lives and I for one read to escape them.
3,Just okay...not her best work,"I've read most of Madeleine Wickham/Sophie Kinsella's books and usually love them. I was not thrilled with this one. It was okay, but as an avid fan of her other writing, this one was a disappointment. It was a fast, easy read, as most of her books are. However, the ending left me cold and unsatisfied. If you've read her other books, this one will not be your favorite. I didn't hate it, but I wouldn't read it again. Kinda wishing I had bought it in regular form rather than on my Kindle so I could sell it back."
3,Not on the same par as the other Wickham/Kinsella books,"To me, when I pick up a book by Wickham/Kinsella, what I'm both anticipating and looking for is her wonderful wit. She's turned characters that, in other author's hands would have been unbearable, and made them downright endearing. But this novel, that apparently is a reissue of her first, lacks that special charm. There were no characters among the 8 main players who I felt any feeling for other than ambivalence. Will I continue to read Madeline/Sophie's other novels? Absolutely, because with time she has become more and more polished, with a unique talent for charming and sincere characterizations. These were perhaps, her training wheels. It's certainly more than readable, just not what I've come to expect from this author."
3,The Darcy's On The Outsiees,"This is not for die hard Jane Austen fan,or maybe even jut a mild admirers. I enjoyed the book to the degree that it was very real in a sense. Sometimes now matter how hard you root for a couple they just don't make it. I could live without some parts but it is just one person's outlook and when you compare this with some of the other sappy sequels(I have read 14 so far) it is better than some and worst than others. I would softly reccomend it"
1,...wipe off the bad taste...,"I love P&P and while I am realistic enough to know that no one can write like Jane Austen. However, in the spirit of Austen and having read that Elizabeth was a favorite of hers I would think that better things were in store for the Darcys.This book was so repulsive and disgusting I couldn't even look at it! I could barely finish it. I had to read the original a few times to get myself back on track.Think of it this way, The Bar Sinister and Presumption were better and that's saying a good bit. I am following my conscience and the opinions of other readers---I am staying away from Emma Tennant!"
1,"better than Pemberly, but still lacking","_Pemberley_, this author's first pseudo-sequal to _Pride and Prejudice_, was a shamefully bad book, and a horrid disappointment to Jane Austen fans.This author's second try is a bit better, and the Austen fan will probably be able to go five chapters or so before putting the book down in distaste.While it's slightly more polished, it's still an abominable mishandling of the characters found in the original _Pride and Prejudice_.I recommend passing on this book. Austen was an artist. This author is not."
1,This is *not* a P&P sequel in any real sense of the word!,"I read this book as a teenager, and it put me off sequels for a *long* time!Jane Austen was undoubtedly a master at her craft and a hard act to follow, however that doesn't appear to be the issue here.It is *not* a sequel to P&P.; The characters bear no resemblance (except in name) to those in P&P.; Jane Austen has many (underlying) fascinating themes in P&P;, and not a single one is believably taken up by this sequel (okay, maybe I'm prejudiced - no pun intended - but...). I agree with those who call it a soap-opera. It might be an analysis of the ups and downs of marriage, but why the Darcys were picked is beyond me, as almost all facets of their P&P; personalities appear ignored in this book. This sequel might just as easily be based on any other fictional couple.It will not please die-hard P&P; or Austen fans, and it will certainly not please anyone looking for a sequel that has a sense of continuation from the original."
1,HORRID,This book is an atrocity! It takes the beloved characters from P&P and twists them so badly you don't even recognize them. Elizabeth seems meek and cowardly...not like her true sprited character at all. Jane is the one in this book that shows great character and has the great marriage with Bingley. I enjoyed Mr Darcy Takes A Wife MUCH MUCH more.
3,Laura mercier eye liner,Color perfect but difficult to find the right amt of liquid to make it apply properly. Cheaper brands seem to apply with just a little dab of moisture on brush. Don't think I'll get it again.
1,Very Disappointing CD Set,I was so disappointed in this CD Set. I had really looked forward to receiving this set because of the great song titles and great artists only to play them and find out that almost all of the tracks were live recordings and not very good quality at that. They sounded as if they were recorded in some bar room. I would definitly NOT recommend this CD Set to anyone.
5,Amazing!,This is Great!! I love itit was complicated first... but now i know how to use it and I just love it...
4,It's useful for people who want to learn total synthesis,It teaches you general methods and logic of organic synthesis. There are a lot of example about total synthesis.
4,Killer machine - but watch out for wobbled frame!,"Love this machine. Small, fast, ultrapotable.Unfortunately, I had to turn it in for repair, as the alu case was bend, causing the machine to be rockin' back and forth when placed on a desk, only supported by three rubber feets. Very annoying!This seems to a be a serious design flaw, as many users have reported this problem on various websites.A lot of users have also reported problems with batterylids that are misaligned with the bottom, so they ""stick out"" with up to several milimeters.So if you pick it up at a store, be sure to check, whether its stands firmly on all four feets, and check the batterylid!But besides from that, it's a fantastic machine for anything but gaming, due to it's rather mediocre nVidia graphics card."
3,How hot can it get?,"A new 12 inch laptop, what a cool idea for an Apple computer lover. This new computer was stylish, wonderfully made, loaded with a superdrive, and a great ATA Hard Drive, it torched the competion....and myself.Once this baby is working for 8-15 minutes, you begin to feel your lap getting quite hot. After 15 the pain is unbearable and one must place a pillow to prevent the heat from burning through your legs. Finally even your hands get very hot from typing, at which point one must hook up a keyboard + mouse and put it on your desk.Waaaala! a 12 inch desktop. Suddenly size DOES matter"
4,angel wisdom,I purchased my first book of Angel Wisdom at a second hand store and liked it so much I then purchased another from Amazon for a friend. It is full of wise insight that concerns humans of today.I read it everyday as part of my daily readings. I would recommend it for any age.
4,Works as advertized,"Worked great on my jeep to keep the doors from banging into the sides of the carport. I'm giving it 4 starts only because they were kinda long for my Jeep ('97 Wrangler). At the longest setting, I could swing the door almost all the way around. But I suppose I could always cut them and burn the ends to keep it from fraying. Great product!"
5,Fuerte y seguro,Producto muy bueno y bien elaborado. Sus costuras son fuertes y el material con el que esta fabricado también .Muy recomendado para jeep 2005 Rubicon .
5,Door straps,"When I bought my wrangler, it had straps on it, but they let the doors swing all the way out and I knew that I and anyone who opened the doors would forget to hold onto them so I immediately started looking for some that were adjustable. I bought these and put them on right away. Took about 10 minutes to change both only because the screws on my doors hadn't been taken out in a while so they were a little tricky to get on. Three months later, I don't see any wear or anything. Cheap and good quality!"
5,Durable and Dependable,"The door strap on my Jeep Wrangler snapped from a large gust of wind. I purchased these a few days ago and just received them in the mail Great quality, and very durable fabric. I don't think the wind will be snapping these new straps!"
4,Durable,These straps are better than the stock ones so far. A lot more slots for how far the door opens. The stock straps let the door open to a 90 degree angle which will let your door hit the car next to you when parked.
5,Does what it should -,"Bought these for my 1997 Wrangler after I purchased it and found that it didn't come with any door straps. This caused a problem in parking lots and gas stations. The door would swing wide open, hitting anything in its way. I installed the straps (I say installed but they just slide on the posts) and the doors still opened a little too wide for my liking. No problem - I just removed one end from the post and twisted the strap a few times until it became the length I want. Sturdy straps that do what they say at a great price."
5,The best stuff about Citrix out there,"In my opinion, this book is the ONLY interesting published book about Citrix until now. I have read most of the available books about Citrix and Terminal Services and this is the only one I would buy again.If you are a Citrix Certified Administrator, you will find this book very helpful. Personally speaking, I prefer it to most of the Citrix official documentation.Take into account that it is a book for people who already has a deep knowledge about Citrix. It is not a guide for begginers. It gives you hints to improve your own Citrix project methodology.Amazon guys, let me suggest this, please: If you are looking for a step-by-step begginers guide, have a look at Methodology in a Box (freely available at http://www.dabcc.com)"
5,Exactly what we wanted,"We purchased this book based on the great reviews and it didn't disappoint. The details are accuate and helpful, often moreso than the signage on the trails. One of the more memorable hints was to take a short side trip up a hillside on the Fairy Falls trail to view the Grand Prismatic Spring. We certainly had a much better view than those standing right on top of it on the boardwalks, especially with the sun shining. Bravo Andrew!"
5,Super Quick Shipping!!,"This was shipped very quickly!!! It's a gift for my hubby for x-mas, so we haven't viewed it yet. However he specifically asked for it. So I'm excited to see it as we both LOVE Yellowstone!!"
1,Digital Version - Map detail can't be read,I bought the digital version to get it on our kindle and the image quality of the maps is so bad I can't read them. This is primarily what I was interested in so I would not recommend purchasing the digital version. If anyone knows how to get you money back on digital content so I can buy the real book that would help.
5,Top Trails Yellowstone & Grand Teton National Parks: Must-Do Hikes for Everyone (Top Trails),very helpful
2,A good book but not so helpful,This book is good but with other map books and gps map details it was not needed.
4,"""The acid test for those who insist that they are born again","This is quite a different interpretation of the New Testament book of John, but it is, perhaps, one of the most accurate, none the less. How do I know this? Because the book describes the experience of the person recieving the spirit far better than the traditional translations do. Those of you who have been there will know what I'm on about."
3,Terrible Service,"The strap I ordered was great. It was everything advertised. It works well and is fully adjustable even for large men. The service from the vendor (not Amazon)was terrible. I paid extra for expedited service and not only did I not get it quickly, the shipment took longer than even normal freight. Would definitely not order form that vendor again."
3,"Product delivered on time, but was fragile and broke easily","Product received in timely manner.The power connector was unclipped from the circuit board.When I went to reclip, the power connector broke from the circuit board.I ordered another one of these from another company that was better packedand didn't have any problems."
3,Organic Fruit Review,"This fruit would be fine if it were not for the soft slimey textured watermelon and some other fruit that is in this can that is just slimey and icky. There are certain fruit that shouldn't be canned, and otherwise the crunchy pieces are fine. Much of the soft fruit I had to discard. Albeit, this item is good frozen and added to other fruit to make smoothie's then you don't have to taste the slime."
4,Like the subject matter,"I just finished the third book in this series; I learn about interesting subjects: transplants, genetic modifications, how to ""cull"" a rat along with people with depth and history. They're fast reads with a little too much detail sometimes. Love the link to ""Sci Med"" who provide so many interesting details and background for our inspector. What a great job he has. And, yes, there is suspense and mystery!"
1,Deception,I did not like the book. I could not even keep reading it. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
3,Solar Eclipse?,"I am not really satisfied with this product...I thought I would get a total ""eclipse"" of the sun, but I was wrong.- It's blocks out the sun, but not completely.- This product does a mediocre job at what it's supposed to do, and it'snot really fashionable.- The frame was made in China seems sturdy enough, but there are foam padson either side of the ear pieces that don't like to stay on.- These frames are made for girls with really wide faces.- The only reason I didn't give this a worse rating is because the actuallenses on the sunglasses are nice."
3,Too simplistic,"I found this book to be too simplistic. The information is accurate but weak on ways to correct the problem. As a psychologist who treats anxiety and hyperventilation, I guess I was expecting too much. I always hope for some new technique or way of explaining things that will be useful with clients, or even a book I would recommend to clients. About the only thing I found potentially useful were the workbook forms at the end of the book.This book might be helpful to someone with almost no knowledge of hyperventilation. But then the person would probably be much better of in treatment with a knowledgeable biofeedback therapist or anxiety specialist. Also, the author's emphasis on physical therapists as breathing experts is peculiar to New Zealand. PTs in the US would not be my first choice to treat hyperventilation or anxiety. I'd look for a mental health or biofeedback professional with experience in treating anxiety and hyperventilation."
3,Not up to Lisa Scottalina's usual suspense,"Book was good, however too long and characters became confusing. This is a book you can lay down where others were page turners. Story is good but could be condensed to make it more readable."
4,One of Scottoline's best,"This courtroom drama features Bennie Rosato, the head of an all-female law firm. Bennie agrees to take on a murder case for a woman named Alice Connolly who is accused of killing her detective boyfriend, but who claims that she's been framed by the police. The most interesting part of the book centers around Alice's startling resemblance to Bennie and her assertion that she is Bennie's twin. Author Scottoline spins out the suspense throughout the book. Is Bennie truly Alice's twin or is Alice merely using a ploy to get Bennie to defend her? In this book the reader meets Bennie's ill mother and her absentee father, and Bennie examines what family really means. This is a fascinating story with lots of twists and turns which kept me guessing up to the last page."
3,Legalese on Display,"Scottoline has written a fast-paced legal thriller, complete with plenty of lawyerly posturing. Good plot and pacing, with well-developed characters makes for an entertaing read. My only complaint is that there were too many loose ends and unanswered questions in the story (but that kind of story device seems to be so in vogue these days)."
4,Lisa knows her law,"Sometimes these ""legal thrillers"" are so thin and shaky on the realities of legal practice that I want to pitch them after the first courtroom scene. Not Lisa Scottoline's. She serves up accurate legal details and spins a good yarn to boot. I've read FINAL APPEAL and ROUGH JUSTICE along with this one. Bennie Rosato's law firm is a place where lots of female attorneys might like to work--all women all the time. The male characters, though, are not macho dogs, thank heaven. Just when you think you see a stereotype coming, you may be surprised. MISTAKEN IDENTITY is not my favorite, since a couple of the plot twists are a bit much. But if you are willing to put strict logic on the shelf for a while, take a trip with these characters and you will enjoy the ride, I promise."
4,Mistaken Identity,"Rosato & Associates were fun to follow once again. The plot was intricate and kept me interested. There were not as many laughs as usual, but the story was fast moving so I enjoyed the read."
1,Fought to turn each page and finish,"Im a huge fan and have read all her other books, but am sorry I bought this one. As others have said, unbelievable & un engaging. What attorney with only a week to prepare a capital murder case pulls an all nighter opening boxes and setting up the victim's apartment? Definitely not up to par with her other books. Bring back the detectives and characters of your earlier books, Lisa!"
2,I love Phila,"How I wish the characterizations were better. Bennie is unbelievable as a lawyer taking one week to prepare a case for murder that happened one year ago. Her boy friend is unbelievably blah...its unbelievable that Beanie cut her hair with a nail sissors and it looks cute...Mary is unbelievably terrified by a murder that happened one year ago...Its all unbelievable and Bennie seems foolish and inane to the nth degree...and I never found out why the Judge was also a crook...was he greatly enriched??? Lou Jacobs rings true as does Judy the associate from CA. How about Scotoline kills Bennie (how about calling her Beanie?) and promotes Judy to top dog. Or just incapacitates Beanie, like put her in the hospital. yeah."
2,"This book was not ""all that""","I was dissapointed with this book. It seemed very drawn out and because of this you wound up forgetting who the characters were. There were too many names, characters, etc. to keep track of. On the positive side, the dialog and writing was fun to read..."
1,"Yes, 'Girls Rule', but not in the manner presented!","You must love the smartly dressed receptionist in Bennie's 'all girl' firm? No, it was a fashion house, there were enough clothing descriptions through the book for me to deem it that. This is the first Lisa Scottoline novel I've read and it's, well, readable? The climax of the book was so unbelievable, Ford Exporer climbing steps? Give your head a shake. I cared nothing for the characters at that point either. Time to read a Pulitzer prize winner, perhaps a Nobel,or a Booker because I know this author's coming back with her identical twin...what will she be wearing?"
3,Writes great dialogue but needs work on plot,"This book is easy to read but there are too many holes in the plot. Also, the ending was just tacked on leaving unanswered questions... a sequel is in the works I'm sure. This was the first book I read by this author and was especially interested because I work in Philadelphia and know the two female lawyers that she acknowledges. I'll give her next book another chance but this is only a 3-star book in my humble opinion."
4,Crackling legal thriller,"Scottoline has written an excellent, ""can't put it down"" thriller, featuring her sometime heroine, Bennie Rosato (Scottoline has a revolving cast of characters who take center stage in each novel)When a woman on trial for murder tells lawyer Bennie Rosato that she is her identical twin, the mystery, suspense and action are only beginning.Scottoline has a great sense of dialague and character, and I enjoyed this novel a lot. She just may be better than Grisham.Also recommended: Rough Justice."
3,A good read,"Bennie has been better!! But then, a bad Bennie is worth a thousand lesser characters. Scottoline's writing is, as always, superb and she keeps the reader involved in the story. However, the plot line meanders somewhat and the interest flags toward the middle of the book. The ending is almost too pat, but you tend to overlook that as you race to the finish. All in all a satisfying Scottoline effort, if not the best.http://members.ebay.com/aboutme/tiannei/"
2,Female John Grisham she isn't!,"This could be an enjoyable book if the language could be cleaned up somewhat. There are too many loose ends left dangling at the end of the book. Much too long for the content. I have read most of the other reviews & I agree that it isn't a total waste of time, but she is not a female John Grisham."
4,She's right up there with Turow and Grisham.,This book kept my interest from beginning to end. It seemed implausible to me that twins would not be known to each other but this was explained satisfactorily by the author. Scottoline is very talented. She gives her characters life and believability. I look forward to reading her prior works as well as future novels.
1,......yawn,"I read about 100 pages of this book and the last 50 or so were a struggle. I was so bored with this book that I gave up on it. I didn't particularly like any of these characters, and the story was very slow-moving."
1,TOO MANY LOOSE ENDS,"I have read many of Lisa's books and I loved them. This one I DID not like. It took about 200 pages to even GET interesting. I will admit that the last half of the book kept me very engrossed, but when the book ended I was left with that feeling of... WHAT????The ending was a twist and very shocking, but too many loose ends were not cleared up.POSSIBLE SPOILERS*****what happened to connoly at the end? there was never a mention of if she was alive or not?how did the plastic bag end up in the dumpster?why did lenihan try and kill bennie? citrone? what was his deal?if the cops had nothing to do with the murder what was the problem?what happened to the judge? i mean i know he sailed off in the end but why did he get involved in the first place?some of these questions may have answers I am missing but I wish I knew the answers. in fact if anyone does please contact me here!"
4,Great read,"I am a big fan of Lisa Scottoline, and this book did not disappoint. It has the intrigue and suspense of all her other books. If you haven't read this author before I would highly recommend any of her books."
1,Textbook hackwork,"The only people who might gain from reading this book are those interested in the publishing industry and analysis of the minimal requirements for publishing thrillers. ""Mistaken Identity"" will show that those elements do not include the following:1. Correct English grammar2. Correct usage3. Interesting characters4. Believable situations5. Believable behavior6. Greater-than-one-dimensional characterization7. A grasp of non-standard or non-prestige English8. An ability to allow the reader to trust the author's depictions of professional behaviorThe only manifest requirements are (a) the ability to mix stereotypic characters in soap-operatic situations with (b) a ""mystery"" that simply operates by witholding explanation until the end of the book."
2,"Mistaken identity, Scottoline is not Grisham","Have you ever read a Grisham legal-thriller ?. In my opinion Mr. Grisham has provided an involuntary strong influence on Lisa Scottoline, this book looks like a copycat but cannot attain the level of the former writer. With a quick pace marked by short chapters and with a poor language improper for a legal-thriller, the author is determined to trap the reader into the plot and scores, because as the pages go by, she learns how to exploit the story setting the mystery out and then turning it into tight suspense which snowballs toward the last chapters, but when you finish the book and look at it as a whole in retrospect, it is easy to perceive loose ends during the course of the events as the author falls sometimes in traps set by her own creative ideas, leaving some important situations unresolved or sidestepped, this go hand to hand with the flabby character drawing and shows a definitive poor writing style."
2,Interesting plot but disappointing methods.,"I became very interested in this book when I read the first two chapters in a promotional. The plot about the lawyer finding a heretofore unknown twin sister in jail was engaging and the initial writing caught my interest. HOWEVER, when I finally got to read the book itself, I couldn't stomach it. What bothers me the most is the massive amount of profanity used by the characters. Call me naive, (although after 20 years in the military, I can't say that I am) but I didn't know that any literature that was considered fit to be sold to the general public had so much bad language in it. Also, it's important to me in a book to be able to like at least some of the main characters, and by that I mean that they should have some admirable character traits, or at the least, engaging personalities. I have to admit that I've skimmed the sections with the worst language, which is much of the book, but I haven't found anyone likeable yet. I'd skip on this one!"
4,At Home Between The Wars,"Robert Newton and Celia Johnson star as the parents of the Gibbons family in this episodic David Lean film that charts the history of the family between the two World Wars. It tells the story of homefront re-adjustment following WWI, the family conflicts that arise as social and political pressures mount, and it demonstrates the need for solidarity and courage in the face of the imminent war. As always with a David Lean film, the British cast is exceptionally strong, with a notable performance by Celia Johnson. Although the story is slow in parts, the changes in the family as reflected by the events around them nonetheless maintains the viewer's attention. During the 1940's, Lean had an impressive record of quality films, and this certainly belongs on that list."
4,A boost for the War effort,"Noel Coward and David Lean made several pictures together during WWII as a way of boosting the morale in Britain. The most famous is probably ""Brief Encounter"" and the most war themed is ""In Which We Serve"", but ""This Happy Breed"" is the homefront movie. It follows the life of one family from before the war to ""the present."" The men who go away to war aren't followed it's their loved ones at home. Great Britain went through far more during World War II than the United States, rationing started earlier, lasted longer, and was more severe there. They were under constant bombardment and as many civilians died as military men. This film brings it all home. By today's standards the pacing is a little slow, but it's a good movie and an interesting historical document. John Mills plays a young sailor and his daughter Juliet made her screen debut as the baby."
4,Good lower-priced rowing machine,"I've used this rowing machine for the past 5 months (114 miles) and have not had a problem with it. It provides a good, convenient workout in comfort of my living room. Obviously, there are more expensive machines out there but this one does the job for me.February 2007 update: I've rowed 288 miles on this machine since May 2005, and it still works fine. My only minor complaint is that it can be slightly noisy."
2,Not for rowers,"I'm a competative collegiate rower, I got this erg in order to keep in shape over semester break. The noise and the difficult assembly didn't bother me. The two main problems with this machine are the lenght and the monitor. At 6' I'm not very tall for a rower and I'm not getting anything close to full extension, I'm barely half an inch away from the end of the slide on my drive and I can't pull the handle all the way in, and when I come up to the catch I can still stretch my arms almost past the fan assembly. The monitor displays distances in miles and speed in mph instead on meters and 500m split, making it extremely difficult to keep track of my performance. The seat is less comfortable the solid plastic seats in shells and the concept 2. In sumation this machine is fine for the casual rower, but not for anyone seriously invloved in the sport."
4,Pretty Good Value,"Easy assembly (4 bolts) and simple adjustment. Good action, but a tad easy on the resistance. Overall good value. Two complaints - sensor wire can cut out on speed and distance, and speed and distance should be in meters, not miles."
4,Best new Lego Series,Superbly playable. My son takes it wherever he goes. Great for kids who love cars. You can hear the kids simulating the roar of the engines and the screech of the tires.
5,I love the music and songs on here!,"I have the cassette of this. But the cassette is gone bad, so as soon as amazon.com gets the cd I will surely be purchasing it. George Jones does a wonderful job with these gospel songs. I love all the songs on it. Everyone ought to have this in their cd collection!"
1,very disappointing and a complete bomb,"These tracks are old, old, old. It sounds like they were recorded in somebody's basement. On one track George sounds like he's been inhaling helium. Definately not worth the price [...]."
3,"OK, but I really wanted more detail","A lot of minor (and thus interesting) roads are left off this road atlas of Europe. I am just certain that none of the roads on the map of Western Ireland, for example, at all resemble the ittybitty single-lane road I took to get to the ferry across the Shannon Estuary. Likewise I don't see any of the more interesting small roads we used to putter around Argyll in western Scotland. Nor that funky little pathlet we used to drive to Monterosso on the coast of Tuscany.I was also expecting small maps of major cities to appear in the corners of country-maps, in the way they do for state-maps in the U.S. Too bad for you if you want to get through Paris in a car - now you don't even have a map to do it with.If you want to stay on main highways, and if you plan on staying away from cities, you probably won't get lost, but truly you are better off buying more detailed maps of individual countries or regions than this."
2,Children's literature,"I really like this author, she wrote a great book about training paraprofessionals, but I fear she has missed the mark with this book. The overall message is a good one, and the teacher in the book is obviously well intentioned; however, I found the illustrations to be, in truth, a bit creepy. I guess it could work as a read aloud with some rich classroom discussion but I would never just put it into my classroom library for kids to discover on their own. The main character with autism seems too stereotypical to me and kids in the class get angry with him which is never a good thing! There are better books on this subject out there."
3,Good content - pictures are not clear and not easy read for a child.,"Good book overall, except the illustrations on this book make it a difficult read for children who actually have these difficulties.Using real life photos and images are much better as it is difficult for these kids to decipher meaning from the photos if they are too abstract."
2,"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 26","A curiosity shot by John Huston in Ireland where he lived at that time. It's a harmless movie that will please the fans ofAnnie (Special Anniversary Edition), another John Huston film bought by completists only. Beautiful landscapes, John Hurt in one of his first films, nice production design. Already forgotten."
1,missing gingerbread man,"Although I expected some damage to an old book, it is made quite useless by the lack of the main character, the little cardboard gingerbread man. I would not have bought it if I had known."
4,Great Griddle!,This griddle heats up fast and is very easy to cleanup. There was noticeable heat unevenness with pancakes. Not able to comment about dishwasher use.
4,Love the titanium line,I love the Anolon Titanium line. It heats up well and does what it's supposed to do. The best part is it's easy to clean! My one minor disappointment is that the handles on this griddle get extremely hot.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!!,"Don't get me wrong, this is great music, but part of the review must also be on the quality of the particular purchase (if it is universal). In other words, take up cracks and skuffs with Amazon or the sender. But in this case the MP3 has skips on it. This will be true for anyone who purchases it. I am unsure of the quality of the import CD. I do not think the quality of the originals are in this bad of shape, but am unaware. If so, I will retract and take out my review. But I would purchase Darby & Tarlton from another source (as in don't purchase this particular album). Don't make the same mistake I did. I would welcome respectful comments if others had better luck than I."
3,Hottest Matches?,"An all-together decent collection of matches featuring British Bulldog taking on Mr. Perfect, Bret Hart and ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage both respectively taking on IRS, and a six-man tag team match where Roddy Piper & The Bushwackers face The Mountie & The Nasty Boys. Not exactly the ""hottest matches"" but still better than most of the garbage they show on today's ""World Wrestling Entertainment""."
1,Beam and Read reading light,This was one of the most disappointing purchases I have ever made. I was excited at first because I do a lot of counted cross-stitch. After using it for 2 weeks the light burned out and the strap fell apart.
4,Nice to keep rain out,As others have noted they do not fit perfectly but they do fit. I did not have to trim them or add additional tape as others have indicated. There is one small spot on the leading edge of the front visors that have a little tape showing but it is not too bad. I have had AVS brand visors on several other vehicles and they all seem to have similar issues with fitment. I have also used a different brand (Lund) and had very similar problems so it is not limited to just the AVS brand. It is nice to have the window lowered at a stop sign with the windshield wipers on and not have water pour into the truck!
3,It works well.. fit and finish.. yeah about that.,"Listen they work. Its great being able to crack the windows and not worry about rain/snow coming in.However, it seems that the product is being made a lot cheaper. The taped points where no where near the locations they should have been. I had to use extra tape and also use a Black sharpee to color over the tape so it didn't look so bad in points it wasnt sticking to anything.If you dont mind ""making them work"" and you get them for a deal. Go for it. Dont pay full price since you will need to adapt them to your vehicle."
1,Very Disappointed in Centon,"I bought one of these flash drives at CompUSA a few months ago. The first time I used it, I was trying to move a file from one computer to another. I was able to save the file onto the flash drive, but when I plugged it into the second computer the drive must have fried itself because it did not work and has not worked since. I called Centon's customer support and had to leave a message. I got a message back that they had opened an incident report for me and to call back for resolution. I have called numerous times since and never get to speak with a live person, and they have not returned a single call. At this point I've had it with them and just want to warn others to beware of this brand."
5,Bam Kicks Ass!,Viva La Bam is the best TV show ever! this 3 disc set has everything and even secret deleted scenes. This DVD kept me occupied for hours and i watched it over and over again i HIGHLY RECOMEND VIVA LA BAM to anybody whoes cool enough and not a poser!
3,why?,does anyone other tham myself remember when music television (Mtv for all the posers out there) played music?
1,NOT WORTH A $0.01,El Chapulin Colorado has better effects and sound than this movie! The only good thing about this movie is the cover.
4,not the best version,The CRD version boxset is preferred. Brilliant Classics's The Masterworks has no documentation and there are a few inferior recordings.ASIN: B00069PE2O to find the CRD version.
4,Very informative,"The title explains the book well. Each chapter deals with how to cope with different situations in life. Pulling from the three books mentioned in the title and a couple of other books it tells the reader how to deal with tragedy, but also normal, everyday life.The book was easy to read and very informative. My only complaint would be the tiny print. It made reading the book difficult if done for more than a few minutes. Otherwise this is definitely a book I would recommend reading.I received this book free of charge from WIPF in exchange for my honest review."
5,"More than just the voice for the ""Untouchables.""","Although most of us remember Walter Winchell fo rhis rapid-fire narration for the old ""Untouchables"" television show, he was much more than that. Neal Gabler chronicles Winchell's career and life, but it's his analysis of Winchell's affect on his times and culture that makes this book transcend routine biography. Winchell's became a powerful voice for a time: businessmen wanted to be his friend, celebrities needed him, and politicians feared him. In fact, most people feared him. But somehow, Winchell created a definition of celebrity that has endured even today. Although he may be forgetton in our conscious memories, Winchell still looms large in our cultural memory. This is a stunning biography of a man who fought hard to get it all and fought equally hard to keep his fame and recognition as lost it in a blaze of self-destructiveness. One of the best books I've read in years."
3,Interesting to learn about that time in society.,"It is fascinating to learn about that time in our history. It's a bit wordy, perhaps, and is taking me a little longer to get through it, than it usually does."
4,fascinating person,"This book is an interesting study of a inordinately power driven and self-destructive person in the world of celebrities, suggesting valid psychological insights in the process. I found the parallels and actual connections with J. Edgar Hoover particularly interesting. The material also sheds a thorough and engrossing light on a unigue era of American social history, weaving in many other interesting ""characters"" in addition to WW - overall, a satisfying and worthwhile read."
2,Signifying Nothing,"Too many words to make an inconsequential man important. Very few Americans paid that much attention to his rantings, no matter what the author maintains. The world was more intensely involved with war and its aftermath to bother with a gossip columnist."
1,This Book Is A Joke,"He says that there are many contradictions in the Bible which cause it to be unreliable. The two examples he gives though, are his own faulty reading. He says that one gospel states that Jesus was crucified on the ""Day of Preparation of Passover"" and another says he was crucified on the Passover. However, if he knew what he was talking about he'd know the Preparation Day was for the Sabbath, and that meant it was the Preparation Day of Passover week. They were the same thing. His other example was time differences between two gospels, but one gospel used Roman time and the other Jewish time. You'd think someone who is such a ""learned"" professor would understand. But since his two examples of why you should trust him and not the Bible are inaccurate, it follows that the rest of his thesis is inaccurate.Plus, how do you trust someone who states that you can't trust the Bible because it's inaccurate, then uses the Bible to make his own thesis?"
4,An Honest Atheist Looks for the Historical Jesus,"Ehrman has produced an entertaining and informative book, filled with wit, scholarship, and stimulating ideas. No one will read this book without learning something valuable. If the picture of Jesus he paints seems embarrassingly small to believers, that is only because he has adopted the controversial Criterion of Dissimilarity as one of his primary methodological principles and because he is a self-proclaimed atheist. To see what picture a radical theologian paints read Albert Schweitzer's books. Start with his Mystery of the Kingdom of God, rather than Quest of the Historical Jesus recommended by Ehrman."
3,This book is both needed and not needed,"This book rehashes the thesis that Jesus was first and formost an apocalyptic prophet, a very reasonable conclusion to draw from centuries of scholarship and a close reading of the bible. However there is no reason to believe that this book will be any more persuasive than many others in the past in convincing people of something they do not wish to be convinced of. Granted Ehrman has a writing style which could appeal to a general audience but the bible thumpers who need to read this book wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole."
3,Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millenium,"Ehrman provides a compelling case for arguing that Jesus was truly and apocalyptic prophet, citing many sources and not just those included in the Bible."
4,A West Virginia Poet Little Known,"This is a beautiful book. I knew very little about this poet. She has a wisdom from years of living, years of reading, years of abiding with her native land and her feeling for nature. She made a statement about trees that just blew my mind. ""I love the trees. They seem to do what they are made to do very well."" I like her poems very much."
5,Life Launch,This is a great book. I recommend this book to anyone regardless if you are taking the class at Ashford University. This book has a few writings in it for being used. It is in great condition. Well worth the price!
5,LifeLaunch: A Passionate Guide to the Rest of Your Life,This is an excellent book for anyone who is about to begin their life of adulthood. It will open up your most inner thoughts and prepare you for different situations you may encounter in your life.
4,college book,I was well pleased with the time it took to process this book and have it at my doorstep!! Thanks again Mr. Mark Smith
5,LifeLaunch,"The book was purchased used, but looked almost brand new. It was shipped immediately and we were very impressed with the entire transaction."
1,Utter Nonsense,"I'm being forced to use this book for school. I am reading it and after getting most of the way through the book I have yet to find anything useful, uplifting, inspiring, helpful, informative, or intellectually stimulating. I truly want to find the value in this book, but I'm not succeeding at all. It's a painfully dull read by a couple of people who apparently do not have anything to offer."
3,Life Launch,"This item was purchased for a class which also required a second textbook. I found this book to be very interesting. Not sure if it was really needed for this class, however I thought it was okay and it does provide stories of others who have made changes in their lives which resulted in a better quality of life."
3,PSY book for Ashford,Good Condition of the book and Shipping time.. only issue i had with this book is that it smelled like smoke from a cigarette. It was hard reading from it since the smell was on every page
4,New as expected,I received the book about the time I expected to and it was in very good condition. I would purchase here again.
1,missing hardware,This product arrived with no hardware for assembling it. Until I receive the missing parts I can't actually judge the product. Unfortunately this makes my experience both disappointing and irritating!
4,movie review,Very realistic movie. Came quickly bad condition. Couldn't even get it out of the box. I had to use a knife to tear apart the case just to get to the movie.Then it was really blurry. But I did really like the movie.
3,Not for 2012,It didn't hold my students attention as I expected it would. I could've done without the screaming and odd music as well.
2,Slow Paced,"This slow paced and somewhat out dated movie regarding the Salem witch trials of 1692, the Towne family, and the tragic death of Rebecca Towne Nurse at Gallow's Hill moves at a snail's pace. The performances in it are mediocre at best. The only redeeming quality here is that if this is a story that contains any personal interest in it for you, you may then not be disappointed by the long adaptive and uninspiring screen play of an otherwise very interesting true story."
2,Would like to see the entire DVD,"The first and the third episodes in the movie were fine BUT the second episode was unviewable, could not understand anything being said and the picture was wavy and split up because of poor recording---constant break-up as if a storm was brewing is on our satellite during a movie. Very disappointed with this. I would have loved to see the entire movie. Sarah happens to be a distant relative of one of my neighbors so I have a deep interest in this film as well as the film itself."
1,"A terrible film, maybe accurate...","This movie hit me right from the beginning with spats of erratic music and bad child acting. Parts were somewhat interesting but the poor child acting hit home the disgust I felt for this movie. The scene at the beginning with the cart going through the snow was far too long and then the sudden flashback to the hangings was almost laughable instead of terrifying as it was supposed to be.Things got worse from there.I watched this in a history class and do not recommend it to anyone who has any love for the art of movies. Maybe it is historically accurate, but I'd rather have a better made film than a historically-correct film any day."
5,A new favorite,"Feral is a great thriller bound to give anyone a serious case of the creeps. I couldn't put it down. I even skipped a meal while reading it, and anyone that knows me would tell you that's saying something.Feral is the story of a Bogey Man that takes children, and murders parents. A child named Charity was taken by the Bogey Man, but had a chance to escape. She runs to a place called Feral Park, a playground that is home to more than meets the eye...Highly recommended for any fan of horror, or anyone that simply wants a good book to read. It just got added to my shelf of favorites."
5,glue it to a piece of wood,"If you're worried about it flexing glue it to a piece of wood. If you get the right thickness of wood you can match the height of the board to the height of a regular brick (ie: 3 flats high). I've got two of them expoxyed to the center of a 2' x 4' piece of MDF (~ $3 + epoxy) and it works great on the carpet. There's extra room around the plates for building or running cars on, etc."
2,Floppy disc,"Make sure there a handy man/woman in the home; your going to need MDF board ,glue ,and paint!This is because the baseplate is so flimsy, its like a thin piece of cardboard. Lego models ""pop off"" whenthe baseplate is carried.When we redesigned it the baseplate was fine."
4,A bit flimsy,"The big size is great. I would have expected this Lego plate to be more sturdy. When you pick it up, it sags, so it isn't good to carry it when you have something on top. It is just fine set on a table or hard flat surface though."
1,Pretty disappointing,"This is one flimsy piece of plastic! I was very disappointed when i received this Lego version of the base plate. Our Duplo version is much thicker and sturdier, so it's a surprise that this one is so thin and cheap. I certainly don't feel like I should have to get out my glue gun and MDF to ""fix"" it, as another reviewer did. (Great problem solving, but it shouldn't be necessary.) Alas, we will keep it because a base plate really is needed for any serious Lego creation, and there aren't alternatives that I know of. C'mon, Lego, I expect much higher quality from you!"
1,A Nearly Useless Accessory to Lego Building Blocks,I bought this building plate for my granddaughter knowing its very serious limits. It is not rigid enough to support any Lego project unless it is placed on a flat hard surface. After it arrived I immediately glued it to a 15 x 15 inch board to make it usable. Why would Lego produce such a chintzy product?
1,NOT GOOD TO BUILD ON - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"I purchased Lego Duplo blocks for my toddler, and thought this would be a great idea to build things on, since it would keep everything in place. I didn't realize, however, that it would be a FLIMSY piece of plastic that should cost NO MORE THAN $2 - and even THEN I wouldn't buy it! It moves/slides around too easily, so it won't stay in place on a tabletop, and I doubt it would on any other surface! I put my daughter's on top of a Little Tikes table (a GREAT buy for $[...] - she LOVES it!), and used DUCT TAPE to secure it to the table! (little loops under the plate around all of the edges, so she can't peel it up!) It works well, but this is the ONLY way I can see it doing so! FIND ANYTHING ELSE TO BUILD ON TOP OF - MAYBE EVEN THOSE TABLES THEY MAKE SPECIFICALLY FOR LEGO-BUILDING!!!!!"
5,nice product,This is a very useful addition to any LEGO set. Note that the board is rather flexible.
5,Great Building Surface,We gave this to our son for Christmas and he loves it. It's much bigger than the ones that you get with a Lego set and provides a large area to build on. Keeps him occupied for hours!
3,"My son wishes it was more durable, but loves it anyway!!",When we first received the product it was in a wrap and very flexible. Which I thought it would be a little more solid. My son collects legos and enjoys the platform but does wish that it was more sturdy as it is hard to travel with it from one room to the next without it bending almost in half.
5,Everyone needs one...,"Any kid that has Legos, should also have one of these build-it platforms. Now my grandson can move his multi-section projects, rather than take them apart."
4,Great Product,"We needed a big base plate for a project for my son's school book report. This extra large baseplate was perfect for the lego map he built for the book he read. It came quickly, we are prime members, and was in perfect condition. It was exactly what we needed for the lego project."
5,Very Happy with Buzz Lightyear gloves.,"The gloves were exactly what my grandson wanted. When combined with the rest of the costume, they look adorable. They arrived in a timely manner and I appreciated that."
2,TOO BIG,"These were bought for my 5 year old son. The fingers were so long, i tried them on my 8 year old son and they were too big for him too.. I dont understand why they would make them so long. My son loves the gloves, but if i had known about the fingers, i wouldnt have spent my money on them."
2,Fingers too long,My son is 5 and the fingers on this are man sized so he never could use it. Waste of money.
2,Fingers Too Long,The gloves were great except they were way too large for a child. We had to cut the fingers off for my grandson to wear them.
3,"Good gloves, but don't fit sz4","I bought these to go with my son's costume. He's a sz 4. They were absolutely huge!!! Went all the way up past his elbows. I think they would fit a 8-10 year old ok, but not a little one. Otherwise, ok - went with the rest of the costume. I'd wish for a little better quality, but as it's only going to be worn once, they would work."
3,"Really? For a child? Maybe an alien child with 9"" fingers.","My son is in to Buzz Lightyear. I thought he'd love these gloves to go along with his ""wing/jet-pack"" and laser gun. The quality of these gloves are descent, but my goodness. My son is a normal 5 year old, and the fingers on these gloves are better sized to an adult. The fingers on these gloves are crazy long so he walks around with these crooked hook fingers (kind of funny). Oh well, he's not complaining about it much."
3,A little big,"Way too big for my 2 year old, they fit on my hands! but nice idea and he still wears them."
2,Not sized for young children,"Just got the gloves yesterday, and was quite disappointed. Although they are described as kids' gloves, the fingers are too long for a 4-year old. They seem to be inappropriately sized for young children."
2,Harlequin romance/thriller with werewolves,"I bought and read Ms. Arthur's ""Full Moon Rising"" and REALLY enjoyed it. So I went back into the author's works and bought and read ""Beneath a Darkening Moon"" and ""Beneath a Rising Moon"" and was very disappointed with both books. Full Moon Rising is far superior to the other two; it shows the author has made a very nice leap of progress in her writing skills in the years between them. I will happily buy and read anything new that the author writes, but won't delve further back into her works."
4,Keri Arthur prolific writer.,I have read almost all of the books by this author. I liked this one but not as much as the Dark Angles series. I will read therest as they become available. Recommend this author to all paranormal devotees.
2,Big disappointment by one of my favorite authors,"What story and plot there was; was woven around so much vulpine bodice tearing and hormone heaving that I could barely follow the plot action (which would have been excellent). I'm all for sex, but, this actually got tiresome."
4,Beneath a Darkening Moon,"I'm a big Keri Arthur fan, particularly of her Riley Jensen and Dark Angels series. The Ripple Creek Werewolf books are in my opinion not as good, probably because they're earlier works. I did, however, find that I like this second of the 2 better than the first... a little more wolf and a little less breathless romance."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book. If you've never played the blues before, like me, this is the book for you. You start out with some basic shuffels and move right into some fun and impressive songs. It takes some focus and practice but by working with the book and CD a little every day, you'll find new joy and passion in that old accoustic sitting in the corner. If you're sick of strumming through songs and want to let the guitar ""sing"" for you, you won't regret buying this book."
4,Very useful book,"Detailed transcriptions of Jaco's great bass lines. Very useful, good for improving vocabulary; also great for improving techinque by playing the parts a tempo. The tunes featured are some of the greatest recordings by Jaco, including two he made with Joni Mitchell, ""Bright Size Life"" and many Weather Report remarkable pieces. Absences to regret: ""Havona"", and the fact that the transcription of ""Birdland"" includes only the intro with false harmonics."
1,"Accurate, but where's the meat?!","Is the notation and tab accurate? Yup, but who cares, there's a million tab sites you can get that from. What I was hopping for was a break down on his right hand positioning and technique as well as his left hand. On tunes like Portrait of Tracy, where there are multiple lines going on at once, technique is very important. All of Towey's Commentary seemed bent on deifying Jaco. That's useless, Jaco's music Deify's itself. Give me adaquate information on how to place my hands in order to play the material!"
3,THIS IS GREAT,HI I LOVE THIS CD THIS IS A CUBAN GROUP THAT IS WERE I FRON I WILL LOVE TO LISTEN TO SOME OF THE SONGS IF I BEABLE TO COLLECT MORE INFORMATION THAT WILL BE FINE
2,"its nice, but it falls short","its a nice ring, but the pearl keeps popping off, i had it glued back on but it doesn't stay and i've only had this ring for about 5 months, very disappointing"
5,take one,"Great sound! good selection of songs excellent guitarplaying, with his son Ben Marvin on second guitar and rhytm guitar. The only thing I missed was a drumsolowhat more can I say when I like the way he plays"
4,Well written and exciting.,"I brought this book not realizing it was both ""Christian"" and ""science fiction"" I was surprised at the ability of the writer to pull me into the landscape, as I live in the Bitterroot area of Western Montana. John Moore does an excellant job of bringing his ""Daniel"" and Daniel's world to life. The groups left after world wide disasters are believable to a western mindset. Some of them live here now. As to the Christian message, I say ""well done"". I will be looking at more of this writers work."
3,Satisfactory,This was our book club book for December and it was very hard to get into. I didn't love it and likely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I would note this is not my type of book.
1,"Sharp edged, thin.","Perhaps it is because we are new to candle making but these molds did not serve the purpose. The plastic bag holding the molds had the text, ""warning, sharp edges"" and it was a fitting warning, but it would have been helpful if the website description also had the same warning notice.We tried sanding down the sharp edges, which took some time and work, but then found that after cleaning off the sanded material that the molds soon began rusting.Also the ""pre-wicked wick clip"" does not hold the wick in the center of the mold as the picture might suggest. Obviously those familiar with candle making may know all of this, but those new to it may appreciate these details in deciding on a purchase."
2,not for the pro chef,"the book has alot of ideas that are photographed step by step, but apart from a handful of ideas, the examples given are kitsch and outdated, great as a conversation piece at a boring home cocktail party, but for a pro chef - forgettaboutit."
5,Exceptional vegetable carvings!!,"The first few pages are garnishes by Tomi Carey, which are average to OK..but everything after that is superb!! If you have imagination, you can craft masterpieces by following the guidelines/samples in the book. But if you don't have an artistic bone in you, then find another basic beginers book. Excellent buy!"
1,A misleading and poorly researched book.,"The book claims to have over 200 unpublished photos but these photos are of generally poor quality and rarely show Luftwaffe aircraft! Many of them show ground target scenes, allied aircraft or other subjects. However, the most objectionable thing of all are the captions to the photos of the Luftwaffe aircraft that are included (many of which are old standard shots seen many times before) which are often completely misidentified as to the manufacturer, major type of aircraft, the sub-type, the location, unit, date and other information. This is one of the worst books in my collection of over 500 books on the Luftwaffe and not worth buying."
1,"Very, very bad","I bought this book a long time ago for very little money - still too much as it turns out. It is indeed the very worst book you can have in your luftwaffe library. Just take this as an example of the 'expertise' of ""Dr. John Pimlott, an expert on the history of World War II"": the good doctor translates Staffelkapitän - the German equivalent of squadron leader (literally captain) - as .... Staff Captain!I'm surprised Reichsmarschall didn't get translated to Emperial Train Yard or something.Seriously. Errors abound. Stay well clear of this.There are many great Luftwaffe (overview) titles out there. This one's not it!This is so far behind suchs works as Don Caldwell's ""Luftwaffe over the Reich""."
1,"BIG,BAD,BABBLIN'BOB SPEAKS","I'd like to POP the producer of this CD right in the chops. What drivel. Too much pompus self indulgence. Roll over Beetoven, but don't tell John Lennon the news."
3,Much ado about nothing,"I have been a Waylon fan since 1967 and I missed this one when it came out if it ever did play in Sydney NS which is where I was living at that time. It always ticked me off that I hadn't seen it so when I was going through Amazon and saw it listed I had to get it. However I should have listened to Waylon when he said it went straight to the driveins which would be straight to video these days. The movie is so stereotypical of the time that it almost ridiculous to watch, my wife said that she would have a hard time watching Mary Frann on Newhart after that. I am glad that I bought the DVD but if I was to do it again I would look for a used one as it is imported from Germany. As I said I am a big Waylon fan and if you are you should see the movie, he wasn't that bad but the story was, but you can't have everything. Ingham."
5,Handy Little Tool,I've owned this Mini-Drill/Driver for about a year and it hasn't let me down yet. It isn't as powerful as my Dewalt 14 volt drill but for the in home projects it's perfect. I recently bought a new home and wanted to change all 37 door knobs. The screws are very long and my arm would have crampped up half way through this project but with this tool it was almost fun. The Green/Red Forward/Reverse indicator light is a nice feature. It is what it is and for $40 a great addition to my tool collection.
4,Mighty Little Driver,"Love it! A friend of ours got one for Christmas so I knew I had to have it. It's lightweight, holds a good charge, doesn't take up much space. I had a large painting project, used it to unscrew the switch & plug plates. I was done in no time! I wore a 3 pocket apron; driver in one, screws & plates in the others. Only negative was getting it to sit on the charger properly; it doesn't really ""lock"" into the charger.Update: The charger finally gave out and doesn't charge the drill at all. That took less than a year to stop working."
5,Skil 2336-01 3.6V 120V Mini-Drill/Driver,"Excellent product, does everything effortlessly.I highly recommend it!"
1,"I give it a score of 1, even though it is a great little tool.","This little tool is just wonderful, does exactly what it was designed to, always ready, for its size powerful enough to do lots of work and take the labor load off its owner. I am an apartment dweller and with the cost of repairs today this drill earns its keep.The reason I gave it a score of one, is not the drill, which deserves a 5, but the stupidity of the manufacturer, Skill in packaging it, on the charger base, there is a piece of pressure sensitive foam, it was put on and looks like it really belongs, after using mine for a while I had the same problem as the gentlemen before me, it would not charge, upon examining it, I saw the foam, and realized that it was impossible for the contacts to contact, removed the foam, all is well, I wonder how many of these drills were returned because they could not be charged, brilliant Skil, just brilliant"
2,Not a good book for 4 and 5 year olds,"I was a bit shocked when my son and I sat down to read his library book. This book, in my opinion, was not a good book for this young age. One of the pages has blood splatted all over it. It is about talking about others (gossiping) and how the females want to look their best for the males. It also states that they get into a blood battle!"
5,One of the most talented bands ive heard in a while,i saw these guys about 3 months ago in dallas and they blew me away. i then bought there cd and was blown away again. If you are looking for something different from the crap they play on the radio defenetly check out this cd its a mixture of 311 funk and rap check it out
5,Unbelieveable,"This CD is frankly one of the finest CDs I own. Here's the kicker, it doesn't capture a tenth of what this band can do in a live setting. Go see Pomeroy where ever they play, and buy this album, cuz its amazing"
3,Good stuff but 'live' is better,"Pomeroy is a super band and their style is hella-good. I have to admit that this CD does not do them justice. I've seen them live and they tear the roof off. 'My Paradise', 'Rebound', and 'Summer Night' are my favorites, but there are better versions then the ones on this CD. They are heading into the studio in late March to lay down their next CD. I am waiting anxiously. They note on there website that they are going to do a better job of capturing the energy of their shows."
3,getting there,"I'm not trying to give Pomeroy a bad name, but I'm not trying to praise them as well. Sure they are just trying to make a name for themselves, and have a good reason too...they are pretty damn good.The only problem w/ Pomeroy is that they have a hard time finding fans outside of the ks/ne midwest area. Pomeroy kinda has a similar style to rap/rock bands such as 311 and some Incubus, but for the most part emmulate 311. Pomeroy has potential, and this album may grab a handful of fans, but if they hit it big, watch out, they could explode. On the other side, they may just be another local band that had a few good songs. Pomeroy is highly unpredictable at this point in terms of fan support. It's hard to say where they will be in the next few years."
1,What is the point?,"This band reminded me far too much of 311. Musically and vocally the band seemed to be imitating 311. The whiny rap-like lyrics seemed trite and easily dismissed. The music itself (without vocals) was good, the bass lines were quite notable. If you can find their tracks without vocals or have a karaoke machine, go ahead and buy it. Listen to it first, I implore you. 311 is better."
1,Broken packing,"When this came, the DVD package that holds both the DVDs was completely destroyed. I'm hoping the movies still play okay as they don't appear to have any scratches on them. I like buying the sets in which it has both movies in one case which helps as I'm a big movie collector. However, because the DVD case was completely destroyed, I really didn't 'save' anything."
5,Very good little mic for my Sony Camcorder,"I bought this to work along with my Sony Camcorder. The built in Mic is pretty useless, and with this little add on, I'm much happier with the audio in my recordings. It comes with a windsock that works great! If you're looking to spend a little to upgrade your recorded audio, this is the mic for you."
2,Add roadways for your LEGO creations,2 strait roadways to add to your town. A nice addition to anyone who has LEGO Town sets. Every town needs roads and these base plates provide them.
4,Solid information,"I have taught adults with math anxiety for many years and use many of the techniques described in this book. They work! The book seems well written, and should be helpful for the math-anxious. The author has a great deal of experience working with math-anxious students at a community college. The intended audience is definitely college students, which makes some parts of the book less useful for the adults that I work with. The section on ""Effective Math Study Skills"" might be overwhelming to many; following all the prescriptions sounds like a full-time job.To Ms. Arem's recommendations, I would add that one should do aerobic exercise regularly to reduce stress. I also recommend Brain Gym exercises, which one can find out about online."
2,too much psychology not enough practical application,"I bought Mastering Mathematics How to Be a Great Math Student at the same time. I read it in 2 days and came away with easy useful practical applications that can be immediately put into use to improve my learning experience and grades in all of my classes. Then, I read Conquering Math Anxiety. It is a chore to read and cluttered with time consuming psychological exercises that may be useful for next year or the year after. Basically, there is not much of immediate useful relevance to math or any subject until late in the book (starting at chapter 7)."
1,Clichéd drivel,"This is one of the emptiest, most two dimensional books I have ever read. Schonstein repeats words such as philosophy, astronomy and ""stories"" ad nauseum without ever once furnishing the reader with a single description. Her idea of a deep philisophical argument is ""is there a god?"". Thoroughtly unoriginal and pretentious."
2,Not so good,"This bag is too expensive, and you can,t put much items in this bag. I don,t rate thsi but wit 50 %"
1,lame and unfunny. Better concept than execution,"With the Comic Strip and other well-known British comedy players and the ostensibly clever plot I thought that this could be good lark. No way. Laughed twice the whole movie. The idea of some proles feasting on the upper classes and sloan rangers must have seemed good in a pub but the script is dull. The principal players are pretty unknown in the US and the stars that are better known names are onscreen for seconds. To add insult to movie injury, Fiona Richmond, a starlet known for shedding her clothes at the drop of a hat, doesn't disrobe at all! Koo Stark, a soft-core actress(?) who gained her fame dating one of the British Royals appears for about 15 seconds--clothed. Lots of four letter words but virtually no humor. The only possible reason to watch this is to see how many recognizable faces flash by on the screen. (for example Paul McCartney...maybe 10 seconds). That's about all the time this deserves"
2,This wasn't as funny as I thought it would be,"I bought this movie because Dawn French was listed as one of the stars. I was greatly disappointed as her role in it was only a couple minutes. Also, I really didn't find this movie all that funny."
5,Review,"Good british comedy with Motorhead and some of the guys from The Young Ones. Motorhead does all the music. Good price, good quality, recieved quick. No problems."
1,not much like french and saunders,This video was horrible. We could not make it through more than half and it was a relief to turn it off. It was crude and tasteless which would have been fine if it was funny. I love French and Saunders but they were only minor characters in this mess
4,Eye opening!,"I have always been one of those that was completely turned off as soon as someone started talking about the Illuminati. I certainly wouldn't consider myself a conspiracy theorist. That said, here is a historical work that flips all that on it's head. Once and for all, I wanted to get to the bottom of all this Illuminati talk as did this author.The reader will get an eye witness account of a secret society that had infiltrated the Free Mason organization centuries ago with the sole intent of ending world religions and sovereign governments.The author shows how the French Revolution was the very work of this group of men.I would have rated it a five star but the old English print made for slow reading. I am not aware of a recent reprint of this work with modern English characters."
5,HE SPEAK THE TRUTH,"HAVING SEEN HIM ON ALEX JONES, I WAS COMPELLED TO BUY HIS BOOKS.HIS KNOWLEDGEABLE PERSONALITY COMES THRU IN THIS EPIC INFORMATIVE TOME.THX MAN!"
3,Realistic?,"I found this DVD to be very refreshing and uplifting. One disappointment that I have with it is that the couples are all very young, like in their late teens and early twenties; I wish it had at least one example of a couple that had to wait into their thirties or forties for the right one."
5,"4 years old and still an amazing camera, fantastic battery!","I've had this camera for about 4 years and absolutely love it. The video is great, and the point & shoot is easy to use. The most amazing thing about this camera is the rechargeable battery. Mine came with an extra one which is great for travel. The battery lasts and lasts before I need to recharge it. I know several people who bought newer, more expensive cameras and it seems they're always running out of battery life. I take several video clips, about 5 to 10 minutes long, and dozens and dozens of pics on my 4GB memory card. It's rare that I run out of space. You have to get in the habit of downloading them to your computer and free up space for the next event, or just buy extra memory cards. Another plus for this camera is that it fits in my pants pocket or shirt pocket easily. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
3,Casio camera review,"Like previous Casio cameras I have owned, ths camera fits the bill even though I wanted a silver model. It's ok."
2,OK but falls short - returned mine,"This camera is ok, but not worth it. 1st off 10 mega pixles is useless unless you're printing posters, so don't buy into that hype. The camera takes forever to cycle so you wind up missing shots. The night shooting isn't that great, and quite grainy. It is compact and the best shot function is neat but useless in my book, particularly b/c in night shot mode, all my shots were either dark, blurry, or grainy...so it didn't make much of a difference. I just felt that the shots (the good ones) just weren't sharp enough so that's why I'm returning it. Additionally, the buttons aren't ergonomically placed...my fingers keep fumbling over them and it's heard to zoom in and out at times. One positive note is that the movie camera mode is very good."
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I gave in and purchased this camera even though I'm a stickler for Cannon's and Nikkon's. I read the good reviews on Amazon and decided to go for it. For $200 you get 10.1 megapixels! No one...is offering the same thing for this amount of money. It almost makes me think Casio's pricing department made a huge mistake! I got this camera the first weekend of August and I've taken almost 300 pictures and I still have a full battery! My old camera pooped out after an hour or so. This digital camera puts my old one to shame and now I'm kinda glad it broke. I've taken pictures at a concert, a football game and from a hot air balloon ride. The color is amazing as well as the ease of use. You dont' get a very detailed user's manual, but it's not rocket science."
1,Dont bother with this camera,"I bought this camera about 8 months ago for the 10MP quality and the size of the camera. I also had a new baby and figured this would be great to take those precious moments while he grew up. I figured that at 10MP the pictures should be crystal clear. I have been quickly finding out that most of the pictures you take with this camera are always blurry for some reason. There doesnt seem to be an easy way of taking clear pictures unless abslutely nothing is moving in the picture. Even with the anti-shake on and custom picture settings, you can not get a clear picture 6 out of 10 times trying. I am now looking to go back to my Sony cybershot since it seemed to provide better picture quality than this."
1,no go,"Bought this digital camera a few days ago. Worked great for the first week. By that time I had thrown out the box, pachaging and info as to who I actually bought this from. Then two buttons stopped working. Can't seem to get them to work. Now I have no idea where it came from and who to send it back to. Amazon doesn't actually sell these things, they pass it off to a third party.Also, the shutter button has a delay. I took the first 40 pictures of the back of my dog's head because by the time the shutter actually engages teh subject has moved. Use this camera only for taking pictures of a mountain or something.The memory that is in the camera is about enough for 5 photos, so you need to buy a memory card as well. The memory cards are on the sales page, but I didn't get an idea if I needed one, till it showed up.Not sure what I am going to do with this broken camera. Sure don't want to buy one from Amazon again."
3,A bad experience that turned out good.,It is a nice camera. It has what I expected being I own an EX Z57. It had one flaw which was the battery door wouldn't stay closed. That issue was resolved by both parties making it a good experience.
5,Great camera,"1st new digital camera in over 6 years. All I can is wow. Great pics, fast shutter speed, good menus, 7 frames/second capability, lots of power on/save setting options. Video capability is really good too. It won't replace a video camera but to grab some quick videos at a party it's awesome."
4,Good one,"The exilim series is a GOOD one from casio. It's best feature is it's weight and size IF that's important to you -- it is to me in this case. If you need more weight in a camera to feel comfortable, this may not be for you. The pix are as good as most cameras that size, the sexy black is a show stopper, but 10 pixels??? How much is too much? You won't be disappointed with this camera."
4,Great ability in a tiny package,"After using this camera on a couple of trips, and now being familiar with its features, I have to say I'm very happy with it. I purchased this after I lost my older Exilim camera, and this smaller, lighter version is much easier to use.As with any ultracompact camera, don't expect the kind of photography you'd get from a digital SLR, or a dedicated video recorder. However, the quality of the pics & video is excellent, seeing as it's coming from such a small package.The only reason this is 4 and not 5 stars, is because of the inability to set advanced settings for each shot. You have to select pre-set modes (like ""Party"", ""Sports"", or ""Scenic"") to get the right shutter speed or light sensitivity that you want. This can be frustrating until you familiarize yourself with the different modes available. Once you know your camera, though, it is enjoyable to use.This camera's best for casual to intermediate photography, which is what I do."
3,Memory card disappointment,"Reviewers have mentioned that you can use an 8GB card with this exilim. You can't. The maximum is 4GB. I just purchased this with an 8GB card, and it deleted more than half of my pictures upon first upload with no warning. When I called Casio, they told me that it only supports a 4GB card, and that they only support Toshiba, Panasonic, and Sandisk, not Kingston. Very disappointing. I wouldn't mind if they had mentioned it prominently on their site, or in the description. Perhaps they do somewhere, but it seems like an important fact that should be prominently displayed. Customer service did nothing to help. Next time, I'm going back to Canon."
3,Not as good as My Exilim EX-Z3,"I have an EX-Z3 3.2 Megapixel Casio that I have absolutely loved over the past 4 years or so and it has take great pictures inside with the flash and outside. The quality of the pics are incredible, and it was largely the reason I bought my new EX-Z1050. So far, I am disappointed. The pics are not as clear and crisp. I am using the dafault settings, and admit that it may be corrected if I read the manual in depth and adjust the settings, but that in itself is disappointing, since the EX-Z3 seemed like perfection out of the box. I have also read that the flash is weak, so that might be the reason, but I think for most people, this will be 75% of where they use this camera (inside). I will keep trying , but I am back to using the old EX-Z3 instead of the new EX-Z1050. Plus, I got used to the old charging method and hate that I have to take the battery pack out to charge it. If my experience gets better, I'll write an update."
5,Very nice....,"My first digital camera was Canon and needed replacement. So I bought Exilim EX-Z1050 since I needed something better than 4 mega-pixel. I have used mine for almost a year now and I love it. It's in my purse everyday for that special moment and the battery life is amazing. I had to charge my Canon Elf very often but I could almost forget about recharging with this Exilim. Also, video is also great. Very easy to use and light for everyday use. Great everyday use camera."
4,A Very Good Camera,"I have had the camera for a couple of weeks now. I am still becoming more familiar with the features, but so far - I am very pleased with it. It is very easy to use. The pictures are sharp. I will give it a real test when I go on vacation."
3,Easy to use but...,It's easy to use and certainly a compact size but you give up alot on quality of photo. I was going to sell my Sony Steady Shot but found out that the Z1050 is incapable of sending out a flash beyond 5 foot. I'll keep both cameras: the Z1050 is easy to carry and when I'm shooting pics at a distance indoors I'll just take the Sony.
1,Bad Service,The camera I was sent was not new as advertised. I returned it and was supposed to receive a new camera as promised. Never got because Adorama Camera said that model had been discontinued. Finally got my money back but am not happy with the way I was treated.
5,Awesome Camera,"This is the best camera I have ever owned. Easy to use, lightweight, durable, and the list goes on. This is one of the best purchases I have ever made and I am thinking of getting one for my mom."
1,Too hard to use. cheap. crap.,menu impossible to navigate. self timer only available in easy mode where you then cannot adjust lighting. too tiny to hold. labels on camera too tiny to read. its crap. and whats this about amazon selling it for over $250?!! i paid $45 at radio shack.
1,Low quality pics + died in 2 years,"I purchased mine with HSN and only kept it because back then it was the largest screen on the smallest camera. All other features were complelte disappointment (i.e. - it takes 5 steps to turn off FLASH), pictures are times worse than on my old and very heavy Camedia. In less than 3 years, it went totally dead. I paid over $200 and learned my lesson - CANNON makes best digital cameras. No additional search needed."
5,Very Awesome!,"This camera takes amazing pictures. There are so many settings with this camera. I was very stuck picking a camera at first, then I narrowed it down to either this camera or the Canon SD900. I decided to get this one because it was $80.00 cheaper. It gives a lot of bang for your buck. Also in the continuous shot mode you can take so many pics really quickly. Great Battery life. My grade for this cam is an A!"
1,Where's Tony Williams??,"Some compilations of the Platters' songs are not originals. The best sources for original recordings are those issued by Mercury or a two-disc Anthology issued by Rhino. There are several groups still touring as the Platters, although some do not have even a remote connection to the original group."
1,not original lead (tony Williams)...inferior.,"If you are a Platters afficionado, you will be disappointed by these cuts. Only two original members (Herb Reed & David Lynch) are here. Very inferior cuts, lacking the well-known and acclaimed intensity of the original lead singer."
3,THE PLATTERS 16 GREATEST HITS,MY HUSBAND AND I WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD. IT DIDN'T EVEN SOUND LIKE THE PLATTERS BUT A VERY POOR IMITATION.
1,THE GREAT IMPOSTERS,"Save your money, without Tony Williams & Zola Taylor it's just not worth listening to. The c/d does make a good oversized earring though or maybe it could be used as a ""frizbee""."
1,horrible!!!!!!,This book was so bad I'm surprised they even made a show about it(although I'm super glad they did its one of my addictions). Characters in the book were way underdeveloped and so whiney.... and please next time u decide on covers for your book they should at least match the descriptions in the book smh... couldn't even finish the series after book 3 it was worse than the dentists office
2,Disappointed,"Ok, so I love the tv series and was hopeful the books would be even better. Not even close, not by a long shot. They drag on a bIt and the characters are very flat. Glad to see Elena finally gets over herself later in the series. The romance with Edward is so disappointing. Not steamy at all. Oh well, there's always the Twilight series."
1,love the show not the books,"Not worth my time. The story line is awful, I did not like the characters at all. I wanted to get my red pen out and mark the books, because of poor writing. I watch the show own the DVDs but the books are lacking in so many ways. The author should have stopped after the 1st. It was OK and I like it but after then it went way down him into should be burned."
1,It was so sappy...,"The dialect of this book was very pathetic. ""I love you,"" and all that...this character did a complete 180 turning into some lovesick fool. This book reminded me of that other teenage **** out there like Sweet Valley and Fear Street...nothing creepy, nothing fantastic, it's just a book you read for the moment then forget about.This isn't a book your teacher will be impressed to see you read, that's for sure..."
4,Fans Will Not Be Disappointed,"After her car runs off the road into the river, Elena is none too happy to find herself resurrected as a vampire. However, she has little time to feel sorry for herself. Evil seems to be brewing in Fell's Church, a ghastly, mysterious force that causes pets to attack their owners, and turns close friends into sinister strangers. Now stronger as a vampire than she ever was as a human, Elena is determined to protect her home town against this nameless menace. She begs Stefan and Damon to look past their differences and work together, but getting these two rivals to trust each other may be the hardest task of all. Fans won't be disappointed by this one. The story is brisk and engaging, and ends with a surprise twist that brings the original trilogy to a satisfying close. Recommended for Ages 15-Up."
3,---,"I was pleasantly surprised with this third installment. If you've been struggling through the first two, keep with it because the third is actually enjoyable and worth reading.It is still cliche and predictable at times, but much improved regarding detail and the story itself. It gains a depth that the first two never even touched. The ending was unexpected, and while it's not what I would prefer, it fits the story perfectly.I am still annoyed with the random scene changes which distract from the story and cause it to flow unevenly, but they are less frequent than in the first two. I am thinking by now that this is just a quirk of the author which she seems to be maturing out of.While it's still not up to par with other series or novels of it's genre and themes, it's extremely improved compared to Smith's previous works in the series. I'm actually glad to have kept pushing on."
3,Surprised,"This book was better than I thought it would be...except for the fact that the author wrote it in a easy way that gave the whole story away. There was no mystery or curiousity while I was reading this book. I don't know, I usually read Sherwood Smith or Tamora Pierce...maybe this S&M isn't my thing."
2,Not as expected,"Unlike the TV series, I could not get into these characters. They are portrayed quite differently on TV and that's the version of Elena I like... sorry."
3,I didn't like the ending,"What a horrible way to end the book! I do like how Damon turned out at the end but still, it's so sad. How many books are in this series??"
3,Ehhhh...,"The books are kinda lame. As a big fan of the TV show, that's hard to say. Save your money and just borrow the books from the Library."
5,Love These Books,"They are a bit off from the tv series, but I think that the books are more interesting. Must read!"
4,Reading with Tequila,"I really like the progression of The Vampire Diaries. The Awakening was okay, The Struggle was good and The Fury was pretty fantastic. I completely stand by my earlier opinion that you must read this series in order and preferably one right after another. This series has moved from being one of your generic vampire stories with the required love triangle to being so much more.Elena's becoming a vampire was surprising and the revelation of the ultimate villain of the series was truly shocking. The Fury is a wild ride leading to a sad and unexpected ending. I love how Elena learns that having a few close friends you can count one is so much more important than having a pack of less than loyal followers and hangers-on. The Fury is definitely my favorite in the series so far."
4,Review From One Book At A Time,"I liked this book the best so far. It was dark, dangerous, and left me guessing until the very end. Elena was interesting as a vampire. Damon continues to surprise me. I just wish Stephan would get some life in him. He's so engrossed in Elena and his past relationship with Catherine, that there doesn't seem much else to his character. In the show, the choice is obvious, but not so in the books. I like how all the characters pull together to battle what is controlling the town. I wonder how they will play this book out in the TV show."
5,Fantastic Teaser!,This is one my most favourite books of all times and I recommend this book to everyone. It builts the suspense up beautifully and ends everything with a bang. A very good read!
5,IT WAS GREAT!!!,I really really really liked this book and the whole series of the vampire diaries! I would recommend this book to any L. J. Smith fan!! I really like her books. Once i get started on one i just can't put it down! :o)
3,"Good read, but not the best.","I love vampire romances, and this one is pretty good. It does make the teens happy, so I guess it serves it's purpose. Wish it was written with more detail so the characters and scenes would 'pop' in my imagination. Right now I see a blonde paper doll. Would love more depth."
3,Young Adult books,"I enjoyed the TV series and thought I would like the books but as a 34yr old mother, I much preferred the TV version. These books are probably really well suited to the young adults they are written for."
3,Beautiful voice but one worthy of better material.,"I anxiously awaited the release of Lashell's cd after seeing her win Oprah's talent contest and then seeing her on Good Morning America. While there's no denying she's possesses a beautiful gift, she's been handed some unfortunate songs. The lyrical content (or lack thereof) of ""This Is Who I Am"" and ""Faith"" among others, makes me wonder if Mariah Carey has taken up a second job as a ghost songwriter. Some of the arrangements are wooden and just clunkily plod along. Rarely do they give her voice the opportunity to soar. Quite frankly they sound like something one might hear at some really bad karaoke bar. Anyone who's had the pleasure of hearing Mrs. Griffin sing, knows she deserves much better.June 20 - update - Been living with this for a few weeks now. Even though I still feel it's a very uneven project, it may be well-worth the price of admission on the strength of ""Learn To Breathe"" and ""Free""."
3,"Her Voice is Beautiful, but Needs Better Material",I so enjoyed Lashell and her song choices on Oprah. Her beautiful voice and her interpretation of the songs brought me to tears. I wish the producers of the CD allowed Lashell to choose her songs. Only two songs appealed to me on this album. The three-star rating is not a reflection on Lashell's singing; it's the material.
4,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"This is a very good cd. I bought this cd after hearing the single, ""Get away"". I didn't think it would be so spirtually inclined but that wasn't a negative. Ms. LaShell has a beautiful voice and her songs are positive and uplifting."
1,Dissapointing Peterson's,"This is book is not worth a buck... I bought it, but just now I am going to send it back. It contains 600 scholarships, but you won't find one which would be good for you. I found only 10 scholarships for undergraduate business program and none of them was suitable for me. It also contains scholarships for US residents - I thought it is a book for int'l students! You must very lucky to find at least 1 scholarship which you'd be eligible for... I had higher expectations of Peterson's. Dissapointed..."
4,very comfortable.,"I've looked everywhere for a panty that fits like this one. It's very comfortable, smooth, and feels good on my skin. Something great to wear at home with nothing else. I'll most likely get more of these. Probably my favorite panty right now."
2,Disappointed!,"Excited to get item for my SUV. Followed all directions to apply. Looked great until one fell off while driving on Interstate. Now I have one, and I am out a lot of money. Very hesitant to purchase again. Disappointed and feel that for the amount the item cost, it should have more secure way to attach to vehicle."
3,"OK, But how do they attach?",Received black out covers on time although was suprised to learn that they are attached with Velcro & 2 sided tape. Returned for credit.
2,Bad Advice from an Investment Adviser,"Though Edelman has some good advice about building wealth, this pre-recession book (published in 2001), is way to optimistic about financial trends. The biggest issues I had with the book are that Edelman encourages people to get as large a mortgage as they can and then invest the money they do not put into the house. When giving his examples he uses a 12% annual investment return (you read that right - 12%). The payment of debt is guaranteed, while investment returns have inherent risk and are seldom guaranteed outside of low interest debt instruments (which still have default risk). He also does little to help people prepare for job loss. These two issues have come to the forefront since the recession and housing bubble, but they have been risks forever. For Edelman to treat these topics so optimistically is just bad advice."
4,Not the best financial book I've read but not the worst.,"I'm surprised at how many people have given this book a one star and said it's the worst book they've ever read. I've read hundreds of financial books over the years and this book by far is not the best I've ever read nor is it the worst. The information is very basic and rudimentary but the best ""secret"" is by following the recommendations in the book religiously you will become financially independent, over time. It won't happen over night but it will happen. The problem is everyone has their own definition of ""extraordinary wealth"". I consider myself middle class but I don't have any debt other then my mortgage and have the ability to pay cash for anything I need or want. But, I'm not wealthy. Other people may think I am. It's all in the mind."
2,Redundant,"A lot of redunduncy. You don't miss anything if you skip ""in their own words"" pages.There should have been a mention of ""retirement planning"" on the title of this book. The book is mainly for 401K investments. Not a help for a reader who is after inspirational stories of ""ordinary people with extraordinary wealth""."
2,Third book is not a charm,"I loved Ric's first two books, especially ""the truth about money"", but this book didn't tell me anything new. It doesn't seem like much thought was put into the book. It comes across as a cheap imitation of ""the Millionaire Next Door"" (which was a great book). Half the book is filled with Ric's clients sharing their financial anecdotes. These stories are very repetitive and very unenlightening. Some of the reviews below seem to be talking about ""The Truth About Money"". If you don't have that book go get it first."
2,Mixed Review,"This is the third financial book I have read. I got the feeling that without a Financial advisor I am doomed to failure. I also got the feeling that It doesn't matter what your rate of return is on your investments...a ""dont worry about that"" attitude. Some of his advise I dont buy, such as ""buy and hold"" and maintaining debt. Debt is a four letter word. If your new to the World of finance, It's an ok book. Continue reading more books on finance for a different view."
2,"More of the same, not much new","Edelman uses a survey of his clients to rehash eight previously-discussed lessons on personal finance and investing. Really, not much new here and the exhaustive quotes and testamonials from his clients add very little. If you have read his work before, which is very good, I recommend passing on this one."
2,PRODUCT IS ALL,"I believe our boy ric is just cranking out product at this point. This book is all filler and bad advice for most people. Hello? Stocks are a gamble, don't tell me about 12% over the last half decade...what have you done for me lately?I know a few people who won't be retiring as planned based on the beatings the market took in the last two years.And to tell people not to pay off their mortgage ASAP is a disservice. Period. A ... mortgage paid off in thirty years will cost you [more]. It does not make sense to pay 3x what something is worth. Even if it appreciates 200% all you have done is broken even.Except to have a horn to blow, I can't imagine why ric continues giving this same advise in every book that has his name on the cover. Every one of his books is a rehash of the same few concepts he seems to maintain a ... grip on beyond all sound financial reason. I can understand why he was broke once, he followed his own advise."
5,Excellent Blueprint to Wealth!!,"Excellent Blueprint to Extraordinary Wealth!!Reviewer: Wendy Pablico from Lawndale, CAThank you, Ric Edelman for your information. Great information on ""carrying a mortgage."" I also found information to share with my who is 17 1/2 year old son. I hope my son will be one of the wealthy people in Ric's future book ;-)My son promised to save $1.50 per day, because that is easy to save. Happy Mom!!Once I opened the book it was hard to put down. I ordered a used copy. Arrived on time in ment condition, I was expecting a paperback but received a hard copy ;-)"
3,"Ordinary People , Ordinary Retirement",This book tells you how retire more comfotably that your neibour and thats about it. I think I'll stick to Robert Kiyosaki
3,Good book about achieving great wealth!,An enjoyable read intended for anybody who isn't already wealthy!
1,Edelman's marketing tool,"Edelman's dedication to his clients as follow tells it all:""To the Clients of Edelman Financial Services Inc.I am priviledged to be associated with these fine people, for they truly are the backbone of America. Being permitted to serve them is the greatest honor.""Few good ideas. Overall writing style is annoying."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I thought this book sucks. It is a terrible read and just plain garbage. Edelman's book The New Rules of Money is a good buy and is probably my favorite book by him. The Truth About Money is a pretty decent book by him as well. I suggest and would recommend either of those over Ordinary People, Extraordinary Wealth. I would also suggest that everyone pick up a copy of Multiple Streams of Income (the regular book not the Internet Income) as it is the absolute best investing book out there. A definite 5 star book."
3,Wealth,THis books first couple of chapters are really exciting to read then as the book goes on it tends to lose its initial appeal. A lot of the writing in the last third of the book are jibberish.
3,Worth Reading,"There is some good information in the book. One problem I had with it is that Edelman endlessly self-promotes his other books in a manner that he seems to think is humorous, but is actually annoying. It makes the author--writing on a serious subject--come off like a carnival huckster."
4,"Intriguing, but thin","There are some excellent ideas in this book. Imagine, it's not always best to pay off a mortgage that has an interest rate lower than the market's long-term average return. Who would have thought that the best strategy for a 401K is NOT to diversify new contributions? Very thought-provoking, but left me yearning for more information about when to diversify the existing balance, etc. But, since the price of the paperback is so low, it's worth it. So, I bought his other book: ""The New Rules of Money"" to get some more in-depth advice and information. His advice seems, at first blush, counterintuitive. But, his logic is undeniable."
3,Don't waste your money,"First off I'd like to say that the information in this book,8 so called secrets,is valuable. Mr. Edelman explains it in an easy to understand way. The reason I say not to waste your money is this. Each secret has a chapter with an average length of 11.5 pages. So basically the good information is in about 90 some pages. The rest of the book is filled with the authors' clients telling you how they do the things that the book says. In my opinion this should be a 100 page book at the most. It took me 2 hours to get all the valuable information out of this book(it is good information). I think the author expanded most of his energy trying to sell you his other books by the numerous footnotes telling you to by his other books. He was trying to be humorous most of the time with the footnotes but it became annoying.My recommendation is..The library"
1,Book Buyers Get Taken Again!!,"The rich do NOT carry mortgages despite what Mr. Ric says.The whole premise of this book is based on what is good for Mr. Ric, who is an unaccredited financial planner--but NOT what is good for you. And since it's your money that he is wasting you should think long and hard before following advice that gives HIM a commission or bonus. Oprah is usually right but on this book she is totally off the mark."
3,Some good information...,"The book had a lot of good information on retirement plans but that was about it. Everything else was either information from one of his other books (which he's just worded differently) or his clients ""talking."" It seemed like his clients could have wrote a better book than he did."
4,Rachel Capil,"When I started at a new job this book was recommended to all new hires so I read it and I thought it was a great book. I really believe anyone that wants to learn more about investing and being finically knowledgeable should read it. I am not an expert by any means, but I thought it was well written and kept me interested in reading it every day. He has helpful suggestions to growing your financial future and that can never hurt anyone who is open to learning."
1,Scrimping all the way to the bank,"Oh Gosh: another personal finance writer who talks down to we poor mortals who spend too much. Does he really think that I want to reuse aluminum foil (like the woman he featured on Oprah) in order to get by? I'd rather work a few more years than get that penny pinching.There is a little good content, but it is undermined by his holier than me tone and constant ads for his other books."
3,"Easy to Say, Hard to Follow","Another financial advisor telling us, the ordinary people, how to amass great wealth by following a few simple rules. For an ordinary guy like myself, saving is a very difficult thing to do because whatever is left from my paycheck, after having paid all my bills, I use it to live life a bit. How can I sacrifice so much so young to simply reassure a comfortable retirement. Don't these people realize we only live once and if we just focus on retirement then we are not fully enjoying our present-day lives. When we grow old we can't have as much fun anymore as when we are younger, so what is the use of having money at such age. Either we invest, save, and wait until we get old or we just simply make the best of our ordinary life with our ordinary paychecks now. Which is it going to be?"
1,"BEWARE this ""sage""","You've got to be kidding! Here's the author's main recommendation: Carry a large mortgage and instead of paying it off, invest money in the stock market because ""you can easily make 10% returns a year."" If that's true, why did so many people lose their life savings recently in stocks and mutual funds? Of course, this guy is a fund manager, which is why he is trying to convince people to invest. BEWARE this sly salesman!!! Edelman encourages people to invest the money they should be using to pay off the mortgage because ""mortgage interest is tax-deductable."" True, but that does not mean the IRS refunds ALL of your mortgage interest. It is still costing you money, so why gamble on stocks that might lose money when you know you can be paying off your house and having that security? If you are into the idea of ""leveraging"" then this book might be for you. But most ""ordinary Americans"" would be better served looking elsewhere."
5,Edge of Never,One of the best videos about a boy learning from seasoned expert skiers on how to ski in the big mts of Europe. Glen Plake said it best there are no second chances. Great movie to watch with great music in the background.. Amust see.. AAAAA+
3,"Readable, But Not Vintage Stuart Woods","Stone Barrington lives a life most guys would kill to have (No pun intended). He is a handsome cop-turned-lawyer who needs an umbrella to keep the women from falling into his lap. The suspense in this novel is erratic. You find yourself hooked for the first 30 pages then wading through the next 2 chapters until the suspense builds again. Much of the plot is completely surreal. You have to suspend your disbelief to get through the book. Woods chose all the right ingredients: sex, murder, etc. They just weren't mixed together well to create a great novel. Makes a decent summer read, but definitely not a great book. If you want a really good Stone Barrington novel, try the first one Woods wrote: ""New York Dead"", a truly unique thriller and one of the best examples of Stuart Woods hitting on all cylinders."
1,Stuart's stinker,"This reads like a formula. The characters, especially Stone are flat and silly. I had 100 pages to go and didn't care if they all got murdered. I hope we have bottomed out and it is up hill for Mr. Woods from here."
3,STONE THE BONE,"Like others who have reviewed WFR, this was a quick read. Stuart Woods gives us another episode of Stone Barrington, complete with sex, money and suspense. Once I picked the book up, it kept my interest until I finished.If there is a fault with WFR, it is the ending. I expected something more detailed and riveting. It didn't happen. I've read several books by Stuart Woods and have found them to be worthwhile. The Stone Barrington character possesses quite a few traits that many of Mr. Woods' male readers probably only dream about. A cut-and-dried ending does not favor Stone."
3,Stone Barrington - You know this is fiction!,"Although I enjoyed the story, I have a real hard time swallowing the character of Stone Barrington! No one with any conscience can jump in and out of bed like this guy, I don't care how good looking he is. With as many women as this guy has slept with he is sure to have a fatal disease by now!"
2,YUCKY,"My name is Cassie and I am 16 years old and I read this book for a school project/presentation. I really didn't think that the book was an absolute page turner, it took much effort to pick it up and continue reading again. To be honest if I wouldn't have had to finish the book for class, I probably would have stopped reading it before I reached the middle. There hardly any details and there is lots of lawyer/cop talk. It would be a great read for an undercover cop, because maybe they could relate, but not a good read for anyone under the age of 18."
1,Pitaful,This book dissapointed me tramendously. It was out of this world rediculous and not at all worth reading. This is by far the worst book by Stuart Woods I believe he should go climb in his mouse hole with Stuart Little after writing this book. The Harper Paper-Back publishing company must of lost a lot of money off this book and should not print any more from this guy becuase they might just wind up with some more nonsense crap. Me myself with my Ph.d shows that I am very intellegent and then I read this book I am not sure anymore I am starting to second guess myself. After I read this book I gave it to a bum and he burned the peice of garbage.
1,NEEDS AN EDITOR,THE SUSPENSE IN THIS BOOK WAS ALMOST NON EXISTANT AND WOODS NEEDS A CRASH COURSE IN GEOGRAPHY. HE KEPS MISPLACING SING SING! HIS EDITOR MUST HAVE BEEN ASLEEP ON THE JOB!
2,Did Vance have a boy or girl?Stone got the genders mixed up.,"I looked at ""Swimming to Catalina"" and saw that it was a girl. He screwed up. In ""Worst Fears Realized"", Stone tells someone at the first of the book that Arrington is married to Vance Calder and is raising their son. Then later in the book, Stone goes to dinner at Vance and Arrington's house and meets their son. I don't understand because it really didn't make a difference to the storyline as to whether it was a girl or a boy. I hate things like that,though."
1,There's an apt title for you,"Having read another Stone Barrington book, ""Dead In The Water"", and not being that impressed by it, I hesitated when a friend offered me this and raved about it. However, my print addiction won out, and I opened it up. Stone Barrington is one of those characters that seem too perfect to be true--rich, handsome, a babe magnet, and an astute detective to boot. The more I read, the less I liked him. It is the rare book that I don't finish, but ""Worst Fears Realized"" is one of them. Granted, Woods writes with a lightning pace, but he sacrifices character and plot development to achieve that speed. The result is a cardboard cutout with occasional bouts of repugnant violence and pedestrian sex."
1,"If You Fear A Rotten Book, Read This One It's A Fright","Sophomoric writing combines with a lousy plot and formulaic characters to take the reader on a shopping trip in New York City and Connecticutt. Woods' books just keep getting worse. Too bad, as Chiefs was an excellent novel."
1,The reviews are much more entertaining than the book!,"I was so puzzled by the depth of stupidity in this book that I had to come to Amazon to see what others thought. It's all right here! readers who are just looking for a fast read loved it, and those who hoped that Woods could still write were horrified by the banality of this effort. Woods loses me at the names of his characters (if only Arrington had married Barrington) Read the reviews, skip the book."
