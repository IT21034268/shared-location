5,mezmerizing,"I am only reviewing this as a procrastinatory exercise, of course, but I feel compelled to pose a question to the lass a few lines below who was so disappointed at the dearth of Alanis-esque ""angst."" Darling, that was a few months ago. You can, I suppose, be forgiven for a wrongheaded judgment made in haste. But do you *still* miss Alanis, Jewel, the Goo-goo dolls?Have I just been blessed with a definitive answer to what lies at the root of pop music's ugly demise in the latter half of this decade?woe is me"
4,Warts & All,"She is good. I mean, REALLY good.There's nothing here as Pop as Supernova; this is the stripped-down version of Phair. She turns the table on the traditionally accepted male-dominated rock and she matches them---unfortunaly, that sometims means she is as ugly and uncaring as the icons she (apparantly) wanted to expose.But she rocks. 6'1"" is anthemic, nasty anthemic, and she just rolls from there.A great LP. Buy it."
1,"I'm conventional and sheltered, so sue me","I got this CD because I had heard it was awesome and contained an early Alanis-esque angst. um, not really. the first song wasn't bad, but it was slow. liz's voice isn't particularly good, or interesting. the rest of the songs pretty much sound the same. the only one I recognized at all was the beginning of dance of the seven veils.overall, I've only listened to this CD when I wanted background music. this is no goo goo dolls, beatles, jewel...the writing isn't particularly bad, but the music just puts me to sleep."
1,Debut of the Monotone Queen,"I bought this record entirely on the strength of an article in Rolling Stone which basically said this was a tough, ballsy record by a tough, ballsy chick. What it failed to mention is that she cannot sing one blessed note. I was in pain from the moment I strapped on the headphones. She has no range whatsoever. Why anyone pays her any attention whatsoever simply baffles me."
2,Boring,"Eh. It almost sounds like she's making her voice sound like crap on purpose. Like she's giving it some edge that doesn't need to be there. Plus, it's full of music my brother would just love, where it sounds like the primary influence for all the songs is a bass. Doo doo doo doo dee dee dee doo doo dee dee duh. I wish I knew music terminology better so I could explain what's missing. I think it's called a melody, but I can't be sure."
3,Don't always trust the crtics,"As a white male, I couldn't even pretend to appreciate the significance of a woman like Liz Phair taking on the white male-dominated establishment of rock. I'll leave that for the critics who get off on that sorta thing. While I can get hip to the whole response to Exile on Main Street vibe, I think Exile In Guyville is decidedly average. There are some good tunes here; there are some not so good tunes. You want sociological significance and good songs by women, check out the last two Hole albums. Then again, word is that Kurt Cobain and Billy Corgan were the forces behind those two albums. Spoken like a true white male."
4,Almost a five...,"I first gained interest in Liz after hearing the catchy(but overplayed)""Why Can't I?"" on the radio. Then, I heard she used to be an indie rock queen, and after reading all of the five-star reviews on here, I decided to buy it. My first reaction was: What a monotone voice! I'm so dissapointed! But I started listening to the lyrics closer. I decided my money hadn't been wasted after all. The best songs are: Help Me Mary, Glory, Canary, Mesmerizing, #### and Run, Girls Girls Girls, Divorce Song, Flower, Johnny Sunshine, and Stratford-on Guy. ""Never Said"" seems to be a favorite of many people, but I find it mediocre. Take the Parental Advisory warning seriously, because she never edits her feelings. Sample Lyric: Every Time I See Your Face, I Get All Wet Between My Legs. But that can't mask the album's greatness. Buy It!"
3,"shut up and sing, dammit!","The first time I listened to this album, I was expecting an Ani album, and I was sorely disappointed; as has been mentioned, this is a Utah album, not an Ani album. However, these are still some great songs, and the only bad thing I can say about this and the other Ani&Utah show (""Fellow Workers"") is that Utah needs to shut up and sing - when he sings, he is much more enthralling; his speaking voice sometimes borders on numbing."
4,Ok Fast Shipping,Arrived great ! Fast! Just did not know if i needed to spend as much for expandable ones. Make sure your measure
2,Don't buy,Was not worth the price. It fall about and I had to glue it back together! I could have it better myself
2,"Incorrect size, poor construction","The description says 18"" by 23"", but thanks to poor construction it is 18.25"" deep, and what I was hoping to be a perfect fit ended up not fitting at all. I say poor construction because the joints are completely fitted/flush, and I can see nails in-between. I may try to fix it myself, or I may just return it, I haven't decided yet."
2,not well constructed,"One of the expandable sides of this drawer organizer fell apart after only a few months. I was able to glue it back together so it works fine now, but it's not well made for the price they charge. I'd go with a different brand."
2,Terrible craftmanship,The product is beautiful but in less than 2 months the two sides have become unglued. Like other reviewers I have to clean out my drawer and try to glue it back myself.
5,Love this!,it is good quality and the expandable nature allows it to fit in many different drawer sizes. I am happy that I bought this.
1,Shoddy Product,"When received, several of the slats were too short to fit properly and had staples sticking out the ends. There were staples sticking out from where 2 pieces of wood were joined in the extension portion. Total piece of junk. Only bright spot was the ease with which Amazon allowed me to return it for full refund."
2,Broken,"As I was unpacking the organizer, one side just fell apart before I even got the entire thing out of the box. Aesthetically appealing but definitely not well made."
5,Square Head Advantage,"Though costly in comparison to other clamps on the market, these are a joy to use. You don't need two thumbs to operate, just slide the head into place and crank the handle. The part I have to say I like the most is the square heads. You can lay a string of clamps across a bench for panel glue up and they all stay put. When the piece is clamped, you can set it aside and stand the whole thing up on edge out of your way. Rather than having to have a wall to lean it against, a little floor space can hold a great deal of panels while drying since they're all packed in together. The clamping mechanism is very effective, and the plastic seems to resist most everything I've spilled on it (glue, lacquer, etc.) and clean up easily."
3,Topic Overload,"This is a noisy novel with so much going on it's hard to find a clear pattern. There's VR, Artificial Intelligence, cloning, genetic engineering, and of course not to mention all the post-apocalyptic standards. This thematic lack of cohesiveness also carries over the stucture of the book which is told disjointedly from various points of view. I only found one of the characters interesting at first, but by the end she too became predictable. It's not all bad though, the subjects although random, are interesting. This was the first Sagan book I read, so perhaps it works better after Idlewood."
3,slow beginning,"The writer tries to present this in several different alternating first-person voices. The biggest plot hole (after the first 100 pages) has been the teenage character named Penny who is apparently obsessed with money (the name is way too obvious) but the unexplained questions of how money could be used in a depopulated world really gets to me. After 100 pages... I'm about to give up. UPDATE: On some advice, I read a bit further and the explanation of money I wanted is on page 115. I'm still a bit bored, but I'm giving the book another chance.UPDATE: It picked up a bit. The plot developed, I was entertained for a while. IMHO, it would have been helped if the action started earlier."
2,Not what I expected,"I love science fiction, but found this book hard to get into. I almost stopped reading it several times. The characters are not well developed, and they lack richness of personality. They all seemed a bit flat.The story idea is creative and interesting, but not as well told as it could have been. I found the 'diary' approach of going from one character to another somewhat stilted and hard to follow. The dialogue between characters was limited in it's scope and depth.Instead, I would recommend books by Sharon Shinn and Kristen Britain."
2,Put me to sleep,Nearly gave up on this book. Boring & rambling (and I've read SF for most of my life).
5,Nick Sagan rocks,"This is the second book in the series, I would definitely recommend reading the first one first (Idlewild). Sagan doesn't try to make his writing pretty nor does he sugar coat the story with convoluted stories of love. His writing is raw and to the point."
5,Signal looks great,Used this to run my TV across my room. The signal looks great and I like the thinness of the RG59 over the RG6
4,Coax Cable,"Standard Cable, works great! We bought it for length as our old cord wasn't long enough. No cons that I can think of."
4,Wonderful text for review,This is one of the best neuropathology texts available. It is well written and concise. I like the descriptions and pictures. Some other texts out there take a very numerical approach with numbered lists of everythig which may be OK for test taking but which do a poor job of explanation and do not impart an overview.
5,Enjoyable and informative,It's well written that you enjoy every word of it and gain lots of information. It's the best for a resident to understand the world of surgical neuropathology.
3,Use as a supplement to another cookbook,"I got this book as a gift and occasionally refer to it as a supplement to my other Vietnamese cookbooks. Sometimes, the recipes are a bit off (as in not 100% authentic). However, it does contain some good recipes. Improvements could be made by adding a picture and the Vietnamese name of each dish."
3,easy to hit start/stop button accidentally,I am a soccer coach and intended to use this to manage soccer games.The stop/start buttons are too soft and the watch stops or starts accidentally.
3,Not kitschy or ridiculous enough,"As a fan of MST3K, I thought this would provide an evening of distracted laughs. It did not. When people see your DVD collection, this might add some interest and depth, but as far as actually viewing it, you might want the internet and some checkbook balancing activities to do."
5,you won't believe it,"I've been a Little Feat fan for 25 years now and I found ""Ain't Had Enough Fun"" yesterday in a second hand CD & black records shop, here in Strasbourg (France), for 11 $. Amazon does help you a lot when you're far from the main source, but going to check things in shops is still much fun, here, in the old world.+AM8-"
5,More Great Music From The Worlds Most Underrated Band,"Little Feat truly returns nearly to the form of the Lowell George era with this fine collection. The band returns to its blues roots with many fine tunes such as Romance Without Finance, Caddilac Hotel, and Rock N Roll Everynight. New Vocalist, Shawn Murphy definitely makes her presence felt on the above mentioned tunes and many other songs. Its just a total injustice that a great band like this can not get enough due recognition while many talentless rappers and grungers put out incomplete limited interpretations of music and that sells."
4,EXCELLENT PLAYING SEARCHING FOR A FEW MORE GREAT SONGS,"A LONG TIME FAN OF LITTLE FEAT FINDS THIS PROMISING BUT STILL MISSING THAT MAGIC OF DIXIE CHICKEN, OR FEATS DON'T FAIL ME NOW. BUT I PLAY IT MORE THAN A LOT OF OTHER STUFF I HAVE. TRY IT YOU'LL LIKE IT."
4,Say You'll Be Mine,"Another great song by British Hist sensation Steps. The song's a bit different if you compaire it to their other songs because here you'll hear all 5 Steppers sing! And yes they really can sing, all 5 of them!!! It's a great uplifting song (and they've made a fanatastic video for it too). If you here this song, I'm sure you want to buy the album too (at least if you don't allready have it of course)"
4,Gripping Sequel,"Mr. Matsuoka certainly didn't disappoint. Many authors lose momentum when they write a sequel and it doesn't stay on par with the first book. That is not the case with Autumn Bridge. Just as mysterious and gripping as Cloud of Sparrows. Again, I found myself unable to put the book down. It will keep you guessing up until the end. Don't make any any assumptions. He will surprise you."
5,A stunning sequel,"It is with much eagerness that I await what might come next from Matsuoka's creative mind. Both Cloud of Sparrows and Autumn Bridge were such rich and vivid works...I often felt transported to the waning days of Japan's feudal age, to the solemnity of discipline and aesthetics, to the very rooms in which his wonderful characters existed. Autumn Bridge succeeds in an often difficult format - jumping between decades and then centuries to weave the steel-meshed ties between bloodlines and prophecy. There are enough subtle plot twists to keep a person guessing, and enough substance to the legacy of his Lord Genji to keep the reader loyal. Simply, this is a beautiful and powerful novel."
2,AUTHORS: Attempting to insult your readers is NOT suggested,"In seeking to develop my own grant writing course, I reviewed 20 books on Amazon. I was sold on this one by its extremely high Amazon.com Sales Rank...probably the highest of this category.Nevertheless, I was shocked and taken aback by a comment on the introduction page, that harkened back to my eighth-grader days: ""You'll learn that in grant writing you especially need to cultivate two abilities: meeting deadlines and following directions.""Despite the obvious comprehensiveness of the materials presented in the book from Ms Burke-Smith's experience, I don't know who's responsible for the talking-down attitude presented here.This is my first EVERYTHING title, and I don't know if all EVERYTHING titles are like this, or if it's from award-winning business writer Ms Tremore.All I know is after getting such an Introduction, what reader would wish to proceed into the book's depths with that kind of attitude by one's hoped-for mentors?"
2,Not Quite What I thought I was getting,This book is okay for an organization trying to funds for businesses and such. The title of this book was misleading to me by saying (Everything Series). I was looking for help for an elderly family on a very limited income who needs major home improvements. This book has not helped me in finding them the help they need at all. A little disappointed!!!!!!!!!!
2,Meh.,This part number is supposedly 24# paper. Feels close but not quite when comparing to others. NOT recommended for laser printing. These crease and fold like no other when used in a laser printer. If you just need regular envelopes though they should be fine for you.
3,OK but not great,"I would call this so-so. It was OK, nothing special. Now that I've bought it, I would not discard it, but if I could travel back in time, I would not buy it."
4,"""you love to hear the story, again and again...""","yes!!! this is the most obscure, uderground marley cd, period! the one you heard of, but never heard! this one has ol' skool rare classics featuring; grand master caz (of the cold crush bros.),M.C.Poet a.k.a. PHD, a.k.a thug poet, a.k.a. black poet) rockwell noel (old skool mc from queens bridge) spoony-g, funk master wizard wiz, etc. an old skool fiend and collectors must have!"
5,Whats on the CD?,"Well I know this for sure this might be the greastest old school hip hop album ever to be released. I hope Marley Marl adds on tracks with Crig G, Roxanne Shante, MC Shane, and many other from Queensbride. He should add tracks from Mobb Deep, Nas, and former member from the Juice Crew. Marley Marl hs never put out a wack album yet. If this can top Marley marl in control Vol. I it's a classic."
4,Flawed but Beautiful,"Killing Joke have never been ones to tone down their angry political views, but never before have they been brought to the forefront as on this record. Democracy opens with the brutal ""Savage Freedom"" picking up steam until the ear-shattering climax. This sets the stage perfectly for the rest of the album: violent, shredding guitar, vicious percussion and above it all, the hoarse shout of Jaz Coleman's vocals. The biggest suprise is the title track, which begins with sparkling acoustic guitar and reaches anthemic heights with the classic chorus, ""Sorry, democracy is changing."" Of course, it doesn't always work, as on the overlong ""Prozac People"" and the simplistic ""Intellect,"" but these are small nits to pick on an otherwise violently beautiful album."
2,I'd almost rather listen to Outside the Gate!,"After loving their last two albums, I was grossly dissappointed by Democracy. It sounds too dense, too ponderous, and too boring to be considered a four star CD. If you really want to listen to a good representation of Killing Joke, buy Fire Dances or Extremities. Avoid this one as your first taste of Killing Joke. You might not come back for more"
2,BRITISH POLITICS,"Killing Joke's mix of heavy metal and melodic pop hooks fuel ""Democracy"" into a confused, rather bland set of songs that seem a mix of '70s 'Boston', 80's 'The Cult', and 90's grunge, never identifying itself as the dark post punk distinctive Brit sound Killing Joke is alleged to be, but instead revealing a swirl of many hard rock ideas unfortunately anchored in an '80s time capsule where the beat goes on and on but never seems to get anywhere. The songs too often use the same formula of a grunting hard-edged vocal transforming into a lighter melodic sing-song soft core voice with vibrating 'Cult' guitars and repetitious, thump, thump, bang, bang, drums that clumsily combine punk with melody. They seem capable of more and a good Producer could have trimmed the clutter and the repetition in a more pronounced vision of social politics, which seems to be the aim here."
5,Among the BEST!!!,"We have the Baby Einstein DVD set and this one seems to be the favorite, though they are all great. There is a excellent incorporation of music, objects, indroduction to classic Van Gogh paintings, children and puppets, all relative to learning colors. My son LOVES this video and for good reason. I can't recommend the Baby Einstein line of videos enough."
3,"Not a 30 minute video, I'm afraid","While all the Baby Einstein videos clock in under 30 minutes, this one is the worst, essentially lasting only 23 minutes. The rest of the video identifies the children and the puppeteer featured, and briefly shows the Van Gogh paintings once more. What content there is is nice, and my toddler does watch it, but it would be better if it actually lasted the 30 minutes stated on the cover.As many have noted, the Baby Mozart tape is the best one this company makes. However, one plus is that there are fewer toys on this tape and more real world images. Thus, you don't get the sense that your child is seeing an extended toy commercial."
2,Too much repitition!,"I bought the entire 10(or was it 12) pack of BE videos. It is such a waste- 60% of the content in each dvd comes from the other dvds. If I had 1 or 2 of them I would have been satisfied, but i feel as if I have basically 2 dvds worth of content on 10 discs. On to Brainy Baby!"
5,My baby girl loves this video!,"We have purchased 5 of these videos and my 11 month old absolutely loves them! She has been watching them since she was 2 months old and still loves all of them. We recently purchased the Baby Doolittle videos and these are great for her age. The colors, beautiful music, and quick pace of all of the videos are great to keep the attention of an active baby. They are also great to put on in case mommy needs to take a phone call or even a shower! I would recommend these to anyone with a baby...they are wonderful and educational. I can't say enough good things about them...I guess the way I show I love them is to buy the videos for friends and family with infants and toddlers."
5,Mesmerizing!,"This DVD is mesmerizing just like every other Baby Einstein video collection, and my baby can sit there and not even notice anything or anyone around him while he's watching."
4,Mission Accomplished,My daughter is 10 months old and LOVES this video. From start to finish this video keeps her attention and illustrates colors with lovely Van Gogh artwork.The only drawback or area I'd suggest improvement is on the bonus materials. Baby Einstein should really just do away with this concept if they're not going to put time into what they're providing.
3,"Good, but not great.","I thought this movie was good but not as good as I had hoped and not as good as other Baby Einstein movies we've purchased previously. It's only about 23 minutes long and doesn't include as many of the great extras some of the other movies have. My son loves the puppet shows and the ones here just weren't as ""fun"" for him. I also was disappointed that they seemed to spend less time on each color as the movie progressed."
2,Received the wrong DVD.,I bought this DVD used for my 4 month old and was so excited when I received it but discovered that I had the wrong Baby Einstein video in the case and the one they sent me is for at least a 1 yr old. I didn't have the energy to even send it back. Oh well......
2,Would NOT recommend,"I recently bought the Baby Einstein Van Gogh DVD (""NEW"") as a gift for my son's Easter basket. The DVD came shipped in a plain black DVD case- no pictures, no title, not one thing on the outside of the case. It also came unwrapped. No cellophane or plastic wrap at all. There's no way to determine if this item is new or used, plus there's no way to tell what DVD it is when it's sitting on a shelf as there is no labeling of any kind. Needless to say this would be an eye sore in my son's Easter basket. Not impressed."
3,Not as good as others,"It looks like I'm in the minority for my review on this one, but here it goes anyway. My daughter has been captivated by Baby Mozart, Beethoven, and then Old MacDonald and Neighborhood Animals. But she does not seem at all interested in this video. I thought it was interesting the way it presents art and colors. As she gets older and we talk about colors and she learns to identify the colors, this video may complement the educational experience. But until she can do this, it is back on the shelf."
5,Love it!,"After reading the reviews on Amazon I decided to purchase this video for my 15 month old son. We recently purchased a vehicle with a DVD player and let me say this video is a life saver. Imagine driving in the car every day with a child that screams his head off. Not for any reason, but he hates to be strapped down. This video actually holds his attention, which is minimal to say the least, and a happy baby equals a happy mother."
4,Fun & Engaging,"My favorite of the Baby Einstein collection. Couples colors with words, music and poetry. I anticipate it will be one my son enjoys for some time to come."
1,Baby Einstein DVDs Are Some of Worst Baby DVSs!,"I have bought 30+ baby/infant DVDS from different production companies, such as the ""So Smart"" series, the ""Brainy Baby"" series, the ""Your Baby Can Read!"" series, and the Nite Light ABC DVD. Baby Einstein DVDs are the lowest in quality, cheap toy props, boring music, nothing stimulating. I would recommend the So Smart DVDs and the Brainy Baby DVDs. Your Baby Can Read! are OK, not very high tech, but it could work."
4,Fun DVD,"Both of my kids loved the baby einstein collection and so did I. It started entertaining both my daughter and son at very early ages which gave momy a little break! However they are a little pricey compared to most videos, they really should come down on the price that way more familes can enjoy these movies."
3,The content is too good. But the Disc ??,"Five Stars for the content and ZERO star for the DVD disc.The content on this DVD was too good and my 2 year old daughter never took her eyes off it. It was an enjoyabale view for the parents too. The colors were very good and the background music was also fantastic.But one problem is that after viewing it for around a month now, we are experiencing some long ""reads"" and ""pauses"" while the player is trying to play. Either the DVD disc recording is not upto the mark or else my player decided to scratch this particular disc alone !!!And - for those who say that it is very repeatable, my answer is that it has got to be repeatable. Else it is going to take a longer time for the little ones to learn it."
4,My 6 month old loves it!,"It keeps her very entertained with colors, music, and sounds. Very educational and will definitely buy more from Baby Einstein!"
5,Baby Einstein,Can't go wrong if your child loves these videos. My grandson watches them over and over and over and over......
4,World of Colors -,My 4.5 month old is watching this one and loves the fast paced music and the vivid colors. So far one of the best of eight that I have bought
2,World of Colors,"We own alot of the Baby Einstein products. Our son really enjoys watching the DVD's. Recently we purchased Baby Van Gogh- World of Colors, I have to say, this one is our least favorite! Some of the sound effects are so loud they scare my son! On each color they have a poem, well, you have to turn your volume way up to hear what they are saying! If you forget to turn it back down, the sound effects are even louder!! I would not recommend this DVD unless you really feel you want to purchase it for your child! Though it would be nice to introduce your child to color, I would recommend finding another type of movie to do so! Unless you want to sit with your child each time he/she watches this with the remote on hand to keep turning the volume up and then back down! It just frustrates me, so needless to say, we don't watch this one!!"
5,Wonderful!,Our 9 month old baby boy loves this video/dvd. We have Baby Bach (his favorite of the bunch) Baby Mozart (not as in to that one) and Baby Van Gogh (loves this one almost as much as Baby Bach. He will watch it straight for a good 15 minutes so that I am able to jump in the shower and know that he is safe and happy. Great Christmas present for those expecting or with a little one.
1,Ick,"I haven't decided yet if this one or the one about shapes is my least favorite. I agree, all Baby Einstein is is a bunch of toys floating across the screen - however, some of them are put together in a way that is educational and fun for my 9 month old son. I've been showing him the Baby Einstein videos since 3 months (and I have reviewed all the ones we own). Like previous reviewers have said, the poems are ridiculous and the way Julie reads them is horrible. I know these are supposed to be ""teaching aides"" as opposed to a distraction for mom to get away, but I know most moms use these as a way to take a quick shower or get some dishes done, therefore, the toys they float across the screen don't really have any learning purpose (pointing out the colors or having poems that deal with ""real world"" items in that specific color would be more effective). I do like the Van Gogh prints they show, and that's about it."
2,Sound Modulation Problems,"The visuals of this video are fair, though not up to par with those of Baby Dolittle. The sound truly [stinks]. Overpowered by accompanying music, Julie-Aigner-Clark's poems come off as nearly-inaudible babblings."
3,Not one of their best...,"We had the baby sign language version and had much higher expectations, as it pertains to content. It's good for a few views but I'm not certain that my little ones got much out of it. Great music and visuals just not sure it is effective."
4,Baby Van Gogh,"By far the most entertaining of all the Baby Einstien videos that we own. My son has like this video since he got it when he was 6 months old and he is now 15 months old. The video is educational, it teaches colors and associates the colors with real life objects. Also the music the video is set to really has turned my son on to classical music which is wonderful. At least I feel better showing him this video than showing some of the other videos out there that are less educational and more mindless tv."
5,A good classic puppet format,"While I hate to admit it, my 8 month old is hooked on Baby Einstein. His favorites are Baby VanGogh, Baby McDonald, Numbers Nursery and Baby Shakespeare--i.e., all the classical puppet format types. Baby VagGogh is a sort-of introduction to colors, and after seeing it dozens of times my baby still smiles at his favorite puppets. I've researched the BE series thoroughly, and highly recommend these titles. While I am not crazy enough to think the videos will make my little one smarter, I do like that I know what he's seeing, I get a few minutes to shower, cook, etc, and most importantly, he loves them!"
4,"Fabulous, for any age","The box says this is for 1+ or so, but our 4-month-old loves it. Sure, the names of the colors are beyond him, but the assembly of images emphasizing each color, rolling one color after the other, fascinates him. So, don't be deterred by the suggested age."
5,Another good one,"This is another good Baby Einstein selection, and I think it's probably even more interesting now for my 20 month olds than it would have been before. We have several others, but the boys didn't like the ""teaching"" ones as well as the just music - Galileo or Neptune with the nature scenes didn't used to cut it for them. They much preferred the Beethoven that didn't have sections beyond the different symphonies.Now, though, that they can identify items and some of the colors, they really are into this one. The paintings are lovely, of course, but so are the images used to convey the colors in everyday life.I know some reviewers are turned off by all the shots of the kids, but my kids seem to like seeing those scenes. They also really are enjoying the animal/nature scenes now that they can point and say the words more often.The music is rousing and fun.All in all, another excellent addition to the set!"
4,sound problems,"This is a great product; introduces the child to colors with use of different objects (which you can name while you're watching with the baby-helps language) has very nice music and also introduces some of Van Gogh works, BUT, the sound quality is REALY REALY BAD. There are some poems read during the program but it is not audible at all."
4,Good but marred by ads,"The video itself is great, but I find it abhorrent that it begins and ends with ads (for other products by the Baby Einstein company). If some Disney really felt that they had to include ads, they could easily have added a menu choice offering information on their other related products. But no, they placed a video announcement for these products right within the play -- as the first thing you see after selecting play, and the last thing after the video itself ends. So you'll get to hear those ads each and every single time you play the DVD."
3,Good,"My daughter actually likes the very beginning of the show, and then loses interest...but that is probably typical for her age. Otherwise not a bad product."
3,Mixed Feelings,We have many Einstein dvds and I do like this dvd because it introduces my daughter to colors and I follow up w/playing and naming the color of toys during our playtime. She seems to like the video but when it comes to the poems you cannot hear them at all so she gets nothing out of that.
4,Entertaining baby video,"My daughter has been watching this one since she was 4 months old and still loves it at 10 months. She loves the puppets and toys. My only issue with it is the volume. For each color, there is a vignette featuring a puppet with a voice-over of a poem about the color. It is impossible to hear the poem unless you really crank the volume up. All other sounds (background, sound effects, and music) are normal."
1,Insulting. Speaks down to kids,I find it ironic that the title has Einstein in it when it clearly assumes my child is an idiot. It's almost shameful how this company intimates that they are somehow educational.
1,Real world is better,Please be aware that the fact is The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under two be kept away from screen media. These products are claiming benefits that are utterly unfounded.
2,Very disappointing:-(,"My 2 year old boy is just starting to learn his color so we bought this DVD to assist us in teaching him. We have several other Baby Einstein DVD's and this is probably my least favorite. It is supposed to help children learn their colors, but all it basically does is show a bunch of toys and objects that are of various colors without repeating what the color is. For example: It will say/show the word ""yellow"" and then spend a few minutes showing some yellow things, playing some music and reciting poems (really lame ones, by the way, that have nothing to do with colors). My child is ""entertained"" by the video at most, he will watch it, but has learned nothing from it. I was hoping it would be more like the shapes dvd, that one REALLY helped my toddler learn his shapes!Not worth the money at all. I highly recommend NOT buying it."
4,Great fun for baby!,"My baby is almost four months old, and the first time she saw this DVD she was fascinated. She watched the entire ""theater"" portion from start to finish! The images and sounds fascinated her. The one downside is that the fast forward and skip functions don't seem to work, so you can't watch part of the section in one viewing and part later. Still, this is a great value."
5,cool!,Having a little sister sister who tattles and spies is tough enough. But wendy's little sister Katie isn't just a pain... she's perfect. Katie does everything well: her walls are covered with awards and medals. Wendy feels like a total failure next to the pest. Why can't wendy do something right for a change?
2,Not recommended,"I'm sorry I can't be as glowing as the other reviewers. This is the worst ""guide"" book I have owned. Some basic facts are incorrect, maps are unreadable and very small. More information is given through the park service - and it's free!"
4,This little book made our vacation to the Dunes a delight.,"We used the guide book to plan the ""hike of the day"" and saw more of the Park than we ever would without it. We enjoyed the story on the U.S. Life-Saving Station and were able to witness a re-enactment of a rescue. This book is a gem."
1,"Overly wordy, minimally encouraging","The author states that the purpose is to encourage the readers by showing what current, high-level, Christian leaders are doing (p. xii). However, there is much more about his own thoughts than on what others are doing. And his thoughts are so boringly basic. In fact, I found it very hard to stay awake while reading this book. I am presuming that someone reading this has a (relatively) clear view of Christ in that it's the first word of the title. If you can't figure out on your own that Christ would value people, then read this book. Otherwise, move on to something more helpful, inspiring, or convicting."
4,Fine assortment of pre-modern ani,"Well, if you've heard Ani doing the disco/ska thing on LPC, and heard her live on LIC (or stage if you're lucky), get a load of this! Early stuff, which raised Ani from the talented clubsinger to the talented well-known clubsinger she is today. Much blunter (but still very listenable) edge. Many tracks, much emotion, and a good smattering of politics. Personal favourite: Roll With It - should have had airtime during the Gulf War."
4,Decent clamps!,"I have half a dozen of these clamps in my shop and I think they are decent little clamps. Being steel, they are very sturdy and I have found the spring/jaw tension to be excellent. Though I don't use them all the time, at times I find myself with a clamping need that only these clamps can satisfy. The only reason that I am not giving these five stars is because over time the rubbery-plastic tips on the jaws (that protect your work) tend to work loose and slide off. This can be a bit annoying. Other than that one minor complaint, these are good clamps that I have had a lot of success using. If anything, these 3"" clamps are an even better value than the 4"" version."
1,I'd give it 0 stars if I could,"These arrived today fulfilled and shipped by Grady. The springs on these clamps are so strong that I could not open them using BOTH HANDS. My husband had to use both of his hands to open them. They also are HUGE! There was nothing in the listing to indicate this issue, which I consider to be misleading and even false advertising. Grady (the seller through Amazon) said they would give me a refund but that I have to pay shipping both ways and that would cost MORE than the price of the clamps. Seems unfair to me, when there was nothing in the listing to indicate the problem."
3,Good Price but less Ink !,Very good price indeed but I notice that each cartridge does not have as much ink as the original cartridge. Ink quality is ok. I would still recommend the product because it is really very cheap.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Product was a good price & arrived in good condition. I was pleased with this order & thought it was a good purchase until I realized that my information was stolen as a result of this purchase. I have been ordering from Amazon for quite some time & have never had this experience. Luckily, precautions were in place & the incident is being investigated. Sadly, the price was too good to be true...will not be purchasing from this supplier again."
1,These are not LC51,These are listed as LC51 but are not the same. The nozzle end is missing two major pieces. My printer is an MFC-465NC and these would not work in it. My printer requires LC51 cartridges. I hate that I did not take a picture of them before returning them so potential buyers can see what I am talking about. The listing does not show the nozzle end of the cartridge. On some printer models this may not be an issue. There are other ones on Amazon.com that are LC51 that I have purchased before and they work. I was not able to find them again until now. They can be found here:16-Pack US Patented Compatible Ink Cartridges for Brother LC51 MFC 230C 240C 350C 440CN 465CN 3360C 5460CN 5860CN 665CW 685CW 845CW 885CW
5,great ink,this product was all i expected it to be great and was sent in a timely manner. great quanty for the price. i will be ordering from this company from now on all my ink needs. thanks i love t.
5,Great Buy on Ink,I've been using the ink now for about 3 weeks. It's worked great and you just can't beat the price.
5,Ink for Brother printer,"I have to admit we were concerned about buying discounted ink for our printer, but this has, so far, been an incredible find. It's absolutely absurd that the cost for printer ink has skyrocketed, but this ink has been great!"
5,Great PRODUCT & COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am a first time buyer from this company. I have to say that the ink toners work perfect for me. I don't have any complaints at all. Fast service, reliable. I would highly suggest ordering from them again. I know I will.."
4,Brother Ink cartidges bulk set,This is exactly what I have been looking for. Individual cartridges in a set that did not cost an arm and a leg! There is no compatibility problem and the printer took them without complaint. Will have to wait and see if they last longer (or at least as long) than the Brother product. Would be five star if I had any information on the longevity. So far.....very satisfied with this product.
1,1 out of 10,LC51 replacements did not work. I got one of the 10 cartridges to print. Black also keeps getting stuck in the cartrige compartment.
3,not happy,I have ordered these several times before and this set did not work - did not read in printer. Ink cello punctured and seated correctly but says no cartridge in printer
4,Excellent color and value,"I cannot notice a difference between these and the original inks, my printer is cheap, and the OEM ink is pricey, so using these makes sense. I think I could probably buy a new printer for the price I was paying for OEM inks. These are cheaper than the rewards you can get for recycling, that makes them a very good investment, even if you don't use them after the first round, you can cash in on them at your local office supply store. The only issue I have with these is the tendency to leak hen I am pulling the empty ones out of the printer. you just have to be careful. The good news is that the ink is water soluble so it cleans up pretty easily even if it does spill, it's just an inconvenience."
1,disappointed,This product is a waste of money. The cartridges do not fit the brother mfc-790cw as it states. The worst thing is that there is no recourse to recover your money.
2,"""LC51"" may not be the ""LC51"" you need...","The description of this product says that it is ""Brother Compatible"" and the numbers LC51 are the numbers of the original Brother cartridges... Simple, right? Not exactly.I don't understand why any manufacturer would make ink cartridges and label them with numbers that tend to confuse or even mislead. The item number and description led me to place the order but it was only after I received and actually compared them that I realized these won't work for me. After another check of the item on the Amazon.com product page it STILL appeared to me that I had ordered the right thing - but, after finding and following through the (small) link - I found that my model is NOT among those listed.I can't speak to the quality of these - they may be fine in the right model - but the price seems reasonable... Just make sure these are these are the ones you need!"
2,Color was great but wrong Black shipped!,The color cartridges are perfect - no problems - but the Black cartridges are the wrong model! Not compatible with LC51! I didn't notice until I had used the color cartridges and opened one Black one. Hopefully the Seller will make it right for me somehow!
2,Moody,"I was impressed with the price, but not the product. These cartridges work when they want to, not always when you want them to. I have taken the BLACK inparticular out and reinstalled a number of times so the printer can clean it in hopes it will print right. I would not recommend these cartridges unless you don't have enough drama in your life already. They will certainly add the drama of having printing dead lines and be faced with the fickleness of their performance. They're great when they work- but note- when they work. No consistency."
1,No consistancy with these,"I placed an order for these Nov 3rd, 2011, they worked great, exactly the same as genuine Brother except much cheaper. The cartridge was the same, no difference. I found a deal, or so I thought.Now it's April 8th, I need more black so I clicked back to my original order in 2011, clicked the product and bought another package. The same picture and description as before but the product is totally different. These cartridges are physically different than a LC51, there are no tab bosses to align in front.The previous order were all individually boxed, these are just stuck in a plastic bag.I blame Amazon for not being consistant with what they offer for sale. Its a bait and switch.Its a joke."
1,Disapointment,Cyan cartridge arrived without the customary stick on seal and my printer gives an error signal that states the ink is running low.
3,Not the same quality as brother ink but the price was right,"The item arrived promptly and as described. The black ink cartridges were a different style/brand than the color. All of the inks have been replaced. I've had some issues with print quality. For about 1 1/2 pages the black printed in streaks. Also, after I changed the Cyan my color was off. I popped the cartridge out and reinserted and it was much better after the printer went through a cleaning cycle. If these are the issues that I continue to have, I would purchase the item again since the price was so good. The printer is used for home printing."
1,Not Compatible w/ MFC-440CN,"Do not purchase these for your Brother MFC-440CN. The color cartridges appear to fit but do not seem to work, and the black cartridge is the wrong size and gets stuck in its receptacle. The cartridge labels clearly say they are for the MFC-440CN, but they're not compatible."
4,"horrible fitment, but the product works","I bought these instead of buying the ""oem"" cartridges from 10 times the price. I was skeptical to use no name cartridges but decided that for the price it was worth a shot. Installation was straight forward, though the black was a completely different size/shape than the one I pulled out. The holes on the inside did line up and the cartridge was able to click into place. I first went into the dashboard to check supply levels and while the black and magenta are full, the yellow/blue were at roughly 80%. My first test page printed fine.I'll try to update the review when I've used the printer some more."
1,"Not Right item, Not as Advertised !!","Not impressed at all !! I have a Brother MFC-240 C Multi Function Printer that takes the LC51 Cartridge. When the Shipment came, it was only four Cartridges and they wont even fit my Printer. Not worth the cost or Pain to send back. I personally would not recommend this seller to my WORST Enemy. Totally not what was advertised.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P8R8PC/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
1,Doesn't work,"Unfortunately these didn't work in my Brother MFC5860. They load fine, the printer recognizes a new cartridge is loaded but nothing prints. I changed all 3 color cartridges and nothing prints. Didn't realize the colors weren't printing until after the 30 day return window so I guess I'm stuck with them. Best thing about them is the cheap price.I installed a black cartridge and it does work so it seems my problem is only with the color cartridges."
4,very compatible,"very compatible, but I still have a full order box received. Printer broke, so I bought anonther one. It cheaper than repair."
1,Cartridge leaked,First cartridge leaked and lasted one week price was cheap but not if they don't last more than two pages .
2,box came rather crushed,"some were damaged in shipment, otherwise seems to print okay, it is not my main printer so does good for what was intended"
2,You get what you paid for,"It is only recently I ran out of my Brother cartridges and started using these. Well, lesson learned.In the beginning I had a few drops of black ink here and there, on my paper. After a while it stopped and worked normally. Today, I ran out of black ink again and had to change it. Well, surprise, surprise, when I pulled out the cartridge I ended up with ink all over the place. The cover, the floor, the table! What a mess!!I will not be buying this product again."
3,Caution,Great deal! Be careful changing cartridges they tent to leak when taking them out of the printer. I would still buy gain
4,Worth it,These inks actually worked better than the brother brand refills I have bought before at a fraction of the price.
2,I'm Bummed! Not completely Satisfied,"Delivery was good... When I took off the plastic covering to the colors, 1 set of the yellow and blue leaked on me. After inserting them into my printer, I tried to print and colors were not right. The black ink works but not the colors! I was bummed!"
1,Brother 51c ink cartridges,Bought these to save some money. Big mistake. Installed the first cartridge and it did nothing but leaked all over the inside of my printer. Ink seeped thru to everything. I had to replace the printer.
5,Quality ink at the best price,"I have been using these ink cartridges for about 6 month, and it's been working well. I've heard about some other brands clogging up the printer, but this brand has been great! I highly recommend this."
5,Saved a lot of money on Ink for my printer,I got the package in short order and all products were there. I got 10 cartridges and have used the black. It working fine. I expect the other colors to be just as good.
2,disappointed,"These cartridges did not work very well in my Brother all-in-one printer. Most of the cartridges would skip lines. This was after keeping them in a drawer for a year, but still before the expiration date."
4,Good customer service,"I ordered the LC51 Brother cartridges. Two of the ten cartridges were leaking in the individual sealed packages when they arrived. I had to place two calls to customer service, but they sent a brand new 10 pack to replace the two leaking cartridges. Then they called to make sure I got them."
1,Ink Cart for Brother MFC845CW,"The ink arrived in good order, but the ink or cartridges were poor quality. The blue leaked into the yellow and after several cleaning (about 20 machine and serveral manual cleaning) I finally just purchased a new printer locally. I would never purchase ink from this reseller again. They all stated LC51 which is correct but they didn't fit properly and most likely caused the blue spilling into the yellow. You get what you pay for, so by trying to save a few dollars it actually cost me a lot more in the long run. Look for a decent price on OEM equipment unless you like buying a new printers."
1,Product ordered was not product sent,"Sold as LC-51 (Brother) compatible ink, but was not the product received.Brother Compatible LC51 Bulk Set of 10 Ink Cartridges: 4 Black & 2 each of Yellow / Cyan / Magenta"
4,Laser,The laser was easy to install. It is battery powered or you can plug it in. It is light weight and adjustable.
1,Don't Buy,"The first problem I noted was it came not in a retail package but in a brown box. There were no instructions or paperwork of any kind. The next problem was finding a location to mount the device. The cable on. The AC adapter is only a couple of feet long so if AC isn't close to where you intend to mount it. Finally the biggest problem is the motion sensor doesn't work. The laser would come on briefly, bit no movement would trigger the laser to come on. After all the fiddling mine finally wound up in a box in my garage. I would never buy this product again."
2,A plodding tome of bureaucratic bungling,"Salmon , as a species , are no where near to being extinct, as this book would lead one to believe. Can we improve on the way we as U.S. Citizens treat our Environment? Certainly!!! Do we have the will to do it? Who Knows???"
1,Boring!,"Now maybe i should of realized that a even though i love Motorcycles, a game would be well...You know boring, lame, and poorly made, all of the above is true for this game. I recommend that you not waste your money on this.."
5,ministers tax and financial guide,"Zondervan publishes excellent books on a lot of subjects this is one of them , very helpful"
4,MCA BLEW IT BIG TIME,"A band this versatile to go by the wayside is a shame. Luckily Roadrunner stepped up. 1000 Yard Stare is pure and simple a great rock album. You can't really label this band because the sound is very unique. From the punkish ""Dressed In Light"" to the oddity of ""Vamp"", this album runs the gambit. Everything is laid out crisp and clean, yet the album is not laden with studio special effects and splicing. All in all a great band with a bright future."
5,Ushering in the New Millenium,"I had only heard a few samples and the radio play of 1,000 yard stare. That should have done it right there, but there was more. I saw these guys open for Queensryche the other night and they were even better on stage. They make you feel that you truly are a part of the music they perform. Get this cd and see them live, if you already haven't. rail_27@yahoo.com"
5,"""LEFT STUNNED and WANTING MORE! ""","NEVER, have I heard an album sound this good from start to finish. I first heard doubleDrive late night on my local rock radio station, at 3:30 in the morning on my paper route. The song I heard was their first single ""Tattooed Bruise (Here and There)"". I was blown away! The song was so good, I had to backtrack the houses I missed throwing a paper to, because I was too into the song! The next day I rocketed down to my local record store, and sure enough, it had only been out a week; just sitting there on the shelf just waiting for me to grab it. If you like straight forward ROCK & ROLL, then this is YOUR album. Great lyrics, with a frontman whos voice makes God nervous. Make sure you check out ""1,000 Yard Stare."" It's VERY much worth it!"
4,"Unique, but the same","Cool album. Good song writing.At first they sounded like every other 90's band. But after few listens, I saw dD for what they are - great song writers. I saw the band open for Queensryche here in Portland and they were very good live as well.FYI - there are alot of Queensryche fans talking about these guys. Queensryche opened some doors for dD. I'm excited to see dD evolve into a popular band. It's inevitable. They're too good not to be."
1,do not buy....,"this was difficult to put together. it's clear so you can see the hole you cut out in the door, not a good look."
5,This Book Changed My Life,"In 1977 I used the 1st edition of Indonesia Handbook (then called 'Indonesia, A Traveler's Notes') on a two-month backpacking trip around the archipelago. I sent Bill some reader feedback and we began corresponding. A year later I was ready to leave on a five-month trip around the Pacific and offered Bill some traveler's notes on the South Pacific for inclusion in his Indonesia guide as a kind of appendix. He answered 'no' and said a separate guide was in order, and that became the 1st edition of South Pacific Handbook published in 1979. Twenty years later my South Pacific Handbook is in its 7th edition and Bill is still over there in Southeast Asia doing what he was doing when we first got together. His handbook is a masterpiece to which all other guides to Indonesia are indebted and a copy should be on the shelf of anyone seriously interested in that great country."
3,Moon's Travel Guide Indonesia,"I have the 1995 edition of this excellent publication. It is similar to the Lonely Planet guide but is far superior in the detail about the culture- religion, arts, crafts, customs and history.I bought the same book, described on the Amazon website as NEW. One would assume that a new travel guide would be the current edition. I was extremely annoyed when the book arrived, to find that it was published in 1989!!! It is totally useless to me as a source of travel information. The advertisement did not, of course, have any reference to the year of publication, only stating that it was new.So my lesson is learnt. Ask!"
2,Puncak Jaya---a deadly Mt.,This guide is great except it lacked the depth of description I was looking for while researching for a new murder mystery I'm writing about a murder on this Mt.Murder on Everest (A Summit Murder Mystery)
2,A Book to Avoid,"While at first look this book may seem very well-written and detailed, describing many remote regions of Indonesia that other guidebooks ignore, much of the description of such remote places is obviously based on hearsay.When visiting many of those remoter islands/regions during my 4 years around Indonesia, I very often found that the exciting attractions (like traditional architecture or traditional cultures) described by this book simply did not exist!Having not been there himself, the author must just have made them up. :-)While the background information on better-known parts of the country is more accurate and worth reading, the fact that many parts of this book don't seem to have been updated for decades further reduces its value.So I would say that for background information the regional guides by Periplus are better, while for practical travel details get the Lonely Planet or Rough Guide."
3,Average for a Lucado book,"I read a lot of Christian books. Some stand out and are memorable, some aren't. This one follows in the latter category for me."
2,Supply Chain,The author strives to provide a blueprint for companies to provide better ways to supply and meet customer demands.
2,Beware reliability of power supply (based on earlier model 330),"I have been a big fan of these printers. I own one vintage unit from when they were CoStar LabelWriters, and 2 LabelWriter 330 units. I still love the functionality, BUT ... now both of my 330s (one at home, one in the office) have suffered power supply failures. Dymo's solution is to send them back for a $75 repair (each). That's a large fraction of the purchase price. The power supplies lived through the warranty period, but not much longer ... so the calculation you must make is whether a unit that lives just about that long is worth the purchase price.It is possible, of course, that current models are more reliable. Or not."
1,avoid dymo - period,"what is it about dymo - used to be an ok company. their tech support group tries, but their products just suck. my labelwriter 400 works for a few weeks under windows 7 and then just stops working. some knot-head in their product design group put a right-angle power plug on the bottom of the thing that pulls out. why? when i change labels i have to manually select 30252 - and so i go through this debug process from time to time.dymo - nice little company with products that have sucked as of late. dummy me, i own three of them.after uninstalling all dymo software, installing both versions of the software, and two driver versions (one x86) it seems to be working - for another month? Also, the labels I printed out for folders in my garage have faded - in less than a year.too many features mean that the things we used to take for granted in the old days can't be done at all."
1,"A useless, unreliable piece of junk",This worked OK for about a month then started double ffeding labels (and sometimes more). It had to have a power reset between printings. Then the labels started jamming under the roller. All in all a complete piece of junk and not worth one penny. The website help is useless.
5,nice edition to the family,"works very well and saves me alot of time in not having to go the post office for stamps and not be charged a monthly fee. haven't used the other options yet, but i expect they will work as well. great product!"
4,Very Good Printer for Home Use,"Does every as advertised. I had no problem installing or running this printer. The software included is sufficient for printing many types of labels. The only gripes I have is finding various labels, even Dymo has a back order on labels and the cost of spare spools ($10.00 each) to simply changing label rolls. Still overall it is a good little machine for the home or home office."
2,Wasn't much of a story,"When it comes to romances I tend to be really critical. Overall, I did not like this book. But I did enjoy it enough to finish (and only saying ""whatever"" a few times). I thought that both of the characters were rather immature. Yes it's a romance. But the constant rambling about how much Brandt lusted for Willow was a little overloaded. We have a murder to solve...but romping in the sack is much more important. And the murder...oh yeah...that was obvious...maybe I would've liked this book better if it had a little mystery to it."
4,3.5 stars for this Pinkerton Woman,"Very strong characters in this book. I really enjoyed the fact the woman was an agent for Pinkertons but I did think she ""gave in"" a bit too quickly for my standards. But overall a good fun read."
4,"while not for the faint of heart, Ani is beyond ordinary!","This double disc set is the essential Ani Difranco so far...I love her music and this set represents the best of it. Ani is best live I have to admit. I would have given it five stars but there is room for improvment here...I do find myself skipping over her commentary and spoken word stuff and quite a few of her slow songs but to each his own...she is a sincere voice in a world full of facsimiles. She is the real thing...and gives it her all. What more can you ask for? If you don't like it, I challenge you to top it!Choice tracks are: Firedoor, Gravel, 32 Flavors, In or Out, Outof Habit, oh there are tons more......check it out"
5,Former Alanis Fans - Ani is the Jagged Truth!,"This concert album is excellent. Just listening to it you get a real feeling for the power music can unleash.I was fortunate enough to have good friend suggested this album to me while we were discussing our mutual dissappointment with Supposed Former Infatuation Fiend. Listening to this and other albums from Ani I see why.Ani's music is raw, honest and unafraid. She isn't the product of a slick record company packaging campaign. In fact, from what I understand Ani's financial agreements cut around 90% of whole record company system. She's the real thing.Ani's music isn't following a trend. In this and other albums Ani sets the trend others try to copy, including perhaps a certain Canadian Tiffany Wanna-be."
5,Intimate and beautiful,"This album was my first introduction to the Music of Ani Difranco, and after hearing all of her other albums i still think that it is her best to date. on this cd are several of her most beautiful, thought provoking and artful songs, For me the real stand out is the Version of ""Both Hands"" recorded with the Buffalo Symphony, It adds new definition to an already incredible song. If you are new to the music of Ani, this album is a must have. truly one of the greatest Live albums of the last decade, and the true intimacy of her live shows transfers very well to this medium. Check it out, you'll be glad you did"
5,Oh what can i say? i adore her.,"Ani has long been a favorite of mine, and through these discs i am constantly reminded why. she bares her soul through her singing, her poetry, and her stage dialogue. it did take me some time to get used to the tone of her music, but once i dipped a toe into the ocean that is ani, i knew i could never look back. of all her albums, this and ""little plastic castles"" are so far my favorite. try this cd, listen half a dozen times, and if you don't love her by then, i am sorry for you."
5,Another amazing CD from the Righteous Babe herself!,"Living in Clip is, without question, my favorite Ani CD. That's quite a distinction, considering all her music is fabulous. There's just nothing like Ani live. Her guitar improvs are incredible, her voice is beautiful, and her intelligent lyrics are perhaps her strongest suit. A must for any Ani fan who doesn't have it, or for anyone who likes good music!"
3,Uneven but still a good live work.,"I think that this cd is over rated as a stunning live cd...its good but not that fantastic. She does do an amazing rendition of ""Amazing Grace""."
2,foul language,"I like Ani, but this CD is full of very foul language. I have two young kids and I can not comfortably play this CD when they are around. Its really too bad since there are good songs interspersed with the really foul ones."
1,blah pathetic,"Marred by heavy handed lyrics and a rediculously fake singing voice, Ani once again retells the same old cleche tales of gay love and self loathing. She's so good at picking the world around her apart, but what solutions does she offer? What poetic intuition beyond her own self obsession? This fatal conceit reaches heights dizzying enough to enduce vomiting when she starts her corney jokes. Suposedly a spokeswoman for the DIY ethos, Ani is no more then the co-opting of subculture to exploit a sellable image and hollow political posturing. If this is considered the poetry it's marketed as let me move to the Maine woods with a labrador and an inkwell. The album that turned your sweet thirteen year old sister bi in 95 and got her to dye and peirce something at the mall in the name of ""difference""... you too can buy into it. Girls: this isn't anymore empowering then Jewel. Be careful what you feed yourself. I don't care if your a pheonix... this is some lame Stuff. beware"
5,Such a diverse and beautiful collection of Ani's best!,"I love how this album is structured, fast and slow songs, happy, angry, and confused, mixed up in an album that will inspire you to face any day with your head held high as a woman. I love this album so much. Thank you Ani!"
1,They look different in live,"I bought these pillows and returned them back to Amazon the same day. The bad thing about them: they just don't look the same in live. The work is poor, they really look cheap! Good thing about them: I returned them to Amazon with no problem. Amazon sent me UPS shipping label and it went through with no additional charge! That is why I love to shop here! My advice is, go buy something else, these guys are UGLY."
5,love the style it amaze me!!!,"converse I think has the best slip on in the world,, they are so comfortable and no laces, easy to put on I wear it all the time, IN fact its the only thing I wear (just stack of boxes)<< navy and the white onesoverall it fits my style"
3,Navy?,when i bought this i was looking for BLACK converse but for some reason mine were blue but i didnt realize until after i had already worn them and it was too late. they were the right size although they did take some time to get on at first and then once they were worn a bit i didn't have to use my fingers to get them on. but overall i wasn't too happy about the color.
2,Poor sizing information,"The sizing advertised is all wrong.I wear a size 12 US ASICS, and a size 12 in Converse is 1-1.5 sizes too big. I had to give them away.I've learned from this encounter."
4,"All-Star, No Laces.","I love these shoes, they're extremely comfortable and they look great. They got here and they were a little big but that's what i wanted, a nice loose fit. When you look at these shoes close enough they almost look like a dark navy blue but other than that I've got nothing bad to say. I'd definitely recommend them, they're so easy to slip on and off. the convenience, style, and affordability of these shoes make them an awesome buy B]"
1,much larger than a normal size 10,I bought 3 pairs and they are to big for him. They seem to be running a size larger than marked
5,love them,My sons and wife had these and I always wanted a pair for myself. My go too knock around shoe now. I will order more.
3,"Love them, but they should be reinforced.....","I love these shoes, but they ripped after only about a month of wearing them 2 or 3 times per week. They ripped right along the line that the tongue is sewn to the body of the shoe. This should be reinforced for slip on's I think. Otherwise, I really really like the shoes, but they were a lot of money for something that didn't last all that long. I'm going to go back to laces."
2,"think Heraclitus, not Chuck","These shoes are not like your Chucks from back in the day. I had a pair of similar Converse branded all-hemp shoes previously which were far more durable. The first week of wear introduced a series of streamer threads splitting out from the 'shoestring' area. It is a design intention (a la 'cut-offs'). Looks pretty shaggy for new shoes, but some of the appeal is no doubt the show of impermenance. If you need shoes for everyday wear and you can't buy a new pair every month, I would go with a more durable shoe."
1,Boo,"I thought it would be great to get slip-on chucks, but these are imposible! i struggled for sooooo long each time i tried to put them on because the stitching comes up pretty high and decided to cut them a bit. Good idea, but didn't help at all. ended up chucking the chucks. boo"
5,Very fast service,"Thanks for the very fast service. i live in Europe and airline crew. I was in lax for 48 hours and ordered the all stars a bit late.But it was delivered in the hotel in 2 days, so i could take it with me to europe.Thanks a lot.this is the second time i ordered from you and i am very satisfied.Regards,Margreet"
5,Converse slip ons,I bought these for my daughter and she loves them. They are good quality and fit great.
4,Great 2 sizes Smaller,"I love these.. They're great to just kick around in and I was suprised how well they stay on. The only issue I had with them was that when reading the description, I believe it said they run a half size large for women. Being a man, I ordered my regular size, perhaps foolishly. They came and were way too big. I did some more research before returning them and heard that they seem to run 2 sizes large. The return process went quickly, and I recieved my new pair 2 days after ordering them."
4,My daughter is a chucks fan.,"There are some spots around the edges that aren't glued well. It looked different not having the black line around the toe... that wasn't anything a good sharpie couldn't fix. :)My daughter is a fan of chucks and has several pair. She likes the slip on kind, but maybe we should have gotten a 1/2 size smaller- they fit just a little different that the lace ups."
3,"I love the shoe, it just broke down far too quickly","I love this shoe, I live in NYC, its the classic urban sneaker, still, I was disappointed that after a month, it started to fall apart. I still wear these shoes, even though the sole is pulling away from the exterior rubber, I just don't do so in the rain. I'm not certain if I simply received a defective pair.The concept is great, no laces, easy on, easy off, and urban. Perfect for this Mama."
2,Converse Shoes,"I was not pleased with the product I received. Before I purchased the product I would have liked to have known that the colour black is not what you think! I still think I was sent the wrong colour shoes (they look like they're navy blue not black).When I emailed the company about this they ignored me and did not offer for me to send them back or anything, so I was not happy with them at all.I will not be purchasing from them again!"
4,Barbie in one of her most iconic early fashions,"Cutting a dramatic figure in a sexy black dress, Barbie looks every inch the sophisticated nightclub singer in this lovely 1960 fashion and doll reproduction.This 1995 repro set includes a recreated 1960 'Ponytail' Barbie (aka Barbie #3), wearing the much-beloved ""Solo in the Spotlight"", a strapless figure-hugging black gown made of metallic weave, with a netted fishtail frill. Matching black gloves, open-toed mules, and a purple scarf 'held' in her hand complete the ensemble. To add to the flavour of the nightclub theme, a plastic microphone is included with the dollstand, so Barbie can 'sing' to her heart's content!For one reason or another, this repro set has never appreciated much in value over the years. Thousands of these dolls were made throughout 1995-96, and most collectors have kept her boxed, so she's still very plentiful on the secondary market. A fun piece for the classic collector."
4,*-*-*-,"I had mixed emotions at first. Emotions is what keep me intrigued. This album does stir up the senses and I found it quite enjoyable. I seldom notice the technical work of the studio, but his people did some excellent mixing and know how to make stereo come alive. Not many like this crew around."
1,Don't buy this album!,"Show some respect for the legend Kool Keith, don't buy this album. It's a collection of practice runs and things that were never supposed to see the light of day. Ced Gee released this himself ...It was this type of perpetrating that prompted Keith and Tim Dog to hit the studio again and release an album simply titled ""ULTRA-Big Time."" You should buy that one instead and peep the original ""Keep it Real,"" a song targeting Ced Gee and advising fans not to buy his 'basement tapes.'Fun Fact; The cover of this album is a strange collage of obscure pictures put together in photoshop. Keith flipped when he saw a face on this album cover that he didn't even recognize. The guy was just as surprised to see his face on the album! Show Keith and Tim Diggity some love and buy the ""Ultra"" album instead. This is an illegitemate album. Keith is a perfectionist and he obviously isn't proud of this material. Don't buy it. ..."
4,THE UNHOLY DECEPTION,"I discovered this book after researching the book of Enoch and comparing it with the UFO evidence that is throughout the Bible. It is not a far stretch for me and I find the book to be much more than science-fiction. A wonderful subject (I am of course bias!)That said, I was a little unimpressed with the charactor development. (hence the 4 stars instead of 5)It just wasn't there. Except for the main charactor the people introduced in the first book were left right were they were. More details but not real insight. That is an editorial issue not a subject matter issue.The premise of the book is right on. It just wasn't ""deep"" enough given the incredible story line that was being dealt with. Someone who is not ""well read"" can easily enjoy this book. I wanted more.In the end the subject matter wins out to make a great (albeit somewhat shallow) story."
4,A Very Fine Collection,"I laughed often reading these limericks and was even inspired to write a few of my own. Asimov was a very lusty guy and I liked his effort more than Ciardi. This book was a competition between these two friends and colleagues and the premiss is very enjoyable, especially the introduction."
4,Were Bill Clinton and Jeffrey MacDonald separated at birth?,"The physical evidence against Jeffrey MacDonald is clearly laid out and presented in this intelligent and well written book. The enormous dedication and personal involvement of the author and everyone who was involved in the case is remarkable and very touching. The transcripts from the 1974 Grand Jury hearing and the trial in 1979 are indisputable and very powerful. MacDonald has never been able to explain the contradictions between his story and the evidence itself. Instead he resorts to name calling and sarcasm.It seems MacDonald will always have his groupies willing to defend him. As the 30th year of this tragedy approaches, I wonder if Colette, Kimmy, Kristy and their unborn son will ever be able to rest in peace."
3,up for new hearing,i have not read this book yet but plan to purchase it. I just read in the Army times that Macdonald is up for a new hearing next month. I had never heard of the story but the article mentioned the book name. just wanted to let those that have read the book know about the trial he is trying to get with new DNA evidence testing..
5,Absolutely incredible and compelling,Wonderful read. Well-written. Couldn't put it down. The word that comes to mind to describe the author is grownup. Loved every sentence.
5,"Very heart breaking, and over whealming","I have read the book several times and each time I find it more and more mind bogling. How can someone not think that he did it, is beyond me. I think that Joe McGinness did an excellent job at writing this book, and formed his opinion based on evidence that was presented to him. I think the Kassobs are the ones that truely brought Jeffery Mcdonaled to his justice. But I am interested in the aftermath of this case. I want to know if Jeffery has gotten the justice system to review the new evidence that has ""supposedly"" come to light. Also, I want to add that Joe McGinness is not the one who brought Mcdonnald to justice, the courts did."
1,fatal vision,Sadly this writing is exemplary of an overly excited case participant who clearly understands little of psychology and psychiatry...I am personally and professionally disgusted...Carol Shuman Ph.D.
3,Re-Read After Many Years,"I read this book when it was first published. I remember thinking how guilty he was. This time I made notes and found very little actual evidence that he committed the murders of his own family. Much of the book recites the testimony of three or four shrinks that gave their opinion as to his flawed personality. He is an overachiever and an egotist, but I'm not sure he is flawed enough to have killed a two and a half year old child so brutally. If he had a rage and killed his wife, why would he then kill the children? Even OJ didn't go that far.The book is good and well written. What a horrible crime."
3,Forgotten victims,"It reads like a trial transcript, and it's too much about how ""great"" Jeff MacDonald thought he was. I read nothing new that had not been written over and over again. Reasonable doubt... It's there. Guilty, Probably. Verdict: Let him have his new trial. He's old, he's been punished, whatever happened that Feburary night, it's still in his head and he can't leave that in his cell should he be released. Good read for a first introduction of this crime."
3,Good but enjoyed others better,"Fatal Vision is certainly an interesting story and Joe McGinniss is a gifted writer in this genre. I felt this was a little too long, but still worth reading."
3,Guilty as sin,"MacDonald, for some odd reason, has always had his supporters. These are the same people who could have served on the O.J. Simpson jury: completely out to lunch. This book isn't perfect, and Joe McGinniss is certainly not unimpeachable (after all, he's the man responsible for 'discovering' and encouraging Bret Easton Ellis' writing). What it comes down to is this (and I can't figure out how MacDonald's supporters downplay this): the guy was a Green Beret. His family was brutally slaughtered and he had minor wounds. Was he a complete and utter wimp who was physically unable to protect his wife and children (something I can't believe) or was he himself guilty of the killings? This book gives good background on the evidence used to indict and convict the pathological, narcissistic nobody, Jeffrey MacDonald."
3,Jeffery macdonald should be a free man,"As far as stories this book will scare the living daylights out of you, but the truth is that there were many mistakes made at that crime scene. If that jury would have seen all of the evidence there is 100% resonable doubt, & I do believe that that is the way our american justice system is suppose to work. I would suggest that anyone who thinks that jeffery macdonald is guilty read Fatal Justice & hear both sides of the Story."
1,"Terrible, Not factual at all",If I could have given this book a -5 star rating I would have. This book is nothing but garbage. Please visit Court TV's web site and go to the Crime Library - Not Guilty? section and read the unbiased report that Court TV presents. Then come back here and buy Fatal Justice instead.
2,Major Holes in Theory,"I had to give an extra star for all the work done researching (I would have given it only one star otherwise), but the book doesn't address several problems with the Theory ""MacDonald did it"".1. A person tweaking on amphetamines doesn't just stop and calmly, rationally stage a crime scene.2. Evidence that MacDonald was there is NOT evidence that he killed his wife. (Take notice he did live there!)3. An open chest wound is not a ""flesh wound""! It is hazardous to life even today.4. The Jury didn't hear all of the evidence, even McGinniss had to acknowledge this in the book.5. Hearsay evidence is high suspect, especially when it is not sourced."
4,Reporter part of the story?,"McGinnis sseems to squarely insert himself in the story from the beginning which somewhat impacts his professed role as an observer. He goads McDonald to act out upon his narcissistic tendencies..Given the time the book was written and all of the excellent investigative research done by the author, it is a book with merit and one of the best in its genre."
5,best true crime story,"""Fatal Vision"" by Joe McGinniss is a must read for everyone interested in true crime stories.Even knowing that Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald will be found guilty eventually,the character of the former Green Beret is such an enigma, that yourfeelings may go back-and-forth about his guilt: how is it possible, that such a talented, hard-working,""normal"" human being is capable of such a heinous crime."
2,Not the 2012 publication,"Even though it states that the publication date is 2012, what was delivered was NOT the most recent edition. I was frustrated to see that it was the same book I have in print. The story and writing is 5 star for the original product."
5,Fatal Vision,This book was amazing told the story the way it was told from both sides! And let you decide who you believed! After reading the book it brought the victims back to life
3,"Cool idea, but-","I think that the author had a really excellent idea, but I don't think it was developed very well. There were parts of it that didn't really make sense to me, like how Morgaine, who is in most cases called the Fairy, was against fairies. But there were also parts that were fully engrossing and I really enjoyed. To me, it read like a first draft. It was, however, one of the few King Arthur stories that I could stand to read all the way through. I would have liked to see Arylwren as a slightly more flawed character- she seemed too perfect and benign to be true, while everyone else was a bit of a mess. I think it had gaps, as well. I don't think I would recommend it to other people, but if you enjoy King Arthur tales, then maybe you'll find it better that I found it."
3,A new take on an old story,"I enjoyed this book immensely. I thought that it was very refreshing. Most of the Arthur accounts are told differently, but this is from the viewpoint of Merlin's daughter, a voice not previously heard. As such, I think that's part of the appeal. Obviously, the major themes in the story--sword in the stone, Gwenevere & Lancelot's betrayal, and Merlin's advice are the same. It's just the perspective has changed.Wren grew up with Arthur, Lancelot, Cai and the other Companions. They were her friends as she was traveling the length & breadth of Britain with her father. Soon, she was taken to Avalon to train as a priestess. However, the needs of the outerworld summoned her and she left Avalon to assist the Merlin. She comes to face her love of Arthur, the forced marriage to Carradoc, and betrayal by those closest to her father and Arthur. She also grows into her own role of advisor and mistress of her own household.Keep an open mind and be ready for the differences that await."
4,Lang is fresh,"Jeff Lang gives a fresh and personal voice to the blues. Another reviewer complains that he isn't Son House or Robert Johnson and so forth. Yeah, this is what... 60 years later? A blues fan for many years, I get tired of guys that can't look beyond their dusty old records and nostalgia for an era that they didn't live in and perhaps didn't quite exist. Son House is fine, but he had limited musical talent. Jeff is not only technically talented, he brings a fresh personal message into a style that has too long suffered from a lack of innovation."
4,"brilliant guitar work, writing and singing","Jeff Lang is a one man explosive musical energy field. He is so good on the slide guitar that you are left shaking your head when he sings so well at the same time. The mood created by Jeff's bluesier songs is the kind that fits a long night drive so well. He rocks with the best and does it all so effortlessly. It is only a matter of time before this Australian wonder becomes a favorite of rock and blues fans every where. And with his deep talent, he will be be around for a long time. Buy this CD, that's all I can say."
2,This movie IS NOT directed by Lau Kar Leung!!!!!,"I had to point that out after seeing this, AGAIN!!!!!!!! I don't remember the other name(s) of this movie is but it is sad that they always stupidly rename these.Basically the plot is about a young girl who is the princess and is on the run after her father(the emperor) kills himself. She loses an arm but that doesn't stop her, well, at all from what I could tell. It is an extremely boring film all the way and after Lo Lieh's cameo as a wandering swordsman, Carter Wong FINALLY shows back up and helps the retarded sister of the princess. Carter puts on a GREAT acting performance and the final fight with the ridiculous looking baddie is just not good enough, but certainly better than the rest of the film.The film print from Tai Seng is very bad at the start but cleans up and you are able to see the fights pretty well, at least the few fights that there are."
4,How I adore Ani..,"But she has better albums. This is a good album, but not necessarily a fabulous Ani album.. I can listen to whole Ani albums and not feel the urge to press the forward button, but this is not one of them. Certainly, it has wonderful tracks, particularly 'Anyday', '4th of July' and 'Pick yer Nose', but I must confess I find some of the tracks exceptionally irritating, particularly 'Names Dates and Time' (I don't know why, I find it grating!) and 'Blood in the Boardroom.' I am by no means a prude, but that strikes me as a particularly crude track and beyonds the realms of mere feminism.. She seems more like a joyful girl on this album, and while it is Ani and therefore marvellous, there are higher degrees of marvellous I am afraid!"
5,I LOVE this Album,"This is one of my absolute favorite Ani albums. The lyrics and melodies are catchy and the album is short (only about 30 minutes) so it's perfect for driving in the car or while tooling around the house. Her lyrics and poetry are as personally and politically relevant as always but there's also a really playful side (Blood in the Boardroom, Pick Yer Nose) that Ani doesn't showcase too often in her later albums. A more ""human"" Ani is appparent in this album than in any she's produced since. Definitely buy Puddle Dive."
3,"ANI IS A GODDESS, BUT THIS STILL GETS A 3","I found this to be Ani's most annoying album. I can listen to most for hours. I just don't like the instrumentals. though. ""i cant get over it and i cant get through"" I just dont like it...look at Ani Difranco , the original."
4,WHY ME?,"I have always used PONY spring clamps because their quality is superior to cheaper models. They have a high quality spring, fine finish and better tip pads that stay on unlike quick-grips yellow tips which come off too easily. HOWEVER loyal PONY users should check out the PONY 3-way spring clamp which works as a spring clamp or as an incredibly simple edge-clamp. The 3-way edging spring also made by PONY, is a superior tool and more tool for your money."
3,Not to strong,"Though I love the charm the necklace broke a week after I received it. I have since replaced it. I felt it was a bit pricey after only having it a week and it breaking, though I do like the charm."
2,"Unless you prefer liquid body cream, DON'T PURCHASE","Body Cream is thinner than some lotions I've used. I was not at all pleased with this purchase. I chose body cream because I wanted something to bring out the fragrance but, not overwhelm. I would have ordered lotion if I wanted something light (thin). You could actually pour it from the jar."
1,last but not least,at this age ?most of the people just wait the evening tea.But the time pass and hermeto continue to enjoy my ears and the rest.Music of senses and emotions.
2,Just plain stupid,"Did not care for the story line. This was billed as a comedy, but if it was then I forgot to laugh. I thought it was just plain dumb."
4,Serling captures the spirit of TWA,"In Howard Hughes' Airline, Serling captures the enduring spirit of Trans World Airlines. This book, resulting from numerous employee interviews, is able to give the reader excellent insight into why TWA is so special after 75 years in the air. From the eccentricities of Howard Robard Hughes to the genius of Jack Frye, this inside look at the world's greatest airline is sure to interest anyone from the casual historian to the aviation buff."
3,"Very loosely assembled, good anecdotal material.","Serling's book seems to be written mostly from interviews conducted during various TWA employee reunions. He calls it an ""informal history"", but it's more of a gossip fest. Don't plan on using this book for a term paper. However, anyone interested in TWA or Howard Hughes will find a wealth of anecdotal insights from within the operation, as recalled by people who were there. It is fun, although at times, labored reading."
1,Ugly Fugly Latina With No Talent,"She was a wash-up long before she was forgotten. On a recent Talk radio station here in New York, they did a top 10 Worst Dance Club Albums/Singers: Gillette came in 2nd and one the Most Cheesy Award and Jaded Singer of the Decade Award.I don't know if it was a joke but it was said she got cut from her record company, was unable to get any deal and turned down and fell into a very bad depression and disappeared. Apparently, in the 90's she lived a very sleazy life.Total talent-less latina trash and seemingly born that way."
2,Mostly not worth it,"A lot of people said she was ugly. I think she's pretty cute, however I can't say that I disagree with what most people think of her personality. She's sassy, trashy, and hardly classy, but I will admit that I like the song ""Oops Too Late"" even if only for the catchy background music (which was at least original rather than sampled)."
5,The first and last name in Clamps,"I'm a novice woodworker, and I'm just starting up my first few projects. I was online, prepared to buy some Pony Clamp sets to make some pipe clamps. After reading the reveiews on the Bessey Clamps, I decided to bite the bullet on the price. What a great move this was.I doubt I'll ever buy another brand of clamp. These things are great. Certainly the best clamps I've ever used, or heard about. The are 100% positively worth the price."
5,Bessey Clamps,"They are a little pricey compared to say the clamps at Harbor Freight, but once you use them you will know why. They are superior in every way. When you clamp with them the wood does not move around since the jaws are parallel. And you can get tons of clamping force out of them. Very nice tools."
4,new wave of today,Take a trip through outer space. I like it it's different than anything ive heard before. Some songs sounded like daryl hall and john oats with key boards but overall its pretty good. Nexterday is a cool song. I did get a little tired of the voice distortion.
5,The Best,"Simply the best New Wave album since the mid 80s.More than just the sad parody of New Wave that ismodern synth pop. This has the hooks and vibe youremember from that era. It's got incredible synth& vocoder work, but it's not just about synths. Anumber of great New Wave albums of that era werenot synth-based (think early REM and U2 albums).There was a catchy energy there that has not inso many years been seen. This album does that!"
3,nice,"This is a good song. But to me the first and second track sound the same and it differs a little in the live. If you want to hear the same song over and over well ok, but I would like a little variation from here to there."
1,more shame less joy,The only thing which would cause me more shame and less joy is admitting that i shelled out 14.00 to buy this musical embarrassment.
2,"good album, funny reviews","well i had to put in my two cents because these reviews are hilarious.the album itself is dumb. it's juvenile, and the lyrics could have been written by a 14 year old... well a 14 year old who's worldly wise!at any rate, gillette obviously has issues. her level of hotness is irrelevant, as beauty is in the eye of the beholder. however, those feeling nostalgic for the cheesy songs we danced to 10 years ago at the club will appreciate this album for what it is... basically the same reason anyone would buy a paula abdul album anymore.the lyrics are great for a girls' night out when you want to sit around and bemoan the shortcomings (physical AND emotional) of the opposite sex.it's dumb, it'll make you laugh, and that's about all anyone can say about this album."
4,Heh,"I noticed most of the reviews for this that were rude crude and downright unneeded were written by men...To those of you who think the listeners must be ugly, fat or flat chested i'm here to tell ya i love the stuff and i'm certainly no ""plain jane"".You never see very many reviews, if any at all, where men hate on men for making fun of women or the like..but a women gives a man a good lashing and men dish out some nasty, rude bull.Enough of that..this is to discuss the music. Not prove how much of a man you are or how big your penis is.I think the music is fun and very enjoyable during those summer months after leaving the club/bar and ""handing"" men right in the face after the 2nd time you've said no...Gilette is your average loud mouth 90's singer looking to ruffle a few feathers...and it looks like she succeeded!If you like music that follows along the ideal of lords of acid or peaches...i recommend you pick up a copy."
1,Hilarious yet horrible,"All I have to say to this is: OH MY GOD.""If you put your fking hands on me, you might get smoked."" <---sad, she's so funny but has no right to say such things LOL since she's quite fugly herself."
5,The personification of passion.,"Gillette has certainly captured a passion and energy that few others have dared and even fewer have succeeded in capturing. She's discharged her heart and soul into this work to create a rich and textured masterpiece in which every song is pleasantly jolting. Gillette, with the help of Twenty Fingers, put her innermost thoughts out into the open, obviously had fun doing it, and changed the thinking of listeners everywhere. In creating one of the sexiest albums of the 90s, Gillette has earned a permanent place in my heart, fueled my passion, and allowed me to reflect on my own masculinity. In true Darwinian form, Gillette captures the essence of survival of the fittest by asserting those aspects of men that she desires. Her lyrics motivate, stimulate, and force us to focus on the highest purpose of humanity, to procreate.If you find her lyrics offensive, remember that she simply reflects what we allow ourselves to be!"
5,Gillette kicks ass!!!!!!!!!,"This girl is brilliant! shes hot, cool, a great singer, and best of all says what she likes and knows how to put men in thier place.Every song on this CD is excellent, Gillette says what she wants, or in the case og the classic SHORT DICK MAN what she DOESN'T want. SHORT DICK MAN is one of the funniest songs ever! especially with the lyrics and her patronising taunting laugh which she uses to belittle tiny men who can't measure up. This is an Ace CD!!eeny weeny, teeny weeny, shrivelled little short dick man!"
3,"not bad, not great","This CD is okay. Beyond the songs that I bought it for, the rest kind of blend together and give me a headache. But I love some of the songs..."
1,Doesn't work well as alternative to yoga towel,"I'm very disappointed with this product. I was looking for an alternative to my yoga towel because I sweat more than the average bear. I was excited about the Hugger Mugger Cotton Yoga Rug based on the description. It was marketed as the perfect product for those who sweat during their yoga practice. Yes, this sucks up sweat. However; the product is extremely uncomfortable. It feels like an oudoor rug. I wouldn't even sit on it, let alone practice yoga on it. The rug is so rough that it actually chafes my palms, stomach, knees, tops of feet; basically anything that comes into contact with it. Most yoga towels provide better traction once they become moist. With this yoga rug, it is slippery when dry, moist, and wet. I had big hopes for this rug and unfortunately was quite disappointed."
1,Bad Smell,"I purchased this rug in sunshine, and I was very excited when it arrived because of the fabulous colored design. Unfortunately, once I opened the packaging, I was met with a musty smell. The rug honestly smelt like dirty dish towels. I tried to overcome the smell my airing the rug out on a clothes line for a few days. No airing time nor fabric spray could eliminate the odor. I went to one class on the rug, the smell was too strong I couldn't concentrate. Also, the rug came with many cotton threads starting to unravel within the pattern. The rug left marks on my knees and hands from poses, overall I was not impressed."
4,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this yoga mat for my Ashtanga mysore practice because I would get awfully sweaty and having my sweat drip all over my sticky mat was embarrassing. This rug did the trick! No more visible sweat drips. I use it in conjunction with my travel sticky mat for a little extra cushioning. The ""grip factor"" is pretty good for Downward Dog, once you mist it with water and work up a decent sweat. Not relying on a sticky mat to hold me in place has also helped improve my alignment and posture. The Caribbean color is absolutely beautiful.One thing I did not like about this mat is that after I threw it in the washing machine, it SHRANK in width by 3 INCHES! I didn't even machine dry it. How is that possible?! I tried to manually stretch it back out, but that only helped a little. My rug is now 26"" x 74"". Overall, I'd still recommend it. That was just kind of a bummer."
5,The best book ever on the origins of the Hungarian people.,"This is a difficult read (two volumes) in that the authoruse of old, seldom used Magyar words caused me to re-read many passages for clarity. The writing is, however, superb. Starting at the occupation of the Danube basin in 895 AD and working backwards to the ancestral home in Western China, the author takes us back to the age of population migations. Very well done."
3,The price of beauty,"These look wonderful, so sleek and classy. I oohed and aahed as I took them out of the box when they arrived. Sadly, appearances can be deceiving. The shoes look great, there's no denying that. However, there is the question of whether you can actually walk in them or not. I have spent the past month breaking them in and finally was able to walk around in them for half the day (and go up and down 2 flights of stairs) without limping or falling down. They're still not comfortable but they're getting there.Make no mistake, these shoes are lovely but you have to be vigilant about breaking them in otherwise they'll just end up being another pair of shoes you'll toss in the back of your closet because they're too uncomfortable to wear."
4,Awesome shoes for the price,"I bought these shoes in black - usually take size 7.5, but the 8 I ordered fit perfect. Very sexy platform sandal with a comfortable square peep toe and the price is unbeatable."
3,Turtle turtle turtle,"I mainly bought this for the ""Toby Tortoise Returns"" short. I was suprised how good it looked and how funny it was. I also enjoyed the first short that featured the Tortoise and the Hare as well.The rest of the shorts are typical Disney shorts. Kinda boring with no redeaming characters or comedy that he hasn't done over and over again before, but the ones that feature the two I mentioned before are really fun to watch. Worth the buy."
4,Love Harold,Just adorable. But a little disappointing that the story does not follow the tv series exactly. Much is left out even though HBO family label is on book cover. The title is different as well so I should have guessed there would be differences. I thought maybe some scenes left out not different storyline... But it serves the purpose of reading to my child what he loves...
5,Excellent framing clamp,"These additional angle plates allow clamping a frame of more than four corners. When used with the Bessey strap clamp, the self adjusting angle plates provide a user friendly method to clamp larger objects as well.Only negative is there is no feature on the clamp or the angle plates that provide easy storage when not in use."
5,Bessy VAC-6 Angle plates,"I already had the strap clamp, however it did not come with enough angle plates. I bought an extra box and I absolutely love this clamp set!"
2,Facts and fiction,"I was impressed with the Mallinson's bibliography , it provides excellent material for exploration. There is one major gaffe, the Indian Mutiny did not start in 1856, but in the following year 1857, at Meerut on a Sunday, May 10th.My other problem with this book was that the hero was always triumphant with whatever he undertook, which was not very realistic for India, and what happened to his poor fiancee? Is she still on the pier in France?"
1,"Oh, please","I gave up after the first chapter. There is no meaningful recap as to what has happened to the hero so far. It reminded me of those dreary pseudo-English epics Hollywood churned out in the 1930s, with caricatures of English officers. Despite my interest in the history of the British in India, especially the Mutiny era, I felt I would have no interest in what happened to the hero's horse, let alone the hero and his poorly-drawn lady love. Even the Duke of Wellington is a cardboard cutout. The dialogue is dreadful. This author seems to be some formulaic imitator of some contemporary English naval-ficton author, and I don't mean Hornblower's creator. This may motivate me to write my own stories.Give me George MacDonald Fraser any day, with loads of research and lots of real dialogue.Why did I waste the money buying this in hardback?"
4,Highly Recommended For Intermediate,I have only read through 4 chapters but so far I'm getting a lot out of them. I've read a a lot about synths but this book goes over every possible topic that an intermediate sound designer should be familiar with.
1,Very disappointing,Came with no box and or serial number.Seller shows picture of retail box deceptiveI will never deal with this seller again
1,horrible.... not what i expected from Mary at all,"I bought this cd without listening to it because it was Mary and because it was Mary I just knew it had to be good. Boy was I WRONG. This album is horrible. After I listened to All That I Can Say, I was speechless. I tried to figure out what exactly Mary was trying to say and I still haven't been able to figure it out.I fast forwarded through each track trying to find at least one track that could be considered this album's savior..but there wasn't one. Even Mary's rendition of Let No Man Put Asunder left a whole lot to be desired. This album is not of the same caliber as Mary's freshman and sophmore efforts What's the 411? and My Life. I don't know, maybe she matured a little too much but if that's the case she needs to regress some."
4,plain ole mary,"although different than her previous albums, Mary is definately a good cd. my favs are deep inside, memories, time, and give me you. my #1 fav is beautiful ones. it has a bangin bassline and the guitar strings are hittin. the words are also beautiful. but i must say there are,in my eyes, some very ugly songs on the album. #1 being the duet with K-ci. they sound like theyre about to die if they sing one more note. sexy is also another bad song. overall, mary still delivers as usual and its worth the buy."
5,Amazing Evolution,A great tribute to soul music from the late seventies to now. Very diverse album with some of the hottest and sexiest voices of today. An amazing evolution for this girl artist from three albums ago (don't count TOUR). One of the best R&B albums to get today.
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!,"""Mary"" by Mary J. Blige is a weak and pathetic use of CD space. I only like the first single and I feel as though I should've bought the single instead of the CD. This CD is the perfect example of being overhyped. The songs are not of the quality that she tends to have. When I bought this CD I was expecting it to be good. This CD is a waste of her beautiful voice and the recourd company's money. Needless to say, it was not as good as I expected it to be."
2,GARBAGE!!!!,"I am truly disapointed with this CD. It seems as though she is trying to achieve a more sophisticated sound and it is not working. Instead it sounds like music for older people. Mary J is labeled as being the queen of hip-hop but she forgot the hip-hop when making this CD. There are only 2 nice songs, beautiful one and all that I can say. Well all that I can say is I doubt very seriously that I will ever buy another Cd made by her"
1,What an overrated album!,"This is just not a good album. I really don't understand all the great reviews for it. People gotta realize just because it's Mary doesn't necessarily make this a good album. I find it very difficult to listen to this album without falling asleep. There isn't anything uplifting about the album. I'd say it's a good album if you're feeling down and you feel like making it worse then this is the album for you. Mary needs to go back to what made her the Queen of hip hop soul, tracks like Beautiful from the Stella soundtrack would have helped. Even Share My World was better than this one because it was a lot more varied and not so 1 dimensional. This album can only be described in one word--BORING!! If anybody disagrees, tell me a month from now if you can stomach listening to this album."
2,I would be a fool to recommend this album!,"Am I the only one here who thinks this album falls WAAAY short of my expectations for a MJB album. The fast songs are corny and most of the slow ones are horrible too. I expected much more when I thought about her previous CD's, but I guess I should have known about this after hearing her 1st single from this album. I do like about 3 songs though. I WANT THE OLD MARY MUSIC!!!! I do commend her for her depth in this album, BUT this has to be one of the worst CD's I've bought this summer (or year)."
5,"""This Is SOUL MUSIC At It's BEST""","Words can't express the way I feel about this project. If you read any of my reviews before, you know that I love me some ""soul"" music. And that's what ""Mary"" gives. ""Beautiful Ones"" (not Prince's version), ""Deep Inside"", ""Time"", and the Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis produced, ""The Love I Never Had"" are my favs. ""Thank you God for Mary J. Blige, and may you continue blessing her."" She's is truly one of the greats of our time...love ya!! Peace & Love, KEITHM....."
2,"It's ok but, it cannot compare to her three previous albums","If you think this album is going to be hip-hop oriented like the others--think again. It doesn't have the pizzaz that the others do. There is nothing special about this album. Anyone could have made this album. It doesn't rock you with hit after hit. The more that I listen to it the more I find things that I don't like. The song wth K-Ci is totally out of place! I think that Mary needs to go back to the ""essence"" and rediscover the Mary that made ""I can love you"", ""Seven Days"", ""Love No Limit"", "" I Never Want to Live without You"", ""Don't Go"", and the like.The 40-somethings may be more appreciative of this album but this 20-something is NOT feeling it. As a matter of fact, I gave the CD away."
4,Something for All you Feed up Ladies!,"Just let me say that Mary J. Blige is the queen of hip hop and probably will forever stay! Ms. MJB came out with a good album, but if your a feed up woman, mad at the male species, and down this is for you! I trully like tha album, but the only song I can relate to is All That I Can Say! I'm not that mad at men! I can't live my life angry all that time, like I can't be happy all that time! It just seemed that Ms. MJB was talking to one particular audience and that's the feed up women and that's not always me. So I really can't listen to the c.d all the time, only when I'm feed up! No doubt, when I get there it's all about Ms. MJB! I really can say this album has great songs like ALL I Can Say, Deep Inside, Your Child, and NO More Happy Holidays. I really liked those songs and I hope if your a true fan and no matter what you'll go get the album, because it's a real album and it does deal with the real issues!"
1,SAD,"Mary needs to step back and listen to the real divas and quit frontin. She will NEVER come close to the quality, class or style of the REAL divas like Patti, Gladys, Whitney, Mariah, Toni, Aretha, Dianna, and the list goes on - without Mary!!"
3,Good but not as good as the old stuff!!,"I like Mary J. Blige's album, Mary. There are some solid songs. Among the albums best cuts are All That I can Say (best song on cd), Sexy, Deep Inside, Don't Waste your time (Aretha Franklin makes this song), Give me You (written by the world's best ballad writer Diane Warren), and Let no Man put Asunder (a rare dance track). The other songs are bland, typical, run of the mill R & B songs. I don't like them. Overall, this album is not as good as Share my World, and My Life (Mary's best album). Still, if you're a Mary fan, you'll love it. I just wish she would have worked with Puffy or Rodney Jerkins. They bring out the best in Mary."
3,DEPRESSING !!!!,"I just purchased the cd yesterday. Most of the songs consist of a man that she cannot get off her mind, a man that has fathered another child, a man that her family does not know about. Where are the positive images of men ? Some of the songs have the same beat as Lauryn Hill's album come to mention that Lauryn wrote and produced ""All that I can Say "". The song with K-Ci did not need the cursing because the song was bad enough. This album speaks of a very desperate woman who only knows how to depend on a man for her every need. Where is the substance ? Women today have achieved a new level of independence, but with this album, Mary you have put us back two steps further. I'm selling my cd to a used cd store today."
2,Not her best.,"A Big dissapointment from Mary. The only good songs were the singles. The filler is just that, a waste of space. I just really didn't feel anything with this album."
5,I was not a Mary J. Blige fan but this CD is truly awesome.,"I love the entire CD. I would definitely recommend this one. Mary, you go girl!"
4,Mary J is the Queen of R&B!!! She is still reigning,"This is a great albumn. From the lyrics I heard, Mary has grown since her freshmen albumn!! I am a great fan of hers. I pray that her God given talent keeps touching the hearts of many."
5,Find Strength In Your Moments Of Weakness,"I bought 411 and I really loved it. However there were a few albums before SHARE MY WORLD AND MARY I did not purchase. I wasn't really feeling them. This is a dynamic cd from beginning to end. All that I can say*,Sexy,Deep Inside***,Beautiful One*** should be enough to get you hooked. Mary has definitely matured as an artist. This cd is memorable and she takes you on a journey.""Your Child"" is a true but sad statement of what's going on in lives. ""Give me you** a gem of a song.This cd goes through a myriad of emotions she was going through and the follow up ""No more Drama is evident she was making her peace. Find strength in your moments of weakness.Deep Inside I wish everyone could listen to Rascal Flatts's I'M MOVING ON.***God Bless you Mary, Keep your head up"
4,New Mary,"The Queen of hip-hop soul is no more. Its understandable why Mary wanted to go out and make a new type of music. She's older amd more mature. And now even better. The first four songs are excelent (esp. Sexy) and emotional. Blige isn't angry; she's no different thn an MC venting their frustrations about life on the mic.The CD is Okay from their, with a really good duet from K-Ci (#10) and one of the best songs on the CD (your child)Mary also shows more vocal range on this disc which is a suprise. Once you get this disc and realize that it's not the same Mary from 411 or my Life, you will really appreciate it."
5,"Mary, Don't you weep.","Mary shares her experience in her music which makes it very grassroots. When the party is over , you still gotta deal with you. Mary makes herself available to us through her music. Its like having someone to talk to without having to say anything at all. Mary makes it possible for you to appreciate music again. Mary, don't you weep; for God, your fans, and surely those of whom have made themselves evident to you will always love, support, and protect you. This artist is truly an icon in the making. The prophecy is known. This CD is worth its weight in gold. Add it to your musical archive. PS Tracks entitled ""Your Child"" and ""Beautiful Ones"" are breathtaking. The remake of te club classic ""Its not Over' IS A MIND BLOWING EXPERIENCE!"
1,Boring and disappointing,"I wanted so badly to love this album, because I've loved the stuff Mary's done up to now. But to tell you the truth, I haven't listened past the 7th cut because it puts me to sleep. All the songs seem to be in the same tempo (slow) and the lyrics ramble on and on and on. No good ""hooks,"" nothing to stand out and make you want to hear a song again and again. The used-CD store will defintely be taking this one off my hands."
3,Just old Mary- tasha,"Well, All I Can Say is that Mary needs to stop singing about depressing songs. I like some of her songs, but the one with K-C, that's just horrible Iam sorry. Thay voices just don't click. I think that Mary needs to work on her voice. Now I like the one with Aretha Franklin, but I except more of Mary .You know! I don't think Mary is the best singer , but she is O.K.God Bless You Mary and I hope God will give you a man that will love you for you."
5,Worthwhile forlorn melancholy,All I have too say is that Mary has come a long way since 'What's the 411'. Like many soul singers you could feel her angst on her sleeve. The music was very nice but the lyrical content really makes this a nice albumn to have and listen too. If you listen carefully to the lyrics she is speaking to former lovers and false friends and anyone else making pretentions about her. She speaks volumns in the song 'Deep Inside' and it continues on with the duet with K-Ci Hailey. Very nice musical trip through her life up to now. I hope it is cathartic for her as she put her foot and more into this one. I have always dismissed her since I saw her first live muscical offering on Saturday Night Live after release of her first albumn. She really has come a long way and can supplant her 'hip-hop soul' moniker with releases such as this. Go ahead & I can't wait for Mary II.
5,REAL SOUL LIVES,"Mary J. Blige, one of the last few remaining owners of raw soul and intensity delivers yet again with her new album ""Mary"". Blige never being one to try to ""pretty up"" a song invests a rough, real spirit into these selections and comes away again and again flooring you with her shattering emotional fire and spirit. Her vocals on the duet with Aretha Franklin ""Don't Waste Your Time"" underplays and cross cuts Franklin's shouts and travels brilliantly to the core of the song. After I heard Blige's album ""My Life"", I thought to myself that she couldn't transfix me any more powerfully but this album further demonstrates her limitless potential and mesmerizing soulfulness."
2,All That I Can Say Is Try More Harder Next Time,"I must agree with a previous review, this collection of songs by Mary J. Blige is missing what brought her to the forefront of R&B music...the hip-hop flava...The only songs reminiscent of that on this cd were ""Sexy"" and ""Memories"", and I say ""Memories"" because the music sounded similar to The Notorious B.I.G's"" ""I Got A Story To Tell"" from the ""Life After Death"" cd. Her attempt is a more mature sound but she tried too hard and I just couldn't feel it. Maybe if she had experimented with these works over the course of 3 or 4 more albums instead of forcing it on ""Mary"". Just not feeling this at all."
4,The Once and Future Queen,"Memo to Faith Evans: Your voice is smooth and your tracks are slick, but you can't outshine the Queen!Mary J. Blige slays the competition with her new disc ""Mary"" and still manages to leave herself room to grow. Gone are the dated messages on her answering machine/intro skits followed by incessant interludes; ""Mary"" strips away the glitter and mines gold on almost every track.She breaks it down on ""Your Child"" and manages to hold her own with Lauryn Hill, Elton John, and the Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin!The album ""Mary"" is everything ""Share My World"" was not, it's a classic in league with ""My Life.""Buy this album, listen to the songs, cry, scream, bleed-- and be healed."
4,The album is off the hook.,"This is classic Mary right here. Mary makes you feel her pain; she takes you there with her. All the pain, suffering, strife, and drama that she's gone through is definitely felt by the listener. ""Deep Inside"" is one of my favorite cuts, especially at the end when she says that everytime she finds a man she can't trust him. There is so much emotion in that line as well as the entire cd in general."
5,The Beautiful Ones,"When it comes to a Mary J Blige album you never know what to expect but you know that you gonna get her best.When I saw the Video for All That I Can Say I knew I was gonna get Mary when it came out in AUG 99 and that I did. When I got home I found a more jazz influenced Mary that had a lot more soul than her prior releases which was good. This cd was different thought she took you there more on this cd with tracks like I'm not lookin ,Your Child, I'm In Love and The Beautiful Ones. This cd is hot and perfect for evenings around the house or Kickin it. I highly recommend a copy of MARY."
5,This is the Mary CD to get!,"If you're going to buy any of Mary's CD's (or maybe all) this one HAS to be included in that list. Of all the albums Mary has done, this one is filled with the most emotion and the most thought-provoking lyrics yet. Songs like ""Beautiful Ones"" and ""Your Child"" are sort of haunting in their beat and in the words. Mary's newest album, ""No More Drama"", PALES in comparison to this. While her others also have a few soul-touching songs (but not many) ""Mary"" has the most. It shows a mature Mary. A Mary with real emotions and deep thoughts-not the superficial Mary of ""No More Drama"".To sum it all up, JUST GET THIS CD!"
4,Mary's a REAL soullady,"Mary's new selftiteled album is a dream of soul and RnB. As always Mary understands to bring life into a disc. Her lyrics are well and not one-dimensional at all and her voice still tastes like Amaretto with a piece of ice: Bittersweet, but still wonderful. An album for listening while chilling at home or in car. Mary is a strong lady and that reflects in her music. Great work! I admire it."
2,LONG TIME FAN BUT THIS CD DID NOT MOVE ME,"When I heard this CD for the first time it did not move me. 3 weeks past before I listen again. I think the mood was right because there's a few songs that touched me 2,3,4,5, & 10. This CD has a different spirit to it but I'am not mad at you Miss Lady of Soul. My favorite CD was Share Your World and I have all of them. I will always be a big fan and support you lady. I Can not wait for your next CD."
5,one of the best albums this year,"I just wish I could have heard the rest of the songs on the album, but from the ones I did hear I love it."
2,This was my first time buying a Mary J. album. Never again!,"I decided to buy Mary's album after hearing just two of her singles that were released. After listening to the first 4 or 5 songs, I went so sleep. In my opinion, the album is full of slow cuts with mellow music. Don't waste your money."
3,STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO.......BUT SHE'S GETTING THERE,"Ms. Blige is back again with her new CD, ""Mary"". The album isn't ground-breaking or exceptional; Mary still has the tendency of singing flat and a little of key but she's come a long way since '92 and definetly is coming into her own as an artist. Standout's on the album include my personal favorite, ""All That I Can Say"" featuring my homegirl Lauryn Hill, ""Beautiful Ones"", ""I'm In Love"", ""Don't Waste Your Time"", ""Memories"", ""Not Lookin"", and ""The Love I Never Had"". Just one question though: What happened to ""Sincerity"" featuring Nas and DMX ?!"
2,"All sound and fury, sexy not","The point to this eye-candy movie apparently is: once in the gang, never out. Leave and you live your life scared. That's all folks. The title is a tease to cover for an empty shell of a script."
2,Disappointing,"I love independent cinema, but sometimes I don't understand certain accolades. For instance, why in the world was Blair Witch so lauded? That was also the case with Sexy Beast, which I wanted to love but later just wanted to get through. A lot of people spoke well of Ben Kingsley's intense performance and it was intense, but that doesn't make up for lack of plot or story.Ok, now that all the Sexy Beast partisans hate me, I will say that the cinematography was top notch and the commentary track was worthwhile. There were great moments of tension in the movie between Kingsley and anyone, and later between the mob boss and our hero, Ray Winstone. I just wish all that tension was building up for something more than the decided payoff."
2,review and spoilers - so read carefully,"Spoilers below, but it tells why I give this movie 2 stars tops.The movie is 90 minutes and (spoiler next line)the first hour is just the mafia guy showing up, sticking around and trying to get the guy to go do the heist job. An HOUR just on that ? I started fast forwarding through some bits because I started to think the whole movie was like that. The heist itself takes up 5-10min of the whole movie. You get about an hour of ""you will do it !"", ""no I won't"", ""you will!"", ""no I won't"". Not for my tastes, disappointing."
2,A big Boredom.,"The screenplay is kinda weird. Kinsley is a very good actor but failed to deliver as a believable ganster only with loud mouth full of the [profane] words again and again. Kinda tiresome. The whole movie looked pretty dragged from the very beginning and I very doubt that the director and all the other members who shot this movie might fell asleep during the shooting. Very contrite and uninterested scenario even the the swimming pool drilling to get into the bank vault did not look so exciting. All in all, what's the purpose of shooting this aimless movie?"
2,beast... not so sexy,"The fuss about this film, in my opinion, was largely hype. I don't see much redeeming about this film apart from Ben Kingsley's performance. His brutality is stunning to watch, and although the film was entertaining, it was no classic. As a matter of fact, it has been some time since I watched this film, and I had built it up in my head so much, having read reviews and so on, and when I finally did see it, it was just unappealing and partly unintelligible, apart from a scene with Ben Kingsley in an airplane."
2,Overrated,"The critics did it this time. This was decent film on the note that it contained all of the different aspects needed to create a great film, but it lacked continuous flow. Before I saw Sexy Beast I read the critics reviews on how this movie was compared to some of Guy Richie's films such as Snatch and Lock, Stock, and two smoking barrels. This film doesn't come close to the imaginative mind of Guy Richie. Sexy Beast isn't even on the same wave length. That was fault number one. Since I was over hyped and expecting a lot more from this, all I can give Sexy Beast is 2 stars."
3,Sexy beast is not so sexy,"I saw this movie and was not impressed with the story of this film. This film was about a retired criminal that could not say ""no"" to his ""Don"". I am sorry, but this is an everyday occurence in society. There are people all over that have a difficult time in saying no to something that they don't believe in or want to do. The only reason I am giving this movie 3 stars is for Ben Kingsley's performance in his role. He certainly does show his diverse abilities to act. See it for yourself and make your own decisions. You may like it, I didn't."
2,Terrible and dull,"Slow. So, so slow and quiet and boring. I would rather watch Apocalypse Now 3 times in a row than sit through the nothingness that is this movie's 1st half. The 2nd half isn't anything better, either. There is some blood, and Kingsley freaks out, but the inevitable heist was monotonous and whatever symbolism the rabbit guy stood for was completely useless and uninviting.A waste of my 1 1/2 hours."
2,"over rated,over drawn,over and out!","unsure why this got so much hype(then again,im still miffed by the kudos the abysmal training day received!).here we have what amounts to a jealous tough guy(ben kingsley)who forcefully recruits a long time business associate.seems like theres ONE MORE JOB to pull of.and hes not taking no for an answer.this so called bad guy is so under developed its sickening.for the most part,its him asking/telling and his would be recruit to take this job,and then having recruit say no.this volleys back and forth until even the director/writer got sick of it and sent ben to airport.this is where the jealousy enters.without giving everything away,i found this to be pretty dull.theres some nice yelling and a couple of quirky moments but they quickly fade and give way to alot of nothing.i do not suggest anyone waste their time/money on this.instead,get mean streets."
4,"Darkly funny British crime thriller, great performances","`Sexy Beast' shares the same plot premise as David Mamet's ""Heist"", also released in 2001 - a retired thief is lured into doing one more job. This British film, though, is a different animal. Both dark and comic, director Jonathan Glazer's first movie is highly energetic and has both style and substance.Gal [Ray Winstone], along with his ex-porn star wife, Deedee [Amanda Redman] has happily retired to a villa above the glorious Costa del Sol in Spain. Back in dreary old London, gangster Teddy [Ian McShane] needs his services for a bizarre robbery plan sends Don Logan [Ben Kingsley] to convince him. Completely mad and with all the warmth of a pit bull, he's a hard man to refuse. Caught between a rock and a hard place, Gal plays along. Or does he?Kingsley is brilliant, and it's hard to believe this is the same gentle guy who played Gandhi. He's deservedly been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Highly recommended for fans of film noir."
4,A great gangster film.,"When I first heard about this film in a local newspaper I thought to my self, 'How could Ben Kingsley be scary?' Although a good question when I saw the movie I saw that he was one of the most frightening charactors I have ever seen. Kingsley plays Don Logan a phycotic gangster who goes to Spain to pull Ray Winstone (a retiered gangster) out for one last job. He dose not want to but finds that saying no to Logan is even more scary that a rock crashing into you'r swimming pool (see the movie and you will understand). The acting is first rate and Kingsley recieved a much deserved Oscar nomination for his role. The movie sags at the end slightly but it can be forgivin."
4,"Sexy Beast not very ""sexy"" but good value for money","I was leant this film by a friend and took ages to get around to seeing it simply because the title was so naff.I STILL don't get why it was called that (Ray Winstone, quite large and sporting an impossible tan maybe?) but whatever the title it delivered.I was mostly amazed by Ben Kingsley's portrayal of an East End hard-nut, whose performance sent shivers down my spine, and was the main reason I think this film was fab.LocK, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels it ain't but that doesn't mean it isn't worth a watch.Beware those who don't like cussing......just stick your fingers in your ears.I must have thought it was good because i bought a copy off Amazon/.com and snet it to an ex-pat in the States"
2,a disappointment,"Kingsley was great in his role, but I couldn't understand anything that was said. Thank goodness for DVD subtitle option! That helped. But all in all, I was disappointed. At the end, I said ""IS THAT IT!?!"" I was truly surprised. I didn't feel like I had watched a movie. It wasn't terrible or anything, just disappointing. Guess it just depends on your taste. Maybe if there was more character development? Honestly, it seemed more an exercise for Kingsley as an actor, or perhaps a one-dimensional display of a crazed, violent personality. This film missed something."
3,Not sure why it won awards,"This is a stylish movie with a lot of nice pieces that don't fit together. Most of the movie is set in Spain, and the lush camerawork perfectly sets the main character's mood. However, like a boulder which comes from nowhere, Ben Kingsley's character descends on the little family unit of two retired criminals and their wives. Ben Kingsley's performance is similar to Denzel Washington's in Training Day -- they chew up every scene. The acting was good throughout. There's also some neat scenes where the main character imagines the devil.What's the problem with the movie? There's no character development, nobody really changes their minds or attitudes, the heist is boring, and the final destination of Ben Kingsley's character is no surprise (but the movie seems to think it is)."
4,Outstanding performances,"If you like to watch great actors work, you'll enjoy Sexy Beast just for the performances of Ben Kingsley and Ian McShane. But, if violence in film is not for you, don't see this movie."
5,"Beastly Stuff, And Utterly Fascinatng","The more I see ""Sexy Beast,"" the more fascinating it gets, and it was pretty interesting the first time! And, at less than an hour-and-a-half it's even more watchable. It also is a good idea to play this with the English subtitles on, unless you can understand the strong British accents, and can interpret the slang words.Ben Kingsley, as sociopath ""Don Logan,"" is unbelievably intense and almost has my jaw dropping when watching him in here. Ian McShane is another creepy guy in here as ""Teddy."" It's also very stylishly filmed.This is one movie you will not forget. Warning: it's rough, crude and strange. Expect a lot of ""f"" words and ""c"" words. Also expect an interesting 89 minutes."
1,Fell asleep,Boring. I couldn't get past the first 45 minutes. So damn boring. Ben Kingsley came across as this little twerp with big bully attitude. British accents just don't go with gangster-mobster scene. I like Britain just not their movies. If you go for that sort of thing then you'll enjoy it but I was bored to tears I'm still trying to get up the gumption to watch the rest of it since I bought the damn thing.
3,A movie about me,"Sexy Beast is worth seeing just to watch Ben Kingsley get so incredibly angry, he nearly bites some dude. Outside of Kingsley though, and one other scary, intimidating guy, the movie itself is pretty blah. Overall, it's just a good actor showcase. How is this the same guy who played Ghandi?"
1,Awful,"3 DVD were sent to me in AUSTRALIA with incorrect region code therefoer cannot play. Emailed you and your response was ""bad luck"" and that I should not buy from that supplier.Thanks very much but not a very good customer relations excercise from you.Never use you again"
1,"Bad,bad,bad,bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",A total waste of time. This movie is as bad as they get. I have found dental work to be more enjoyable than this movie.
4,Compelling at times,"The author disparages several people in this book, including those who are not alive to defend themselves. This reflects more negatively on the author than on the persons he criticizes. Nonetheless, the book is compelling at times, particularly where the author talks about the patients he has helped, or those he has tried to help but who did not survive. The author was and is clearly a major figure in a field which has done much to prolong and improve the lives of many people. If the book accomplishes nothing else, hopefully it will encourage its readers to provide for the donation of their organs after death, or those of their loved ones."
5,"Comfortable, good price","Good quality, good price. It's plain white t-shirts, what else is there to say? If you are wearing a dress shirt, you should wear a t-shirt underneath. I don't want to see your nipples or your chest hair through your shirt."
3,Inexpensive White Ts,"Cheap undershirts that will last you a few months before becoming shop rags-- which is all you can ask, I guess.They seem to start losing their brilliant-white after a few washes and the necks stretch out instantly. It is nice not having a sewn-on tag on the back of the neck to cause itchiness, but would like to see a little more elasticity around the neck to hold its shape better."
4,Great price on a terrific clamp,"These clamps are the greatest thing since sliced bread. The parallel clamping force, the non marring jaw surfaces, the ease of adjustment are all good features. So much better than those cheap pipe clamps that I had been using. Just waiting for more of them to go on sale so I can get some other lengths"
3,Idiots are shipping your clamps..,"Only an idiot would ship the clamps in the way that these guys do... When you order the clamp, there is a very good chance you will recieve an empty box that the clamp has fallen out of... if you are lucky to still have the clamp in the box, there is a good chance it will be halfway hanging out and banged up pretty bad...The best clamps, the best prices, idiots in shipping department..."
2,"Great product, horrible packaging","I love the Bessey clamps, but when these arrived they looked as though they had been sitting in someone's attic for 5 years and then just thrown into a box. There was no packaging material to keep them from bouncing around and because of this, one of the end caps was missing upon arrival. Great product, but I would hesitate before buying anything that is shipped from Noble Direct."
3,Flip was Funnier than this,"Sorry, but Flip Wilson was funnier than this video. Somehow it is put together badly, or, the skits were chosen badly. I wanted to see the show as it had appeared on TV all those years ago, lively and spirited; but this video just doesn't convey that feeling."
3,Jorgensen 3718,"The one I received is not like the one in the picture or the other 15 year old 3718 I own. The one that just arrived does not have a rivet through the top clamp as it should. It has a stamped dimple which will probably hold but it is NOT pinned. The only other short coming is the bar is about 1/2"" shorter than my old one. Guess they now get 37 clamps out of the material that used to yield 36.I am a little disappointed, in particular because the picture does not represent the current product.Other than these 2 issues, the clamp is identical to my old one."
2,Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,"I generally do a lot of research and digging before I make a tool purchase. This has allowed me to build a collection of tools which I am extremely happy with. This clamp is the exception. I bought a pair of these based on the makers name and price. I shouldn't have. The ""bar"" on these bar clamps is flimsy. I bent one of mine the very first time I used it. I would never buy another one of these."
3,Narrower Bar = Weaker Clamp,"Of course, you get what you pay for, but the Bessey version of this clamp (at about $3 more) has a much larger bar and can apply a great deal more pressure. The bar on this clamp bends considerably, but if you are doing primarily light clamping it should not be a problem. I've used this clamp (among others) for several years without permanently bending the bar."
3,Adequate For Light Clamping Chores,"If these clamps are used as their design is intended (gluing up cabinet, drawer, etc joints), they perform adequately. The thumbscrew works just fine for applying the desired pressure. The adjustable head moves freely and effortlessly IF the bar is clean. Be sure to immediately remove any glue drippings that finds its way to the bar or the next time you go to move the head it will hang up. I used these clamps in gluing up a 2x4 laminated workbench top. This operation stretched them (and then some) to the maximum of their capability. Multiple clamps spaced closely together were required to press the bow out of some of my pieces. In retrospect, a heavier duty "" Pony clamp would have been better fitted for this particular job. But if you use these within their limits, they will perform for a long time."
5,scottrm,"perfect fit, thanks,was easy to install and dont think the wind will cause down draft with the desigh.also price was right!"
5,Don't let the cover art fool you...,"I received this CD from a good friend, and I have yet to take it out of my CD player. It's a fun, rollicking romp of an album with lots of cheeky retro flourishes, tightly mixed and lovingly sung. I really wish they would release another album (or at least play my town sometime!) because they really are a great band with a terrific uncompromising sound."
3,"Helpful, but could be better","This behind-the-seat organizer certainly was something that was needed in my F150 standard cab truck. However the depth of the storage areas and the height of the lips on the front of the areas is just lacking a bit. If the shelves were only 2"" deeper and the lips 1"" higher the organizer could successfully hold much more of what I typically want to keep behind the seat like jumper cables, log chain, tow hitch, etc."
2,"Books, books and books again! Annoying...","Very overrated! The remake is not as good as Stanley 'the master' Kubrick who use more subtility than this mini serie for tv. Hey Folks! Would you stop to base your rates for movies by compare it to books! A film is not a book and it's annoying for cinephile who doesn't past days to read novels! Does your books rated are based on a movies?!! For the movie... go rent/buy the excellent Kubrick classic cause it's much better but stop to mix books and movies, they'll never be the same things and books aren't always better than movies."
1,It Stinks,This Was A Horrible Version. Stephen king you really messed up on this. the other version gets 5 stars! this version dosent even qualify as garbage. my trash can would puke if i threw it away!
2,I saw the shinning on Si fi,I saw the movie on sience fiction telvision and the movie Was pretty good I got into the movie and When Danny was in the Play ground and the hedges came alive that was pretty scary. than it was over. And I was mad. So i want to buy the movie. I saw the 1980 Movie With JackN. And I wasn't satisfied I didn't like the danny acting or the mom or dad. and the whole plot was wrong!Didn't Follow with the Book at all.
2,Awful,"Stanley Kubricks version of The Shining was 100 times better than this one. I mean lets look at it, Jack Nicholson vs. Stephen Weber, Nicholson who is a very scary man with an extensive filmography, and did and excellent job, or Stephen Weber, best know for his performance on Wings...Wings, one f the worst shows ever. Weber performance in this new version of The Shining was not even terrifying. But Nicholson, who brought chills to my spine, terrified the hearts of millions. Overall rating of The Shining (1997)... D-"
3,"Good movie, bad packaging",The movie is great but the security seals on the case are horrible. When you take them off they rip the case. I returned it once and the second one still did the same thing.
1,"Faithful, yet faithless","It truly is great to see a movie made version of a book, and this one is pretty close. I must say though, this movie was not scary. Danny looks like a chipmonk, and Jack is not fit for the role(he looks like an ugly girl on the cover). The film is too long, and cannot be compared to the classic version with Jack Nicholson. This movie was pretty low-budget if you ask me, and dont listen to any of the good reviews. Rent the older one, and you'll be more pleased with youre choice. Why do you think it was a ""made for t.v movie?"" It was too crappy to be let out in theaters, so they released it on t.v, and hardly anybody knew about it. Those who did know, barley cared."
3,A good Steven King movie,The third best translation of a Steven King novel into a movie. You won't forget this one.
3,Great beginning.,"I love the first 75% of this movie. I agree with what the other reviewers have stated which is that this is a very loyal adaptation of the book in that you can truly see Stephen King's vision visually speaking.Creepy and well photographed, this newer version of The Shining is awesome in terms of creep factor. My only hang-up (and it's a big one) is the ending. I honestly thought it was too cheesily directed. The trying-too-hard-to-have-a-feel-good-ending was just too much."
5,HERERRR's A great version of the book.,"I loved the mini-series. Due to in fact that it was fillmed at the actual hotel ( The Stanley in Estes Park, Colo.) that Stephen King wrote the book from. They even used the real room 217 ( the room in witch he wrote the book from, and ladies & gentelman this reviewer has had the pleasure to stay in.)I loved it when they covered Jack's alcoholism. That happend in the book. In the Stanley Kurbrick version it just has Jack going insaine.This movie makes me homesick for Colorado again."
5,"Redrum,Redrum!","When I was a little kid I read King's SHINING and loved it!Then I saw Kubrick's ""adaptation"" and was disappointed at the deviation from the novel.I enjoyed it for it's creepiness and style,but thought that was that.Luckilly King decided to make a tv miniseries of his novel and the results are superb!Very suspensful and credible with brilliant performances.Watching it on dvd or video allows the narrative to keep going and suspense to build without those commercials interrupting."
4,"Suspenseful, funny and entertaining","I liked this movie. The scenery, as well as the hotel, were absolutely gorgeous. This movie had both suspenseful and funny moments and kept the viewer highly entertained. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars. I liked it as much as Stephen King's Rose Red. We visited the Stanley Hotel this summer (the inspiration for the Overlook Hotel in the book and movie). I bought this movie on Amazon for my mom right after our trip - she wanted a momento of the hotel. If you are looking for an entertaining ghost story on a Friday night at home, make it Stephen King's The Shining. Once you check in, you don't check out!!"
4,More true to the book,"I liked this miniseries better than the orignial movie. It followed Stephen King's book more closely and was actually filmed at the Stanley Hotel. I thought Steven Weber was more credible as a guy who is slowly taken over by the Hotel than was Jack Nicolson. This version made you understand it was the Hotel that was evil, not the people."
2,Truly Awful,"Stephen Weber and Courtland Mead are truly awful, although it's tough to be so critical of a child actor.The biggest problem with this miniseries is that, like most King tv movies, the film lacks atmosphere. In particular, the scenes are overlit. In addition, like most King production on which he's a part, the scenes jump to much. The film lack continuity. Just when it builds up, it quickly cuts to another scene.The only redeeming quaility is Rebecca De Mornay, although it's hard to imagine how such a lovely wife would stick with such a loser husband.Kubric might not have adapted King's book acurately, but it was a brilliant film nonetheless. Stephen Kind should have just accepted it and forgone this movie, for it's truly awful."
2,A rare argument against the author's involvement,"Apparently Stephen King didn't like the original Shining because it didn't stick to his book so much. He then wrote this teleplay to ensure faithfulness to the source material. Now, I have seen both Shinings as well as read the book. This version suffers from both late-career-lameness on King's part and tv-version-watered-downness. FWIW, every King TV-adaptation has been 100% non-scary. This fits that bill. It isn't awful, but it's just not good. It isn't intense, it isn't frightening, it isn't thought-provoking. It's just...mediocre. And disappointing."
4,book faithful and filmed at the stanley,"I liked the movie version of the shining alot. This one is different but just as good in some ways. Although tv cannot go as far as the movies can. steven weber really nails it as the father here and the rest of the cast does a fine job. This was filmed at the stanley hotel in colorado , the place where steven king wrote the story. It was a made for tv event and it's done well enough. It's close to the book and if ghost stories are for you then this one should be a good one for you. The dvd looks good too."
1,Take it from a Stephen King Fan...,"...this is one of the worst movies ever made.The acting was just horrible, and the setting was plastic...ugh, the whole thing just reeks. I realize King wanted to make a screen version of this story that follows the book, but in my stubborn opinion, film makers should film their interpretation of the story.We've (most of us, anyways) already read the book, do we really want to sit through the exact thing we just read (but with bad acting)? I for one love the book, and love Kubrick's take on the story. This new version does not compare to either."
1,Painful,"Yeah, this one is faithful to the book, but does that mean it's better than the Kubrick version? The answer in this case, is no. I mean, how can Steven Weber's Jack Torrance compare to Jack Nicholson's amazingly over the top performance in the original? And how can those [fake] looking hedge animals compare with the hedge maze from the original, which worked wonders for the first film, being the setting for the climatic chase and the demise of the lead. How much faster can an axe chop down a door than a damned croquet mallet?? If you want Steven King's The Shining, then go and read the book, but if you want a film version, then I would say that Kubrick's version is the only way to go. Steven King isn't that great at getting involved with the film versions of his novels (remember Maximum Overdrive?).Yes, Kubrick's version may not be faithful, but it's better than this made for TV [stuff]."
2,Not half as good and creepy as Kubicks version...,"Its OK.... worth seeing.Its not half as good as Kubicks version. And the child actor in this one is a good actor, but he has a very annoying voice and its very hard to stop focusing on his lips which never close. Watch it and you will see what I mean."
5,Major doubt - Subtitles,"This doubt of mine goes out to anyone out there who has the Region 1 Dvd: could you please CONFIRM which subtitles can one choose from?I'm very dubious on whether to pick the R1 or R2 version of this dics, please help me out.Thanks."
1,Is this a joke?,"I'm actually not suprise that mokst people who reviewed here liked this mini-series, it was a straight forward, laughable, horribly acted, horribly scripted, movie of the week. Anyone who even says this does justice to the book (which was good but not great too begin with) is clearly in need of booking themselves on Dr. Phil. Look deeper in the Kubrick which brims with hidden meanings and themes that this mini series sorely lacks."
1,Walt Disney Pictures Presents.....,"Bad. Just plain bad. The acting is awful. Mick Garris is an excellent technical director, but he has no control over his cast. This is like watching some cartoon. Stick with the book or the 1980 version."
1,ps:,"the book isn't supposed to be like the movie, if it was, there'd be no purpose, it'd just be dumb, and there would be no purpose in even having a director.anyone who goes through a movie and picks and says 'that wasn't it in the book!' or 'that wasn't supposed to happen' needs to get a life"
1,"C'mon, was there ever a good T.V. miniseries?","Simply one of the most awefully boring movies I've had the displeasure of laying my eyes on. Sure it follows the book more closly than Kubrick's version, but that doesnt make it better. Stale acting and unbelievable situations are all you'll get out of this movie, trust me, see Kubrick's or none. This movie is STUPID."
1,Oh my God!!!!!!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, the original was a million times better. I will say that this version followed the book more closely, but the casting was horrible. Stephen Weber, and Rebecca De Mornay have been excellent in other roles, but in this movie, they suck. Pour direction most likely.The hardest thing to endure about this version is the absolutly pathetic preformance (if you could call it that) from the child who was cast to play Danny. If the film had a buget over a buck twenty five they should have went with Haley Joel Osment, now there is a kid who can act!! Buy or rent at your own risk, but what ever you do, don't expect a whole lot. This movie is made for people who watch Glitter, Scream, and Ghosts of Mars. A horror finatic should stay away.Trust me!!!"
2,I'll take the original please...,"Rebecca De Morany is better looking than Shelley Duvall. Definitely. However, that's about the only way this version of ""THE SHINING"" is better than the original.Perhaps one of the biggest reasons why is that the original falls under a category of ...oh, something like SCARY!!! Jack Nicholson's maniac performance is brilliant but it is also terrifying. The bathtub scene is unparalleled in its nastiness. And the maze? What happened to the maze? I realize that it wasn't in the original King novel, but they could have left that magnificent sequence in. (Anything was better than those ""very, very scary, very, very real-looking"" lion-shaped shrubs that came alive!)The illustrious Stanley Kubrick is rolling in his grave. It makes me quite sad that he lived to see this mockery of his original 1980 masterpiece. (Maybe - with any luck - he missed it.)"
3,The Shining TV mini-series,"Unlike the Kubrick movie, this follows the book very closely. It's good to put the Kubrick movie out of your mind before watching this. The acting is okay but gets pretty bad and completely unconvincing at some points. This was made for TV and had a limited budget so I'm giving it a pass on a lot of things. Look, I loved the book, saw the movie many times and loved it, and I'm happy I got to see version. If you're a fan of The Shining, it's totally worth your time (all six hours worth) to watch. The coolest thing is that this movie was filmed at the Stanley Hotel which influenced Stephen King to write the book. King wrote the book after having strange experiences at the hotel."
5,Not for the ignorant,"Anyone who would put this movie down over the Kubrick version should have their head examined, or at the very least read the book, for it is there that the truth comes out, Kubrick's version is a butchery of one of Stephen Kings most personal tales. Stephen King finally did right by doing it himself. Yes, Kubrick was a great director, and yes Nicholson is one of the greatest actors of all time, but the book was thrown out when they made that movie."
2,Poor,"This is direly hamstrung by the network's prurience over bad language or violence. Rebecca De Mornay's Wendy is more like a post-feminist 90s female crusader than a teacher's wife, a scripting decision patently done 'by the board'. Webber, an actor who I like, is inadequate for the Jack Torrance role - he simply hasn't got the depth.A sugary confection best-avoided and by no means a definitive version of the excellent book.That said the dead woman in the bath is one of the most frightening things I've ever seen rendered on screen, and knocks even Kubrick's creepy version of the scene into a cocked hat. Neither is faithful to the book."
1,blech,"dont waste your time with this movie. the movie is accurate to the book but a good movie is a good movie. and this is not a good movie. i highly reccomend the 1980 Kubrick version of the shining to anyone who has not seen either. i reccomend this movie to anyone who has recently had a full frontal labotamy. Stephen King is an author, not a director. he should stick to what he does best--writing.a complete waste of time to even review."
1,a crappy flick,"yeah it is closer to the book, but you people who want the creeps and terror of the book...READ THE F**KING BOOK!! that way you don't have to watch this junk. the stanley kubrick version is 100000000000000000000000000000000000 and more times better than this crap. this was long, tedious, and quite a chore to sit through, whereas kubrick's version was scary as hell and nightmarish. and the thing that pisses me off the most, is HOW THE F**K CAN YOU PLAY TORRANCE'S ROLE WITHOUT JACK NICHOLSON!!!?????? his performance was terrifying. the scenery,the music, those 2 little girls, the blood in the elevator, none of that is in here. it sucks. for a great stephen king story, read the terrifying and excellent book. for a terrific and over the top scary movie, watch the classic shining. for a piece of junk, watch this version. you can't remake a classic."
1,Please just STOP!!!!,"Let's just start off by saying that i wasn't too fond of the original either, but really...... why'd they screw it up even more?!?!?!?!? It was pretty good when it first started, some parts were way too boring, some good parts, and ALOT of overthinking!!! If i were you i'd save my money, rent it, or borrow it from a friend. WAAAYYY TOO LONG and a waste of my time. With all of these good reviews i thought i'd try it out but i was completely wrong!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY..... PLEASE!!!!"
4,Enjoyed,I enjoyed this version of The Shinning. Although the Kubrick version will always be my favorite if not most favorite movie. This version adapted from Stephen Kings novel seemed much more thorough. And the characters made a little more sense and casting was great also.
4,"Love this version, can't stand the movie...","I'm so glad King spent the time and trouble to make this miniseries. I was so excited years ago when they made the movie of the Shining and then when I saw it, felt terribly let down--first, Jack Nicholson just doesn't work for the main character, and second, Kubrick--while a fantastic film maker (most of the time) missed the mark and took the story in a totally different direction. Even with the small screen/smaller budget, by far and away this is a much better version and is faithful to the book. I also prefer the characterization in this miniseries to that of the movie, and just overall felt it was far stronger and creepier in the way it was supposed to be."
5,Very true to the book written by Stephen King!,"This is a great movie if you are the type of person who likes a movie about a book to be true to the book. In The Shining that was done by Stanley Kubrick, it was his ""interpretation"" of the book by Stephen King. And although it was a great movie on its own, it was not at all very true to the book. In this movie, which was a 3 night mini-series on ABC, Stephen King was allowed to make it almost exactly like the book he wrote, simply because there was enough time to! The book was amazing, and this movie will creep you out at times, and entertain you to the max! It is a great story. You will not regret buying this dvd!"
4,Stephen King's The Shining,"This is the remake of The Shining. I liked it better than the first movie, especially after reading a Stephen King article where he stated that this version was more like the book. Although I like Jack Nichelson, I've always felt he was too ""over the top"" in the first movie. The actors in this remake were more believable."
2,Staying faithful doesn't save it!,"Whether this 1997 ABC television movie version was entirely faithful to Stephen King's original novel is almost irrelevant. The film is doomed from the start for two reasons; the minor being that when you have the now-classic 1980 Stanley Kubrick/Jack Nicholson version (faithful or not!) looming in the shadows like a parasite, you can't possibly expect to come close. The major reason being, simply put, it wasn't scary; not even a little bit.If you're making a Stephen King TV movie out of a Stephen King book that's supposed to be scary, and it ISN'T, then it's project over! Not that it can't be done on TV, though. IT and THE STAND were effectively frightening in all the right places. And if you can remember the original SALEM'S LOT on CBS back in 1979; Hell, that was so scary, it could have passed for a theatrical horror film!"
4,"Deron, you are wrong.","This version very closely follows King's intent and storyline. In the novel, Jack Torrance DID NOT freeze to death in the maze like the Kubrick/Nicholson version but DID die when the boiler-room blew up, which is exactly what this newer version shows, correctly. Plus, Jack Torrance DID carry around a croquet mallet towards the end, not an axe, like the Kubrick version falsely showed. Finally, Jack Torrance DID NOT say ""Here's Johnny"", no matter how good Nicholson did it in the Kubrick version.Whenever one tries to make a movie or mini-series out of a novel, they should keep as close to the original storyline, and thus, the author's intent, as possible. Therefore, I'll take this 4 hour Stephen King certified version over the 2 hour 20 min Kubrick version any day. I own both versions and this version is the one that I refer as the novel's companion."
3,Great dvd for the price!,This is a very good movie from beginning to end and follows the book unlike the original 1980 movie.You get commentaries and extra scenes.The cast are very good.Of course how can anyone replace Jack Nickelson. But the actor here who does gives a gentle performance that makes the horror that follows scary. If you love the book and the 1980 movie you'll love this remake.At this low price you have nothing to lose.
4,True to the Book,"The movie is very true to the original novel. A few movie mistakes, but doesn't take away from the film. My fiance loved it as a Christmas present."
5,The Women In The Bathtube,So I have seen both versions of The Shining. Both versions sent a chill down my spine I thought they where both well done. Stephen King's The Shining I remember watch in high school late at night on the TV. Don't worry I went to boarding school What I liked about Stephen King's The Shining was how much it came to life. The part I remember the most which made me jump of the sofa and hide was the women in the bath tube she was so scary. Any bone who loves to jump off the chair and be scared to death then is the movie for you.
3,Just buy the Dover edition,"This appendix is included in the Dover edition of the book, which is cheap. Buy that instead."
4,gaps,"From personal experience, the writer speaks of the similarities and differences between healthy parental affection and sexual affection. I am sure that many parents can relate with what the author says.In one chapter, she says what needs to be said about sexual abuse hysteria in the United States. (That's one reason I'm overseas: to escape from the sexual abuse hysteria!)However, the author also neglected a great deal of research on children's features and gestures which tend to arouse parental affection. For those interested in the subject, I recommend the work of Lorenz (0674846311),Eibl-Eibesfeldt (020202038X), and Guthrie (0442229828)."
2,Flash problem,I was not very pleased with this flash. When I recieved the flash it was cracked and not the design that I was hoping for.
3,It's Ani...for better or for worse.,"I have to say, this was a lot better than I thought it would be. My best friend hounded me for ages, begging me to start listening to Ani. Hey, I love Tori and Alanis, so Ani DiFranco ought to be the next member of my Goddesses of Music Pantheon.So I listened. I've heard most of Ani's music, but never owned one of her CDS. Out of Range was my first. I enjoyed several of the tracks (""If He Tries Anything"" will forever be the song I associate with Charles de Lint's Crow Girls). However...it only reinforced, in my mind, the kind of militant feminism that has made Ani so poular, and, to my mind, so irritating. It's as though she believes that every man in the world is an abusive, wife-beating, child molester, and that all women are inherently spunky, sweet creatures who need to find their own fire. Perhaps the reason I dislike her so much is that I found my own a long time ago."
4,Excellent introduction to Ani,"This was my first Ani CD when she was touring to promote it back in the nineties. While it's not her best, it's a great introduction to an artist in transition from an acoustic folk singer to something a little more diverse. Her later albums contain broader influences and more complex orchestrations with a greater variety of instruments. I think this album shows that she was beginning to feel the limitations of being simply a girl with a guitar and ready to try something different..."
3,It dropped the phone whenever I got out of my car,If you can remember to take it off before you get out of the car it's OK. It absolutely killed my new AT&T V3 after only one year. It just got dropped on the pavement too many times.
1,Not reliable,"Usually we'd like to take the measurement a few time to make sure we get the correct reading. However, it gives dramatic different reading for each try no matter in rectal or under arm mode."
1,Reads too swiftly,"The thermometer is supposed to take seven seconds to read, however the one I received would only read for about 3-4 seconds. This caused bad temp readings, which never even got up to normal body temperature. I was very disappointed, as other reviews were quite positive. Hopefully this one was an anomoly. I returned to Amazon for a refund."
3,Awesomesauce,"This stuff is the bomb. It is absolutely the best thing you will ever put in your mouth. HOWEVER, I'm really kind of shocked at the price on here; at my local international food market, a box of this almond crush pocky is a mere ninety-nine cents... so while this pocky is definitely delish, I highly recommend going elsewhere for it. It's yummy but it's not $10+ (whatever the price ends up at after factoring in shipping)worth of yummy."
5,the best clamps on the market,"these clamps rock, that's the only way to say it. besse thought of everything when they designed them. although i will say that occasionally the adjustable section of the clamp gets stuck and when your really need to torque down, say in a caul or boards which are badly jointed and need extra pressure, you can't get the extra umph you need and would get with the pony style clamp. but the deep throat on these and the way they cross clamp with other besses is unbeatable. great design. happy customer. i will probably only buy besses in the future."
3,I got the flavor.,"I love The Blues Explosion. However don't get me wrong, I love this CD its just there are a few songs that drag. For me the songs that don't drag make up for those that do, but you still have to wade throught them. I would say that the people that would listen to this Cd are more into punk rock than blues or rock. If you buy this CD I don't think you'll regret buying it ,but you may want to check out the other Blues Explosion CD's first."
3,Broke/Missing pieces,The product itself is a great idea BUT... when I received it the nesting chamber was cracked and the plastic screws were missing. I contacted Hartz and they replaced the parts. When I put it together I found that you can't just connect and go. I had to use something to support the nesting chamber or it would fall off when my very small dwarf hamster went into it. If you don't mind being creative to get a product to work (which I don't) then it's a great buy BUT if you don't then don't buy it.
2,"If you purchase, order some duct tape too.","I bought this product for my daughter's dwarf hamster to go the play city dome. It falls apart very easily. Our hamster escaped twice. The connectors would work better if they locked (they just slide in). We had to put duct tape to keep tubes from falling apart. Now it just looks funny. On the flip side, loved how the tubes can be arranged in many ways (just gotta get creative). The hamster does love going into the cube and going into the wheel."
3,faulty item,I ordered this online as I need some more room for the hamster my kids have to run around as he was getting fat. But i assembled it and one of the pieces nothing will stay conected to as it is faulty. So here i sit with a play city only partially in use. I like the cage i just wish it was more convenient to get a hold of attaching pieces.
1,Not Having Fun,My hamster isn't having fun with this neither is my son. The the purple piece that is supposed to snap the tubes to the cage doesn't work. It is black on the box. Every way I assemble this she is able to get out or worse it starts tilting and I have to grab it before it crashes. She is pleased with the base part of the cage but as for this attachment she is extremely disappointed as are we all. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to keep there hamster. It will fall over more than likely or she will get out.
3,Pretty good recording,"To summarize my view, this is a pretty good recording. If you're a stereophile, check this CD out as it is technically one of the best studio recordings I've heard, with great detail and beautiful rendition of the individual instruments.The performers take a stately approach to one of Dvorak's most exciting works, the Quintet Op. 81. They are excellent technically - but the performance didn't stir me. I compared it directly to the old recording by Clifford Curzon and the Budapest Quartet. The Budapest Qt is not really my favorites but, what can you say, these guys bring it when they play the Op. 81. The recording here is not as passionate and drags a bit. The same criticism can be applied to their interpretation of the the Op. 97 Quintet. A solid performance is delivered, but it could be more lively and impassioned. I will note that I prefer the 0p. 97 recording to the one on the Philips double set done by the Berlin Philharmonic players.A middling but solid release."
3,Book Loving Mom,"If you are a Voyager fan, this book is for you. If you are not a fan, a lot of the details will have little meaning. It gives a little extra insight into many characters and situations, but not much original stuff. Easy and fun read for a Voyager fan and most contributers were good."
2,little entertainment value,"I am a voyager fan who read most of the voyager novels that are out. I had high hopes for this book after seeing so many good reviews. This book has several small stories of different characters written by various writers. Some of these writers aren't very good story teller. Overall, the stories are too fragmented to give much entertainment value. None of the stories connect to each other and many leaves you wondering for more which you won't get. I wouldn't advise getting this book."
5,Quality Clamps,Heavy Duty clamps that get the job done. Large parallel surfaces allow easy clamping. Big enough to take one most jobs.
5,SOUNDS GREAT!,"Forget the rest, including the recent Marco Polo/Naxos recording with the Moscow Symphony. Although only 46 minutes of music, this recording with the National Philharmonic Orchestra, Fred Steiner, conductor is the best. The sound is superb and the orchestra is fantastic. If you own the original 1933 soundtrack CD with Max Steiner conducting, that's fine. You should also own this recording (if you can find it). The Moscow recording although some 76 minutes long is a nice effort but the orchestra is no match for this music. The sound leaves alot to be desired."
3,Be careful of size,"This product will not clamp anthing smaller than 4"" so if you are doing kitchen cabinets with edges smaller than 4"" (corner pieces) is become almost useless."
4,"good tool, needed a little tweaking",The cabinet claw is a pretty decent tool although I had to tweak a couple of small things during the first few times I used it. The handles had a large mold line mark on them that hurt my hands until I filed them smooth. The edges of the drill alignment hole on the side of the claw had to be beveled with a large countersink bit so that my drill/countersink bit would fit into it. The biggest gripe I had was the drill bit that came with it was bent and not very sharp. I was pleased with the good price and shipping that I got on Amazon.
5,Essential clamps for kitchen cabinet installation,"If you are considering these clamps, you can rest assured that they work quite well and there are really no other products like them on the market that I know of. They even come with a drill bit. I have used mine already about two dozen times and always with excellent results. I think these clamps are one of the little pro secrets for doing kitchen cabinets. You just line up your face frames, apply both clamps where you want them, and then drill your pilot hole using the guide built into the clamp. Then swing the guide out of the way and screw in a 2 1/2 inch narrow head decking screw. I used the star drive ones that cost about $12 per hundred and they were well worth it. And here's another tip...dip your screws into some paste wax before screwing in so that the threads do not bind on the hard wood (assuming you're working with oak, maple or cherry hard woods). Great product and just get them now and you will be delighted."
4,Works well...for the right size face frame,"It is important to note that the size range for the stile of the cabinet is 1.5 to 2 inches...the stiles (vertical frame piece) on my cabinets were slightly under 1.5, so I had to use shims with these clamps, which is a bit of a pain. Nonetheless, they do a great job of drawing the cabinet frames completely tight, while allowing you to make slight adjustments towards and away from the wall, so that the alignment is perfect...and then allow you to drill and insert trim-head screws to keep that perfect alignment.I guess my only complaint/suggestion would be for Pony to either make another model for smaller frames, or extend the size range down just a bit."
2,"Nice thought, poor implementation","The Cabinet Claw's are a great idea. Problem is they didn't think about someone doing custom cabinets where the finished joined face frame is 1 1/2"" (the same size as the rest of the face frame). It assumes you are joining 2 - 1 1/2"" frames rather than 2 - 3/4"" frames totaling 1 1/2"". As they have designed them, the minimum size for the two combined face frames is just slightly less than 3 inches. I'm returning mine as they won't work for what I need."
4,Fantastic tool,"I used these recently to install a bunch of base cabinets. It went very quick and I was impressed with the quality and usefullness of the clamps. Can you install cabinets without them? Absolutely. Do they make it easier? No question. The only drawback to using these is that the hole for pre-drilling the holes for the screws is deep enough that you can't totally see the hole when the bit is drilling. Not a big deal for just predrilling the hole but a bit of a pain if you are drilling with a countersink bit for the head of the screw. I overdrilled with the countersink bit a few times because I couldn't see how much wood I was eating. I'm sure this wouldn't be a problem if you simply took your time and drilled a tiny bit at a time. As I said, it only happened once or twice."
2,Be careful of imitations,"My friend loaned me these so that I could install face framed cabinets I made....the ones he loaned me worked wonderfully...and I was so impressed I decided to buy a pair....needless to say, they were not of the same quality/construction as the ones he loaned me....they were an inferior quality....I guess you get what you pay for...next time I will buy from a reputable company like Woodcraft or Rockler. Bottom line...be weary of inexpensive/cheap pricing...the old saying is true sometimes....""you get what you pay for."""
5,Cabinet clamps,"Does exactly as advertised. Helps pull the face frames together and into alignment, allows you to drill a centered hole, flip the hole jig away, and install a screw, all while clamped. Our only gripe is that you need a longer drill bit to do this in one operation, a standard drill bit doesn't go quite deep enough. We solved that by using the jig to drill a centered hole as far as possible, flipping the jig open, and drilling deeper, then installing the screw.A jobbers' length drill bit would solve this, used with a flag or depth stop.Pony 8510BP Cabinet Claw (2-Pack)"
4,Cabinet alignment tool -,"It's like having a extra helper when hanging cabinets,butfor the price, the quality of the clamp could be better."
2,Beware of plastic,Worked well until the plastic wing which swings in and out of place for hole drilling and screw placement cracked. Once cracked a few more uses and it sheared sending a little ball bearing and spring into outerspace.Mine were purchased over a year ago hopefully the manufacturer has changed the design of this fragile part.
4,An Essential Tool,If you are installing cabinets this is one tool you do not want to be without. Works well but you may need more than two if your cabinets are large or if fighting with a really uneven floor.
5,Great Product,Life saver when putting my cabinets together. My friends have already asked to borrow. Just take your time when tightening to make sure everything is flush on the front.
3,Cabinet Clamps,"Although I like the product, one of the clamps' screws is sticky. Little disappointed but not worth the hassle to return."
4,Cabinet Claw makes cabinet alignment simple,"Product is a bit pricey, however it makes aligning your cabinets a breeze! If you are installing a set of cabinets where there are more than one side by side this clamp eliminates all of the heartache of getting the face frames lined up.The clamps are not fancy in any way but very functional. Your minimum material with width is about 2 7/8"" (aprox 1 1/2"" for each stile) and you risk damaging your face frame if your try using shims to pull thinner material together. Thickness is not an issue, has clamping capacity of 3/8"" to 1 1/8""If you have more than a couple of sets of cupboard to align, these clamps pay for themselves on the first job!"
3,Nice rack box but...,"This is a nice rack box that does a great job of protecting the equipment inside but, it is very awkward for one person to transport when its fully loaded with gear. You'll need a dolly or another person to help you carry it! It's also has a heavy price (IMHO)."
4,good music always goes unnoticed,"I bought lambhouse, the Unsane best-of/dvd about a month ago. I asked someone for a great heavy album, and he said Unsane. He also says that unsane are THE best band to come out of the 90's. After getting the best of, i believed him. Next time i went into the record store i found this album, then i found out it was out of print, so i asked him to put it on hold for me. Today, about three weeks later, i finally got the money together to buy it, and i am not disapointed. This album is amazing. So amazing, that it pisses me off that it is out of print. Unsane should go down in history as Noise Rock Royalty. They came out of the same scene as Sonic Youth, and though EVERYONE knows sonic youth, NOONE knows Unsane. So if you are in the mood for some hard, heavy music, search out Unsane. Evem though amazon doesnt carry any of their cd's, Scattered Smothered and Covered, Occupational Hazard, and Lambhouse(the bestof) are still out there waiting to be bought."
5,I love it!,"I know some hardcore Ani fans may find this cd to be too mainstream, but I love it. I just love her way with words. Her songs are like poems put to music. She seems so down to earth and it shows in her music. Her work is very fresh and beautiful in a musical climate that's stale and boring...I LOVE Fuel. And, As IS. And, well, the whole cd is great."
5,Her maturity as a singer/songwriter blows me away.,I've been a fan of hers as long as I can remember and she has blossomed into a well known singer that we all can relate to. This CD is her best and possilbly her most expressive yet. Kudos for her and anyone who chooses to buy this CD. Her best work yet!!!
5,one of Ani's best,"This is one of my favorite Ani Difranco albums. I've listened to it many times, alone, loud, dancing around. Its just that kind of album."
5,A fresh and fun disc - Ani makes a statement with a smile.,"I recently saw Ani in concert, and she was sooo cute! She has this bubbly nature that shines through in her work. She is her own source of inspiration and innovation."
4,A nice piece of work,"This is a great album. Although it sometimes lacks the string-popping and guitar-busting energy of her previous albums, it still ranks up there with her best works."
3,Another quasi-masterwork,"3 1/2DiFranco strives at creating consistent, edgy folk punk with a feminist slant, and although she has a distinguished career amongst her peers, has rarely created an album that engages full-throttle throughout. Little Plastic Castles is known as one of her stronger discs, and it does showcase her many talented styles of various acoustic alchemy with little effort. But only about half of the album's material truly stands the test of time, usually centering around DiFranco's excellent up-tempo numbers. Her talent for mesmerizing strum patterns in these songs simply outshines mid-tempo predictability coupled with (at times) strained vocals/lyrics or poetry-styled readings."
2,Other than Gravel.....,"Wow, from the opening notes it is clear something is wrong with this album. It's Ani twisting and stretching toward mainstream. Oh sure, she throws in some political statements that ultimately ground any chances of truly being accepted by the establishment - but boy, what happened to the music? Enjoy the trumpets guys - I'm going looking for something a little more grittier"
1,Bad bad stuff from someone who should know better,"This is the album Ani will look back on and say ""Geez, I'm so embarrassed I did that..."""
2,This one never pulled me in...,"I own Not A Pretty Girl, Dilate, and this album by Ani Difranco. While I thouroughly enjoy the first two--Little Plastic Castle never pulled me in at all really. I've given it numerous listens and still I don't think it remotely compares to the other two albums I own by her. The only song that sticks out to me is ""Gravel"" and even that song I am having trouble recollecting exactly in my mind. I suggest the other two if you are a starting Ani fan. I must admit I'm surprised by the overwhelming popularity of this one."
5,Quite Possibly-The World's Perfect Album,"With the exception of the title track (Little Plastic Castles), there isn't anything that I get even close to disliking. And Little Plastic Castles isn't a bad song it just didn't really ""sing"" to me I guess. I am, admittingly, a Ani Difranco ""rube"", but none the less I am also a music buff who tends to over analyze album. This album has such intricate guitar riffs and stunning production, that is a true must own. And truthfully most ""must own""'s become ""must not hear agains"" after a few years. I am offically writing this review after owning it for 4 years and listing to it hundreds of times.Musically stunning tracks:Two Little GirlsSwan DiveGlass HouseLyrically stunning tracks:Two Little GirlsSwan DiveGravelBest Song (in my opinion):Swan DiveI am trying to be objective and write a truly helpful review, but I really can't find anything I dislike about this album except the annoyingly blue cover."

5,Masterful,"This CD is just amazing. Every song is a delight to listen to, with Ani's beautiful lyrics and catchy music. ""As Is"" alone is worth the price of the CD. Very highly recommended."
4,Alphabetic Indexing Rules Textbook,This textbook was needed for a class I am taking. It arrived quickly and just in time for my class. I am very happy with my purchase.
1,RW Chicago is better,"Don't waste your money on The Real World:Las Vegas book. If you want a good real world book, buy the Real World Chicago book. Chicago was a better and more interesting season."
3,Good insight,AS usual these books describe a lot of things that aren't shown in the episodes and let's you know how some of the roomates really felt about each other.
4,Buy the BOOK!,"I love watching the REAL WORLd LasVegas, this is why i went out and bought it on the day it came out. Yes, it does give a way a few secrets that are currently in the making on the series, but nothing that would make me stop watching the show. I felt like it was interesting and fun to read, but i was expecting more ""behind the scenes"" stuff. i wanted to know more about steven & trishelle. But i still enjoy looking threw it and I even filled out the application in the back!! I reccomend this to anyone...it would be a great x-mas gift for yourself! Buy it online, its pretty expensive at stores... ..."
2,This will do nothing for Clive Barker's career,"Like any other modern horror movie, starts out good but turns into a pile of trash. This movie will do nothing for Clive Barker fans. Its only the good beginning and spellbinding story that saves it from getting one star."
1,YUK!,"A tres typical ""horror"" movie. Not my thing. Unless you enjoy weirdness to the n'th degree, skip this. I still can't believe Bakula agreed to act in this one."
1,"""Lord of...Illusions""","Awful, I hated it. It had the worst acting, special effects, direction, everything. I wanted to exterminate my television after watching this garbage. Please, I don't know why I beg movie producers and directors to stop making trash [movies]this. A cop (Bakula) tries to uncover the murder of a famous magician who is also evil. The cop falls in love with the magician's wife (Janssen) and all hell breaks loose, even in my living room. I need to watch Van Damme instead."
1,Disjointed and senseless,"OK. ""I was born to murder the world.""Why? Are we expected to simply accept that statement? Of course it comes at the very end of the movie, so we're left wondering just who the heck this Nix character is, and what his nature is through the entire film. The problem is, if that was supposed to create dramatic tension, it didn't.Ambitious? Sure. Did it succeed? No. There was unquestionably a story here, but telling the story mainly through the eyes of a private detective wasn't the right way to go about it. This is a problem, sometimes, with writers. They find a story, but then can't find the vessel. I think that's what happened here."
1,"Assistant Night Manager of Illusions, maybe.","It's always nice to watch Famke Janssen, of course, but I like it better when she's either a very smart X-Person or a Bond-busting sadist. This movie really wanted to scare me but sheesh. And the bad guy was like an evil version of Sgt. Carter from Gomer Pyle - totally implausible. I think the problems start in these movies when horror writers direct them."
4,Good movie,"I enjoyed Lord of Illusions. I like Scott Bakula and he was the reason I got the movie. It's a different role for him. He plays a private eye who's hired to help find out about all the deaths occuring in the illusionist world. He runs into several obstacles, but in the end the hero saves the day. I enjoyed the movie and think that anyone who likes Bakula and/or the supernatural world would be interested in this movie. Happy watching to any and all sci-fi movie goers."
4,Clive Barker has done it again.,A top thriller with a good cast.Would definitely like to see Mr. Bakula in more movies like this. Had some definitely good special effects without going overboard. Especially liked the score to the film as a good score always adds a certain eerieness to the movie itself. All actors for the parts they played made you either like or dislike them. Highly recommended for the person who likes this sort of genre in a movie.
2,"Decent Thriller, Weak Script","Scot Bakula From the T.V series ""QUAMTEM LEAP"" stars in this above average thriller about a private eye who specailizes in cases of the supernatural. He investigates a magican's death during his stage act and gets involved with demonic forces from beyond. Good performces but the script can use some work. Lack of dialouge that just seems to be borrowed from horror films of the past. It's not the best movie ever to see but it does contain enough visual/special effects to hold on to the viewer's attention until the final scene."
2,How did this go so horribly wrong?,"You have a ton of great elements in Lord of Illusions. On paper, this project probably looked amazing. Just reading the synopsis, it sounds great! How could it go wrong? Unfortunately, the sum of all those would-be-awesome parts turned into little more than a disappointing let down.The dialog feels off. The actors don't seem to have enough to work with or maybe it's the wrong chemistry. Nothing is thoroughly explained - even for a mystery. Motivations are either hazy or non-existent. There are many ""dead spots"" where the film just kind of drags or loses focus. I don't know what happened, but Lord of Illusions sucks. Just saw it again for the 2nd time. My original viewing was about 10 years ago. It took me about a decade to forget how badly all those cool elements fit together.If you're looking for something even close to Hellraiser, then keep looking. This is probably why Clive Barker stopped making films.Awake!Venger As'Nas SatanisIpsissimusCult of Cthulhu"
5,This movie was great and a must for fans of the supernatural,"This movie was amazing. It mixed the supernatural, a mystery, and horror all in one package. Nothing is what it appears to be, and there is a surprise around each corner, so to speak."
3,Many scenes cut from original viewing.,Can not find director's cut. Movie is bouncy from cut footage
3,his books are much much better,"If you like this film (and even if you dont) you should know that Clive writes the most involving and well thought out plots i have ever read. His books achieve a level of reader involvement that the movies just dont live up to. this movie is based on a short story in one of the books of blood, but my favourite book is Imagica."
3,THE REAL WORLD,"Clive Barker's books have always mystified me...he is definitely one imaginative soul, but at the same time so ""soulless."" In this movie, which he wrote, produced and directed, is soulless. Filled with campy gore effects, MTV style direction, and uneven performances, LORD OF ILLUSIONS is not a fully satisfying horror film. Daniel van Bergen's Nix is well done, but where did he get his powers and why did he lay dormant for thirteen years, and who is responsible for all the bad stuff going on now? And Kevin J. O'Connor, flat as a pancake, seems to be just as bad but why? And HOW did he escape the swords? And why does Scott Bakula act so bored (looking quite buff, though), and Famke Janssen in her pre X-men days looks like a refugee from the Great Gatsby.Nonsensical fun, but Barker continues to be overhyped."
5,Excellent Thriller,"I really enjoyed this film. I have been wanting to purchase it for sometime and I am very glad that I finally did. It is full of suspense and has alot of plot twists in the movie as well. I did watch the special features section of ""deleted scenes"" and felt that there were some deleted scenes that should have stayed in the final cut of this movie. Scott Bakula was a very strong actor in this movie as well as everyone else. I highly recommend this movie for anyone that likes a ""classic"" horror film."
5,Yes...Yes...Yes!!!,"Judith Christie McAllister is one of the most underrated Praise and Worship leaders around. She's phenomenal, and one of my favorites. I've anxiously awaited this new release, and was not disappointed. Now, I must admit that it took playing this CD a couple times to grow on me, whereas I loved her previous CDs immediately. Funny thing is that when I actually listened to the lyrics of the songs on this particular release, I realized that the songs on this CD seem to have a little more depth than songs appearing on her previous two releases. Don't get me wrong, I love all her work; this was just an observation.If you're looking for a foot-stompin' traditional gospel CD, you should pass on this CD. However, if you are looking for some depth in a CD with geniune Praise & Worship with songs based on the Word of God and sung to God, and if you're looking for a CD to help you bless the Lord, even when you don't feel like it, look no further -- this CD will be a blessing to you!"
5,KDD--P&W Leader,"There is nobody like Judith when it comes to praise and worship. Her voice and range is remarkable and she ushers you into the presence of the Lord with every track. ""As your word says it"" and ""One thing"" are wonderful worship songs. As well as ""Zion Rejoice"" and ""Bless The Lord"" are powerful praise tracks. You certainly will not be disappointed. I think this is one of her best. I had the opportunity to see her minister live and the CD does not do her justice for the anointing on her life. She is definitely the ""Queen of Praise and Worship!!!"" Everybody has to get this CD!!!"
2,In his presence live,"I purchased this cd for a particular song, To Our God. The cd is not what I expected at all. It is awful. Completely disappointing."
1,Sad,I really wanted this DVD. She is one of my favorite artist and was very saddened at the fact that I never recieved this DVD. I never got a response from the seller after trying to contact them according to the standards five times. My plan is to never purchase anything from this particular group ever again. THanks
2,This is contemporary gospel.,This is not strong Praise & Worship by any means. If you like Soul Stirring Worship and Strong Praise this is not the CD for you. Boring!
3,Low treadcount,"I think the color and pattern of this set is perfect for either a boy's or girl's room. However, I was surprised at the poor quality (I couldn't find the threadcount listed anywhere, but the fabric is very thin). The colors are very vibrant and has survived its initial wash. Elastic on the fitted sheet is only in the corners. Hopefully, it will last until my daugher moves to a big bed, but I'm doubtful it would last for a second child, which is one of the reasons I purchased something gender-neutral."
3,Not the best physic reference that I've seen,This book has two sections a dictionary of physics termsand a set of biographies with pictures of stamps with thegreat men on them. Actually if I were such a science greatI might resent being one paragraph and maybe a stamp picture in such a book?It is probably good as a quick reference for high school studentsor older people who need to identify a term or name.Over-simplification is always deceptive and can creep up on you like a encyclopedia and fool you into thinking you understand or know when you really don't.
2,What happened?,"Man, I used to love Hoodoo Gurus. Stoneage Romeos one of my all time favorite albums along with ""Blow you Cool"" coming a close second. But ""Blue Cave"" was a real let down. It seems that they are trying for some type of anger album or something. This is by far their worst album. There are maybe 2 songs on the album that are any good, the best being the second song ""Down on Me"". Just look at the ""New and Used"" Blue Cave albums... There is a reason you see it for sale for $1.98..."
2,Remedial at best,"This is one of the weakest scriptwriting book I have ever read. The author's references are dated, and the examples she uses from her own writing (episodes of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" and ""Starsky and Hutch"") are hardly good guidelines for any new writer to follow.The book is useful for its occasional pearls of wisdom (the main character should be in the first and/or last scene of every act), but the beginning writer would be confused by her explanation of structure. As for her guidelines on format and marketing--who knows how much has changed since 1990?A new edition might be worth a look. For the novice writer, though, you're better off learning how to write screenplays and applying that knowledge to television. See authors like Christopher Vogler, Michael Hauge, and Michael Chase Walker."
2,At least it's cheap...,"Not bad or misleading, but this book doesn't compare well with others in this genre.A better title would have been: ""How to Make a Living Through Bad Television.""Examples used include Fantasy Island and Starsky and Hutch. Professionally written, but someone's going to have to spend a few aeons in Art Purgatory for those stinkburgers.To be fair, the generic info is helpful if you have no other information, but there are several better books out there. For sitcoms, try: ""Successful Sitcom Writing."""
4,Enlightening & Insightful,After reading Madeline's book I have a better grasp as to what it takes to write a successful television script. Her examples are clear and right to the point. It makes no difference to me if her examples come from The Bob Newhart or Shakespeare's Othello or Star Wars. This book is one that will stay front and center on my desk and I'll use it as a reference over and over again. You might consider doing the same.
5,A Worthy Successor to the Baring-Gould Original,"For those who love Holmes, as I do, this is a must have item. At age 10 I accidentally received the Annotated Sherlock Holmes by William Baring-Gould and those two volumes have been a treasured part of my life ever since. This new annotation is quite beautifully done, and rarely repeats Baring-Gould's subjects, delving into new subjects and providing new insights into the Holmes Canon and Victorian London life. I must admit that the original has a certain charm that is not to be found here but this is not a criticism, just an observation. I can only hope that somewhere another young person will stumble onto these new volumes and discover the efficient beauty of Conan Doyle's writing, the romantic allure of late 19th century London and find new lifelong friends in Holmes, Watson and their creator."
5,The four novels - in all their annotated glory!,"This volume is a companion to the two-book set that covers the 56 short stories. Mr. Klinger has done an outstanding job of annotating and describing enough details in each novel to delight the casual reader or the devoted Holmes fan. Most Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts consider their annotated edition of the canon to be the centerpiece of their Holmes library. If you enjoy Sherlock Holmes, you will love this edition."
5,Great for first timers and seasoned fans,"This was the first time I read any Sherlock Holmes and I was not disappointed. But what really made the experience such a fun time was the vast number of info accompanying the novels. The notes are right next to the text so you don't have to keep flipping pages, plus various pictures abound throughout the volume capturing the times of Holmes and Watson.After reading it myself, I lent this volume to my good friend who can pretty much recite any line from the novels and he absolutely loved it.So if you are a fan or just curious about all the hype, this is a must!"
1,Did not receive the item.,I have not received this book. I sent an e-mail to the place that was supposed to send me the book and they did not respond.
1,Piece of Garbage,This is a piece of garbage. It lasted just long enough to take about 30 Christmas pictures. Just spend the extra money on the Canon Flash.
1,Digital Concepts 528AF-CAN AF Flash for Canon Digital SLR Cameras,"you get what you pay for,built in flash works better. don't waste your money buy a better one you will be much happier."
4,Quality match the price!,"Build quality is ok for $30 and it is not to bulky. It provides more light than the on board flash from my XTI but will drain the batteries a bit quick, then again that's normal. In the future I will get a canon speedlite but for now this one will due."
3,It's ok. Worth having for a few songs,"As far as the gurus go. This album is good for about 2 or 3 songs. The rest of the album seems like they got too carried away. If you haven't heard the 80's gurus stuff, then start with that."
3,A bitter and angry effort,"The first few times I listened to Crank, I realized the Hoodoo Gurus were publicly displaying their anger and bitterness at not being a super-star band they expected to be. Song's like Nobody, Less than a Feeling and Hypocrite Blues only reinforced the dark bitter brooding that the Hoodoo Gurus were going through. The Right Time is the only good effort on the CD. The rest of the CD wallows in self-pity and anger. Had this been there last CD, it would have been a poor exit note."

2,Desperately miss the hour long versions of this classic,"I too am very disappointed by the decision, whether it was Rhino's or Flip's, to ""edit"" these down from the original one hour presentation to a disjointed 22 minute version. The original hour long version was classic - this is butchered down to skits. There is the evidence of the genius of Flip Wilson but the poorly edited versions just seem so chopped up. It is sad to see these shows ruined."
5,very funny,I used to watch the Flip Wilson show when I was a kid. This brought back memories. Still very funny. Our family enjoyed watching it.
1,A RIP OFF,"I thought this DVD of The Flip Wilso show which RHINO was selling was going to be really funny . I played it and I nearly fell asleep all they did was sit at a table talk and play cards . And when they played a "" funny skit "" Laughable it wasn't ! This DVD would look better in the bottom of a waste basket ."
2,I am incredibly disappointed by this DVD,I am incredibly disappointed by the disc. The description on the packaging clearly indicates that 5 complete shows are included on the disc. Perhaps someone didn't inform Rhino that the Flip Wilson Show was 60 minutes long when it aired on the NBC Network almost 30 years ago. The shows on the disc run about 22 minutes long and are the completely chopped up versions that I could have taped off of TV Land reruns! I have always been impressed with the quality of Rhino products in the past and own many CD's and videotapes produced by them. This DVD does not belong in their catalogue. It is the kind of a product I've seen produced by the people who sell videotapes of old TV shows for $3.99 on the supermarket shelves. I hope Rhino will take steps to correct this in any future editions of this series.
4,The flip wilson show,I remember the show when it was first broadcast and I was wondering if the humor had become dated but it works as good now as it did then.
4,What's your fantasy,"I think that it is a feel-good song for the people that like to express their thoughts and dreams of a good but nasty lover. It makes you really think about what kind of fantasy your mind is capable of. And it makes you think of that one person who makes your toes curl, because he is your fantasy!"
5,A great song,"I think this song is the best. I heard it, and I fell in love with it. I am always requesting it on the radio, and I just love the song. It is great. It is music that you can't dance to. I think everyone should go and buy it."
1,Ludicrous,"If this is what hip-hop/rap has come to, then I give up. This record is a bunch of .... If you like vacant-minded lyrics and stupid ebonics, then this is the cd for you. Listening to ludacris makes me feel like the music industry really has become nothing more than a pop/capitalist machine. No talent, no originality, no clue, THAT is what ludacris is all about."
3,coby radio,This product is great- it works for me. You get what you pay for- a small plastic radio- but it works great and is small/light enough to fit in my pocket.
1,Not Recommended,"If I didn't have to read this thing cover to cover for a lazy teacher's class, I would trash the thing now. It is full of typos and the authors' personal opinions and speculations, presented as facts. You would think that they would have the kinks worked out by the ninth edition, but one wonders why they bothered putting out a new one at all. The book is disorganized and fails to explain terms whose definitions are clearly needed by the reader. Also the entire preface was a glorifying ode to the authors, detailing how awesomely clever they are for having written it. I have seen better historical writing in Cracked articles."
5,A must have for any Audio Engineer,"This book is a must have, period. It doesn't matter if you are a beginner or a seasoned veteran. This book presents a new way of ""looking"" at a mix. For newbies, it is the most concise and logical approach to mixing that I have ever seen. I have read dozens of books about audio engineering and this one just makes the most sense. For those of us who have experience, it really brings a new clarity to what we have always been doing and why we do it, as well as offers a new way to look at things, making it quicker to achieve the same results (in my opinion). Like I said, no matter what level of skill you have, you need this book!"
2,"Pretty, but lacks substance.","I agree with Jason Perry. Lots of pictures, not much content though. I'm sure there are much better books out there that can handle the same information, without the overinduldgence in slick looking, but not very useful graphics. Ideal for absolute beginners, but not worth the money if you're after a serious book on mixing."
1,Look at all the pretty baloons,"Gibson offers a simplistic view of the mixing process - imagining colored spheroids in a 3D space as a way to visualize a stereo mix. There are a couple of good points, but they're buried and not obvious. As a musician and home-studio engineer I found this book mostly useless. It might help someone just starting out, but if you know what a mixer, compressor and effects unit are, read Bobby Owinsky's ""The Mixing Engineer's Handbook"" instead."
2,"I read it at the store, as advised. Worth the free visit.","As suggested in another review, read it at the store for 3 minutes and you've got the idea. Very overpriced for what you get. Could use a lot more information about the knobs to turn and the settings to use on instrumentation to actually get to the pictures that he envisions.OK, the graphics are cool and the idea of visualizing a mix is nice but you could squash the images into 1 chapter and then give more 'meat' for the mixing process. I picked it up ready to buy it and set it down wanting much more."
3,Good idea - but get over it!,"David Gibson's book is based on the standard practice of imaging used by professional mixing engineers. His idea to make visual representations of all aspects of the mixing process is a good one but it seems to be the sum total of the book. Once you understand the essential premise, there is very little else to be gained. Certainly for a beginner it is very useful. A lot of basics are covered, but he is guilty of trying to over-simplify what is a very complex artform. Also, the language used in the book is off-putting in its bubbly, informal style. It is a pity that this idea is so badly executed because it has enormous potential as a teaching tool in conjunction with concrete musical knowledge."
3,Nice Graphics But..,A good book for those with little expience and need to have an overall view of the process. Too much time is explaining anything EXCEPT the mix. The graphics are interesting but don't really make up for the lack of deeper information.
2,Left me with more than somewhat to be desired,"I will agree with most of the reviews that this book's images helped in conveying stereo field information, however, I have two problems with this book:1) The images are exremely redundant and take up half of the already slim 124 pages (where does the publisher get 144 from?)2) The book's content does not justify the price.Contrary to someone elses comment, I found the book to be exremely lacking in the area of compression. On the other hand, it did have some useful info on equalization settings."
3,Leaves somewhat to be desired.,"First a bit of praise. Gibson does make a few good points and the visual diagrams used to illustrate mix density are very enlightening indeed. On the down side, the material covered is repetitive and somewhat basic. My biggest gripe is the price tag, the book is worth maybe half the price. Beginner to Intermediate level. For a more intermediate to experienced level book, I would recommend 'Sound Advice' by Wadhams."
5,Excellent book for the beginner or novice,I'm about halfway through this book and I can already understand why my mixes so far have sounded crowded and muddy. The visual presentation of the material makes the concepts crystal clear right away.
1,nearly useless,"gibson's book is kind of a one trick pony. you instantly get what he's going for and, to be fair, it's a neat idea to visualize music this way. but, if you're serious at all about mixing or even listening to music, you immediately realize that you knew all of this already. my advice would be read this in a bookstore for about 3 minutes and then get Bobby Owsinski's book Mixing Engineers Handbook for some truly useful info."
3,"I have reviewed the dvd version of this book, check it out...","The dvd version of this book is supposed to be an enhanced version of this book , but the production values and the content, all fall short of expectations. If you are interested in the dvd version check out my review page."
5,One Of A Kind Lamps,"It's been 3 months since I've been using these candle subsidiaries, it's unique in-terms of usage, cost, design and lightning, while watching TV or using my computer I usually prefer to use the normal lamp for low light surroundings. But, after I obtained these candle lamps it changed even the mood of the room. It's strange I read many articles of people complaining abut this product in the web. But truly it works perfect!!!! In my opinion don't trust anything you read, some times you found a product have 2 stars but it depends on the person usage and evaluation"
3,surprised!,"On this product that I received, the painting is terrible and it makes usage hard. Also, two holesaws are stuck together and it was hard and strenuous to separate it. All the razors on the blade are uneven. I'm very surprised and unsatisfied that this well-known Milwaukee brand has such terrible workmanship."
5,Additional information,"I was looking for a set of hole saws that would cut through the sheet steel siding of a pole building, but the listing for this item doesn't specify the materials these saws will handle. Both the list price and the brand indicate good quality saws, but I needed to be certain. A search of the web finally found the following:Milwaukee Bi-Metal hole saws are high production tools designed for cutting all machinable materials, including steel, aluminum, copper, brass, sheet metal, stainless steel, wood or plastic.Assuming that the above is correct, this set of saws fully meets my requirements at a very reasonable price."
1,Service is terrible,The service is terrible. I downloaded the CD and could not open on my PC. I was then directed to access the troubleshooting page which did not give me clear directions on how to resolve the problem. I am not willing to spend hours resolving the $7.99 price of this service. In my opinion this service should have not been released to the public. I will never use it again and will think twice about amazon products.
2,Absolute bore.,"Only in case these late 50s (it should be 1958 instead 1968 as listed above) TV-episodes can evoke some personal memories in you, is this DVD worth viewing. Unfortunately I have to describe it, together with some other DVDs from this lot, incredibly boring. Looks poor Boris was in bad need of money, he looks so uninspired. The technical quality of these DVD-s are nothing much to boust about as well. So, don't expect anything but nostalgia here. No nightmares, no destination."
4,"Surprisingly Good, Very Practical","Colorful guidebook has marvelous images that create an immediate illustration of Bali and Lombok.While the practical references are a bit truncated (foreign embassies listed are only Australia and USA; hotel & restaurant listings are scanty), the cultural & special interest tips are excellent.The guide works its magic by tying photos to text. The reader can zero in on an image and immediately see the relevant text. This is a highly practical format, leaving no mystery as to whether some place or item may be of real interest to the individual reader. Therefore, reader can figure out what he/she wants to see & do without slogging through chapter upon chapter of text.I spend a lot of time in Bali and I think this is probably the most useful guide for the average traveler to Bali & Lombok. It has quite a few entries....If you have a limited amount of time in Bali, and an even more limited amount of time to prepare for it, this guide will suit you very well indeed!"
5,AMAZING BOOK,"Great pictures, nice fun facts about the island and customs of the people. Best part is definitely the visual. Great Great Great pictures and maps!"
2,Skip this Skip Langdon Novel,"Although I am a fan of Smith's work, I found this one to be a bit contrived and convoluted. There were too many sub-plots that demanded more attention than Smith could give in a light mystery novel. The character of the baroness is exciting, though and as always, New Orleans is romantic and seedy all at the same time. Read the earlier books in the Langdon series to get a better example of Smith's work."
3,Light and fluffy...,"After reading several heavy duty histories, I needed something light, fast and entertaining and Julie Smith's 82 Desire fit the bill. This was my first Skip Langdon mystery, and I was very charmed with this book. Yes, there are much better mysteries, but I love New Orleans and it was fun to read a story set in this unique city. The characters could have been developed a little better, but perhaps they are in earlier books from this series. I especially liked the Baroness Pontalba. This will definitely not be my last Julie Smith."
3,Would never miss a Skip Langdon but Smith has done better,"In this installment in the series, there is a lot less Skip and a lot more other characters. Perhaps if Langdon dumped her somewhat uninteresting boyfriend or Smith tried to develop the two of them more, it would work better but the personal relationships were ho-hum in this one. The mystery shared some similarities to the type of material Sara Paretsky's V.I. Warshawski usually handles; i.e. corporate crime. After Errol Jacomine as a villain, these criminals seemed more vanilla than villain. I liked the character of the Baroness and her subplot because I always enjoy the odd tidbits of New Orleans lore that Smith includes, but there were several other avenues that Smith started to go down characterwise that petered out. Write 5 books that the reader can sink her teeth into rather than 1 book that just lets her taste. I hope the next one is an improvement because I don't want to give up on Skip and Smith yet."
4,Great CD set!,"I first saw Tempest when they opened for Outgrabe at The Starry Plough in Berkeley, many years ago. They were fun, great performers, and had a wonderful fiddle player. I liked them immediately, and bought a CD that night. Over time, that CD has grown to many, and I've come to have very fond feelings for this band. This box set really captures the Tempest sound, and it's a pleasure to add it to my library."
5,Future Wordsmiths,"Dr. Templeton (University of Nevada at Reno) of Words Their Way fame recommended this book to me because I teach seventh graders who like to use big words on people. They like to know big words, their contextual and denotative meanings, and they use them every chance they get. For instance, one of our November words was ""tractable."" My students loved this word because they are learning the fine art of looking calm and in control on the outside--even if they are the exact opposite on the inside. One student told her mother that she was just going to have to be tractable about going to a relative's house over the holidays.If you like to know about words beyond their definitions, this is an excellent resource. If you teach school and want to captivate your students, you most certainly need this book and several others like it in your classroom collection. You can marvel at students who grab word origins books when there is independence time in class!"
4,this is what she does,"this album is smart. i prefer it to the other ani difranco albums i own for the reason that i find it honest and open. ani difranco knows how she feels and she wants to tell people. not necessarily for pity, more because she wants us to know. it's cool. the raw acoustic power of this album is somehow threatening yet comforting. very very beautiful."
5,Lovely,"""Not a Pretty Girl"" is the first Ani album I ever bought, and even though I have acquired more, it remains my favorite. I remember sitting in my room after I bought the cd, and listening to ""Tiptoe"" lead into ""Cradle and All"" on repeat. I knew this was it. It is hard to articulate how incredible this piece of work is. The album will transport you to another place when you listen to it. ""Shy"" is my favorite track, lyrically and musically. If you are looking to dive into the lush collection of Ani Difranco albums, I would start with this cd. It will leave you yearning for more Ani and prepare you for what she has to share. By the way, if you have a chance to hear this woman live, do it!"
2,It's hard to quantify...,"but there's just no beauty in the words or melodies on this CD. It's the first CD I've picked up by Ani, and, I'm disappointed to say, the last."
5,"i am not a pretty girl, that is not what i do",What eles can i say other than... ANI DIFRANCO IS SO WAY BEYOND THE BEST!!!! this is one of her many great albums that are always good nd if not better than the last. You defintly need to check it out.. its awesome...
3,Not a half-bad album,"Reading the other reviews here, I had high expectations when purchasing this title. I must say that I was slighlty disappointed when I listened to it. It still has the same sound that we have come to expect, respect, and love from Ani, but lacks the obvious intensity put forth in Dilate and Little Plastic Castle. Memorable songs off of this album include Worthy, Light of Some Kind, Not a Pretty Girl, The Million You Never Made, and 32 Flavors."
5,this is *MY* ani,i call the song not a pretty girl *MY* song. i can relate to it. have you ever heard a song that is so incrediable that it just blows you off you feet. that it is like thay had you in mind when they were writing the song. that is the way that i feel with this song. yes i must say that this song is *mine*
5,a must buy,"this i my favorite ani album. I can listen to it on repeat for months at a time and not get sick of it. It is one of those albums where if you lose it, you'll fork out the money to replace it because once you have it you won't be able to live with out it."
5,Ani's most expressive album yet,"Mainstream music is like pot: you smoke it and eventually you feel it. Ani is like hard core drugs, where you get the rush full on and right away. This album expresses her angst with herself, and everything she deals with the listener can identify with. One of her best."
5,In the middle,"This album always seemed to me like it was the crossroads of Ani's music. You could hear her music style change with every new album i.e. Out of Range and Puddle Dive, but it was in this album where she really seemed to get in touch with the anger and angst inside of her. I highly suggest you listen to this album if you are in an angry and political mood, every Ani album is made to fit a different type of mood you are in. This album is personal political and poetic by far one of her best. And by far one of the most mature, with out being too mature..."
5,Difranco covers a wide range of tones and emotions,"Since her appearance in the national music scene, Ani Difranco has had a cult following. This album is not only for her devoted fans, but will also appeal to the uninitiated. She shifts styles almost schizophrenically from one song to the next, but still maintains focus throughout the album. Her up-front, blunt, come-as-you-are style in ""Cradle and All"" and ""Shy"" contrasts with her regret in ""Sorry I Am"". The title track seems to fulfill all the riot-grrl rumors about her and then confounds them with the statement ""I am not an angry girl / But it seems I've got everyone fooled / Every time I say somethin they find hard to hear / they chalk it up to my anger / and never to their own fear."" The light-hearted ""This Bouquet"" and the mellifluous ""Hour Follows Hour"" further demonstrate Difranco's seemingly limitless range, and her spoken pieces ""Coming Up"" and ""Tiptoe"" add to the eclectic truth of this album."
5,It makes my heart stop,"'Not A Pretty Girl' was the first Ani album I heard. Usually you can't remember where you were and what you were doing when you hear an album, but I remember being driven home from work and going 'Oh my god. what have I been missing and where do I go from here?' Nearly every song on this album is flawless, the only exception being 'The Million You Never Made', which drops to angry self-righteous flailing about after a while. But the other songs-- how can I describe the beauty of the title track, 'Shy', 'Asking Too Much', and 'Hour Follows Hour' without sounding sappy and obsessive? Truly, this album affected my perspective more than I can explain. I had been told of Ani because I liked Alanis Morissette. Let me tell you something-- Alanis wishes she was Ani."
1,"No gauge, no value","There are really only three things I would expect in a bike pump:1) It has to have the proper valve2) It has to have a gauge3) It has to last.I will never figure out if it meets #3 since without a gauge, this thing is useless. It is going back. Avoid this model."
5,"Fun, romatic, well done","One of my favorite cds. It has a great mix of fun songs, lovely ballad, and simply well done music."
3,"It's good, but not great Ani","Ani DiFranco has done some great things musically, and some that just aren't particularly memorable. This isn't real memorable. ""In and Out"" has a great groove and ""Imperfectly"" is a darn fine song, but most of the work on here lacks either the intimacy of her self-titled debut or the punch of Puddle Dive and other later albums. ""Every State Line"" is a great little poem, but you can get a much better, musical version on Living In Clip, so why bother here? A good CD if you're a fan, but not one likely to hook a newcomer to Ani."
5,tied for my favorite,"This album is one of her least popular, but i dont know why. Its so great from beginning to end no matter what mood your in. It has some of my favorite songs by the great one herself(the waiting song, make him apoligize). Two of my very favorites. The whole album is so perfect. Its a joy from beginning to end."
5,Ani at her best,I absolutely love Ani and if I could only own one of her albums this would be the one . This is a must for not just her fans but anyone of folk music .
4,"Not as good as others, but still great","This is my 2nd Ani CD, I got it actually after getting ""Little Plastic Castle"" recently. It didn't leave me quite as satisfied as LPC did, but if you're an Ani fan you'll like it."
5,"I LOVE ALL HIS MUSIC, HE'S THE BEST , PERFECT !!!!!!!!!!!!","I love this CD and the Artist ever since i was a child i grew up listening to his music. I do not just love this CD but his music in all. He can relate to life and situations through his Music, and it is the kind of music you do not get tired of listening to. Best of all it is the kind of music for all ages."
5,"Originally purchased for Maynard song, but love it!","I bought this CD because I am a fan of Tool. I didn't know what to expect from the other songs on this CD, but after listening to it a few times through, you begin to wiggle your bum to it which proves it's a good album."
2,AUthor Author,"DVD was delivered in good time, faster than stated. DVD was in good condition. HOwever was disappointed to find that the DVD version crops off the original beginning and 10 minutes off the end. The oriinal screen and VHS version ends with a celebration the next day in Ivan's bedroom with the kids hitting Ivan with a cake! The DVD version ends on the street the night before in front of the news stand. Disappointing."
1,Not worth your money: this DVD is missing the final scene of the film!,"Let me get this straight: I really like this film alot. It is a rare Pacino-comedy and he is really good in it. But this DVD version is not worth your money. Why? Well, for some reason that only Fox executives can understand, they cut the final scene from the film - even though it was really funny, heartwarming and a perfect ending for the story. So, until those people at Fox Home Entertainment get their mind right and decide to release the film in it's integral version, you should not buy it. Simple as that."
2,Cut Scenes,"Does anyone know why FOX dropped the last scene from the the DVD release?I notice that other reviewers are baffled too, so any info posted here would be helpful. Thanks."
2,Where's the ending!!!!,"I finally find one of my all time favorite Pacino movies on DVD only to have the ending scene cut!! Why the hell are things like this done?! DVDs are supposed to offer special features, cast interviews and missing scenes. Maybe when the next version of this movie is released it will contain the missing scenes from this release!!! A BIG disappointment!!"
2,THIS ISN'T THE ORIGINAL MOVIE! DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"I love this movie and waited a long time to order the DVD. I finally ordered it and how it's here there are subtle changes that kind of sour the ending.In the video version, Pacino and the kids are at home instead of on the street. I won't say more than that, but the 'sweetness' of the ending is missing.This isn't the first DVD that's been altered, leaving one wondering why the editors have to mess with the original when it's good as it was before.Boo on the 20th Century Fox for screwing up when they reformatted from VHS to DVD.PS- MAYBE AMAZON COULD ASK THE VENDORS TO STATE WHEN THE PRODUCT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL"
3,Not one of his best...,"This is not one of Al's best films. However, he is the greatest actor of his generation. So, you will want to add this one to your Pacino dvd collection."
4,Entertaining comedy,"An okay comedy starring Al Porcino as a struggling playwright who must deal with a neurotic wife (played by Tuesday Weld) and a brood of kids (all Weld's by previous marriages) while trying to get his play produced. The movie bounces along nicely enough and as long as one doesn't probe too deeply beneath the surface it's pretty entertaining. It's typical of a ""kind"" of picture that seemed in vogue during the early 80s, which depicted the breakup of the family as adult characters tried to pursue their work and ""find"" themselves at the same time. In this movie it's the kids who have all the best lines, seem more sure of themselves, and have things all figured out, while Porcino and Weld act clueless. Maybe some things never change."
1,False Advertising,"The ""22 AWG"" cable was actually 26 AWG. I did not want such a small cable. They do not offer a 22 AWG cable and would do nothing for me. I call this false advertising!"
3,Competent,"It's a perfectly usable jack. I wish it had a larger range, and possibly a wider base. It got my Honda Ridgeline's tires off the ground before I added a 2"" lift. I don't think it will now. Easy to use and seems constructed well."
3,fairly effective,"kills fleas but the effect is short. recommend for immediate relief , not for long lasting, other than that, it is a good product."
2,Does not exactly fit a 2001 Honda Civic 4 door car,"It was time to retire my old Honda cloth floor mats on my 2001 Honda Civic and I decided to try the WeatherTech. The main thing I was searching for in floor mats was a custom fit and the ability to attach to the safety hook on the driver side (the hook that prevents the mat from moving forward and pushing on the accelerator). So after some research, I purchase the weathertech and now I am disappointed. The driver side mat is 3 inches short from attaching to the hook. The mat appears heavy enough to stay in place, but I rather be safe then sorry. I should of bought the Honda rubber floor mats!!UPDATE (1/5/2011):One year later, the mats are durable and I am still using them. The mats do slide slightly forward towards the accelerator, not to the point I would throw these things away. But I would recommend anybody thinking of trying these outs to consider another brand."
3,Poor fit,Poor fit on 2000 Honda Civic LX 4-door. I expected better after having checked on the manufacturer's website to confirm that the product number on Amazon matched the product number suggested by the manufacturer.
5,A Winner!,If you only buy one of Ani's CD's I recommend this one. I love all the songs and enjoy playing it often. I think it is a good example of her work.
5,couldn't stop playing,"this is one of those albums that if you get attached to it will never let go. even though i'm not an ani fan as ardently as i once was(still love her, but she no longer recieves my nightly prayers) i can still stick this cd in the machine and sit back and enjoy the wonderful song. one of the few truly ""folk"" albums that i love."
5,i'm listening to this cd right now,"i try to listen to it at least once a day, if not more... because each time i hear this cd, i hear something new. every one of her songs speaks to me- i bought this cd after being an ani fan for quite a while, and when i put this in my stereo, i nearly started to cry. this album is the reason why we ani fans are so loyal- because she is real. her reality isn't censored or compromised... it's straight up, and it speaks the truth. this album is personal... like your best friend came over with her guitar, sat down, and decided to tell you exactly who she is. an amazing beginning...."
4,Be Leery,"I bought this album, after having Revelling/Reckoning and To the Teeth, two of her later albums. They are both rather funky and and beat driven, with a very defined style.I bought this album expecting the same, and was a bit dismayed when I found out that it was all her and her acoustic guitar. It took me some time to get used to it, but once I did, (after some time) I enjoyed it quite a lot.It may be harder for some listeners, so be careful when buying it. If you have trouble getting into it, listen to Both Hands, Work Your Way Out, Rush Hour, Fire Door and The Story. They are more accessible to listen to than the rest.If you do buy it, I hope you enjoy it and come to like it."
5,ani is the most amazing artist ever,"i actually don't own this cd. but i do own ""like i said"" which has many of the songs from this cd and ""not so soft."" i am constantly amazed by the power ani has. her poetry speaks to me as much as the great sylvia plath... but ani holds the key many of my mind's dreams. no words can possibly explain how her music has changed my life. i love her. 'fire door' and 'both hand' are so perfect in poetry and music that i am blown away every time i listen to them. everyone needs ani in their life, everyone."
5,The first and the best,"I remember when you couldn't find Ani anywhere! My boyfriend had a mix tape with ""Talk to Me Now"" and ""Out of Habit"" included and I searched high and low to find her. My parents finally did after months of searching. They bought 3 of her CD's for me. This just happens to be my favorite. So raw and natural. She was only 19 I guess when she produced this CD and she was already so insightful. I remain impressed with Ani even though I no longer listen to her on a regular basis. She doesn't have much to say to me anymore, BUT, whenever I listen to this CD, I remember where I've come from and how far I've traveled since then. The two tracks I mentioned previously are the best on the CD. Her poem, ""The Slant"" is also excellent. How could she know all this at such an age? I miss Ani and her guitar... just the two of them piercing my heart with their sincerity and their fearlessness."
5,Ani at her most beautiful,"This is no doubt my favorite Ani CD. Every song on it is so absolutely heartfelt, and with such amazing lyrics too- it's like Ani was born to make music. And Ani's best song is on this album too: Firedoor. Everytime I hear this song, it brings tears to my eyes because it's so honest and true. This is a must-have for any true Ani fan. Get it."
1,Feels like a toy,"I don't like the case. When I put it on my Razr it looked like a child's toy. The plastic makes it look tacky. The case is too tight. Just so one knows, the case is two pieces held on by buttons. They're not shown in the picture but the buttons are on the back. When it's in one piece, it's difficult to open the phone. Looks attractive online but in reality, it looks silly."
5,favorite story since 1,"This is a wonderful story, which flows and rhymes, amusing to read. It also reminds me of my own childhood stories. It was the first story my daughter understood, and has been her one of her favorites since she was one. Now, she tells me the story, and still loves it. I would recommend it parents who wants to read nice stories to their children. Coincidently, ""The Pobble Who Has No Toes"" was also another favorite, and I just recently noticed they were written by the same author. Now, I am going to get more books by Edward Lear."
2,"Don't ask me, I don't give a damn","I adore Country Joe, but Vanguard Visionaries is an extraordinarily disappointing series, given that the label is being so stingy with its offerings. The label has an excellent roster. If they wanted to publicise their archives, they could have been a great deal more generous at this price - or else offered it for $6 or so. It's also disappointing that Vanguard is ignoring some of the wonderful stuff in its archives and focusing instead on meaningless releases of this variety - the ""greatest hits"" by the same artists, on the same label, are a much better deal."
1,Ignorant authors.,"The authors don't believe in Qi Gong (Chi-Chung). They think Qi Qong is a strange form of exercise. They classify acupuncture in the witch craft category. They think the meridian point are pure B.S.It's like a guy, who doesn't believe airplane can actually fly, to write a book about Wright brothers. Since the guy obviously never seen an airplane or taken flight in an airplane, and sincerely believe all the airplane in air news are hoax. What kind of books do you think he'll come up with biography of Wright brothers the inventor of airplane?The authors stupidity showed up in the entire book. I don't know why they even bothered to write a book about a subject that they are totally ignorant."
2,A big disappointment,"I am intensely interested in Franklin D. Roosevelt and his times, so I figured this book on a little-explored aspect of his career couldn't miss. Colorful characters straight out of ""Guys and Dolls"" rub elbows with the patrician Roosevelt in this account of the transition between the free-wheeling era of Tammany Hall to the do-gooder era of the New Deal. Too bad that author Mitgang lacks any sense of story-telling ability. The organization of the book is sloppy and confusing and robs the story of any drama. The humorous aspects fall flat. Great idea for a book, but the execution is a misfire."
1,If you know anything this won't help,A skinny little book that is really only a collection of facts found in much better books. The author attempts to use a Von Daniken style in posing questions to the reader then darting off in a certain direction as though it were true. This book reminded me of the study notes I used to make at school - it appeared to be a collation of 'facts' that the 'author' culled out of other books and simply tabulated and collated. I beleive the term is 'research by exegesis'. As we say in Australia 'A pretty ordinary effort'.
5,Good introduction to cycling.,"This book is a good introduction to cycling. It will give good tips on how to set up your riding position, ride securely, differences between mountain biking and road biking, buying appropriate clothing, etc. I'm not a total newbie on MTB but i learned a lot with this book.I gave 5 stars to this book because as the title says, this is a book for the new cyclist, so if you are a more advanced rider, you can still find it useful but you should look out to something more specific."
4,EVERYONE needs a little help every now and then!,"VERY informative little book, I must say. While some of the instructions go a little ""over the top"", length-wise,(changing a flat tire), it is always feasible to be too""wordy"", than not""wordy"" enough. Basic maintenance is crucial to enjoying a bike, and to think nothing is going to happen to your bike while riding, is asking for trouble. This book should be standard reading for all bike enthusiasts....mountain AND road. It answers most of the beginning cyclist's questions with easy to read text. Even seasoned ""veterans"" will appreciate the full spectrum of subjects included in this paperback."
3,"solid book, maybe to expensive for what you get","This is good basic information that is covered in a number of other introductions to cycling. It is the kind of book that should be included free when you buy a new bike, like for years ""Play It Pro"" by San Sneed was given away when you bought a set of Wilson golf clubs. Is this book worth $8.00 with shipping? Not to me, there are a number of much better books in that price range, such as Cycling to 100. Great Book. Having said that, it is a solid little book that covers all the bases, you can have it read in an hour or two and give it to a friend."
4,Cyclist book,Good book for new cyclists. I would recommend for all new cyclist. To get to minimum number of words required.
4,New Cyclist Handbook,"New Cyclist Handbook is a good source for comprehensive information for anyone wanting to begin taking biking seriously, e.g., as alternative transpiration . It covers choices of bikes, safety, technique and work out for those who wish to ride for the joy of the exercise."
4,Good first timer book,This was a good book for the first time rider. I learned many things. I recommend this book to anyone that is a first time rider.
1,Doesn't Work!,"This product does not work as expected. I wanted to connect a mouse and a keyboard to the one PS/2 port on my ThinkPad notebook, but this adapter casues the computer to beep when both devices are connected."
1,Expiration date was way too early,"The price was right, but the expiration date was in just a few months! I believe that the company was just try to dump their old stock. This is fine if the buyer was informed of why the price was low."
1,Not Good!,"These fire alarms were installed in my condo when I bought it. At 3 am the alarms started going of 3 loud beeps at intermittent intervals. I unplugged them, replaced the batteries, then they wouldn't stop chirping - with brand new batteries. I called Kidde the next day. After a brief test, the guy determined that all 5 alarms were malfunctioning and needed to be replaced. All 5 fire alarms died in one night, really, what are the chances of that. He kindly told me they all need to be replaced. Oh and they were 6 months past their warranty. They will be replaced, but not with a Kidde brand!"
4,A valuable addition to my clamping needs!,"I bought these clamps for glass interior shutters I am making. 2.25"" oak frames surrounding hammered glass, 45 degree cuts (to be followed up with spline keys after the glue dries).This clamp made it easy to clamp the frames with the glass in place.The only reason I didn't give this clamp 5 stars, was because unless I was VERY careful when moving the clamped shutter from my work bench so I could address glue drips on the ""under side"", the corners had a tendancy to pop (slide) off. I attribute this to the plastic corners sliding on my poly'd frame. I figure I'll glue small (2mm thick) neoprene pads to the mating surface of the corners to eliminate the slipping issue.Overall, no problems with applying pressure and they worked as one would expect."
2,If some say its idiot proof then I'm an idiot,"I have tried to use this strap clamp on multiple projects and have not had any success. It's either I don't have 8 hands to hold everything and tighten it at the same time or it is beyond my knowledge base to operate. About the only thing it was good for was a miter cut box top or picture frame, something that can rest flat and that the plastic corners can lay on the bench top and tighten evenly. If its even a little off the plastic corners slip off the corner by rolling over the top or under the bottom. It's like the moon and stars all have to align before I can get it to work as intended. I would not purchase this product again.Pat"
5,"Easy to use, works great.",I used this clamp to build some frames for large speaker panels for a home theater room. It was very easy to use and did a great job.
5,Bessey VAS23,Clamp was easy to use and provided good clamping pressure. Might need a couple of extre hands on a large project.
5,Why did I wait so long to buy this?,"After fooling around for far too long with bar clamps, and many frustrating projects that were never QUITE right in the corners, I picked this up. The clouds parted, the sun shone, and I could not be more pleased with this. I primarily use this for small propjects...frames, boxes, etc. It is without a doubt the most valuable clamp I have in the shop. If you have been frustrated by sliding corners on your projects, look no further."
4,good but pricey,"i use the bessey VAS23 and the Wolfcraft one-hand clamps. i like the Wolfcraft better and they're about 2/3 the cost of the Bessey. That said, the bessey seems to be a bit better made, but the Wolfcraft one-hand feature is really handy when you're positioning the object steady with one hand and clamping with the other. I would reccommend either one."
4,Inovative tool,Plenty of power in the ratchet and ease of use make this tool my primary tool for repairing and assembling picture frames.
2,Bessey Vario Angle strap clamp,After getting this strap clamp I made 2 picture frames and it didn't work for either one. The only way this works is if you have a wide edge all the way around the picture frame. Mine did not and the strap would just slip off. I use molding to make my picture frames and the thin edge is on the out side. I wish I had not spent my monet on this and gotten a set of clamps that do one corner at a time.
1,Bessey sstrap clamp,"I have used several types of band clamps over the years. They all get the job done but the Bessey clamp does it faster and easier. A little pricy for the occasional user, but worth it if it you have a need often for a band clamp. You will probably want at least two.Joe Seidel"
5,Best band clamp ever,"If you have ever struggled with clamping frames or boxes together, you will love this clamp. The adjustable angle corner brackets are easy to place in the desired location and when pressure is applied, it is applied evenly on all the brackets. Speaking of pressure, this clamp can apply alot of it, I mean tight, without slipping at all. The wheel next to handle is ideal because it stores any extra band not in use. The band is made of what appears to be polyester, but it definately has my confidence that it will not tear or break. Of all my clamps in the shop, this is one of my favorites. It just plain works well and turns what used to be a hard job into and easy one."
3,Bessey VAS23 Vario Angle Strap Clamp Review,"While the strap has approx. 1100 lbs. of tensile strength, the crank mechanism is inadequate to produce much clamping force at all."
3,They are probably good if...,"...You are clamping something larger than a picture frame. I bought this clamp to hold the four corners of some 1x picture frames I made last summer.The clamp blocks are too large to hold the frame material flat and kept twisting the corners.If you were trying to clamp something bigger, like a chair or small table, the clamp would be great. It has great pressure and Bessey always makes great products."
4,Fun little camera for watersports.,"does not have the best resolution, but what do you expect for such little money.amazing that it can capture audio in the water as well.the camera does what they say it will.I do recommend using in full light situations, as it does require a nice sunny day for the best results.Jamie"
5,Kudos - GREAT CAMERA FOR THE PRICE,Great Camera for the price. I used on a whitewater rafting trip and it took great pics and videos. I did have a problem with the camera after loaning to another passenger on the trip. IF YOU WANT A COMPANY WITH GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE - THIS IS THE CAMERA TO BUY!!! The company went well beyond customer service to not only replace camera but also helped in retrieving my pics from a bad SD Card.
2,It's just OK,"The Hero 3 is a very basic camera solution for outdoor, active photography.Pros:-- It is small and easy to carry-- the wrist strap worked well and left the camera securely on my armCons:-- as mentioned in another review, the quality of photos from the Hero 3 is extremely suspect; any ""brightish"" background will reduce the foreground subject of your photo to an almost unrecognizable blob-- the lack of real-time feedback and the above mentioned picture quality issues leave you less than confident of what you will see when back in front of a computer or TVIf this was a $50 item I could imagine it would come across much better as a fun, ""I'll take what I get"" novelty camera. At $150 it's not a trustworthy enough device to be worth the investment."
5,Scuba Diving with the Hero,I tried the camera in a pool and I was disappointed with pictures. Then I tried putting it in video mode. On a scuba trip to Belize I only used video which lasts about 50 minutes just about the time for one dive. After a little practice I had no trouble just pointing my wrist at the subject and usually was right on. The breathing sound definitely adds realism. The color is OK but changes with the light. Even at 90 ft. the light is good and you still see color. No leaks. The video is jerky when viewed raw but I run it though Adobe Premiere and converted it to 30 frames per second and the result was amazing. I now have smooth realistic motion. Use it only in video mode; you can always take out single shots if you want to print one.
4,FRANK EN,This is one of the best of the strangest movies out there. You gotta see it! They don't make 'em like this anymore!
5,FrankenHooker,"If you have a sense of humor, love B grade movies, and have an affinity for sci fi \ horror...then this is for you!It's a lighthearted Reanimator that is shot like The Toxic Avenger or Class of Nuke 'em HighI don't want to spoil it for you but if you get a laugh out of ""outre"" material like those others then you will really enjoy Frankenhooker.You will never again hear the questions ""Got any Money?"" or ""Looking for some action?"" again without bursting out in laughter."
4,Jerzy boiz,"Admittedly, I LOVE cheesy, low budget films with little plot, acting or script. If I can see that a bunch of friends got together, drank beer - or what ever - and got it on film: thats all the criteria nessacary to hook my attention.Frankenhooker goes up and beyond every one of my basic points of interest. There is a script which is just simple and a lot of fun, when put in the right hands.If you and your friends enjoy sitting around watching movies, drinking beer and shouting at the television screen, while keeping pace with the film: Frankenhooker is just the ticket"
2,"Great trashy movie, but...","...wasn't this supposed to be UNRATED? The only version of this available on DVD on Region 1 is R-rated ... Granted, from what I understand, the difference is just a matter of a little more nudity. But still, aren't DVDs supposed to be more definitive than this? Not to mention the disappointing lack of any real extras on this disc. Oh well. There's supposedly an unrated PAL DVD out there, which is nice if you happen to have a PAL-compatible player. Maybe someday a DVD company that actually knows what it's doing will release this in its full uncut glory, with some extras to talk about."
4,REALLY WACKED! VERY ENTERTAINING BUT THIS IS NOT HENENLOTTER'S BEST WORK,"This is a really crazy flick! I am very familar with Frank Henenlotter's work and this is very good, but he has done better. Check out ""Brain Damage"" and the ""Basket Case"" trilogy. This guy is definitely ""out there""...but in a good way. If you have an open mind and like horror with a funny twist...this is for you!"
2,"There is ""camp"" and there is just plain boringly bad.","This one comes under the second heading. After reading all the great reviews I ordered FRANKENHOOKER. I wish I hadn't. We did the ""all sit down and have popcorn while enjoying a funny movie"" sort of thing and it was a total bust -- even though the popcorn was good.Let's ignore the fact the case the movie was in wasn't in very good shape. That isn't the fault of the film. My problem was, even thought I've been a fan of bad movies for years, they have to have some substance underneath the silliness. While there were a few ok moments, like when he was trying to find the right girls to bring home, for the most part we were all bored with it. I did like Louise Lasser as his mother.I saw where one reviewer referred to this film as ""side splitting and sexy"". Maybe it's just me, then. I really didn't see anything like that in this one. I guessing you have to be in the right mind-set to really get into FRANKENHOOKER -- and obviously we weren't."
2,wast of money,what a waste of money these guys are only 2 hit wonders.dont even bother reading the tracks
3,Hes lost hes consistancy,"I to like everyone think the rapping on this album is just down right terrible. Tracks such as Ride wit me have potential, but where does a Ant Banks beat of that calibre deserve the gayness of the guess whos back the player whos here to stay crap. Even my beloved Big Bad Ass puts down some lame beats on this album which was disappointing and surprising. Still cross me up, gameless mortals and stragglers come through with funky bass that is at least worth bumpin to. This album is only slightly better than lead the way and thats more due to it having a larger range of bangin tracks as apposed to better tracks. I think the lack of typical Ant Banks funk on hes 2 TWDY releases maybe the reason why they have done little else since. But what drugs was Banks on to allow some of the worst hooks Ive ever heard be used with hes beats. I suppose nobodies perfect"
1,horrible,"i thought this cd would be alot better. Even the beats suck. If you really like ""playa holiday"" buy a single."
4,"Weak lyrics brought this down, but Ant saved it a little","After listening to Ant's BIG THANGS and hearing PLAYERS HOLIDAY on the radio, I had high hopes for this album. Unfortunately, the wack lyrics a lot of these guys have dragged it down. The only thing that rescued it was Ant's production skills.CROSS ME UP, THE GAME, DRINKS ON ME, and PLAYERS HOLIDAY were the only decent songs on the album. I suppose PERVIN was okay, but the rest of the tracks were just hella weak. It's obvious why these MCs don't have their own albums...they ain't got no skills! They may have game, but their lyrical style is just limp. CJ Mac especially is annoying to listen to.If you can get this for a good price, then the four songs I mentioned definitely make it worth it. Otherwise, I can't really say that I'd recommend it."
5,Some good stuff,"Ant Banks and the dangerous crew ain't no 2-hit wonders. They've been layin down the tight beats for a long time and this ain't no exception. ""Cross Me Up"", ""Pervin"" and ""Drinks on Me"" are the sweetest tracks on the cd (you already knew ""Player's Holiday"" was tight). Buy it, and if you like it, buy ""Best of Ant Banks"""
3,How Free?,"The book focuses on women's work in an antebellum southern town. Excluding slave women, Lebsock seems to claim working women enjoyed a certain amount of freedom and independence. She also portrays the middle class as accepting married white women as wage earners as long as their jobs paid well or the money was needed. But I have doubt about some of the conclusions as the book does not take into consideration how women's wage work affected their roles in their families and her overall positive portrayal of women's lives at the time."
3,Steroids will kill you eventually,I wrote in an earlier review that I would be buying more of these as I could afford them. Well I haven't and I won't be. Forty bucks for a clamp is not all that bad but I'm not as happy with them as I once was. One of my clamps completely stopped working. We all have to put up with lemons from time to time. I understand that. I find these clamps annoying. None of my guys will even use them anymore. It is so easy to get yourself in a bind where they won't release for anything. You have to plan ahead when you clamp with these bad boys. You have to leave yourself plenty of play in the threads to be able to back the screw off before you tighten with the one handed lever. Sound complicated ? It beats destroying your work to get the blasted thing off ! I like the regular tradesman clamps better for many reasons.
2,"Overpriced, overdesigned","I love tools and that together with the look and feel of these and the fact that I spent so much should have guaranteed a positive review. Unfortunately, in actual use these are a pain. They are difficult to use one-handed. When adjusting you need to release with one hand while holding square to slide the other. When pumping them closed they don't really get that tight so you'll end out switching to the screw adjustment. I might forgive that but you also have to be careful to leave sufficient thread to release since unscrewing is the only release mechanism.So, save your $$ and get the Bessey tradesman clamps. Just slip it into position while putting it on, and twist it tight. You can get several Tradesmen for the price of one Powergrip."
1,Think twice before buying Probably you don't need this,I bought this warmer-cooler a year back and believe me I never used it except on one occasion when I plugged to test it.
1,Karloff's Sad Farewell,"One of Boris Karloff's last films, ""Dance of Death"" is a depressing experience. Those who ridicule Bela Lugosi for his Ed Wood collaborations should take a look at this shabby Mexican production. It's hard to believe, but Karloff sunk even lower than Lugosi when he agreed to appear in this exploitation trash."
2,"Great for little phones n such, not so much for laptops.","This little device works great for cell phone charges and the like. But I bought it to use my MacBook Pro while traveling in my car (my partner drives, i ride) and as soon as i plug it in, it goes out. The Mac Book Pro uses an 85 watt plug in so i thought a 90 watt continuos power adapter would be perfect... Not. I guess it can't handle it so it just checks out.If you only need it for smaller appliances on the go, than it is fine."
3,Not my favorite Williams' play,"It's an unusual story, but I don't find it nearly as moving as Streetcar or Night of the Iguana."
2,Unknown binding,"Loved the movie and wanted to read the book version. Was disappointed when I received the book and it was the ""play"" version. Buyer beware."
2,Adverage pot boiler story of adventure and drama on the sea,If you are looking for orginality and something differen't don't invest in this book. I found it to be highly predictable and much the same as many before it. This would not be so bad if it were 'good story telling' . Unfortunately it does not come close . So I am sorry but I must pass on this one. No surprises here. END
3,ok,I like Ani but sometimes it sounds like she is playing the same guitar riff through every song. I like how she sings about songs with meaning.
1,The worst Spot book yet!,"This book is not up to par with other Spot books. I would give Where Is Spot, Spot On The Farm, Spot Goes To The Farm, Spot Goes To The Beach, all 5 stars. But this one is different. There is no story to follow and the words make no sense. I wonder how this book could be so bad when there are so many acceptional Spot books out there? I can only assume Eric Hill was suffering from some horrible illness and was dilusional when he wrote this one. Steer clear of this book, but do look at other Spot books. My 9-Month-Old loves Where Is Spot the board book a lot!"
1,worst engineered product for boat covers,how could a reputable co. sell this crap...don't they have buyers who evaluate and care?I want my money back. I went to the local boating store and purchased fiberglas bows that work!rb clay
3,Do your own warm-up first,"This video is labeled ""intermediate"" level, and it is pretty challenging. One drawback is that it does not have a warm-up/stretch section, so you need to do that on your own first. The workout is 30 minutes long and covers torso, lower and upper body, and low impact aerobics."
2,Returned,I purchased this and was really excited about it. The product description didn't say the pages were spiral bound and inserted into the cover. So I returned it. Doesn't look like something that would last.
4,Reading and Remembering Why I'm an Armchair Traveler,"What a great opportunity to learn more about the Paris I love, and French food which I do not prepare at home. I wait for my trips. I am not intimidated with the snooty waiters, as I did my ""homework."" I'm prepared to ask questions about loaves and wine and anything else. The set-up of the chapters was easy reading, too. I trusted the writers. I discovered more secrets in Paris via their investigations and risky ventures. I didn't have to suffer the frustrations of getting lost on the metro nor the pains of tusseling with those Parisian cabbies. I especially enjoyed the trips to the new and modern Paris as described by Paul Goldberger. Do you want to loaf with a loaf, drink a bottle away from the bottlenecks? Read this book. Also, I will read other books in the Modern Library Food series based on my enjoyment of Ruth Reichl choices."
5,True Paris,"Just a terrific book recalling the ""dining"" history of Paris. Nice short varied chapters that will make a foodie's mouth water. I recommend it."
1,Caution: This was recorded in EP mode!,I just bought this tape and found that all 57 or so minutes of it are crammed onto a few feet of tape because it was duplicated in EP mode instead of SP. (We all know that most movies come in SP mode.) The quality suffers a lot.The video cassette in this case is mostly empty space. I really don't get it. Why ruin such a fun cartoon this way? Does that extra video tape really cost so much? Why why?
3,good so far,"great set, as advertised. ONLY downfall is that they are made in China. Got them as a gift. For the money great set, if I were to spend my own money I would of bought a S&K set for a couple $$$ more and support AMERICAN LABOR and the clean air act at the same time."
5,Grab and go...,"I can just grab the case and know I have all the sockets I will need - SAE or METRIC. Short or Long. If a hole is blank, I know one is missing. Granted the case is a bit big. But everything is there and has its place. May not be feasible at the daily workbench, but if you need to move around - home, then work, job site, then they are all there. Use with hand ratchet or impact. Unless I need a thin wall socket for clearance, I usually don't bother to grab my Snap-on's anymore. Have had these for about 2 years I think it is now. Case has held up well so far. Course, you don't want to throw it around, or the hinges may fail. So, the case is decent. Sockets are staying locked in their pockets just fine. Hope this is helpful..."
3,Victim,"Although the writing is excellent, I couldnt get pass Baca's reoccurring theme that he was in jail because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time and things just never went well for him. He blamed everything on other people and never took responsibility. He describes the police during a drug at his house by saying the cops just shot at them for no reason. He never expressed any remorse for an officer who was killed.I felt sorry for Baca during his pitiful childhood and it is amazing what he has endured to become a successful writer and poet but who wants to listen to a whiny victim for long?"
2,Take Some Responsibility,"This is a memoir of Jimmy's life before, during, and after spending five years in a maximum security prison. He led a very interesting life and for that the book is worth a read. It is hard to get past his attitude of blaming all his problems on everyone else. He takes no responsibility for his actions, even the troubles that landed him in jail. He clearly was involved in some serious stuff. He was dealing drugs and then he says that life is so unfair I didn't get to take all my drug money and start a new life. He continues to blame everyone, the guards, the legal system, the other inmates, his counselors, the warden. Stop whining!"
5,A Powerful Memoir,"I saw this book on the library shelf today and was reminded of the force it hit me with when reading it some years back. Not only is it a powerful story of survival and transformation but the writing just drips with sweat and emotion. I remember I gave my copy to a relative who isn't much of a reader. When I asked him later if he'd gotten a chance to read it he said a date he had over for dinner saw it on the table and began perusing its pages. She eventually couldn't put the book down and asked if she could borrow it. She would later praise him for his choice of literature. I don't think he ever told her that he hadn't read it, but he did begin reading it once she returned it with praises. The power of the written word and a pretty woman can transform a man.A Place to Stand is a towering story to climb onto!"
3,Mina's great...the DVD isn't.,"This is your basic Japanese profile video on model Mina Kawai. Mina is naturally attractive and has wonderful female features, so there are no problems with this DVD there. She is presented in several different settings in her natural form, so there is no body makeup to mark out any of her very few skin blemishes. However, all the profile scenes are in painfully slow motion and it seems to take forever to get from one scene to the next. This video gets 3 stars, not because of Mina, but because the DVD presentation could have been much, much better. There are no chapter divisions which makes the disk somewhat non-user friendly. Also be advised that all dialogue is in Japanese with no English subtitles."
5,Wee Will Wee Will ROCK YOU!!,"The long awaited debut full length from the Athens, GA based wee turtles is an all around excellent album. Some of the songs are recorded on an old fashioned 4-track, but the majority of them get the Hi-fi studio treatment they deserve. The songs themselves are catchy, yet complicated all at the same time. You will find yourself singing along, but also in awe at the time changes that so many of the songs feature. Sweet 60's-esque vocal harmonies abound, and with songs about super heroes, track and field and other such topics how can you go wrong?! If you like this check out the wee turtles evil twin brother: Je Suis France, or their over achieveing older brother: The Masters of the Hemisphere.."
2,ha ha...ha?,"I'm not sure what these guys were trying to do here. Their first CD was based on the gimmick that they were the worst band in the world, and for what it was worth, was very humorous (""House me Teenage Rave"" still cracks me up and ""Obey the Cowgod"" had a most excellent hook.) But with this CD, it seems like they were just way too full of themselves. There's just not a whole lot of laughs and quite a few of the songs are incomprehensible or just plain lame. (Super Elastic, Fight, Orange Krunch, Anthem, Jump). The only highlights are ""Carnage Rules"", ""Jerk"" and ""Fixation"". If they were going to do this album better, I'd say get over yourselves and put at least twice as many songs into it, to balance out the crap factor (like a certain grindcore band I might name, but can't because I'd be censored!)"
4,it is not what I expected,"the CD is great, I love this kind of music, but I bought this because of Carnage rules track, but it disappointed me because it is not like the version from SNES, they should have add it one last track, or bounus one, as ""carnage rules-no lyrics"" ..the force of the song is about music, no lyrics."
4,Good,"Fairly good album. I bought it because when I was younger I played Maximum Carnage and noticed that the music for that game was much better than the ordinary game music. Just one dissapointment. In the game we listen the Black Sabbath song 'The Mob Rules', however this CD doesn't have this song performed by Jelly. All in all, a good comical thrash album."
3,"Music is funny, but they run out of ideas quickly.","Green Jelly is a low-class, low-self esteem band--and they write their music on that. This CD was OK, but it got a little boring after a while. So what do you do when you're running out of ideas? Take an everyday thing and make a 3-minute song about it. More or less clean, unlike their ""Cereal Killer Album."" The best track is the first one. Based on Acclaim's ""Maximum Carnage"" Super NES video game. Well, no. Green Jelly wrote that for the game. Good game! (By the way, did you know they first started out as Green Jello? They said, that's ordinary. Let's be unique...Green Jelly? that's absurd. Let's use it!) All in all, 3 stars is all I give it."
1,About As Funny As The Title Suggests,"If you're gonna be a joke band you pretty much have to be funny. Green Jelly are just loud and dumb. It seems likely that with their `scary' growled vocals and puerile obsessions they will one day be considered the godfathers of the rap metal genre, this does not make them interesting to listen to. This particular album even lacks the dubious benefit of including the overplayed `Three Little Pigs"" which would seem to be the only reason to buy a GJ album. Best tracks are `The Bear Song' and `Slave Boy'."
2,Poor design,"This cover is great in that it covers all surfaces of the shopping cart, but the major flaw is in the belt. I did not feel as though my daughter was secure in it and not having it attached to the cover itself means that it is super easy to lose."
1,Do not waste money: TERRIBLE,"I purchased this product and will not advise anyone to purchase it. It ripped after the first wash and as a new Mom you will be washing it quite often. I sewed it and it riped even more in a different location and when I say ripped it is torn to shreds. I washed it in cold, delicate with Dreft detergent. It is a poorly made product, as least the one I received. Even the stiching is ripping out. I am very dissatisfied and would not advise anyone to waste money on it. I hate writing bad reviews but I don't want other Mother's being as dissapointed as I was in this product and wasting their money."
4,Nice product,"This is a nice little ditty. It gives us some peace of mind when shopping with our baby.When we don't have it with us, we wish that we did."
4,Very nicely designed,We bought the Babe Ease Shopper primarily for grocery carts and it works quite well. It is easy to arrange in the cart while holding the (squirming) baby.We were surprised by how well it also works in restaurant baby seats.The padding can be arranged to provide the baby additional support (for sitting upright) in such chairs.The only improvement wished for would be for the strap (which ties the rolled-up pad for storage) to be sewed onto the pad in an appropriate orientation. It comes separate from the pad and is easily separated/lost.
5,I get so many compliments!,"Wonderful product - very well made, stain resistant and beautiful. I get stopped at least several times at each shopping trip asking where I purchased it. Highly recommended."
4,Excellent cover!,"This shopping cart cover is very cute (pink gingham) - it's very low key and not one of those way too brightly colored covers. My daughter seems to love sitting on it and it is well made and appears to be comfortable as it is very soft. I really just wanted something to cover all the possible parts in the seat of the shopping cart she could touch or put her mouth on and this does the job.As others have pointed out, it does fit better in some carts than others. It seems to fit perfect in Target's shopping cart, but is a bit big for other store's shopping carts. It's fine though because it has the velcro that you can somewhat adjust to get a better fit.I would definitely recommend this product! Excellent price, excellent product!"
1,Horrible product,This Clean Shopper is a horrible product. Not worth the money at all. I bought this thinking it would be a great way for me to keep my child safe from germs & comfortable while shopping. I was WRONG. It does not cover as well as it advertises & the material is so thin that that the bars are still poking through making it uncomfortable for my child to sit in.Definitely do some researching before even considering this product.
4,Great Invention,"I purchased this item for my granddaughter....it is great. Not only do we use it in shopping cards, but in high chairs in all the restaurants.I highly recommend to all those you have babies.Thanks Again!"
2,bad design,"I agree with another reviewer, whose information I read only after I'd purchased the clean shopper. It is impossible to keep track of an unattached strap. I returned this product as soon as I saw the strap, which you need to attach your child to the cart, is separate from the cover. This was not specified in the description. Also, it just bothered me that the printed material...the cute jungle animals that are supposed to stimulate your child, not you, for heaven's sake, are printed upside down to their eye. Sorry, but I have enough to look at when I'm grocery shopping. I am very disappointed that I still do not have a cart cover for my child. The clean shopper was at least reasonably priced. All of the other cart covers I've seen which are large enough to cover the whole cart, and are well designed, start at $60."
4,works fine,It does the job fine and the fabric is a fun design that helps entertain your baby. The strap is good in that you can thread it through the back of the seat in the shopping cart thereby securing the seat cover to the shopping cart as it were. Otherwise there's nothing to anchor it to. And easy to put on even with holding baby in one arm.
4,Keeps baby clean,"My 7 months old daughter likes to put her mouth on EVERYTHING, so having this shopping cart cover prevented her from putting her mouth on the dirty, germ infested cart. Other shoppers see my baby and think the idea is cute!"
5,Great Product!!,"Great product and good idea, my son is almost 3 and I am still using it. Carts are so germy and with all the viruses floating around it's good to have along with some anti-bacterial wipes. Great Product."
4,Excellent product!! Only one downfall:(,"I absolutely love this item, my one year old attacks the shopping carts at every which angle so I snagged this item as fast as possible and every since he doesnt even want to chew on the cart as much:) And even if he does its not the germ infested cart its the cart cover. The only thing I could complain about is that it doesnt have like an adjuster feature and it is too big for a lot of the carts at stores like big lots, or even walmart, which gives the baby slack to pull it back and put his mouth on uncovered cart:( But over all it is an excellent product and highly reccommend this for any mother who has a child who loves to put every thing in their mouth including shopping carts;)"
1,The BUGGY BAGG Is WAYYYYYYYY Better,"I agree with the other posts that say the Clean Shopper is a terrible product. It is awefuly uncomfortable for baby to sit in. There is no cushioning at all.We received this as a gift when our daughter was born. But at the same time, we also received the Buggy Bagg from my husband's parents. The Buggy Bagg is wayyyyyyyyyy better. It is a shopping cart cover, high chair cover, diaper bag & changing pad all in one. It has very thick padding, matching pillow, toy loops, bottle holders, zippered compartments & folds into itself creating a bag with handles. I LOVE MY BUGGY BAGG.We took back this aweful Clean Shopper. I would hate using it for my child. Take my advice & buy the Buggy Bagg."
3,not quite,"The cover only covers where the child sits. The child can easily pull up the cover on the sides and touch the cart underneath. Also, the child's legs are not protected from the cart. I will probably make modifications to it and use it again, but I would not recommend buying it."
3,Great with a couple minor flaws,"My baby liked this cart cover right away. Brightly colored and comfy, he never whined once during an hour long shopping trip. However, I'm only giving a 3 star because the loops for attaching toys broke within 5-minutes and I cut myself pretty well on the manufacturer's packaging (those plastic corners are SUPER sharp)."
5,I don't leave home without it!,"I started using this when my daughter was 10 months old and now she's 14 months old. I don't spend alot of time making sure all the velcro is attached and I never use the seat belt since my daughter is not a wiggler and I never leave her unattended. I love the 2 little tabs where toys can clip on. I have 2 special toys that I only let her play with while we're shopping, so she'll fiddle with them during the whole shopping trip. Almost every trip she'll lean over to put her mouth on the cart, but she has to chew on the cart cover instead! I've washed this several times and its still in great condition."
3,Great Price Very Practical,"Easy to carry around place and clean. I use it when we go shopping for groceries or even when dining at restaurants. Any statains, just throw it in the washer and good as new. I bought the blue zoo one even tho I have a little girl. Doesn't make a difference. The only thing I would have done different is that I would have chosen one that maybe has a little toy or something attached to use as a distraction. But hey for less than $20 I cant complain!!"
4,good product,"works well in most shopping carts, however, doesn't work very well in restaurant high chairs."
1,Buy something else,"My biggest complaint about this is that the velcro pieces are useless. The placement of them doesn't help at all in many types of carts, and my 17-month old son spends most of his time pulling the fabric back from the cart and touching every surface he can reach. It's not a ""Clean Shopper"" for me. I'm not paranoid about germs, but shopping carts are pretty disgusting...I'd prefer to have a cover that stays put when I attach it. And the strap it comes with is a joke."
2,What are we looking for here? Taste? Nutrition? Portability?,"First of all, let me say that Odwalla makes absolutely the best bottled juices on the market. Original flavors, always fresh, and wonderful to pour down on a hot busy day.So I tried these bars in good faith. I love strawberry. I love pom. I love the idea of berries and antioxidents and all that healthy stuff. And they are portable. And they are good for me -- I know this.But the taste and the texture are really disappointing. Like a thick paste. Sort of an artificial strawberry taste -- even though I just KNOW Odwalla would never use a fake strawberry flavor. And did I say gooey and like a paste? No crunch.Ah well. Back to the juice."
1,Poor Boris!,"In retrospect, it's a good thing Boris Karloff didn't live to see this trashy horror flick. The ailing, 80-year-old actor was glad to be working, but he could have selected a better project than ""The Snake People."" Judging by his limited footage, Karloff probably didn't know (or care) what kind of schlock he was making. Sadly, this is exploitation filmmaking of the worst kind. For Karloff completists only."
4,Unintentionally hilarious!,"OK, ""Snake People"" doesn't make any sense at all, but aside from the plot, there some great voodoo scenes and the erotic dancing kept my eyes firmly glued to the screen. (I think the scruffy white guy who resurrects a zombie to be his girlfriend is the overseer of Karloff's plantation). Anyway, forget trying to figure out the plot and just enjoy this high octane romp."
1,Faulty On/off Button,"Received as a gift, out of the box appeared ok.Attempted to use it and the on/off button was sticking and would not depress. Attempted to use for a couple of days, then the button would not depress at all. Sent back and chose a different product.Also noticed that it has no decent memory of last work out and if you accidentally press the button again, your previous information is erased."
1,Doesn't work,"The watch and wrist strap worked right out of the box. The second time I wore it I began have issues of it not reading the heart rate. By the third time I wore it, I couldn't even get a momentary reading. I replaced the battery on the chest strap....still nothing. Junk as far as I'm concerned."
2,Embarrassing gift,"I gave this as a Christmas gift to a friend who had just taken up running. It worked twice (and she was pretty pumped about it), and then died. The culprit? The battery in the chest band was dead. The user can buy a battery for the band and replace it, but I know she spent a fair amount of time on the phone with Timex trying to get a new band or battery without having to spend money herself on this instantly faulty product. Timex was not helpful after the first hours on the phone. I do not know if Timex ultimately stood behind its product cause she has stopped talking to me about it. Beware."
2,Wouldn't buy this again....,"The main problem with this heart rate monitor is that it takes a long time to start, usually at least 10 minutes into a workout. I would not recommend it."
3,Timex monitor purchased from Amazon.com,"We had a very hard time to get the monitor to start to work and each time we use it we had to fiddle with its positioning to get the monitor to record the heart rate. Since we did not want to spend a lot of money on a monitor, this seemed the perfect choice. I did expect it to be easier to operate but time will tell on its function."
2,IT DOESNT WORK CONSISTENTLY,"This watch will work well for a while and then start giving you bad readings. Like 50bph in the middle of a spinning class, and the 145bph and the 25bph.... I've tried many things to get it to work properly, (changing position of the band, etc) but it works when it wants. I believe the problem is the band, not the watch itself...Spend more money and get somrthing that actually works well for more than 1 week."
1,Didn't work,"The Time/Set button didn't work on this and finally broke off. Although others seem to have had better luck with this HRM, the one I got was a lemon. I'm thinking it's necessary to spend some more money."
4,timex HR monitor,"Product works well and as advertised. Larger numbers and Indiglo feature are handy for low light runs/ spin classes. No problems with it so far - I changed over from an Omron HR monitor because the Omron kept having battery problems. Happy with the performance of this one so far.Pobably not adequate for Bi or Tri-athalon training but fine for the basics, which is all I use it for. 4 out of 5 stars because the connectors to the chest strap are a little unusual and take a bit longer to snap and un-snap then most other types I've used or seen.Would purchase again."
5,Good Deal,"For the price I paid, I actually expected a lot less than I received. I use a lot to exercise and again expected so much less. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a heart rate monitor."
4,Simple to use and inexpensive,"This HRM has a strong signal and it's easy to use. It's also priced very well. It doesn't calculate your calories, but it does keep track of your last workout, including time, average heartbeat, and highest heartbeat. It also has an ""indigo"" light button that allows you to see the display in darkened rooms.The chest band is comfortable and adjustable. The wrist piece is a bit large for a woman, but I only wear it during workouts. It is also a watch but not a very attractive one.I used to have Polar but the battery ran down and I never got around to sending it in for a replacement. The Timex battery can be replaced by the owner, a big advantage.All-in-all, a good value and does what I want well. If you're a woman and want a more attractive watch, you'll have to pay more."
2,Doesn't feature a out of the zone alert.,This maybe a good little heart rate monitor but I'm sending it back ASAP b/c I mistakenly thought it had the beeping feature to alert u while u were working out if u leave your preprogrammed heart rate zone. It doesn't. I hope u don't make the same mistake I did. So now it's back to the drawing board 4 me I guess.
3,No Max/Min notifications,"This is great for basically checking your heart rate at any given time. However it does not have a beep/notification of when you are outside your max/min heart range zones, and you can't set those either. It doesn't claim to do so but I had thought that was standard on them all. Also it has a beep from the chest band that goes to your heart beat. It might be annoying if your hiking/running with other people and they hear it too. If you're looking for a good monitor that has notifications of the heart rate zone, I would go with the similar model Timex T5G971."
1,garbage not water proof,WARNING THIS PRODUCT CLAIMS TO BE WATER PRROF BUT IT IS NOT i took a shower with this thing on after a workout and it had condensation inside the face of the watch and hasn't worked sense BUYER BEWARE
4,Excellent Monitor,I have been using the heart rate monitor at my local Planet Fitness and seems to be working great. Picks up my heart rate on all their equipment without any trouble at all. The chest band is comfortable once properly adjusted. This monitor should last a long time as you can just install a new battery when the old one dies. The watch band is plastic and comfortable on the wrist. If your looking for a plain old heart rate monitor to make sure your in the zone then Timex is your answer. I would buy another one if this one went bad.
4,The best bang for the buck!,The price is right. The quality is decent Timex quality. You could pay twice as much for about the same quality. Hint:New Balance. I am really please with this monitor. And if it fails I will get another one.
4,Chest strap,You are required to wear a strap around your torso. I didn't realize that until I tried to use the item. Works great.
2,Very poor quality.,"I've been through many heart rate monitors since I started using them 10 years ago. I am a competitive triathlete and runner, but I use HR monitors chiefly for when I'm indoors on machines rather than outside. Until now, I've always used Polar, but the price of this watch made me want to give it a try. What a mistake. The signal is continuously interrupted during a workout or, what is more typical doesn't show a reading at all. Don't waste your money on this."
3,Heart Monitor,"This is a good, accurate heart rate monitor. However, if I had it to do all over again I would have looked into options that do not require a chest strap."
5,wife loves it,bought it for my wife as a gift. she loves it. she wears it for every workout... ....... ...... ........
1,"Worked for a week or so, then useless.","I actually hate to write negative reviews, but this one is warranted. The belt and wrist monitor seemed to work great for about two weeks, then the heart rate indicated on the wrist monitor became nonsensical in relation to the activity, i.e., I'm rowing like a mad man for 25 minutes and I have a heart rate of 36 ??? I think I will get new batteries for both belt and monitor -- even though I've had them for about 45 days -- and see if that solves the problem. I'll follow up on this after I do that. I hate to get burned on purchases like this."
1,Worthless,Does not work in a WiFi laden environment. Could not link the monitor to the watch even outside. I am returning it.
5,Works Great!!,Have been using this for over a month....use it about 3 days a week. Since I'm doing an extreme home workout this was needed...glad I picked it up. No issues at all. Chest strap is very comfortable as well as the watch on wrist. Well worth the amount paid! I highly recommend this product!
2,You get what you pay for,"This was my 1st heart rate monitor that used for my cycle training. I wanted to start with something inexpensive so I can determine how effective these are for training. The item worked well for about 5 mos then it started to give false (low bpm) readings. I replaced the batteries, but it did not solve the problem. I just think its a very poor quality and hence the low price. The inability to download is also a negative on this product. My suggestions is to pay a little more and go with a more reputable brand in this category."
1,"Strap works, watch doesn't","The strap never synced with the watch. Going to the gym, the treadmill picked up on my heartbeat without a problem.Changed the batteries in both the watch and strap, thinking it was perhaps too weak to register on the watch. Still didn't work.Returned this one and Amazon is sending the replacement. Hopefully the next one works."
1,it did not work,"I don't know if some are just ""hinky"" but the one I got did not work well. It only picked up my heart rate if I pressed on it and shook it. The one my trainer has picks it up instantly so it's not that my heart isn't beating. Just a iffy product."
4,Satisfied - My first HRM purchase,"I read many reviews on various low to high priced HRMs and settled on this one, not wanting to invest a whole lot since I'm inexperienced with using them. I'm happy with this HRM. It seems to work just fine and is not complicated to use. It does what I expected it to do. It saves info for one workout - avg heart rate, time of workout, and max heart rate. I then use an online calculator and enter my HRM information to get my calories burned (super easy). There are higher priced HRMs that will do this and more, but if you are a novice, this one does the job. The only downside is that the wristwatch piece is big, but it seems most HRMs are. Smaller styles are few and far between."
1,Junk,"This product does not work. Tried numerous times by wetting the monitor strap with water, gels and sweat. A few time it would show a heart rate of 30 bpm."
1,FAIL,"I bought this product in March, and it worked just fine. Now as of June the watch part seemed to work, but the band didn't appear to be sending a heart-rate signal to the watch. I replaced the battery but it still won't work."
3,Entry level HRM,This is a very basic HRMPros1. Simple to use2. Works out of the box3. user changeable batteries4. INdiglo ---- to check reading in the dark5. Has a stop watchCons1. Stop watch starts as soon as you turn on HRM2. You cannot use teh watch as a stop watch w/o the strap around your chest.3. No split timing.
2,Works Inconsistently,"I had this HRM for about 2 months and it worked fine for during that time period. This is a low end HRM without a lot of features but it was all I really needed.Recently, it has started to quit working during some workouts. During some runs when my heart rate is high (above 175) it just quits. Other days it seems to work fine. It is very annoying when it quits in the middle of a workout so you lose your time as well as the heart rate information. If it keeps acting up, I will probably return it to Timex. They charge a $7.00 postage and handling fee to return it."
4,Timex T5G941 Heart Rate Monitor Watch Review,"This is my second Timex HRM. Both performed well. This model is a very basic unit, but it's adequate for my needs. I use it as a simple training aid, while riding my bikes. The chest strap is comfortable, and easily adjustable. It's accurate, has large numbers that are easy to read and it continues to work after surviving rides in hard rain. A plus is that the batteries are owner replaceable. For the price, you can't go wrong. If you need a model that shows heart rate zones, or other functions, look for a more advanced model."
3,Nothing Fancy,"If you want a basic heart rate monitor for a low price this is the unit for you. Simple and easy to use, will record average heart rate as well as Max rate during your workout."
4,Works very well,This monitor works very well and is comfortable to wear/use. I especially like it because it works with the walker machine I use. I sometimes have a problem getting it turned on; the button sticks every now and then. I would purchase this monitor again.
4,Good product.,Great product on picking up heart rate. Simple and easy to use. The treadmill also picks up the heart rate well but sometimes it interferes with the strap while im running.
4,It measures your heart rate.,"A number of people have complained about it not working without some type of gel, but my wife and I have not had that problem. If you wet the strap before you put it on, it works fine. If my wife and I are both wearing them near each other they interfere with each other, i.e. she gets my heart rate."
5,Hubby happy,"I got this for my husband for Xmas. He requested one and after reading the reviews online, I chose this one. He says it works great and he likes it, but he has only used it once. He said it was confortable."
3,Basic functions and a real flaw,"I was looking for a basic heart monitor/stopwatch, having never had one before. Once I got the hang of the chest strap and transmitter, things generally go as expected - you get elapsed time, average heart rate and max heart rate. I didn't need more. The one real kicker is that the button below the display turns the record function on and off AND tells it to display the previous workout. Picture coming in from a hard workout, stopping the recorder, and then hitting the button to display the info but not holding it down quite long enough. It starts recording a new session, wiping out your old (just completed) workout. It has happened more than once. Maybe you are better coordinated than I am, but be careful."
2,Stopped working after a year.,"This thing worked perfectly for the first year. It's the only heart rate monitor I've ever had that would work while biking into a wind (I'm sure those who have used heart rate monitors are familiar with this phenomenon). Now, after several battery changes in the watch and the chest strap, the monitor is apparently not receiving the signal. The watch works fine as a watch, but not as a monitor.Also, you're advised by Timex to send the watch back to the factory to have the battery replaced. So, you'd better be prepared to be without a heart rate monitor for a couple of weeks in order to do this. What I did was replace the battery myself which entailed shorting out the battery within it's cradle (no bid deal).I'd give it 5 stars if the thing was still working."
5,Love this for regulating the treadmill,"This works great at the YMCA. After having heart trouble, I insert a USB stick into the treadmill, set my max/steady heart-rate and the incline of the TM will automatically raise and lower to maintain it. Then I can just focus on ""NOT QUITTING"" and get my workout done. Really love it."
5,Heart Rate Monitor,"I love this monitor. It is a little slow to start, be sure to wet the strap first. Once you start your warm up it gets going. My favorite fitness tool! I won't exercise without it. It's a great purchase for the price."
4,Great product,I bought this looking for a heart rate monitor that would work during running. This does and very well.Had some issues figuring out how to keep the chest piece from slipping. The solution was to tighten the strap just a bit to make it more snug.CON: The watch does not come with a many common watch features such as a stop watch / count down feature.Overall great product
2,Activity Timer Problem,"There is a problem that the activity timer sometimes malfunctions, especially if the time/set button is pressed during a workout to review the current time of day. Sometimes the readings of average heart rate and peak heart rate are also affected."
3,"Easy to use, limited capabilities","Comfortable and easy to use. However, it is limited in that it only records one workout at a time, and overwrites any previous workout data with the most recent. This would be fine except for the fact that, the first time I used it, it quit halfway through the workout and began again. Because the data from the second half of my workout overwrote the data from the first half of my workout, I had no way of retrieving data from the first half of that workout. So, I may opt for a more expensive model that has a better data recording method and/or that I can trust not to restart."
4,Good for price,This is a great grab. With purchase one receives an arm watch and chest band. I have used it several times with no issue. I would recommend this product for anyone who is seeking an expensive workout equipment.
5,"GREAT PRICE, WORKS GREAT","I was hesitant to buy this but am so glad I did. It works better than I expected for the price, the chest band stays in place and is not at all uncomfortable under my sport bra as I had feared. I don't even notice it."
4,Heart Rate Monitor,"The monitor was bought because the battery on my old transmitter had run down. I was pleasently surprised to see that the new transmitter had a replacable battery. The receiver is not used much, but just gives current and average HR."
5,Timec t5G941 Heart Monitor,"FYI, Very Pleased with this Heart Rate Monitor !!! Works great !!! Very Glad I read the Reviews on the Timex, I work out with it on and Golf for4 to 5 hours at a time and hardly feel the chest strap. Very easy to use and read Plus I don't need the watch while working out on any machines with a heart rate monitor.Great Product. Glad I bought itJohn C"
1,Buy a Pulsar,Hard to use strap and then monitor was wildly inaccurate. Had two previous Timex's that lasted about 6 months each or less. Returned to Amazon for refund. Upgraded to a Pulsar for $99.00 and it works great. No use spending less on something that doesn't work!
3,"Worked well for first year, now takes a while to start","Got the monitor about a year and half back. Now that I'm through 2 batteries of usage, I'm finding that it takes about 15 minutes before it starts registering my pulse, or requires some extra moisture being added to it before it will start working. Otherwise, works great with most exercise machines at the gym."
1,zero stars,"The only good thing is the large numeral display. Easy for me to read on the go. But the stop watch works only when the heart rate monitor is picking up a heart beat which is very unstable, inaccurate, and intermittent . no lap function, no memory, no seconds on watch or even on the stop watch over one hour. All data is erased when stop watch/hrm is started. I want my money back."
1,Singing in the Shower!,I am not pleased with this product at all. You need to be soaking wet for the transmitter to work and then you still need to move it around on your chest to get a reading. If you were having sex in the shower it might work well! I do not recommend this product!
2,"works inconsistently after 4 months use - April 11, 2009","D. Baker's experience on April 1, 2008 mirrors my own. After maintaining 115 to 120 heart rate on the treadmill it drops to 50 and then to 35. I checked manually and that low count was wrong. Now it goes back for a refund I hope. I don't have the original packaging unfortunately."
4,I'm satisified,"The watch does what I wanted it to do and the watch band is nice and flexible. I was not thrilled with the band I have to wear around my chest, but that is my own fault, I didn't look close enough before I purchased it. I thought I would just have to wear the watch."
2,Doesn't do much,The band takes quite a bit of adjusting on my body to get it to register. I also have to hold the watch close to the band to make it register. I wish it counted calories. If it does it is to hard to figure out.The one thing that I do like about this product is that it wirelessly links up with most of the cardio machines at the gym. I can not get an accurate reading on the machines when I hold the handles. This product links up with the machine and displays my heart rate constantly.I do not think it was worth the money.
3,Erratic,"I have a hard time getting this thing to pickup my heartbeat. I wet it ...strap it on.....nothing...... So I start running..10 minutes into the jog I notice it FINALLY starts detecting a heartbeat, despite several adjustments on my chest. When it gets going..its GREAT!!!"
2,Battery Issues,"I only got to use it 2-3 times before the battery died. Until then, it was great, but now it is just taking up space on my shelf since I don't have time to take it in to get repaired."
1,Not much use,"Does not have that much use of this product, and not function well. I use it for swimming and for the gym and doesn't match or keep up with my HR."
3,Good Basic HRM,"This is a good `basic' HRM... while it lasts. I say that because mine only lasted two months before the wrist monitor broke and needed to be sent back to the factory for repairs. The wrist monitor is rated to be water resistant to 30 meters and to withstand pressure to 60 p.s.i., but it states in the manual it `does not need to be rinsed'. If Timex claims it can withstand 60 p.s.i., but water gently flowing from the tap causes it to malfunction, then they need to reevaluate their claims.I still like the Timex line of HRM's because the batteries in the chest strap can be user replaced. All of the others I have looked at require you to send it in to have them replaced.Just be aware... quality is directly related to the price paid."
1,Cheap,"Would not recommend this product. When i took it out of the package it felt cheap in my hands.The on/off button only worked 1/4 of the time. Would have to press it over and over again to get it to work. The heart rate monitor never pick up my heart rate. Overall, just a cheaply made product."
3,Battery Dead,"I had to spend an extra $8.62 to purchase batteries as the one in the sensor that came with it was dead. Once I replaced the battery, it seemed to work fine. I only received yesterday, but it seems okay so far."
3,HAS ONLY HOUR AND MINUTES...NO SECONDS!!!,"Beware that this watch, while a fine watch, does not have seconds. And, as previously mentioned in another review, you can't even activate the timer unless you are using the HRM. Since I ordered a watch specifically due to a need to time pulse rates (in addition to using the HRM), the watch is half useless to me. It would have been nice if this information had been in the description or the specifications. I'd never heard of a watch without seconds!It's fine as a HRM and not overly huge, which is nice."
4,Timex T5G941,"Just a side note: This is my first heart monitor and I have not compared the numbers with gym heart beat monitors.For the money the T5G941 is an excellent entry level heart monitor, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its problems. The start/stop button gets stuck and is hard to press. This has caused me to loss my workout stats multiple times. To get these stats you have to hold down down the start stop button after you have stopped a session. If you don't hold down the button long enough it will start a new session and cause you to loss all the information on the previous session. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."
4,Great beginner heart rate monitor watch,"This is a good basic heart rate monitor watch.It works perfect while you are running and your arms are close the the chest band. Once walking if you don't raise your wrist it dosen't work as well.I haven't changed the batteries yet but they are supposed to be easy to change, both the watch and the chest band take the same size battery and that is important because the chest band is a transmitter and should go through a battery every 24hrs of use. I run for about 30 min so the battery on the chest band should last for about 48 runs.My next heart rate monitor watch will cost about x10 times as much as it will have GPS and will give me my speed, distance as well as my heart rate. I'm in the Army must run 2 miles in specific time, and to me running on a track is boring."
5,"Great price, great product... would recommend!","I think this is a great product and well built. It doesn't have a lot of confusing features and it is very simple to use. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to monitor their heart rate while working out. It is a great price... much better than others which cost up to $200. I would never pay that much, in fact my last watch went out and I bought this one to replace it at a cheaper price and it has much better accuracy due to the chest band.The chest band is not bad, you will forget it is there after the first mile. A few times out, you will not even notice it."
5,A Great Heart Rate Monitor,"I just needed a basic HRM to make sure my workouts were in ""the fat burning zone"". And, this one works great. It is simple and easy to use and is a great price too!"
1,Poor reception ...,"Bought this watch to replace a Timex monitor I had for about 3 years. I was very disappointed ... it would not keep track of my heart rate for more than about 3 minutes at a time, very frustrating."
2,Not for swimming,"I did not read the product description which states (ambiguously) that the product is water resistant to 30m so can withstand splashes but is not for swimming.I just read the water resistant to 30m"".........I was very satisfied with the product in spinning and running situations, but then went swimming.After 200m the watch just packed in. I have not been able to use it since.If you aren't planning on using it in water, buy it."
5,T5G941 Heart Monitor Watch,"I use the monitor several times a week to check my exercising heart rate. The apparatus is easy to put on and easy to operate. The numbers are large enough to see while moving. The ""averages"" function helps track the changes over time."
2,Disappointed 2 ways,"1. It worked well for a few months, but recently it started giving bad readings. When I start on a ride it gives good readings, but after 15 or 20 minutes they suddenly drop to implausible levels -- e.g., 54 when I'm climbing instead of a normal rate of ~135. Sometimes it wakes up and reads sensibly but sometimes it stays in its weird mode for the rest of the ride. It's no longer usable.2. Although the monitor battery is easy to replace, I had to pay a watchmaker $25 to put a new battery in the watch (don't even try to do it yourself)."
2,Had to send watch in for repairs,I recieved the watch and found that I could not easily set the time nor activate the start / stop for heart monitoring. I did send it in for repairs and received it back in about a week. Works fine now. Just a pain to buy something only to have it sent in for repairs.Where is the quality assurance?
5,Great Simple Device,"I always hesitated on heart rate monitors because of comfort but I recently bought some cycling DVDs that recommended a heart rate monitor for the training sessions so I looked at monitors based on price. I just finished my first bike ride with it and found it very easy to use, not at all uncomfortable, and very accurate as I confirmed the readings several times taking my own pulse. All I was looking for was a basic heart rate monitor that would give me current, average and peak heart rates and this is exactly that - it is a perfect entry-level heart rate monitor that won't set you back some serious change."
3,Works just as it say. The watch band doesn't fit well though.,Not many features so don't expect to much. I never use the back light cause I never have a need for it.
3,Monitor Watch,Excellent except for the price. Now we can get the polar (better than this) for just $85. I doesn`t show different excersise zones and not summarized the final count as polar does.
2,Not a Good Monitor,"Bought this in February and have been disappointed with it from the get go. Makes a great watch but not worth a nickel as monitor. I would not recommend it to anyone. Also, when the monitor is working it gives false readings. Mine shows between 30-50 most of the time. When my pulse is actually taken it's usually around 60-65 at rest. At present it is on my left arm and showing 33. On my right arm is a blood pressure monitor and it is showing a 65 hbr. So, even if you can get it to work you're not guaranteed of the accuracy. What good is it then?"
1,Hit or miss!,"Virtually useless as a stopwatch/timer or a heart rate monitor. Stop watch feature does not work independently of the heart rate monitor. If the unit doesn't read your heart rate it turns itself off. So, you have neither your heart rate nor a measure of how long you have been working out. You ""wet"" the chest strap before you put it on. If you take too long to start exercising and sweating the chest strap will dry out and won't register your heart rate. If you wet the strap and start exercising immediately you have a chance that the unit will work properly. I tried to make it work. It's just too hard. It shouldn't have to be so hard!"
3,Good for starters,I bought this to keep track of my heart rate while cycling. It didn't disappoint at first however it's pretty annoying to check the time by pressing a button because it's not always visible and secondly the fast release tab on the strap monitor broke withing a couple uses. I'm not one to abuse my items and with moderate use this happen. So if you're serious about training I would suggest putting in the extra and buy a better model
1,Does't work,"I have used a few different monitors over the years, mostly Polar. I was just looking for a basic monitor and thought I would give this a try. Problem is that it doesn't work. I even changed batteries on the transmitter in hoping that it was just a quality control problem. It's been moistened, massaged and rebooted. It will work periodically but the watch registers about half the heart rate that the exercise equipment monitor will register. Pretty worthless."
4,Inexpensive & good quality,"I have two other heart rate monitors I can compare it with, Omron-100 and Omron-300.This one is a bare bones heart rate monitor which is great for someone who wants big display without all the fancy features. Its accurate and economical.My favorite is the Omron-300 since it has several thoughtful features like."
5,Awesome,I love this thing. I was looking at stores and couldn't find one cheaper than 150$ thankfully came here and got this one. The strap around your chest is pretty comfy and the watch is sporty. At the gym it syncs up with all the machines I use. Great investment. Does everything i expected it to.
5,LOVE IT!,"Love this. Super easy to use. Love tracking my heart rate. My hubby has a fancy schmancy garmin gps watch that has a heart rate monitor on it, and he gets very frusterated that it doesn't work all the time. I've had no issues with this one not working. Love it."
2,"Great for a few months, but...","This was $30 in Jan '09. I bought it to track my HR during the P90X program. It worked great for a few months giving me the basic features I needed; time, avg HR and Peak HR. I took a few months off of P90X and used it only a few times over the next few months. I recently started the P90X program again and a couple weeks into the program with daily use, the transmitter just stopped working. I replaced the battery, but still nothing. Fortunately I bought a 1 year warranty, so I was able to get a full refund. I will not buy this product or brand again. I hope this helps."
1,Can't get any reading,"Could not get this one to work. Tried to replace batteries, but it didn't do anything. I'll be returning it to amazon, because it seems cheaper than dealing with timex's warranty."
2,It misreads when you are on aero bars of your bike,I am preparing for a triathlon and when I bike (no matter what I do) starts underestimating the heart rate 30-40 bpm while I am mostly doing 135+. It's been more than a year. For running and other sports it works fine.
1,"One use, and toast.","Received the item, well packed, and shipped quickly, in perfect shape. Threw it on to test it immediately, worked fine. Took it off, and on the next trip to the gym, no HR readout would come up. Went to the gym frustrated, picked up some batteries on the way home since there's no way to tell if the batteries in the transmitter are good or bad. Swapped the batteries in the monitor and the strap for good measure. Still no heartrate, so back to Amazon it goes and trying the Polar brand this time around."
1,Will not last!,"This item was purchased less than two months ago and it no longer works. I have changed the batteries but it just keeps searching for my heart rate and then goes back to the clock. I thought it was a good price, but unfortunately in this case, you get what you pay for. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on an inferior product."
1,Add mine to the failed after 2 months pile,"I bought this to help with my cycling fitness rides by giving me the heart rate data I wanted easily. Namely the average heart rate for the session and the max heart rate I hit. The unit is a snap to use and the display is fine.Strap on the monitor, wet it a little with some water and off I went. The watch paired with the sensor almost immediately.It worked well for nearly two months.Unfortunately like so many others here the unit has stopped working properly. I get a HR for the first few minutes, after a very long pairing time and then the rate just keeps on dropping during the session. Very disappointing.I am doing nothing different. I tried changing the battery to the sensor but same result.Not sure what my next move is but I can not recommend this unit base on this two month trial."
2,Definitely could have been designed better!,"Just got it in the mail and wanted to try it out. Watch seems great and was really easy to set up. No problems with that. It's the chest strap that could use improvements. You have to pull it over your head and down to your chest, which makes it pretty difficult to get on and off. As a female, this really is a pain!"
3,works fine - lacks advertised features,"Not as advertised. Product description says: ""Target Zone- Preset your desired heart rate exercise zone; Alarm notification when you are not in zone- Time in Zones- Spent within your selected heart rate target zone- %-of-Max Heart Rate Display or BPM- Recovery Heart Rate Timer- Measure your heart rate after a timed recovery during or after your workout..."" This model does not have any of those features - at least they were not in the users' manual and I can't find them. That's the description of a different model, I guess.Does have: heart rate, elapsed time of workout, time of day, date. After a workout you can recall length of workout, avg heart rate, and maximum heart rate.OK product, decent price, just be aware of the features you're getting."
2,Failure to Launch,"Received this watch promptly, as I have come to expect from Amazon. I was very excited to finally use this set, unfortunately, the heart rate monitor would not even turn on. I was able to set the time and date without issue, but after multiple attempts to get the HR working I gave up. Am returning this to Amazon. I cannot rate how accurate nor well this worked so my rating is simply on ""right out of the box"""
5,Good basic heart rate monitor.,"This is a good basic heart rate monitor. The numbers are big and easy to see on the watch. Some people complain that the heart rate is wildly off, but that can happen with any chest strap monitor. If it is too loose or too low it might bounce as you run and that adds to the pulse it picks up, or sometimes it doesn't get a good reading and is much too slow. You just need to readjust the strap, usually just lift it up in back. This watch doesn't have a stop watch mode, but it will keep a record of the time you turn on the monitor mode on the watch. This chest strap is read by all of the machines at our sports center, treadmills, spin bikes, elliptical trainer, etc.. I can use this chest strap with my old watch from a different company, so I use it for runs because I can use the stop watch."
4,Works great for the price,"The directions clearly say that you should moisten the back of the monitor strap first, and if you do that, this works great. Seems to pick up the signal better than my polar monitor this replaced, and if you are looking for basic functions -- heart rate, average rate during workout, and peak rate during workout, then you can't beat this timex monitor."
1,Save your money,"I just got this gizmo a couple of days ago and it doesn't work. Oh, it'll keep time but it's not going to tell you how fast your heart is pumping. I've tried getting the sensor wet until if I wanted it to be wetter, I'd have to get in the shower. Once it did work but I had to have the receiver touching the chest sensor. Not really what I'm looking for while excersizing.Save your money and spend it on something else that possibly works."
4,Good quailty for the price,I would recommend this item. The quality is good and so far it works well.
4,Good Product,Works as advertised. Easy set-up. Good for those who want the basics in a Heart Rate Monitor.
2,Not your daddy's Timex,I purchased the Timex to continually monitor my heart rate during exercise. I chose the Timex based on its reasonable price and Timex's reputation for reliability. The monitor only works intermittently and when it does work the a reading it is not reliable. I consider it a wast of money and would not recommend it.
5,Exceeded Expectations,I thought I would have to pay a lot more for a HRM. The timex has worked fine for a month. I use it at the gym where the machines pick it up as well as the wristband. I also use it to keep track of stress while biking. I would highly recommend.
4,I like it,"I have just started running and wanted to monitor my heart rate. I have been using this monitor for a month, every Mon-Wed-Fri, and it works very well and I have not had any problems."
1,Times heart monitor,"I have not been able to get the heart monitor to work properly, despite a replacement sent to me by Timex. I suspect the battery is not current and will now replace that myself at an additional cost to me. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,lasted 13 months,I have had this watch for a little over a year and has been satisfactory. The readings were sometimes all over the place so I replaced the battery on the strap at least twice during that time. Here lately the chest strap and watch have not been syncing so I replaced the watch battery even though it still had bright appearance. Still not syncing. Expected it to last a little longer than it did. Looking at Polar now to see if longer lasting.
1,Poor Quality,I have had to replace the batter three times since March 2012. It is December 2012. It just doesn't' work well. I found this out today when I almost passed out and noticed it wasn't keeping me heart rate at all.
5,Great for those looking to get out of their comfort zone,"Klayton, the lead member of Celldweller has been releasing underground hits for years. This CD as well as the original brings a great mix of rock, blues, techno, orchestra and other mix genre music.There's really nothing out there like it that I can find. His orchestra is better than most movie scores and his technofied rock it cooler and better tweaked than Linkin Park. You can't go wrong with this as you seem to get Nine Inch Nails, Chemical Bros, Miri Ben-Ari (Violinist), Linkin Park, and Korn all in one!I hear he's doing movie soundtracks now. Good for him. Just don't lose that underground touch!I would also recommend Criss Angel.Effrem J. Adams"
1,Not on main album for a reason,"I love the original album and was excited when I final broke down and bought the beta cessions. I bought it based on the high reviews on this site and was expecting all kinds of good things since the original CD is hit after hit, but the Beta Cessions is awful.There is a good reason why none of these made it on to the first album, they just aren't up to the same level of quality as their primary versions off the original CD.Don't waste your time, spend your money on something else..."
5,This is Ani at her best.,"If you don't like this album, you don't like Ani DiFranco, and you may well be dead.The lyrics (""life used to be life-like, now it's more like showbiz"") are razor-sharp, the music is stellar (standouts are the title track and Shameless), and the song selection holds together very well."
5,this cd is amazing,"i was not an ani fan until i heard this cd. in an age of one hit wonders and boy bands, ani brings to the table thoughtful lyrics and an honest voice. don't hesitate to buy this cd.... out of my collection of 300 cd's i would have to pick this disc as my all time favorite."
4,Shameless Self-Expression,"This was the album that turned me on to Ani Difranco, and given its rich, intensely personal lyrics, it is no surprise that I remain a diehard fan. Now that I am more familiar with Ani's work, I sill enjoy the album - but only when I am in the mood for something a little lower energy than Living In Clip (my all time favorite).Many of the songs on this album continue to touch a nerve with me, especially those with raw vulnerability and anger like ""Dilate"" and ""Adam and Eve."" Overall the content of this album is what I have come to expect from Ani. She has a wonderful ability to meld raw words with funky music resulting in a beautifully flowing album. Self-expression at its best can be found with Dilate - cocky, cheeky, and shameless!"
4,My second copy of this CD - I love it!,"Dilate will always be the Ani Difranco-defining CD for me, since it was the first I'd heard of her. I've owned 2 copies and listened to it for years, and never get tired of it. My favorite track is her version of ""Amazing Grace""."
5,This is album is for all music lovers,I fell in love with Ani Difranco the moment I put this cd in my player. Her unique sound is just what kids (like myself) need to hear. Her lyrics are inspriering and make sense. I love this cd.
4,A Must Have for Any Woodworker,"I use this curved blade spokeshaves to take off stock material in my custom muzzleloader shop. I use the curved blade one to prevent any true flat sides from forming. Easy to resharpen and take apart, but getting back to where its easiest to cut with minimal effort takes quite a bit of adjustment and trying. But this piece of iron will keep going long after I am gone."
3,Toggle parts missing,The toggles arrived in on time. There were three in the order howerver one of the toggles was incomplete and had only the leaver but not the screw and stop end was missing. The other two worked just fine. O well no one is perfect. I decided the other two made up for the company(seller) error. It is still a great product and highly recommend it for its purpose.
1,Order has not arrived,"I ordered this item two months ago now. It said it was on backorder, but would ship within a month. It is now two months later and they say it won't ship until January. I would cancel, but I ordered this item with another tool and was able to use a discount code. This item was essentially free due to the discount. What's the point in cancelling if it is already paid for and I can't get any money back?!?!"
5,Here are the dimensions,"Smeesh; products like these really need to include trivial details like the dimensions, so here they are:Overall dimensions: 1-3/4"" wide by 4-3/4"" long by 5-1/2"" high (with handle in vertical position).Mounting holes: 1/4"" diameter, spaced 3/4"" by 1-1/4"", total base footprint is 1-3/4"" by 1-5/8"".Spindle clamping height: adjustable from 1/4"" to -1/8"" using the included hardware (you'll have to build a base adapter to clamp thicker materials).Spindle (center) distance to edge of base: adjustable from 3/4"" to 2-1/2"".Spindle contact size: 1/2"" diameter.Spindle tip is not replacable (it's fused to the spindle bolt).Heavy duty construction (0.12"" thick steel), riveted together.Delivery is going to be hard to beat; I ordered mine on a Friday, it shipped Sunday (that's a good trick), and it arrived Monday via USPS.Five stars for the product itself, but only one star for not including the dimensions."
1,American Pie Wanna Be.....and a bad one at that.,"Total waste of your time. The story is very familiar by now. College partying, a few topless women, normal teen movie stuff. All the cast is unfamiliar. Women are not even decent looking. The entire movie is boring to say the least. It never grabs your interest. How people like this mindless crap I will never know. Lots of decent movies in this class, this isn't one of them."
3,its fine,"i cant find this movie. we just moved and its in a box somewhere, but when i watched it when i first got it, it worked. i was expecting something funny, like a comedy, but it was a stupid one. its the kind that u laugh at instead of with. it kinda reminded me of american pie at first because of what its about from the back of the movie, but american pie is way funnier then this one"
4,"Uplifting,eclectic,energetic,sensual,and original","I happened to be introduced to this group about four years ago.I heard ""Take Your Time"" and thought it was a good song.A couple years later,I bought the album and was shocked.The songs range from innuendo,sex,and love to the need for peace,dissed people getting a chance,and just plain chillin'.The Run songs (par.""Run Tings) don't make much sense.However,they did an excellent of Marvin Gaye's ""Sexual Healing"" and knocked my socks off with ""Everybody's Groovin'"" and ""Part Time Love Affair"".This is a cd I highly recommend taking a listen to."
2,Missing Music,"I got an e-mail today in which Amazon was requesting a review. The 2 stars are for ""hope"" since I do Like Amazon. I ordered this the end of November 2005. I still have yet to HEAR the CD. My hope is that the recording artist will deliver; this time better than Amazon did. Oh.. as of 1/15/06 NO CD YET! Maybe once it actually comes I can review it."
4,SRV Songs,"Excellent Insight into the Style and Songs that make SRV a Legend, Great Playing That will Inspire you to add These Techniques to your own Style. I would Have Rated it a 5 Star if they had utilized a Backing Track or Bass and Drums When Licks were Played Back."
2,OK but lacking in accuracy...,I bought this DVD hoping it would show the entire songs. It does not. Pretty much hits the parts here and there. I have been looking for a DVD that shows you every thing played and found it after buying this. It was found at www.note4note.us. Amazing accuracy and the entire song is taught which is pretty amazing.
2,ok.,"well, I have all of Elvis's cds and some of him when he was in Grupo Mania. I love Pintame, but the remixes in English are retarted. I like listening to the beats, and that is why I bought the remixes, I have the remixes for Suavemente and these are similar. I would not recommend buying it. the beats are more dancable for ""club dancing"" but if you like the latino chevere cosas then get teh real thing."
2,"Not quite ""La Cosa""!","I love the song Píntame. The music on this CD is fun and danceable, but the English lyrics left me a bit cold. They are not an actual translation of the merengue version which is really a better song. I also miss the backup singers from the merengue recording. I was looking for the version that goes with the music video. For anyone who has not seen it on GEMS jams or Tu Ritmo, it is the techno dance music with the original Spanish lyrics and its great. I bought this CD expecting to find it. Does anyone know where Elvis' fans can purchase that recording? In the mean time, I'll just have to play it on my VCR."
4,HazMat?,[...]the 'camping for less'link shows which fuel canisters can be shipped UPS without a HazMat fee imposed by the government. Bruntan 4 oz cans will ship without the tariff. The post office will not ship any fuel canisters at all of any brand.So Bruntan is a good way to go in fuel canisters if you are ever going to be buying fuel from internet or mail order. Because at least 4oz size currently can be bought without a ridiculous $[...] fee per canister.
1,Two in a row where the ignition doesn't work,"Everything about this stove is amazing - small size, foldable, light weight, easy to use . . . EXCEPT . . . I've purchased and returned two of them because the ignition hasn't worked on either. If you don't mind carrying around a lighter, it's all well and good, but if I'm paying for a feature, I'd like for it to work.I called Brunton (7/28/10), and they stated that they have been having trouble with these and are redesigning, with the new version out in a month. So maybe don't write the Raptor off entirely, but hold off on purchasing it until they get the design improved a bit."
2,Little Ripper,"The stove itself is good. The piezo igniter hasn't worked yet. Maybe needs some sort of adjustment. Performance of the stove though is quite good, but I have little faith in the igniter.Update:Mine had the same issue and it had nothing to do with fuel. With the piezo you can see the spark jump and on mine it works 1 out of 20 times even after some bending adjustments. The other issue is the stove seems to lose pressure when running for a couple of minutes. This is even on a new cannister of fuel. To be fair I am using MSR canisters but I am not sure why that would make a difference. So If I had to make the purchase again I would go with the MSR equivalent that doesn't have the igniter."
1,Very misleading product listing - beware!,"Amazon has several listings for the Brunton Raptor camping stove. The product description for the one from Apex Supplier says: ""Brunton Raptor Stove w/Butane 4 oz, One Size by Brunton"" yet the stove comes from Apex without the 4 oz Butane canister, also shown in the photo. The same product from another company, listed on the same Amazon page, is priced approx $5 less. I purchased the more expensive Apex version only because it specifically indicates by the words ..."" w/Butane 4 oz..."" that the canister was included. I questioned Apex and they said that somewhere in the data it says the canister is not included. Naturally I would have ordered from the less expensive source, had this been evident. I am not going to go to the trouble of re-packaging and returning the item, at further expense. However, naturally I feel cheated."
1,Beware of cheaters,The Stove comes with no canister!!! Take into consideration when buying it. you're just paying more than 30$ for a small piece of metal.... This is called cheating! i expected canister with fuel at least. The description doesn't say (for the time i'm submitting the review) that the product comes without canister. im disappointed as far as i am going camping/backpacking in a week and i really needed and counted on that f**king stove:(((((
1,chanter reed,I purchased chanter reeds twice. The first time one of three was useable. The second time one of five was useable. There will not be a third time.
5,FOR ALL YOU NON-BELIEVERS,"Regardless of what ANYONE else thinks, Ms Browne is dead-on. Her predictions may be off, but she herself admits that these things come to her on a vague definition-basis. She doesn't necessarily control what she sees, she just accepts it from Raheim and Francine (who are they - GO FIND OUT!) For the true ""Browne Believers"" we agree that Mother Azna and Father God have gifted Sylvia with a true gift and she is doing her best to use it. She, as well as her fans, knows that there will be skeptics and 'non-believers' but she says ""I encourage it!"" (""Contacting Your Spirit Guide"")So before you go slamming Ms Browne for using her gifts and talents, why don't you go slam yourselves for ONLY looking at the negativities of this truly amazing woman and writing a bad review only for your benefit.GREAT BOOK SYLVIA - AS USUAL!!!"
2,I Use to Love Sylvia...,"It's true... I loved her book 'On the Otherside'...but, then I began thinking about all those major unsolved murder cases in this country. The Green River Killer who has killed 30 - 40 women and it took 20 years for hime to get caught. Or the Scott Peterson case, Or the murder of the little blond girl, etc...if she is a real psychic then why doesn't she or others make a quick phone call to the police and provide them with a vision.I saw this show on how much psychics really help solve crimes and it's only about 10% of the time? That show convinced me that psychics just don't exits. The police said, if there were real psychics then we wouldn't need police. Good Point. Sylvia provides hope...and comfort.I prefer to believe in quantum physics... that we have control over our own energy.arihttp://arihinnant.com"
4,prophet or not? who cares.,"I have seen many reviews on here arguing about if Sylvia is a prophet or not. Does it matter? I may believe or not believe in many of Sylvia's predictions or beliefs, but I can say this, all of her books that I have bought have been a great entertaining read, well written and have left me feeling good about the world and myself.This price is well worth the entertainment value."
2,Prophecy: What the future holds for you,"It is easy to do any predictions in generalities. It leaves an attitude of ""might be"" or ""might not be"". Also the science fiction of yesterday is reality today, so look back gather up past evidence and do a modern day prediction. Why research Edgar Cayce to make predictions if one had a link to the future as she claims? Cayce did the provoking for ideal thinking and I think she is cashing in on it."
1,Save your money,"Sylvia Browne has produced some excellent works, some educational and some just entertaining. I got the CDs of this, and was really disappointed. She spent 2/3 of the CDs on meditation and what other people had said, a kind of featherweight venture into syrupy pseudophilosophy. The number of actual predictions which she makes is very small and narrow. The whole thing is disappointing, probably the least effective thing she's done."
1,For Sci-Fi Fans Only,"How did Sylvia Browne miss the tsunami and 9-11? Browne finds a way to avoid critics in Prophecy: What The Future Holds For You, by making the vast majority of her predictions for the VERY distant future (2020 +++), that way she has no fear of being called on them. As she is at this time a senior citizen.Some predictions she TOTALLY AVOIDED in this are; but are not limited to:1. No celebrity predictions.2. She does not name ANY future presidential candidates.3. No political predictions such as the fates of the European Union, Russia, China, Syria, .... No, that would be way toooo easy to be called on, thus her TOTALLY eliminating them from her work.So over all if your into sci-fi in a big way this book is for you. If you are looking for what the future holds for you, you would have better luck in cracking open a fortune cookie than this piece of work."
2,Sylvia Browne's predictions,"Sylvia Browne has left out some very important predictions in her Book of Prophecy such as: who will win the Presidential Election in 2004, 2008, and 2012.HB"
3,Not interesting,Not going to believe in all of the doom and gloom.Recomending: The Discovery of Dreams A-Z
1,???500 years from now???,"On the Montel Williams show Sylvia Brown specifically said looking 100 years forward she cannot see anything which she takes to mean that civilization as we know it will cease to exist!! SO why is this book giving predictions 500 years in the future??? Common Sylvia if people are to believe you stay consistant with what you say, cause there are skeptics out here like me to catch you!"
4,Call me crazy...,"but, I thought this book was great and extremely interesting. Her predictions about things in the future are not that far fetched at all. And being a cancer survivor, if her idea behind the cure for cancer is even 1% remotely possible, she totally had my buy-in and I'm a skeptic! Hopefully some doctor will get a hold of her idea! Things she described are totally plausible. Loved it."
2,predictions.. accurate??,"I just finished the book and Sylvia's prophesies are pretty far out there in some cases. In other cases, like her predictions for how our schools and learning in general turn out... I really hope this is true and will happen. Our school systems & drive of students is in desparate need of some restructuring. I like the idea of how computers will be in the future. But I keep hearing predictions of the United States over the last 25 years that are doom and gloom and it doesn't happen. I don't believe our cities will be under a bubble by the year 2020.. seems pretty far out. She does remind readers in the book that if a prophet or phsychic claims to be 100% correct, then they are false."
4,Come On Cut Her Some Slack,"Now let's cut Sylvia some slack folks. This is the first book of Ms. Brownes I have read, as I really just have not been drawn to her. She seems a bit ""Cold"" to me. But like most Americans at this time I am interested in what the future holds in wartime. So I bought it.She has made some BOLD long term predictions here that most psychic stay away from. So time will tell if she is legit or not. If she is she will leave legacy similar to Edgar Cayce (Which she seems to hold in high esteem in the book). If she is not she will slide into the land of ""Has Beens"" such as the likes of the ""Saved By The Light Man"" um what was his name ........? I just Googled it, it was Brinkley.The point being she has placed her career and reputation on the line, so for that alone I am going to cut her some slack and give her 4 stars instead of 3. As it did flabbergast me a bit that she left on key upcoming predictions (current elections, Israel's situation and such), but she has tried."
3,Not her Greatest,"I have been a fan of Sylvia Browne ever since I first saw her on the Montel Williams show. This book is somewhat boring. The only part I really liked was the beginning because it had some history, but when it came to the prophecies, it became boring and somewhat stupid. Sylvia is about seventy, so has researched alot and knows what she's talking about, but skip this one. It was kind of bad that I just skipped to the end and didn't really finish."
5,Collector of Sylvia Browne Books,Another great book to read over many times. Great addition to home libary. Thanks for the sale and quick delivery of product. AAA+++++++
5,Leaves you wanting more,"Regrettably, only the choruses were presented from Handel's ""Messiah"". I admired how all the scenes were held long enough for the viewer to fully examine the objects being shown. No stupid camera tricks here; a welcome relief from the quick-cutting, rapid scanning music videos of today where you never really see anything much. It would have helped to have subtitles available to explain what you were seeing, rather than the tedious way you had to access single screens of information. I minor quibble about an otherwise excellent presentation."
2,"Lovely Scenery, Nice Music, No Orchestra","I thought the Messiah would be filmed full orchestra within the beautiful church in Bavaria. Not so. Although the country of Bavaria is very pretty and the inside of the church quite ornate I was hoping that would only be the setting for the musicians and singers. Rather than sitting down for an hour to watch, one could safely have it playing without video as background music."
2,No fue lo que esperaba,"Cuando lei las criticas, pense que tal vez no eran justas, pues despues de escuchar el disco, estoy de acuerdo con algunas criticas, para la edad de Thalia, yo pense que saldria con mejores canciones, definitivamente la de 24000 besos se la deberia de haber dejado a una adolecente, ya no esta en edad para estar cantando esas canciones (muy cursi). Tal vez quiera mantener contento a ese publico adolecente, pero debe de pensar que habemos muchos de su edad, que la seguimos y que debe de crecer como cantante, tendremos que esperar a ver que tal su proximo disco, espero que no me decepcione otra vez. Las unicas canciones que valen la pena son Amar sin ser Amada, y un alma sentenciada, tal vez la de oldivame. Suerte a todos los que piensan comprar el disco."
1,Thalia esta estancada y ya solo hace musica basura,"Thalia ultimamente deja mucho que desear, ella nunca debio emprender el Crossover ya que nunca estuvo realmente preparada para enfrentar al gran mercado anglosajon. Las canciones son muy repetitivas, siempre los mismos ritmos y las mismas letras. Espero que reconozca que este disco es una basura y que cambie de productores. ""Amar sin ser amada"" es una fiel copia a todos sus temas anteriores."
1,Give it up,Not even Tommy could save this CD. Think her singing career is over.This album is over produced.
4,VERY GOOB CD NOT THAT BEST..!!!!!!!!!!1,"YES I LOVE THALIA BUT I GUESS THIS CD IS NOT THAT BEST BUT IS VERY GOOB TO HEAR IT..........ALOT OF VERY GOOB SONG ""ALMA SENTENCIADA"",BUT I LIKE MORE IN DANCE MIX, AND IN REGGAETON.""SEDUCCION"",AND MORE, I GUESS SHE CAN REALLY SING SHE DID IT IN SELENA VIVE IN LIVE AND IN LATIN GRAMMY 2003 TOO.......!!!!!!!!!!!BUT I BEEN TWO YEAR AGO IN THALIA TOUR IN NY. AND SHE DID PLAYBACK"" I HOPE IN THIS NEW TOUR NOT ""PLAYBACK""........AND MORE DANCE ......YOU GO THALIA ............IF YOU IN LOVE BUY THIS CD........IF U NOT BUY IT TOO........IS GREAT......."
1,Nothing new!,"Is this Kylie Minogue? No, it's Thalia with her new album. This is a complete disappointment to her loyal fans."
1,Thalia is beautiful but she should stick to acting in Novelas!,"I've been following Thalia's carer since when she was in Timbiriche with Paulina Rubio and the rest of tha gang. I will give Thalia some points for being brave when it comes to singing. I think Thalia is nice to look at but HORRENDOUS to listen to. She should use her ""new"" resources and take singing lessons. Mariah at least had a voice before she drifted into trashinnes. So, Thalia, there's still hope for you. Just concentrate on learning English really well and learn how to SING. This album doesn't showcase anything new. In fact this album tries to cover up ""Maria Mercedes"". Thalia should have been past ""Maria Mercedes"" by now. This voice still sounds like it's hungry for some voice lessons."
5,THIS IS MY BEST ALBUM EVER........,WOW THALIA YOUR NEW ALBUM IS AWESOME IT'S THE BEST ALBUM I COULD GET IN MY WHOLE LIFE!!!!ALL THE LYRICS IN IT ARE GOOD NICE RYTHMS A GREAT VOICE WITH GREAT FEELINGS!GOOD JOB THALIA I WISH THE NEXT ENGLISH ALBUM WILL BE A SUCCESS LIKE THIS ALBUM!!!!!GOOD LUCK!
2,OK..,"this CD has some good songs but it's very easy to get tired of..as two people said before me, you know he never loved you sounds like one of shakira's songs..this isnt one of those CDs i can hear over and over again"
1,Worst Thalia Album,"The songs all sound like each other and unoriginal to me..amar sin ser amada reminds me of ""objection"" by shakira and i dont like that song"
1,same boring thalia,"Thalia never evolves musically. This album is horrible & her voice is hurtful to my ears. She should be the new ""Ms. Pujidos"" (moaner). Although she tried working once again w/ Estefano, to secure some success like Paulina Rubio's ""Paulina"" album, it wont work for her. She needs to be more original. Sorry Thalia, with all the money in the world and w/ Tommy by your side, you can't come out w a good album. Next time ask Paulina for some advise on how to come out w/ a great album."
3,The picture in the album is disturbing.,Only half of the songs are any good. She's done better. The picture in the album tells me that she is trying to hard. There was no need for the picture of herself touching herself :( So as to appeal to the [...] community. Not necessary. If people like her they like her for who she is and she doesn't have to try this very different marketing technique. She should just be herself...and this is coming from a Thalia fan.
2,Not one of her best,to make it simple this cd just does not grab you. it is just plain boring. i am a Thalia fan and she has done much better work in the past. this cd does not due her talent justice.
1,More of the same..........,"This is it! another mediocre album of ""La Reina de las telenovelas"", ASSA was a dissapoinment in the radio and none of the 15 songs will become hits! Buy Shakira's Fijacion Oral instead."
1,THALIA NEEDS SOME SINGING LESSONS!!,"Honestly, I think Thalia should take some singing lessons. The music is not bad, but her voice is annoying. There is no depth on her voice."
3,"Gripping, intense yet a bit disappointing","""Red Dragon"" is a wonderfully intense psychological thriller, with plenty of obsence violence and ""typical"" Thomas Harris plot twists. The story of the ex-FBI agent stalking the ""Tooth Fairy"" or ""Red Dragon"" is extremely interesting and detailed, right down to forensic and crime scene evidence. My disappointment was two fold. First, Hannibal Lecter is hardly in the book - there are references to what happened between him and Graham, and a few in-cell visits. But I was hoping for more ""pre-quel"" information about Hannibal. I'd love to see a book by Harris on the story of Hannibal and Graham. My second disappointment was the ending. It seemed a bit stagey and was not nearly as detailed as the rest of the book. The sub-plot of the difficulties between Graham and his wife seemed a bit unnecessary, as well. All in all, a good read and a good scare!"
1,Not worth reading with the lights off,"After reading Silence of the Lambs, I had high expectations for Red Dragon which unfortunately were not met. It wasn't as detailed as some of Harris' other books, and Lecters role was pathetically small. The book description gives the impression that Lecter is up to his old tricks, but there were none to be found. Not a total waste, the ending had an awesome twist to it that makes up for the mostly bland plot."
1,Mildly Interesting,"While I pursued this book to have read the full trilogy that involves Hannibal Lecter, I was seriously disappointed. While a partially interesting story, it is nothing outstanding. The thing that makes me angry is that this book has been marketed in the last two months as a ""must read"" so that you'll meet Hannibal Lecter the first time he was introduced. Lecter is marginal to this story and takes up a miniscule portion of the book. I believe it is unfair to be less that truthful to readers in preparing the marketing campaign for Hannibal (June 1999 publication.) This 1981 first is nothing in comparison to Harris' follow-up ""Silence of the Lambs"" -- truly a classic.Disappointed overall!"
1,"One of the worst, most boring books I've ever read.","After reading Silence of the Lambs, I figured I'd go back & see what other stuff Harris wrote. BIG mistake! Lecter is mentioned only marginally in this book & the story dragged so bad that it took me over a month to read it - I found too many other (better) books to read in the meantime. Believe me, this book was incredibly easy to put down. I'll give Harris a chance on Hannibal, but I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy."
3,This Book Is Okay,"This is supposed to be the third book in The Hannibale lecter legacy. But it's Actually the first. This book is okay. It's mainly about how dr. Hannibal lecter became who he was. I never heard of this book untile the movie was made. It struck me when it should of been the fisrt movie they made in the Hannibal Lecter Legacy. Oh well, begers can't be chooseer's. But Thomas harris did alot better on this book than he did on hannibal. The Movies Are Still Better.If You Liked This book check out the movie, soundtrack, The Silence Of The lambs & hannibal."
3,Good concepts...too bad about the writing,"The plot of _Red Dragon_ is among the best of the ""airport thriller"" genre. Thomas Harris' characters are believable and memorable, and they move through the novel realistically. ""Dragon"" has the makings of a top-notch thriller.Unfortunately, Harris' writing style gets in the way. Clumsy descriptions, and, more than anything, awkward dialogue are the main culprits. It's really a tribute to Harris' storyline and his other storytelling techniques that his writing problems do not get in the way of suspending disbelief or being on edge throughout the novel. His writing ends up just being an omnipresent annoyance that, with effort, can be ignored, like a soft buzzing that lasts the length of a movie.It's not heavy reading, and worth it just for the introduction to Hannibal Lecter, but I just wish Harris had a better editor or *some*thing. Everything to make it great is there, it just needs fine-tuning."
4,Quality Fiction!,"I just finished reading this novel, and I have to give Mr Harris a high-five! I loved this book because of the precision and detail accorded forensics, and the invitation of me, the reader, into both the protagonist's---and villain's---mind. I read Hannibal and wrote a negatively scathing review of Harris' writing style. But my opinion has changed after reading The Red Dragon. I enjoyed the caustic humor as he dished it out in the most unlikely spots. Good work...I mean, great work...Mr Harris. My eyes are now set on Black Sunday. Thanks for entertaining me."
4,VERY SUSPENSEFUL,"i plan to read silence of the lambs sometime soon, and hannibal also. i was only 1 when red dragon came out and im surprised a book that old could keep me reading on, but it did. i enjoyed it thoroughly."
4,"Not great, not terrible","This could have been much worse! The only problem was the ending, which seemed hurried and slapped together due to a deadline. Too bad, because the actual 'investigation' was engrossing - though the denouement was so disappointing that in my disgust I forgot that I actually enjoyed the rest of the book.If you're into forensic investigations, this book is for you. It was too technical for me, not enough action, not enough profiling . . . I won't be reading another. Though it was good while it lasted (see above: Four stars)."
2,Nothing to brag about,"Before reading ""Red Dragon,"" I read ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Hannibal."" I thoroughly enjoyed both of those books and was hoping to find the same suspense in this book. This book lacked suspense and seemed oddly familiar. The storyline was somewhat similiar to that of ""Silence of the Lambs,"" although it was no where near as good. Also, I was hoping that this book would explore the character of Hannibal Lector in more depth, like the book jacket suggests."
5,Among the best works of popular fiction in decades.,"Despite the fact that Tim Appelo, above, felt the need to ruin an otherwise suspensful and incredibly clever plot point, this is an absolute must-read. [If you don't know what I'm talking about--good. Avoid that review and just read the book.] Only those obsessed with the Hollywood-created celebrity of Hannibal Lecter (and those who wish to use Amazon.com as their own political soapbox) are disappointed by Red Dragon. Those who appreciate a well-spun yarn and a deep look inside the minds of the brilliant--both good and evil--aren't able to put this one down."
4,"Good, but . . . .","I agree as well with the earlier reviewer who thought ""The Triumph and the Glory"" or ""Schindler's List"" were more powerful examples of psychological terror unleashed an a massive scale, and dealt in an eloquent manner with the consequences that ensue from such horrors. But ""The Red Dragon"" aspires to no lofty heights, Harris is intent upon a focused tale of smaller dimensions and succeeds admirably."
4,Getting personal with a serial killer(s),"Red Dragon is a very scary and compelling read. In this story, Hannibal Lecter emerges into our culture as the psychiatrist who became an incredibly dangerous psychotic murderer who has been imprisoned in a hospital for the criminally insane. The FBI needs Lecter's help in tracking down yet another serial killer, the Red Dragon. The Dragon is an unbelievably frightening character who nearly seems omnipotent. He is intelligent, strong, ruthless, and totally twisted by a very abusive upbringing. He has already killed two entire families when the FBI steps in. What happens after that is a great story filled with details of detective sleuthing and delving into the ravaged psyche of a serial killer. This book is a page turner that will give you nightmares!"
5,This book makes you question what you decipher as reality.,"Once I picked up this book, I could not stop reading. Nor could I sleep. Unless of course I locked the windows, bolted the bedroom door, and tucked a knife within reach of my bed. This book has the ability to reach into your nightmares. Pretty scary stuff!"
2,What's the big deal?,"This book was recommended for me by readers of my favourite author - Dean Koontz. Saying it was as close to ""Intensity"" (the most suspenseful book I've ever read) as you can get. It took me about 2/3 through this book before it got my attention, and found it rather anti-climactic. Thumbs down!"
3,"Entertaining, but with predictable twists.","Thomas Harris writes a wonderfully visual story, and Red Dragon is no exception. I thought that Graham's character was wonderfully elaborate and complex....I wished for the same development in Dolarhyde's character. Yes, we learned bits and pieces of his twisted childhood, but I was left wanting more. I also found it predictable that he'd fall in love with someone and go through an internal struggle in which her life would hang in the balance. The ending also did not surprise me, I knew it was ""too easy"" to assume Dolarhyde was dead at that point in the book. All in all, I did enjoy this thriller...I just was hoping for a bit more depth."
4,Great book,I received this book in the mail two days after purchasing...If anyone is wondering how long this book is it has a total of 354 pages in it...I'm only on page 109 and so far it is a great book..trust me. take it from a person that is not a big fan of books. If you liked the movie Silence of the Lambs you will love this book!
3,Ehhh...,"There seemed to be a lot of plot tied into this story considering the length. You had to keep up with Graham's own struggle within himself, his marriage falling apart, the struggle to find the killer, the killer falling in love, and several other subplots. It seemed to be awfully busy considering. While there is a lot of death in the book it isn't overly descriptive so there isn't just a ton of gore but the abuse that Dolarhyde received as a child is just as unerring as any death could have been. Not a book I will sit down to read again but it wasn't just terrible."
5,Red Dragon,"To me, you better watch the movie before you read the book! Because if you do it the other way around, you seem to come away from the movie thinking something is missing. It is difficult to put all of the content from a book in to a movie, but this is especially so with a Thomas Harris novel. Red Dragon for me was very good. I saw ""Manhunter"" back in Germany in 1989 and was thrilled and surprised when finally got to read the novel the movie was loosely based on. I liked the movie, but after reading the book, it was almost like the Miami Vice version of Red Dragon."
5,The Stuff of Nightmares,Red Dragon is a book which made my flesh crawl. This novel is truly the stuff of nightmares. I remember several nights feeling a chill down my back as I read this terrifying book. Several times my heart felt like it was going to come out of my chest--it was that frightening! This is not a book for the casual reader; it should come with a warning. I personally loved every minute of it but I enjoy horror and let me tell you--this is absolute horror! This book will cause nightmares; it is that unsettling. I have never enjoyed being scared to death so much as with Red Dragon!
4,Almost perfect,"Have to say the last few chapters were the best with an excellent climax that I wasn't expecting. I personally think the story could have been wrappped up in less than the 300+ pages; this book seemed a bit wordier than Silence of the Lambs which was perfect. I would have given it five stars if it would have stayed on course but it seemed to veer off a lot with pages of storytelling that were getting tiring to read. I never really cared about the Molly/Willy story, would have liked more of Hannibal and would have liked more of Dolarhyde and the blind girl. All in all, a very good book and leaves me wanting more of this series."
2,Not nearly as good as Silence,"I read Silence of the Lambs before reading Red Dragon, and I started Dragon with great anticipation. I hoped the book would be as thrilling as Silence of the Lambs, but I was dissapointed. The book mentions Hannibal Lechter very little, and the ending of the book is far fetched and too quick. In short, the book was an okay read, although I prefer Silence of The Lambs."
2,Loved it up until the ending.,"I found this nearly impossible to put down. However, the lame, quickie ending filled me with such disgust that I flung the book across the room and vowed never to read Silence or Hannibal."
4,"Good, not great","While this is a good book and does offer a few thrills I never really felt drawn in. I read it over a period of three months - putting it down and then picking it back up, etc. - and never really felt the urge to keep reading it on into the night (the calling card of a good book). If you're a fan of Harris' you will probably like it (but avoid Hannibal at all costs)."
3,Facsinating look into the abnormal pyche.,Interesting but much to much foundation set for the investigator's. Grandmother's influence more than warranted.
4,First Dr. Hannibal Lecter tale.,"If you haven't heard of this one, it is likely because themovie version was called Manhunter. This is the first storyby Thomas Harris that introduces the diabolical characterDr. Hannibal Lecter. SILENCE OF THE LAMBS made a strongerimpression and fans. HANNIBAL seemed to be missing something butwas also good. IF you are looking for other Dr. Hannibal Lectercharacters, check out Stephen King's ""Black House"" and Ann M. Tempesta's ""Damsel in the Rough"""
3,"Solid story, runs out of steam at the end","As someone who is intrigued by stories of mass murderers and serial killers, I enjoyed this book almost all the way through to the end. It spent more time inside the killer's head than Silence of the Lambs spent with Buffalo Bill, portraying the conflicting thoughts and emotions that the Red Dragon was experiencing.However, because the book touts ""meeting Dr. Hannibal Lecter for the first time"", I was hoping for a bit more from the character that has fascinated me in Harris' next two novels. Aside from a couple of letters received from Lecter, he is not involved with the story as much as I would have liked. I guess his popularity hadn't risen to the point it was after the second story.Last, I would have hoped for a better ending than this. There was a lot of leading up to a grand conclusion (which kept me on the edge of my seat) but it did not have the final impact that I've come to expect from Harris."
4,An unrealistic ending to a terrific book (2/28/02),"This book is so good that the ending is surprisingly disappointing. It's unrealistic and would just never happen. Serial killers don't behave, or change this way.It reminded me of the end of Harris' other book, Hannibal. An FBI agent is going to actually let a serial killer get in her head to the point of running off with him? I think not."
3,Not That Great-Disappointed,"I was a bit disappointed by Red Dragon. If Dragon is supposed to be better than Hannibal, than I will save myself the price of the Hannibal paperback and just skip it entirely. Red Dragon just wasn't as 'scary,' gory or horrific as I had hoped. I read Lambs years ago and thought it was great, as was the movie."
4,A great read. It'll keep you glued.,"I am one of the many who picked up this book after watching the movie ""Hannibal"". That said, I'd also like to give a quick tid bit about myself: I graduated from the same college as Mr. Demme, the director of ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Hee hee. Enough about me, on to the review. Although I got hooked by the fact that Lecter was in it, I ended up not even remembering that fact due to the gripping stories behind the main characters. Instead of hoping to find out a little more about Hannibal, I found myself dying to turn the page and find out why Dollarhyde did the things he did. (I didn't give anything away by telling you who the killer is) Truly a gripping novel! Only four stars because I felt like the final confrontation was a bit rushed for our villain. It didn't quite fit him. Read it and judge for yourself."
5,Red Dragon,"I read this book many years ago, and have recommended it to dozens of people. My own paperback copy is probably out there circulating somewhere. A truly awesome book, not for the faint of heart."
4,A Great Book,"I enjoyed Red Dragon as mauch as I did The Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal by Harris. After reading the reviews, I was hoping that Dr. Lechter would play a bigger role in the story, which was not case. Still Harris maintained the excitement throughout the book. Although the expected ending was pretty 'uneventful', the book was very pleasant to read."
3,Disappointed,"The hype for this book does not match the story. It was well-written, but not nearly as intense as suggested by other reviews. I would not recommend it for someone seeking a thriller, but it isn't a bad read."
3,Red Dragon,"Again my review, not my husband. Not good as I thought, nothing as good as Silent of the Lambs and they kept saying this was a scary book. Really I didn't find it that way. It was O.K. but not exceptional as they said it was. I was disappointed really."
4,Red Dragon,"Loved it. As good as the recent movie. However, I was severely disappointed in the ending. Other than that, awesome."
4,My favoritest read,"I loved it. I read Steven King because of the way he decribes his characters, I didn't realize until this book, that Harris is equally as gifted. I could see and smell Will, and Dollarhide, they were developed masterfully. Unfotunatly, i haven't found a book that holds my interest since i finished it. It was wonderful!"
4,Prepare to enter the broken psyche of a serial killer,"An extremely tense and involving horror/thriller thatactually brings you into the mind of a serial killer.The story involves one Will Graham an ex-cop who has""retired"" because his work was hitting a little tooclose to home. When a series of murders baffle theF.B.I., the only person who has a prayer to stop thekiller is Will. He has less than a month beforethe killer strikes again... and what ensues is a pulsepounding descent into the mind of the killer."
3,"Pretty Good, but With Flaws","This book satisfied my ""murder mystery"" desire, don't get me wrong, but didn't live up to the billing, and certainly wasn't as compelling as Silence of the Lambs (especially the movie). The action scenes and descriptions of the police trying to put the clues together were very good, original, and crisply written, but I was disappointed with the bizarre details of the killer's infatuation with the 'Red Dragon' painting. I thought this was a silly supplemental explanation for the killer's behavior (beyond his tragic childhood)."
4,Forget watching 'Manhunter' and read the book instead!!,"Once again proof is offered that nothing compares to reading the story instead of watching it! True, 'Manhunter' evokes the disturbing atmosphere surrounding Will Graham and his empathy with serial killers. Yet nothing in the film even comes close to the strength of the storyline and the paced unravelment of the 'plot'. The psyche of the killer is described through a narrative of his youth in only a few pages, yet this makes him frighteningly human to the reader! This probably makes out the strength of this novel, paced at perfection and gripping right up to the very end!"
3,Genre Fiction,"This is good genre fiction. It is better than the movie. However, like most genre fiction it is rather superficial. I guess that is to be expected. Also the story relies on building tension and the now hackneyed interweaving of two stories (Graham's relation with his wife and Dolarhyde's spree killing). But Harris does not quite pull it off. The resolution is predictable. This is a variation on a standard theme. Harris tried to combine the psychological thriller with the serial killer/spree killer theme but with little success. Despite all this the book is an entertaining read."
4,Unfair to parents and psychiatrists,"It is a well written page turner. My main main objection is the attempt to explain Dollarby's crimes in terms of his unhappy childhood. Amongst the victims of the most vicious criminals are their innocent parents who, in most cases (such as McVeigh and Gancy) have done their best for their children and are stigmatized by this kind of spurious pop psychology, derived from old Hollywood movie versions of psychoanalysis. It is possible for parents to screw up their children but they are seldom to blame for their children's crimes.As a psychiatrist, I may be a little prejudiced against Thomas Harris. Very few of my colleagues are like Dr Lecter."
3,Predictable,It starts off strongly but it eventually falls into some pretty predictable plot lines for this genre. I don't know if its because Red Dragon has inspired other books or if Harris was pulling from the same sources that the other books pulled from too.
2,Not that good.,"This book did nothing for me. I am not impressed. I have read many books that kept my attention and made me hunger for more, but not this one, and there wasn't much reference to Hannibal Lecter as one might think by reading the cover and foreword. I was totally unimpressed. It was very boring and I found myself skipping ahead to find the action."
5,Gripping -- Gruesome -- Genuine -- A lexicon of adjectives!,"""Red Dragon"" was a brilliant work of a cat-and-mouse drama. When the book says ""Meet Hannibal Lector for the first time!"" -- they mean it. Although Hannibal's part is extremely limited, and only is in a few chapters, Harris sets us up for a repetative character that will never lose hype in his future novels.""Red Dragon"" was made into a horrible, low budget, typical 80's movie named ""Manhunter"".The author of such other great, critically acclaimed work including ""Black Sunday"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", and ""Hannibal"" is a genius at getting inside the characters minds and really opening them up to the reader.In this particular novel, Harris explores the killer, Francis Dolarhyde's mind. He goes into his past, upbringing and you actually can feel sorry for the killer. This novel is full of spirit, suspense and is written craftsmanly and well. Thumbs up!"
5,Red Dragon---A tricky story.,"The killer, Dolarhyde, has a story behind him that leaves little to the imagination....however I wish the author, Thomas Harris, would have gone into more detail to explain this killer's sociopathic tendencies.....I was a little confused by some of his actions, considering his background story. I have seen some of William Blake's work, I have even seen a copy of the RED DRAGON painting...it's startling.The book itself is beautifully well done, the author took special care to note even the smallest tendencies of his characters......except for Lecter, of course...But that was all to be explained in Hannibal, which is also a wonderful, and also strange book."
5,Murder by numbers. 123....,"The story of Francis, the ""incarnation"" of Blake's Red Dragon has a descriptive insight into the mind of an ""insane"" serial killer."
4,Interesting Thriller Keeps You Going.,"I decided to take a break from the norm and read a novel dubbed as a 'psychological thriller'.I liked this novel. Mainly I wanted to read about killer Hannibal Lecter since he seems to be a large icon in the horror/suspense world. This novel only introduces him. We do get a great thriller though. The chase to capture the killer in this novel does have it's suspense. I am looking forward to reading Silence of the Lambs now. If the movie 'Manhunter' ever comes out on DVD I think I will get it too, since it's the film based on this novel."
2,Wildly overrated,"Just as Hannibal is severely underrated by its critics, so is Red Dragon overrated. I reread this novel in preparaton for Hannibal's release and was amazed at how it is grimly locked into its formula. It follows the traditional serial killer novel right down to the predictable ending. The villian isn't very interesting and Will Graham is an unlikable and pretty boring protagonist. It does, however, manage to hold your attention all the way through. It is well-written but nothing out of the ordinary. After the transcendant experience of reading Hannibal, this book is heading to the used bookstore."
2,Uninteresting,"After reading ""Hannibal', 'Red Dragon' just couldn't compare. I suffered through 'Red Dragon' because so many of the negative comments about 'Hannibal' seemed to mention how wonderful 'Red Dragon' was in comparison.Sorry. My equation has worked out differently. 'Red Dragon' is a genre novel, locked within the given parameters; it never travels beyond. The cop is only slightly interesting. The serial killer isn't interesting at all.In 'Hannibal', genre is transcended. The reader has no idea where the journey will end, and once at its end the reader has no idea how to feel. Is the end good or bad, or simply banal? Well, I found the ending of 'Hannibal' profoundly disturbing and so much more intriguing than the ending of 'Red Dragon'.For those of you who like typical books with typical endings, this one is for you."
3,Great for a suspense novel,This is a suspense novel that actual brings suspense. Through most of the book you really don't know what is going to happen next and you really can't wait to see. The character of the Red Dragon ( a Norman Bates meets Jack the Ripper)is written so effectively you don't know whether to hate him or root for him. The only down side to this book was the ending. I found it a bit cliche and a little predictable. Can't wait to see the flick based on this ditty - Manhunter.
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"Red Dragon is one of the most exiting, thrilling and twisted books I've ever read. The writing is fantastic and the characters genuine. Both thumbs up - definatly one of Thomas Harris' best works"
4,Harris' best.,"The Red Dragon is Harris' best novel. I just came off from reading HANNIBAL. That book was a bunch of garbage. The Red Dragon was written in the eighties were Harris wasn't as rich. His development of characters and the sad, but somewhat realistic ending is what cathces me in this book. Thumbs to Red Dragon, Black Sunday, and SOTL."
3,OK but nothing really new here,Red Dragon WAS a turn-the-page clone of SIlence of the lambs but i guess if it aint broke dont fix it. Only Left Behind and The Triumph and Glory keopt me as mesemerized as Red Dragon. It is very intense and says a lot of about human psychology.
5,Great Suspense novel,"The prequel to Silence of the Lambs, Thomas Harris' Red Dragon, is a very suspensful read. I couldn't put it down after I began.Highly Recommended."
2,Disappointing Reader,"This review is in regards to the unabridged book on tape of Red Dragon. I find it to be quite disappointing. The reader appears to make little effort to use character voices, instead simply reading the book almost in a neutral tone. I find it difficult to tell which charcter he is voicing at any given time. The book on it's own, however, is highly enjoyable."
4,If You Liked Silence of the Lambs...,"You'll also enjoy ""The Red Dragon."" More of the same although, chronologically, 'Dragon' came first. Clarice Starling, the proponent of 'Lambs', didn't appear in this novel, but the book possesses the same intensity and attention to detail as 'Lambs'. The all male cast is interesting, with well-developed characters, and the 'bad guy' is focused not on large women, as in Lambs, but on urban, middle-class families. I haven't yet read 'Hannibal', but I look forward to it."
5,Creepy but Riveting,"Thomas Harris has created one of America's great fictional characters, or rather monsters, Hannibal Lecter. This book pre dates The Silence of the Lambs and introduces Dr. Lecter to us. Once you start this book you just have to finish it. Evil is palpable when Harris introduces the reader to his protagonist and the reader is taken on a frightening journey into the mind of a madman."
5,A must read for all Thriller/Suspense/Mystery fans !,"This is the book that turns me into a Thriller/Suspense/Mystery avid fan ! A plot with lots of twists, an excellent portrayal of characters and amazing writing skills. Thisbook will be one of the most memorable novelfor me. WELL DONE Harris !"
4,Heart Pounding Thriller,"Red Dragon brings a killer to life and into your home. A rampt psycho killer is out there being controled by another force. He must fulfill his duty and ""Become."" The retired Will Graham is brought out of retirement to look into the mind of this psychopath and the killer is urged on more by the publicity he recives. Readers beware, this book is not for the light hearted"
4,A delightful romp through the mind of the insane...,"As a student in criminal justice, this book is assigned in our profiling courses. As a result, we are forced to read it in order to obtain a good grade; however, ""Red Dragon"" is a book you'll WANT to finish...I couldn't put it down!One problemmatic feature in this book is its legalese -- it is deeply rooted in justice terminology which might hinder some novice readers looking for a light, quick read. Steer clear of this book if that is what you seek.However, if you are looking for a book that, although it is dated nearly two decades ago, still pertains to todays criminal justice system, do read it. Not only is it entertaining, it is also very informative. Nicely done, Mr. Harris."
4,"Gripping, Scary Murder thriller","I wanted to read about Hannibal Lector after watching ""Silence of the Lambs"" and had more than I bargained for. This is a really scary book, I couldn't stop reading the minute I picked it up and finished it in 1 sitting. There are at least a few monsters in this story, we have the ""hero"" Will Graham and the monster on the killing spree and of course Dr Hannibal Lector pulling some strings behind bars. The storyline is well developed and the characters are incrediblely vivid, almost can visualise them.... scary thought that monsters can be created from such sad background.. Get some coffee and biscuits, you won't put down the book till you're done."
5,tick b gone,Best tick remover on market. I am an outdoorsmen and have gotten pleanty of use out of this product. Buy it you never know when you might use it.
4,Good niche product,"You can't argue with the funky design of this case: it's a real attention-getter. It's limited by 2 things: 1) you can't use the laptop while it's in the case; 2) it's a bit thicker/bigger than a laptop sleeve.I use the case as protection and I have to say it's performing wonderfully. Good construction, quality, and durability. For my own purposes, I would give this 5 stars but I gave it 4 because other users may find the 2 limitations that I mention, well, limiting.As an aside, if you can get your hands on one of Speck's ""Specktone"" ipod dock/speaker systems, do it. Great sound and, again, funky retro design. try ebay"
4,Norman gets back to his best,"With Blood Brothers the series returns (albeit briefly) to something like the quality of the first few. Basically it seems that fans of Gor either like the first 12 or so books (maybe excluding Captive #7) because they like the wonderful descriptive writing, the clever plotting and the general excitement of the series; or they like the later books that focus much more on the SM motif. Blood Brothers is clearly one of the former and well worth reading if you have wearied of Norman's sexual fantasies and are keen to get back to the Tarl Cabot saga."
4,"Very compact, good performance","This lantern is very compact and quite durable. The burn time is excellent, several hours (4-5) on one canister. The only negative thing is the brightness is slightly less than a traditional silk-mantle lantern. I would say it's about the equivelant brightness of a 30-watt light bulb."
2,mom of 2,"The Cul-de-sac Kids Books 1-6 (Boxed Set)I was so excited to find christian based chapter books for my third-grader - especially with all the positive reviews, however I did not expect my child to be reading about Attention Deficit. One of the characters, Jason Birchall, has Attention Deficit and there are many references to ""his pills."" Book #4 ""No Grown-ups Allowed"" deals with this subject. While this is a growing problem among children, it was not something I was prepared for and didn't feel it was appropriate for my child at this stage in his life. Book #5, ""Frog Power,"" references divorce - also something else I wasn't expecting. I didn't think I would need to worry about giving my child these books, but I guess you should always be on guard as to what you allow into your child's life."
5,The Cul-de-Sac Kids are great!,I gave the first 6 book set to my granddaughter for Christmas and she finished the first two books in a week and loves them! I got her two more sets for her upcoming birthday!
4,Good books for kids -Accelerated Reader,"These books must have been on back order because it took awhile to get, but my 8 and 5 year old LOVE them. My second grader brought them to school and the librarian ended up ordering the series. The Christian values in the stories are solid."
1,sickening! ZERO STARS,"Why don't we make movies for every other news channel about their liberal agendas? It's amazing how this movie is put out when there is one conservative network. All the rest are liberal. None of you have any idea what your talking about. Take a step back and look at yourselves. This is just a tool of the liberal media to try to ruin fox news. Almost every paper is liberal and almost every news channel is liberal. 99% of the media is biased in one direction. It's sickening! And they want to acheive a one sided media slant. It's communist. Not everyone is a democrat. This country is split right down the middle. That's the way it should be represented in the media, and it's not even close, which is wrong."
3,"Quality build, reliable, but NOISY","This is an excellent CAT-6 switch. It works perfectly, easy setup, strong and good construction. My only complaint is that the fans are LOUD... and BOY ARE THEY LOUD!!! How much cooling does a switch need? I mean, it's just a switch; it's not a server... sheesh! This is the LOUDEST item in my rack... louder than all my other servers... is that nuts or what!?!?! So, if noise is an issue (even slightly), do NOT get this! If noise isn't an issue at all, then I recommend it."
4,Great Switch,We have this switch for over 3 years and it works great. Easy setup and it's a name you can trust.
1,Too Small,"I bought the twine dispenser and the twine it offered. to buy together, would not fit unless you unrolled half of the twine and put it in the dispenser. Also the rubber gasket where the twine comes out of the dispenser keeps popping out"
1,BEWARE THE RETURN POLICY!,"I received this item as a gift from a friend. The dispenser itself is fine, but I already own one and wanted to return it to Chefs Catalog or to exchange it. The price in their catalog was $10.99 and they were willing to accept it in return, but there is a $10.50 RESTOCKING FEE that I would have to pay! This fee is the same regardless of the original price of the item purchased. Of course this means that I would be returning it for a grand total of $0.49! When I talked to Diane in their ""Customer Service"" department about this, she told me that the restocking fee cannot be waived and that her suggestion was...get this...""Maybe you can give it to someone else"". Unbelievable."
1,Lid Won't Come Off,"I didn't know about the replacement balls of string being too big, but that's not the problem I have with this item. I can't get the lid off.You need to do that so you can feed the end of the string through the hole. The stainless steel lid is wedged onto the stainless steel can and will not yield. It won't be pulled off, screwed off, or, so far, even pried of. I'll get the lid off somehow, but not without severely scratching the container."
3,A nice read,"This was a good book, not a great one. The final scene on the boat involving David was a little far fetched, and I would have liked to have known more about the characters of Cardoza and Geary, but there was enough suspense in the book to keep me interested until the end. A nice, intriguing book to read."
4,Five Days in Summer,Great read. Loved the characters. Loved it from start to finsh.Couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read another Katia Lee book.
4,Nice read..I read it in one night,"This was the first book I had ever read from this author. By the title you would almost think it was a light summer romance. Well, you would be mistaken..it starts from the first chapter as a gripping, heartpounding suspense and a race to find Emily in five days. I really liked the characters and could relate to them. I loved the retired FBI guy, Geary, he was great! If I was ever in this situation, I would definitely want him on my side. I thought it was so sweet how much in love Will was with his wife and how he wanted to stop at nothing to find her. I found myself more than once biting my nails nervously as the countdown of the 5 days grew to a close. The ending was exciting, I think the book was well developed. This author has talent, I look forward to reading more of her work."
2,What a waste!,"This book has exactly 304 pages, if you take away everything that doesn't has to do anything with the main story like how well can swim the kids in the sea, the illness of the baby, the family who found Emily's bracelet, the new house they wanted to buy, etc. The book could be written in less than 200 pages, and if you think that an eleven years kid can win a battle to a cop whom loves to kill is just pathetic."
3,Enjoyable.,"This was an enjoyable read. I wish her books were a little longer since it goes so fast. I enjoyed this book, thought it was suspenseful and kept me reading so that I finished it in a day. If you enjoy suspense, you will enjoy this for a quick read."
1,alas...,"Alas... I read the first book... liked it. So, I ordered all her books... and they are just the same as the first. Just the names are changed. Maybe if I hadn't read a couple back to back I would have had a different experience. Maybe... 10 years apart."
2,One of Feehan's worst yet...,"Although I love C.Feehan's work, this book, left me with a sour after taste. from the beginning of the book, I just couldn't get into it. The characters and plot didn't mesh well with the other books Feehan's published. It seems that when she writes about the brothers her books suck. Dark Secret was also one of her worse written books. I will continue to read Feehan, but I hope that she'll think about her readers reactions before publishing something for the sake of being published"
4,Good holiday book,"If you like Christine feehan, and holiday books then I would buy this one. This book updates you on all past characters and introduces some new ones. I particularly enjoyed the moments with skylar."
3,"OK, I read it.",It's a fair story. (My favorites of the series are Dark Demon and Dark Desire).Since it's a reunion book it was nice to find out what is going on in the lives of the past characters and it had a nearly engaging story.However I have determined what has been bugging me about the DARK series AND this is why I can only give it at most 3 stars. The Heroes are the same and the Heroines are the same - in everything except for appearance (except possible Natalya and Shea - although she is pretty much blended into the other female characters). It seems like these characters can be used interchangeably.Even the situations were redundant throughout this novel.The highlight of the story was Santa.
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"After the disappointment of Dark Demon, Dark Celebration was a wonderful, wonderful read. It kept my rapt attention all the way through. It was delightful that Ms. Feehan gave us little inside stories involving all of the wonderful characters we have come to love in her books, and an insight into many more books that she can write in the future involving many of the characters. The pregnancies of several of the couples and their happines brought tears to my eyes, and the soon to be brought together couples such as Skyler and Dimitri, MaryAnn and Manolito, gives us something wonderful to look forward to. Kudos on this writing, and it leaves me hope for many, many more wonderful books from Ms. Feehan."
3,Good reunion.,This book brings together all the carpathians from the previous books. Good to catch up on what they are all doing. This book is mainly about trying to figure out the problem of the dying Carpathian race.
5,Great Reading,As always Christine Feehan is great. Will continue to read all of the Carpathians Series and may start others series
5,Dark Celebration By Christine Feehan,A worthy Dark sultry totaly orgazmatic Read Feehan has definatly found the paranormal G spot! All of Feehan's Dark books are predictable men HOT make women Hotter But reader is in for a great escape with these hotties.
5,Dark Celebration: A Carpathian Reunion,"I loved this book, it was great to catch up with all of the Carpathians and find out how they are all doing. Please keep up the good work and write more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Dark Celebration,Great book and a way to check up on all the other characters this author wrote about. It tells one story and continues the series by telling how all the other couples are getting along and whats going on with them.
4,Good Reunion,"The book is pretty much a quick reunion for all the characters and storylines developed in previous books. It also sets up a few new storylines that will hopefully play out in books to come. If you're looking for an in-depth story about a single couple, this isn't it. If you just want to catch up with all your favorite couples from previous books and get excited about new developments, this is a must-have."
4,Nice interweaving of characters,"I would say it was not my favorite Christine Feehan novel. I love the dark hunters series more...The carpathian series is very romantic in general and always have happy endings.So, its a very good book, just not up to her normal par in my opinion."
5,Dark Series Reader,"excellent author, excellent book. If you like the Dark books you will love this. Humor, romance, sex, teaser moments for future books.A must read for the Feehan fan.kristin d."
2,Huge Disappointment,"This was a huge disappointment to me.I can sum it up in one word - filler.This is nothing but many of her stories told over again with a small sub story and filler filler filler.Unless you buy her books to make sure you have the entire collection, you can leave this one off of your list."
3,Where to start.......,"I have read almost every book Christine Feehan has written. The Dark Series are my favorites. The Jaguar books are my least favorites. This book features most of her past characters - understandable, as it is a ""Reunion"". Honestly though, I was almost expecting to see a Drake sister or two stroll in.I do appreciate the author's efforts to write a book specifically for her fans who probably inundate her with requests to know ""what's happening"" with their favorite couple(s). But this book left me with more questions than answers. And the ending was too abrupt. Good promo for future books though.I will end this review by saying that I gave 3 stars for the author's time and effort, but for content, I would give it only 1 or 2. I like feeling satisfied at the conclusion of any book, and I was not with this one."
3,To Be Continued,"I love reading Feehan's books and have them all, including this one, unfortunately. There is one particularly amusing and well-wrought scene; however, this so-called novel is one of those ""to be continued"" episodes that I wish I'd been warned about before buying. I was disappointed that this is mainly an introduction to the next two Dark Series couples instead of a complete novel about them. I especially look forward to reading Marianne and Manolito's story, so I'm not quitting Feehan over this. Still, I advise avid romance readers to save their money for the next two books in the series. Caveat emptor."
3,DarkCelebration: A Carpathian Reunion,"Love these books. Eagerly await the next.This one however, left me wanting....a real story. The players were all there but, it seemed hurried and not fleshed out.It seemed the story suffered in an effort to bind all the players into it. The ultimate cast of players not supported by a strong enough platform. None the less when's the next one due?"
4,Great update on the Dark Series!,"I adore Feehan's whole Dark series and was excited to get this new book as it came out. It was great to catch up on all the couples, and gives a way to segue into the South American family. Definitely should read series in order before you read this book, though, or you won't really understand it."
4,quick delivery,"Book came quickly and even though I ordered the used copy the pages are without creases and only the cover has minor 'rub' marks, overall well worth the $9 I paid for it."
5,I sat and read it the wole day and finished it,It was a great book as always she is obviously leaving things open for more books. I hope there is a continuation of Skyler and Demitri. And of coarse something on Dominque. The book is great she has most couples in it and it is funny and a great read.
2,Cheap Head Phones!,"Cheap inexspensive headphones. No Bass what so ever.The head band is quite narrow, just the right size for a kid.I am very Dissapointed in the quality."
2,Doesn't work in the car,"I bought this for my car. It works fine outside the car, but interference in the car makes it go haywire. Not its fault. I should have known this would happen. I recommend it for other uses."
2,"not reliable, basicly a peice of junk","Since I have opened it the temp reading is 5% higher than all my other thermomaters. have not put in car yet.mainly got for temp readings. If it only stays 5% higher , it will be okThought it would be biggerThis item would make a great gag gift, for the person who is hot blooded and always getting lost.got temp ajusted to work, but compass changes if you put anywhere near any metal in carput on dash, and it gets cooked by the sunall in all, save your money and by a real one"
4,Great for the price - but gets messed up in the car,"Something in our console makes the needle point the wrong way, otherwise we love this little thing. Has a little velcro/reattachable sticker and a hinge these two in combination let you adjust the angle to wherever you would be looking at it from. We can pick it up and hold in the air and needle seems to point to North then."
1,it is useless,"the thermometer usually works, but the temperature reading in a car highly depends on where you put the thermometer. for example near the window , air con. or not. under sun or not.Then the compass is useless, because it always point to west.So basically this item is useless."
3,Good nostalgic book,"Okay so apparently I loved this book growing up, but I can't imagine why now. Except that I had a grandmother who wrote me often and I loved her letters. However, it is very dull for a child nowadays, as my son won't sit still and just doesn't like it. I have to say I am bored with it too...Good for nostalgia, not good for kids today."
3,"Premise was good, but just didn't deliver","The idea that we have become an uncivil society is correct. Trying to stimulate young minds to reflect on civility is also a good idea, but this book, overpriced and better suited for fund raising for local boyscout troops just didn't hit home, even with my own 13 year old son. It was more like one of those self-publishing recipe books local groups publish to sell for fund raising. The rules of George Washington really don't even often deal with larger issues of morality, but more like good table manners or conversation ethics. The best part of the book in my opinion was the illustrations which depicted George as a young boyscout type setting a good example of each rule, along side a misbehaving modern lad. The efforts of modern day boyscouts to grapple with the idea of civility is a worthwhile activity, but didn't really provide good reading material in this case."
1,not as pictured,"The clamp that is pictured in the listing exerts vertical pressure when the handle is in the horizontal position. The clamp(s) I received exert horizontal pressure when the handle is in the horizontal position.And, this vendor offers only to replace the ordered item with the ordered item - no exchanges or refunds.The clamps themselves seem fine. They are just not the clamps that are pictured in the listing.MSI-PRO 225-D 51120 Horizontal Quick-Release Toggle Clamps"
4,Solid hardware,"I picked up a couple of these to incorporate as hold-downs on a table saw sled I built. They are working very well for the task and just have them attached using #8 x 3/4"" wood screws. The holes on the base are two large to use #6 screws (just an FYI). There are multiple points of adjustment on these so they offer quite a bit of flexibility. They do tend to be a little stiff out of the box, but I suspect they will loosen up a little with some lubrication and use. So if you need a couple of toggle clamps for a saw sled and are intimidated by the multitude of options from a place like McMaster-Carr, just get a couple of these. They are flexible enough to meet most needs."
5,fgaribx,"This product works excellently, I recommend it, I have been very helpful, especially if you have extra hands these pieces will help them."
5,Secure Holding Power,I made a coping sled for routing cabinet door rails. It is exceptionally well made and holds securely. MSI products are high quality and I can honestly recommend this to you.
5,Very handy,"This hold down clamp is great and comes in handy when you need to keep something in place, and your hands out of the way. It is easily installed and the clamping force is enough to keep things where you want them. It's actually heavier than I thought, so it is definitely well made."
4,Nice Clamp,"These clamps work well on my shop-made jigs. I had no problem with the design of the clamp and attaching it to the jig. One might need to think outside the box and put the nut down first then insert the screw, I had no problem using a flat rubbing washer plus a lock washer plus a standard nut, where's the problem?When selecting these clamps there are a few styles to choose from, this vertical design might not be the best if there are vertical clearance issues then get the horizontal ones, I have both kinds and both work equally well just decide if a handle sticking up or sticking out will be in your way and go from there. Taking the time to make a hold-down jig is well worth the effort, you will actually use it as opposed to hand clamping every time, and the safety of working on restrained objects is unquestioned."
3,"Unique and cutting-edge for its time, but buggy","Half-Life 2 in the single player mode was way too short. The number of weapons was limited, and I had been spoiled by other FPS's to have at least a semi-automatic sniper rifle and a sub-machinegun or carbine that could hit the broadside of a barn. The HK MP-7 SMG was pathetic in this game. The accuracy was mediocre and the damage was extremely limited. In terms of gameplay, HL2 gets 5/5 from me. However, it kept crashing every so often on my gaming rig to the point that I stopped playing the game for over a month until I just wanted to get it off my desk.I do not like Steam and it appears that it has never even asked for my DVD. The first time I installed the game, it decided to just download the entire game off Steam even though I had a nice shiny DVD in the drive.Overall, the game gets 3/5 from me for some bugs, unimaginative arsenal (except for the gravity gun, which is extremely fun), and Steam."
1,The game is good but I wouldn't buy it again...,"...I bought it sometime ago and was annoyed to find I needed an internet connection to install it...while I finally got it back out I went through the ""Steam"" nonsense but found I still needed to enter the registration code which is on the pamphlet but NOT on the box and NOT on the CD...well, the pamphlet had managed to escape the box and, after spending an hour looking for it, I gave up...so I took a simpler route and went online to a ""warez"" site and downloaded a steam-free, code installation-free hacked copy which worked fine...I must say the the game is pretty decent -- better than ""Quake"" but not as good as ""Far Cry""...regardless, I'm not paying money for another ""steam"" game."
1,Perfect.....oh no here comes STEAM...HORRIBLE,"This could be a Terrific game,if there was no STEAM activation WDF..thereare many companies that invest millions in software and they don't getyou through Damn Sh... activation thing.PERIOD."
3,Did not provide access to game. No activation code.,Simply put it was a waste of money. Can't access the game to play it. Had to go through Steam to get it.
1,It's a shame,"The installation process is really hard even if you have a decent Internet Conection, so much troubles for a game! Don get this wrong, its a very very good and intelligent game, even better than others recently release, but what it's the meaning of buying a DVD disc if you have to download the game from a server on the internet..thats make no sense. It's a shame !"
1,Steam still sucks,"Played this when it first came out and decided pay it again-dealing with Steam is preventing me from playing the game just like last time,it took days to get a response.Back in the basement with this game I will never buy a product that has anything to do with Steam"
1,Don't get burned by STEAM,I don't know how great this game is. I get halted by steam because I bought a used game. According to VALVE used games are INVALID.AMAZON PLEASE PULL ALL USED SALES. They will not work.
2,Steam killed this game for me.,I will never buy a valve product ever again. To play this game you have to let steam take over your computer. This is a singleplayer game also. And i got to play it twice in a week only because steam was having problems with logins. Never again.
1,Protection scheme makes it unplayable,"You MUST have an Internet connection to play. If anybody got hold of your CD key number before you, you will never be able to play the game, and Valve will NOT help you if you bought the game on eBay. I never thought I'd say this, but Valve is worse than Microsoft."
1,REGISTRATION NIGHTMARE,"I spent hours,...hours trying to acivate this game, shutting of software, virus control, firewalls deleting programs, all to no avail. could not activate the game. What a drag, I keep reading that the game is great, but this corporate, headless, inconsiderate, inhuman, non responsive entity wont let me play the game. so the game is probably good if you could activate, but good luck if you buy a used game. Beware if you buy a used game .The first owners have probably pirated the game and you are going to be stuck with a inoperable piece of software. Good luck!"
4,What a Game!,"Half-Life II is a great game! The graphisc are outstanding and the controls are easy to learn. The game developers have done a great job mixing it up the story line and subsequent challenges for Gordon Freeman.I'm not a hard core gamer, but I certainly find HL2 very intertaining."
1,Steam was buggy,"To play this game, you have to logon to Steam, valve's online download system. Its buggy, difficult to configure, and crashes. If you can't get it to work, you don't get to play, which is where I am. I really wish I hadn't bought this game. So far, its money completely wasted. Do not buy this game, unless you enjoy configuring your router, firewall, etc.update : Jan 2011: Steam has matured a great deal in 3 years, and works much better. Using the same computer (I upgraded the video card). last August I downloaded FEAR and played it just fine."
2,Major pain,"Bought the game a few years ago and it was a blast. Well a few email address changes later and a couple of system rebuilds, I decide to install the game again and play it. But lo and behold, Steam is there asking for forgotten information. And even if the information wasn't forgotten completely, access to old email accounts doesn't work. So here I sit, with my purchased game, including the cd key, and I am unable to play this game.I see no reason why any company has to put such extreme measures on controlling access to a game with little to no way of recovering necessary information necessary to play it. Bah"
5,still a great game,It was cheaper here then on steam a while back. now its supper cheap on steam.Spent hours on this before I was married now... not so much...
1,Class action lawsuit warranted,"I am seriously thinking about referring this issue to a group of lawyer friends. I am in the technology profession, and I've spent hours trying to get this game to run. And it looks like I am not the only one. Of course, we can't get a refund. How can any company think it's ok when so many folks are unable to use their product, offer little in the way of support, and won't give a refund. Unbelievable..."
5,Absolutely great!!!,"One of the two best FPS I've played. It's right up there with Bioshock. It has everything, and I compare every game I play now to it."
4,It's Half Life 2!!,"One of the best games to come out for it's time, and still has plenty mods and total conversions being made for it. Heck I was playing a beta of a total conversion that made it like Stargate, and another like Pirates..."
2,I'm sure it's a great game.,"But after spending about 12 hours trying to get my computer to run it I'm pretty sure HL2 will gather dust on one of my shelves. Even after folowing the paper and website directions, I could not get my computer to even run the disk. Steams website runs you all over the place with download links that don't work or are linked to nothing. I understand that Valve is trying to prevent piracy, but it should not be this difficult to get a brand new game to work. I had an easier time helping a friend put together an ultra-light airplane kit than trying to get HL2 to run. Here's my advice for anyone thinking of buying HL21. Be willing to spend hours at Steams website configuring your computer to run HL2.2. Make sure you will not be too upset about blowing $20 on a game you may never play.The people at Valve had to be aware that they were releasing a game that many of their customers would never be able to play because of all the technical problems. Shame on you guys!"
5,Body by Trimester,"Joys postnatal workouts have provided me with no excuses to workout. Even as a mother of three children under the age of four. These quick, easy and high calorie burning workouts can be squeezed in any time of day. I especially enjoy the mommy & me workout and get to engage all my children in it, while getting a great workout. You will not be disappointed with this DVD. I look forward to joys upbeat workouts for years to come and remaining a fit and active mom."
5,Altamente recomendado,"Le regalé este libro a mi esposa y le encanto. Lo que mas me gusta es que son reflexiones de un tamaño perfecto. Ni tan cortas que no te digan mucho, ni tan largas que evites leerlas por falta de tiempo. Excelente recurso para comenzar el día con una lectura espiritual que te ayude a enfocarte durante el día."
5,Making life easier to live...,"It was an incredible experience to read into the world of Marcia Ford. I found myself unable to put it down, thinking, what could possible happen to her next!? She has been through so many hardships, most that she can look at now with a humor that makes life seem easier to live. I myself am still searching for that home that is so frequently spoken of in this book. I learned so much from her life, and thanked God that I didn't have to learn it the hard way like she did. Her strength encouraged me a great deal. The day I finished I let a friend borrow it. It is the kind of story that HAS to be shared because different people will gain differently from it."
3,50ft subwoofer cable,"I have read reviews about this cable, most people rated 5 stars. I need a long cable for my Polk Audio subwoofer, and I found this one. I bought it and I installed it. The cable suppose to help create or produce a clean good sound, but instead it created a humming kind of sound every time the subwoofer is on. I would not recommend this cable."
2,Failed after a few months,"In the beginning this cable was fine, but a few months later it simply stopped carrying signal. I don't know if it is a cold solder somewhere or a weak wire section that broke, but it's not like the thing was being abused or even moved around...it just failed."
1,Poor Performance,The product was purchased to be used as connection for my primary sub. The sub is powered which means it should shut off automatically when no signal is detected. The insulation of this wire is not sufficient to protect from interference. The sub unit will not turn off even when this wire was disconnected from my receiver. Do not buy.
2,"Buy the Cable From Monoprice, Not an Amazon Third Party Vendor","Monoprice has been known for their quality, beefy cables that always work perfectly. When I saw the brand name ""Monoprice"" on this listing, I went ahead and purchased it from one of the third party vendors. I expected a nice, beefy cable, but what i received obviously wasn't a Monoprice product. The cable was extremely thin. I mean, it's about as thick as half a stand of speaker cable, or less.I tried it out anyways, and was not surprised when the cable introduced a very noticeable hum to my subwoofer. I ordered a cable from ""Mediabridge"" instead. The cable was much beefier and caused no hum to my subwoofer.The vendor I purchased it from made me pay return shipping to get a refund, despite being misleading in their photo. I was shocked when I got it in the mail and a 50 foot cable could fit in a 4x4 pack.I would give it a 1, but I respect Monoprice too much. I'm sure if this was actually their product, it would have worked great."
2,Not as shown.,"Please impute a picture that shows the actual product you are selling. The cable I received had significantly less insulation than depicted. The wire was so poorly insulated it created a hum in the subwoofer. I replaced it with a better quality cable and hum ceased. You get what you pay for. Unless you are satisfied listening to your sub hum and poor quality sound come out of it, buy better quality."
2,Save Your Money,This lightweight poorly constructed cable is so so at best. Lots of signal loss and doesn't shield EMI/RF very well. Picks up stray electrical pulses pretty easily. Also had to crimp the RCA connectors to keep them in place. Spring for a few extra bucks and get a decent cable. You get what you pay for.
5,More than enough cable,"Everything as advertised. I have this cable hooked up to my subwoofer stretching from my media closet, through the attic, down the wall, and to my subwoofer. Material used appears to be good quality."
2,Buyer Beware,"The Gearwrench torque wrench does seem to work well out of the box. The ratcheting mechanism is not very smooth and the forward/reverse lever feels like it could fall off at any minute. FURTHER, and the reason I am returning the product is because the webpage advertises that this item has a LIFETIME warranty. It does NOT. It has a one year limited warranty and you can pay for all shipping expenses if there is a problem. FALSELY ADVERTISED."
4,review,I thought the book was good and that it deals with the world as it stands today society and that I think young ladies shouldn't get preagant when they are young and wait till they really love some and they want to stay with them forever
3,Me haces falta,I found this groups music to be very romantic and worthy of being regarded as date music. The ballads are very danceable and heartwarming at the same time.
2,So annoying,"He doesn't really dance, he jumps up and down. It is very loud and noisy when jumping and we just found it annoying. Our 5 year old loved it."
2,Limp Lamp,"These lamps were expensive, and quite frankly, disappointing. I ordered two, as bed side lamps, but both of them lean a little to one side, and this doesnt appear to be fixable. The bulbs that come with the lamps provide very little light, so they had to be replaced for stronger bulbs.Find a better lamp than this."
1,wireless transmitter charging cradle,The product never worked right. I would have sent it back but I threw away the box. Very disappointed.I would not recommend purchasing this product.
5,descent into darkness,what a great book! i couldn't put it down. commander raymer and the men working with him were brave heroes.this book gives a glimpse of life in hawaii in the early forties as well as the navy's diving program in its infancy.not to mention the unique problems of salvaging the ships that were damaged in the pearl harbor attack.i highly recommend this book.
5,Account of Diving,This book reminds me of my father's stories in the Navy during the same time period. I highly recommend it for the content and the tense descriptions of diving after the disaster that was the attack on Pearl Harbor.
4,Outstanding,"This is a well written account of a unique experience.The author shares the experience of working under water, inside pitch-black battleships.The work to salvage many of the ships attacked and sunk on December 7, 1941 is a largely untold story.Fascinating!"
3,pave cz skull and crossbones bracelet,"its ok, the the skulls and crossbones are smallllll and the bracelet is so petit, pretty but too delicate for a bracelet"
2,Cone of Dead Air,"I was looking for a ceiling mounted fan for my home gym to blow air on me when I'm running on the treadmill. I mounted this 12"" fan approx 8 feet from where I would be positioned on the treadmill. While there is some air movement, it is very dispersed from an 8 foot distance. There seems to be a large ""cone of dead air"" meaning that the motor cover on the front of the fan is so larges relative to the blades that there is a big ""hole"" of dead air right in the middle. I tried moving the fan in different directions, but the dead zone is just too large to make any difference at 8 feet. I am returning for the larger 14"" model."
3,Average fan,"Fan circulates well, and is exceptionally quiet on low speed. I mounted mine on a ceiling at a angle and after 2 months the bearings show signs of wear and fan has become louder. May not be able to with stand my usage needs which is only 4-5 times a week while I have the wood stove going in the shop."
3,ok fan,"Fan seems to be of acceptable quality. Dose not seems to move as much air as it should. Will try a larger size (18"") next time."
3,No fittings!,"I would have liked this a lot better if it had come with the lag screw and washers they want you to use. They sent some cable, apparently they want you to use that some how. Also if you hang it, so the pull switch is hanging the right way the handle is in the way of the bracket. It may be a great fan, but it isn't that easy to install considering how much air it will be moving."
1,Fails to live up to cartoon connection,"When I first heard that the man who had provided the model for the Jon Lovitz character on the criminally neglected cartoon series 'The Critic' had an autobiography out I was understandably excited. Sad to say, this latest entry in the memoir sweepstakes is a grave disappointment. A homely collection of borrowed postmod effects, graceless prose and anecdotes so boring that one begins to suspect the author of a passive-aggressive hostility. Alas, no matter how funny he may look, Luc Sante's no Jon Lovitz."
2,Great Movie -- Poorly copied,"Having seen this movie as a kid, and LOVED it, I was ready to show it to my Grandkids. Bought the DVD and went to watch it myself first to see if I remembered it. Big disappointment. The quality of the movie is so poor that I didn't finish watching it. Didn't show it to the Grandkids. It was just too grainy and hard to look at. What are they thinking? Disney did a wonderful job creating the film. Why make such a poor DVD of it? I don't understand it. So, there it sits, unwatched. Very sad. I rated this 2 stars because I loved the movie. But the quality shouldn't get any stars at all. Shame on you, Disney. Your loyal customers deserve better. You are the conglomerate you are now because of your customers. Please don't short change the people who made you who you are today."
4,I love this movie,"This DVD comes with four cartoons. The first being The Reluctant Dragon, which is by far the best. I really do love the cartoon, it is super clever and fun."
4,Classic shorts still appropriate for children today,I grew up watching the shorts on this DVD. My child received this as a gift and is very happy with it.
4,Second book in the series: Simon Jones is always great!,The narrator (Simon Jones) is always superb. The first book in this trilogy was superb. The Chase is the second and it is very good. The Truth (the third book) slips a bit more. My rating is for the second book! There was a bit too much political messaging in it for my taste. But this audio book is still a joy.
5,"More Enemies, More Point of Views","A few more enemies and the police are after Charlie and his friends. Charlie and company hide out in an king's castle in Venice. However, it seems that an ally is betraying them. And the journey to Africa continues...It always impresses me when an author manages to show the bad guys' point of view as reasonably as the good guys'. These authors prove to be stars at this."
1,broke before it was used once...,"this radio is one of the worst terrible radios out of all of coby's crap, and this is just pathetic, you know coby, the worst and cheapest you can brand buy, don't get this."
4,uh,"For the price, this is a good item. You get what you pay for. I am having issues with the ear buds where they plug into the unit. I have to twist the wire to not get scratchy noises."
1,wrong item,"I received the wrong item. I have a Sony camera that requires rechargeable AA batteries. The charger I received was for a single, flat battery. May I return it?"
5,stunning collection,"If you can find a better cover of Carly Simon's That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be you must be in Heaven. This entire collection is terrific from beginning to end, but sometimes, just sometimes, an artist's talent uncovers the heart and soul of a well-known song....and creates magic."
4,Fun and informative,My kids loved this book and my husband and I both learned a lot too. It's hard to find simple activities that are filled with so much meaning at Christmas time - glad we have this!
2,Not what I was looking for,"I own Helen Haidle's THE REAL 12 DAYS OF CHIRSTMAS and I wanted a children's Christian Activity book to enhance the learning experience.My first disappointment with this Activity book is that there are actual""activities"" (other than coloring)for only 5 of the 12 days.Because of the Catholic perspective that is presented and the lack of Scriptural foundation this book does not meet the need I had."
2,arrogance exemplefied,"This book typifies this author's arrogance. It seems to me that he is so self-centered that he can not write about things in a the broad context of life, without including his own narrow perspective. A glorified autobiography!"
3,"Midnight Love, Marvin Gaye",Bought it because I wanted Sexual Healing. Dated songs but pleasant to listen to and for the most part the other songs are growing on me.
5,Outstanding reference book,This is a reference book that is a necessity if you are a store card collector. Easily arranged for quick identification and valuation. I highly recommend it.
5,It's AMAZING,"This new record is fantastic...The songs seem to flow & Bill Pitcock IV is rockin'Sparko Tulsa, OK"
2,Exasperating and annoying,"As a longtime reader of metaphysical, religious, and New Age materials, I was extremely disappointed in this book. Overwrought, overly dramatic (even if, as the author states, it is truthful), and agonizingly lengthy are some likely reasons why Ms. Maxey couldn't find a publisher. The message seemed to be about how special she was in having her visions and kundalini-like phenomena. I do think her intent was to indicate that ""ascension"", or merging with Christ Consciousness, is available to all, but because of the writing style and too detailed and overly emphasized descriptions of the author's ecstatic states, the message was garbled. In short, I had to slog my way through this work and cannot recommend it."
3,"""I want your lovin..""","""..I want your revenge.."" THIS is how I feel when listening to thE Pussy Opus..with punk AND Ac/Dc type solos..(""OOH LA LA"" I feel GaGA when listening..)""Dance and Myth:part 1-the solo dances"" can not compare in terms of sneering,creative in your face solos and wise choice songs.."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"This fudge is too sweet, too dense, and I have never heard of maple fudge without walnuts or any other kind of nuts. But it arrived packed well, and it was fresh."
2,B-complete,Just switched to this brand. Not crazy about it. I don't feel any difference in regard to feeling calmer or more relaxed. I'll switch next time I have to order.
5,About the freudian cover-up,"Jeffrey Massons ""Assault on Truth"" is probably one of the most important books of the 20th century. He shows in detail how Freud betrayed his female patients and how he finally ended up in denying the evidence of the widespread existence of child sexual abuse. Massons book is a forceful attack against the freudian movement, who even today build their whole theory about child sexuality and the oedipus complex on Freuds betrayal in 1897. But it is also a good refutation of these witness psychologists who today falsely claims that Freud implanted false memories of sexual abuse in his patients. For everyone interested in topics such as the foundation of psychoanalysis or the debate about child sexual abuse - just read it!"
2,revolutionary? NOT,"Masson, who has the virtue of at least being honest in his views, has been refuted so many time by so many scholars from different circles, that I find it strange that some still think his thesis revolutionary. Ignorance of relevant literature certainly makes one vulnerable to Masson's own assault on truth. For a brief yet exhaustive account of the history Masson mentions the reader may consult G. Izenberg's essay in The Combridge Companion to Freud. Another helpful book--which exposed Masson so much that he sued its author, and lost--is In the Freud Archives by Janet Malcom."
5,Is 5 stars all I can give it?,"I purchased this disc the day it came out and in the years since, NOTHING has received more play on my stereo! The song selection is a great retrospective of the various eras of Little Feat's career. The sound quality is excellent. Best yet, the listener comes away awed by the raw talent of each of the individual musicians.One interesting bit of trivia about this album: The band got the title from a suggestion of a fan. If you're a Little Feat fan, buy this album now before it's out of print!"
2,Dissappointed,"I don't know, maybe I it's me, but this isn't close to other albums I have of Little Feat. The voices on this one were weak. At least I bought it used. Stick with Waiting for Columbus."
5,Best Feat since Columbus,Having seen a couple of mediocre Feat concerts (as well as a great one) I was dubious. They put on a good show at Jazz Fest though and the reviews here were all 5 star so I decided to give it a try. Wow. They are incredibly tight and the horn section adds a lot. Very close to Waiting for Columbus in quality and I don't think there's a better live album than that.
1,Super small truck - picture makes it look bigger than it is!,"I obviously didn't read the dimensions very well with this product because it is very small. Also you have to put it together. So imagine, small little pieces of plastic to put together and then you have a very small little truck that is easily breakable by your child. This would be for children that are 10 or above. I sent mine back because of the factors stated above. I would not recommend this toy - really not even for an older child."
2,Model Army Truck,"I erred when I purchased this item, thinking it was something that could be played with by at 4-year-old. It is really a model. We returned it for that reason."
4,Powerful clamp,"I've been using these for occasional use around the house for 3-4 years now, and they still work well.Very powerful clamp when you need it, but not appropriate for delicate work- It'll damage light woods (e.g. balsa)."
1,"Yeah, right, whatever","The book is a typical anti-rock rant from folks who are so obsessed with what they think God thinks about every little thing that they left their sense of humor & proportion back in the dust. Though their ""top ten list of most wanted offenders"" (aka ""Our Top Ten List of Folks To Harass Until They Believe What We Want Them To Believe"") is most unintentionally funny and very outdated, even at the time the book was in print. With all the major problems facing us today, it's somehow refreshing to see people who are still so small-minded...stay focused on Rock, guys. It'll keep you out of the real problems!"
4,Very best of Tommy Cash,"This CD is great for Johnny Cash fans. Tommy Cash almost sounds like big brother Johnny. The difference is interesting, and Tommy has a better voice then big brother. I wonder what Tommys career would have been, if there was NO Johnny Cash."
3,Tiiiiiiiiiin Roof.......Rusty,"I traded my uncle a couple of sweaters for this Cd, which is usually not a good idea because he really likes to rip me off. One time, I traded him a pair of Air Jordans for Kid Rock - yuck! My foot was really in my mouth then. NOT THIS TIME THOUGH! What a great TECHNO CD...yeah, that's right, TECHNO. Enough of the trance man, that's all GU does. I like this cuz its....funky. Say it three times: funky fresh..funky,funky fresh...etc. It does start off a little slow but it's okay because it really picks up in the end. It's a journey. I wouldn't say mystical, but its damn good. WATCH OUT VAN DYKE, the Emerson chuck wagon is a rollin through your town. Check out the Soul Grabber song, it will make you move to the beat. Move to the beat, get funky, move to the beat, watch it now, watch it now...etc. Peace, love, and dance...not France."
2,Lacks Flavor,"I listened to this Global Underground debut for Darren Emerson because of the positive impression that disc 2 of Emerson's second album in the series (GU020:Singapore) had left on me.In my opinion, Global Underground 015: Uraguay is vastly inferior when compared to its successor. Both discs are loaded with bland tracks that quickly become tiresome after a few plays. I liken this album to the typical set one would expect to hear at some dingy club mixed by a no-name amature DJ.Disc 1 gets 3/5 stars and disc 2, 2/5 stars."
2,Uninspired House,"GU has been a great provider of bringing house music to the masses and featuring great dj's (sasha,diggers,devitt etc) but this has to be the most uninspired set i have heard in a long time. Just because this guy was in underworld dosent mean he should have his own GU cd. If you are a clubber who is long in the tooth you might enjoy it...but overall it is 'ok' and that's all it is.If you want to hear something that is realy fresh and funky check out deep dish 'yoshiesque'"
3,NOT THE BEST BUT NOT THE WORST,"This cd is okay. I just expect more from GU and not a cd that's sooooo housey. I don't really care for traditional house music I prefer harder house if it's going to be done. I love the Orb song that it starts out with and Pushin' too Hard by Saints and Sinners is the best track on the cd. Other than that we have funk, funk and more funk and I'm a non-funky white guy who just couldn't get too deep into this cd. Disc 1 has bad programming on it also while disc 2 is pretty much the straightforward funk I was previously talking about. Definetely one to avoid for GU purists but if you usually don't like GU this would be the one to pick up."
3,OK... 3.5 stars,"I'm the type that enjoys his house in the deep, dark, down-in-the-dungeon, style... Alas, this cd is not that style. It's fitting that this cd was from South America, because almost all the songs have that bouncy funky feel to them and kinda reminds me of house salsa-style. A lot of people like their beats happy-house, but not me. One stand-out is track #11 on cd2 - I described it to my friend that it sounds like Nitzer Ebb (remember them?) it has those hardcore keyboards, but it's actually a great song! Other than that song though, nothing jumps out and screams ""Play me over and over again!!"" In a nutshell - if you like happy house, buy immediately. If you like the deeper darker stuff, give it a listen before you buy."
5,"Patti at her ""folksy"" best!","Finally! Two of ""The Singing Rage's"" best works of the late 60's on one disc. ""Hush Hush..."" has long been a favorite among music listeners and die hard ""Patti"" fans for decades. ""Gentle On My Mind"", a very substantial hit for Ms. Page in the late 60's was a great reason for Columbia to put her back in the studio for a marvelous folk/country music album featuring the title song. Both albums reveal a warmer, mellower, and more seasoned voice different to the still marvelous voice of the 1950's. With a strong selection of songs, marvelous orchestrations by Robert Mersey, and Ms. Page's solid delivery of each number, these two albums will likely be treasured by new comers to the CD as well as veteran fans who have enjoyed these two wonderful pieces of work for the last three decades."
1,HP Overrated!!,"I had no problems installing until I changed to Windows 2k. They want you to BUY the new drivers for this on CD instead of downloading them. To add insult to injury, one month later it died! It probably had less than 2 working hours on it! Pretty poor."
2,cheap,"advertised as OEM Motorola, but was same as cheap 99 cent holster I had purchased before elsewhere. This is a cheap holster, which can be purchased for much less elsewhere."
2,Missing Holes,"There are no assembly instructions. You have to drill two holes to complete. Lucky the chineese steel is so soft. Tires are cheap plastic. Ball is 1-7/8, not 2"". Made in China and you can tell."
2,Very light duty,"I was very dissapoonted with this product. The wheels are very weak and both wheels bent the first time I used the dolly.I contacted grizzly and told them and they responded with a "" Sorry. There are no replacement wheels available.The tongue weight on my trailer is 60 pounds. The problem is the soft wheels. This dollywill work fine after I go out and purchase some new wheels. I guesss I know why it wasPriced so low now. Buyer beware, huh?"
1,Watch corners.,I turned a corner and bent the rim. The wheels are a odd size to get replacement wheels.
2,Too small,I bought this to help me move my tent camper around. Even though it says it is good for 600 pound tongue weight and mine is 300. Camper can't be moved. Would not recommend except for small utility trailer or the like.
3,Partially Manufactured,I purchased this product and when it arrived it had no instructions..... Okay I am pretty handy at putting things togeter so I get started using nothing but the picture on the box to assemble the unit. After a couple attempts to put it together I discover that the unit is missing the holes in the handle to attach the stand. Luckily I have the tools and skill necessary to make this thing work but if I had been mechanically challenged this thing would have been in the trash or back to the seller!
3,Som issues,"Well first thing is that they forgot to send instuctions on how to put this thing together in the box, and cant find it on thier website either, I did manage to figure it out on my own, but would have been nice to have some simple instructions.Big bummer is, I wish it was maybe 3-5 inches taller, I guess I should have got one that you can adjust, but with my jetki trailer it just fits under the hitch but is too short to lift my trailer while the trailer's small swing down wheel is down, so that kinda sucks really, not sure what I am going to do about that, need to either find a way to make it taller, or I will have to try to put the wheel down while this dolly is under it, or lift the trailer myself.I might just decide to send it back :("
5,Horse shoes,The Horseshoes were great. The wood box was broken but i glued it back together. Amazon gave me a discount (thanks amazon!).This was a gift for my father and he loves them. Horseshoes are great for mostly active seniors that need to get out and do something once in a while.A great way to spend time with your old man.
2,Sold it after 4 weeks,"This mattress really stinks - in all ways. After 4 weeks of use it still smelled like a chemical factory. Then the foam - I think this is a cheap knock-off. First it is so hard and uncomfortable that my back pain got even worse, and then after 4 weeks the memory foam starts to loose its ""memory"". Now it's more like sleeping on a normal foam mattress, with the challenge not to roll in the ""hole with the lost memory"". The return policy is a kind of catch 22. You can return the product, but if you do the math you figure out that it is better to keep it, as the shipping fee is horrendous and it is almost impossible to find a company willing to ship it. Remember, once you open the package, the mattress kind of inflates, so there is no way to ship it in the same way you received it, unless you have a big vacuum machine. And finally there is the restocking fee. Well, if you want to do your self a favor, spend some more bucks and go to your nearest mattress store."
2,Contains bad chemicals,We've had it for a few days and haven't used it yet. It has a chemical smell similar to packing tape. We've placed it in a room with a lot of ventilation. It has the ability to fill the room withthe smell.I'm sure we could manage to fall asleep with the smell but I would like to know that it's safe. The company has not returned any answer on this.They did say to take off the cover and wash it. The cover now has no smell.The smell has gotten better but it is still intense when you get close to the mattress.Update: It contains TOLUENE DI ISOCYANATE 80/20 (T.D.I.). Based on looking at many websites this seems to be a carcinogen and asthma irritant asthma. Please look up on the web and you can find information on it and other people who have experienced problems.
1,"Stars cool, gets HOT, and its too small","What a rip. I was able to get over the fact that it doesnt fit my whole queen size bed, i figured ok it will just cool my core area down. I was able to get over that its like sleeping on a hard surface. But, I wasn't able to deal with waking up to the furnace of heat this thing puts off later in the night.It's amazing, it starts off ice cool and then u wake up feeling like your sleeping on top of an electric blanket. Worse then just not having it at all!"
4,"Queen 12"" with 5"" of Therapeutic Memory Foam Mattress","It's pretty comfortable, but what new mattress isn't? The foam-memory material takes a little getting used to. I generally prefer a very firm mattress, and had to get used to the ""sinking-in"" feeling. I've also found you can't really use a lot of pillows.What I like about it is that if someone else tosses and turns, or gets out of bed, you don't feel it.The smell people are referring to is like an industrial product smell, but it isn't as obnoxious as it's made out to be, but definitely present. If ignored, it will linger for about a month or so. I didn't try to spray anything on it because it didn't really bother me that much.Over all it's a good mattress, although not the greatest thing since sliced bread. I'm sure it will last a lot longer than a regular mattress, and feel I've definitely gotten my moneys worth. I would recommend it."
2,"If you are a Spock fan, you might be disappointed.",Personally I did not care for this story. I thought the author was way off base showing the lack of logic of both Spock and his charge Teska. The story was to cute for Star Trek tastes
2,had soooo much potential,This book could have been great...however it's not. it has ton's of potential...plus it lays a little background as to Spock's trying to be an ambassidor with the Romulans later in life. However it just seems to leave plot points dangeling and the ending seems a bit rushed.
3,A little disappointed,"I think that, at least in the context of this t-shirt, /(?:bb|(?!bb)..)/i is probably more appropriate than /(bb|[^b]{2})/. If Shakespeare were a perl developer, he'd be rolling over in his grave."
1,junk,"I purchased it jun 2007, first the power reserve hand quit moving so you could not tell if it was high or low,the magnifier lens for the date tends to get scratched so the date is useless and then in july 2008 it quit running altogether and the warranty is expired so i am stuck with tossing it out or throwing good money after bad"
4,watch,"The watch looked better than the photo. It keeps good time, only loosing about 2 minutes over the past month. I would recommend this product."
2,Piece of junk,"The only reason why I give this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it worked great for about six months. Then the self-winding mechanism stopped working. So I had to start winding it by hand, and then sometimes it wouldn't even wind properly by turning the crown. Also, when I would change the time (which was fairly often since it would gain or lose half a minute a day), sometimes the gears inside wouldn't engage properly and the watch would remain stopped after I finished setting it and pushed in the crown.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. Buy a REAL watch, like a nice Seiko 5 automatic (SNK805) for about the same amount of money. It will last you several years without any troubles."
2,Inferior movement,"I bought the black leather band, black face model as I really liked the looks and feel and the lack of battery, however, the movement was off and after 3 days it would be 5 minutes fast. I returned it after putting up with this for a month and haven't risked trying another one to see if it was a defective watch or typical of the model. By the way, the movement is made in China, so don't assume for $100 you're getting even bargain-grade precision quality (though my old $40 Timex movement is fine)."
4,This watch is ok.,"I hade this watch 4 a yr now.Over all so far I like the watch.Only time will tell,if it lasts 3 yrs or more minuse the wrist band.So fare the battery meter hand display stopped working but in all fairness, i have not completly given up on the watch yet."
3,Poor Product Discription !!!,This is not so much about this product as it is Amazons product discription.is it an automatic movement or a quarts movement it says both poor proof reading on Amazons part.
1,cheaply made,within several months of purchasing started to wear excessively. within one year a hole wore thru from where my foot goes. i would not buy again.
3,Too short,"I purchased these as a recommendation from my daughter's boyfriend and actually love the texture and such, but am pretty disappoined that the driver side is too short. The top of the mat does not even go behind the pedals. I have decided to keep them just so that I wont have to deal with sending them back, but per the picture, it is not what I thought it would be, :-("
2,Interviews are Great,"I bought this movie hoping for a great romantic comedy featuring Hugh Laurie. Okay, so this wasn't it--plus it was a copy from a VHS tape and the quality was not high. It's worth borrowing from a library or renting but not buying. I enjoyed watching Laurie and Nunes (pleasant personalities and both very attractive) and the samba was great fun. But all in all very ""lite."" The two engaging interviews with the leads tells you what a super film this might have been with a stronger script. Even romantic comedy needs to take it's story seriously enough to make you really care about the characters."
4,Girl from Rio,A very entertaining comedy . Hugh Laurie is excellent and the story is very good . Great music and locations. Lots of fun. A movie to keep and watch again and again .
2,"mediocre, bad dancing","This is an over-the-top romantic comedy - not a great script, but not terrible. There was enough there that the movie might have been good except for one fatal weakness: the dancing was awful. As Hugh Laurie says in his cast interview, the Raymond character is supposed to come alive when he dances, transform from drab to electrically sexy. Laurie just wasn't able to pull this off. I love Hugh Laurie - I'm a huge fan of House - but he was badly miscast. He has no physical grace, and can't dance at all. Nunes' dancing was a little better, but still not great. Why did they not use real dancers in a film where dancing is so central? Neither Laurie nor Nunes had ever danced before the film. Also, there was oddly little chemistry between them. Nunes is gorgeous, though - perfect body."
5,Great Sleeper!,"Not sure if this movie opened in the US, but due to Hugh Laurie's role in the show, ""House"" the DVD is now available. Very cute story, cute girl, and a nice mix of comedy."
3,The Prince & Me 2,I t was not as interesting as the first film. Probably due to a change of characters. It was not as interesting as the first film.
4,Predictable but sweet,"I wish Julia Stiles had continued her role in this sequel, but the story is sweet, even though it's predictable as many romantic movies are. It's worth watching. If Julia Stiles had been in it, I would give it 5 stars for sure. Definitely not bad for a sequel, as most don't quite cut it."
1,Do yourself a favor and don't buy this movie,"This movie wasn't horrible, but it wasn't very good. I ""rented"" the movie from the library and was so glad that I didn't waste any money on this. This movie has a different director and a low budget feel about it. Luke Mably was the only good thing about this. And because of his contract, he was forced to make this sequel. Trust me, you can tell that he's none to happy to be in this. Kam Heskin who now plays Paige Morgan, can't hold a candle to Julia Stiles, honestly Kam isn't very good.I was disappointed because the original Paige, was determine and strong willed who believed in her following her dreams. I understand compromise has to be made in any relationship but this sequel turned Paige into a wimp. Don't get me wrong there are some funny moments in this but even those can't save this poorly made movie."
4,Cute movie.,This was a cute follow up to the first movie. However I liked Julia Stiles better than the new actress.
5,A step out of real life,"I know there are alot of negative reviews about this movie, but I disagree. Since we have to live in reality, why not enjoy a fairy tale that ends happy? Deep down we all want to have a relationship where we admire and support one another. . . to be cherished and encouraged. It's just a happy movie in the midst of real life. A get away and relax. Laugh and cry. I think they did a tremendous job. Wish there were more like this. I think Kam brings an elegance to the character that Julia didn't have as a ""queen-to-be"". She did great in the first one, but Kam is more refined and flows better in this part. More like a queen, than a farm girl. She makes it more believable. She has tremendous character and self-control and really shows her love by her actions. I greatly enjoyed this movie and liked it the best of all 4 of them. Luke does a regal job and is very cute too! I know others will disagree, but if you just want a dreamy, fairy-tale romance, this is it! Happily ever after!"
2,Captain Vic,"I could never understand why a series of pictures are planned and then you change the cast. With all respect to Kam Heskin she does just not cut it as Paige Morgan. The actors presenting Edvard and Paige's parents are totally out of sinc with the characters as portraide in the Prince and Me. O, and then Jonathan Firth as Zorin, please give me a break, where did you find this guy. Please guys you have messed this up. Acting on the most part was amateuristic. Disappointing after the Prince and Me."
3,Not as Good as the Original but not Bad either!!,"I enjoyed watching The Prince & Me 2.Not as good as the original but it's not that bad as some reviews are making out that it is.Okay, none of the original cast came back to the sequel, other than Luke Mably but Kam Heskin played a nice Paige and Joathan Fith performance as Soren was very good.The Prince & me 2 isn't a five star production BUT if you watch the sequel for what it is you will find that it is a nice clean romantic comedy. Give this movie a go!!"
1,IF 'Kam' could act...,"I will just say that I saw Kam Heskin in another movie, ""Pride and Prejudice"", and I'm afraid she just can't act. But, I had seen ""The Prince and Me"" and was anxious to see the sequel. Luke Mably is always good to watch, but not with a noose around his neck. I am sorry, for him, that this was such an awful movie. It could have worked with a convincing, capable co-star."
1,Huge letdown,"After watching Julia Stiles bring an exciting chemistry with Luke Mably on phase one of this story, it is unconscionable that the producers allowed all the ""subs"" to be part of this second act. There was no meshing of Eddie and Paige in this version, and leaving out the original parents of both was a HUGE mistake. Part of the charm of the first version was the interaction of Eddie with Paige's family. There was much to explore in the sequel for Paige to do the same with Eddie's parents. And, Arrabella was left out completely. This was a slapstick attempt at comedy and romance and this movie failed on both counts."
3,The Prince & Me 2,"I like the first one, but they change the actress and it is not the same. I rate it fair and got it to go with the first one."
1,Don't even consider!,"Absolutely horrible! With the exception of the Prince, all the other characters are played by different actors from the first movie. I don't know how Luke Mably accepted to do this movie again as the Prince. The actress playing Paige Morgan would be better off in a shalow role of a high school movie. The other actors aren't convincing as well."
3,It was ok,"While I did like the movie I was kind of disappoited that they were not able to keep the same cast for the families, including the assistant to the Prince/King."
3,What happened!,"I first saw this movie on an international plane flight. It was about an aspiring medical student and an incognito prince, heir aparant to the throne of a European country. A typical chick flick, they meet, fall in love, she is not aware of his real position and agrees to go home with him over a holiday and discovers he is real live royalty. He proposes, his family objects to commoners, she is reluctant to cast aside her work toward healing the sick. They bid each other goodbye and go their separate ways. It's a tolerable movie when you are spoon fed it on a plane.Now several years later I find it has been released modified and with several sequals added. Prince and me now has Prince and me Royal Wedding, Prince and me Honeymoon, Prince and me.... Prince and me....Prince and me ad nausiam. What happened?"
3,Not as bad as I thought,The Prince and Me 2 is a sequel to The Prince and Me.Luke Mably is the only actor that was actually in the original and while it takes a little to get past the differences the movie is not too bad.Paige Morgan and Prince Edvard of Denmark are engaged to be married. That is until Edvard's distant cousin finds a law that states that The King has to marry a royal from Denmark and trys to get his daughter Kirsten to break up the engagment.Soon it looks like Edvard and Paige are history and that he will marry Kirsten. Paige doesnt give up though and goes looking for a loophole so that she and Edvard can get married.What happens next? Watch Prince and Me 2
3,Ok,"I agree: It would have been better with Julia Stiles, stuck with the original actors, and went more with the original movie, and in reality the original didn't need a sequal. But it was okay. I'm just glad,that Paige and Eddie ended up together. Also: THERE IS NO WAY A ANCIENT LAW LIKE THAT COULD BE VALID.Antiquated means outdated. It's just that a guy wanted to start something over it. Think Eddie's mother was looking for an excuse again for him not to marry Paige? Notice she said protect the ""monarchy"" not law? Think that this other guy threatened her? Royalty aren't the main lawmakers anymore, so by law they can marry whoever they want, and no one could stop them. BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY A LAW LIKE THIS COULD BE VALID IF IT'S OUTDATED. If Eddie's mother was looking for a way again, for Eddie not marry Paige, that's back-stabbing, because in the first one saw that Paige was good for him. So what was it?Again, ok movie though.Chantell"
3,Not as good as the first one.,"This was not as bad as some have said, but it's not the best either. If Julia had stayed and played Paige it would have made the movie so much better. Overall the movie was ok."
1,"Watch it if you must, but be prepared for the worst","I hadn't even realized that there were plans to make a sequal, I happened to stumble acrossed this film while purchasing another movie. At first I was excieted because I am a self proclaimed royalty acholic and I enjoy finding any film or show royalty related. This however was the biggest disappointment since the last Princess Diaries book came out. It was more like a satire of the first film than a sequal, resorting to slap stick acting and totally unrealistic scenario's. Worst of all, the wedding dress and tiara, they looked like she ran to the local mall and picked them out. Last time I checked Denmark had a nice jewelry collection, they weren't going to let the future queen wear something at least real? There are some Danish fashion houses I'm sure who would have made that poor girl an original dress so she wasn't stuck with one right off the rack. Utterly disappointing at best."
1,if there was a zero... this film wouldve got it!,"i cant believe this. i loved the first one but what was this!? the new girl was just dumb, her parents were a complete joke. they looked absolutely NOTHING like the first one. oh and i thougth edvard's dad was dying? all a sudden in the second movie he not only was in perfect health... but grew his hair back! and soran was the only half decent character... besides edvard... who was also a big flop. he didnt have the same personality AT ALL..... DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! it almost ruins the first one. i just finished the second one and now im going to haft to watch the first one over.... just so i feel a little better. YUCK!"
1,Defnitely one to skip,"This was terrible...I like cutesy movies, but this was just bad. First of all, they only had like one repeat actor and all the new replacments were NOT as good. The plot wasn't that bad, but they played it out all for comedic effect and it was not enjoyable. I fast forwarded through many parts. There were lots of slap-stick comedy moments and none of them were really worth it. This movie could have been good...the plot wasn't that bad, but the actors were not up the movie, the script was trite and they went for every bad joke and pun. So I definitely recommend skipping this movie. I should have known it was bad when I hadn't seen anything about it before seeing it in the video store."
3,Disappointed,"I was hoping for a movie that was similar to the first, which was, of course, excellent. I was terribly disappointed, however. Luke Mably is the only actor from the original movie. The movie was seriously lacking without Julia Stiles, Ben Miller, and Miranda Richardson. It just wasn't the same. The plot had some potential, but still, it fell short.All in all, it did keep me watching, but I really was hoping for more."
1,awful,If you liked the first movie then the sequel was a huge disappointment. Julia Stiles was better than this actress. Giving this one star is more than generous.
3,"A very nice love story, though poorly told; but still a good watch.","It's true, the 1st 1 w/ Julia Stiles was done better, but Kam Heskin is a much prettier girl & therefore more enjoyable to watch, than Julia Stiles. It's sad that the 2nd one wasn't done as well, but I still enjoyed it, because it's a good love story. A wholesome storyline, pleasant to watch nevertheless, compared to all the sordid ones: murders, etc.As always Luke is cute or a ""hunk"", even though he's skinny; & he's a real good actor. I won't be surprised if he becomes a big star sooner than later. Will probably watch every movie he makes.I think he & Kam make a lovely couple. Their chemistry developed towards the end, especially their wedding kiss. Inspite of its warts, it's still an enjoyable movie. I'll still recommend to others."
3,The Prince And Me 2,"What can I say? The movie was a romantic, modern fairy tale. It is okay and I liked it okay but wasn't wonderful."
3,I miss Julia Stiles,"I am never a fan of a sequel if you can't get the main people back. The fill in did okay, but I prefer Julia. It was an okay, predictable romantic movie."
5,Pleased,As was stated in the description on the website. Correct movie enclosed and brand new no problems with the quality of disc
2,Mind Numbing,I watched this while folding laundry because I wanted something mindless in the background. But it was worse than I expected from a sequel. I can see why Julie Stiles didn't return for this one.
2,it could had been better,"prince edvard is very handsome like always but his face got a little older and the hair is different i like his hair on the first movie. and i like paige morgan the original one the second paige morgan doesnt really act the same she is much to soft to look at, she doesnt fill and act like she is in the movie she doesnt fit like a princess. while julia is innocent but more like she knows how to act a lot better.. you go girl"
3,not as bad as all that,"Even though this sequel didn't include any of the orignal cast except for Luke Mably, it wasn't as bad as some of the previous reviews make it out to be. I have definitely seen some worse sequels than this.Though Julia Stiles would have been better than Kam Heskin, it is a sequel worth watching. Just because other people don't like that doesn't mean you won't; just rent it from a local video store and if you like it enough to want to buy it then go ahead."
3,"Good, but short","Very good, but a tad short. Loved what it had to say, but would have been good if it carried the information much further."
3,Seemed shallow and self-involved,"I suppose that I approach life from a different point of view than the author. He thinks that the reason to do good things is so that you will be happy -- at the end of the day, for the author -- it is all about internal, self-involved feelings. My view is fundamentally different: One should do the right, good, and kind thing, irrespective of whether it will bring you happiness; once one adopts this attitude, happiness is very likely to follow. Trying to maximize happiness (which is very different from maximizing pleasure) is like chasing a rainbow's end -- you will never arrive at your hoped-for destination. You must step outside of yourself and your own desires to become truly happy. That being said, the author is bright and entertaining -- and I do not mean to suggest that he is not a good person."
5,Wonderful discoveries,"This is what creative program-building is all about - combining the familiar (Bach WTC) with the virtually unknown (Fischer, who wrote preludes & fugues just before Bach did, in a similar style). Great performers and composers often refer to Bach as their favorite, and most of us are aware of his influence on later repertoire, but here the ""far corners"" of these relationships are explored, we are freshly enlightened. I had the privilege of studying with Mr. Nagel for two years in the 1960's, and greatly admire his inspiring work, in which teaching and thinking is fruitfully married to playing and listening."
5,#2's,Look and work the same as they have for a long long time. Very happy with these and would buy them again.
1,don't waste your money on a Samsung HT-SK5,"The HT-SK5 is a lemon--don't buy it. Although the sound quality is great, the audio doesn't match the video when you're using a digital input, like digital HDTV. So, the lips don't match the words on any digital stations. It made it impossible to watch any HDTV programming, which essentially was why I bought it.After 3 months of dealing with Samsung's poor technical support, including shipping the product back to Samsung, I learned from Samsung that they can't fix the problem, and they don't have a replacement product that would work better. The only thing more frustrating than the audio sync problem was Samsung's awful technical support. The staff was poorly educated about their own products, they never returned calls or e-mail like they promised, and seemed to have no concern for their customers. Don't waste your money--in fact, Samsung treated me so poorly, I can't recommend buying any Samsung products."
