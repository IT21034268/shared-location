1,Disappointed,"You are advertising this product as buy the beatles and it is not . These are Beatle song, but are buu unknown artist. I was very disappointed and asking for refund."
4,Sliders -- Best of all worlds!,"Although, occasionally, the author writes the wrong name of a character in the sentences he is using (Example: using Quinn's name when he should have used Arturo's), the book itself is quite a find. It's interesting, hurmorous, spellbinding, and keeps you from wanting the story to end. Best of all, despite the numerous differences, it can't help but bring to mind Richard Bach's ""ONE"". Thumbs up all around for this gem"
3,Seen the pilot? Then don't read the book.,"This is a near verbatim written version of the events of the pilot episode. If you missed the pilot then you'll enjoy finding out the origins of the Sliders story. However, if you've seen the pilot then don't bother reading this; the only thing new that you'll learn is that Arturo gets turned on when Wade falls on him, something that I'd rather not have known."
3,This was a GREAT book but.....,This was a great book! It was filled with action and suspense. If I hadn't seen the Pilot episode I would have constantly been guessing what was gonna happen next. The only problem I found was that the author used the wrong character's name for stuff sometimes. That detracted from the book quality.
3,Not up to Peter David's standards.,"Not a bad book, but definitely not one of David's best; he clearly fell in love with the character of Stone, who I found obnoxious and annoying. I simply could not find it in me to understand why this was supposed to be a sympathetic character. Nor was it plausible that a character with his problems would have passed psych profiles, much less been able to read as ""sane"" to Deanna Troi. The man as portrayed was clearly pathological.Other than that, the writing was, as usual for David, excellent."
1,A Rock and a Hard Place,"Your book is too expensive. I am a Star Trek fan and I would like to have all the Star Trek books I have read in paperback format added to my Kindle, but I will not be adding your book. This book which I own in paperback is price too high. I think the price should be in the 3 dollar range. Because of its current price I would not be adding it to my KindleA Rock and a Hard Place"
3,O.K.,"I was slightly disappointed with this novel.It seems to shift back and forth,from being overly brutal to extremly sentimental.It's one of those ""man vs. nature"" with a bit of genetical engineering thrown in.I groaned when Comm. Stone found that his ""soul mate"" was a Wild Thing.This is so typical of ""man vs. nature"" books.And it definatly would have been more dramatic if Stone had died(yes,Picard and Deanna would be staying about how strange yet amazing Stone was...but...).I expected more from Peter David,who usually writes more interesting things,but this IS a good book for Riker fans,as it shows some of his past and explores his personnality,and that's why I decided to read it."
5,Wonderful blanket!,"This blanket is a nice soft, great fitting, wonderful blanket. I am very happy with it! Gorgeous color."
5,About Michell Jarrell,"I am the violinist from Georgia. I know M. Jarrell as proffessor of Wien Musical University and I know that he is one of the greatest composers nowadays. I want to listen to his music, meet him and know more about his works. I shall be glad to have his CDs. I am going to study in that University and I belive that I'll meet him."
4,Tall dark and dangerous,"It was very good, the characters fit very well into the story line.Suzanne is a good author, hard to put the book down."
3,Good Album...but where's the best song?????,"This is a decent album. I'm not a huge fan, but they had a few good months appearing on TRL and pushing pop music in a slightly more rock direction. At least compared to Backstreet Boys and such. BUT where is the song ""Owe""?????? The reason I purchased this album was for that single. I can find a hundred copies of the lyrics posted online, but I can't find the song ANYWHERE! If any one knows where I can pick up the best song, or even find it for a single listen, then please let me know."
2,pretty average soft rock,i had never heard justincase before i saw them recently at merlefest in north carolina. i saw nothing great but i dont really ever listen to disposable pop. the band is pretty much just another goo goo dolls with a few distorted pop-punk ... songs. so i guess you could say its sorta like a mix between the foo fighters and goo goo dolls. they are nothing i would fork over [money] to listen to so my suggestion is that if you are hung up on hearing this band ....
3,"too big, and only for men","the watch is HUGE, it's clearly for a huge man's wrist and the watch part of it is so long that unless you had very wide wrists it doesn't curve with your wrist, so it looks weird when you put it on, I'm returning it."
1,not satified,I made 5 fruit cakes and they are stuck to the pan. Iwas very dissatified with the pans. I bought some formy sister
1,Piano Chords,"This book was recommended by my daughter's piano teacher, so I bought it. Although the exercises are okay, but they were not fun. Instead it became a turn off for my daughter. Don't buy this book if your kids are doing well with the piano and are having fun playing the Piano. This book is like sending an A-Student into remedial lessons or summer school. Instead get some songbooks or sheet music which they like to sing and play. Make Piano lessons fun... not a chore."
3,It's ok...,"I'm only about 25% into the book, and it's ok. I will say that the instructions for the assignments can come off a bit vague. The examples given aren't always reflective of the work to be done by the student. But I'll admit that I wasn't expecting a super-in-depth book; simply judging by the title. Nothing horrible, nothing amazing."
5,How coule someone make this interesting?,"Undertaking merely one of the two volumes of Asimov's autobiography seems a daunting task, but as Orson Scott Card said at a signing I recently attended, ""Asimov's style is so liquid. He led a boring life and yet I found myself turning the pages eagerly."" This is exactly the position I found myself in reading this and the next tome of Asimov's life story: enthralled. This comes in part from a keen interest in the man, his work, and life, and also in part from the simple fact that he was such a damn good writer. I wouldn't recommend the book as light reading, but for anyone who is interested in the genius and his life, don't hesitate."
3,More factual details than u wanna know of anybody's life!,"Still, he manages to make even the mundane material seeminteresting."
1,waste of money,"Poorly written, childish name calling and half truths, many with no factual evidence wastes the readers time. Where are the state by state election calls--if Gore was winning by 3%, a state was called for him within 20 minutes after the polls closed--or many before the polls closed. I watched the results, and waited almost 2 1/2 hours befor Bush double digit wins in Tennessee and Arkansas were put in his column. The author is a fiction writer, I'm afraid. I was looking for facts."
4,Kitschy classic,"This little book is a great 'blast from the past' for diner lovers. It has recipes in all categories, but the biggest hits are the desserts -- like the sky high banana cream pie."
5,One of the best diner cookbooks out there,"I really love this cookbook! Not only are the recipes all from diners across the country, but they all contain ingredients you would find in a typical cupboard. It also has wonderful images from back in the day and a history of the diner. I would buy this as a gift and I plan to buy the other cookbooks for myself!"
2,Now I Don't Know if I Trust These Recipes,"I recently bought this book, and tonight I was looking through to see what recipes I might like to make.On page 11 is a recipe for ""Hunter's Crescent Rolls."" It tells you to soften yeast in warm water, and set aside. And apparently leave aside forever, as they aren't mentioned further in the recipe! No mention of when to mix in the yeast.This is disheartening, and makes me wonder if the other recipes have similar errors."
5,A fine analysis of the next generation of weapons and communications systems,"Military technologies of modern times may be viewed as primitive tomorrow: that's the message of The Greeks Of War: The Secretive Labs And Brilliant Minds Behind Tomorrow's Warfare Technologies. New military techniques are born in not just government labs, but private and academic labs as well: author Edwards gained access to individuals at these institutions and conducted interviews with the scientists, analysts and program directors involved in battlefield technology. From how weapons are developed to other lines of wartime technology, Geeks Of War offers fine analysis of the next generation of weapons and communications systems."
5,Sony DCR-HC48 1MP MiniDV Handycam Camcorder,This video camera is smaller than my digital camera. It's easy to use and the only real problem I've had so far is learning to tape with one hand. It takes pictures in darkness beautifully. I've had fun playing with all of the bells and whistles. This is the first video camera I've purchased since buying a huge Panasonic camera in 1987. Lots of changes since then.
4,Camera phenomenal; Sony lousy,"I hope to give a more in depth review later, but wanted to be sure to make it clear to everyone that a Firewire cable (the so-called iLink) is not included with this product.The camera itself is intuitive and easy to use out of the box but also highly customizable. The video and sound quality are excellent, and the LCD screen is gorgeous and uses touch screen buttons in addition to the button bar beneath it. But Sony has a way of making fantastic products and then alienating the purchasers of those products (a la the PS3). So understand that in order to do the very basic and essential task of transferring your DV images to your computer requires you to shell out $35-70 more to buy a Firewire cable. The provided USB cable is for transferring stills from the Memory Stick only. Thus, this camera can only receive 4 stars due to Sony's cheap skate approach. Caveat emptor..."
2,Terrible Design,"The camera has ok video quality, but cannot be used with direct fire wire input without the dock. If your using it to directly record to a computer or other device do not buy this because it needs to be in the dock to share the video output with a computer. This makes this camera absolutely useless when its on a tripod because it cannot be connected to the dock as well."
5,Very easy to use,"This camera is very easy to use, is lightweight and so far has had great battery life. I've had no trouble capturing my video using the i-link to USB cable as that's the only port available on my laptop. For me it's been great value for the price."
5,Great little camcorder,"I got exactly what I wanted: a camcorder that carries easily under a coat or sweater and can also take still pictures suitable for snapshots. Snapshots up to 4x6 are fine but not as good as my 7 megapixel Olympus, but since I can take pictures immediately instead of waiting for the camera to start up it has worked out that 90% of my still photos are on the HC-48."
2,It's a shame this thing broke,"We got this camera for a christmas gift when I was pregnant with my son, seeing as how it was my first child, I wanted a video camera to capture his life! I had a sony before and it was knocked over onto a hard floor by my young nephew and it quit working, but I know I like sony cameras. This camera had all the features I wanted, and it was a good price. Unfortunately it stopped working after just a couple uses. The part that you put the tape in is stuck open and it won't close. It's never been dropped or abused. We used it ONE time and that was to film the birth of my son and then it stopped working. It's unfortunate because it's hard to find cameras with comparable features to this one now days. You spend an arm and a leg on video cameras today and you dont even get a light on the camera and they have TERRIBLE indoors quality even with plenty of lights turned on."
4,Nice Camera,I havent noticed many of the problems others had experianced with this camcorder. We are on our third tape now and no motor noise or anything. The zoom is great I havent read the manual yet so havent used any of the features. I like it and think its good value for money. It can be found for less else where thou...
1,Sony Handy-trainwreck,"I had the camera for about 2 years before I got the dreaded 'C32 errors' Sometimes the cassette door won't open, sometimes it won't close. If I get it to close, I get the message ""reinsert tape"" message. Googling the error comes up with a couple of fixes 1) slam it down on the table a couple of times (this works for awhile) or 2) send it back to Sony where they will charge you the original purchase price - 9$ to fix it. or 3) There are Youtube videos showing you how to dis-assemble your camera completely to replace the 'mode gear', but thats too close to micro-surgery for me and if thats a Sony part, what's to keep that one from failing as quickly as the original. I have had 'bad luck' with Sony electronics recently; I think I will strike them off my list in the future when looking for electronic gear. Its too bad, because when the camera didn't suck it worked pretty good."
4,Useful and handy,"Good quality and variety. Useful for cell phone, pda and other appliances repair and maintenance."
2,"Low, very low quality....find something else","The handle just broke on the very first use. It is made of a very weak plastic, the nut does tight.It is too expensive for the quality you get. I decided to give it to my nephew for playing. It is not a serious tool set.If you are buying because of the Torx T4, T5 or T6....just forget it, they do not work."
1,Poorly manufactured...,"The drill bit set is complete. The problem is that the handle will NOT hold any of the bits. It is made of plastic and immediately breaks. This product is poorly manufactured. You get what you pay for, this is a POC and not worth the money, or hassle - unless you just need the bits. I am returning this, I wish I didn't buy it."
1,Might as well flush $10 down the toilet,"I bought this set mainly for the torx bits as I needed to tear down (and remove the platters from) several old hard drives. The first thing you'll notice is that the handle is made of incredibly cheap plastic that, as soon as you need to apply any pressure, bends out at the tip where you insert the bit and you have to fish the bit out of the inside of the plastic case. I broke the handle and the bit is almost unrecognizable (due to the soft nature of the metal) on the first of 10 hard drives that I needed to break down. UPS delivered this set at 4:15 (it's now 5:57) and I've already thrown it away. Terrible, terrible product that I'm surprised the manufacturer isn't embarrassed to sell.Steer clear."
1,Metal Heads but cheap plastic handle,"I got this yesterday and am returning it today. The different metal heads are fine, but they skimped on the handle. It is all plastic where the heads are inserted and the screw part is plastic also. This may work for a short while but it will never last in the long run. I should have read the reviews and saved myself some time. Do yourself a favor and pay a little more and get something that will last."
2,Broke the handle first time using,Well for around 10 bucks you get what you pay for. The handle is just plain junk. I would not buy anything like this driver set again. Cheapy and it breaks easy. I also stripped one of the allen heads as well.
2,"Great bit set, useless driver","First off, if you plan to buy this, buy it only for the bits. The plastic driver breaks after light use and doesn't tighten well, if you are buying assume there's no driver included. The bits are a nonstandard size, but they are the same size as RadioShack's precision screwdriver kit. Overall not worth the money, you can buy other 32 bit kits on amazon WITH a metal driver for about the same price."
1,Cheap and flimsy,"This item is cheap and flimsy. I purchased it specifically for the torx attachments. However the item description was not clear - the torx attachments do not work with torx security screws (the ones with a pin in the middle). Also the handle is cheap plastic, and if you twist too hard the support rod literally spins within the handle. Do not buy!"
4,not gonna last,I really like this thing but it is not real durable by design.it does work well and offers great versatility.the case is pretty bad but holds tools.
4,Good tool set for the price.,"Haven't had the handle problems that other reviewers have reported. I will say that as far as the bits go, they're great and if you have mini or micro torx screws that need tightening, this is a great set for that. Overall a good buy."
2,works for a week,worked for about a week then the black pice that holds the bits in fell off and when i tried to put it back on the pice would not snap in like it did before it came off would not get this item
4,As advertized,"Good, includes everything it says and seems to be fairly high quality. The only downside is that the screw driver part that holds the bit is not very narrow so you cant get at screws that are greatly recessed. Keep in mind this is not full of tamper proof bits"
2,What good is a screw driver that won't drive screws?,"There's a great selection of bits here and the screw driver is generally useful for light work, like computer case screws, but any medium to heavy work will just twist the bit in the handle. You can forget doing anything with wood screws. The bits are fairly wide, so you can't do anything that's recessed, either. In short, you'll need a second set of screwdrivers for a lot of jobs, which defeats the purpose of a set like this."
1,Piece of crap,"The bits are held into the handle by VERY THIN PLASTIC. I broke this thing on the very first job I used it for. Barely applied any force to remove a laptop screw, and the handle broke.Never recommend this to anyone."
1,Useless,Poor quality. T5 stripped screws so I can't get them out at all now. The handle doesn't even hold the bits properly.
1,Crap!!!,The first time I used this set the T-6 wore down and stopped working.If I could give this a zero or negative numbers I would.
4,Anytime Tools 32 pc MICRO PRECISION SCREWDRIVER SET,"Like other reviewers said, the plastic handle is extremely cheap. I see myself braking in next few times of use. Otherwise, it has different size screw bits and it will come in handy in the future."
2,"No sir, I don't like it....","I originally got this set because it was so cheap... of course the age old adage ""you get what you pay for"" proves to be the case one again. Now, don't get me wrong, these bits do work. But the extension piece, which is required to use this screwdriver set, is garbage. The extension has no way to stay secure so it slips down into the handle every time, no matter how much tightening is done around it. The handle is ridiculously cheaply made plastic and feels as if it will break in your hands while using it. If you need an extremely cheap precision screwdriver set with no reach that is for light tasks then this isn't that bad of a set, but if you need a set for specialized, harder use then you probably aren't looking at this set anyway."
4,Very Handy,"This tool kit helps with just about every electrical problem i have. My only complaint is that the twist grip to hold onto attachments is pretty weak. If the screw or bolt is too tight, the attachments will often spin in place inside handle. So, not good for highly tightened screws and bolts, but will get the job done otherwise."
4,A great kit for small electronic work,"This kit has many different pieces for taking apart small appliances, electronics, and toys. If you are doing any work on you cell phone you will need some of these bits. The drivers worked great, but one of them stripped out after only a few uses, and that may have been my error for trying to get the screw tighter than it should have been, once stripped out they bit is trash, and replacement of these bits may be hard to do. The screwdriver that comes with it is not magnetic so in order to hold the but in place you have to lock it in place by twisting the screwdriver to tighten the connection, which only takes a few seconds. For the price and convenience there is nothing bad about this set, just be aware if you are a beginner to not over tighten the screws and always be sure you are using the right size so to not strip out the screw or the bit. Overall if you just need to do minor fixes every once in a while I would recommend this kit."
4,what I needed in a jam,"This is what I needed at the time, arrived sooner than expected, but not a tool for any long term use, but you get what you pay for. the handle it comes with is plastic but the adapter is metal and could be put into a power drill if needed or another handle could be fashioned if the supplied one fails. Overall, what I was looking for and will not need any more small tips for a while!"
2,Review,"All the bits seems fine, but the handle felt like it was going to break any minute, so I returned it."
2,cheap staff,"this one is cheap, of course, but its quality is suck. I don't like it. If you wanna a trustable tool, buy a expensive one."
3,"Is cheap, but does the job.","I bought this item because I was about to start an upgrade for my Unibody MacBook Pro when I realized that I didn't have the necessary tools. So I went for this one... I can't say that I love the product but what can I expect for something that didn't cost me not even 10 bucks. It feels cheap (because it is..), but as soon as you insert the metal thingy inside of the plastic screw driver itself, it does the job.If you want something to fix a thing quick and then forget about it, this is the right product."
5,Nice Trox screewdriver,Easy to use. Very accurate. Strong enough. Used this T6 to open my laptop HDD cover and repaired the laptop in few minutes. If some one need Trox screwdriver this is the good supplier.
3,Great Tool Set. But poor quality handle & non standard shaft.,"Very useful tool kit. But the handle is all plastic and comes with a warning to use it cautiously to avoid damage to the plastic handle. If the handle breaks, the tool heads are useless because the shafts are non standard. Wish they were 1/4"" shafts so that I can use it with most other handles."
2,"Good bits, useless screwdriver","The bit selection is great. The non-standard bit size isn't so great when the included screwdriver lasts one or two uses before it's cheap plastic parts crack open. There is a warning to this effect, but even with that the cheapness of the included screwdriver almost makes the set useless.I've yet to try using the bits with my adjustable drill chuck or any other adaptor but a quick search online showed that some manufacturers do sell sizes other than the standard 1/4"" bit holders. I'm looking into replacing the screwdriver with a nicer one if I can find a size match since the smaller shank is useful for some small electronics.I'll update this review if I find a good solution, otherwise I'd recommend buying a set with either standard bits or a more robust screwdriver."
2,Not tough enough,"This set contained the Torx driver I needed to replace a Jeep headlight. But the plastic collar that you turn to hold the bit in the handle cracked open while being finger-tightened! I was still able to get the job done. The tool was not tough enough, but what do you expect for a 32-piece set for $13?"
1,Oxide,"This practical tool. The screwdriver is good for work in house. But the material is bad, the pieces deterioate with rust."
4,Great for the money,I just got it yesterday and already used it 3 times. It works fine! The plastic handle looks a little cheap but unless your are unscrewing something that has been way over tightened it should work fine.
3,Not bad... but not great.,"The set is good insofar as the amount of tips included and types of screwdriver tips. The only drawback in my opinion is in the quality of the handle. It's all plastic and a little flimsy. If you don't intend to use this item for anything that requires a lot of torque, this is a good set. If you need something that requires a lot of torque... look for something else. I've used this for computer component dis-assembly/assembly and it's worked well."
4,very affordable set,very versatile set and you definitely get what you pay for but luckly small screws dont take to much force to unscew
1,Disappointed,"Problem is that the small units strip extremely fast, I couldn't finish opening my computer which was the first step of my project. Its as though this screwdriver set is made of lead, and strips inside the screw and crumbles."
3,"Got 3 because it's inexpensive, otherwise it would be 1-2","This is very cheap and breaks easily. Any time you have plastic trying to hold steel you have a problem. The bits also fall out of their holder very easily. The plastic tightener doesn't hold the extender well enough so if you have to apply any pressure you could slide it all the way down and then it's a pain to get out. The case broke in 5 minutes.If you feel like you are only ever going to work on this one computer/xbox and never do it again, then this could work for that. But if you use these tools often, don't waste your time.Like I said, for the price it's okay, but it's not a permanent solution."
5,What an inspiration...,"I had *just* finished this author's book on flower essences (another 5-star one in my opinion, though I haven't gotten to writing that review yet), when I felt drawn to reading her personal story. And what a story it is!Watching her grow from introspective, imaginative child to ""how in the world did she survive all that? "" teen, to awe-inspiring woman of nature, Machaelle Small Wright takes you on a spiritual journey you will not soon forget. And she does it with wonderful self-effacing humor and a down-to-earth grittiness that draws you toward her, rather than dismissing her as someone unusual. She states we ALL have this potential within us, and I'm prone to believe her (from my own experiences.)So if you are interested in how to live more in harmony with our world, period, or just like reading a good story--this book has it...Get it. Read it. And never be the same (in a GOOD way! :)"
2,Worth reading,"Having said that this is worth reading, then giving it only two stars reflects my mixed feelings about this and other of Machaelle Small Wright's writings. There are LARGE chunks of this book that are repeated *verbatim* in *several* of her other works, including the Perelandra Workbooks. I bought all these books to find out as much as I could about what she is doing and how she is doing it. Unfortunately I've had to wade through tens and dozens of pages of the same stuff over and over and over and over again to glean the small bits of unique information contained in each book. Much of what appears here also appears (verbatim!) in Co-Creative Science, Dancing in the Shadows of the Moon, and in the Perelandra Workbooks. Frustrating."
3,1969 over again,"I purchased this book to stimulate my somewhat lost spirituality that our current business, living environment no longer supports. This read did this as it was old news long forgotten by this 60 year old Wiccan. Fitness Diva small business entrepreneur who has focused on physical development of the body since 1994. I found myself saying, ""Yeah, this is common knowledge, nature has it personal energy that all humans experience on some level."" I must admit with our growing concrete cities, oil spills this book reminded me to practice the art of nature. I am now back to listening. I did put the book down, leaving the last 50 pages unread."
4,Machaelle helps remind us of what life could be like.,"Machaelle writes openly of her life and her experiences. This book is invaluable in understanding why it is so important to honor life on this planet. To share that honor with all that exists. For too long we have dominated the planet with no concern for the animal & mineral kingdoms, but this book reminds us of the power of growing and living consciously. It is a must for all who want to live more in touch with this planet we live on.."
4,A true gem,"When I first found this book, I was drawn into it and could not put it down. The first third or so of the book was a bit plodding (hence the loss of a star), but there's a true gem to be found in later chapters. Hint: I've never seen poop of such great value. Those who have read the book will surely know what I refer to."
5,Nifty,"Use this every night so I don't have to turn on lights in the house (and wake anyone).I use a rechargeable battery, and it needs recharging every couple of weeks.The light is a circle with a defined outline. My first light had a diffuse outline. I found at Walmart for a lot less, especially with the rip-off shipping charges at Amazon.My only complaint is that the rubber around the head slips off easily.The rubber in the middle is fine for cushioning my teeth when I hold it for close work that needs more light."
4,very bright,I keep this in my truck. Puts out a lot of light for a small light. I am pleased with the value for the price.
5,Live treat.,This is the best live jam I've heard since The Allman Bros. Band Live at the Fillmore East.This was playing at a local C D exchange and it really got my attention. Glad he had it in stock.I almost put a hole in my pocket trying to get to my money to pay for this awesome recording.
3,"5 stars for solos, 1 star for songwriting","All these songs rely on 1 single riff (stolen from Allman Brothers, ZZ Top, etc.) with little or no chord progression or rhythm change. If it weren't for Randolph's great solos, this would be one of the most one-dimensional releases ever. Randolph would be better off collaborating with a great song writer and filling in the solos. It's great to watch him play, but these bland songs get old fast. I would recommend watching his Austin City Limits performance if you get a chance."
1,Very disappointing,"I hate to be the naysayer, but this record sucks. If you listen to the 30-second snippets of each song on Amazon, multiply each one by about 20 and that's what the song sounds like. It's just a bunch of noodling that never goes anywhere or generates an iota of excitement. Randolph seems to be a very talented guy; I first saw him on a telecast of the Crossroads Guitar Festival and thought ""Wow! Who's this guy?"" Tremendous promise, but not at all fulfilled on this album. This is the first review I've ever written, and I'm doing it mainly because I'm so irritated that this record turned out to be such a disappointment."
1,Sham,"These guys are pretty much like alot of other modern actsfrom hip hop, country, and rock. All the same stuff. Theyhave a fake image that fooled me for a small time... Butthat will not happen again. Really this is the sameredneck vibe. These guys are Allman Brothers wannabes."
3,A foot-stomping good time,"It's hard not to keep your foot from stomping while listening to 'Live At The Wetlands'. The last time I felt such electrically charged power was while attending a B.B. King concert, a tribute to the live-energy captured by this CD. 'Ted's Jam' is a stunning opener, a relentless blues-jam workout. Robert Randolph himself is a gifted guitarist straddling between Duane Allman and Stevie Ray Vaughan, capturing the improvisational spirit of B.B. King. What Miles Davis is on the trumpet, precise notes bursting with emotion, Robert Randolph is on the steel pedal guitar. The supporting cast is more an ensemble, eg, Sly Stone or Funkadelic, with Randolph as the focal-point of this talented blues/funk jam collective. Ear piercing, dynamic, and joyous. An impressive live album, spine-chilling in it's musicianship, all in the spirit of having a rollicking good time. Shake, rattle, and roll. Let Robert Randolph lead the way."
5,"ONE OF A KIND, IN THIS DAY & AGE","They just don't make musicians like Robert Randolph anymore. This CD is incredible, hasn't left the car for 6 weeks. It has quickly become my favorite in my collection. Robert Randolph brings back times of sheer, unadulterated pleasure when it comes to music. Phenomenally moving. I wish I had a greater vocabulary, the better to impart to you just how INCREDIBLE this cd is....."
3,Where is it when we need it,The book is worth purchasing and could be used as an extension of a current practice. Getting believing clients would be the problem but a more people believe it becomes easier; worth the money
4,An Oxford Biography,"This text is most useful to readers who are interested in the Oxfordian theory of authorship but who may not quite be comfortable with it, for this text does what few others do: it presents the life of Oxford in striking detail, examining the events of his life without pushing too hard to make the point that Oxford, and not Shakspeare of Stratford, wrote the plays, poems, and sonnets. Whether one is convinced or not that Oxford is the true author of the works, the biography is illuminating, interesting, and necessary to research of Oxford's life; rather than centering on Oxford the poet, it describes Oxford the man, the husband, the lover, the courtier. Its chapters are structured year by year, and this organization makes it easier to examine the development of Oxford's life than many other Oxfordian texts which concentrate on proving the theory. It is not the most readable text, but a great resource."
2,REGULAR,"that i receive is not that they show in the picture, the turban style is diferent. I DONT LIKE IT."
3,OK,"I ordered this turban for when my hair looks awful and the turban is ok but too flat to the head. Just me, somebody else may love it. The style is fine and the material is easy care but not for me."
2,Navy Blue turban,Too small to replace a Sikh turban for casual wear. I had a seamstress put in a liner to give it more body
2,Not flattering on me,These did not flatter me at all. I had hoped I could use them for a badhair day but it just doesn't work for me. My face is too round. Am surethey would work and look great on someone else.
5,My favorite CD this year,"Combine the finest tenor voice in country music today, with an unerring choice of material, with great production, and what do you get? You get a CD that you won't be able to take out of your player for weeks. Fantastic!"
3,Twenty Years & Change,"There are several songs that almost feel like he's going back to his beginnings, and I enjoyed hearing those songs. I also like to hear how he's evolved over his career and I miss seeing him in concert to see him perform these songs live. I really enjoyed his take on some of the older songs on the album, he has a unique take on them and I it was quite entertaining."
1,This book is a disappointment,The author did not do a thorough job in making clear how she arrived at her answers to sample questions. The CD is not helpful. I sold my copy and bought Math for Meds: dosage and solutions by Anne Curren; it starts from the basic and proceeds to the complex with easy-to-follow examples.
2,Had to Puchase,"This book was required for a nursing class I took. I purchased it before the first class. When class started, we were told we where not going to use the book in class or for assignments but it would be good to have as a reference.... I didn't think it was of any help even as a reference...it was detailed way more than necessary! Took something simple and made two chapters out of it...but I will say the seller was excellent!!! ... Price was great (thankfully, since I didn't use it) compared to the college bookstore.Shipping was as promised!"
5,The Max on the Mini,It is an excellent book on the Mini Cooper. It has great photos and information.
4,I love my MINI!,"So, any book about the car I love can't be bad. Lots of detailed history and pictures. Wish there was more on what is to come, but that is of course very hard to do. Also a little les bias towards some of the development team would have been nice. Overall though it is worth the price even if just for the pictures alone!"
2,Sorry... not at all what I expected - and not in a good way.,"Someone else described it as ""lame"" - my first thought exactly. I had purchased the old 60's series, THE INVADERS with Roy Thinnes awhile back and it seemed to hold up better and pack a heftier punch than this thing. It was like Wally and the Beaver out having adventures with Eddie Haskell. X-Files, Millennium, even the short-lived Lone Gunmen were far more convincing, much more interesting and worthy of suspending disbelief."
3,At last,I was waiting for this release and at last it's here. I was very young when I first heard about MJ12 and years later in this show they mention all of the mythology around MJ12 I liked that and then I watched the series and I loved it. I think that it should have more extras but it's ok.
4,Dark Skies series,This item was given as a gift to my 40 year old son. It was on his Christmas list this year. I don't know if he has watched it yet but he thanked me for getting it for him.
5,I KNOW I WILL LOVE IT IF I EVER RECEIVE IT,The first shipment never arrived...the replacement shipment never arrived. I hope I will see it before EBE lands on the White House lawn? Amazon customer service has been fabulous thus far. Having to wait a month after due date is not a good thing in a foreign country. This country no longer allows vitamins through customs and I am sure some English speaking official is now enjoying the first shipment and his cousin is enjoying the second shipment. Perhaps Amazon could paste a false cover on the third shipment? Something like POLLYANNA or ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES might dissuade the third cousin?
4,SciFi collection,"I am very happy to have Dark Skies in my collection. It started to taper off a little toward the end and I can see - somewhat - the reasons for its being canceled. It is too bad though as I think it could have gone forward with a little tweaking. If you are a SciFi fan, you will enjoy this set."
2,To weird to use,The thought of the helmet sounded very cool...yeah speakers in the head phones...its a great idea...but the speakers are not so good!..you have to turn your mp3 player up really high in order to hear it well but the sound quality will be horrible....also the velcro it has inside the helmet for cushon....it really hurts when you take the helmet off because it tends to stick to your hair....I'm going to return it if I can.
2,not good,"very poor sound volume. i bought it cuz i couldn't find a review on it anywhere, or for that mattter in any shop now i know why, noone wants any association with it i assumeone redeeming quality, is that it's not huge & awkward feeling like some other brand helmet i got(sans the speakers)good idea, cant wait till they improve on iti guess i'll continue being a ""pod rider"" when i cant help but wanna listen to music & ride for hours on end"
4,Soft Mediterannean Breezes,"I shift into my easy chair and fire up the ole CD player, and ahhh, thank you Lee for instant translation to a sandy shore where sweet guitar is masterfully plucked. The keyboards rise and fall, but the melting, exotic Spanish-flavored six-string tells me, ""Relax, it's okay to . . ."""
3,Xmas with the Everly's,"Well, I found this album on record last Xmas - I love the Everly Brothers, and if you're like me, you'll want them singing Xmas songs to you when that time of year comes around. As far as albums go, well, it was probably cut in a few hours - no need to critique it, as far as Xmas albums go in general, this is pretty good fare - not a whole lot of energy in it, and in a way, it's pretty strange to hear their voices singing Xmas songs with a choir behind them - but that alone is worth the price of admission. Probably only for the true fan, or those who want some good quality Xmas music."
2,Everly Christmas CD,I purchased this CD based on other's review. It was less than what I was hoping for. The clear vocal sounds of the Everly Brothers just wasn't there as with their other CD. Not a bad CD but less than the sounds I was hoping for.
4,Great Buy!,"This was a very great way to make our talent show memorable.A group of me and my friends wore all black and taped this glowsticks to our bodies making us look like stick figures.Some of these broke when we snapped them, but most were very durable and lasted LONG!BLUE, PURPLE, and ORANGE DO NOT GLOW BRIGHT. GREEN, YELLOW, AND PINK ARE THE BRIGHTEST!!!"
2,Disappointed in the glow,"I purchased these glow sticks to wear to concerts that I attend with large groups of friends. It's a way to find everyone at the event. Our first show was last night. We activated our bracelets about 7pm (1 hour before show-time). We each wore 2 sticks connected as bracelets and out of the 8 bracelets, only 2 were still glowing after the show was over at 9:30pm. Had extra bracelets in my bag and we each put 2 more on...those were out by 11pm. I'm very disappointed to say that the least. The 8-12 hour claim in the description is nowhere close to the reality. Also, when my mom cracked on of her sticks, the stuff oozed out all over her hands. That glowed pretty nice until she washed it off. I also found that some of the sticks were glowing in spots before we even activated them and most had empty areas even after shaking. I guess why they were so reasonably priced...I kind of feel like they are a defective product. Bummer."
5,Dance Party Fun!,"I was looking for something to spice up our school dance, and this was it. The kids loved it! Thank you."
3,Acceptable but short lived,"The glow sticks arrived with nice packaging from the seller- but upon removing them from the carton, three broke and lit up while I was trying to sort them out into colors. I certainly wasn't being rough, but found this brand activates fairly easily. My friends and I use glow sticks about once a month for concerts (makes it really easy to find one another!) and this brand just didn't hold up as well as others. My main disappointment was that the sticks did not remain lit for long at all. By the end of the second set, some colors were totally dead, having only been activated a few hours beforehand. Not a bad rate, and great color/brightness when lit, but wish they lasted longer."
3,Kinda wimpy,When I received the tubes of glowsticks about 1/4 of them did not glow. Also there were not enough connectors to connect all of the bracelets. They also did not last very long or glow very brightly but served their purpose for a few good hours of fun.
4,Great for parties,Fun addition to a party. Kids love them. A little tricky to wrap around your wrist though.
1,Don't buy this dryer,"I bought this dryer 2 months ago, and even with light use, it has now quit working. Don't buy this - it's junk."
1,Worked for 3 months!,"This is the third Andis hang-up dryer I've had. The first two were great--worked for years. I bought this one on June 10, 2011. It lasted until September 8, 2011. It's too late to return it now of course. So I'm out the money and out of a hair dryer. Very disappointed!"
4,Replacement Unit,"This was bought to replace the same unit that had mysteriously stopped working after several years of heavy use. Obviously we like the performance and convienience of a wall mounted blow dryer. Nothing fancy, but handy."
5,A hair dryer for home that you will love!,"On the 2nd one of these and just love it. The first one lasted for about 10 years. So easy to use and keeps your bathroom counter clear of items just getting in the way. I mounted mine on the wall over the power outlet near the sink. Makes hair drying easy and is just what you need to help you get going in the morning after a shower. I like the way it mounts and is so easy to use, you will just love it once you get one for yourself."
5,Cool!,"Used it for about a year now, have had no problems! It was easy to install and works great! Keeps counter clear and is ready to use."
3,Does not remove from wall easily,"Great hairdryer, nice looking, powerful and easy to use. However, the mounting system is really bad. Once mounted, no easy way to take it down. When this puppy needs replacing you are going to do some serious damage to the dryer itself (which would be ok if you are throwing it out anyway) or possibly to the wall around the edges of the mounting system. It needs to be more readily removable for home users. I suppose hotels and such would suffer theft if it was really easy, so makes sense for them, but for home use it is just a hassle."
5,Great purchase!,"Having the counter space is a great plus, but Andis dryer has plenty of drying power so it does a great job and is light enough that drying your hair does not become a chore. I love the ability to just put the drying on the wall mount while it is still running and reposition my brush, then remove the dryer and never miss a beat. I have had one in my bathroom for 3 years and I just purchased two more, one for the guest bath and one for my housesitter for christmas because she too love this product."
2,Good Design but poor quality control,"I installed the first one 7 months ago. Worked fine for 6 months, then stopped working. Both the fan and heating coil were not operational. Took it apart and used my multimeter to see whether I could find out where was the problem. Not the GFCI, not the switch. The heating coil was still intact. No easy work around. My daughter likes this dryer. I bought another unit from Amazon. The new one made clicking noise when I was installing it. Took it apart and saw a piece of white plastic inside. It was not broken off from the dryer itself. Seem to be a random piece included as ""bonus for returning customer"". Will see how long this second one last. It is not likely I'll bought the third one."
1,Should be a Zero rate,"Andis 33295 Hangup Pro Turbo 1600W Wall Mount Hair DryerMotor would not start. Thus returned.This is my 3rd Andis as I love wall mount type in my bathrooms. Previous 2 did not last very long. Found there are other brands and therefore, changing."
1,useless at best,"This book is pretty useless unless you already know how to do everything in it. Explanations are very lacking, at best. There are very few example problems, which are not related to the questions or even helpful. The only positive aspect of this book that I can think of is that it ""could"" be useful as a reference book.. If you are using this book to learn the material, I would strongly recommend finding another source."
2,Not enough here,"I am a student attempting to learn statics for the first time. I prefer examples that start simple, working to a higher level of complexity, and don't combine too many theories at once. This book seems to move at a faster pace than allows me to really grasp the individual concepts as they are presented. Each topic needs more attention to individual details. I wish there were more sample problems, with direct refrences to the text as to how the theories were applied. I'm having a hard time laying down a mental foundation with so few examples. To its credit, it is in color, and illistrations are easy to read."
2,The book is not helpful at all.,"This book is horrible. The examples are not helpful and there are only one or two per problem set. Also, the text is hard to follow. The only good part about the book is that it has some challenging and interesting problems. If I didn't have such an awesome professor, I wouldn't be able to do them based on the information in the book alone. This is a subject where good examples can make all the difference in understaning the material. The book simply doesn't get it done."
2,Horrible Read,"This book is very difficult to read and has too few examples per topic. The problems also have a very steep curve, from easy, to rediculously hard very quick. If it weren't for all my friends and I coming together to work on the material, we would be no where."
1,Useless brick,"This textbook is the worst I have ever read, and it is so horrible that it inspired me at 4 AM to come and write this review. A key element in learning Statics, which makes heavy use of FBD's, is to see many examples of how forces act so that one can internalize how to determine how they act. This text, however, has the worst examples which are hardly related to the problems given later on. I find it funny how those who liked this book generally claim they had a good instructor: I have a theory that the textbook is utter garbage and those people learned the material well beforehand from their instructor before cracking open this book. If at all possible, this book is junk, so find something else to study from if your lecturer sucks. I have never encountered such an unreadable, unhelpful book in my science/engineering classes from high school to university (and I am at Berkeley; other students here have made their disgust with this book known...) Avoid at all costs!"
1,AWFUL,"There are some bad books on the market, but this is by far the worst. Examples are too few and far between, and problems are almost impossible to decipher at times. I have also yet to meet a student who actually likes this book."
1,THE BOOK SUCKS ASS!!!!!,This book is undoubtedly the worst study book in the history of the world ever to be printed... Its assigned in the freshman year and if ur instructor sucks a bit then you are in a lot of trouble.. cant understand a single word written in this book... get another book tis one is useless
3,Shattered,"Excited ,happy,eager,pumped, all words i would use to describe how i felt when i heard showbiz was doing a new mixtape.Shattered,disappointed,sad and let down was how i felt when i heard it. From production point of view this album is ok (not great like runaway slave) but average.Its the mcs that really let this album down.Every song about guns ice and b$@ches.I mean come on are we still listening to this crap.HELL NO (at least im not anyway!)I just dont want to hear this played out recycled hip hop any more.Show needs to go back to the lab with AG and just create another classic with hard beats and ill rhymes.As a DITC collector ill still probably buy this but i would reccommend u spend the hard earned $ on Pumpkinhead -Orange moon over brooklyn or Akrobatik balance and hear hip hop in its purest form.Peace."
3,For history buffs only,"After reading the reviews here, and saw they were mostly positive, I decided to take the plunge and order my copy, since I'm an old (literally) Kansas fan. After toiling through the album, I'm rather torn on how to review it. For hardcore fans that like to hear how the band evolved from one Kansas to the next, you'll probably love it. Myself, it's a little too 'avant-garde' in almost all tracks. Where the music would be flowing smoothly one moment, the next is interrupted by clashing instruments and strange generated sounds. Kansas finding it's path, indeed. If you can handle a sudden change in musical direction mid-song, then you'll be able to handle this album. Otherwise...."
4,Proto-Kaw: Early Recordings from Kansas 1971-1973,"I liked this CD...bought it after I read the Rolling Stone review on 10/03/02...sounds somewhat like the Kansas we know of..but much more ""british"" progressive rock sounding. I think the music will appeal to prog rockers and Kansas fans alike."
4,"It's not ""Dust In the Wind""","I read the review of this cd in Rolling Stone 10/03/02 so I bought it. It is great stuff...somewhat different than the Kansas we know, but similar enough that Kansas fans will like it. Much more ""british"" sounding than the Kansas US Rock n' Roll music. Prog fans will really like this one!"
5,Perfect for everyday use,"Love this stuff. It provides good protection and doesn't leave hands greasy, and although I usually prefer unscented lotions such as Lubriderm, the scent is so light and fresh I love it."
2,"Fun examples of ""transitive design"" surrounded by pretentious rambling","Fun examples of ""transitive design.""Pretentious design rambling. Mostly BS.Here's a sample sentence:""Nevertheless, looking even more closely at the intense work of theoretical elaboration and support that has always characterized the history of Italian design, with a body of very precise, effective critical contributions, the need to adapt to the emerging transitive condition would appear somewhat less urgent.""Castelli needs an editor and... and a lucid story."
3,Would have worked better with a smaller page size,"While as with most Putnam books, there is a wealth of information that has never before been published in the West, the larger page format that Putnam adopted for its later books simply does not work well here.Putnam's earlier books, with their 8-3/4 x 5-3/4 page size, were much better at presenting the data in ""encyclopedic"" books like this one; the larger page size should be reserved for books with a running narrative. At the very least, the three-column-per-page format should be replaced with one or two columns.I hope that, if someone puts the Putnams back in print, that they re-format this book, and similar Putnams with encyclopedic listings of aircraft, in the 8-3/4 x 5-3/4 page size, which would make this book much more pleasant to use!"
3,Not what I expected,"First off I am not a long time Scott listener,I came across Chipped Front Tooth in a bargan bin and really liked this cd. So I bought Revelator looking for the same hard driven rocken/blues tempo thats just not there, except for a couple songs"
1,No ink!,"This could have been a good little setup, but since they no longer make ink for this machine, why would you buy it?"
1,NOT for Ipod Touch / NOT a charger,"It does not work with the Ipod Touch with the wireless adapter (as both ""holes are on the same side, the plug and the usb) and also it is not charger as they say, only a transmitter.. Do not waste your money on it It does not worth it!! too expensive for the use."
3,FM transmitter its not charger,"The remote control is good because it is wireless technology, is not necessary to aim at the equipment. The bad thing was the FM transmitter, because it is not charger as they say, single is transmitting."
5,Great book! Worth it!,"I am have a 4 year old Autistic boy. At the time I read this book,my son was only 3 and the tips were awesome. I had such good results. He was potty trained in 2 wks! Seriously! The book looks at a very tense subject/issues from a very therapeutic and somewhat relaxing way. It's a great read and very helpful to any parent! Especially a special needs child. It also gives you a great perspective of what your child is thinking. That really changed the way I approached my son. Great book!"
5,Francais Fantastique - C'est HIP!!,"This CD is by far my best buy of 2004. If you like mood music that puts you into a lounge/disco bar in France, this is for you. It is perfect for anytime when ultra hip international music is called for. EVERY song is nearly a masterpiece and tres romantique!"
3,RougeRouge,I heard a cut on a Putumayo CD and thought that I'd buy a Rouge Rouge CD. It changed the recording I heard on the other CD and the other cuts were just okay.
4,Pleasing at the Source of Genius,"Honestly, I have not listened to this album in its entirety; however, my initial evaluation of selected songs would have to be extremely amicable for this mixture of ethereal sound. Track 3 stands out as an obvious favorite with a peculiar name, translation from French: ""You decide."" With a driving toms rythm, this song exhibits an extremely unique texture with an overtone of chorus dillating vocals and nearly techno-esque programming (If you listen to Thievery Corporation, you'll love this song). Other than that, track 10 is more of a driving beat but is attractive nonetheless. On a wholistic note, the entire album may not be worth buying (note: I haven't listened to the entire thing), yet the album exhibits the potential of Rouge Rouge's seductive talent."
4,Betsy solves another,"A bit slow at first but moves along quite well after the first few chapters. Even non-needlework savy readers will find this book will catch their interest. The character of Betsy Devonshire continues to develope nicely, as do the others in her small community. This tale is of an old unsolved crime that continues to cast its' shadow on a prominent businessman. Betsy takes on the task of clearing up the rumors and solving the crime. The ending isn't original but Monica Ferris does an excellent job of making it a believable one. Ms. Ferris storytelling improves with each book."
3,Not a lot of action,"While I've enjoyed the previous books in this series, this one seemed slow and lacking in suspense. Perhaps it was because the murders in question take place several years before the present. The non-mystery aspects of the book (Betsy's romance) also seemed flat, and characters from previous books could have used more 'screen time'."
1,what?!,"What in the world is Mr.Gramm trying to say?!! He is one of those annoying people who fancy themselves philosophers and find it necessarry to inflict their views on others. What is his problem, anyway? He wanders so far afield that I would like to see Gettysburg National Park sue him for something....anything!!! How did he get away with using the park's good name to sell this book?....isn't here a law against such a thing?Half way through reading it I would have sworn the it was written by Mr.Kimblel from ""Green Acres"" If you can follow Mr. Gramms' thought process you need more help than I {or anyone else} can give you.If you need to understand the meaning of Gettysburg just read Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. If you would like a more technical work on warefare and how it is fought and why Gettysburg was so costly read ""Carnage & Culture"" by Victor Davis Hanson."
2,A disappointment,There is a reason why meditations are silent. Mr. Gramm should have remained so! The work as a history is informative; however when the author waxes on societal meanings and generational comparisons he should have been waxing his car instead.
5,"It answers the question ""What can I cook in thirty minutes?""","The recipes in this book are so easy to follow that anyone can create a tasty, healthy and good looking meal in a matter of minutes. It is great for those people who are so busy that they think they have to ""order in"" to get a good meal. I recommend this book to everyone."
3,great album,"as we got closer to the mid 70s the climax blues band started to get a bit better with a bit more of a heavy rockin edge, this record was regarded as one of there best next to platted in 1976, still my favorite is whole lot of bottle from 1970. great album here though, as well as a great japan mini lp sleeve replica...."
4,worked beautifully,wonderful color and uniformity of the roll. Worked very nicely for a back splash design in my kitchen. Much better pricing than most.
1,waste of time,"Gee. This book's so badly written, I can't imagine how it got published. The plot's derrivative and predictable. The characterization is worse. The ""high tech"" backdrop is horribly researched, and not all that whiz bang. They'll probably make it into a movie."
2,Can't believe 5 stars...,"I had to balance these folks who are giving out ***** reviews willy-nilly. The gentleman who complained about the ubermensch characters hit on the head one of the several nails in this book's coffin. Others include the very predictable plot, the insignificance of the technology (which was supposed to be the core of the whole thing), and some places where my disbelief was unwilling to suspend itself.I gave it the extra star from my 1 for 2 reasons: the writing was not so poor that I couldn't finish it, and the technology, while not central, at least was for the most part plausible and correct. That's always a plus, even more so since Grace avoided a heavy ""gee-whiz"" factor that often accompanies mainstream use of technical gimmickry.And I was glad I got it at a serious discount..."
2,Internet Farce,"I bought this book thinking that it would be better than Tom Clancy's attempt at Internet terrorism. Alas it was just as bad, with simplistic technology twists, and the reliance of a Navy Seal character for the tense action. The story is simple, with nothing in it other than a sense of purpose to keep you turning the page. If you want a decent techno-thriller I recommend the Cryptonomicon. This is squarely for the younger audience who are still wanting to read simple tales with simple characters."
3,Spyder Web,"The beginning to Spyder Web was somewhat confusing, but the action scenes kept me interested. The techno-stuff was intriguing and since I'm not techno-literate I was willing to accept whatever Tom presented. When the story line began to fall into place the novel moved more quickly, however when the love interest appeared it bogged down and the dialogue became sappy. And the ending... well, I thought I had mistakenly picked up my wife's latest Nora Roberts novel. Still, I'm waiting for the next Grace adventure. I may wait for the paperback."
4,A very enjoyable read...,"I found this to be a very enjoyable read. Although the plot was complex, the author did a nice job of bringing everything together. Being in the IT business, I found the references to technology interesting. However, if you are not in the least interested in technology, the references may not sit so well. But if you can overlook that, the story itself is pretty good and well worth the read."
2,"Show is great, but video quality is below sub par","My wife and I never missed an episode of this show when it originally aired and could not wait to pick up the DVD. Went out and picked it up today, popped it in my DVD, fired up the plasma and yikes an old VHS tape looks better than this. Nothing was done to clean this up for the DVD and by todays standards this is almost unwatchable. Universal did a much better job on the DVD transfer of the almost decade older Magnum PI series. CBS/Paramount should be ashamed, Wings deserves better."
5,it's about time,"what took so long to finally bring this wonderfully hysterical comedy series out on dvd, especially when there are a lot of shows out here that are not even as well done as wings and are not even half as funny.what happened to good taste? well bravo to the idividuals that be that made the decision to bring it out. when i buy the series, i'm going to take the day off, invite a couple of friends over, make a big bowl of pop corn, slip it in to the dvd player,and plan to laugh out loud."
3,Waited too long for this result,I remember a couple of years back I emailed nbc and asked them when wings would be out on dvd and I got some really lame answer about market trends and whatever. Now cbs video releases this and to do such a horrible job with it. I saw a knockoff dvd of a few episodes that had better image quality. Its like cbs copies them on a home computer from a vcr or something. Very Very disappointed
5,Excited!,"Well, it's finally coming. I will be on vacation when Wings is released. I'm gonna pack my DVD player and go out and buy it first thing that morning."
1,Video Quality: Minus 2 Stars; Series Plus 5 Stars,Why did CBS Video bother with 4 discs? Why not compress the whole series onto 1 disc; it wouldn't have looked much worse.
5,Great Series,Loved the series and the subplots it had in each episode. The epidode 'Plane 9 From Nantucket' was precious. I laughed my head off when they were in the plane and the passengers put on foil hats and had light bulbs in their mouths. Thanks to X-files for the inspiration.
4,Wings - Finally!,"One of the best series in television finally came to DVD. No extras, which resulted in my review dropping down one star, but, if you are a fan of the series, you can finally catch it again. And, I can now free up about 50 hours on my Tivo!"
5,Simply a terrific series!,"I love Wings.... Even though I have seen many of these episodes several times on television, I thoroughly enjoyed watching again! This sitcom has a superb cast and very talented writing. I know that as the years pass, I will revisit this collection many times over. I am looking forward to the release of additional seasons. I would highly recommend Wings!"
5,One of my favorite sitcoms,"Wings is one of my all-time favorites. I pre-ordered the DVD set and have no complaints. I wish they had included some extras but I have been waiting so long for this show to be released, that I am happy to just have the episodes. Hopefully, this set will sell well enough that the studio will add some extras and improve the quality on future season sets. It's like revisiting with old friends."
2,Poor Quality,"I love Wings the show, but Wings the DVD is horrible! As other reviewers have stated, the picture quality equals that of a home-made VHS tape. What's a VHS tape?... I'm waiting for it to come out on Blu-Ray, so should you.P.S. Crystal Bernard is BABELICIOUS!"
4,Wings - Seasons 1 & 2,"I was unable to find this dvd in any of the stores that I shop and was very happy when I found it available at Amazon.com.Wings was always one of my favorite series; at one point, I stopped watching Jeopardy so I could watch Wings in sydication.This dvd is contains many cleaver scripts and its loaded with laughs. I would say this is a must item for anyone's TV series collection."
4,Terrific DVD - one caveat,"I can't add too much to the other reviews - I very much enjoyed the DVD. (I just finished watching the last show tonight.) It's a terrific ensemble cast with some very sharp writing in some of the shows. If you like an ensemble show, like Cheers, you are sure to like Wings.But it boggles my mind that they decided to put Tony Shaloub on the cover. Maybe he is introduced later but in this DVD, in season one and two, he makes one appearance in one show, as a waiter. He's terrific, but putting him on the cover was distracting - I kept waiting for his character to be introduced and come work at the airport or something and then...the season was over! This review should serve as a warning to other Shaloub fans - he only appears in one show on this DVD. That said, its a great DVD and I am glad I bought it."
2,What a disappointment!,"The show gets 5-stars easily. I've waited for years for this and was thrilled when it was finally announced it would be released. I ordered in advance and and felt like a kid waiting for Christmas! When I put it in the DVD player and started it, I was, well, surprised...unhappily surprised. The video quality is out and out POOR; it reminds me of a worn out VHS tape. Video quality aside, there's no special features, not even subtitles for the hearing impaired. As for the cover artwork, I've seen better work from kids off their home computers. Disappointing all the way 'round."
1,Good show if you like hitting yourself in the head with cinder blocks,I was offended by the lameness of Wings. I personally know of two individuals who died while watching this show. 100% of me will consider it 0% fun. I'd rather take a bath with a week-long dead possum than sit through this dvd.
5,FROG VASE,I AM REALLY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT LOOKS GREAT WITRH THE OTHER TOBY ITEAMS AND LOOKS GREAT WITH FLOWERS IN IT.
5,at last an easy to read professional chord system,I've played and studied for years and KARL ARANJOS chord system is about the finest out there. If you're serious about learning the art of chords you seriously need to buy this book. Highly reccommended
3,Very sugary and sweet power pop!,"This is the epitome of power pop! So sugary sweet, killer hooks, irresistable harmonies.It is very enjoyable yet, the songs do not make as big of an impact as other bands (that I feel) are better at this form of music. They do not compare with a Fountains of Wayne, Big Star, The Shoes. Maybe it is because the songs are not that edgy, they are more Brian Wilson then Beatles' Revolver.The above is over analyzing an otherwise very fine cd. ""Kind of like a Star"" is absolutely beautiful. It is a perfect power pop song. ""Don't forgot your man"" is a fun, quality tune (but it sounds very derivative of something I can't quite put my finger on). ""Meteorite"" is another highlight.I think that this band is more of a one man band/very heavily influenced by Steve Ward. I also bought his solo work and this is superior.In the world of ""power pop"", I would rate this above average. It won't knock your socks off but there are some great songs on it."
3,COMR,"Very nice watch. My wife loves it, but over time the only problem has been the clasp that adjusts the band. It has loosened to the point that it does not stay long and has necessitated many adjustments. This is now going to force me to lower my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars."
4,A great introduction to this little known emperor,My children and I found this book fascinating and full of factual information. There is little written at this level about this man who had such an influence in connecting the west with the east. Reading this interesting and detailed overview will make you want to read more. I couldn't disagree more with the negative editorial review.
2,A jaunt thru mariage therapy,"This is a book a bit hard to define for it is of littel use to beginners or the experienced therapists. It is like overhearing a married couple take about their work with couples. There are a few redeeming thoughts on rituals but the rest is light on theory, tactics, case histories or clincial work with couples. keep looking."
2,Andis Blow Dryer,"bought as Xmas gift for wife, matched the 1600 kw of our previous Andis blow dryer. But it lacked the blowing power alot. The light was also very bright on the wall mount, had we kept it I was going to remove the light. Did not meet our expectations, so i returned the item to Amazon."
3,Not as powerful as I thought it would be,"A fairly good hairdryer although not very powerful - but adequate for my purposes. The first one I received didn't work at all and had to be returned. This one works fine, but was a little difficult to install. I love the night light - it is very bright, but one can always close the bathroom door if it's bothersome. I would purchase this item again."
4,Nice hairdryer - good power,We installed in RV - up out of the way but good power - the night light is nice feature for us.
1,Disappointment,"After using the dryer (which I liked very much and did a quick job), I discovered that my hair was being ruined. It would break off in small 2 inch curved pieces.I stopped using it for a month and confirmed that was the problem because the lavatory was no longer filled with broken pieces of hair.I would like to return it and get my money back!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"first hairdryer arrived damaged, second hairdryer only lasted five months before overheating. Now what, I have no box to return the item but I am going to let the company know my dissatisfaction with their product and see what happens. I'm going back to Conair!"
3,"Looks & works good, minor flaws","Works well, looks good on wall. Night light is creepy and too bright and should be wired to a light sensor so it goes off in daylight. Easy fix is to hit the GFI ""test"" button to shut it off.Mounting system is absolute garbage, plastic wall anchors provided are useless-they spin in the wall or fall right thru as their is no flange or lip. Had to use my own anchors with heavier screws. Have seen several reviews about this ...can't believe they still don't spring the additional $.30 to fix this issue. Once mounted, tho, it works well and is way better than having a dryer kicking around the sink, floor, etc."
2,Andis Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light,"I really thought that a product with ""turbo"" in its description would pump out more air. It produces adequate air flow and is quiet but quite heavy. If I knew then what I know now, I would buy the smaller, lighter dryer."
4,Wall mountable is good,"We own a new condo in St. Maarten and because we will be renting it, we felt that having a secure and space saving hair dryer would be most practical yet beneficial to our guests. The smaller model was installed in the guest bathroom and this larger one in the Master bath. The night light feature on this model is a little brighter than the other model we purchased as well but still is really not something that would really be considered a night light so that's why I did not give it 5 stars. It serves it's purpose and so we were pleased. The power on this model is just a little stronger but not much more compared to the smaller version we purchased as well.[...]"
4,easy to install,"Easy to install, nice nightlight. Don't use the template. Remove and Use the plate to determine the location for screw holes."
3,1 light made it lose teo more stars,"I'm only giving this item 3 stars because the night light does not work. My contractor installed it for me; however, as far as the hair dryer itself ggoes, I'd give it 5 stars! Every woman should have this one in her bathroom, It's handy, neat because of the cord storage, snd really works fine. I'm hoping by the time I have my other bath done, it will be made in beige. I like to co-ordinate my colors."
5,Great Hair Dryer unit,"Shipped and arrived within estimated time. My husband installed it the same day and found installation very easy. I do have to agree with others that the night light is quite bright. I do partially close the door to our Master bath because of the light, since our bathroom is connected to our bedroom. No complaints about using the hair dryer. It is certainly quieter than our other one. Would definitely purchase another."
4,Andis 30975 1600W Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light,"My wife and I have been very satisfied with the dryer so far. Each of us uses it every day. It isn't as quiet as we had hoped, but it's still fairly quite. More importantly - it works fine and that is the main thing. Couple of points. NOTE 1: The night light is pretty powerful and stays on all the time, night or day. Not a big deal to us. NOTE 2: Installing it was a bit of a hassle, especially if you do not have a screwdriver with a magnetic tip, as you have to thread each of 2 screws through two mounting brackets, and the screws kept falling out. I finally gave up on one screw, but the dryer is still secure on the wall. NOTE 3: This dryer is a replacement for another wall-mounted unit that just died in less than 2 years. We have had this one about 3 months - so the verdict is still out on its lifespan..."
2,ridiculous mounting system,"having owned a couple of the predecessors of this dryer, which were always quite satisfactory, I find this ""newly"" designed mounting system to be a poor excuse for a mounting bracket. The screws meant to hold the dryer to the bracket are totally inadequate..too small to withstand the torsion of removing and replacing the dryer on the bracket. I can't imagine how much was saved by changing to this style, but it certainly leaves a bad taste for the overall quality of the dryer."
1,Do not buy this!,"Hair dryer was purchased in mid-January, it quit working in less than 30 days.It was purchased to replace an Andis that looked identical and worked for 5 years.This model has a switch to change from 1200 Watts to 1600 Watts. An hex wrench is needed tomake this change, but is not included with the dryer. The previous model also had a ""cool"" buttonwhich this model does not have.Now the dryer has to be shipped to Wisconsin for repair...."
2,Below Avrage,"I purchased two of these Andis 30975/HD-10L 1600W Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light. The product is difficult to install as the back plate is hard to align, and comes with the tiniest screws. Also, the manufacturer ships the product with the cheapest wall anchors. I had to purchase expandable Mollys to properly anchor the dryer to the drywall. Once installed I discovered that the night light does not work on one of the dryers, and the night light is not replaceable. It's too much trouble to take it down, repackage the product and take it to the post office, so we'll keep it.Andis 30975/HD-10L 1600W Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light"
2,Electrical hazard?,"Installed hairdryer for use in our motorhome. Attached to wall surface and plugged in to nearby electrical outlet. After several hours, we began to smell an ""electrical"" odor. Upon investigation, we discovered that the hairdryer (around the nightlight area) was SO hot that we could not touch it. In fact, it was so hot that it actually blistered the plastic housing around this area. We immediately unplugged it and have requested a replacement. But we will be watching this item very closely for the the first few days. We had not read any reviews before ordering that indicated this kind of probem, so we are hopeful that just this one was wired incorrectly. I will post a follow-up review in the future"
4,Very handy and neat,This hair dryer is quiet and does a good job. We bought it because we liked the ones at motels and timeshares we had seen and wanted one like them. The night light is quite bright(almost too bright for us). The air flow is quiet and does a good job but does not offer separate heat/ air controls. Overall we are pleased with it.
1,30 day max use,They last only about 30 days. Only using about 15 mins a day. this is the second one. I will not buy again.
5,new dryer,my wife loves it and the night light is very nice. she uses it every day and finds it really works good
4,Does all I had hoped.,Does all that I had hoped......helps to declutter my vanity top and dries my hair. As for the night light....I find that a plus....soft glow in the whole vanity area.
3,Its compact!!!,"Great compact design. I love the cord hanger. The light is pretty bright, but exactly as advertised. It does take longer to dry my hair-but it is doing less damage...."
4,great dryer,"I bought this for my daughters' to use in their bathroom. It is out of the way and no cords on the counter. The green night-light is bright, but the girls like it since it brightens the bathroom up at night! They can remove/replace the dryer by themselves (they are 5 and 10 years old). They don't have to squeeze anything to remove it. Just gently pull. It is quiet with high/low speeds. I did NOT use the anchors/screws that came with the kit. Since I had young girls who would be pulling the dryer off of the wall and may not be so gentle, I replaced those with drywall toggle bolts. It is nice that the GFI is built into the unit and not on the plug so that the plug does not block an outlet or have to plug into the bottom outlet only. I recommend this product. Only reason for 4 stars is because of the hardware they sent with it. There is no way I can see those screws and anchors staying in the wall with people pulling on the dryer to remove it!"
2,Shuts off when it gets hot,"I have owned two of these units. I threw the first one away when, after running it on hot, it could not be restarted until the unit cooled down. Chalking it up as a defect, I purchased another unit. Same thing. The new unit simply shuts down when on high-hot. I don't want to wait until a hair dryer cools down to use it two consecutive times. I cannot recommend this unit."
2,Great Concept- Poor Quality,"We have a small bathroom and the hair dryer never got put away so it was always in the way. So... I did a lot of research and settled on this product. I figured, OK, they make commercial products so this should be decent.My first one began to make a noise like the fan was loose and got to the point where it was unusable. It was under warranty, so I sent it back. They replaced it no problem. Occasionally you get a lemon, that is why we have warranties.Well.. It has been less than a year and the replacement hairdryer is now making the same noise. It is going to die. I will try to send it back again, but it is hardly worth the effort. I promise there is nothing unusual going on here. Too bad it is not made better, we really liked it."
1,no warranty,"night light went out after 2 months, i found out the warranty was only for 1 month..... this is a good product but the warranty sucks.I am going for a full refund through American Express.. not through Amazon .lost in the woods..."
4,Andis 30975 1600W Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light,"It's been great so far, and quiet. I like it very much!"
2,switch broke,"hair dryer worked good for about 1 year. Then the switch broke, fused in the open position.I would not buy an Andis product again."
3,"Not satisfied - No Cool Mode, Difficult to Mount","It's a quiet, and adequate hair dryer. Looks good in the day time.But also have the following critical problems:- No cool mode, that is different from Amazon's description as having ""cool shot styling feature""- Mounting hardware is a joke. Very difficult to align and install. After installed, it just does not have enough strength to survive year of use.Minor issue about night light: color does not look good, and does not turn off in day time."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"I have thick hair that is cut into a bob. This is exactly what I was looking for in a dryer. It has high and low settings and it also has 1400 and 1600 adjustable settings. I chose to keep mine on 1400 and it dries my hair in minutes. It is also perfect for styling my hair as i do the final drying. I love the convenience of having it mounted on the wall out of the way. It does have a nice night light that is bright, but I count that as a plus for early morning trips to the bathroom when you aren't ready for a regular light."
2,disappointed,"We were very disappointed with this hair dryer. We've had one before and really liked it. This one is very noisy. Maybe it's a lemon. That's the chances you take buying online, but we couldn't find this hair dryer in the stores."
3,Good Night Light,"The reviews are true on this one. The night light is VERY bright! I was disappointed in the power of the hair dryer. It looks nice on the wall, but just can't perform. I would recommend a more powerful model. Andis does have good customer service, so I would choose their brand again, but would spend more for a better wall mounted hair dryer."
4,a good product,This is a good product at a good price. I wish for more choices high/medium/low power and heat but it does a real good job and the night light has been a bonus for our guests
3,Andis Hangup Hair Dryer,"Good quality product and easy to install. The one major issue is the fan speed on ""HI"" is not acceptable. In fact, it is more like a medium speed."
3,Hair Dryer,Hair dryer hangs nicely on the wall; could be more powerful. I am not crazy about the 'green' night light.
3,johnfromwisconsin,Yes it is quiet but it in turn lacks air flow volume.Very disappointed in the air flow and also the hand held unit is to large for small amount of air flow?? I have had smaller unit and they had alot more air flow. I guess if you want a quiet unit your going to have to sacrifice air flow but I still can't figure out why hand unit has to be so large?? Also the hi/off/low switch if touched alittle it will move to the off position.Alot of people comment the night light is to bright but I think it's just fine.Also cord hang up knob is GREAT!!! Sorry but overall this would be a bad choice.
2,disappointed,"I've wanted a hangup dryer for a long time, when we put in a new bathroom, I decided on the hangup. I bought this in black. It looked good but I couldn't believe how long it was taking to dry my hair. I finally gave up and got my old one out and finished drying my hair in less than 30 sec. I sent it back and bought another hangup dryer (1875W from Andis). The construction is not as nice but drying time is fast."
1,Poor wall mount system,"I would NOT recommend this item, the wall mounting system is poor. The screws utilized to mount dryer to the wall bracket failed on the first turn. Additionally, the night light stopped working after 1 day."
3,Andis 30975/HD-10L wall hanging hair dryer,Used one of these in a hotel and decided the convenience of hanging a hair dryer on a wall and the way it performed warranted buying one. It works fine but with not as much power as I expected. However the biggest drawback and what would prevent me from ever buying this again is the terrible task to mount it on the wall. The mounting plate goes on easily but then the plastic piece that holds the hair dryer has to be attached to the plate. The holes are very tiny and deep and the screws are super short and tiny making it nearly impossible to match up. I finally had to search for screws that would be tiny but long enough to sink into the drywall behind the plate.[[ASIN:B0009XH6WI Andis 30975/HD-10L 1600W Quiet Hangup Hair Dryer with Night Light
5,Easy to install,I've only had the product a short time and purchased it to install in my guest bathroom. I had a guest visiting from England for three weeks and she loved it! She said it was better than most she has encountered in 1st class hotels. I'm surprised how quiet it is.
1,No Powe Hair dryer,This hair dryer is vey poor..... I have portaable hair dryers with the same 1600 watts and this one does not even come close to the power of my portable....I am very disappointed. I will not order again....
2,dave1327,the dryer is to hard to remove and replace into it's cradle. Also it is not powerful enough.
4,Hair Drier w/ Night light,"This drier works very well mounts easily, comes with template, It has two power settings as well as two heat settings. One power setting is for lower heat rating 1200 watts the other is for 1600 watts. The night light is bright and useful. It is on all the time no photocell or switch, the only drawback."
5,Great Hairdryer,"This little hairdryer is great and it does not take up very much space on the wall. I love the cord hook; keeps the cord out of the way when not in use. I only have one recommendation for this product, I wish there was an off button for the night light!"
1,Two Quit Working in Less than Two Months,"I bought the first one and hung it on the wall in my guest bathroom. Within two months, it went dead. Bought a second identical one and it went dead in the same period of time with no one using it. Too bad because I really liked the light and it worked great when it worked."
2,Disappointed,"Had the hair dryer 6 months kept it clean from lint and it worked very well, after 6 months of use it burned-up, I know it's probably under warranty, but who wants to fool with it."
2,Weak,"Based on mostly positive reviews I purchased this hair dryer - usually the reviews on Amazon are on target - not this time. This dryer appears to be well built and fits the space on my wall fine but has two major flaws that make me regret my decision to purchase:1. The night light is way too bright.2. More importantly, the air flow on the high setting is woefully inadequate for me!!! Trying to dry my hair each morning during this hot summer has been no fun with this hair dryer barely pushing very hot air at me. It usually leaves me sweating with semi-dry hair.I hate to waste hard earned money, but I'm looking at trashing this unit and finding a replacement (I used to have a Sunbeam model that worked great).Good luck shopping!"
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this blow dryer. After reading the good reviews about it, I thought it would be a safe purchase. Wrong. First: The hardware to mount it to the wall is flimsy and hard to work with. Tiny little screws. Second: it is very underpowered. The best thing about it is the nightlight. Bright enough so you don't have to turn another bathroom light on in the middle of the night. I did get 2 of them and they were on sale at the time so I kept them. I won't buy one of their products again."
1,OVER HEATS!!!!!!!!!,"After two months it just keeps overheating! Filter is clean but constantly shuts off. I have very short thin hair and this hair dryer has to cool down at a minimum of three times before I can dry my hair. Not very powerful, a waist of money and another item sent to the land fill."
4,Full of wisdom and insight,"i just finished reading this book... what a page turner it was. i really enjoyed every bit of it and the cd that follows. though i am single, both the book and cd really assure me that GOD does have someone special for everyone; these items gave me a lot of insight on what NOT to do to the husband that GOD has for me........ i recommend any and everyone to read this book."
5,Everything you need to know about Christian marriage,"Every married couple who wants to have a biblically based relationship, OR single people or even engaged people who want to same need to read this book. Juanita Bynum and her husband tell it like it is (the cd that accompanies the book is an in your face, slightly racy in the sweetest way at times smack in the forehead for those who need to ""get it"")"
4,Great Book for Engaged Couples,"I would recommend this for particularly couples that are engaged. My husband and I gained much insight and wisdom from this book, in fact, much more than what our 11 week pre-marital counseling offered."
3,Very interesting book,I thought the book was really interesting and it opened my eyes to alot of things. Some parts in the book I had no idea what he was talking about and other parts really stood out to me. As I read on I was thinking about the recent situation with him and his wife. He wrote things about you should never hit a woman and as a man how to walk away when a woman is angry and I wondered......why didn't he take his own advice? I'm not judging just a thought I guess. In the book he made their marriage sound so great and perfect but the recent events made it look like a lie. I guess no one is perfect huh?
4,Inspired Materials,I have been pleased with the material in the book The Threshing Floor.I have not gottened into the other book yet.I was pleased with the speedy time in which I did received the materials.The condition of both boooks was just as it stated on line.
5,I THOUGHT I knew,This book is very anointed. I thought I knew how to love. I thought I was ready for marriage. I thought I knew what marriage was. NOPE. I REALLY DIDN'T. This book changed my life and made me realize how to be a Proverbs 31 woman and minister to my husband. It also taught me that marriage is beautiful and a gift from God. I know now that my marriage won't be hell on earth that everyone says it is. I will have a blessed marriage and a blessed husband. This book has given me HOPE!!!
5,If you like Celtic/Rock you can safely buy this CD'unheard'.,"Their first album was good enough for me to risk buying this one 'unheard'. I played this CD at least half a dozen times back to back before giving it a rest. If you like this Celtic/Rock thing you'll not tire of this album. This band is obviously about one thing:Fun. There are even somebody's kids on this CD putting the boot in....it's fun and really fine hard music. Clearly a labor of love.I'll definitly be buying their next CD. Edmund, Orlando."
1,critic at large,"While this disc should be a welcome addition to the Yma Sumac catalogue (it has two of her 1943 recordings from Argentina) the masters used are scratchy, so the entire recording has very bad static and background noise. I recommend Queen of Exotica, which has the greatest number of the Argentina recordings (9), as well as an excellent representation of Ymas 1950's work (45 songs on 2 discs). The sound quality on Queen is flawless as well!"
5,Wonderful Children's story,I loved this book as a child and read it repeatedly. As a teacher I picked it up and read it aloud to my third graders and they were mesmerized.
3,Paul Gallico,The description was accurate and the book arrived promptlyWhat more could I have asked?
4,$15 per issue is a rip.,You can easily pick this up at most major book stores for $5-8 dollars per issue.
5,totally satisfied!,We gave it to our grandson for the third year...he loves it so we do too! Ginger and Dodd Wilson
5,Why can't I find this on KINDLE FIRE?,I just got a Kindle Fire with one magazine in mind. Turns out that its not offered on Kindle! WTF?!?!?
4,Deliciously interesting!,"I just found this book last week, and thoroughly enjoyed it.It was L. M. Montgomery at her best. Some of her stories get to betoo sugary, flowery, or with unrealistically nice characters. In this book, however, all of her heroes/heroines are up against some large obstace which they must overcome with grit, determination, and just plain stubbornness. It's hard to be sugary sweet and mulishly stubborn at the same time! Because of this, perhaps, the characters all seemed real to me, and I enjoyed reading about them. Many of the stories were also quite funny, besides, as people often took rather creative approaches to solving their problems. I would definitely recommend this short-story collection."
4,Very well-written.,"The author did a fine job of balancing romance with period information. Unlike many romance novels written about the 9th century Europe, the book lets us glimpse the social and political structures of the time."
4,Viking romance; family fued ; sibling rivalry,This book was good in the fact that the author seemed to have researched this time period. There was some good romance and twists and turns in this book. I really liked the book.
2,Swan Road not very intriguing,This book was slow moving and at times boring. The story was bogged down with too many details and explanations of the period. I had to make myself finish reading it.
2,Electronic tortoise,"The Casio HR-8TEPlus is a lot slower than its grandfather. My grandson wanted a new calculator, so I gave him my old Casio and bought this new one. Big mistake. The action is slower - you can't set an automatic ""A"" decimal for adding money and there is no clear explanation of how to use the alternate keys. I like the older model better."
1,molesta,"señores que ha sucedido que me cobraron y mi producto aun no llega, denme una explicacion por favor o me devuelven mi dinero"
2,who needs a dictionary,"THIS DICTIONARY WAS OKAY. I BOUGHT IT AS A MEDICAL STUDENT THINKING IT WOULD BE USEFUL, IT WAS NOT. I GUESS IT WOULD BE USEFUL FOR PEOPLE OUT OF THE MEDICAL FIELD WHO WANT TO LOOK SOMETHING UP BUT WAS NOT USEFUL FOR ME."
5,Excellent resource,"Anyone that has a necessity, or desire, to know more about what the terms used by their doctor, or teacher, means should pick up this book. I have reached for it numerous times for clarification. It is very easy to understand and the pictures and illustrations are excellent. By far the most user friendly medical terminology reference book I have come across."
2,"Some Good, Some Bad, Mostly awful","The actual tracks with the singers singing on them are dreadful. I have the 1999 Studio Cast starring Jonathon Pryce and I'm positive that is who is singing on these tracks. At any rate, it is one of the most awful group of performances of this score that I have heard.The karaoke tracks are pretty good, but they're incomplete. Where is ""Married""? Where is ""Don't Go""? Where is ""What Would You Do?"" Where is ""So What""? There's just way to much missing to call this the ""Hits of Cabaret"".Also, some of the tracks have way too much rubato tailored to the performers who sing on the other CD. In a real performance of this show, there is NEVER that much rubato, and if there is, it's certainly not done the way they do it here.I have been using this CD to help my high school students rehearse for a production of CABARET, and it's been a great help, but it is so incomplete and incongruent that you're better off creating midi tracks."
5,Indispensible,"The torch of certainty is an essential text for any serious Buddhist practitioner of the Kagyu lineage. The text, written by Jamgon Kongtrul and translated by Judith Hanson, describes the four ordinary foundation practices and the four special foundation practices. These are commonly known as the ngondro practice.The text covers specifics on each practice and should be used alongside the Ngondro text, with instruction from your lama.The introduction includes a section on the Kagyu lineage known as the golden rosary."
3,3.5 Stars,"For the most part, this is an excellent little book, with short descriptions of the four outer and four inner preliminaries, 5-7 pages, and then 10-12 pages of commentary on each. However, it is marred by one minor flaw, and one major flaw.First, the minor one, one I wish I knew before I purchased this book. The descriptions of the inner preliminaries, the practises, are nothing more than brief overviews, and not detailed directions on how to do them. This is cause for the loss of a half-star.The more serious flaw is the printing quality--in places, the text is nearly unreadable. The letters are blurred and imprecise. It is mostly readable, but with great effort. I will definitely be writing to the publisher. The text is plenty large, but a magnifying glass makes it easier. Because of that, I can't recommend this."
3,cute but SMALL,"We ordered this item for our Border Collie as a replacement for her favorite 'baby' that her sister destroyed. After comparing many stuffed monkeys on-line, this one appeared to be the closest to the one that bit the dust. Our dog likes the toy, but it is much smaller than we thought -- I'm not sure how they came up with the measurements listed in the product specifications because I don't see 7 inches from any direction. If you're looking for a very small toy for a dog, then this would be great. -- but it is very small!"
3,Not for big dogs,"Bought this for a 80 pound dog, who loved it, but it really isn't durable enough. Gave them a couple of days of entertainment though."
4,I hate this toy but my dog loves it,"This thing makes the most annoying noises but my dog loves this thing. It bothers me so much that after about 5 minutes of him playing with it, I have to take it from him or I will end up throwing it out and that would break his heart."
4,Dog loves it,My dog Romeo is very enthralled by this toy. He is a German Shepherd/Beagle mix who gets bored very easily and this toy kept his attention for a few hours. I received it lightening fast. The only downside to this is that my dog is a power chewer and has ripped the stuffing out of the head in the first 2 hours. I will buy another one because it holds his attention.
2,Not for big dogs,My Pit Bulls loved this toy! It only lasted about 10 minutes then I heard a crunching sound. It no longer made the chimp sound and the batteries fell out through the damaged hole. This is not big dog tough!
3,almost killed my dog,"After washing some times this stuff, the toy stopped leaving dangerous plastic hair that was making my dog swallowing and vomiting.It's a creative toy but with many improvement opportunities."
5,My Black Lab loves this,My dog loves this chimp. The sounds are very funny and the look on his face when the chimp talks is priceless.
4,Fun but screams!,"This is a cute little chimp and our pug loves it. He'll random pounce and carry it around in his mouth, then curl up with it and take a nap. Our only complaint is the ""monkey"" sound -- it makes one long monkey howl. It starts low, then increases to a high pitched scream which can get annoying fast if your pet finds the sweet spot and likes to set it off repeatedly, just to prove they can. lol It's not extremely loud though so it's bearable. I would probably look for another animal that doesn't scream in nature next time, but I would definitely look for another of this brand."
3,Loved it!!!,"My pack loved it, chewed the face off in the first hour and ate the speaker. I hope the frog fares better."
2,my review,It was ok . Not great. I felt it left out a lot of adds that I remember from the 60s and 70s.
3,annoying,"I purchased this for my son's second birthday, the annoying thing is there is not an on/off button. This toy goes on in the middle of the night waking everyone up it is loud. We tend to stick it out in the garage so it doesn't wake anyone up."
4,flimsy lid,"My 2-year-old son received this toy for his birthday. He liked it. Due its poor design, the lid never stays on. He gets frustrated every time he lifts the lid. He is not gentle with his toys at this age and with any bit of force it pops off and of course he cannot put it back on. The food (especially the burger and buns) are slippery and cannot be flipped by a 2-3 year old child. They never stay on the spatula therefore again making my child frustrated. After the lid falls off and his burger doesn't stay on the spatula, he walks away. He is too young to get what the grill is saying. The grill also makes a sizzling song too long before it shuts off by itself."
3,Not worth the price.,Talking Grill is not worth the expensive price. The lid is very poorly made and constantly falls off. We ended up leaving it off all the time.
3,Very Frustrating,"My son LOVES cooking and loves to watch Daddy cook on the grill. He has fun with this toy but is constantly frustrated by 1) the cover falls off constantly. In fact, every time I pop it back on I jam my finger and my son asks me to do this about 50 times a day. You think HE'S frustrated? and 2)the food, esp the hamburger, is so slippery that he gets mad because it falls off the grill and his spatula - he keeps yelling ""keeps falling off"" and cries! It is so sad. A better design would serve this product well."
2,THE LID WILL NOT STAY ON!,"My kids enjoyed this toy, but soon became very frustrated because the lid constantly falls off. It's now sitting untouched. I feel like I wasted my money."
5,Lots of fun!!!,"This is a really fun toy! My son is 4 and has no problem playing with it. The lid only falls off if you swing it open with force. Normal play does not cause it to fall off. My 10 year old daughter also plays with it with her brother. They have a lot of fun! The only draw back that I have seen is some of the utensils do not say what they are suppose to. For instance the grill might recognize the spatula as the mustard or visa versa. My son doesn't really notice so that's no big deal. Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews, this toy is great fun!"
4,Great toy for my son,"My son loves this toy. He received this toy for his birthday, and he plays with it all the time. The thing that is really annoying about his toy is like the others said the lid does not stay on. Other than that my son loves it and if he is happy I am happy"
1,disgusting toy,"This grill was attractive to my 3 year old granddaughter, but when it said, ""Do we have gas?"" and then made a vulgar noise and exclaimed, ""Yes, we do"" I found it totally unacceptable and decided to purchase another toy."
2,Soooo annoying....,"We received this toy as a gift for our 18 month old son. The moment we took it out of the box, the lid broke off. The sizzling noise the grill makes is so annoying it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. It talks constantly, is loud and incredibly irritating. It is completely overstimulating and does not allow for much creative or imaginative play. We almost immeditately took the batteries out but without the lid attaching properly, it does not interest my son at all. I would not recommend this toy to my worst enemy!!"
2,Disappointing-Not worth the money,"My 3 year old son wanted this very badly, after seeing it on television. It sure looked like fun on the commercial. But after a short period of time, he quickly became bored with it. It is not a toy that gets alot of play in our household, unless another child comes over that has never seen it before. The lid continually falls off. Would not recommend it."
4,Don't buy this one!,"My 3-year-old son has fun with this grill; however, in a house full of toys, this is singlehandedly the most annoying toy he has ever received! It is loud, cannot be turned off, and activates at the slightest movement around it. In addition, the lid constantly falls off. I would only buy this gift if my intention were to strip someone of their sanity."
5,THERE IS A WAY TO SHUT THIS OFF,"I just made a great new discovery that I thought that I would share with all of you. There is a way to shut the grill off. All you have to do is take all the utensils out, take the food off and put the lid down and it shuts off in a couple seconds rather than a couple minutes. You can move it and shake it and it won't start back up. The only way that it will go back on is if you push a button, put the utensils in it, or lift the lid. I was very thankful for this because when we would be just sitting there and my son is running around and causes the floor to vibrate a little then it would turn on and wouldn't go off for quite a while. As far as the slippery food goes we just make a game out of it like who can be the most careful in keeping the food on and if it falls off we just cook it a little longer. I hope this helped all of you a little bit, I know it helped me, especially with my sanity."
3,Non-stop talking machine!,"My son received this as a Christmas gift from his aunt. The thing does not stop talking! My son is 2 and is a huge talker but playing with this toy actually kept HIM quiet with the thing chattered. The lid is constantly falling off (not a bid deal) and the grill needs an on-off button for the talking part. I LOVE the lights on the gril, looks like thereal deal. The mechanical sound of the face moving is VERY fustrating for me. In desperation my husband clipped the wires that make it talk and installed a on-off button. My two year old LOVES it now, so does his parents! He is talking back to the grill and has much more fun now that it is semi silent.Playskool should have done a few more tests with actual parents before marketing (our main complaint is the on-off switch) but overall once it is quiet its a great toy!"
4,looks better on a television commercial!,"We cook out alot as a family, so we thought that my little boy, who is 2 1/2, would love this toy. Sure enough, when he saw the ads on TV he really wanted to have it. We bought the grill, brought it home and had fun with it at first. One of the downfalls is that the plastic food and utensils are so slippery that the food falls off of the spatula and makes it impossible to ""flip"" the burgers (even for parents who want to demonstrate). Even after being quite persistent and dropping the burger several times, my son got frustrated and disappointed with this.Also, when lifting the lid, it must be put back very gently (2 years olds rarely know ""gently"")or it falls off the hinges. It falls off much easier than it is to put back on!Cute idea though, and my son loves to take his grill outside and ""cook"" with daddy!"
2,Fun For Awhile,This grill is the only thing my son could talk abouth for two weeks after seeing the commercial for it. I finally purchased it for him when I had a ... coupon - (since it is a little pricey.) He had fun with it for about 2-3 days and then after the lid kept falling off he became frustrated and bored with it. If the lid could be redesigned and would keep from falling off he maybe would have played with it longer. I also thought like others that the food was a little slippery and hard to maneuver on the grill.
4,JOHN3,I BOUGHT IT FOR MY SON'S 3RD B-DAY. OVERALL THE TOY IS FUN. THE TOP KEEPS COMING OFF. IT NEEDS AN OFF BUTTON INSTEAD OF HAVING TO WAIT UNTIL NO ONE IS MESSING WITH IT. HE SEEMS TO ENJOY IT DESPITE OF THE FEW FLAWS I'VE NOTICED.
4,I don't know why it's got a bad rep...,"This toy is great. My son loves it!! As for the farting noises, those other fanatical parents need to get over it. (like they're not going to hear something grosser in pre-k). I found to turn it off, I face it the opposite way, towards a wall or something (remember furby?)..as for the lid, my son just plays with the grill with or without the lid. I definatly reccomend this to anyone who has a 3 or 4 year old. It sparks imagination, and is certainly worth the money. Everyone keeps complaining that is flimsy, but what toy isn't?? You can't tell me that you have all your other toys, intact in a playroom. C'mon moms!! What's with you?"
2,No off button,"The toy is cute and my daughter will play with it for awhile before getting bored, but it has no off button and is very sensative to movement. You can shut the bedroom door and the thing will start talking. Just kinda annoying."
1,PLAYSKOOL NONSTOP TALKING GRILL,"I Bought this toy for my 3year old daughter. First of all on Christmas day she said for my husband and I not to go near the grill because it ""won't stop talking""! She has not touched it since. Secondly, any movement or touch and the grill starts talking. My sister and I tried one of the suggestions of holding the button down for 3 seconds. He continued to talk. Lastly, the lid is constantly falling off. I would definately say this is an outside toy for the summer. I am a very open-minded parent but this toy is getting on everyone's nerves. If a child is tired of this toy, then I think more research should have gone into this toy to make sure the fantasy lasts more than 2 minutes. Be careful Parents, think 3 times before buying!"
2,Bad Review from my 6 year old,I bought this toy for my 6 year old son. I thought he would like it becaue it was similar to a grill dad uses. He immediately dislike it by saying it talks too much. He did not like the fact that the top kept falling off. So I return it to the store for a different toy that did not talk as much.
2,normac8141,"My 2 boys age 16 months and 3 1/2 really like this toy. I don't like it because I have to keep putting the stinking lid back on! It falls off constantly! Also it needs an OFF button, Santa had a hard time keeping it quiet when he left it and the kids were sleeping."
3,Too chatty!,"This was the one and only toy my 3-year-old son asked for this year. My main complaint is the darn thing talks too much. If your child wants to play with it and make up his own dialogue (i.e., creative and imaginitive play) he can't! It desperately needs an off switch, and even when on, it should leave more opportunity for a child's own interaction. Also, like others, we have trouble with the lid falling off. Could have been an awesome toy, but disappointing to him and to me."
2,LOST INTEREST QUICKLY!,My son received this as a Birthday Present after asking for it all year long!!! This toy kept his active mind busy for about half an hour and that's been it! My daughter likes to play with it every now and then (mostly as a step stool for climbing over the back of the couch though:0). The lid is forever falling off and the utensils end up being played with separately.The phrases the grill says are limited and the actions are limited - thus my kids aren't interested anymore - it's the same thing all the time. It needs to interact more - it's a cute idea but just doesn't do enough to keep them stimulated.
1,Please read the manual,"Whoever wrote that it didnt have an on/off switch: there's a reason that a manual comes in just about anything you buy. this is an incredibly annoying toy that my 2 year old daughter lost interest in very quickly... and to turn it off you have to wait til he stops talking and hold the button for 3 seconds with the lid shut, and not touch another button. it doesnt do anything but sizzle and repeat the same phrases, and the foods couldnt be made any cheaply. i do not recommend this toy to anyone."
3,Lid falls off,"We bought this toy for our 3 year-old son last year for Christmas. The toy has no off/on switch so the thing is going off at all hours of the day and night. Also the lid falls off so easily, all you need to do is open the lid too fast and off it goes(this is really annoying!!!!) The toy is cute but my son gets mad everytime the lid falls off so he doesn't play with it anymore, needless to say now my 1 year-old daughter plays with it."
5,Why is this not available?,"I am rating this on the fact of my son wanting it so badly!!My 5yr. old Absolutely wants this!!I called the store and they only carry it at Christmas Time!!Can anyone tell me why a ""summer time"" toy would only beavailable @ Christmas time."
2,too small for the money,"We bought this for our 4 yr. old for Christmas. For the price, I was very disappointed. It's VERY small. The lid falls off. The kids do enjoy the talking part of it, but because it's such a very small toy, only the 8month old plays with it now. Unless it's on a huge sale-don't spend this much money."
3,"Not much lake detail, No instructions on interpretation","The product DOES provide better detail on roads, which my husband liked. Some roads not visible before can now be seen. BUT it did not come with any type of instructions on how to interpret the lines on the lakes. AND MANY of the arkansas lakes dont even receive ANY attention; they remain white like they were before implanting the chip. If I could do it over again, I probably would have bought something different, as the intent was to provide better mapping of the lakes. I suppose it shows or reveals a couple of islands, but its just not what we thought it was going to be."
2,Terrible map,"Bought this mainly for Texas lake maps. Detail for Lake Conroe is awful. Wanted stumps info but there's not much there; boat ramps and marinas are in the wrong place; depth on north side of lake isn't there.One of the most irritating issues aside from incorrect lake info is they intentionally make the roads show up wrong. The road detail is actually pretty good, but the GPS does not put your location on the right road in this mapping software; called customer service and they said we'd have to buy their road maps for correct road information. Had no choice so we did and surprise, surprise, the road map software has no problem placing you in the correct spot. Now we have to switch between road maps and lake maps, depending on the information we want to see, and we're out double our money.Very disappointed with Garmin for taking advantage of the consumer."
4,how does this relate to anne?,"I HAVE TO SAY THESE CELTIC SONGS ARE GREAT BUT TO BE MORE EXACT, I DON'T SEE HOW ANY OF THESE SONGS HELP DEFINE AND RELATE TO OUR ""ANNE OF GREEN GABLES"". ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN MY OPINION. THE CELTIC SONGS ARE GREAT BUT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ANNE SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ONE THAT IS, GET THE ORIGINAL, ORIGINAL FROM HAGOOD HARDY!"
3,Rough and ready,"Well this live Man disc is a little rough but worth the purchase price anyway.A lot of people compare Man to a variety of West Coast bands but in reality I feel that they where a unique musical experience. Opinion often seems to be split between rabid fans and almost as rabid detractors, but all the best bands seem to have that problem.Like many UK bands from this period Man lack a great vocalist( but then that never bothered the Grateful Dead either) which sometimes let them down , however if guitar solos and good tunes are your thing then you will find plenty to like here.Although not as good as the live side of the double album Back to the Future and various bootlegs from the same period this is a wonderful artifact from a time when music was looser and all the better for it."
4,A compact synopsis of the profession and atypical situations,"A well written book for new students or techs who've been out of the trauma loop for a while. Gives complete information on situations that were not taught or encountered in training. Such as a detailed when and why section of patient assessment and a trade drug chart and how it will affect patient cooperation. It also tells you of which type of accident will produce which kind of injury and gives case studies, self-assessment test and answers. The book also covers technical considerations, conversion charts and has positioning and pathology diagrams. But the kicker is it gives you basic patient commands in 5 different languages!! There is much more included that I've probably left out. The only thing that could make this book better is if it had actual photos - but the drawn diagrams are great."
1,student,When i was going through college we were required to buy this book for one of our classes. I felt this book was a waste of my money and i don't recommend this book to anyone. I did not find this book helpful or interesting in the least bit.
4,Great condition,"There was a little high-lighting in the book, but it was in great condition. I would deffinately do bussiness with this seller again."
2,Jumped the shark....,"This book was well written, exciting and flowed well....UNTIL it jumped the shark at the end not once but TWICE!!! I guess the author and editor decided that every book needs an unseen and amazing twist or two or three to be interesting. Instead of keeping it a hard core investigative book finding out the killer and possible rapist. The likable main character stumbles several times and misses (obvious clues & issues)!! The twist at the end (which I guessed and begged him not to do) he did, and the entire last 80 pages of the book destroyed the first half of the book which I was planing on giving a 5 star rating!!! Definitely not worth reading. I may try one of his other books in the hopes that he doesn't try again to go overboard with a wowza unbelievable ending!!!"
1,Don't be fooled by flood of NY reviews,"Sift through the positive reviews and you'll notice 3 things: 1.) The author goes to college in NY. All those good reviews are from his friends in Westchester and Queens.2.) The 5 star editorial review is from the small college publication that Keslowitz writes for, not an unbiased, 3rd party publication.3.) Everyone that doesn't know Keslowitz personally hates the book. Just look through the reviews further to see what I meanThe fact that this book was published makes me sick to my stomach. What makes me even sicker is that people are actually wasting their money on it."
1,If the book is as self-aggrandizing as the author...,"Okay, almost every review is written in a similar style and by ""A Reader from (wherever)."" The supposed newspaper quote is from the same paper that the author writes for, so that's also meaningless. In other words, nobody who's actually read the book has reviewed it yet, so the unusually high rating is fictitious.Perhaps the one negative review was too harsh and written by someone who doesn't like the author. But the 10 glowing reviews are not to be believed either; they were all apparently written by the author or his friends.Based on the author's stuffing of the ballot box, I'm rating this book with 1 star to try and balance the scales somewhat. Perhaps once some objective parties actually read the book and post their reviews we'll see an honest rating.Neat cover though. :-)""Me fail English? That's unpossible!"" - Ralph Wiggum"
1,Laughable--but not in a good way.,"This book is dreadful. The analysis is amateurish at best; they are the sort of conclusions you could draw instantly by just watching the show, yet the author has decided to make a buck writing them down. One chapter is, in reality, no more than a listing of all the characters the author could remember. Sadly, this may be the most informative chapter. It is poorly written, both gramatically and stylistically, and even as a collection of quotes it fails miserably (some are just plain wrong). Perhaps most disturbing is the positive critical review at the top of this page from the Excelsior--his college newspaper. To wonder whether the author himself wrote that review does not require a far stretch of the imagination. This is a disgusting display of greed."
4,"If you like The Simpsons, read this book","The Simpsons in academic form! Funny quotes, insightful analysis, and an intriguing writing style. The book is less challenging than some of the more difficult Simpsons books. The reading is accessible, and the chapters are fun to read. Keslowitz addresses many issues in 160 pages, and leaves the reader with a new sense of knowledge about The Simpsons. If you're a Simpsons fan, grab a bag of popcorn, a TV, and check out this book. (Especially enjoyed the Homer chapter - yeah, Homer's not a great father, but he does try hard!)"
1,Can I give it 0 stars?,"As a die-hard fan I felt a duty to finish the book; the best thing I can say about it is that it was short, and printed in huge font. Nice cover though. Don't be fooled by the other reviews."
5,GREAT READ.. FULL OF INSIGHT AND HUMOR,"A scholarly approach to the popular television series. If you're even a casual fan of The Simpsons, you'll enjoy this book. And if you're a huge Simpsons fan (like me), you'll find it great because the quotes and episode references are extremely detailed.Rating: 5 Stars"
1,Worst Simpsons book ever,"The book starts off as a poor effort to explain how various Simpsons characters fit in as, or have affected typical members of American society. With incorrect plot and quote references aplenty, the book quickly disintegrates into a hodge podge of poorly written chapters that wouldn't have made the grade in a freshman high school english class. Farther into the book the author loses sight of what the book is supposed to be about and switches to explaining other authors views of American politics, work attitudes and home life with miserably thin attempts to relate the views to the Simpsons. With minimal time the mistakes were easily researchable and correctable. I don't think much could have been done with the writing style. I had a very hard time stomaching and finishing this book. So far this is the worst book on the subject of the Simpsons. It does not even earn one star but that is the lowest rating available. Don't waste time or money on this book. I'm sorry I did!"
1,Don't buy this book,"This book is terrible, and by far the worst Simpsons related piece of writing on the market. The content is worthless: pedestrian insight based on mangled Simpsons quotes. The writing style is equally irritating. Normally I'm not one to complain (caveat emptor and all that), but I cannot abide the obvious planting of fake ratings by the author at this site and at other online bookstores. Potential buyers rely on the veracity of those ratings when making their purchasing decisions. By planting fake comments the author is essentially using fraud to increase the sales of his work. Shameful."
1,"Keslowitz, you lucky dog, you.","How this author ever managed to get a publishing deal is FAR beyond me. This book is absolutely packed with misinformation, poor analysis, grammatical mistakes and ignorant, surfacy statements. If you are going to write a book on such a profound and enigmatic television show, please be one of the viewers who actually GETS it. I think any of the previous or current writers of the Simpsons would either laugh, laugh til' they cried, or just cried if they were forced to sit down and read this book.If there is one thing I learned from this book it is that The Simpsons is funny while this author is not. Perhaps the first few pages can be entertaining when you stop and think somebody out there in this world was stupid enough to waste their time coming to simple-minded conclusions about a show with ground-breaking depth. Praise God if you do laugh and manage to allow that momentum to carry you through the rest of the book.A complete catastrophe. Avoid at all costs."
1,"It takes two to lie, and unfortunately I listened","Make sure you read all the reviews about this: horrible writing and insight that 8th graders laugh at is a winning combination. The guy at Tufts 'teaching' the book? Not a real class -- the instructor is also an undergrad, like the author. The only reason I own this book is because I was suckered into buying it by the earlier ""reviews"". Simpsons fans, please learn from my error. Stay away!This book and his attendant efforts to sell it are hopefully the worst thing the author will ever do. ""Fraud"" is a big word -- Mr. Keslowitz would be wise to have someone explain it to him before he sees it in a complaint. Or an arrest warrant."
1,I would like a refund,"Steve (since you are obviously reading and posting here): I bought your utterly worthless pos after reading the ""reviews"", which I've since come to realize were written by you or your friends. Bravo.I love a good scam, and you have one, no doubt. You saw that Simpsons fans are rabid for anything related to OFF and will buy anything, and you took advantage. Again, bravo sir. I salute you."
5,WOW!,"Arlington is a musical genius and has put his heart, his hands, and his ears to Gods work! His music is an inspiration! This CD is a wonderful CD full of music that will make your heart skip a beat! It is a MUST for any music lover!"
3,Not bad. Needs some polishing.,"I bought this textbook to study for the California section of the PG exam. It definitely helped. I enjoyed the final section that presented concepts from previous chapters in a grand-scheme California geologic history. It's not state-of-the-art research, but it's good enough to help wrap your head around the big picture without getting bogged down in too many details.Several figures were pulled from other sources and didn't list acronyms or explain how they related to the subject. They looked good but didn't help understand the topic. I also felt like information about some topics was scattered throughout the book; so I really needed to read the whole thing to pull it all together in my mind.I would recommend to anyone with an introductory geology education or a professional who needs to brush up on their regional geology."
5,Worth it,"This book gets me through the California Supplemental Examination for my PG. It is easy to read and understand (if you are a geologist), without making the book less the substance.I like how Harden pictures one geologic event. The examples of places names are a familiar one, thus (if you live long enough in California) you can relate to them.It is definitely one to keep."
5,An Excellent reference book,"My wife first read this book several years ago after checking it out from our local public library. She's delighted with it. It is a foundation piece for anyone interested in geology in general, and of California in particular."
4,Another Great Joaquin Sabina Album,"A friend of mine from Spain sent me this item since I have been a longtime Sabina fan. Along with the CD was a booklet which has the lyrics for the songs as well as a DVD on which Sabina and other musicians talk about their music. For someone who is not completely fluent in Spanish like I am, the fact we have the lyrics written down is very nice, although I'm now looking for good translations for some of the lyrics. Que siga cantando, Sabina! Keep on singing, Sabina!"
5,íntimo y poético,"como siempre poesia, pero esta vez mas intimo, como buen alivio, todavia saliendo del hueco sin pretender correr de nuevo...Como canciones propias de Joaquin (letras a las que nos acostumbra), me gustan mas ""Pie de guerra"" y ""Me pido primer"""
4,Uno de los mejore cd's que he escuchado,Realment Joaqu?n es un gran poeta y cantautor. este es uno de los mejores cd's que he escuchado en largo tiempo.
5,Absolutely beautiful.,"The richness of America is highlighted through the stories of gratitude and suffering experienced by our newest citizens. You will be a better person after watching this doc, guaranteed."
2,Let's Talk the Truth,"I too was taught by Dr. Meisenberg, which he teaches at a Caribbean Medical School, Ross. First of all, he has a very strong accent to understand in the class. Second, I did not find the book to be written well. Third, the other professors who also taught my biochem class stated that there was some errors and information missing. Personally, I would suggest Basic Approach to BioChem,(which was suggested by one of the other biochem teachers to me) if you are like me and struggled in undergrad with chem & organic chemistry. It spells out everything also another good Biochem that helped me get through this course was Lippincott's Biochemistry...a good book too."
1,Numerous Basic Errors,"The error start in the second and third formulae in Chapter 1 (page 4). Both confuse the number (mol) and concentration (molarity), which any person who has had general chemistry should discover. In addition, it incorrectly states that it is 1 in 5 million molecules of water dissociate; it is correctly 1 in 555 million, which any person capable of basic math should discover. Numerous basic errors repeat to the end of the text. The number of basic errors in the text should cause doubt of its validity. Use Berg or Lehninger or Devlin."
2,Not so great,"This book was required for my biochem. course and I would not recommend it for someone who it learning the information for the first time or who has not had a biochemistry course. It is highly condensed and would probably be great if studying for the USMLE, COMLEX etc b/c it is more of a review. A lot of details that are needed to understand the basic concepts are left out."
4,Great Textbook,"The author, Dr. Meisenberg, actually teaches Biochemistry at the medical school I attend. I found the text very well formatted and the illustrations extremely helpful. I personally read this book from cover to cover and along with the BRS, I think Biochemistry doesn't have to be a painful experience. Meisenberg integrates metabolism and other important subjects into several chapters to re-emphasize key points over and over. Many elaborate illustrations and graphs make learning hard to remember facts easier, and with the help of pertinent biochemical clinical facts you'll soon find relevance in a clinical setting far away from the classroom."
5,Great Book,I have had the honor of having the author as a teacher in Medical School. He is a very smart man in all aspects of Medical Biochemistry. More straight-forward and clinical than most other texts.
2,bad,"the visual illastrations are almost non existant and the book was extreamly disorganized, for example, he will discuss a topic in one chapter, then talk about something else, then go back to it in another chapter. I would go with Voet, lipincott and BRs biochem"
4,Julia age 8,"the only thing that I DONT like is the arms are flimsy, and wish she could move on her own."
3,Ok,"I like this doll ,but there is a thing I dint like about it too. Whrn she falls asleep she only has her eyes closed for a minute. It is not very life like because if she is sleeping she should adleast have her eyes closed for the whole time!"
3,Gotta go back to the store.,"I bought the *NEW* version of baby annabell last Tuesday. It was for my 6 year old daughter. Well, the doll started off great, but, after 30 min. of play and a little bit of water from her bottle, she started making malfunctioning noises! UGH! My daughter was upset. I thought it might be the batteries, so I replaced them. But, it happend shortly afterwards. It's a high pitched noise. Also, we had trouble making her burp and cry the ""real tears"". My daughter was disappointed that this doll was so much ""work"" for the age group it is designed for. So, she is going back to the store. I don't know if my daughter will choose to replace her or just get a different doll."
3,Eveyln Woods reading technique a must for this boring book!,"Where to begin. Too much detail for too little story. 500 pages to lightly touch on the problems that mother-daughter, sister-sister might have had. If this is a prize winning author, then let me stick to the Coben's, the Connelly's, Lisa See, Picoult, etc. I think that Joyce even fell asleep during the writing, and that is why she confused the names Ron/Rob, etc.. Also, a trite thing but every time I read the name of the palce they were from, I read it as Mr. instead of Mt. because of the font used. Don't waste your money, but for sure not your time."
2,This book moves too slowly!,"The book started out great, but has been dragging on and on. It would have been a better short story.I do not recommend this one."
3,lacks emotional impact,"This novel is nicely structured, nicely written and all that, but lacks the emotional impact that many of Oates' books have. Perhaps it is because the daughter was not close to her mother as an adult; while believable, the depth of her feelings are a surprise. I appreciated that the loss causes the daughter to accept and even imitate her mother's best qualities, rather than rebel against them; in contrast, the daughter who was nominally closer to the mother as an adult, gets little from her mother's life or death.My favorite chapter was the one in which the daughter visits her Aunt Tabitha: it was interesting, powerful, compressed. On the other hand, the daughter's relationship with Strabane seemed a bit contrived.For a moving book on loss, I recommend Joan Didion's ""The Year of Magical Thinking"" (non-fiction by a noted novelist and journalist)."
5,Believable characters,I found myself strongly drawn to this story and could not put it aside until I finished it. The mother-daughter-sister relationships portrayed were so real as was the revealed inner life of the main character. I have always enjoyed this authors writing but I also found this oddly compelling for reasons I still cannot identify.
4,"Real good, to a point...","It's good. But I didn't much care for Knowing and learning how to make pots. But, I have to admit that the rests of the story was really good."
5,A Must See,We feel all parents and pastors should see this video. We have told everyone we know to get it and watch it and share it with as many people as you can.
5,A must see for each and every American Christian,Very insightful....well researched and factual evidence of what is currently happening in the church today. I recommend this to every Christian parent
2,Divided Divides,"I wrote a blog addressing the kind of legalism that is found in teachings like the one given in the film 'Divided'. To have or not to have Sunday School is a Grey area that God will be faithful to lead parents in INDIVIDUALLY. I have such a heart for mothers, and their families, to be freed from the bondage of rules that God has not given in His Word. I wrote a blog addressing this and the first post (found by scrolling down to the bottom) is a lengthy review of 'Divided' that my husband and I wrote together. It was written out of love, with a heart for unity and a passion for the truth! You can link to it here:[...]Brothers and sisters in Christ, please remember that ""it is for freedom that Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery"" (Galatians 5:1)."
1,"""Crackpot Spammer"" exactly!","This author said ""bye bye"" to reality some time ago. He spammed me by e-mail to buy his book. My succinct rejection of the invitation was answered with a quasi-apocalyptic warning:""SOONER OR LATER YOU WILL FIND OUT HOW WRONG YOU ARE. SMARTEN UP!""Uh ... right!This book is clearly one of the poorer examples of the now extremely outdated anti-big-bang movement, a fave source of quote mining for young-earth creationists. Some people never give up. Google your way to UCLA Cosmologist Ned Wright's site on ""Errors in some popular attacks on the Big Bang"" for clear explanations of how egregiously wrong are many of the notions in ""Bye Bye Big Bang.""If you want to say ""hello"" to real science, say Bye Bye to William Mitchell."
1,Not worth the paper it's written on,"It's not often you can dismiss a book outright just by reading the back cover, but this is one. If the universe isn't expanding why are almost all galaxies receding from us? Galaxies don't expel nearly enough matter to sustain his continuous formation scenario.This looks like another attempt by creationists to blindly ignore the facts in an attempt to keep their ridiculous interpretation of the bible alive. There are many huge gaps in our knowledge of how the universe was created, this is not the book to learn about them"
1,This author needs to get a life.,"Everyone has their right to believe what they want. But.. I don't think this author should dwell on whats he thinks is wrong. Just believe in what you believe is right. If you are going to make a book about how the Big Bang is wrong, why not make a book about how Christianity is wrong or how Atheism is wrong. People are going to believe what they want. But its not right to sit there and say whats wrong and right. Its about what you believe. Let people believe in the Big Bang. You should just believe its wrong and just worry about worse things in life. You may think the Big Bang is wrong, but at the same time, you dont know what really happened. No one knows what really happened. Some people just think the Big Bang seems alittle more realistic than a God making the universe. Try not focusing on whats ""wrong"" and start just worrying about what you believe and what you think is right. Its so dumb to put down others beliefes or theories."
3,Not as helpful as Arp,I did not find this book as helpful as Arp's books or thunderbolts.info for interpreting the full range of geophysical and astronomical observations available today.
1,I agree - crackpot spammer,"I'm a professional cosmologist, and I was also spammed by this guy. I took some of the time to look at this author's ideas, and I have to say that he is completely confused and doesn't understand physics. His ideas are complete pseudoscience."
4,Love it,"Living in a city apartment, theres no outdoor grilling space so il really glad I got this. Its a little hard to clean every nook amd cranny but Everything that comes off this grill is delicious so I dont mind. It cooks evenly throughout the grill, no cold spots and it comes apart easily for storage."
3,Electrical plug and controls seemed to get too warm,"This grill is exactly what I was looking for, a fully open grill plate, right size and shape, seemed to be made well, but the electrical plug and controls seemed to get too warm to be comfortable with and had to send back. When I called to return, Amazon.com Customer Service was friendly and promptly issued an RMA and refunded money right away. Amazon.com rocks!"
4,Delonghi grill,"Love this product. We use it nearly every day, and it works very well. It could be a little easier to clean though."
3,Nothing like a real BBQ gas grill,"I bought this grill to replace my gas BBQ grill that I had for years on my terrace. I live in a co-op and was told it was a fire hazard. After using it for the first and only time I realized cooking with an electric grill is no substitute for cooking on a real BBQ grill. Found out that I can't return it because its been used. Looks like I'm stuck with it. Doubt if I'II use it again. As for the grill itself, cooking on it took longer then I expected and I thought clean up would be a little easier."
5,Very pleased,"I bought this for my mother and she loves it. Unlike most reviews, hers works fine and she has no complaints."
2,Grill?,This Indoor grill is everything but Perfecto. Not enough heating power even in max. Do not expect a grill taste on your food. Wish I had returned it.
5,Great,"I really love this product and use it on a regular basis. I cook meats, veggies, and fruits on it. I only wish the temp were a little higher; however, I still love it."
3,Limited Use,"Unfortunately the use of this product is limited. I would not have purchased if I had known that you are unable to cook chicken legs, thighs, wings or any other part other than boneless chicken breast fillets. It certainly does not perform the cooking functions of a true grill in my opinion"
1,Sorry Delonghi.....Not A Good Product!!,"I did my homework and I thought I was buying a great table top indoor grill to cook chicken and steaks to replace a different brand that had just died on me. Well, I was very disappointed when I used it the first time and ""tried"" to grill pork chops. It took forever (much longer than the manual stated) and I had the temp setting at the highest. They finally did get done but were not very tasty and dried out because I had to cook them so long. My opinion is that because the grill is open on the bottom to the drip pan and the eating element is underneath....much of the heat goes down and not up to the food on top.It was, however, easy to clean which was good because I packed it up and shipped it back the next day.Sorry Delonghi, back to the drawing board."
4,"Great Indoor Grill, Better then the Foreman for Natural Grill Feel","This grill is pretty darn good for an indoor, non-foreman like Grill. I grill, alot, and wanted something for the winters. At the time, I was in a townhouse, so there was no garage grilling going on. (With the door open of course)Make sure you fill the drip tray with water, it helps keep it clean from he drippings.Steaks can be cooked to order, Rare, med, and well done, come out great. Chicken is good, but boned chicken, like quarters, can take some time.4 out of 5 stars because the grill marks are not as good as they could be. Could get a little hotter in my opinion for this.Coating on the grill has lasted, as long as you just wipe with a rag."
2,DOES NOT HEAT UP,"I gave it two stars for its big grilling space, but if a grill doesn't serve its purpose, it is no good. I waited 10-15 minutes for the light to go out before I started cooking. I wanted to grill shrimps and hoped that it would take only few minutes for me get the dinner ready. The grill didn't heat up enough for the shrimp to cook. Instead, they became chewy because they were cooked on slow heat (5 max heat on the grill). I was extremely frustrated with the results. I read a lot of reviews before making this purchase. Many customers mentioned that this grill doesn't heat up and suggested that they must have gotten a defective piece. I don't think that many people received defective product. This grill just doesn't heat up. My husband said there is no need for the lid because grill doesn't heat up enough for anything to splatter. If anyone honestly knows a better product for indoor grilling, please recommend it to me."
4,Great grill!!,"The grill is great, heats up fairly quickly and the nonstick surface is amazing for grilling! Indicator light shows when grill has preheated, and changing temperature while cooking is fast and easy. Cleaning the grill is not difficult, but slightly time consuming, as you need to get between all of the holes in the grill surface.Pros: Easy to use, great grill lines, delicious foodCons: Cleaning"
4,Too cold outside,Easy to use and easy to clean. Not much smoke. I also like the glass lid. Nice to see it cook.
4,complaint,well when my husband opened it and put it all together there was no handle for the glass lid so
5,Love my Delonghi Perfecto indoor grill!!,"I love this grill! I am an outdoor grill enthusiast, and this grill comes very close. I found it to sear, and also cook to my satisfaction, food on the first try. Of course, food cooked on my indoor grill doesn't get caramelized or smoked like over coals or an open flame, but the taste factor ranks just as high. I have yet to be disappointed, and if great care is given, I don't think I will be!!"
3,Not hot enough,I have only used this product once to cook Turkey Sausage. Even on the highest temperature the grill did not seem to get hot enough and when I turned it down per the instructions it took forever to cook. Im not pleased with this product but will try it again keeping the Temp on high.
1,stick with the George Foreman instead,"My George Foreman grill stopped working in December--after a couple of days I ran to Macy's to replace it but they had none in stock. In desperation I bought the DeLonghi grill. I've lived with it for about 6 weeks and my conclusion is: IT SUCKS!!!! The George Foreman grill is not perfect but if you are happy with it do not switch to this grill. Yes, the DeLonghi is easier to clean but I'm more interested in cooking than cleaning and the DeLonghi is lame in the cooking department. The glass cover of the DeLonghi is BS--we don't want to steam the food--we want to grill it."
1,Poor quality,"Got this grill, last only one year. the connector has a flaw design; some small pieces will snap and break, no repair, no warranty. great idea but poor manufacturing."
1,Not worth purchasing,"In my opinion this grill does not get hot enough to do any justice to a steak or hamburger. After preheating the suggested length of time, a 3/4"" Delmonico steak took 10 minutes per side to cook to a medium rare stage, leaving only faint grill marks. Hamburgers turned out the same. I called Delonghi customer service and they were not at all helpful. I will not use it again to cook beef. Maybe chicken would fare better."
5,Excellent Grill,I bought this grill after reading all the reviews here and elsewhere. This grill works great. I heat it for about 5-10 minutes and it cooks very fast with excellent grill marks. If others have had problems with it getting hot then either they did not let it heat long enough or they got a bad unit and they just need to get a replacement. I have cooked pork steaks and Rib Eye steaks and they come off the grill just like my outdoor grill. I have used other indoor grills and this is by far the best.
4,Pretty good product,"Was looking for an indoor grill and glad to have found this one. It works really well. Cooks evenly, no smoke, looks good on counter, much better quality than those competitive products you hear about from famous chefs. Just a bit hard to clean inbetween the grooves, but that's to be expected of any grill like this. Good quality product-I'm happy."
5,GREAT GRILL!!!,I love this grill - it is extremely easy to clean. Truly a non-stick grill unlike my Calphalon grill pan that is very difficult to clean. Works great with chicken and fish and the lid is a wonderful extra feature.
5,Greatest indoor grill ever!,"I bought a substitute , but it didn't cut it! I had to get my Delonghi grill!! :)"
2,Grill disappointmnet,"Looked good online, and the meat is juicy. BUT it's very hard to clean (can't immerse grill tray), it's very heavy and clunky, and no recipe book came with it. The tiny instruction book is pretty useless, and I found the food took 5 times as long to cook as they said."
1,Hated it,I was so excited to try this grill after doing all the research and reading the mostly positive reviews. After cooking on the grill I hated it. It cooks very slowly and doesn't heat up evenly. It took 40 minutes to cook bratwurst and I still had to nuke them in the microwave to heat the center. I'll go back to my George Foreman grill.
1,Amazon unable to package grill properly,"The first grill purchased was improperly packaged and broken when received.The replacement grill was also improperly packaged and broken when received.The return procedure was frustrating, receiving the same email over and over with no provision for return. Finally found a phone number to customer service who processed return labels.Then Amazon issued an incorrect credit to my credit card. Requiring more time and phone calls.The grill may be great, but I will never know--the hassle was not worth pursuing a third time."
4,Great Indoor Grill,"We live in a condo that doesn't allow outdoor grills of any kind so when I found this indoor grill on amazon.com I figured I would give it a try. I've had it about a month and use it very often. I've grilled steaks, shrimp, burgers, vegetables and more and it comes out delicious. I find it heats up quickly and the food cooks fast. I line the bottom drip pan with foil for easy cleanup. The grill grate does need some elbow grease to get it cleaned but I usually rinse it off as soon as it cools and let it sit for a bit to soften up then I use one of those little kitchen brushes and it comes clean. It does take a lot of space for storage so keep that in mind when purchasing as it was recommened to store flat."
3,Good alternative for grilling indoors,"I read a lot of reviews on this before buying and I definitely think this is a good quality grill. I'm not sure I agree with most people that it ""sears meats perfectly"" but it definitely leaves some nice grill marks and tastes better than the George Foreman grill (the fat doesn't stay around the food as much). Mind you, I did let it preheat for 10 minutes on high before grilling. It is a bit of a pain to clean, but a nice non-stick safe sponge/scrubber should get you on your way. My wife said she was definitely impressed with the flavor of the food (and she's my number one skeptic!) I'm a big outdoor griller in the spring/summer/fall so charcoal or propane outdoor grills are the way to go during grilling season but while it's cold out, I'll just stick to the Delonghi. I am eager to try out some vegetables and kebabs on the grill.Oh and as a side note, I left the lid off when I grilled chicken - I didn't want to steam the food like other reviewers have said."
3,"Cooks well, but isn't really nonstick","This grill cooks great at high or low temperatures. One downside is that the nonstick cooking surface isn't as nonstick as I would like. I've used other nonstick products that work better in that regard. It would also be nice if the grilling surface could fit in the dishwasher.Although I am not dissatisfied with this purchase, I would probably choose a grill that can be cleaned in the dishwasher if I could do it all over again."
5,delonghi grill,"I ordered this grill for a gift and one for myself. We absolutely love it. We've made chicken breasts, pork chops and riblets on it and they all were fantastic. If I had used our gas grill outside, the chicken would have been overcooked as well as the pork chops.It does take awhile to heat up but if you do that it cooks to perfection. So I would recommend this item to anyone."
4,Love this grill,"This is a great product. I did research and more costly options fell short. Some come with no glass cover? Some don't get hot enough? Some don't have the grease tray below to keep from smoking. After brief skepticism, i find this thing can do it all. No flat surface, this little grill gets hot enough to leave grill marks on salmon, and chicken or anything. You can place the cover on to keep burgers moist.Its worked out so well, I have just purchased my second grill to have more surface area. Now I can grill up the veggies while the steaks sizzle for fajitas! Clean up is pretty easy though i would recommend a decent grill brush to get in the grooves. I have read you can toss it in the dishwasher as well. I purchased my first one a while ago when it was almost $80 and it was well worth it. Now that it was reduced, its a no-brainer."
5,FANTASTIC Grill!!!,"Purchased this grill just after Xmas 2011. Used it for the first time last night and could not be more thrilled!! Marinated some chicken breasts in pineapple teriyaki overnight and just threw them on. They were absolutely delicious and everyone raved about them! Beautiful grill marks and carmelization of the marinade.Manual says to pre-heat on high for 10 mins but my experience is that the pre-heat light goes off after about 6. Food does not stick at all (pre-oiled with (olive) oil as suggested in the manual) and cleanup was a breeze, even with a sticky marinade. Cleaned the grill and then cooked zucchini slices marinaded in balsamic and olive oil. Also delicious, and no transfer of teriyaki flavor from the chicken.My oven, stove and bbq are going to be getting far less use. Seriously, one of the best appliances I have purchased ever. STRONGLY recommend."
2,Nice grill but only lasted one year.,We bought this grill about a year ago. It worked fine. Hard to clean. Heavy. After a year the screws fell out of the handle and the cord shorted out so we have purchased a new grill. For $100 it should have lasted over a year.
4,Great! But...,"I absolutely love cooking on this grill. I live in an apartment and do not have the space for a full-size grill, so this is a great compromise. However, it is a pain (and I mean a PAIN) to clean. They should include a brush for cleaning between the grill, because getting in between is very difficult. Aside from that, I use it all the time and it grills very well."
5,Delonghi Indoor Grill BG24,"I needed an indoor grill and was not sure what to get. I took a chance on this grill. It is extremely wonderful to grill steaks, chicken, and fish. I have enjoyed being able to gril indoors. It works great. The delivery process was quick. There were not any problems."
4,Quality Grill!!,Overall it's a GREAT product... 4 stars! I purchased the Delonghi grill after reading some positive reviews about it.I was so frustrated with my GF grills because they smoked up my entire kitchen and cooked unevenly.PROSThe Delonghi BG24 Perfecto Indoor Grill is made of solid materials and everything is dishwasher safe.It has temperature control and cooks food evenly without the smoke.Cooking meats on the Delonghi Grill is quick and easy but cleaning can be a little messy.CONSThe cooking surface is non stick but food has a tendency to stick to the surface which takes a few minutes to clean up.
4,It's not grilling but I like it,"Thing does a pretty good job. It isn't the same as grilling. The flavor isn't the same at all but it does a pretty decent job at cooking chops, burgers, brats, shrimp etc. It is a quick and easy alternative to firing up the grill and it cleans up very nicely. Seems that maybe it could be a little warmer but it still gets the job done."
1,disatisfied,"After Amazon shipped 3 of the Delongi BG24 Perfecto Indoor Grills, (the first 2 were damaged or incomplete) I tried to cook chicken on the grill. It never heated adequately enough to cook the chicken even on the high setting. I was very disappointed and returned it for a refund."
4,Indoor grilling,"I've been very happy with this grill. Just make sure you put water in thepan below so that you don't smoke the kitchen. Use approx. 3/4 of a cup.The cleaning is not that difficult because the finish on the grill is almosta non-stick. I just use hot water, soap and a dobie and have had no problems."
3,Can be helpful,"This product could have been helpful, but there were many mistakes within the book. I was reviewing for the French SAT II test with listening, and the answers in the back of the book were not correct. Although this tool can be very helpful and can help give you a feel for what the SAT II's look like, it has many errors and can lead you astray."
2,Just 1 sample test per subject,"The book gives a few tips that may not be easily found elsewhere, but mainly repeats info you've seen/heard if you've been checking into these tests. Then there's one sample test per subject, along with the answer grid; that's what makes it such a long book. As long as you know that's what you're getting..."
3,Complete Overkill.,"I bought the book thinking that it would be more for my money. And the truth is that it is more for money. A lot more. This book is huge! And unless you are going to take all of the subjects, it is too big to carry around. It is a lot easier to study from a lighter book, than this monster. I do recommend the series, but be reasonable and buy separate books."
3,BE CAREFUL,"i started using this about 4 days ago and started with just 2 tablets (not the recommended 3) with my meals 3x day. all ok, few times i went with the 3 tabs for supper but the rest of the day i only did 2, anyway no issues until about the 4th day- woke up at 2am with the worst feeling, not sure which end it was going to come out of - sorry to be gross. well needless to say, they should call this a 'stool liquifier' not a stool softner - understatement of the year!!! just use in moderation until you know how it effects you."
1,Absolutely aweful!,"I am not a huge Gwen fan but thought this CD would be fun. It is terrible. The second disc replays the same song 4 times in a row, each one a different ""mix."" Also thought the import would be cool and offer something different but was not impressed at all."
3,Nice stand.,"This is by far one of the best stands out on the market. It looks great and is fully adjustable. we bought this to play on the laptop from the couch easily. I would say my only complaint is that the base is a bit high up off the ground so it won't let the base slide under anything like a couch or something like that. I wish i had thought of that before i ordered it but that's my fault, not the stands. Would probably be good for a bed, but not a couch. So long as you're ok with that you'll dig this stand."
4,Attractive and versatile,"I've owned one of these little tables for 3 years and use it constantly. I'm using it as I type this on my laptop, lying in bed. I use it to work from home, pulled up to a comfy chair. It is very attractive, made of a dark rosewood-finished wood, with black leather-look pieces at the edges. Very sturdy and well designed. My only complaint is that for use in bed, it could be a bit longer. I have to lie right on the edge of the bed to use it for my laptop. But it is still the nicest-looking table of its type."
3,The Consultant's Guide to getting business on the internet,"This was a good book discussing the various newsgroups, e-mail signature files and gave practical information on how to access this data."
5,cordless iron,Have owned for 1 year now. Great product! Love the retractable base cord. Still working well.
5,"Finally, no cord!!!!!","I love this iron. My whole life, I've gotten tangled up in the dang cord. But no more! I got this iron 2 months ago and what a pleasure it is to use.Panasonic NI-L70SR Cordless Steam/Dry Iron w/Stainless Steel SoleplateI have no troubles with the iron not being hot enough. However, if you are the kind of person who never puts the iron back onto a tray when you adjust the clothing's position, the iron will get cooler. I like to adjust the item I'm ironing, pull it here, scoot it there and while I'm adjusting, the iron is back in it's caddy heating up. Usually only for 5-10 seconds, but that's enough I've used it to stay hot. I use it for clothes and for quilting. Works great."
4,Once you go cordless you'll never go back,This is the second cordless iron I've owned and I've never buy a corded one again. So far this iron is great. The first one I owned was a Black and Decker that lasted ten years. I hope this one lasts as long.
4,cordless iron,"Works great. However, did not realize that iron has to be placed in base to be warmed after each swipe. So still had to deal with cord issue of base plug. Just used extension cord. Still like it and it works well."
4,Good,"I love the no cord idea, nice iron, I only wish it would stay warm longer for ironing clothes. Works great for quilting."
5,love this iron,"I quilt, so I need a good hot steam iron and this one delivers.I had a Magtag cordless before and my new panasonic is 10 times a better iron."
4,cordless iron,"The cordless feature is very convenient. It is light weight and glide easily on the fabric. It gets very hot on the highest setting but even if replacing the iron on the cradle every time, by the end of ironing a full garment, it does not keep the high temperature. It will get back to it in less than a minute. It's a give and take between the convenience of a cordless and the performance."
3,Not designed with Lefties in mind,"This iron works as well as the 1972 Sunbeam Jewel that it is replacing. As a lefty, I feel the design is flawed, however. The release button is right where I put my thumb, which is distracting, and the cord comes out of the base in the direction that works well for right-handed people, but not left-handed. It wouldn't have taken any more effort to make the features of this iron more lefty friendly. I'm also suspicious of the retractable cord. It feels cheesy, like it might not last very long. Overall, it's easier for me to use than my old corded iron, and I intend to keep it."
3,Not hot enough,"I like the idea of a cordless iron, but I find it doesn't stay hot enough and I have to place it in the stand and wait for it to reheat more often."
5,Cordless Is Nice,I have used this iron for about two weeks and am very satisfied with it. I have needed to change my habits a little. I need to always put it back on the base when I am moving the item I am ironing so the iron stays heated. Being free of an electrical cord is very nice. Being able to remove the water refill container is very handy. The stainless steel soleplate makes it glide over the material.
3,"Great features, but not hot enough","I like the idea of a cordless iron, but I find it doesn't stay hot enough and I have to place it in the stand and wait for it to reheat more often than I like, especially when ironing linen."
4,Now that's an iron!,"This is about my fifth iron in 15 years, and I hope it'll stay awhile. In its first month, it's been easier to handle than corded irons, more reliable than a prior cordless, heats evenly and cleanly, doesn't drip (I don't have to mop up after I close the ironing board now!), stores nicely, and the reservoir works very well. It's a little slow to heat and cool for different fabrics, but tolerable, and to me the blinking-light/steady-light indicator is easy to use in recognizing it's ready to use. Way to go, Panasonic...!"
4,Cordless is Best,"This was purchased for my mother to replace an old (yard sale) Orrick cordless.Having grown accustomed to the absolute ease of cordless, she needed a new one and I chose this Panasonic NI-L70SR for her. First she thought it was too complicated, and maybe too heavy. Now she is delighted with it. So many features she never had before. She loves it! I'm thinking of buying myself one also!"
4,Just what I needed!,"This is just what I needed - no tangled cords & I can iron large items (table cloth, bed spread) in place rather than bunching them on the board & dragging them on the floor,"
5,"Great iron, great price!",This is a great iron! The steam is perfect. It is light weight and I love the retractable cord. We had a cordless iron but it broke. I wanted one that had good reviews but not a big price tag. Effortless iron. You don't have to press down and it stays heated very well for long periods (about 10 minutes or so) of ironing. Hubby really likes the iron and steam output. The heat is great without steam also. He uses it more than me and is very pleased with it. I use it occasionally and really like it also. I would recommend this iron for people who are tired of a corded iron that always hangs up.
5,No More Cords Getting Caught,"This iron was worth the price for me. Once you go cordless you won't go back to a traditional iron. I love that the cord doesn't get caught on the ironing board. The iron stays hot as long as I place it back on the base. Once you do one stroke instead of sitting the iron up (like a regular iron), just place it back on the base in between."
5,bought it again,"I am so pleased to get this wonderful iron at such a reasonable price. I had to throw out the previous model after a series of spectacular falls snapped a screw housing: we bought it April 3, 1999 so got good use from it. If this isn't a recommendation I don't know what is.I have a linen business, so it got heavy use. Love cordless."
4,Excellent product,We really like our new iron. The cordless aspect is very convenient and is very helpful for a left hander or if you are ironing big things like tablecloths. We may even purchase another one for travel in our RV.
2,Base doesn't keep this hot as promised,"The claim is that the iron will be kept at setting heat as long as you take the trouble to place the iron on the base whenever you reposition the garment.This is not true.I am finding that I need to actually turn it off and then turn it back up to the setting a few times each time I use it or it just loses more and more heat and you're left wondering ""why isn't this thing getting the wrinkles out?"".At this rate the buttons will wear out long before the iron should.It also takes a long time to heat up.I wouldn't recommend this iron.The best and longest lasting iron I ever used was a T-Fal I got at BJ's."
5,Best Iron I have Ever Bought !!!!!,"This is the best iron i have ever gotten. it's very well made and has a stylish look with the cover on it , i like the cover because it protects it from dust and dirt flying around.And it works fantastic !!!! the sole plate is stainless steel i believe and is easy to clean off the starch spray if you use it . it also has a feature where you can hold it upright and give your hanging clothes a ""blast"" of steam !!! i just love this iron and if you want a new iron , this is the one to get !!!!!!Laura Q."
4,Convenient-Actually Makes Ironing Tolerable,Heats up nicely. Good steam. Obviously the iron needs to be recharged periodically to maintain the proper temperature but this is easy achieved when moving the garment around to reposition it. Love that the water tank can be easily removed while the iron is still charging. So nice not to have to stumble around a cord. Makes ironing more bearable. Great product!
5,Panasonic cordless iron,"I love the portability since I sew. It doesn't get as hot as a corded iron, but I'm willing to trade a little heat for the convenience."
2,lasted just over one year,"I had this iron for one year and 3 weeks before the plastic on the front melted. I did like the cordless option, and it worked well while it worked, but I don't think I'll be buying another one. It seems like a $60 iron should last more than just past the warranty."
1,Iron Died!,"I purchased this iron in June, so it is six months old. Initially I loved it and the carrying case was great to help carry it back and forth between my sewing room and my dye studio. A month or so after I received it, the steam production decreased, which disappointed me greatly. When I plugged it in today, it was totally dead: no lights came on, no heat, nothing. I feel as though I was ripped off. I would never recommend this iron to anyone!"
2,good enough for two or three garments the most,"It was pleasure to work without the cord getting in the way... but the walk back and forth to the base is a killer. I think it is exactly as it was represented ""Very good for person on the move!"" The settings are way off reality ,I tried to iron silk shirt and it took me may be 30 min to play with it,nontheless running through all the settings in order to get somewhere to wrinkle free is not to be forgotten."
3,Works Fine,But you do have to keep docking it if you want it to stay hot. Since I tend to save up all my ironing it takes me longer than I think it should because I have to keep recharging it.
1,"Small, travel sized iron does not stay hot!!! Waste of money!","Iron is charged on base... takes about 3-4 minutes to get hot. Once removed from the base, the iron did not stay hot long enough to iron a pair of pants (and I am very quick at ironing)... You have to place the iron back on the base to charge all over for 3-4 minutes. The iron base has a very short cord so it is not convenient to have to keep placing the iron on the base to charge for 3-4 minutes for every item of clothing you need to iron. The steam does not work like described. It leaked water as it cooled. The size of the iron is equivalent to a small travel iron. I am returning this. Normally I would keep it and just deal with it, but this one is really that bad."
1,Panasonic iron,The iron is made in China and works briefly. You need to charge it continuously for the product to work.
2,I had to put it to charger every 2 minutes,"I read many reviews and compared a lot of products on Amazon, I finally decided to order this iron because the looking is very attractive and Panasonic is a good brand. I agree with most strength that other people observed. I like the cordless design. The size and weight of the iron are smaller than average. Every part is well made including the plastic cover. However, I had to recharger again and again, I could not complete pressing a cotton shirt in 5 minutes. The iron cool down quickly in the middle of working."
5,Go cordless in 2012!,"The panasonic cordless steam/dry iron is amazing. I absolutely love it and you can not believe what it is like to not have the pesty cord hanging over your shoulder. It charges while you arrange your article of clothing. I used it first time for two hours. Fabulous on the steaming part, and works wonderfully. Has a very strong steam coming out not weak like what I had before. Also as easy to change as changing a light bulb, a four-year-old could do it. Love the case also, so easy to store and will be buying for all mon children, grand-children and know they will be throwing out the irons with cords. I was worried about the price an it is a steal. Happy ironing!!! sallie newman"
2,marginal,"I am not sure why so many positive reviews. My experience has not been positive. Iron does not fit nicely into base. Kind of loose in there. It does get hot, but it does not stay hot for more than 8-10 seconds. Steam options worked fine. Mine lasted just over 1 year and that is it. I would not recommend or buy again."
4,cordless is better,Does what it said to do. On hot you can only iron one item (jeans). On medium you can iron two before you have to add water. The micro processor in the iron limits your heat time on reheat of the iron.
2,Doesn't stay hot long enough,"This iron gets very hot and steams well, too. However, it doesn't stay hot long enough. My old iron broke mid sewing project and I bought this. I couldn't even iron a 36 inch by 36 inch square before this iron turned off or lost it's steam power. So, I was constantly putting it back on the charger. Very disappointed because when it worked it worked well. Just not for long periods."
5,Panasonic Cordless Steam/Dry Iron,"I don't have a lot to say about this iron, but it makes me happy! The ease of not having to fight with a cord while ironing alone is a BIG plus. It works for me!"
5,Can we talk about my Love for this Iron!!,"Being the Mother of quite a few children, who have no regard or respect for such things. I was always going to use my iron only to have to go on a search and find missio. Then finding it it total disrepair. With either a tattered cord, or scorched bottom. When I purchased this iron (for my own use ONLY) I fell in love. The ironing surface is super and the cordless feature an absolute dream. It comes in a stylish carrying case and makes ironing a breeze. It is worth absolutly every penny it cost. I LOVE IT!"
5,Perfect for any Household,"This is not my first cordless Steam Iron, I have used several of them made my the same company, they are reliable and getting better every time when I change to newer model, within this past twenty years I have had total of four different cordless iron, this is by far the best I ever had. Don't know why in the U.S. not a lot of people notice this item."
1,Don't bother with this product unless you have all day to iron,"I first tried this iron on a silk blouse at the low setting. The iron did not hold its heat long enough to to iron more than one side of the collar. It also was not hot enough to get out the wrinkles, even with steam. The steam does not work well at this setting. After 10 minutes, I was still not done with the blouse.I then tried the medium setting on a polyester blouse. The iron was marginally better and I got both sides of the collar done before returning the iron to the heating element. It required me to use added spraying to get the wrinkles out and the blouse was not that wrinkled.The high setting was a little better than the medium setting. I still needed extra spraying to get out the wrinkles and the results were no where near the quality of my old steam iron. If you do not need what you are ironing to look crisp and well-ironed, this product might work for you, but I would not bother."
3,cordless iron,"If you are a quilter, the iron is always off when you need it. Even while you are using it, it is cooling off, so unless you lift it up and down frequently, it is not beneficial"
1,"Nice design, but cools off way too fast","This is my second cordless iron after my Maytag died suddenly few weeks back (lasted ~ 4 yrs). I chose this model given its higher wattage expecting faster heat. It may do so, but it cools off too fast and once off the cradle the light goes off and there is no indication if the iron is within the temperature range for the material.I'd go back to the Maytag for now."
2,Promising for not great,"I was very hopeful this would be a good purchase. It is definitely convenient being cordless but it just doesn't get hot enough. To get maximum heat, you just have to put it back on it's base and wait. Maybe I rearrange the garment too fast in between, maybe it just takes too long to get hot enough, maybe it just doesn't get hot enough, ever.Still keeping it. Returning and paying shipping just doesn't seem practical at this price range."
1,Worst iron I've ever used.,"I ordered the Panasonic cordless iron 2 months ago based largely on the good reviews here and I couldn't be more disappointed with my purchase. I'm baffled by the good reviews. How could anyone be happy with the performance of this iron? It works like the old fashioned black irons that people heated on wood stoves hundreds of years ago. Except this one doesn't hold heat like the ancient irons. Temperature control is non-existent and a ridiculous amount of time is wasted constantly reheating the iron. It seriously needs to reheat every few seconds, and even then it doesn't maintain a consistent temperature. I've already retired this 2 month old iron and purchased a new iron that is actually usable."
5,Great for senior citizens,I live in a small apartment and having the iron stored safely in its own case makes it easy to stash just about anywhere. The iron is lightweight and easy to use for arthritic hands.
4,Nice Iron .. but,"I really wanted to love this iron. I do love it being cordless, it makes it very easy to use.. but since I am a quilter I need an Iron that is going to get hot enough to take the wrinkles and creases out of 100 % cotton, and this Iron just can not do that. That being said, while it is not the best iron for ironing yardage of cotton, it IS a fantastic option for keeping handy to press seams while piecing !"
5,Best iron I've ever used,"Hubby and I lived in Japan for a couple of years and became obsessed with the ancient (10-15 year old?) version of this iron that we used while we lived there. Unfortunately we had to leave it there when we moved back to Canada, so I searched it out for our wedding registry. This (updated) model is even better! Whoever said that once you go cordless you will never go back--it's so true. Those that mention it doesn't heat up well enough, I wonder if they're leaving it on the base long enough? I've never experienced it not heating up well enough. I iron linen with it often, and it works wonders. The steam function is very cool, (although the 'dragon hiss' attracts the attention of my very curious kitty, haha). It is important that between uses--as you're adjusting the cloth on the ironing board--the iron gets put back into its base to remain hot.I agree with whoever said it doesn't leak or drip. I haven't had a problem with that yet!"
1,I sent it back!!!,"We needed a new iron and given the good reviews decided to buy this model.The charge doesn't last long enough to complete a short ironing session.Steam is very weak like if it wasn't there at all.I hate to return products, but my wife refused to use it after trying it a couple of times.Bottom line: if you want good results with your ironing I'd stay away from this model."
2,Steam Iron doesnt work,"I realized a bit late that the steam iron didnt work. And now I m wondering what can I do? I was out traveling for most of the year, and hardly used the iron.I wouldnt recommend this to others."
1,What's the point?,"After using this iron now for 6 months, I can't remember why I thought a cordless iron would be such a great idea. What is the point? If I thought a cord got in the way, I now KNOW that a recharging base REALLY gets in the way. To keep the iron hot enough for effective steaming and to iron about 90 percent of my clothes, I have to constantly return it to the base (which takes up about 1/2 foot of space on my ironing board) and wait for the blinking light to go solid again telling me that the iron once more is finally hot. During those moments I can't help but ask myself, ""why is this a better system than having a cord?"" It isn't!!!! Don't waste your money."
1,Water Tank Leaks!!!,"This iron gets used on a daily basis. The iron itself works great and the cordless feature is really neat - and I would buy another cordless iron again - JUST NOT THIS ONE!The problem is, this is the second iron we have gone through because after a year of use the adhesive used for the water tank has failed (micro-cracks in the adhesive develop - leaking water like a sieve). This also occurred on our previous iron as well. I originally thought the leak was a fluke, so I replaced with the same NI-L70SR. Sure enough after 14 months of use, this tank has started to leak (right after the one year warranty - figures).Because it is past the one year warranty - Panasonic Customer Service said there was nothing they could do. There is also no option to purchase a replacement tank so you must replace the entire iron.Spending $60 - $75 on this iron, I would expect it to last longer than one year - so consider this when shopping."
4,Good iron for a cordless,"I've had this iron for over 3 years now and I would say the biggest plus for this iron is its most obvious trait - that it is wireless. I usually have it sitting in the cradle. In the mornings, I would press the On button and switch it to the heat level I want. The light will turn from blinking red to solid red when it is ready. This takes about a minute. It gets out most wrinkles without much effort but I will say that a cord iron still seems to work slightly better. But, for me personaly, the convenience of it being cordless is the price I'm willing to pay.Also, the iron does loose the heat after a little bit, but I usually move the iron back and forth once or twice then place it back on the cradle for it to ""recharge"" while I am moving my shirt/pants to the next position. So that is not a huge inconvenience during my experience. All and all, it works the way it should and after 3 years, it's still going strong."
2,Its a good product i can say.,"I thought wireless might be more easy for ironing the clothes but not it not easy, infact I have pause after every 5 mins for 3 mins to heat up the iron. Not happy with this product though using it as I bought it for high price my bad for choosing wrong product."
3,Could be better,Is a good product but only good. I expected more. The heat keep going only a few seconds probably a minute and you have to put the iron again on the base to get recharge. After to many years puting the iron stand up on the table and having the same temperature all the time is dificult to remember to go to the base to keep the temperature as you like. I thought to send it back but I hope I will get used to.
5,Panasonic NI-L70SR Cordless Steam/Dry Iron,"You really must try this cordless iron. I have had a cordless iron before (a different brand) and loved it, but it did not have as big of a water tank as this iron. I just recently purchased this iron to replace my other cordless, but I will never go back to a corded iron again! P.S. I thought I should tell you that I do a lot of quilting so I do use my iron often..."
5,It's perfect iron i was looking for,"Hi,I found it best among the available iron. It's compact,cord free and very comfortable.It has has all the ergonomic features required for an iron."
1,Don't waste your money,"I totally agree with the other reviewer who advised not buying this document. First, it's only a few pages long, and certainly not worth paying money for. Second, the information is not anything special - it can be found on the web, where it belongs. It's merely a short article, and the first thing I've ever bought from Amazon that hasn't been worth the money. I am disappointed that Amazon would even decide to put such a short and 'thin' document on their website and sell it as a book. Can I get a refund?!"
4,Depends on Who You Are,"If you are someone trying to promote your website then you will benefit greatly from this book because it tells you WHAT to do. While companies are trying to sell you products to introduce meta-tagging etc. this book is trying to tell you that the paradigm has shifted to a new place via Google technology.I agree with others that you should not think this book will solve all your problems, but if you are not a search engine expert and you want to promote sites through search engines, this book will keep you going down wrong paths that are still being highly touted and promoted by companies wanting your money."
1,Better info on PR is available for free don't waste your $$$,This ebook is thin on useful info. You can find better info for free on the web. Don't buy this ebook.
1,A worthless collection of cliches??,"Not only can this information be found easily on the web and I have the strong impression that this (19 pages, with large letters) collection is not original at all. There are many much better books out there, like Google Hacks which offer real contents for your money.The website of this author has a very low ranking in Google itself and an email to the author, asking why, went unanswered...."
3,Okay Resource,"The tag line on this book is what attracted me and enticed me to purchase it: ""A guide for car campers who hate RVs, concrete slabs, and loud portable stereos"". The information about campgrounds was pretty accurate and has proven to be a useful resource, but the very first campground I chose from the book was nothing but one big RV campground. Loud stereos, campsites lit up like the fourth of July, and the constant hum of running RV were everywhere. I had to search long and hard to find a site that wasn't paved over and graveled over. Most of the spots were not appropriate for tents... which was a bit frustrating. However, I have found the book to be useful in helping me plan a last-minute getaway on my day off. I don't regret buying it, but I certainly hope I have better luck with other campgrounds."
5,"Awesome watch, now more affordable than ever","I always wanted to buy one but $600 price tag was a little bit high, so I watched this item and soon as the priced dropped down under $400 I pulled the trigger, I love it, its very durable, the quality of the watch is very good, I wouldn't say its as solid as my Tissot Quadrato but still this watch looks awesome, also you will love the touch screen and its world clock."
1,Didn't Work,"It seemed like a great watch, but unfortunately it didn't work. I have returned the watch for a refund."
4,An excellent self-help book,"This excellent book details ways in which we can invite nature spirits to work with us in creating a garden. The garden can be a plot of land with vegetables and flowers, or it can be a project for growing better relationships or for growing in our own inner wisdom.Everyone's class will be individually designed by and for that person. The average class takes 4 years.Nature can sort out its lessons in a more structured and orderly way when you let them know the parameters for your availability.This is an excellent self-help book, enriched by the author's sharing of her own path in opening to intuitive and spiritual awarenesses and learning to be a co-creative gardener."
3,He cracks Me up,He has some trip out Jams&just like the titles you gonna trip out on it from start to finish.i have had some of his hits for a few years&if you can get into his Grooves&vibe you gonna dig it.
2,What a waste of money...,"I bought two Bionicles for my son's stocking at Christmas. He is 5 so I had to help him put them together. It took forever to construct this sad little robot and within minutes of playing with it, it began to fall apart. The instructions are not clear and the overall durability just stinks. If your child just wants to construct them and display them, then this is great. If your child wants to play with them, forget it. Go buy a preassembled action figure and move on with your life."
5,chill out,"Kopaka-nuva has awesome armor and his mask is also.he has these two little blades that can split apart to go on his feet and turn into ski,s and he also has a shield and awesome armor so buy kopaka nuva today at toysRus."
2,I Beg to Differ,"Having previously read and enjoyed Light, perhaps I was just expecting something very different, but it was all I could do to get the end of this collection. Only a few of the stories can claim to involve elements of speculative fiction in any significant way, many of them are so similar in theme and structure it is hard to believe an editor had any input into selection, and much of the language ranges from baroque to fustian. While I read a lot of work by British authors, I can't recall ever being quite so lost in place-specific allusions. Harrison's references to the Midlands and northern England might as well be neighborhoods on Mars, although then I probably would not have felt like I was losing so much of the context. It has been about 40 years since I've read any Bradbury short stories, but towards the end of this, I considered picking up The Illustrated Man or R is for Rocket just to clean my palate."
3,Ok Kungfu movie,"Ok Kungfu flick .But definitely not among the best. Fights were ok , movie print quality was mediocre.Movie story line is not upto the mark and it has usual fare of action revenge. A no good hero practices some more kunfu and kills bad guy.If you have hour and more to time to kill and bored to death go ahead and pick this movie."
4,Fascinated.,"I've had an LP recording of Cosaro for many years and have always enjoyed it; the advantage of it is that you can emagine for yourself the sets and costumes. Seeing it on DVD for the first time I was appaled at how bad it really is. Mr. Novak, in his review, has said everything I was going to say. He does miss one point Damata's costume should have included a rather large ruby in her navel which would possibly have deminished the impact. Mr. Bruson's performance is not up to the standards of the rest of the cast, pity. Everything considered this is a very good performance of Verdi's worst opera and it is more enjoyable with the sub-titles OFF."
3,too hariy,all the fiber glass makes it really hard to get a smooth finish. even with Heavy sanding there were still little divets all over the place
5,Escape From Privet Drive Rocks!,"I just got this lego set. I saw it on Lego.com along with all of the other Chamber of Secrets Lego sets. This one is a good one. It provides the Harry Potter fanatic and Lego fanatic with our first look at Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's house Lego style. The set come with the house, the flying car, Ron, Harry, and Uncle Vernon. Plus, we get to see Harry and Ron in their Muggle clothes again. I'm disapointed though, because the set doesn't come with Fred and George Weasley, who were responsible for saving Harry from the Dursleys. But if you've got a few more Lego sets you can always take two other Rons and pretend that they are George and Fred. This set is definitely worth your money. If you are debating on whether to get this set or Hagrid's Hut for the same price, get this one. If you have a Dobby mini-fig, you can also act out the part where Harry meets Dobby among other scenes. Definitely get this one!"
4,Send in the owls!,"My 9 and seven year olds received several of the Harry Potter Lego sets and this was the easiest to assemble. They really should have included a Dudley figure and perhaps Fred and George to extend the fun factor. Once the structures are built,the figures help the action and imagination."
4,Harry Potter Escape From Private Drive,"I think the educational value of this toy is very poor, but it has quite a phenominal look and value. My personal opinion is it's a great present for a child of all ages, my overall scale of this toy is **** stars."
2,Gefen 4x1 DVI switcher,"Pros:1) Small2) ShinyCons:1) Cables hang out sides, very awkward. Makes putting on a stereo shelf look just plain ugly.2) The IR on this unit is a disaster! My Pioneer remotes make this unit switch DVI inputs. Then you have to flip these dip switches on your Gefen remote, then dips on the switcher...then try again! Arrrggghhh.Stinks. I will try another brand."
4,Basic white bowls,We ordered these bowls to supplement our primary set of dishes. These bowls gave us a great alternative to soup bowls and have proved sturdy unless dropped on concrete when our four year-old granddaughter was having ice cream. :)
4,White Bowls for Everyday Use,"Perfectly normal white bowls for everyday use. Nothing extraordinary nor any reason to dislike them. Stoneware, so that's a plus."
3,"Good Bowls, Bad Stacking","These are good bowls, but they don't stack properly. They stack in a way that makes you think they will fall over (and take up more vertical space than necessary). They also do crack over time, but I don't think we've broken any of them."
3,"Great songs, but...","The sound quality on this is atrocious. This was the only Belafonte I had for years (it was cheap and had all the ""hits""), so I thought all the reverb and muddy sound was normal, but I bought the ""Island in the Sun"" box set by Bear Family Records and it was like listening to the songs with new ears. Obviously (unfortunately) the box set is not for everyone because of its cost. Not sure how other compilations compare to this one, but I would recommend seeking something else out besides this."
2,"Bulky, Cumbersome, Overpriced","This is a good case, ""protection""-wise. The problem I had with it was the fact that it is really bulky. It adds at least 2-4 cm to the thickness of the phone. The headphone jack is covered by a pointless ""flap"" that is nothing more than a nuisance when you actually want to plug headphones in. It doesn't fit back in place when you want to cover the jack, either. I ended up cutting it off myself the 2nd day I had the case.Even without this pointless flap, the hole for the headphone jack is too small for any reasonable auxillary cable to fit in. Every time I was in the car and wanted to plug my phone into the stereo, I would have to take the left side of the case off just to plug in the Aux cable! With all of these problems, I ended up just shelving this ridiculous case and carrying my Bold around without any protection. $22 down the drain!"
5,perfect for my dogs,this is perfect for my 2 dogs who are outside most of the day. it is plenty big enough for my 30lb dog and my 15lb dog to sleep in together. we carpeted the interior just to make it a little cozier and the carpet has stayed dry through many rain storms (the dogs stay in our house when it rains). we also noticed slight gaps in the floor but I think they were put there on purpose for ventilaton. I really like that it is off the ground unlike dogloos. my dogs seem to like it and we love how cute it is.... everyone that has been over to our house says how spoiled our dogs are for having such a extravagant dog house.
1,So not worth the money,I've had this dog house for a few months. I just now put the dogs in it. I tried to move it today and it fell all to pieces. The wood is cheap. Already turning black. Its just terrible. Staples are the only thing really holding it together. You do have some screws. 4 fell out when I moved it. $400 dollars down the drain. I'm so disapointed. Please do not buy this product.
5,Rasing the bar for Improv Acting,"Carol is truly an amazing teacher. I've been waiting years for her book, and low and behold, here it is. Carol focuses on pulling a higher level of theater out of the genre of improv, raising the bar from silly throw away games to truly great acting. When I walk out on stage, I probably use the skills I've learned from Carol more than any other teacher's I've ever worked with. Acting on Impulse is a must own for any improv actor. - Christian, owner of IMPROVACTOR.COM"
3,A Very Hard Read,"I was quite dissapointed with the ambiguity and writing style in this book. I was hoping to use this as a guide to my vw repair and restoration but now it has taken the place amongst the ""last resort"" resource manuals for vw repair. The book seemed to magically jump from stage to stage of repair with no clear transition. After reading the section four times I'm still not sure how they got the car off the pan! The book was written using British colloqualisms and terminology, which was very hard for me to understand. On a positive note he does give a good introduction to welding and welding tools as well as other specialty tools used in classic car restoration. All in all I would say that given the chance I would return the book for a full refund and if I saw it for sale used somewhere I might pick it up if it did not cost too much."
3,Decent bet for what you pay,"For 20 bucks , I should say I am happy for what I paid.Pros :-PriceUSCHoody + a T shirtCons:-Size and fit is quite invariableQuality is not right up there."
2,passive solar letdown,"The author, in my layman's opinion, is too focused on the details. I think a lot of the laborious calulations could be greatly reduced into simple rules of thumb. However, I don't know where these rules of thumb are to be found, so to a certain extent, I have growned my way thru some of the calculations. One major concept I have rejected as not being worth the investment is the concrete block under the slab. However, the most influential concept has been the, in my case, estimate of thickness of the slab; rather than 4"", I chose 6""."
4,Buy This Book Before You Build,"An excellent resource for anybody who plans to build any kind of solar house. Several detailed (yet easy) design examples walk you through all the necessary heat gain and loss calculations which are necessary for all successful (i.e. comfortable and effective) solar structures. Many types of backup heating systems (including wood stoves) are discussed, including how they work together with the solar heating system. Lots of useful tables and other data in the appendices. This book focuses on a single ""solar slab"" design concept (which precludes the use of a basement), and only mentions other possible solar designs in passing. That said, it would be foolish to design a solar house without having this very affordable and excellent book in your reference library."
4,Useful,"Somewhat dated info, but useful and historically interesting. Apparently his floor system is no longer used. Similar floors with 12"" of concrete and embedded plenum and ductwork have been found to be more effective."
5,Great Cause Doll,I would rate this doll a 5 based on her beauty and the fact that she is a charity item. I like it when Mattel uses the famous Barbie to put light on special causes. Barbie arrived quickly and safely. She was also at a very good price. This is one collector who is thanful to have this doll in her collection.
2,Tediously finding out whatever happened to Jacy Farrow,"The tiny town of Archer City produced Larry McMurtry isn't that enough? I can only hope Ceil has purged herself from those Texas demons with this book and has now taken up skydiving or something other than writing. Gee, now I wished I hadn't found out what happened to her."
4,Mix Modern & Oldies,"Not the best but good very good. if it was out of 100 I would give it a 48.9! Good BEST VERTION OF DIG IT I'VE EVA"" HEARD"
1,Over 50 from Texas,"When I saw this movie - the first time - I vowed to buy the soundtrack. It is great fun - so is the movie. The review by Mr. Biker says it all. For another good soundtrack with some exceptional blues - get ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou."""
2,Disappointing,"This soundtrack is supposedly from the movie, but the score is not included. Only one song is in the movie in its entirety. Definitely not something I would recommend."
5,"Got DVD, Then Got SDTRK",This is a great soundtrack. There is a little bit of everything here like some country and Rock. I think Disney did A Great job and I'm looking forward to the next soundtrack!!!
4,good!,"This CD was good especially the song ""dig it"", it was the best song on this cd. With artist like shaggy and the song ""dig it"", this cd will sell a lot."
5,"Dig it, uh uh uh...","From the first pumps of bass to the last chord, this soundtrack is F-U-N. The music captures the spirit of the movie (and book) brilliantly. The first track, a mix of rap and song from the young stars of the movie, forces a smile to the sourest of faces. The two tracks by the Eels are catchy, too. But by far the best song is the Fiction Plane track, ""If Only."" Never have I heard a 3+ minute song translate an entire book like this one does. The melody is at once lovely, melancholy, hopeful, and light. A true joy."
5,GOOD ALBUM!!,"I liked this album a lot. Especially the songs, ""Dig It"" and ""Eyes Down."" They go great with the movie, that's in the theater, April 18th. Caveman(Stanley), Zero(Hectar), Zigzag, Armpit, X-Ray, and the other D'Tent boys from the movie sing ""Dig It"". Eels sings ""Eyes Down"". In colclusion this album is very good, and I recommend that you buy it if you like the movie."
5,Super-duper Soundtrack,"First of all, Holes is an awesome movie and the soundtrack is just as awesome! The songs are great, especially D-Dent Boy's song!"
1,Michigan Big Ten Hat,I returned this hat because it is pictured with gold embroidering but the color when it showed up was an obnoxious neon yellow. This is the second time that I have tried a Michigan hat from Amazon with the same results. I will be not be trying it again.
5,The place to store your memories!,This is a beautiful photo album that has held up the constant beating of a two year old. It is sturdy and beautiful.
5,nicely organized and thorough,"Addresses many topic in data management including distributed databases, relational databases, heterogeneus database integration, data warehousing and mining. As a scientist I got a very good overview of data management."
4,"Good Shoes, Good Value.",I bought these shoes based upon other customer reviews. What I got was an excellent product. Better than the $60.00 I spent on a pair of Nikes somewhere else. Those were inferior.The construction is flawless and it gives good support albeit a little too much at the balls of the feet. Nonetheless for the money I can't complain. I am impressed by New Balance and will buy a pair of shoes from them through Amazon again.
4,AB Quintanilla delivers another great record,"I really enjoyed this CD. It's the first Kumbia Kings cd that I bought. I mostly bought it because it had 'Don't wanna try'-Frankie J on it. Well took it home, listened to the whole cd that night. Really enjoyed it. Even though their other cd's are mostly in spanish, this one is all in english. It has a bit of everything, pop, rock, r&b and rap. Great mixture, A.B Quintanilla has delivered another masterpeice. This is one amazing song writer and producer."
5,Coming of age story of the highest order,"The author combines memoir, travelogue and coming of age story forms to take you with him on a sad but incredibly funny journey with his alcoholic, grass-is-always-greener father. The facts are heartbreaking but the boy is gonna make it and you know that as you go with him. If you having any wanderlust you will be looking out the window after reading this book. The writing is first-rate with memorable passages. I read half of the book before leaving the bookstore! It didn't hurt that he starts his journey in Albany, which happens to be my home, getting all the details right as he heads to California. But all the rest is purely universal. A must read."
5,Review,"I am a retired PI in Seattle. I have had the pleasure and privelage to know Gene and his wife Linda over 15 years.When it comes to surveillance, no one can hold a candle to The Robertson Group. I was a Criminal Investigator in the U.S. Marines and a Special Agent with NCIS, but Gene is the expert in surveillance.I recommend this DVD without any reservation."
2,Does Not Teach Surveillance,"While the author seems like a helpful and nice person, I cannot recommend this tape to anyone because it will not teach the unexperienced how to conduct surveillance. If you have the experience I doubt you would want to watch this tape because more advanced skills are not taught here and the technology reviewed must have been improved since this tape's release."
2,Save your $$$,"I was SO looking forward to this CD, given that the first one blew me away. With the exception of just a couple of tracks, this one just blows. It's as if they are trying to shelve all the anger that made the first disc so appealing and are trying to be ""legit"". Yawn. Pick up Mudvayne's latest instead."
4,Best Soundtrack ever!!,"I love this soundtrack!! My favorite songs are: Dream,Dream,Dream by Shark boy, The lala's and Shark boy and lava girl by The Lavagirls!!"
4,My children love it,This movie keeps my 2 1/2 yr old still for the entire movie.My kids ( 2 1/2 & 4 1/2 yr old) love this movie and keepstheir attention for the length of the whole movie.
5,indeed my nipples have trippled in size,"one of there best albums musicly you could tell they were really well formed in this album unlike ""soak the saddle"" with alot of just random noise of maddness, truely one of the best"
2,Cheap,"I bought this when I got a new car. I had one on my last car that was great. This one was bigger and cheaper feeling. Where my last one had the adhesive pad covering the entire back of the emblem, this one just had two pieces of double stick tape. When I put it on my car, I instantly knew it would not work. I pulled it off and threw it in the trash."
4,Entertaining,"Very entertaining, the second of Ms Parks books that I read. Enjoyed the story, good ending, some silly nonsense, but typical of this genre. Would recommend to any one who enjoys Regency romances."
4,Great high school graduation gift,"As a mom of 2 high school girls, one senior, I started to feel helpless thinking about college. I have always overseen the health care of my daughters but how would they know how to take care of themselves without me? Along comes this book--from heaven! It covers every topic under the sun and more. The book is funny and light, but deals with real issues. My 17 yr old glanced at it--and an hour later, she was still reading. I think this book will be a hit and a great gift for girls going off to college."
5,Today Show author! Great book.,"Loved this book! I just saw the author on the Today show where she talked about binge drinking and the use of attention deficit disorder drugs on college campuses. Both of these are growing problems today, and she addresses these issues super well on tv and in the book.As seniors in high school, some women don't realize the challenges that will face them in college. This book gives women the tools to face any issue that comes their way. It's like having mom and a doctor on your shelf when you need them!"
4,Wall Street Journal review gives thumbs up!,"I read a great review of this book in the Wall Street Journal and decided to buy it. I was very happy that I did. Parents need to be aware of the challenges facing their daughters as they go to college and this book did a smash up job going through each health concern and giving well thought out tips. The author spends a great deal of time elaborating on health concerns specific women and teaches how to recognize warning signs with good advice on how to prevent and treat, if necessary. My only complaint is that some of the advice seems obvious, but what's obvious to one person may not be obvious to another."
3,"slides off chair, motors wear through fabric","doesn't really stay on the chair for a sloucher like me. the control falls out of the holder often. heat function is nice. doesn't really massage, just a bunch of vibrating motors. better than nothing!"
5,Wonderful Back Massager,My husband hurt his back so I bought this for him and he absolutely loves it. We are thinking about buying another one since we fight over who gets to use it.
2,Nice.. but not a massage,I LOVE massages... this doesn't massage.. it vibrates.. I am not saying it doesn't feel nice.. but it doesn't do much to get rid of the tight tense muscles.. so depending on what you are looking for... if you just want something that will make your 15 minutes of sitting feel nicer.. this will work.. otherwise.. save your money.
2,wee.,"It just vibrates. Not much to it. It got out nothing, it didn't really do anything... except make me feel like I had a neuropathy starting."
5,The only way to fly!,"I recently worked at a craft fair for a friend. She had brought her Back Therapist with her and put it in one of the chairs in the booth. I spent 3 hours luxuriating in the heat and the massage. The only problem I had was that when I stuck the remote into the cup holder on her chair, it kept turning the unit off. I'm going to dash out and buy one for my husband!"
4,Great guide for travelling with little ones!,I ordered this book to get an idea of what we could expect at Universal. This is a great book to have before and while you are there. We saved time and money with the book. There are a few minor errors but things change so I will assume that is why. We travel with 4 kids ages 2-13 so planning is important to say the least! A great time was had by all and we definitely would not have had such a successful vacation without the preplanning this book allowed.
5,This is a GREAT toy!,"I purchased one for each of my grandchildren and they both love them. So does their mom, especially when they are in the car and quietly playing instead of the usual bickering. I would highly recommend this fun way of learning."
2,"Good Concept, Bad Marketing and a Money Pit","This is a good educational concept...BUT... The Brain Quest does NOT work with the cartridges that you buy at the store. You have to buy a cartridge programer ([$$$]) plus blank cartridges ([$$$]) and subscribe to the web site ($$) to get the downloads, plus more.Bottom Line: A MONEY PIT.Look at Sony and Nintendo. They use the same concept and they keep compatibility among their systems."
4,"Great, educational toy!","My 6 yr old is very interested in learning to spell and this has helped him. He especially likes the missing letter game. There are many levels to conquer before cartridges become necessary. Those just broaden the learning experience without having to buy another complete toy! LeapFrog toys have been very popular with all my kids(6, 4, 3) and have helped in them in learning independently."
3,Missing Earlier Hits!!!,"This collection is ""just okay."" It's missing ""Never Underestimate the Power of A Woman,"" ""Multi-Purpose Girls,"" which was never released and which was written and produced by Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, ""Wild Girls"" also written and produced by Jam & Lewis and/or ANYTHING else from the tight and funky first two albums; a disappointment in my opinion. It could have been better compiled and all inclusive of their short-lived career. It might have also included some ""solo"" hits (Bernadette, Fenderella, etc...) and perhaps even something from Madame X; ""Just That Type of Girl."" I'll just call it incomplete for lack of a better word."
4,Strawbs Sampler,"As other reviewers have pointed out, Deja Fou seems to represent the Strawbs in all of their phases, from folk-rock beginnings to prog-rock heyday and pop-rock aftermath. It also has a vibrancy and freshness (with its unusual snake-charmer rhythms, NRG may be the most ""progressive"" track on the disc), and indeed it's good to hear this lineup together again after a 30-year absence (I only wish there was more of John Hawken). Personally, I like the cover art---it's retro and in that sense befits the music."
3,Interesting career overview,"Despite the fact that this lineup is the same as the classic prog ""Hero and Heroine"" days, only the intro track and ""Under a Cloudless Sky"" really echo those times (and although I like the song a great deal, it's a little too close in structure to ""Ghosts"" for my tastes). As other listeners have mentioned there's a bit of all the different eras of the band here, from Dragonfly to Burning for You. Overall it's a pleasant nostalgic stroll, and a huge improvement over the ""Blue Angel"" CD from a few years ago. It definitely proves the Strawbs are still a viable band, capable of making music that captures the mind and moves the heart. Just don't let the legendary stature of the ""Hero and Heroine"" combination of musicians inflate your expectations too much."
2,Not worth the wait,"If anyone was expecting a work line Hero or Ghosts it sounds like those days are long gone. The first thing that strikes you is the production quality. This disc sounds like it was recorded in someone's home studio. The best content comparison for this disc would be Dragonfly. It's about 75% acoustic and really drags on. To be fair I've only listened to it twice but I find only one up tempo song to my liking-""Under A Cloudless Sky"". Banjo is used to nice effect in some of the songs and the lyrics are as always well written. Honestly this does not hold up to the standards of the classic Strawbs songs to this 70's Strawbs fan. I would rate this in the category of Nomadness..a dissapointing effort at best."
2,As a future teacher...,"All I can really say about this book is that it is so impractical. Percoco outlines many techniques that have worked in his classroom; the techniques range from giving students clay and allowing them to make whatever they like, without giving any historical context, to writing about their emotions associated with traveling over bridges, to discussing 90210 during a unit on World War II. I'm sure the book is great if you live in a district that allows teachers to set kids loose on field trips and arranges internships for each of them. I'm sure it's great if, like Percoco, you can hand-pick students for your class. Some ideas are usable,but for the most part, neither I nor anyone else in my class found it to be of much help."
4,Works Well At a Good Price:,"I recently purchased this stick holder from Amazon using my Prime membership. The item arrived within 2 business days even though I it was ordered late in the day!I am happy with the performance of this item, though for me it has one minor limitation; the large size of the ""chip-clip"" the stick holders are attached to limit the angles to which they can be rotated. If you like to keep those spare sticks low on the hi-hat stand at a steep angle for quick retrieval, this will likely bother you just a little bit; if you use this holder in a more vertical orientation you'll never notice it. It holds two pairs of sticks securely, yet loosely enough to get to in a hurry. I plan to purchase another, so I can have one on both sides of the kit.All in all, a well made product that does it's job. Very satisfied."
5,get at least a couple,"I love these things and have several of them...not only are they great for the obvious use, they are quite easy to stick in various places on a percussion set up to hold specialty sticks, scrapers and strikers..."
2,not sturdy,"It will hold your sticks well, but when you clamp it to your hardware stands its not a secure as you would think it to be. I feel like if I drop my sticks in a gig and i need to grab a pair from these holders and I push against the holder while taking the sticks out it will come off. I am going to be tapping this to my hi hat stand."
4,Adjustable,I have an electronic drum set without cymbal stands. I was worried if I could clamp this anywhere. I can.
1,Don't Bother,"The bottom of the bed may be made of a rugged, waterproof material, but the zipper is cheap. One of our dog's suffers from occasional separation anxiety when in her kennel. I thought this bed would stand up to her fits. We weren't gone more than 30 minutes and she had the entire zipped destroyed."
1,More Beginning OO than UML...,"My rating is based on the comparison of the book's title to its content. I was expecting an advanced book on the UML for the seasoned developer based on the title.What I got was a beginner's introduction to OO develelopment. In fact, the authors state on page 293 in the Afterword:We've tried to keep this book simple. [...] If this book helps you get a feel for OO development and makes it possible for you to generate diagrams [...], we've done what we set out to do.Don't be tricked me into purchasing the book by the misleading title. UML is discussed, but not in depth. If you're new to OO development, this book may be a good introduction. It also gives a fairly good introduction to the UML.But a better book for just an introduction to UML is:UML Distilled: applying the standard object modeling language by Martin Fowler with Kendall ScottAnd for a more in-depth book, I liked:The Unified Modeling Language User Guide by the three amigos"
2,Poorly Written,"While I'm sure the authors knew exactly what they were talking about, they did a truly poor effort of communicating the subject to the audience. Case in point: they spend the first 5 or so chapters mostly talking about what they will cover later on in the book or how a different topic (like Java) pertains to UML - and they'll talk more about it later. Few diagrams or examples were available, and those present aren't explained terribly well."
1,Very poorly written.,"I was VERY disappointed in this book. I was very surprised to see other reviews praising this work. I found it's presentation very superficial and confusing. If possible, I would have given it a lower rating."
2,"OK intro to UML, dissappointment overall","Although I was able to get a reasonable understanding of UML notation and how/when to use certain UML diagram types, the book was quite a dissappointment overall.The authors spend way too much time on analysis methods that (admittedly) have no representative UML diagrams. Although they state clearly that UML is purely notational and does not imply/condone any particular methodology, they proceed to introduce a ""generic"" methodology of their own, and spend most of the book explaining it and using it to develop a simple ""application"".Without doubt the most dissappointing thing about this book (to me) is the joke of an application developed by the authors. For a book subtitled ""The Developer's Guide, with a Web-based application in Java"", I actually laughed out loud a few times at example source code.Sorry, guys, this book could've and should've been much, much better."
4,"James Harriott meets the Buddha, in every day life.","James Harriott meets the Buddha in this New Age tale, the suffering and death of a bulldog, Faccia Bello, lead his master, physician Fischer, to a recognition and understanding of the spiritual fabric of everydaylife."
1,wrong color item,"The item they sent wasn't the color I ordered. Not a big deal, but the inside of the case seemed rough (scratchy) and I was concerned that it would scratch the lens on my flip mino. I ended up giving it to my nephew for his phone."
4,"Works well, small and fairly low profile","I purchased this case to keep the Mino inside of a large purse. The case is protective and has a clip which I attach to the inside of a bag.The profile seems a bit large for the Mino, but since it is spacious, the Mino gets great protection from other items in my purse. And the clip on function really makes me feel safer becasue I never close my purse.Color options are great too."
1,Zipper broke after two weeks,"It was a great purchase, before the zipper broke two weeks in. It can be fixed, by sliding the zipper back and forth a few times, but then breaks again. This defeats the purpose, no? Not recommended. Spend a little more and get a nicer carrying case."
2,Its a holster,"What's to say, it holds the mino camera, it is attractive, and does what it was designed to do. But let's not make it more than it is."
1,Cheap Zipper,"The case was pretty hard and would protect well, no padding or anything so camera would bounce around in it. The Zipper got stuck everytime I opened or shut it and on the third time busted completely so I returned it. It did have enough room for memory cards and cords but I wanted something to protect camera only, so I went for a smaller case."
4,love it,"I put my canon camera, extra battery and mem card with room for my car key and lipgloss. Almost like a small purse. Lightly padded to protect the cam and has a strap to secure it inside. a good buy!"
3,Not exactly what I expected,"Case was a bit too big for my new compact camera, wouldn't fit in pocket well. Caribiner clip broke after 1 minor touch from my friend's 5 year old. I was able to replace it with a better clip I had. Also ended up paying a bit more than I expected with all the S & H charges. Ended up getting something better at a nearby store for almost a quarter of the price."
2,way too big,"This product is much bigger and bulkier than I expected. The canon camera swims inside this case. It is heavy duty and it is nice that you can store extra batteries and other accessories. This product is also difficult for easy accessibility. The camera is strapped in and then zippered shut, not the quickest way to take pictures."
3,Umm - $35.99 for 4 episodes?,"It is a good series, but honestly - why so pricey? HBO doesn't even charge $9 an episode!"
3,"Good, But A Tad Overrated","Shining Force CD is not a bad game, but it doesn't quite hold up to the other games in the series. Gone are a lot of the story line and role playing elements that made the other games in this series so engrossing. Since this is a remake of the portable Game Gear Shining Force games, this isn't too surprising.I found myself getting bored about mid-way through and never completed it. If this was inexpensive, or you just have to complete your Sega CD collection, then go for it. However, the Sega CD will happily play burned games and the used price is really getting high on this one. You might want to try before you buy here."
2,This ain't no book!,"This cd contains narrations by Bruce Heighley wich are quite nice but superfluous for Harry Nilsson fans.The christmas songs performed by Harry are terrible. His voice is in bad shape.I think the songs are recorded just after the pussycats album. Harry damaged his voice during the recording of that album (thanks to John Lennon).If you are a true Harry Nilsson fan you must have this cd because it contains 5 tracks you can't get anywhere else. If you don't want to be dissapointed and want to have a nice christmas-cd than skip this one and buy the christmasalbum by Mariah Carey, Christina Aguilera, the Moody Blues, Steven Curtis Chapman or Neil Diamond"
1,I don't think too Heighley of it,"Only 8-1/2 minutes of Nilsson, then a LOT of blather from this prim and priggish Princeton pupil ""Bruce Heighley"" who takes himself WAY too seriously and is not fit to lick the floor where Harry Nilsson puked. Well, Nilsson's songs are not terrible, and if you'd like the comfort of his voice wrapped around a few Christmas snippets, go ahead and throw your cash at this thing."
3,A Little Touch of Schmilsson for Christmas,"The Presence of Christmas was originally sold on LP by mail order. The album of Christmas stories, produced by Harry Nilsson's cousin, included instrumental recordings of traditional Christmas songs. Later, Harry Nilsson recorded vocals over the existing orchestral recordings and the album was reissued as an ""audiobook"" and on CD.There is some charm to the stories and, although Nilsson's performances are uninspired, it's still great to hear him.An original Christmas song by Harry Nilsson is heard in Ziggy's Gift, an animated Christmas special with music by Harry's friend, Perry Botkin.-- Roger (harrynilsson.com)"
3,it's alright,"Sponge's latest album The Man is just an average cd. I like the old Sponge lineup better. All I can really say is that overall The Man is better than their last album, For All The Drugs In The World."
5,A great lego set,This is a great set if you like Harry Potter and to build my mom and dad liked this set even better than i did it might have taken me two hours to build it but it was worth it i bet this is the best set yet!!!
2,Distorted Memories?,"This short book has some nice photographs but leaves the reader with many inaccurate and counterfactual impressions of the marvellous Can-Am series of the 1960s and 1970s. For instance, McKinney, an apparent fan of the big-budget turbo Porsches, asserts that the McLaren team was lucky to win the 1971 series. This is obviously a second-hand impression that contradicts well-known racing facts as presented, for instance, in Pete Lyons' excellent Can-Am books. The turbo Porsches were fascinating but actually inefficient and heavy pieces of machinery.This book is written from a biased viewpoint since the McLaren team won 8 of 10 events in 1971 and Revson beat Stewart, who at the time was at the top of his form. Also, the book's organization and layout are unbalanced as the size of the photos and text placement vary in an erratic fashion, giving a less than professional appearance. I would recommend this book for Can-Am collectors but not for racing historians."
3,wu tang affiliate group,"the first release of Inspecktah deck's ins productions, is not a great one. not much publicity, and the album is not the greatest, jazzy rhyme is a good track though, and if you collect wu albums this is a rare album to have in your collection"
4,Practical advice for building an office,"This book can get you thinking about how to design medical and dental spaces. The advice is very practical, and the examples given instruct you in practical applications of the advice. I used this edition as well as the 2002 edition to plan a 4000 square foot family medicine clinic. There is little difference in the two editions."
5,Shower Curtain,"Love it and so does everybody else. I am a snowman nut, have over 150 of them in all shapes and sizes."
1,This shower curtain left me cold.,Imagine my surprise when I opened the Snowman Holiday Shower Curtain to find it in an Oriental Trading package. Then imagine my disgust when I went to the Oriental Trading website to find that they sell this very cheap looking shower curtain for only $11.99 and I paid $21.00. Buyer beware!!!Snowman Christmas Holiday Winter Fabric Shower Curtain
5,Snowman Shower Curtain.,Matched all the other Snowman products ordered. It was easy to hang and easily kept. WIll look forward to hanging it again next year.
5,truck shock absober,Shock was of better quality than the factory units. Item was easy to install. Raised front of van up aboutone inch. Ride and handling have increased.
1,wrong item,"Though I cannot speak of quality, I can say a word about fitment. It does NOT fit.The OEM belt is double-sided, and this one has groves only one one side, like most belts are. Due to this, I could not use it and had to return. Unfortunately ""OEM Quality"" sometimes means ""Try your luck"" and not equivalent to OEM spec."
3,Okay... but not great,"This book is very straight forward, but one thing it lacks is examples. Being that I myself am a visual learner, it would help in learning the accounting process if there were more examples to go on and practice. I'm not totally satisfied with this book. Do I recommend this book? Sure, if you're a CPA and understand the text."
2,"Interesting Subject, but the writing is Putrid!","I am interested in all the women of the monarchies around the world. But I would like to be presented with the information I desire in a clean, flowing way. Into the author's mind the information goes; jumbled it comes out. Has this guy even graduated 10th grade English? But, beside that, I see a promising young artist. I am expecting to see more verbiage, though, before anything of worth is produced. Thank you for reading my review."
4,"""Ethnic"" doll cost more....?","Great doll....however, Why is the African American baby more expensive....its the same doll as the non ""ethnic"" doll just a different color....... ? I just dont think that is right...would like an explanation ...."
1,Very Upset Mother,I am very upset that the Baby Annabell ETHNIC is not available in any of the 9 local stores around Atlanta Ga. A lot of the managers white and black both made the statement that this doll was available before Christmas but now you can't find it. Whats up with that? I think ZAPF Creations need to change there policy. Whats up with not having the ETHNIC doll on your own personal web site? Why does it say no longer for sale? I will not be buying any dolls from ZAPF Creations.
4,Both my daughters love it,"I bought this daughter for my 5 1/2 yr old for Christmas and we all love her. My 16 yr old played with her as much as my youngest. It is a little hard to get the water in her so that she can cry, but as she is sucking we squeeze the bottle. Everyone that came over our house Christmas day thought she was the best present ever. We all enjoyed her. We even like her name although it is a mature name. However, it's a tribute to my daughters great-grandmother and bestfriend, Isabell and Anabell, so we decided not to change the name. We really love this doll. I too was concerned that it was more expensive than the caucasian doll, but I got it on sale, so I got it for the same price as the other one. I and my daughters are happy with my purchase."
5,Rocko!,"Shout factory is releasing some amazing stuff,and I'm glad they're digging into the old Nick library. Rocko holds up rather well after all this time, and I'm looking forward to buying season 2."
5,Wonderful Learning Tool,My daughter got the Quantum Pad for her 7th birthday and just loves it. I think if a child is a good reader all the books are good... even the math is inspiring her to move forward with it although she isn't at those levels yet.She spends 3 - 4 more hours a week on the Quantum than on the TV or her Game Boy but more time on the internet than all of them. It's a great addition to learning.
5,Ashley,"I got the Quantum Pad for Christmas. It's a really cool toy. It's good for long trips in the car. It keeps me busy. The sample book that comes with it has some neat games in it that I really like. It also has pages on the solar system, which I like a lot. There is a special marker and eraser that use on the books. That's pretty cool."
1,Only reads every other page...if your lucky,"I have tried several sets of new batteries and still does not work properly. When my son turned on the system it would sometimes worked when you clicked go and sometimes it just made a clicking sound. When it did work it would only let you read every other page. Sometimes it would not let you start from beginning of book but would work if you went to the middle. Very confusing and frustrating to get to work. My patience is running thin. I was hesitant about buying one since the displays in the stores did the same thing, however I thought that they were probably abused so I went against better judgment. Looks like it would be a wonderful learing tool if it worked as presented."
3,BROKE BY DAY 2,We bought this for our 7 year old for X-mas and by day 2 it no longer worked. We have tried replacing the batteries and reading the trouble shooting instructions but still no luck. It looks as if we will have to return this and the books (which really add up in price) We were disappointed.
4,To Leap or Quantum Leap?,"This is a question actually, not a review. I have a Leappad and several of the Leappad books/cartridges which I understand work on the Quantum Pad. The question that I have is this, do the Quantum Pad books and cartridges work on the Leappad as well?"
1,no books to find for kindergardeners,The book is supposed to be great...so long as you can find accessories to it. And that is a hassle--no books for kindergardeners to find anywhere [...] What was the point of spending [...] to purchase the station if there are no books to use it with?
2,The Badest Toy but edcational,"This toy is not safe for other children, the batteries keep running out every time i play for 20 minutes how rude. That's why i don't play my leadpay no more cause mommy saids i'm to busy honey i can't go out and buy some sorry. Where ever I touch the leapad said something wrong and wrost of all I get something right it saids its wrong and once you play for like 5 days it bores you already.... stop selling this!!!!!!!! but its kind of fun once you learn something you never knew and it talk so this is not to boring. This should be in schools why not"
1,Learning System,"I choose this low rating because the system arrived in a smoke filled package. I don't know if it works or how it works, the smoke was offensive. This item is a used Quantum Learning Pad System highly regarded for helping children become more knowledgeable, self confident and well rounded in school. The system has its own quantum books and cartridges as well as a parent guide which allows the parent to know how their chid is progressing and where or if help is needed. It is said to be very helpful for little people to do better in school by showing them an easier and fun way to learn. I would not have purchased this item had I known about the smoke."
5,My preschool thru junior high kids all love this,"I bought the Quantum Pad rather than the LeapPad as the colors seem less childish. I usually don't buy ""fad"" toys, but this was an great investment in my kids' education. Everyone from the 14-year-old down to the 3-year-old love to play with this.This can and does go anywhere, as opposed to our personal computer. We've taken this to piano practice, in the doctor's waiting room, and on car trips. A pair of earphones is essential for quiet play - the sounds drive my husband up the wall! ...."
5,My kids love this toy,"The toy is excellent. The books are very educational, and new books are coming out all the time. We got hours of quiet play out of this. It is very portable and travels well (great for airplanes).Our only problem is now after 2 years of constant use, the pen has begun to short out. I cannot find information about replacement parts. I am considering purchasing another one, but am writing to the company for replacement part information before I go to that expense."
3,Ok but Child lost Interest,It seems like it is a good system but my young son lost interest after we tried it a few days. He is hyper and energetic and only learns from using personal interests.
2,"Good, but not that good","Although this book was created by The College Board, they do not give you the important information that's needed to be successful on the test. I recommend booklets from Kaplan, Barron's, or The Princeton Review. Or any other brands.I bought this book in hope that I will get good information, but it's too packed up with all of thte SAT Subject tests with brief info for each and practice tests that it hardly focuses on the subjects you will be taking on the exam. The SAT Reasoning booklet is very comprehensive and worth buying, but this book is NOT.I still have this book with me, but I don't recommend it to others. It's a good thing I bought it for a cheap price, but I think other reference booklets will be more helpful."
5,The Life of Mother Teresa,This is an excellent book about the life of Mother Teresa. I knew that she had to wait 12 years to start her missions. I did not know what life was like for her for those 12 years until I read this book. It is an excellent book for those who suffer along the path that they believe God is leading them without sight of the end. This book also shows how important it is to rely on God alone for our needs and how in His time he will provide for those needs. Our ways are good but His are perfect!
4,Unabashed sincerity,"My Solo Project may not be the uniquely quirky, synth-based duo's most polished effort, but this worthy debut shows pop mastery in spades from the get go. At times a dueling shout-sing delivery grows weary, but these Mates never let any repetition set in before another infectious emoting hook takes hold. A brief, but bold and diverse enough burst of positivity to belong in any indiefile's collection."
3,If you like this...,"Try Papas Fritas self titled album...very good indie pop that is playful, and addictive. Trust me on this one."
1,"Good in therory, not in practice.","Well the book seems to give great advice on paper, but after using his tonics and potions, all my plants took sick and most got bugs and died.I used to do very little for my plants. I fed them plain old tap water and ignored them much of the time and they looked great.I think my plants got bugs because he suggests that you use food items in your potions such at tea and cola. The sugar attractedaffids or something and they ate all the roots. So very sad 'cause I had had these plants for years and I was attached to them."
4,"Happy, Healthy Houseplants by Jerry Baker","The ultimate guide to the living with plants in your home. There is an interesting section on how to select plants, based on your personality and taste in home furnishings. Thorough advice is offered on plant growing and maintenance. The section on trouble shooting plant problems is well organized and easy to use. Full of good humor and practical information."
2,Expensive!,"Comparing to other PCAT materials, why is this book so expensive? It is twice the price of most of the available PCAT review books. If anyone already bought the book and took the test, would you please let me know how relevent is this book to the actual PCAT?Thanks!"
1,hardwired,Be sure to read the whole description as this hairdryer has to be HARDWIRED in and not just mounted on the wall and plugged in.
4,"Performs well, lasts about 5 years",Seems to work fine (as in wife likes it). She uses a mesh-like diffuser over it. They seem to burn out after about 5 years.Be sure to order the right version -- either with a plug or with a whip prepared to hardwire. The hardwired version has a specific place for the electical box.
1,Read the Product Info,"This one is going back, can not be installed. It is a HARD WIRE model, which is described in the PRODUCT INFORMATION!"
1,Recieved a small hand held black Micro,Andis MicroTurbo with this model number on the outer box - not even close!Andis 30095 Micro Turbo 1200 Watt Hair DryerWebsite picture of the the picture and description is misleading.
3,andis hangup hair dryer,I was not too impress with Amazon .com or the product this time...First I ordered once and nothing ever came had to cancel that order and reorder. Product came and I specifily said with plug what I got was hair dryer with no plug which my husband had to put a plug on and it still is not very warm when it dries... Not too happy... I've had one of these before for about 8 years and it was wonderful... this one not too impressive...
4,Space Saver,Works well. Easy to install and helps declutter the countertop. Would definitely purchase again.
1,Needs to be hard wired!,very difficult to install. There are other models that have a plug in and much simpler that look exactly like this one.
1,Review this specific product throughly!,"My current Andis wall mounted hair dryer stopped working and I wanted to order another since I do like the product. Unfortunately, when I ordered this product the description did not indicate it needed to be ""hardwired"" rather than just plugged into the electrical outlet. I had to return the product and that cost me money in non-refunded shipping costs!"
2,May I Expected Too Much.,I don't find this to be that distasteful but I don't think it works as well as apple cider vinegar. Will keep trying it but don't thinkI would ever purchase it again.
4,"Very good, but I wish it were a little shorter","POSITIVES: Absorbs sweat very well. Comfortable. Easy to tie, doesn't come untied while you're wearing it, but it is also easy to untie (even if you used a square knot) after wearing it. Color doesn't fade. Basically, it's a great sweatband.NEGATIVE: It's few inches too long if you tie it with a square knot, as it will leave two ""tails"" of about eight inches hanging like a ponytail. The length is about right if you tie a bow in back, which seems a little...I dunno...flouncy, I guess.NOTE: If you purchase this product through Amazon, make sure the seller doesn't charge you a fortune in shipping costs. I'm not sayin'...I'm just sayin'."
4,"Good tie band, just wish it was wider.","I like this tie band, it keeps sweat out of my eyes but I have pretty long hair and this is where this product doesn't handle very well. If it was a bit wider it could help trap more hair and keep it from coming loose and into my face. Using this in combination with a bandanna works well but would have liked a ""one-stop"" / ""be-all"" product. Anyways, good product just keep in mind that long hair will escape this tie band."
1,If I was the Bissell company I'd be embarrassed,50 bucks is alot of money to pay for a companies garbage. Then to have to pay my own garbage company to take it away. What a rip off. The first time I used the machine the power brush didn't work so I used the regular brush. It leaked and didn't have much suction and left the carpet really damp. The second time I tried to use it the sprayer won't spray the carpet solution and the heater wouldn't come on. So its garbage because its out of the 90 warranty. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. If I was the company I would be embarrassed to even offer a product like this.
3,"Great for cleaning ""accidents""","Our new puppy provided a dozen reasons to have this appliance. Fortunately, now he is house trained. The built-in sprayer is ineffective, but normally we use a measuring cup with Rug Doctor mixed into hot water to treat the spots, and use the Greenie to suck up the muck. It is a bit noisy, but aren't they all?"
1,Piece of cr*p,Waste of money. Spray nozzle clogs up over time. Hated to throw it out only because it took up so much space in the garbage can.
4,Works well for spot cleaning,"I first bought a reconditioned unit, and just like everyone else, had SERIOUS issues with leaking. It leaked all over the place, ruined a wood desk (before we realized how badly it leaked), and didn't suction too well. I was about to write it off completely as a piece of junk, but returned it, and got a brand new one (didn't buy it through Amazon). Boy, were we surprised to see the difference! I've bought a lot of reconditioned items and never had a problem before. The new one not only didn't leak, but was significantly better at the suction power. It still takes a little elbow grease to get tough stains out (I recommend scrubbing first with some carpet cleaner), but works well if you don't want to call in a pro to do the whole house."
1,Biggest Piece of Junk,"FedEx delivered this to me this afternoon. Didn't look like there were any problems or anything to even suggest it was reconditioned, other than a sticker on the back of the users guide. Granted I only paid $40 for this reconditioned Little Green Machine, to me it is a $40 paperweight. The suction was so bad I could barely feel it on my hand. I couldn't get any solution to dispense (come to find out the hand unit the machine comes with doesn't even allow you to dispense solution) from the turbo brush...maybe a few drops at the very most. I got more solution dispensed by attaching the solution bucket to and from the unit. I know reconditioned units, regardless of what you buy, aren't always the best thing, but I figured I'd try it out. Of anything I have ever purchased from Amazon, this is the FIRST thing to be returned. Going to drop it off tomorrow with UPS to return it."
2,Wasted Money,We bought a reconditioned Bissell Little Green Portable Deep Cleaner and out of the box on first use it leaks badly. But it did clean well. Just don't buy reconditioned.
1,Lots of reconditioned units available,"I'm now on my third one in less than a year. They've worked for a month or so (infrequently used for cat hairball cleanup), but then you find the puddle under it. I'm not even going to use the warranty on this one. I'm tossing it and trying the Hoover Steamvac Jr. On a positive note, the Bissell pet formula solutions really do work - its too bad this machine is a piece of trash."
2,Worked Well - Briefly,"Did a good job for about six months, then the spray function in the handle stopped working. Suction is still ok, but I have to apply the cleaning fluid separately, which is a pain. Not recommended."
5,excellent compilation - a great introduction to balkan beats,This is a great party cd with music that you might not heard before but that it makes you want to dance.
4,Alright,It does what its supposed to. A little bigger than most stick holders but it gets the job done.
1,kind of small for a Frisbee,"The truth is, this ""music"" is dreadfully lame. In fact, let me venture to the point of saying that nearly ALL RAP is lame. I don't see how it gets popular, because like everyone I know can't stand it. This song is in no way good, nor is any other song I have heard so far from Kanye.Only buy this if you want a Frisbee, because otherwise the disc is worthless."
1,damaged,"Sadly, I cannot review this item because I never received it. I received a message saying it had been damaged during mailing amd sent back. Another one was not sent."
5,dsp book,"quick processing and fast shipment.However, this book has NO answers in the back...which is crucial. Keep this in mind."
1,It's worth no more than 20 dollars,"This is one of the worst books I have ever come across. DSP is not an easy subject, and this book tries to explain it with abudant words and very few examples. You can not even try on your own and check your results, because this book does not have solved roblems like most books do. It's your choice, but you will be wasting your time and Money if you buy it."
4,The Return of Mr. Pookie!,"Mr. Pookie is back finally with all original material with this 2005 album.The material is pretty solid, with great lyrics and good beats. High points include: ""Feel Like I Feel,"" ""Young Man,"" ""Meaning of Crook,"" and ""Payback (Rippla's Theme)"" - esp. ""Meaning of Crook.""With the exception of ""Times Get Rough"" there are very few low points on this album, and a lot of pretty good tracks, but the problem is that it seems Mr. Pookie is no longer developing. The beats and lyrics are similar to what he has always rapped about, and offers nothing new overall.Still, if one is a Mr. Pookie fan, and wanting to hear new material, then they should get this."
5,Th Best Nuva,"Kopaka Nuva is in my opinion the best Toa Nuva. It is excruciatingly fun, and just looks cool. Even though it is a ton like the original, it is still very fun. Some may not want to get it because its so much like the original, but if your a collector or a nuva fan then I reccomend this item next time you got to a store! It is pretty durable especially for a lego and will only brake if you want try to break it. Being a building toy, it is also very educational. You can use your imagination to make new things and not just what its supposed too. Kopaka Nuvas mask is also harder to knock off then the originals making it fit better to the storyline and at the same time preventing irritating mask falling off during playing! So on a scale of one to ten this is a TEN! Why are you still reading this? Go! Buy it!"
5,Great,"Kopaka Nuva is the elevated form of Kopaka. yes, he does not seem much differet, but here are the facts:Kopaka Nuva's mask is more powerfulHis shield is bigger, allowing better defensehe has a DOUBLE BLADED SWORD.the blades for his sword can come off and attatch to his feet, making ice skates.the only qualm I have is that the shield looks a little too common because it has four traditional Lego Knobs on the front, but I used a matching color ""Hubcap"" piece to cover up the distracting hole. it's a bit educational, but they give you visual directions.Buy now."
5,super cool toy!!!,This toy teaches you to share. It has a bigger shield than the old one. It can ice skate and take the ice skates and use them as cutters. I hope you like this toy. It's awesome.
4,ice king?,to get to the point the huge sheald can only help so much without mad friends and the the skis make it so you cant attack much the mask dosent look as good as the origonal and the armor blends in too much.i havent seen 1 in real life but you can expect these things to happen.
2,Waste of money,"My kid saved his money for this toy. By dinner time, he wished he'd bought Jabba's Palace instead. First, It is not really compatible with any other Legos. The only item that even has the Lego pips on it is the shield. Second, it is a bit complicated to put together. Okay, I suppose the double edged sword that turns into ski's are cool, but that transformation takes time and effort. Finally, what do you do once it's put together? If you want a build it yourself action figure, go ahead, buy this. Buy another bionicle for him to fight with too. But if you are into Legos, your money is better spent elsewhere."
4,Retro Stud muscle movie posters from around the world,"As a collector of every Hercules and Gladiator movie i can find,i was thrilled to find out there were actual posters to go with the movies.This book really delivers the goods with hundreds of posters.this being said the book could have been so much better.there are posters overlapping destroying the total artwork when they didn't have to.ALso on foreign posters he gives the foreign translation in english but not what the movie was know as in America.i'd like to know what movies i am missing.Despite these big flaws it is the best Hercules-gladiator poster book available."
5,Delightful collection!,"Retro Stud is a great collection of color poster art from the era of the Italian peplum/sword and sandal movies. It is a book that will please fans of the genre, artists, and bodybuilders. Printed on quality paper in hardbound format, Retro Stud is a great addition to any coffee table."
4,Exo-Toa - The Power Lies Beneath,"Overall: Exo-Toa, the second Bionicle summer 2002 set. It's a terror to build (took my brother about 1 1/2 hours), but it is really fun to play with.Action: It's left arm consists of two hooks, which form a pretty cool claw. When you push a certain place, the claw-arm bashes forward. The right arm is a blaster-like mechanism, but when you pull a lever it shoots. (It has a rubber padded end so you don't jab out an eye.) The top of the Exo-Toa flips up to allow a Toa head to fit in, as long as you press the button on the front to flip down the front."
4,"Exo-Toa Review, no Flash Photography Please","This is arguably the premier Bionicle set to hit stores this summer and, besides the soon-to-be-realeased Toa Nuva, will be one of the most sought after. According to the instructions it can act on its own or as transport for any of the six Toa figures, none of which come with this set. Some Toa fit better than others. For example, Tahu I think is the best fitting Toa, followed by Lewa and Kopaka, but their shoulder arrangement makes them a little looser in the cockpit. Gali is tough to get it, because the piece on her chest blocks the chest plate on the Exo-Toa from properly securing. Pohatu and Onua are impossible (yes you read correctly, IMPOSSIBLE) to fit into the Exo-Toa WITHOUT modification of the suit or the Toa itself. Overall it is a good product, but it still leaves something to be desired. But for those of you who like to tinker you could find ways to fit those 3 disobedient Toa into the Exo-Toa;)"
3,See review,Batteries are a tight fit in all CR123 flashlights. They might be slightly swollen. Six more words are required before this review can be accepted.
2,Looks can be deceiving!,"I absolutely fell in love with this flatware when I came across it when I was searching for a new set. However, I have become extraordinarily disappointed by the fact that eversince the first time I washed it in my dishwasher, all pieces have been riddled with rust stains and/or spots - tarnished to the point that I can only use a few pieces. So disappointing for such beautifully crafted flatware."
5,love it Brandon andersen,I have all the harrypotter legos and they are wonderful especially this set I like turning the thing so the guys go up and fall over I think this is the best set lego has ever made if you like lego's and you are a potter freak get this it rules the earth
3,Why no light kit?,"I'm going to purchase this ceiling fan by Monte Carlo. The description says ""Additional light kits sold separately."" I wanted to buy a light kit for this model, but there is none listed, and that is disappointing. (Exact light kit measurements might help.)"
5,The MOST valuable resource for small business export!,"I enthusiastically urge all small business owners considering export to purchase this invaluable book. It is a straightforward handbook that intuitively addresses all issues of importance for any business person considering expanding his market. I have spent the past month searching for a single resource that provides concise and helpful coverage of export issues, and can save you the trouble - it is ALL HERE. I believe Professor Foley has done a great service to the small business community in providing this excellent reference."
5,Excellent Resource for International Trade Professionals and Newcomers,"Foley's book, The Global Entrepreneur, is an excellent resource for anyone interested in international trade, and the multi-faceted considerations one must give to the endeavor. It is particularly helpful to those interested in export sales, and marketing, with an insightful view to a variety of approaches a business person can take to the marketplace. The book addresses Self-assesment and Market Research, Business Preparation and Developing Global Partners, Logistics and Finance, and Sustaining Success. Foley successfully demystifies global business, and walks the business person with an interest in global markets from the idea stage through to long-term customer relationship management. This is a great read."
4,Instant Cactus Review,The first order I received 10 of the 30 cactus were not in good shape. I emailed the supplier and he quickly replaced the unhealthy plants in time for my event. The variety of cactus was not like the ones pictured however the supplier upgraded the shipment to larger pots and very healthy plants and I was very happy.
2,More solutions required.,"From the awful text written by Marsden and Tromba, the answer book shows some promise. However, more solutions are required to make it of any real value. Sallas, Hille, and Etgen's Calculus of one and several variables, is one such title that works in the students favour. In the solution manual, every odd numbered question is solved. Furthermore, the ones that are not solved are some form of that ones that are. This makes it a great companion for a student. With vector calculus, however, there seems to be no emphasis on helping the student. Usually, the easy questions are solved and sometimes they are done in obscure ways. If one is absolutely lost, this book may be useful. Otherwise a good study group could probably come up with better solutions.One last point; the study hints are somewhat condescending. There seems to be the assumption that the student has no intelligence. They point out the obvious and clearly there has been no real effort spent in preparing them."
1,Don't waste your money,"This item is extremely cheap and the return process was difficult. If you open the package to inspect the item and cannot put the packaging back to it's original condition; which was impossible, it will not be accepted on return. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your money...........never seen a lampshade as cheaply constructed as this one."
4,No more inky fingers,"Mainly purchased for changing ink tanks on printers, but will come in handy for other messy chores as well."
1,Huge messy pieces,The puzzle pieces are huge and very badly cut (VERY rough edges). Colors are very pale.
2,"If you want to reinforce ""ugly"" thoughts...","""Idiotic."" ""spat."" ""disgust."" ""Smart-aleck."" ""screeching and scolding."" ""jeering."" ""stupid cat, stu-pid cat."" ""foolish feline, fool-ish fe-line.""That's not my review: those are the words in the book. For my money, I never like books where I have to censor the language on the fly as I read it to my child. After all, enough negativity exists in our lives without intentionally bringing more into our home. On top of that, the rhythm of the reading was awkward and otherwise unengaging. I read hundreds of books to my daughter, and this is only the second time I got bored in the middle of a book. This was a once-read in our house."
4,Not much of cardiac surgery,Not much of cardiac surgery but still a nice book to have for residents.
2,I'm So Glad I'm Not The Only One!,"Oh my god, i'm sooo happy i'm not the only one who misses Nck soo much. I agree with whoever rote that ever since Francine Pascal took away Nick the books have been stale. But i have to admit that recently it's beginning to get better. I like Sam and Liz as a couple. All her other staedy boyfriends have been soooo boring. Sam is exciting... not only that but this is the first time he has actually fallen in love- it's sweet! The deff shouldn't break up. About the book... I thought it was soo stupid, I mean why the hell would Francine make them a couple, and then they would problems. It just gets people hopes high. And seriously the should settle down now, the twins have had too many boyfriens already! I would give this book a 5 out of 10"
3,two-face character pulls wool over eyes,"the character of Sam was so incredibly horribly 2-faced that I felt like punching him. HOw can anyone behave the way he does and have Elizabeth's adoration and still genuinely loves her? I can't help but lament over the fact that this chracter's developement went way off target. Overall, the story still has its reading value."
4,"Unsettling Ending, but a book worth reading","As some stated,this book didn't really deserve to be a thriller/super edition until it got to the end scene. The plot was played out in an acceptable manner,but it still needed a little work. As for the ending,Elizabeth going off to London is really just random. What would the story be like then when Liz doesn't talk to Jess anymore? And what would Liz do when she gets to London anyway? As for the comments on Nick and Isabella coming back,it would make a great story. Like another reviewer said,""It's too soon."" All in all,I give this book 4 stars for an overall tally."
3,Could Have Been Better,"In my opinion this book didn't get exciting until near the end. As the other reviwers mentioned, I would like to see Jessica and Nick back together, they were the perfect couple, and Nick really understood Jessica. I would also like to see Elizabeth and Tom back together, they were aboustly great together, and I can't believe that the author wrote him out of the series. Bring back Tom Watts. I hate to say this but the University series is getting to the point where the same old storylines keep repeating themselves, and there hardly seems to be any excitment or interesting storylines for the characters. What Jessica does in this book wasn't right, and Sam was acting like a pig. I have a suggestion though for future series in the University books, since Elizabeth is good at everything, why not have her struggle with a class for a change, or another character? Also I would like to see more realistic college storylines."
3,Not the Best,"First of all this book doesn't get exciting until near the end of the book. I can't believe that the author paired Elizabeth and Sam up in the first place. I think that Elizabeth and Tom were the best couple, and that they should get back together. Also in this book, Elizabeth mostly acts very needy and it is very annoying, what happened to the Elizabeth that was independent, and didn't depend on a guy? Jessica starts to act in some ways like her old self again in this book. I hope that Junior year of this series will be more exciting, and less with the hysterics."
2,could have done better,"Francine Pascal did such a great job on the first 40 or so books, but after she made it clear that Elizabeth and Tom were over that is when she messed up. I enjoyed reading about Elizabeth and Tom's relationship because it related to my own. I don't like many of the new characters that Ms. Pascal has introduced. I belive if something isn't broken than why fix it? Although I still enjoy her books and think that they are a realistic to a point, the main point is that: she messed up when she broke up Tom and Elizabeth. End of discussion."
1,Let Elizabeth stay in London,"Please, let Elizabeth stay in London. Perhaps while she is there she can solve the problem of foot and mouth disease, since she is such a natural at everything. Kidding aside, we know that she and Jessica will talk again. There would be no more books if they didn't, and isn't this the bazillionth time the twins have stormed apart and said they'd never speak to each other again? Besides, the guys they fight over have all the charm of baked squash. If Sam really cared about Elizabeth so much he wouldn't have thought of flirting with Jessica. And Elizabeth was pretty stupid to even bring Jessica along, knowing of her sister's track record for stealing boyfriends."
5,A Great Book!,"I found myself getting absorbed into this book about Chile peppers. Now I know so much more about them. This book came with a textbook set, Into English, for ESOL students. I highly recommend it when learning about different cultures and important foods. Personally, I love Chile Peppers!"
5,Great Dryer,"Compact yet powerful,Chord could be a bit longer but still a great product.Footprint is small and easy to install on wall.No on-off switch- automatically starts or stops when removed or reinserted into mounting slot"
4,Great hair product,My old Andis wall mount finally died after over 20 yrs! It came with the house when we moved in and was always used several times a week. This one is every bit as good except for one item. It does not have an on-off switch. This requires that you must hang it up to turn it off. A bit of an inconvenience. I really wish they'd kept the old design. This one is great for doing it's job and was easy to install. It used exactly the same footprint as my prior one. Still a keeper
3,Not perfect,"The drying power is very good. Size is perfect, not big and bulky on the wall. The draw backs are you cannot turn off the power without putting the dryer back in the cradle. Also, the clip tha hold the dryer in place is plastic, and is also the power switch. I don't think the plastic would hold up well unless it is handled with care."
2,Does not hold up well to everyday use,"I purchased 3 of these units for the bathrooms in my bed and breakfast. The dryer is held in place at the top by a lever, which you release to remove the dryer from the wall unit (and which also turns the dryer on), and by a plastic ""lip"" at the bottom of the wall unit that the handle fits into. The plastic ""lip"" on two of the wall units broke within days so and the dryers can no longer hang from the wall unit. I called Andis and was told that there was nothing they could do. It's a good concept, and the dryers work well (although they are LOUD), but the plastic wall unit just does not hold up."
5,Further insights as to what each step is all about,Fabulous book which gives factual and specific thoughts on what is in each step and how long term sobriety can be enhanced by reading and utilizing some of the suggestions mentioned. Great working tool for someone interested in learning what steps mean in day-to-day sober living.
2,where's the romance,"this book contains three short stories from different writers. each story is about how a cat helps a couple find and keep true love. the stories are very cute, but not really interesting to me. they seemed to be geared to younger readers. it is supposed to be a romance book, but there is little to no romance in it. yes of course, the people fall in love, but that's it. there is absolutely no sexual content in this book. the stories are written by cindy holbrook, nancy lawrence, and hayley ann solomon."
5,Gali,This set is best theme that LEGO has come out with. The Toa Nuva are great and all but in my opionion Gali is the best. The armor makes her look cool and the mask is neat.
2,you get what you pay for,"These tools will work...prvided you know enough about sharpening to give them a new edge. Smaller gouges, however, are ground incorrectly. Need to reshape the whole thing. Steel isn't bad, but it's light-duty. It does seem to hold an edge once you get it ground correctly - it's just a little lightweight. I suppose it's not a bad set for the beginning woodturner. That being said, the beginning woodturner usually doesn't have a lot of experience with sharpening tools. I think I'll look to start replacing them pronto."
3,It's just OK,"I received the VibraSpa as a Christmas gift. It works ok. The vibration was mediocre and the infrared heat was barely heat at all. I would have been much happier with the bubble spa. I would recommend putting in very warm water because once the water hits unit, the water temp drops dramatically."
2,"Ehh, Better than nothing","I got this because I am on my feet all day long. The good points... its well built. The bad points...the Vibrating massage is not strong enough for any real help ,the acupressure roller is at a odd place making you put your foot at a weird angel that hurts more than helps, and the infrared heat is more like a red light than any real help. You are better off soaking in a nice hot bath tub."
2,Stop - read this before you buy this accessory,"Stop- This item is a replacement for the quick release bike mounting kit. It does NOT include the new wrist band for the watch. If you want full quick release capabilities you need to buy the KIT, not the replacement bracket. Spend the extra $10,,,it's worth it"
1,Save Your Money,"Save your money. Purchase a section of pipe insulation from your local hardware store. Better yet, go to a home construction site and ask for a scrap piece. Cut about an inch and half section of the insulation. Then cut the section length wise so it opens up. Place it on your bike handlebars and wrap your Garmin w/wrist band around it."
3,Good but there is a catch,"Works well for what it is however, there is a catch... You have to take the band off the watch to clip it in. Like another reviewer stated (wish I would have listed) its actually easier to find a big piece of foam to cut to size and wrap around your handlebar. This is what I ended up doing and its working great."
4,I like it but,Great item. Esy to mount but would be better if there was a clamp system to remove it without cutting the zip ties. Still very good for the price.
3,Slick but not durable.,"I've had two of them fail in the same location on the front of the mount, but Garmin refuses to admit there is any kind of issue and won't provide any warranty replacements. It still is the slickest way to mount for a quick release from the bike even though strapping the wrist strap around a piece of pipe insulation or buying Garmin's adapter for this purpose may be more robust in the long run. If you buy one, make sure you keep an eye on the narrow sections in the front for cracks as they will fail eventually and you won't be happy if you lose your forerunner in the process."
4,a must have for any cyclists using the Garmin,"I rate items based on three criteria - Does it work as advertised? Does the value justify the cost? Does it improve my life. I put my recommendation at the top, then answer those three questions below.RECOMMENDATIONThis is a must have for any cyclists using the Garmin for their computer.FUNCTIONALITYThe velcro replacement wristband is actually an improvement over the wristband the Garmin unit actually ships with. I love it.VALUENo question. Buy it! It's all plastic and feels a little cheap, but the price still makes it a bargain.DOES IT IMPROVE MY LIFE?Yep. Faster/easier transition during races, and better overall wristband for the 305."
4,Interesting and well documented,"Serious book, with a lot of informations (and maps). I only dislike the poor quality of the photographic reproductions (too much contrast and too small)."
5,A bit technical but a fantastic book for Tiger fanatics.,"As with both books in this series, this one is a little heavy on the technical aspects of the Jagdtiger, but it has all the photos and data one could ever hope for on this battle field monster. HIGHLY recommend this one if you are an advanced fanatic of German armor, well worth the price."
2,A must for Jagdtiger enthusiasts,Full of excellent photographs and day by day coverage of the Jagdtigers in operation throughout WW II.
1,A Lemon,"I was thrilled when I found this item at Amazon.com becasue I had always wanted a hair dryer to mount on the wall. I decided to use it before I had it mounted to check it out. After 5 minutes it just stoped working. I packed it up and sent it back. I would not judge every dryer made by this company by this one, I may have just got a hold of a lemon."
4,Good on wall hair dryer.,"Easy to install on wall but requires some drilling. Three heat settings work well but I would like to have a setting that is ""air only"" like my old dryer had. Night light is green but throws enough light to see way around bathroom at night. No way to turn night light off."
3,Caution / Fire Hazard,"I have had a several Andis wall mount hair dryers and never had a problem. However, my last purchase was the model with the built-in night light. The night light is green and stays on all the time. I thought this was pretty nice. HOWEVER, THIS MODEL IS A FIRE HAZARD!!! After several days being plugged in, my husband and I returned home to find the a terrible burning smell in the bathroom. We immediately unplugged the unit. When my husband opened the hairdryer,the parts connected to the nightlight were all burned and charred. He was able to disconnect that portion and the unit is fine now. I cannot think of what we would have found had if we were away for a longer period of time. I think this would have definitely caused a fire. Andis makes a good hairdryer -- JUST NOT THIS MODEL."
4,A great product,"This is a very good product. I have been using over a month. It has enough power to blow your hair faster. However, the night light caused everyone a little uncomfortable. The light was too bright when I pluged the power. The only way to turn off light is to press Test buttom and press Reset buttom when you needed to use, which is very inconvenience. So, I opened the back cover and stick the dark tape on the light screen to reduce the bright light. I wish there is a dimm switch to adjust light."
1,Second One Too! Burnout Both Times,"This week, our second Andis wall mounted dryer burned out. After our first failure, I always checked and cleaned it out on a regular basis. Prior to complete unit failure, the internal thermal protection would turn the unit off prior to my wife finishing her hair. It would typically work again the next day. The first one lasted about 3 month, the second one about 8 months. I have another model from a different manufacturer in my bath and it has worked for over 10 years. We purchased this one because of the claim to produce less noise (not really) and the night light. The night light could be too bright for some, but it was OK for us. I just order another wall mount from a different manufacturer. In less than 1 year, I will be $120+ for one hair dryer. Not good value. Plus, I am sure I'll have to make new mounting holes and, patch and repaint over the old ones."
3,"Ok, but for a few cents more it could have been better....","The night light is very powerful, which is good. The bad thing is, there is no way to toggle the light without unplugging it. I mean, they could have easily added a light/dark sensor so that it would cycle on and off as needed. It does have nice UMPH as a dryer, but again, it could have been better."
3,TOO LOUD!,"I like the wall mount; the green oval nightlight is useful but silly during the day; it blows cool-ish air and in my opinion - it's very loud. Not good for someth that's right near your ear. Too bad, otherwise as expected."
4,Andia 33700 Hangup Pro Turbo Hair Dryer,"Love the hair dryer but wish I would have gotten one without the ""night light"". The night light is more like a beacon. VERY bright and VERY green. Not a soft glow like you would expect a night light to be. I ended up placing paper over the light to tone it down since there seems no way to turn it off or disable it.Very satisfied with the actual dryer and love that it hangs on the wall and is not in the way like most dryers."
1,Goober,"I was stunned also when I received this package.The screen shot is shown with the whole Slytherin Castle but I received set 4735 only to realize that to build all of the castle you would need 17 sets of Lego's. Let's see, at $110 per set that adds up to $1,870. OMG!!! This is a child's building set. Needless to say, this will be returned."
3,Another book.,"I didn't find this book very useful, I recommend saving your money for some of the more recently written books on piano playing, such as the wonderful book by Gyorgy Sandor (On Piano Playing: Motion, Sound, and Expression), or the one by Seymour Fink (Mastering Piano Technique: A Guide for Students, Teachers, and Performers). Those are much more helpful in detailed technical and artistic suggestions.Actually, those others are so much better you must have a copy if you are serious about the piano."
2,Probably Not a Complete Waste,"The author wrote this with the underlying belief that not every way of hitting a piano key will produce the same sound. I can't subscribe to that, because at the end of the chain of events that produces a note, the sound is caused by a hammer hitting the string(s). Whether you hit that key with ""the fleshy part of your finger"", your fist or a waffle iron, it's still just hammers striking strings.When the author isn't going on and on about the theatrics of your wrist and arm motion to better hit a key so as to let him think you're producing a different tone, the rest of this book can actually be of some help to some pianists and wannabes."
5,Wonderful,"Josef Lhevinne has done an oustanding job in BASIC PRINCIPLES IN PIANOFORTE PLAYING. He covers many useful topics such as sight-reading, rhythm, practice, using the pedal, legato, but the majority of this book is devoted to the secret of a beautiful tone.Although this book is very short (the material is supposed to be basic, after all), Lhevinne manages to effectively illustrate everything he presents by applying each principle to excerpts from well-known classical pieces.As a pianist who is trying to improve his technique, I would highly recommend this to anyone who is seeking to do the same."
5,Worth every page,"Perhaps the previous reviewer did not take note of the title - ""Basic Principles in Piano Forte Playing"", which is just what it is - nothing more, nothing less. Josef Lehvinne is of the old school of thinking, namely, he believes that only meisters should be teaching how to play music, although he grudgingly acknowledges that demand outstrips supply and American ""method"" teaching has reached acceptable standards. I dread what he would think of me trying to teach myself. I could make fun of his attitude, but in reality he is a perfectionist, and that is what it really takes to make an outstanding musician of any instrument. Furthermore, he shares in a very readable style what is important when mastering the piano. Even a beginner like me can appreciate the value of his very generous advice. Every page has at least one or more important gems, and his style of writing is such that you are sure to remember them!"
5,basic principles of pianoforte playing,This is still the most influential source on the Russian School of Piano Playing. It starts here - all other publications follow it. Still THE best book on piano playing.
5,Simply a Gem,"This book is a real gem. In particular, Mr. Lhevine's understanding of how the beautiful tone - the most difficult task for piano player - can be reached. I have read many books on the subject of piano technique. Many of them are subjective approximations, some contains intuitive insights here and there. In this one I found the answer I was looking for all my life - how to create a singing tone. A wonderful confirmation for my own findings and observations which made me happy. Dover made a rare gift to all those tormented souls who are in constant search of beauty."
3,What an interesting woman!,"I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Sauders and getting a copy of her book. This is an interesting woman who has 'sailed' through many adventures - both on and off the water. She speaks of many of the 'hidden' stories of what happens on cruise ships. The book is written with warm honesty, a quick wit and a great sense of humor."
3,Doesn't age well,I read this when it first came out and loved it but it doesn't age well.The back stories are interesting but this time around her ego overcomes her stories and it becomes a bragfest.This is an updated version perhaps she should have left well enough alone
5,The funniest book I have ever read!,My sister gave me this book and I was reluctant to read it because I thought it was going to be a serious psychological piece about how hypochondriacs are wusses and just plain crazy! I decided to give it a try and every pragraph made me laugh out loud! I am a silent hypochondriac...never go to the doctor unless I need a written physical for work but always diagnose myself by doing research on all possible illnesses that I think I may have. This book really hit home!If laughter is the best medicine then buy this book and heal (at least while your reading it).
4,Great entertainment.,"Warning... this is not for the paranoid, for those that read every bad bio-terrorisim book out there then wonder if they've contracted Ebola, or for those who call emergency when they've stubbed their toe thinking it's fleah eating cancer....Great book full of witty looks at all the medical disasters that can kill ya...It is well written, funny, well organised and lends itself to reading to friends and relatives who enjoy combining a lack of medical background with pure paranoia. Keep a copy around for flu season..."
3,No Help For The Weary!,"I bought this book based on the reviews and even though I expected it to be funny, I was hoping that it would also be helpful--not happening! This book is NOT for anyone who is looking for some answers and insight when you are debilitated with fear over your health! The fact that it was funny and not informative in the least, was so very disappointing. Well, at least my 12 year old enjoyed it. He wants to be a doctor so maybe he learned some good jokes for later years!"
5,This game will require a time committment,"KOEI gets a bad rap in my opinion. Sure they tend to produce button mashers that are a little weak on story or they simply try to repackage concepts over and over, but that can be good at times. Bladestorm doesn't really fit that mold. Set during the Hundred years war, this is a game that is long and takes a little bit to get into. The controls are different and take some getting used to and after awhile you end up either liberating or ransacking the same cities multiple (and I do mean multiple) times. But, once you get into the game it is pretty fun. It involves some strategy, but not in the tradtional ""you move then I move"" sense. Worth the time. Just don't expect to finish it in a week. Maybe not even in a month."
3,The game itself was in good shape but gameplay is only fun for a few hours.,Designing your player is fun but the play control is too straightforward and doesn't change much over time. Worth it to buy cheap if you don't want to be too immersed.
4,"Great game, Lacking in a few areas.","Overall the game is really fun. I have very few complaints about it. The main thing is lack of upgrades for the units you take control of. And the other complaint is when the characters have a monologue, It is really super short and they speed talk through everything. Kinda lame but I guess there are a few ups and downs to every game. The controls are simple once you get used to them, but are a bit different. Everything is has a really easy layout to it, and the tutorials are completely thorough.I would give the game an 8/10"
3,Worth Checking Out,"I'm glad Koei is experimenting with a few different themes and gameplay formulas. Bladestorm is very unique, using a blend of single and squad-based character control, and a sort of hybrid between realtime strategy and arcade action. Although the control scheme takes a while to get used to and the gameplay can be a bit slow and aimless at times, it can be pretty satisfying storming into a castle with dozens of warriors by your side.The main problem is there isn't enough variety in the game. The leveling and power up systems are good but after playing a half dozen battles it feels like there's no real point to the game, and no real incentives for continuing to invest time into it. Online multiplayer would have helped a lot."
3,please stop overrating this game,"I think people have been overrating this game here. This is an average game with very low replay value. The mission objectives are boring. It involves taking over bases over and over again. I have taken enough bases just one hour into game play.Honestly, I've fallen asleep playing this game a couple times. They could've done so much more with the idea of commanding your own troop, but it's way below what I was expecting. Also, it's not worth $50 bucks."
1,"Do yourself a favor, buy a DIFFERENT Solomon Burke disc","The quality of Solomon Burke's voice has never been in question, and Burke's singing is pretty much the only redeeming quality that this recording has. The songs themselves are not necessarily bad, but they are saddled with a produciton that includes nearly every cheesy disco cliche in the book. I suppose it worked at the time, but now it sounds horribly dated and makes for a painful listening experience. If you are new to Solomon Burke, this album will leave you with the wrong impression. Try the early Atlantic recordings or his recent albums. DO NOT miss the chance to see him perform live!! If the other reviewer is right about Burke not making any money off this recording, that would be another great reason to avoid this disc."
4,Study of a band who remained free long past other tribes,"A fascinating study of how land molds people and forges alliances between groups who should be enemies. My sisters and I grew up in the Weiser Valley, never knowing of the existence of this group. When we studied Idaho history, we never learned about this hardy band who walked where our parents settled dozens of years later. The steep, formidable mountains which rise from the Weiser Valley still provide remote shelter to hardy souls who can survive in a non-electronic world. It pleased me to read this story and know that the white settlers in the upper mountains made their own alliances with the Weiser Indians and helped them keep their whereabouts unknown for many years."
5,"Engaging and Delightful--more importantly, empowering","If you have daughters or ever were one yourself, read this book. Ellen Snortland will show you how to awaken your inner warrior. She provides a guide for the journey from passivity to confidence, from being being bullied to alertness, and from being at risk to healthy self-protection. Give yourself permission to walk the path to strength in mind, body, and spirit. Read it for yourself; share it with someone you truly care about."
5,This Book Could Save Your Life,"It may sound dramatic to say that a book can save your life, but that's how I feel about Ellen Snortland's book, Beauty Bites Beast. Chapter by chapter, Snortland teaches women and girls how to defend their bodies and minds by awakening the warrior within. Snortland combines hard-core feminist ideology with hard-core wit. Her biting sense of humor had me rolling through most of the book, which I read cover to cover on my last plane ride.This book should be on every woman and girl's nightstand. Thank you, Ellen, for having the courage and brilliance to write this fabulous book. And for making my gift shopping so easy this year!"
2,Gratingest Generation,Dated material.Terrific if you're a baby boomer looking for a reason to whine. Still a good explanation of the whole situation for someone with no clue.
5,Pohatu rocks! Unlike all your other gundams and zoids,"Pohatu is one of the coolest toa yet! I would know, I'm his biggest fan!You can use him for all sorts of things, for example, in a toa vs. toa nuva kholli match you could use his mask to get him right at the goal.his climbing clawsmmake him even more powerful than the original pohatu, which had only hands. his bellbottom legs make him look coolerand his arms can make a kodan ball for kicking into makuta."
5,this thing is da bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this thing is so cool this thing will make you drop your pants all the way to pluto.Why i'm saying this, it's because the armor makes him look strong,[from my point of view]also the new claws make it more handy for grappling.And the mask makes him look as ferocius as the supreme liger!!!!!!!!!Anyway this thing is da bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Forgotten and Identity, one in the same.","Sorry, not to rain on you're parade or anything, but this score is FAR from Herrmann-esk. I love Alan Silvestri but this is not his best or most entertaining score. If you really want something Herrmann-esk from Silvestri then What Lies Beneath is more like what you are looking for.Sorry but I listened to this score once and never listened to it again. He experimented much like James Horner did on The Forgotten and it come's out sounding too odd. It just doesn't quite work. Both these scores have something in common; they will bore you to death, very mediocre scores. Save you're money on this one, there just isn't that much going on in this score."
5,What I wanted,"It does exactly what I wanted it to do, replaced an older thermostat that had bit the big one. Reasonable product for the price, easy to install."
1,THIS IS NOT A MILLIVOLT THERMOSTAT,it is NOT compatible with millivolt systems per Honeywell. try something else. these words are just to make up the extra I need to reach 20
3,Switched hair correction and a review....,"A reviewer in CT noted that the heads are switched in the photo Amazon/Toys R Us posts of the set. In fact, it is their hair. Harry's hair is switched with Mme Hooch's. Looks really funny, but isn't accurate, so if you were wondering who those characters were, or what Harry was doing in bug glasses, that's your answer. I have the set and agree with another reviewer that LEGO could have done a better job with the Quidditch set. It's like they started to design the full blown set you would expect and then lost interest. It is especially frustrating that the golden snitch has no wings. LEGO needs to come out with a complete Quidditch game set to rival LEGO soccer. Still, it's cool that they got their 2nd year brooms correct..."
3,A set that leaves much to be desired,"I bought this toy several months ago, when I was on my Harry Potter and Lego craze. I found it interesting at first, it had the new bodies and character, Madame Hooch, but with only the 3 rings and 1 seater stand, this set leaves much to be desired. In order to make a complete Quidditch stadium, you would need to purchase several of these sets. In addition, I now no longer play with the toy but use it for spare parts. ..."
5,Great Challenge,"Took 3-4hrs for 3 nights to complete. Great challenge, turned out beautiful, great quality! I will absolutely be purchasing another springbok puzzle"
3,Harder than it looks!,"The quality of Springbok puzzles is excellent--I love the thick pieces that fit so well together. But this puzzle is darker than the picture on the box, so colors don't match up too well between the two. I thought this puzzle would be easy, but it's quite challenging."
4,Greatly organized and an easy learn,"If you have spare time, this language is unique and interesting, and full of culture. Spanish background is incredibly helpful, especially since this book came without an audio cd."
2,Book required during study,"This course is designed for study WITH THE BOOK. I purchased this course in hopes of learning Catalan while driving. It is not intended for this application, and it doesn't work while driving. Without the book, it's a long slew of Catalan, no English, and no repetition. By contrast the Pimsleur system (they don't have a Catalan course that I could find) builds language skills slowly, repeating all words in English, then the other language.In some sense, this is an unfair review. I'm not reviewing the product for it's intended use. So be it."
1,"Holes before you wear them, cheap","About half of the gloves have holes in the before you even put them on, which of course means once you wear them, the holes stretch and pretty much make them useless. If they are not ripped already, they soon will be, definitely not mechanic gloves, way too thin and cheap. Lowest quality latex gloves I have ever used."
1,Don't buy it! No longer supported by Leapfrog,"I bought the mind station in 2007 hoping to help my son with his spelling words. You could use the leapfrog site to create your child's spelling list for the Turbo Twist Spelling Game. Well - Leapfrog stopped supporting this function in January of 2008, so I got less than 4 months use out of this. I am very disappointed with Leapfrog and after years of supporting them have stopped purchasing the Leapfrog products. It should have been simple to include a disk that allowed customers to use their computers to create the lists at home, but I got absolutely NO response when I questioned about this. They sent me disks for the Iquest, which is the one Leapfrog product I DIDN't buy."
4,Royal Pains Season 2,We have enjoyed watching Royal Pains. My wife really likes the show. It's great to be able to get the show on DVD since our Canadian networks stopped showing it.
4,**,I got my iteam by the time it was said to arive and in great condtion. I am very happy with this product.
5,A Big Fan,A big fan of Royal Pains Series - as are my 2 boys - got hooked on it while away on holidays in South CarolinaLooking forward to the new seasonMy son watches it on-line as well
4,TV show review.,If you like this series then I would say look at it. I like the series most of the time but I am not sure about the medical part of the show. I haven't had to do anything shown in the show and don't plan to. That's what 911 is for.
2,Over priced clearance item! $79?! Not even worth $15!,"I bought this one because it's light weight (4.1 oz.). I was looking for a small binoculars for my 4-year-old son. With the original price almost $80, ""It must be good!"" I thought! I paid $15 during Friday Sale. I thought I got bargain until I received it today with huge disappointment. It's hard to focus by adjust each eye, hard to see clear with tiny small lenses. I felt tense after using it for a while, don't even mention my young son will know how to use it! My daughter has a Canon 8x23A, which is in very good quality and easy for kids to use. After doing some search, I found Meade outlet is selling this Meade DCS 7x18 on eBay for $7.95 with free shipping due to this item is a closeout! This binoculars will be good for watching plays, shows, concert, whichever doesn't require focusing too often."
5,American Bison,"THE BUFFALO BOOK is an indepth saga about the American Bison from beginning to end. It treats the subject fairly and puts the proper perspective on the great plains in the 1800's. It is encouraging to note that humans can make a positive difference to our environment, our heritage and nature when there is the will. The Buffalo are back and David Dary has made his contribution. Go on-line for pictures and more stories on the American Bison-Architect of the Praires. Gary Skaar"
4,Text Reference on Begonias,I would give this book top rating if I had had a scientific interest in the history of begonias. I bought it thinking it would have a lot of practical cultivation and propogation tips and it disappointed me in that respect. It's a very thoroughly written and documented botanist's book - not really targeting the home gardener.
5,The Right Stuff,"Mark Tebbitt has written an excellent ""manual"" for those of us who enjoy growing begonias. His remarks about the hundred or so species and cultivars he has concentrated on are very succinct and helpful. His advise to growers spot on.If I had any quibble about the book, it would be that it ...isn't long enough! I wish he could have talked about many more of the hundreds of species in this very varied genus. And again, as many beautiful photographs. I have never understood why begonias are not more popular as, unlike African violets, say, they are so much more varied in form, habit, flowering and size. With begonias, there is something for every hobby grower and gardener--and artist as well, if truth be known.Kit Jeans Mounger"
3,Jumpy & scattered,"This book has a good story to tell, but if you want it divided into chapters that mean something, forget it. This book tells the tales of several reporters, and they are not divided into chapters, but scattered. That could be a fault, but not with me. I liked it. I only give it a 5 because it is not in-depth enough for me. It only covers a few reporters, why not a really big compendium. Sure. GeronL. a reader"
2,"A wrong-headed completion, as most are","Deryck Cooke was the most intelligent of completionists in the Tenth Sym. because he didn't pretend to be Mahler. He added as little of his own ideas as possible, even if his reticence sometimes left very bare orchestral bones in terms of harmony and secondary lines. As for those who followed, Wheeler, Carpenter, and Mazzetti to varying degrees stepped over the line, trying to pose as Mahler impersonators with unacceptable intrusions of their own.The worst is surely Carpenter, which makes this CD a dismal experience--the man has no idea, apparently, how sub-Mahlerian his retouchings actually are. The clogging of counterpoint and filling out of orchestration are cumbersome. This performance is quite forgettable and regrettable, but so are all the sets I've heard that present any other Mahler Tenth except for the Cooke."
3,Doesn't sound quite like Mahler,"For the most part, I do not enjoy the Carpenter version of Mahler's Tenth. To me, it simply does not sound as much like Mahler as do other performing versions such as those by Mazzetti and Cooke.True, it's still quite beautiful and poignant in many places, and the finale is a touching peaceful exit from life. The Mazzetti and Cooke interpretations just sound more like Mahler's voice. This is subjective, of course, but Mahler has been my favorite composer for most of my life, and the Mazzetti version especially sounds like one which Gustav Mahler would applaud.You may indeed enjoy this, but if you have long loved the music of Mahler, first try the Mazzetti version by Leonard Slatkin and the St. Louis Symphony or Simon Rattle's Berlin Philharmonic performance of the Deryck Cooke interpretation.Carpenter went in other directions. It still sounds nice, but it doesn't sound quite like Mahler."
1,Not what I expected!,This is not a typical documentary of Schuberts life. It is a series of disconnected vignettes performed by what appeared to be a high school ballet troupe. The most interesting part of the whole set was reading the back of the DVD box. (a small condensed history of Schubert)I certainly wish someone would do a quality set of documentaries or even docudramas on the lives of the great composers.In my opinion this DVD missed the mark completely. Maybe Amazon could have provided a little better description of this product.
5,MAN!!,"Wow, wht a toy! Not only is it durable, can be transformed(in a sense), it looks amazingly feirce! But you wrecked the pic, big time, Amazon(heh)! It's a great product, and a must-have to any Bionicle collecter!"
5,Bionicle,This is a great toy. I think this is a cool toy. Lewa Nuava has two deadly blades that can let him fly. Body armor and a new proterdimis mask cover him and show that this is not a Toa to mess with!
3,Not Vista Compatible,"The Logos Bible Atlas has been around since 1999, so it is a bit dated. It was an excellent program for its day as it allowed you to zoom in anywhere within the Biblical world to get a close-up view of a geographical area. It contained all sorts of useful tools and a host of smaller maps that took you through the Biblical text. It lasted through Windows 98, Millennium, and XP. Unfortunately, it will NOT work on Windows Vista.Another issue is that, when you zoom in on a geographic area, you will find occasional mistakes. Most of these are not immediately noticeable (the BibleWorks map program puts Assyria southeast of Israel), but some cities can be out of place by as much as 30 or 40 miles.It is a good resource, but don't depend upon it as your only resource and be aware it isn't always exact. And don't buy it if you plan on buying a new computer in the next few years."
1,DON'T BUY-DISSAPOINTED,I took this piece of luggage for my FIRST trip and the leather already has a huge hole in it (after only ONE trip)I have bought other pieces (not even leather)of luggage for a WHOLE lot cheaper and they have held up for several years !!! Very POORLY made and VERY CHEAP quality ! Please take my word on this one. You'll waste your money and you'll be so dissapointed !!!!
3,Good text,"This is the first book on optimal control I've read, so I can't compare it to others. The writing is dry (just like any textbook). But there are a lot of good examples, especially the Matlab examples. There is also the level of mathematical rigor that you'd hope to see in any controls text. One thing I think it lacks is an appendix with a short review of linear systems theory; I have to keep referring back to my linear systems book for important formulas."
3,Adequate.,"The authors do a nice job of deriving the basic equations of optimal control. However, the examples are lacking. Also, they do not present an organized approach to solving optimal control problems."
5,Flying the secret sky,"I'm a little bit biased since my dad is the DVD, but still and all It was well written and very exciting to watch all the Lancs. flying around. I learned stuff maybe my dad didn't even know.Watching this movie brought back all the stories my dad used to tell me as we'd have a few cocktails on Saturday nights."
5,The kind of documentary I like,"I was surprised to find out this was an American made-for-tv documentary. Primarily, cuz the narrator was British (Carlo Rota). And it was about a WWII British project to fly American-built war planes from Canada's coast to the UK -- rather than by ships which were vulnerable to German U-boats.It turns out the the maker of this documentary is the son of one of the American volunteers. And he did his father proud. I found the documentary interesting and informative. The kind of documentary I like -- it tells about a hitherto unknown niche in history. And if it contains planes -- well then, so much the better."
5,Flying the Secret Sky,An extremely interesting and informative DVD. A must for WWII aircraft history buffs. Beautiful footage of vintage WWII aircraft and stories of little known special air operations during the war.
4,Another good set,"My four-year-old eats and breathes the Justice League, so this will be a big hit at Christmas. I'm glad they are starting to produce some of the supporting characters. I realize that these are bundled action figures, so they won't have lots of accesories, but they packed Green Arrow with no bow. It's a pretty crucial piece of equipment for him; I wish they'd thrown it in. That's my only complaint. They look great otherwise."
5,JLU fans will love this 3-pack,"Justice League Unlimited has become one of the most entertaining animated series of recent vintage. Mattel's JLU line has reproduced the characters well, offering 3-packs of featured characters. This set offers two hard-to-find figures (Dr. Fate and Green Arrow), along with Flash. My only complaint is that Green Arrow *should* have come with a bow. Otherwise-- excellent."
4,this is a cool set!,this set is really cool! it comes with ron and harry in muggle clothes and aragog! this set is neat because of the web trap you can spring on ron or harry! have fun!
4,delicious rice crackers,"These crackers are really really good. They look more like melba toasts than a ritz cracker, but are deliciious. I have used them with Tuna and also love them with some oil and salt and/or Cayenne Pepper. Really a great buy!"
3,It is really cool!,I was gonna to look at toysrus and they had it! It is prerty cool both of his arms can go back and forth and his lava blades can go on his feets or both can go on one hand but the bad thing is that there is no golden mask of power for him but if you have a simple Toa you can give its armor to it.In other words its the coolest to go with te Exo-Toa.
5,Still holds up,"When I was a kid, I remember having a lot of the villains and side characters, but I never had any of the Toa. I found some of the old novels at my house and started reading them again. For children's books, they're fairly well written, but I wasn't looking for Hemingway. I resurrected my interest in the franchise and immediately took to the internet in search of some of the older models of Bionicles. I found all of them, fairly reasonably priced, but, as I am not raking in cash at the moment, I decide to just get one. I picked Tahu Nuva because the amount of well priced figures left was a bit too precarious to take the chance that I wouldn't find him at this price again. It still looks great. It's a fun bit of nostalgia, and I'm really glad I got it."
4,TAHU NUVA,"This is a very good Bionicle event, even though this is a very big event it is kind of bad how the Nuva are like the the Toa, okay really like the Toa.I really like how Tahu Nuva puts his blades on his feet as a lava surf board, like all of you, I'm a Bionicle freak.I really like the new masks of the Toa Nuva. I can't wait till Toa Nuva mask packs come out. Tahu Nuva's mask has much more sheilding then his old one.(You can find that out by reading Bionicle:Threat of the Bohrok issue 5) But I think all the Nuva are durable, but some some of the Bioncle type of toys aren't, for example, Boxer if you step on that, CRUNCH!!! I can't belive that they make so much new figures. ..Oh well, at least I enjoy all of them."
5,Great LEGO set!!,"The Toa Nuva are really cool, but if you look closely at them, they are the same as the Toa with different peices. If LEGO came out with six individual sets that came with the armor, weapons, and mask of a certain Toa Nuva, you could just put them on the original Toa and have a Toa Nuva. But that's just an idea. Overall, these are the best of the Bionicle sets."
5,cookie,Its awsome hey im gonna buy it soon! its surf boards cool everywone gots to have trust me its cool Im cool. Ok see ya! by!
4,awsome tahu nuva,"Tahu is soooooo cool!!! And mine BROKE !!!! I had tahu just sitting peacefully on the floor , lava surfing, and then POOF! it BROKE !! Now that is so stupid , because ITS LEG BROKE !!! When will amazon get it ? I NEED KOPAKA AND TAHU NOW !!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Laugh out loud funny,"This is one of the most hilarious books I have ever read bar none.First, Alford provides some incredibly witty accounts of different ""investigations"" he conducts in New York City, such as hiring a clutter consultant, trying to get some fake heirlooms auctioned off at Sotheby's, trying to find a good bed and breakfast in Manhattan, hiring a nude housecleaning service, etc. In between each of these stories are some hilarious lists, such as ""What if Frank Sinatra taught acting at UCLA"" or ""What if unemployed actors worked at banks instead of restaurants"". The whole thing is great.I found myself consistently laughing at some of the things Alford did in his investigations, such as gauging what happened when he asked the nude housecleaners to do things like bleach his tub or wash his windows from the outside. All in all, this is a very satisfying book for any fan of humor."
4,Highly Entertaining!...,"...in my opinion! Essays in the style of David Sedaris. The author takes tests for proficiency in dog grooming, hairstyling, and cement mixing. He invents an odd snack that he attempts to sell at a street fair. Best of all (oh, the best!) he investigates the listings for ""Bed and Breakfast"" operations in the middle of New York City and actually stays the night in several! Quaint country inns are one thing, but the middle of Manhattan? I loved this book and will seek out his other book pronto!"
3,A Jorney of Tomfoolery,"Reading like a collection of Magazine articles, Henry Alford's little book (a comforting 231 pages) is fine chuckle reading. Again and again he casts himself into silly situations and somehow turns normal citizens into fonts of comedy. Alford seems very much like an Andy Rooney for the `90s."
3,Pretty funy,"This is a pretty funny book--a guy who does a lot of crazy adventures and then writes about them. There's one where he took some fake heirlooms (pencil shavings, a bone) to Sotheby's auction house and tried to get a lot of money for them which I really liked."
3,weird new age stuff,"Dossey's Holiday Folklore is interesting, then he digresses into weird New Age ""think it and you can make it happen"" stuff related to his experiences with people with phobias. If you skim those sections of the book, its ok, but I found it distracting."
4,Dr Miriam Stoppard - thanks,"I read this book cover to cover, inside out before my little girl came along. As a first time mum, I needed to feel that I knew somethings before faced with the inevitable. It was my guide. Can't say I'm great at parenting but I'm glad I got this book."
5,Pregnancy Hand Book,"I am a nurse practitioner and recommend this book to all of my pregnant women, especially my first-time moms. It is exceptional for content, art work and easy quick data for a non-medical person to understand and use. It opens the door to pregnancy with knowledge and calmness."
2,"Cute, but not so great","These shoes are very cute. However, they run very narrow. I bought them on sale for @ $11. If they fit you properly that's @ what they are worth. The original price was @ $40, but the quality is not any better than shoes I have gotten from Payless or Wal-Mart. The shoes were way too narrow for me so I gave them away. I also bought them for my daughter. They did fit her, but the gathered elastic back rubbed blisters on her feet. I wouldn't buy them again."
5,Great Purchase,I am very pleased with my purchase. I grew up in the 70's and late 60's. I think the music back then were classics and the music that we have now is awful. It was easy to purchase and it arrived promptly. Thanks Amazon!
3,"An okay book, but not the best","This is a book of the simple descriptive format that is very successful with young children learning to speak.Some of the descriptions are, even for young kids, funny - ears are for holding glasses up, knees are for lots of bandages. Others are more useful - noses are for smelling with, eyes are for seeing.But I find the illustrations a little off (I don't know why, it's nothing I can really explain), and I don't find that it really grabs the attention of my young nieces, nor of other small children I've read it to.I also find the size of the book a little awkward for putting away."
3,Intro 2 Ak,"New to underground hip hop? Love to find new artists? Rather than his full length release 'Balance' [which was a debacle in my opinion]- Ak's EP is a dope introduction to this Mass. born emcee.Highlights: Ruff Enuff, Battle RoyalDecent little EP for all you heads."
4,Overheating: Secret to success,I love the way the Andis dryer looks and the little clock is perfect in my mad dash to get ready for work. I use a hair dryer almost every day and dont want to have to deal with plugging and unplugging or leaving it sitting around cluttering up my bathroom. I had used this type dryer before (in hotels) and found that it was very sensitive to overheating and will shut down for enormous amounts of time - UNLESS - you do one simple thing. If you run your dryer full speed hot (like I do) to dry your hair you MUST blow it out at the lowest heat setting for at least 30 seconds. Otherwise you may have to wait DOUBLE DIGIT MINUTES before the dryer will turn on again for styling. 30 seconds is the differnce between loving and hating this product.
3,75% satisfied,Was satisfied with the dryer but the clock on either of the two I bought does not even come close to keeping time
1,RIP OFF,2nd the motion of previous reviewer. You're SO right. THANKS for the 'heads up'. Check Chris' website BEFORE ordering this item.
5,A sparkling new group excels in Mendelssohn,"I can find little information about the Primavera Chamber Ensemble, but I believe they are a London group founded in 1986. In any event, they are new to me, and so I was amazed by the excellence of this CD, which contains the best Mendelssohn Octet I've ever encountered. What sets this performance apart is that the Primavera sound like a true string ensemble, not a casual gathering of players each trying to stand out. They concentrate on complete unanimity, careful balance, and exact intonaiton.Added to these virtues, they play in the infectious, mercurial spirit of early Mendelssohn--the Octet comes from the fairy world of A Midsummer Night's Dream. By comparsion, other performances that I've heard over the years feel ragged, over-stated, and cumbersome. The filler is Mendelssohn's String Quintet #2, not the masterpiece that the Octet is but a fine work that the Primavera also play very engagingly."
3,Championship Bass,If your interested in a tournament based type fishing game this is pretty good. It has a wide variety of equipment and baits. Fairly easy to pick up on how to play without reading all the information. Once you start playing it can keep you hooked for hours trying to catch the big ones.
5,Easy-To-Use Cloth Diapers!,I used these with my son for a year and a half. They're still in great shape and ready to be passed down to baby #2. I highly recommend these!
1,AH,"I did not like these diapers at all. I tried both the 4-10lb and the 10-22lb and had the same problem. They leaked around the legs and soaked clothing. Both were a great fit and look well made, with lots of velcro for a good fit. they did not leak through the diaper-just around the legs. However, wet is wet.I have used other fitted diapers with a seperate cover and really liked them. I may try this brand again but not he AIOs. I will use a cover."
4,3 yr old old loves it!,My 3 year old grandson loves this DVD. It holds his attention with fast changing pictures of military and civilian aircraft and some spacecraft. My only criticism is that there is no narration explaining the type or use of the aircraft being viewed.
5,"LOVE all ""Lots n Lots of"" products","I got this for my five year old for Christmas, so we haven't actually watched it yet, HOWEVER, we already have the Lots & Lots of Trains Vol I & II and WE LOVE THEM! Well my son does. He watches the documentary-set-to-music-style movie over and over and over, and has begged for the Jets and Planes one. I have no doubt it will be as great as the Trains! They are low budget, and are nothing special, not commercialized, not like watching Discovery Channel or something, but somehow that makes them more interesting. They are more like home made documentaries and honestly I think that is what my son likes about it, makes it seem much more realistic and like they are actually talking to him and he is actually there. Good value for what you get and great for any kid who is an airplane enthusiast."
2,No narration,My son has only watched it once. He was expecting to have narration explaining the type of planes and there functions. The camera work was fine but it was a let down otherwise.
3,Lots and Lots of Jets and Planes,"My 5 and 3 yr old boys were begging me to get this for ages. We did and while the footage is great, there is no talking, so it's not very engaging for children. They don't necessarily even need very kid specific talking, but some explanation of what footage is being shown would add interest."
4,Billy and his teenage angst!!!!!!,"From this to Devils playground, it's amazing how things come full circle, I really enjoyed these songs, some more than others, Cyber punk is probably Billy's worst record, yet there are taste of it here but in a good way. It's raw yet produced if that makes sense, and it is bubblegum and razor sharp back alley kickass punk rock. That being said, Isn't that what Billy Idol was all along, Mister Punk Pop, and there is nothing wrong with that, because Disco, metal, reggae, and punk have seemed to fuse together somewhere down the line. Buy this record if you Like kick ass rock-n-roll, and don't listen to what the critics say about his shallow appeal, He's entertained us for the past thirty years, and Gen X is a great introduction into the world of Billy Idol."
3,A little boring,"Unless you're a hardcore Eiffel 65 fan, pass this item. I would recommend their first album, or Contact. This album is kind of a ""sleeper."" Not many stand-out tracks. I haven't even ripped this disc yet, bcuz I don't have the motivation."
5,"Not as danceable, but still great.","As Contact was a slight change from Europop, Eiffel 65 is probably the most drastic. Though, it's not a negative change. The songs still remain catchy and fun, just don't expect the same sound as their previous albums. My personal favorites are ""Viaggia insieme a me"", ""Figli di Pitagora"", ""Oggi"", and ""Costa Restera (In A Song)"", and the second disc contains the awesome ""Tu credi (The Complete Opera)"". The second disc with English versions of most of the songs is a great thing to have for us English speaking fans.For 28 tracks, this is definetely worth the cash. Just be ready for a changed Eiffel 65.Be on the lookout for their 4th album, releasing soon this year."
4,Eiffel 65,"Eiffel 65 made Italian techno. Listening to this cd, one will never get bored because its fast paced tempo will keep anyone on their feet! Don't worry if the Italian language is not in your vocabulary, this set also comes with the translation of English songs as well."
4,A Novice Baker Find this Book to be Wonderful,"I wanted a book about artisanal baking so that I could learn from the masters, so to speak. Up until now I'd only baked a dozen or so loaves from recipes gleaned from the internet so at first I thought the baking instructions would be too advanced for me. I plunged in, however, starting with the baguettes,and really loved the results. My most recent endeavor was the Focaccia, which was a big hit with my family.The author is very exacting in her measurements and clear with her instructions, which I need. (I'm sure, however, that as I become comfortable with baking and read books by other artisanal bakers, I'll relax a bit and trust my own creative process). This book is a great teacher as it goes through explanations of flours, interviews with bakers about their methods and tools, and descriptions of how doughs should look and feel. The book is a fine guide to bread baking and certainly isn't relegated to mere coffee table status in my house!"
5,The only baking book you need,"I have gone through almost all serious bread baking books that have appeared in print in the last 20 years. Most are useful and instructive, very few are inspiring and quite a few are ridiculously pedantic. Only one book became a trusted companion, consulted frequently and used regularly, Carol Field's Italian Baker. Maggie Glezer's will be the second such book for me. A great combination of excitement, practicality and information plus terrific photography. If you buy only one bread baking book, get this one, and if you are an italophile, get Field as well."
3,Coffee table reading,"Artisan Baking Across America: The Breads, The Bakers, The Best Recipes by Maggie Glezer, is a beautiful book for coffee table reading;it is not however a ""how-to"" book for artisan bread baking. It is chock full of information with all the special vocabulary of bread baking--""poolish"", ""levain"", etc. BUT! It is not a user-friendly book which makes it possible for me to do what I was hoping to do--namely bake these crustly delicasies. So, if you are wanting to read about bread making, this is the book for you. Otherwise, buyer beware."
5,Big and fluffy,"My daughter loves her orca whale she named ""Fluffy"". It is big and soft enough to cuddle with. In fact she's sleeping on it right now. It has kept its shape despite being used as a pillow. It is often involved in adventures with seals and other cold-weather critters. You can't go wrong if you are looking for a big cuddly friend!"
3,Incomplete,"This book covers twenty-one illustrators. Each Illustrator is given a brief bit of information, a few paragraphs of information, sometimes just a snippet and one is given three sentences!Generally a single illustration example is given to each illustrator. One of the illustrators has a picture of himself (probably self-portrait?) and no book illustration. This book has 32 pages. A sampling. This book needs to be padded with more infomation about each illustrator and more examples of illustrations by each artist. Great topic, Excellent book title, pity it lacks content."
1,Disappointing,This book was created for children so I was pretty disappointed. If you are an artist wanting some tips I wouldn't recommend this book.
2,Not what I expected,"The unit is very nice. It is amazingly quiet. But, unfortunately, it just doesn't cut through the dogs hair. Our dog does have kind of thick hair, but I would have expected a model that tauts how powerful it is to be able to trim the dogs hair."
3,a couple of good tracks,"this is the first jazz cd i have ever bought, and i only bought it because of one song i heard from it. it is a nice listen, especially for the price."
2,A useless book if you don't live in the United States,"I am an American living abroad and found this book near impossible to use because of the ingredients called for...fat-free cheese, fat-free salad dressing, Butter Buds, Lite Cool Whip??? I have therefore NEVER used this book. And I don't see what is so impressing anyway. If I really wanted to, I could take my Joy of Cooking and replace all the fatty ingredients to ""fat-free"" and use more spices instead of butter for flavor. Maybe this is a good book for those who are totally clueless about cooking and health, but other than that I wouldn't recommend it. It has been sitting on my shelf for 3 years, collecting dust. I think it's finally time I threw it out and made space for a better cookbook."
4,"If you are crazy about planes,it's for you.","It came in long box-envelope but and it was damaged a little bit,I don't know when it happened.I bought it for my friend who is a pilot,he liked it very much!"
1,Channoine - Worth the Hype?,"This new product line just popped up on ShopNBC and Amazon. They played up their cult following in Europe on ShopNBC (complete with rep with accent) but I have not been able to find 1 review on the web for this product. Given the pricing, I would not buy until someone, somewhere can tell me whether it is worth it. Their own site sounds more like an AVON pitch (be your own boss, blah, blah, blah) so that makes me leery of the truthfullness of their ""luxury"" tag line (with apologies to AVON but they know their market and don't price out of it). Has anyone actually used these products?"
3,There ARE 'five-star-elfquest-books'...,"...This just isn't one of them. Reading 'The Forbidden Grove', I often get the feeling that the story stands still. Oh, there are good parts; Skywise and Cutter getting drunk, is one example. There just aren't enough. The quality of the storyline is uneaven, although all the pictures are great (Bad drawings don't exist in Pini's publications before 'Siege at Blue Mountain'). I don't know why, but there's a picture where Skywise pulls Cutters head under water that I love. A good thing with the book is that I as a reader get a feeling of how good friends Cutter and Skywise really are, something that don't always show in other EQ-books.I like it, but ther're better EQ's further ahead!"
5,Excellant book!!!!@,"This book was great! How much better can you get? I don't think it's possible to acually write a better book! The best chars. are Suntop and Leetah,everyone gooes through a phase when Cutter is their fav. But once you read all the books it seems that Cutter is too good to honor.THank you pinis!!!"
4,High-speed film shows diverse power plays in plant world,"We don't usually think of plants as very active. This film shows how wrong we are, as plants compete with one another, battle to survive in hostile environments, and fight off predators."
2,The worst one,"I am a huge fan of pokemon and love the movies from 1 to 9. The tenth one wasn't too great and the 11th was OK, but this one was awful. It dragged out and had a boring plot."
4,Good Book for Beginners,I have Linspire 5.0 and I wanted to learn more about Linux command line. The book is good if you are using Fedora Core and it was a good start for command line. I enjoyed it but it could be a little more in depth.
2,Hopelessly out of date,"This was a good intro book in 2004, but now it's hopelessly out of date. If you intend to use any of the modern versions of Linux, this book will be of very little help."
3,/me Shrugs.,"I thought, with the reviews of this book, that I would have no problem grasping linux. Well I was wrong. The first half this book doesn't go indepth enough for a beginner. It left me baffled in many parts and had to look up the solutions on my own online and also had to recieve help from friendly people in IRC. Many of the webpages listed by the write are no longer usable or are down. Trying to follow projects without the websites that he specifies is a nightmare for a beginner.The second half of the book I felt was more of a filler and wasnt useful for learning linux. But maybe I feel that way because I didnt expect half the book to be about games and programs that play music.It did get me started and it did leave me with more than my foot in the door."
5,Hours of strategy and fun,"Play both sides of this war. I started with the soviet side and after winning all, (some after many tries) I started with the allies. I found it harder to win with the allies. I recommend that for the price, you won't find more strategy and enjoyment than this game."
1,BE WARE!,I bought The Arsenal pack for 10 bucks. I loved playing the red alert games and i always loved the original. But when i went to install I was disapointed that it would not work on my XP operating system. I thought Xp was pretty compatable with everything but i guess not this game. This is the first time i ever said this. But make sure ur OS (operating system) is below windows 98!
3,Cloth Diapers,The Diapers seemed to be of good quality but I thought there were a dozen in the package instead of only 6. That's my mistake. I would never pay nearly $18 for only 6 diapers.
4,great product,I use these with a diaper cover (no pins). I am using them with a newborn and they are pretty absorbent. They also wash and dry easily. I am satisfied!
1,very stiff,These prefolds are very stiff and hard to use as burp cloths or prefold diapers. The snappi grips for prefold diapers do not attach well to these cloths. They also do not get better with washing and drying. I highly recommend osocozy brand prefolds for burp cloths and prefold diapers.
1,Complete Disappointment,"I put these on our baby registry, but didn't bother to read any reviews on them. (I'm not sure why I thought that was a good idea!)After washing them a few times to prep them, I noticed that they seemed to be getting stiffer and scratchier, not softer like my indian cotton prefolds. Our baby isn't even born yet, but I know I will NOT be using these on him or her.Other reviews mention that they make great burp cloths. I think that's exactly what I'll do. I'll also read more reviews next time before buying a diaper!"
4,Finally found a thickness I like!,"I really love these prefolds. This is my 3rd type of prefold and I'm finally content with the diapers. The two other prefolds that I ordered were thick and bulky and I know that some people love that for absorbency, but I justfound that bulkiness hard to dress. The only other ones I knew were the thin Gerber ones that soak through in the blink of an eye. I finnally found a thickness in these Kushies that was what I was looking for all along. Not too thick to have a bulky bottom, just the right amount of absorbency, and not too thin to soak through immediately. The only thing that is a little frustrating about these is that snappis don't work the best on the fabric. I tend to have to catch the snappi on the seam in order to get a good ""hook"", but I don't mind :)"
2,Not so abosorbent!!!!,I bought these just to compare them to my Bumkins and Bummis prefolds and they turned out to be not as absorbent as either. I used them a couple of times and have just decided to put them in storage. They are also impossible to use with the snappis fastner. Definitely not usable overnight.
3,"Great as a burp cloth, not really for true diapering.","I have to echo the sentiment of others that these are wonderful burp cloths and emergency changing pads, however, they are not thick enough to be used as true cloth diapers instead of disposables. The softness of the cotton makes them ideal for use under baby's head or bottom during changing or feeding time."
1,Disappointed,"Before purchasing these I e-mailed the company about where they are made. They did not reply, so after a little research I found other retailers claiming they are ""made in canada"". When I received them, the package clearly said ""made in PAKISTAN"". I would NEVER knowingly buy anything made in PAKISTAN and I would NEVER use anything like that especially for my baby. I try to buy things only made in USA, but do make exceptions for things made in Canada, Europe, and a couple other places that are trustworthy. Needless to say, these diapers are being returned. I'm not upset with Amazon, they are handling the return very well, but I do think that Amazon should require the disclosure of product origin within the product description!"
2,not great for diapering,"While these may make good burp cloths as others have commented, they are not the best for diapering. They are basically flannel diapers and after just a few washes they have already begun to ""pill"". They also aren't the ideal size as they are very long and need to be folded in the back as compared to other diapers. They are also very thin (but dense). If you're looking for cloth diapers, a better choice would be the traditional Chinese prefolds. I am happy with ones I purchased on Amazon and even happier with others I purchased at www.greenmountaindiapers.com/ Happy cloth diapering!"
2,Kushies pre-fold diapers - not what I expected,"Planning to use cloth diapers vs. disposable, I ordered these pre-fold diapers. I am somewhat disappointed however, as when I follow the instructions to ""fold"" the diaper, it looks really, really small. I'm not sure how long I'll be able to use these and I don't see any size indication that would suggest I could order larger ones. I probably won't be using these for anything other than burp cloths or mop-up towels. Very disappointing."
2,I bought 2 brands & these are NOT the favs!,"I also bought the Gerber diapers - we prefer them to the Kushies. The Kushies are not as soft, even after repeated washings. We use the cloth diapers for everything - burp cloths, under baby's head in the crib, on the activity mat, to catch dribbles...and all of the other usual uses. I'd recommed at least 2 dozen per baby!!"
2,Not very dog friendly...,"The hikes look great, but unfortunately the majority of them are on trails where dogs are not permitted."
5,Restless in suburbia,[...]Just the ticket into the woods or over the mountain if you feel trapped in Silicon Valley. Good details about the trails and tips on where the flowers are blooming.
3,Informative But Lacking,"I wanted to view this documentary as a result of reading author Jason Moss's book, THE LAST VICTIM, which focused mainly on the serial killer, J.W. Gacy. I expected more, but got much less.This is an A&E original documentary which uses the same stale images frame after frame, sometimes boring the viewer with facts that really don't expose much of what made this psychotic KILLER CLOWN tick.I was disappointed I purchased this tape rather than just renting it as I doubt I'd pass it on to others interested in the subject of true crime. There are other more informative and well done documentaries out there than this one."
4,Good Basic Wrestling,"This video has been updated a couple of times. There's 25+ drills as an older version and now there is 35+ drills. The drills present good, solid, basic wrestling technique for take-downs. I presented it to the local high school team for their off-season library."
5,An Outstanding Addition to the Literature on Flower Essences,"Flower Essences are not as well known as they should be.Though there is precious little scientific research to support their use, there is a great deal of practical experience to show that they can be often be very useful complements to other forms of therapy.This is an excellent book on the original Bach Essences. One would have thought that there is little new to be said about them, but there is much in the book that is new and original.Highly recommended."
5,Great read!!,"This book is a wonderful history of how Bach developed each of his 38 flower remedies. It tells where, how, when and why each was made. I highly recommend this book if you want to know more about Bach' flower eseences."
4,well i love that hardcore $hit so if you do go for it....,this comp is nice and fast jus like hardcore should be and with out bein senceless. much better then the first adrenaline reminds me of the old school hard core days... when lenny dee ws all about that gabber $hit
3,"The Title should end with ""In Delaware""","The book is very informative and helpful, and gives the reader a good background on what is required to create a corporation. The weakness of the book is that it focuses on creating a corporation in the State of Delaware. And does not warn the reader of this until they begin reading the book. All the forms and information provided relate to creating a corporation in Delaware. If that is the objective of the reader, then this is a very useful book. If one is planning on creating a corporation in another state then this book may not be very useful."
3,"Terse but useful book, for comparing incorporation states.","This book indeed concentrates on Delaware, but does offer incorporation procedures and fees for every state in the USA (as far as I could see, anyway). It's entirely adequate, if extremely lacking in the sort of explanatory babble that one might desire from such a book.If you want to learn more about incorporation and what it means, look elsewhere. If you want a bare-bones incorporation guide that does cover the ground, is up-to-date and points to a company well-known for pioneering low-cost self-help incorporations, then this is a good book, and your money will have not been spent in vain."
5,Incentive chart,Fast service and great product. Just what I expected. I will shop here again. Thank you for a smooth transaction!
1,Buyer beware: DO NOT buy this one,"Have this optical cable for about a year before it was broken. According to the package, it has lifetime warranty. Sent back to the company and got a rejected mail saying, ""COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS, RETURN TO SENDER"". The company address on the label is:Recoton Accessories, Inc.2950 Lake Emma RoadLake Mary, FL 32746.Made in China"
2,bellybomb,have not had product for a long time. The computer I used it on has long since been gone. As I recall the item worked all right.
2,Worst textbook ever!,Higgeldy Piggeldy is the only way to describe this book that jumps about and fails to entertain a solid timeline or progression through geography or geographers. Don't do this to your students... Reading this was insufferable and ulimately left unfinished. I can't say I gained anything from it :(
1,Great idea poor outcome,"I use the 25 lbs. crayola air dry clay in my class room, it is great to work with and mold, however when it dries it falls apart. My students create AMAZING pieces of art work, and when they touch them or try to paint them, they crumble or break. I WILL NOT be buying any more of this product."
1,very dissatisfied,the package arrived quickly. 4 separate plastic bag (not sealed). Therefore the clay are dried and can not be used. Had high hopes. too bad.
5,Good Buy,"I purchased this set of CDs to replace the ones that were stolen. Bill Monroe, the Father of Bluegrass music, will always be one of my favorite singers/instrumentalist of bluegrass and gospel. Having listened to his singing at the Grand Old Opry, on an old Victrola radio, during the 40s then watching him perform on TV has been very satisfying to me. This CD is definitely a good buy if you like Bluegrass music."
5,Father Of Bluegrass,"This is a must have CD. There are 50 songs on this 2 CD set. The recordings are of great quality. It comes with a 23 page booklet with Bill Monroe history, pictures, and info on the songs. This is a very worthy purchase and a must have for every Bluegrass lover."
4,Works like a charm,"This tool makes cleaning shrimp a three step process. Pass the tool under the shell along the back, peel off the shell, and rinse off the vein. A pleasure to use and at least three time faster than what I used to use (bird's beak paring knife)."
5,Great Music and Book!,"My 6 yr old and 4 yr old girls LOVE this CD/book combination. The music is fun, the book is colorful. As an adult, this is the best kids music I've heard. Often times I find myself singing the songs without the kids around."
5,Absolutely loved it!,"Delightful songs and so much fun to listen to. Can't help smiling while driving along listening to this CD. Some of the lyrics just crack me up. Al Yankovic and Kate Winslet's duet, Alison Kraus, and Mark Lanegan just make the songs that much more special."
5,Great CD!,This is a wonderful CD....I think I enjoy it more than my son. Very creative songs and great music. Dog Train title cut is one of my favorites.
3,It's pretty cool.,I really can't give this album a solid 5 out of 5 rating b/c I really havn't listend to the whole album yet. But so far it's pretty cool and I truly mean it. So I sayYEAH!!! Ofcourse my copy of this album is cool b/c I have it on vinyl and you don't! Ha Ha Ha!!!
4,Very good survey of the basic techniques.,"This book proves to be outstanding in introducing a person who is completely unfamiliar with the basics of sausage making. After reading this book one will know everything that one needs to know to confidently procure the right equipment, shop for the right ingrdients, and how to get started. The tips on food hygene were helpful, but the dangers of poisoning related mishandling meat seem overstated, and may spook some people from untaking a tradition that was for centuries carried out before refridgerators and certainly in less clean circumstances than the modern kitchen. All in all, it's a clear simply written introduction to the craft of sausage making and that makes it ultimately a success."
4,Clear and easy to understand,"This book is the first sausage making book that I purchased and for me it was a great purchase. It is simple enough for me to read and understand. I have used it already to produce 8 pounds of Italian sausage made from a wild hog I shot. That sausage was loved by everyone who had an opportunity to taste it. One neighbor promised to bring me the hams of the next hog he shoots this season so I can make more sausage as long as he gets a couple of pounds of the new batch. This book made this possible and so I raise this question; Is this book a complete book for all sausage making? No, in this book I found while it is lacking some what and I will soon buy other books however this book is the Best book I could find to start me out making sausages. I recommend everyone thinking of or wishing to making sausages at home to purchase this book. I am glad we have this book in our home and so are my neighbors."
4,"Solid Introduction, Lots of Recipes",This was my introduction to making sausage. I used the information and recipes in this book to make some darn good sausage. What more can I ask of the book?
3,less,it says 125 but there is only 100 and a lot of them are recipes that most people would never make.
3,Too much information,For the beginner or the average person this book has too much information. There are instructions and recipes for exotic meats and sausages you will never use.
5,THEY HAVE GOOD SAUSAGE RECIPES FOR BEEF ONLY!,"I don't eat pork and so it is best that I make my own beef sausage, not turkey but THE BEEF. I did mix up some of the recipes using the beef and it was very good. This book is reasonably priced and delivered to me what I was looking for..."
3,Not great,"There are way better sausage books out there. The problem is you can't get the best ones on e-readers, so this will have to do."
3,ok,"I got this book to make my own sausages at home without preservatives and less ""parts"" I have not yet made any recipes but have looked over several and it wasnt exactly what I was looking for. I was looking for more recipes that I can cook the same day as making and most of these are not."
1,Old information and VERY few actual sausage recipes,This book has old information that is no longer recommended by food experts. SaltPeter is no longer a substance that should be used and it is included in some of the instructions in this book. There are VERY few actual sausage making recipes. Most of the recipes are for cooking WITH sausage as an ingredient. If I had purchased this book from a local store -- I would return it for a refund.
5,Ideas for cooking,While using a meat grinder I nipped the end of a finger off to the first joint. I didn't want to waste what I had ground up and remembered this book. I made an excellent sausage that we had for breakfast the next day. No one even suspected and all ate with zest. A great way to economize and keep green by helping friends contribute even after they have left us.
2,Hope you have lotsa time on your hands.,"This game has a super thick book full of instuctions and with everything there is to control, build, and change, this game can be overwhelming. It takes forever to learn what each function is and to read the instruction book. This game is a case of a little too much. A friend I work with had played Civilization 2 which is another Sid Meier game that did exceptionaly well, but after he played this game for 2 weeks, he gave up. there was just too much stuff to learn and what certain things did was not clearly described which left alot of guessing. What he and I did learn while playing the game was that the story was good, the graphics are good, and the game was well thought out. But the overwhelming things you had to learn just took it's toll which probably explains the lackluster sales of this game."
3,OK BUT I'VE PLAYED BETTER,"This game I won in a contest. It is alright, although the instruction book is huge. It is alright for this price though. A game much better but a bit like this is Age of the Empires 2. It's great. The game takes up about 50 MB small installation. It does take a while to complete a game though. Unlike games where after an hour you're done. I say it's Alright."
2,Too Bad!,"This game looked really good for the price, but IT DIDNT WORK! I changed my PC but still having problems with TERRAN or whatever that is. Maybe I'll try it again"
1,One of the worst games yet!,"I wish there was a -1 to rate it. This game is the worst game I have ever played in my life! You may think it's not all that bad, but once you actually get into this game, and have lots of units to control, it becomes very boring, and time consuming. You have to watch Every Single unit on the entire screen move its little squares. I have got to give them credit for making the game, but they needed to spend just a little more time on it! To tell you the truth, I wouldn't have even wanted this game if I got it for free based on my experiance."
5,Mind Altering,"In my opinion, Alpha Centauri is the best game ever made. Of course if you've never played a Sid Meir game before it'll take you a while to learn the controls, but it's well worth the effort. A very entertaining game, that has changed or made new life philosophies for me, with all the concepts it introduces and investigates."
3,Alpha Centauri,When I first bought the game I knew nothing about it but the box looked pretty cool. The game is addicting but only while you're playing it. The first night I had it one of my friends started playing it and continued all the way into the night till around 4:00 a.m..You'll probably play for a couple of hours the first time you play but you won't be motivated to play a second time after that. The game is just too complicated the instruction manual is a novel and there are no cool videos.
5,Taken away,"In reading World Watcher, flipping through its pages filled with magic and intrigue my response to this book can only be this... it is more than just that. When I first dove into its pages the magic in the book seemed not only to enchant its characters but this reader who had dared to open its pages. I continued to bathe myself in the reading always looking for new challenges trying to loose myself in the currents of the story. But, in my search I was never disappointed. World Watcher would not let me go and in my lust for its pages I would not put it down. I could not. Not long after the inevitable eventually occurred and I found myself and the end of pages I hoped would not. I can only imagine with this author's talent and creativity what masterpieces she will create in the future."
1,I would give this book 0 stars if that was an option.,I think Clovis Bracey is a pen name for the room full of monkeys that really wrote this book. I only wish 0 stars was an option.
2,Free,"its an EP of mixes of the song Free. its OK. Unless you REALLY dig Blue October, dont waste your money."
1,Not worth it!,"I received this player for free from Dell when I ordered a laptop. When I finally used it, the battery life was really short, the screen is too small & difficult to read, and menu navagation is a pain in the butt. I also had to 'reset' the device often. This player lasted less than three months before it died. I'm glad I didn't fork out any money for it, otherwise I would really be upset. I would never buy this product or recommend it to anyone."
1,Worthless piece of junk!,"Shortly after I purchased it from Dell it began having communication problems with my computer. Sometimes it did not recognize the unit, sometimes you could not load music on to it. Now, it is completly non fuctioning. I tried to load the latest firmware from Dell, but the installer could not find the unit, even when the computer saw it. But regardless of the status, it would not sync with Media Player. I have reset it many times without results. Most recently, it will not shut off. It just shows a diagram of a computer with arrows going tho a musical note. I keep thinking that I will figure out what the problem is, but for now, it just sits in my file cabinet gathering dust. I have a very old Memorex MMP3642 that still works fine. I just upgraded it with 2 Gigs of memory and it fuctions better than the Ditty ever did. This must be the reason Dell got out of the MP3 player business."
1,Buyer Beware,"My husband purchased a Dell DJ Ditty for me for Christmas, and initially all went well. I downloaded from Napster and installed the MusicMatch (included and suggested) - then I bought one for him in March for his birthday. Really began to use the products at this time. You must constantly charge these in your USB drive - then the battery runs down reallyfast!!! Everytime I plugged into Musicmatch or napster I had to re-update the plug-ins and reinstall latest upgrades that sometimes worked and sometimes not. My husband's finally lost it's display and you could only hear the music but not see the songs three days after the 90 day warranty expired. The reason these are so cheap is because you get what you pay for. If you have time to re-install firmware and wait for the two to three second gap while browsing songs...well you get my meaning! Both of ours is now in the trash!"
2,Screen Broke twice,I have had a difficult time getting various computers to recognize it in the USB. Then the screen went out and so they sent me another one. The display stopped working on that one to but by then it had been 90 days so no returns.
1,Defective Product,"My girlfriend got this free with her computer. She loved it when it was working because she only used it for radio, but when I used it for mp3's the interface was pretty annoying. Last week the battery started expanding and the back popped open. The battery no longer holds a charge. Called Dell and they said the warranty was up, sorry. I noticed another reviewer had the same problem, so unless you have a burning desire to get a $20 refund when someone finally brings a class action suit for selling a defective product, don't buy this."
1,Piece of Junk,"I second all the reviews that say not to waste your time. I have had nothing but problems with this and I have had two different units. Even when it was working, which was rare, it was difficult to use. The navigation buttons are next to impossible to use - and I have small fingers - and the power button got stuck all the time. I too experienced monumental problems getting support and got the run around when I wanted to return it. I returned the original only to find it did not work any better and to be informed that the replacement was out of warranty, even though I specifically asked when the replacement was shipped if the warranty period would start over. This got one star only because zero isn't an option."
1,Good until warranty expired...,"I bought the Ditty because it is small and light and I was tired of running with my big Dell Jukebox. It really is a great mp3 player except that it stopped working about a month after the warranty expired. I wouldn't recommend anyone buying it. I never even dropped the thing, and it now fast-forwards the whole time it's on. It doesn't even have the option to fast-forward, so I don't really understand what happened. For $100 I'm pretty mad. Of course, since it broke I've gone back to using my Dell Jukebox (which I've had for about 3 years) and it has broken too. I'm switching to Apple!!"
5,Great Nailer!,"I liked the fact that this nailer will shoot 2"" thru 3 1/2"". I looked at the Porter Cable FR350MAG but it doesn't shoot a 2"" nail. Also on the stanleybostitch website (nail section) it shows the nails that will work with this nailer. Up to 3 1/2"" and .162"" diameter.Features I liked:1) Tool-less push-button depth control.2) 1000 inch lbs of driving power.3) Tool-free, adjustable, die-cast aluminum exhaust deflector.4) 2"" to 3 1/2"" nail range.5) Up to .162"" nail size.6) Nice carrying bag.Fine Homebuilding reviewed several framing nailers and their favorites were the Bostitch N88RH and Max SN890RH.This is a GREAT framing nailer!"
5,Great gun,"Oustanding gun! Light weight and prefectly balanced. Tons of power to counter sink even the biggest nails. Easily sunk 16d ring shanks into treated lumber. The depth of drive is a sinch to adjust, just push the button on the nose piece. My only gripe with this gun is the lack of an eazy clear feature to clear any jams but i havent had a single problem with jams yet. Just remember that this gun shoots round head nails and not clipped head wire welds. I use Duo-Fast full head nails because that is all that is available here in Southeast Texas and they work fine."
4,"Solid, dependable, versatile... a workhorse","I've been using my Bostitch N88RH nailer for the past year on a remodel (after reading reviews here). Toe-nailing is very easy with the sharp barbs, and being able to adjust the depth on the gun is a great feature. It does jam occasionally and sometimes getting the jammed nail out takes a bit of work (why I gave it 4 instead of 5). Most of the time, I've found the issues with jams due to the nails (the plastic coating doesn't always get completely removed so the next nail in line doesn't get into position correctly) and not the gun - per se. I've only used it in single fire mode so I can't comment on the rapid fire action. The gun feels nice in your hand, solid but not heavy. I'm in S.F., so finding nails has not been a problem. Overall, I would definitely recommend this nailer to anyone."
1,Where can you buy the nails?,"I gave the N33 Bostitch framing nailer the lowest rating, because I was unable to find nails to use in it. I received the nailer and was happy to see it met all the specifications I wanted in a framing nailer. When I went to buy nails for it, I found that no one in Pittsburgh had nails. I called Stanley-Bostitch and they gave me a couple of stores to try. No nails there, either. The nailer came from Tool-Crib in Wisconsin. Strangely, the catalog they sent with the nailer, had nails for most other nailers, but none for this model. Sadly, I had to return the nailer to Amazon."
1,Experience,"I selected this unit because it was a somewhat newer model than the PC round head framer.After 4 nails it jammed. Tried adding more air pressure.Shot 4 more nails, jammed again.Cleared jam, then the nailgun shot (2) nails together!Then jammed badly, with (2) nails stuck in the shute.Reqired disassembly to get the jam cleared.(Yes, the correct nails were being used, air pressure 70-90)Anyone interested in buying a nailgun?"

1,Professional with experience,It needs air pressure setting. Also needs coil nail attachment. The stick nail spits plastic at your face when toenailing. (NOT GOOD)
3,[Three-and-a-half stars out of Five] Another good but not great LIVE performance but a great band!,"As much as I love Rick, Bun E. and Robin, theirschtick is getting a bit worn. I never did likethe Beatles, but love Cheap Trick covers. Theygot paid well for this gig and still do showsin 'Vegas on this LP. Being able to do projectslike this WITH AN ORIGANL Beatles Producer iscool and I never get over how great these guyshave been for so long, but even Robin dedicat-ing this to his Dad, and talking about losing hisMum (see also the great song on 97's 'Cheap Trick'LP.), can't quite rescue this from being a wee bitdisappointing. How about a new concert video, withthe stuff from say, 'The Latest' and 'Rockford'?!Come on guys...."
4,Excellent Beatles tribute by Cheap Trick,"This is an excellent concert performed by Cheap Trick, along with a few guest vocalists and a full backing orchestra doing the entire Sergeant Pepper's album, pretty much note-perfect. Special mention needs to go to Tom Petersen's bass-playing which, to me, was perhaps the most impressive part of the whole concert - he really had his work cut out for him doing Paul's bass parts from that album and he did not disappoint! The end song/encore of ""Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End"" was superb, especially Bun E.'s drum solo. One observance: I thought Rick's guitar sound on ""Good Morning Good Morning"" and ""SPLHCB (Reprise)"" was too soft - it didn't have the sting of the original guitars on The Beatles' classic but I think he was simply trying not to duplicate the record. That aside, this was a great concert with Robin in fine voice, and the backing band and full orchestra doing an awesome job. Beatles/Cheap Trick fans need to definitely pick this up!"
3,Great Music-Bad Editing,"I was really looking forward to this since I heard they were performing Pepper live. I love Cheap Trick. The music and performances are really fantastic although I'm sure there was alot of sweetening and overdubbing in the studio post concert. The thing I'm really disappointed about is the team who put the video together. The audio track is just slightly out of sync with the video and for me it's extremely distracting and takes away from the overall presentation. Also, it's really weird, there's hardly anyone in the audience! They're playing in a room full of large round tables like an awards show and when they pan back over the audience, most of the tables are empty! Anyway, it was a cool idea and Cheap Trick were the perfect band to pull this off. Joan Osborne is fantastic and the other artists who I'm not familiar with do a great job as well. If you can overlook the bad audio/video sync thing it's worth the 12 bucks."
4,old wine in new bottles,"Hearing and seeing Sargent Pepper live by Cheap Trick and orchestra is fun as well as heart warming. Robin Zander particularly shines on the vocals to 'She's Leaving Home""."
3,"Fine to help understand China, but otherwise....","I read this on the plane to China. For me the best part was the excellent introduction in the Everyman edition. It helped me understand Chinese history and The Master's place in it, as well as summarize his philosophy and advice for how to run an empire. As for the work itself, it seemed a bit thin to me, but I am sure there are reasons those more expert than me could explain. It can be read very quickly; of course if you want to become an expert (which I didn't), a close read would probably reveal more joy than I found."
2,disappointing,"There is nothing new here if you have already read the Tao and Epictetus. You can argue this came first (I am not sure of the exact time-line between this and the Tao), but the truth is both sources have more of value. This book has a few gems of ideas that are also found in one or both of the other books, buried in a lot of irrelevant stories of people, mostly students, that are not especially interesting or helpful.I would read the Tao if you're looking for eastern philosophy, and Epictetus for the ancient western view, whether you're interested in helpful life guidance or simply the history of philosophy; either or both have more of value in my opinion than the Analects.Tao Te Ching (Everyman's Library)The Discourses of Epictetus - The Handbook - Fragments (Everyman's Library)"
5,Book,I received this book right away. It was in good condition . I really enjoyed the book as did my son who read it for a school class.
5,Finally a Complete Season in one set :0),"I love this set. I'm a big fan of the recent switch to slim cases for most TV dvd sets, and I am especially glad that this time they decided to release ""Greek"" as a complete season, instead of seperate chapters. This is definitely one of my favorite seasons. I'm Team Cappie, so obviously there was that to love about it, but I was also loving the friendship between Cappie and Evan this season. I was never in a sorority, but I still find this show immensely entertaining. I'm sad the current season is to be the last, but at least there are the dvd sets to watch for years to come! :0)"
4,Memphis Belle & P-47 Thurderbolt DVD War WWll,"A lot real action from actual war. Very dry. The truth about war. There is no such thing as a good war. This will never win a award. True stories all put together to sum up part of the War. War is HELL! If you Rambo type movies this is not for you. If you want to see the truth in real life buy this movie. Lot of good action shots. Real Hero's who paid the price for us to have freedom. Freedom is not Free. Ask a Vet. See many planes come back on a wing, and a prayer all shot-up. People never learn. Many people never was told that Japan paid a visit to Long Beach, and San Pedro California. Two Mini subs, and one japan Zero was shot down during the Pearle Harbor attack in California. Big guns blasting the earth moved and lights were seen about 20 miles away. Yes I am a witness to this. I have 6 years of Service. War is Hell ask a disabled Vet. and Thank him. After seeing this movie. You will."
5,Favorite Christmas story!,"I loved this book! The story is so intriguing, and it made me love Christmas even more than I already did. It is the perfect stocking-stuffer: it is both meaningful and affordable! I am going to give copies to my neighbors and relatives this year."
4,Memories,"I got this for my Dad, and he loves it, it takes him back in time, that's what music can do....remembering a simpler time."
5,Absolutely awesome!,"My daddy loved Roger Miller when I was a girl, and so did I. Enjoy him even more now that I'm an adult. Some classics on here you haven't heard in the quite a while, like "" Kansas City Star "", ""Engine Engine #9"". Also the great favorites."
1,worthless,This chip didn't work peroid. I have a 2008 late version of I-mac and this chip wouldn't work at all.
4,Imac Memory 1 GB,"Does what it says it will do. I really can't measure if I had any improved performance by installing the extra memory. I just got my imac and it seem very fast out of the box, but because I want to install CS3 later and thought by having 2 gigs will help boost the performance somewhat."
2,Make sure you get the right one,I ordered this Memory for my Macbook Pro 15 and unfortunately they sent me the Memory for the 17 inch. they are not compatible and they did not want to take the memory back after sending me the wrong one either. Beware when ordering via the internet.
1,"Not a standard CR2 voltage, can damage equipment","I bought this charger and some Juice batteries off eBay thinking they were the standard 3.0 Volt batteries. Mine showed 3.6 Volts, and the charger puts out over 4 volts.Standard CR2 batteries are 3.0 volts so using these can damage your product. These batteries are also only around 400mAh and even generic CR2 rechargeables are around 800mAh. You may want to check out a site called Deal Extreme as they have some much better CR2 rechargeables.After trying out this product, I will warn you not to make the same mistake. It's in my garbage can as I'm typing this."
1,Doesn't work on Inspiron 5100,"Purchased this to replace the original power adaptor for a Dell Inspiron 5100 that has been damaged over the years. Does not work. At startup, I got a BIOS screen saying: ""Fatal Error: The power adaptor attached to your system is not supported. The system will run on battery power only and the battery will not be charged."""
4,Good for automotive work,"These do the job but tear easily in the heavy automotive work I am usually doing. They do save wear and tear on the hands though. You also get more tactile response versus thicker ""mechanics"" gloves. If I put a piece of duct tape over the thumb a pair lasts all the way through a project."
1,Expensive and they rip,"I'm not a fan of these gloves. The arrive in the box all stuck together and when you try to open them, so that you can put you hand in them, they rip! I think out of 100 of them I've ripped like 10 of them just trying to open them up. Also they don't last any longer than any other normal gloves that do not try to sell you on being tough. Don't waste your money and just get the regular gloves."
1,A waste of time and money,"I guess it is my fault for not reading the reviews on this product before I shelled out eleven bucks for it. It might be worth eleven cents but at least it's the only worthless product I have ever bought here at Amazon. It is a complete waste of time and money and I'm only writing this review, my first, to help keep you from wasting yours too."
2,Marginally HD Screensaver,"The only ""Ultimate"" with this item is the hype. The HD is perhaps 720i at best and the scenes are boring even for screensavers, which is all that you have when you buy this. Man, did I ever waste $14! I gave it 2 stars just for the cloudy sky time lapse sequence; that one was actually pleasant.If you want exciting, crisp HD of natural wonders, buy the Planet Earth series or any of the Sunrise Earth offerings in blu ray. Discovery HD does it right - not this amateurish melange of detritus."
2,DON'T OVERPAY FOR THIS ONE,"If you pay more than a few dollars for this one, you won't be happy. Save your money and put it towards a series like Planet Earth or something along that line. Alot of hype for nothing. That's my opinion, probably since I already have the Planet Earth series."
1,waste of money,This was such a waste of my money. There are a few commercials on TV that you could tape and create your own movie. It is just scenes that are not original and very boring and the music is awful.
2,"Not a ""moving"" pictures","I thought it should be a moving picture, but not, just like you standing without any body movement to watch somthing for a long time."
4,LCD/Plasma HD Experience Blu-ray,"I enjoyed the hi def. quality of the 9 different enviroments on this new DVD. I used the fireplace one the other day during a dinner party because it was freezing outside. While in Europe 3 weeks ago on biz my friend had the euro copy of the LCD Africa one and it rocked. That one was more like moving camera shots with amazing scenery and tons of different places. I'll also buy that one. Funny, I really liked the back ground music too..."
5,Amazing book,"Queens usually takes third place to Manhattan and Brooklyn on NYC bookshelfs but this terrific photo collection will go a long way to remedy that. There's an enlightening introduction about the borough and wonderful photos/captions for 27 neighborhoods. My personal favorite is on pp.122-123, a jaw-dropping 1906 view of the strange junction of Jamaica Ave., Myrtle Ave. and Lefferts Blvd. in Richmond Hill. Today, this unique street pattern remains but, alas, the Triangle Hotel, later the Triangle Hofbrau, where the likes of Babe Ruth and Mae West imbibed, recently closed down. I've shown this book to a couple of former Queens people and they were amazed. Don't miss it if you're from Queens or have even a passing interest in urban history. Hopefully, the publisher is correcting a page-order problem in the beginning of the edition I purchased at a museum last summer, but don't let that hold you back. This is a real gem."
3,you get what you pay for,"I was pretty happy with these cables until one day after about 6 months of using the cables I was watching a dvd and noticed the color was messed up--the blue and red were flickering out. I replugged the component cables and it was fine again, but I have a feeling these cables aren't going to last very long."
5,Food storage container,We keep out snacks in this container so that there aren't any bugs sharing our food.
5,Perfect Solution,"We love these!! We bought 2 containers for our cat & dog food, and they have been great so far. It holds a 55lb of Purina dog chow perfectly! We love how these have made our garage look more organized, they are easy to move, and our pets love the freshness of their food.... you could always tell when we were near the bottom of a bag because they weren't as excited to eat. Has made the pets and the owners very happy and we would recommend to anyone wanting fresh pet food and the ability to buy larger bags of food! Will be buying more for family members!"
4,Great at keeping neat,"So far I dont have a complaint about this product, wish the seal was better but otherwise seems to be what I was looking for to help organize me."
4,Good size for 35lb bag of food,"Good size for 35lb bad of food- holds the whole bad easily.Like the wheels and the flip top.The plastic does seem a bit flimsy, so I wonder if it will last a long time but overall, it was just what I was looking for."
5,It is airtight.,I had to get an airtight container because we have a lot of ants. I was using a regular plastic storage container and it was fine until we got the ant infestation. We had to throw out 40lbs of dog food because all the ants got into it. This being airtight the ants have not gotten in and it keeps the dog food fresh. I love it and it works great.
4,Compact - but truly airtight?,This product is a great size for storing the food for a small dog who does not go thru food very fast. I can't really tell if it is airtight because it seems our dog loses interest in the food over time. He is much more interested in eating it when the bag is first opened. Perhaps we need a product with a vacuum pump to pull out the air that makes the food stale. Delivery of the product was quick.
5,USEFUL LARGE BINS ON WHEELS!,"I tell ya, never had a pet but when a friend that has plenty told me about huge pet food containers on wheels as great places to store foods that need to be kept cool (not cold in the fridge) that you want to keep creepy crawling anything from getting at, I was thrilled.They are not as boxy as wooden potato bins.I also just used this one for storing tons of potting soil. Neat Clean Roll to the garden or window sill and back to its spot. Lid keeps it moist.For storing potatoes and onions, leave the lid off or else they'll rot."
2,Not great for cat food,I have 13 cats and they go through a lot of dry cat food. I bought one of these to store it in. The design is all wrong for cats because they jump up on it and it tips over very easily. After the first accident I took the wheels off. After the second accident I realized that because the bottom was narrower than the top it was prone to tipping if it wasn't full. I tried putting weights in the bottom but then it was too hard to scoop all the kibble out. After a few more accidents I gave up. A better design for cats would have a wider base.
3,"Sadly, raccoons figured out how to break-in","We bought this to store food outside for our dogs...which worked great, until raccoons figured out how to knock it over and pry it open - amazing. If you're not using it in the Wild Kingdom like us, it works fine - rain doesn't even get in. However, don't leave it near animals or kids, etc. our toddler easily figured out how to open it and reach her little hands into the dog food.On a positive, it stores an entire 30lb bag of dog food!"
5,Great container,"This container is great for storing dog food, bird seed, etc. The containers are clear and I love being able to see if I am running low on anything. The wheels make it very easy to move them around even when fully loaded with dog food. They appear to be very sturdy(I haven't banged them around though). I have always been happy with Iris products.We have put 30 lb of dog food in and have room to spare so the 36 lb capacity they list is accurate."
4,Dog/Cat food containers,I have two of these for dog food and one for the cat food. They are sturdy and the top stays latched if I happen to drop one or knock it over. Keeps the ants out too.
3,Good Price - Slightly Cheap Construction,This is a good sized food contained and held a large bag of dog food from the store. My one concern with it was that the handle cracked just by light use. I would consider getting it again because of the price but dont expect it to hold up through heavy use.
5,Greatest pet food container of all times !,Looks cool / works great / different size options / Color options / good price. Nothing more to say! Mercedes Benz of pet containers.
4,Good product,"This is much cheaper than a lot of the pet food storage on the market, and works well. It rolls well and closes well and keeps everything tidy. I like the shape - fits better into a corner than the rounded ones and fits well next to another one for the dog food. 4 stars instead of five because the seal is cheap foam instead of rubber, so if you are looking for something that seals completely this is not for you. I have no problem with bugs or mice or anything in my house, so this works perfect for me. The only thing my hubby does not like is that we used to just keep the food in a bag so it never smelled when he fed the dogs because it dispersed in the air constantly. Now he says it smells when he opens it. To me that just shows it is keeping it fresh and I am not bothered by it. I got the 33 and the 69 size. One for cat food and one for dog food."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"I nought it for dog food. Seems to be air tight, wheels are great, perfect size, very durable and I'm actually thinking of getting a second one. This was everything I intended on getting while shopping around, but a way better price. Can't beat it! I recommend."
5,Great Container,This is a perfect container for my cat food. I buy 15 lb bags and it fits in there with room to spare. This is the second container like this I have bought and I highly recommend this brand.
2,Not Pleased,"The container is great, holds well over 40 pounds of dog food. However the picture shows wheels and wheels didn't come with it. My order and my packing slip don't say wheels so I really wasn't suppose to get them but thought I was because of the picture. The wheels are even in the picture that they are asking me to review and its why I ordered it in the first place! So just make sure you are ordering what you really want."
3,Trying for hardwood lump charcoal,"I needed a waterproof container big enough for a bag of hardwood lump charcoal (like Big Green Egg, Wicked Good, etc.). Initial tests on this container look promising. It easily accommodates a whole bag. And when I turned a hose to it, not a drop of moisture made it inside. How well will it hold up over time? I don't know. But for now, it's exactly what I wanted.***** UPDATE ******I'm downgrading my review. Sitting on my deck over time, it developed a thick film of moisture inside. The moisture never leaves. Once this happens, it's essentially a humidor. Not right for outdoor storage of charcoal."
4,PRETTY GOOD AND STURDY,"I HAVE 2 BIG DOGS AND BOUGHT THIS TO STORE THEIR 50LB DOG FOOD IN. KEEPS THEIR FOOD FREE OF BUGS,VERY FRESH.VERY CONVENIENT....I LVE IT,SEE THRU TO KEEP TRACK ALOT EASIER WHEN GETTING LOW."
2,My cats learned how to open it,"My cats will paw at the cupboard till it opens then tip it over and paw at the latch to open it - then gorge themselves on food. Maybe my cats are exceptionally deviant, and I could lock it up better, but it isn't worth the hassle. I am switching to a different container."
3,need to be careful when closing the container,Need to be careful that the cover is seated properly over the top of the bin or bugs will get in. Otherwise its a great container. The 30 quart size closes properly without having to think when you close the top.
5,Great Bin,"I have seven big dogs, and three little ones. I go through dog food like it's nobody's business so I like to buy two large bags of dog food at a time (lasts me about three weeks). With the rate of consumption, freshness is not really a problem (at least, I don't think it is). I've had these rolling foodbins for ages, but Wal Mart doesn't stock them anymore so I went to amazon and got these air tight ones. The bins a little on the short side (my old one was waist high, this one's thigh high) but it holds the food easily, keeps the bugs out and rolls smoothly. All of my old food bins (different brands) have gone out the window because the wheels break off- that's to be expected, but they typically last between 2 to 3 years with moderate use.The Iris container is made very well and I love the latching lid part of it. I have a cat named Monkey who can open just about anything but this container defeats her- so far. The price for the container is very reasonable as well."
5,Perfect Storage,"I ordered two of these bins to hold rice and flour for my kitchen. I ordered these specific bins because they were air (and critter) tight. I didn't want to attract unwanted ""guests"" to my food supplies. I was very happy with the sturdiness and weight of this product. It Appears that it will suit my purpose well and I am totally pleased. I was unsure of the size of the container as it pertains to my storage needs, so in case you want to know, this size bin holds 100 pounds of longrain white rice. I think it will hold about 100 pounds of flour as well, but I have put only 50 in it so far. The wheels are holding up well, contrary to some of the other reviewers experiences with these wheeled bins."
1,"Cheaply made, bad wheels & lid.Will break within months of light use!","The idea is great and I loved it the first two months. But soon, the wheels started coming off and lid came off as well. I tried tightening the wheels but they kept rolling out. A month later, two of the wheels simply broke. Mind you that I didn't roll the container around or put too much weight in the container. The container was stationary except once in a week when I moved it around to mop the area. The lid coming off was the final blow. It now sits in the garage storing trash.Buy it if you don't mind replacing it every 3-4 months, this is cheap stuff that is not built to last."
2,Cheap price cheap quality,"This ""airtight"" container looks good when you first get them, but it doesn't look to last for long periods of time. The plastic is not very sturdy as others have mentioned. Our biggest problem with these containers is that the lid's sealing gasket is only Styrofoam. If the plastic siding starts shifting (from weight pushing against the walls) the ""airtight seal"" will be lost. I think most people would like this container for their use of temporarily storing pet foods. I wouldn't recommend this to people looking for long term food storage."
3,"functionally it works, but","my wife bought this to store dry dog foodthe good: great seal -- there is no dog food smell in our pantry at all. And it's on rollers which is great to move around.the bad: it's 24 inches tall, narrow, and about 18 inches wide. Meaning it will not fit under underneath most standard shelves in a pantry. Definitely does not it under ours. So it does take up some floor space....Before getting one, just make sure it fits where you'd plan to put it. I'd prefer a squatter and fatter version of this (even the 30gal one on rollers would still be too tall for our shelves.)"
1,Arrived broken (twice),Sadly I had this product shipped to me twice and it arrived broken both times. I finally stopped returning and reordering the product. I was extremely disatisfied with this product.
1,Not airtight.,"This container is NOT airtight. I keep it outside and every morning I find slugs inside it, apparently helping themselves to some very expensive dog food. Also, the casters broke. I'm ditching this container for something that really is airtight."
1,Improper dimensions and brittle cheaper plastics,"The specifications state (15 x 17.9 x 22.2 inches). With the wheels, it measures 24.25 in height. Of course it will not slide into my pantry at that height.Now I either place it outside in an unsightly plain-view position or drag it in and out of the pantry. I will bet in a few months that the unit breaks after pushing and pulling since the plastic is sort of brittle. The corners of the wheels are flimsy and not engineered well enough for the added stress of daily maneuvering where the wheels attach to the unit.Seriously, pass this if you are on the bubble of a decision."
3,one problem,"They are great containers if you don't have to worry about animals getting into them. I have bought several of these containers in various sizes for our dry dog & cat food which is stored in the garage. Either they are easy to unlatch or we have super intelligent raccoons in our area. No problem for the raccoons to open the smaller containers. The larger ones they knock to the floor, some containers pop open and if they don't open, these raccoons just drag the whole container outside! Since we have an outside cat that eats in the garage we can't close it at night. Till I find a raccoon proof container we are storing the food in the house! I'm considering the ""vittle vault"" has anyone used them?"
2,45 qt. Iris container,"I purchased this container at one of those wholesale outlet stores and after 6 months the little ""hinge"" that holds the cover on snapped off. I no longer had the receipt so returning it to the store was not an option. I called Iris and was refereed to a woman named Iris (interesting)who stated that they sorry they could not help me ""if it was the cover maybe but they don't have spare containers they are shipped 6 to a carton and she was very sorry that she could not help me."" I think that a company should stand behind their product and said product should last longer than 6 months in my humble opinion. So I would be a bit wary of buying an Iris product and diffidently keep your receipt for awhile."
4,Can't beat it!,"Cannot beat the price and speed of shipping. Holds a full large bag of dogfood, possibly even two! Keeps the food fresh and easily accessible. The price is outstanding, can't find something of this quality anywhere else for this price."
4,Great but wheels fall off.,"Great container and price. My only complaint is 1 wheel always falls off and as time went by the others started getting loose. Little glue fixed it but now I dont have the option of easily removing the wheels. Nice and airtight and keeps the food fresh. Solid thick plastic, I pour in a whole 50lb bag with no issues. Would buy again! Recommend to everyone!"
5,"Great for rice storage, etc.","I bought 3 of these, two for rice storage and one for dog food. I had looked into the more pricey rice dispensers, but many of the reviews indicated poor quality. These do exactly what I need them to do. That is, they keep the bugs out of my rice and the dog food fresh. For about $12 per container, that suits me fine!"
5,Lovin' it!,"Ordered three of these after realizing how much MORE MONEY I spend buying the small bags of cat food and dog food. Went ahead and got a third for birdseed- I just use these to store the food and use a large scoop to fill my smaller ""cereal"" containers inside.Food stays fresh and the price was cheaper here than the pet stores! Excellent purchase!"
5,Glad I bought this,Holds a 23-lb. bag of dry dog food with room to spare. Lid opens & closes easily and stays sealed. Keeps dry food fresh for a long time. Rolls smoothly.
5,It's perfect!,"Just the right size to hold those 40-lbs of dog food, an air tight seal and the convenience of wheels. And then the great price. I'm so glad to have made this purchase."
5,We Love These!,"We now own several of these containers in various sizes and are very impressed with them. Love the wheeled ones--very convenient. The larger ones hold our big bags of dog food, and also our black-oil sunflower seeds for the birds. We use the smaller-sized ones for the mixed birdseed and thistle seed. The containers keep the garage looking nice and make feeding the wildlife and animals very easy and hassle-free. I love how the attached lid clasps and locks so any vermin aren't able to get in. I HATE MICE! This is exactly what I was looking for and I am very happy with this product. Would highly recommend purchasing these if you have ""free"" shipping (know it's not really free as we pay an annual fee for two-day free shipping, but it ""feels"" free :-) The containers seem very well made--better than anything I could find locally in the stores in that price range. A good Amazon deal..."
4,Satisfied,"The container holds up to a 35 lb bag of dog food.I wish I would have bought a bigger container since we often buy 40 lb bags of food.However, the container seals great; the lid secures tightly, and the compact width is great for fitting in tight spaces. The casters make it very easy to move when it is full. It is well-made and overall, I am satisfied."
5,Sturdy and roll easily,I fill this container with around 50 lbs of dog food and treats. It rolls well and doesn't seem to strain under the weight. Glad I bought it.
3,Not Very Sturdy,These aren't as sturdy as I thought they would be. In addition there really isn't any type of handle to lift them up or carry them. It appears by the image that you could do this from the sides of the lid but if you do it unlatches. I do like like way the lids are designed so that you can stack them. I''m not sure they will be worth the price paid but we will see. I'd recommend them for someone that plans to leave them stationary.
4,Great Food Storage Container,"I bought this to store my dogs food in. After reading reviews, I think I remember reading where someone said their 30lb bag of dog food fit perfectly in here....well unfortunately that is not the case. I think a 25lb tops would fit in this container. I buy the 30lb bag of Nutro Large Breed Dog Food and I had already been using it for over a week when I received the container and the food that I had left barely fit in the container. I'm just going to use this one for my cat food which I buy in a 20lb bag and then buy the next size up container for my dogs food because it really is a great container. Lid is tight and the wheels move very well once you have food in it. Definitely recommend but just know that this will be too small for a 30lb bag of food."
5,Great product!,Great product. The lid has a good seals well and the wheels are sturdy. The tub easily holds a 50 pound bag of animal food our flour for bulk baking.
4,solid container,"container is made in a pretty heavy duty plastic, the hinge where the lid connects to the container is pretty weak, but aside from that, the rest is pretty well made. The lid has a strip of rubber/foam along the outside edge where it comes into contact with the lid of the container, which provides an airtight seal.Generally speaking, pretty easy to use and is as described."
5,Very nice,"I ordered the Iris container for my cat food, it not only arrived swiftly but it was undamaged and the perfect size. After two weeks I noticed that not only does it keep the cat food in a neater container, but the quality of the food is better. Softer.It is narrow, this allowed for me to fit it in the broom closet.The plastic strong, unlike some of those cheap storage containers and the gray latch that you see in the picture is easy to release and press back into place."
5,Great Storage,This is a great storage container. The wheels is what makes the diffrence on this product. You are able to move up to 55 pounds with the littlest effort. Highly recommended!
5,Perfect dog food container!,"I wanted a container that would both keep my schnauzer's food fresh, and also help prevent any weevils lurking in his food from getting into our other food. The hinged lid has a decent sized gasket to aid in an airtight closure. His dog food is small kibble (about the size of a pea), and the container easily holds a 17.5lb bag, but I don't think it would hold much more than that."
5,Easy and convenient,Great product. We have 2 Great Danes and storing their food is no easy task. This product holds well over 40 lbs of food and has rolling wheels so that you can easily tuck it under a pantry shelf or cupboard. It's flip top makes access easy.
3,Smaller than advertised,I bought this for cat food because it states that it holds 20# of dry food.I buy cat food in 18# bags and it only holds about 3/4 of the bag. I have to roll up the balance and put it away until I've lowered the level in the container.It has a good seal and keeps the food fresh but they should have said that it holds 14 or 15# and I would have bought a larger size.
3,Good size great with wheels but not strong.,I just got two of these delivered and the lid hinge broke into pieces when I dropped it taking it out of the box. This was just the lid falling 2-3 feet onto a floor and shattering which is not good. The plastic is very brittle and I don't have high hopes for long term durability. I have 4 of the Vittles Vault 40lb and they are much stronger than these but don't have wheels. I requested a replacement for the broken one and hopefully it was just a bad lid and they won't all be so brittle. Only time will tell how these hold up when full of grain but the thin plastic seems like it's just not going to last that long. These seem like they would work great for light items but heavy bulky items may be just too much for the construction of these.Pros:WheelsHeightCons:Thin plasticWorried when full if you hit a bump while pushing it the wheels will break off due to this plastic.No wheel lock to lock wheel when filling.
5,Useful organizational product,"Recently bought this product because I moved and have no closet space near the kitchen and no garage to keep a bag of dogfood out of sight. This container was the solution!!! Very useful, easy to move 40 lbs of food, even on ceramic tile floor!!! And no ugly bag to be seen. Slides very conventiently under our counter!!! So glad I bought it!!! And I just fit an entire 40 lb bag of food into it. Just barely, but it does hold a lot!!"
1,Castors are a weak spot!!!!!,"I bought the 60 qt poured the bag into the container....castor breaks out of the platic. I would not buy this product if concerned with any longevity. 2nd bag of dog food...poured into the container, did not drop into the container. I bought 2, other is still functioning."
5,PERFECT!,"These couldn't be better. Never a single bug in my 25 lb bags of flour. No ants in my sugar, no critters in my rice. And these are sold as pet food containers."
3,Wheels are pointless,"The first one that came actually broke in transit (that should've warned me). Amazon sent a return label and replacement on the double (love Amazon!). When I put my bag of flour (big bag, that's why I needed the thing) the wheels kept popping off. They simply don't work if you have any weight in this container."
3,Overall good quality.,"One wheel broke within two days of purchase, not cool. Other than that its okay. I love the large capacity."
4,Great for our pet storage con,I had bought something similar at Target a while back and that model came with a scoop -- this doesn't and thus my reason for only 4 stars. Otherwise this is great.
5,Convenient Pet Food Container,This was a replacement container and it's great because it locks shut to keep out bugs and mice and having it on wheels makes it very convenient. Would highly recommend this product. Good quality plastic.
5,dog food storage,"this is a great container. large enough for 40lb bag, airtight, casters for easy mobility, locks tight, see thru. LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great!,This product is awesome! It's FDA food safe approved too! I actually use mine for 50 pounds of flour and there's still plenty of room to spare. I'll probably buy more for other food items as well.
5,Very nice container,"Nice transparent container so you can see how much food is still there. Well sealed food container, the ants that were stealing my dogs' food are not able to steal it anymore!"
5,great pet storage,This has been a perfect storage solution for fitting the pet food in my small closet. It rolls easily and holds a large bag of dog food. Quick delivery too!
3,Pet food storage,I purchase this item for pet food storage. Early on 1 of the hinges broke. It does store the food airtight. However I would not purchase the same product again do you to quality.
4,Works well,"Just wish the seal felt tighter. It seems to be airtight, I just would like to hear some type of snap to be sure it is closed. It rolls well and easily hold a full size dog food bag from Costco."
5,Great!,"Nice locking capability. Keep food fresh with a nice seal. I also love that my dog can't (or hasn't yet) figured out how to open it. It's a decent latch. It holds 2 bags of 35lb food for me, but depending on the shape of your kibble, that might not be the case for you. The wheels have held up and the hinges are great. I have zero complaints!"
5,Perfect for storing the whole bag of dog food (which is important for mold and mildew),It's important that you get a storage bin that can store the whole bag of dog food that is also air tight to prevent mold and mildew growth (this is very common in dog food).It should also be stored in a low moisture area out of the sun for the same reason.Remember don't throw away your dog food bag even when you empty it in case there is a pet recall. And clean the storage container at least once per month (I usually do this between dog food bags) and make sure it is 100% dry before storing any food in it.
5,dog food storage problem solved,Our dogs used to always be sniffing around the bag of dog food. We bought this container and now they pass right by it. They know what is there....but leave it alone. Thanks
5,Good dog food container,The container easily holds 40 pounds of dog food. It moves with ease and the lid is air-tight. I have been careful (after reading other reviews) to ease the dog food into the container and have had no problems.
1,NO WHEELS,"Like other customers, I did not receive the wheels with this piece. The container is decent for the price, but you will likely have to deal with Amazon Customer Service to get the complete order."
3,Needs to come in a Bigger size,I bought this to put my dog food in to keep it fresh. It does keep my dogs food fresh but it needs to come in a bigger size.
2,A lot smaller than it looks,"It doesn't hold much - a new 8 lb. bag of cat food takes it to its capacity, with no room for a scoop. Not my best purchase. We'll see how it holds up - it doesn't seem too well made, but I haven't had it long enough to see."
1,airtight container,"The product is good. The service was awful. My FREE SHIPPING took over a MONTH to arrive. One item was broken and that one was replaced and arrived WITHIN A WEEK (GO FIGURE). My next order was placed on Feb. 26 and as of today (March 29) has not arrived, however, I did receive a Billing Statement for the unshipped order."
5,Good for entire smaller bags of dog food,"I use this to store the entire bag and all of the 15lb Orijen dog food I give my dogs. After 2 years of daily use, it still performs like new -- the wheels still roll easily and the lid shuts tightly. Good product at a great price, I definitely recommend it."
5,Great,I bought a big one for my dog food and this little one for the snackers for three dogs. Keeps bugs and mice out of their food and keeps everything fresh.
4,33 Qt. air tight container,"I use this at home for dog food and also at work for Ice melt for all emergency exits. It's great because of the see through container and the sealed lid. Depending on your useage they offer different color lids and different sizes.Thanks IRIS & Amazon,Eric..."
5,Works great,"We bought this to avoid problems with bugs, and keep the dog food more fresh since we live in FL with high humidity. It works well"
5,perfect solution,"This product is affordable, sturdy enough, and the perfect solution to large amounts of dog food that are unavoidable when, like me, you are a crazy dog woman (three). Prior to buying this, I had food in several smaller containers, and they took up counter space. I've now owned it for over a year and it has held up perfectly. The wheels get it out of the way for floor-cleaning, and it holds a 30-lb bag of dog food. I try to lower the bag into the bin rather than drop it in, though."
1,Broken,"Broke after just a couple months of use. We still use it, but the seal on it isn't any good anymore."
5,Storage,"I bake a lot of bread and this is perfect for flours, rice, sugar, and other staples. Hopefully it will also keep summer pests out."
3,Love It,I love these containers. I would have given 5 stars except the only problem is they don't hold up well. The bottom cracked and we treat it very carefully after reading the other reviews. My first one lasted almost a year. I ordered two this time so when one breaks I'll have another one on hand.
4,nice: wheels are optional,"I did not want a wheeled container, but finding no other options this size, I took a chance on this item. Upon its arrival, I was glad to see the wheels are supplied but not already installed."
5,"We don't use these for pet food, but they work great!","We have two, and we actually use them to store white and brown rice. They keep the rice fresh and safe from bugs and mice. We're actually considering ordering some more of them to hold other foods like cereal. Great product!"
3,Not exatly airtight,"It states that it's airtight but in realty it's NOT airtight. More like air resistant. It does restrict the movement of air from inside to otuside but if yo push on the sides it blows the air out of the container adn then sucks it back in when you release. This is not airtight to me at all. Airtight containers will not allow you to push the air out at all. Other than that I like the container and I will use it for my dog's food. The lid does latch very well and it is a good size, 69 quarts, which allows my 35 lb bag, the big size, of dog food to fit."
1,THIS IS A USED BATTERY,"States this in a new battery but IT IS USED! Contacts are worn, dints in the plastic and scratches.AccessoryOneCondition Seller Information Ready to buy?$6.96+ $2.98shippingNew"
5,Great Product for recognizing Student Achievement,this pin looks great and retains it luster. The students love it and appreciate the quality. I purchase these ever academic school year.
2,Could have been better,"Peter O'Toole looked intoxicated throughout the movie, the wardrobe for the cast was very poor, and there were scenes with prostitutes that should not be there. Truly a disappointment and a testimonial on how modern society can destroy a classic novel."
3,"Better than the Errol Flynn Version, but not much","Peter O'Toole's acting is pretty good as the holy man, but his rubber wig is terrible! In one scene, it is a different color than his face, in another, you coan see the seam between it and the rest of his head, and in several scenes, it has wrinkles that have nothing to do with age and more to do with a bad fit. Very distracting!It's hard to cram a whole book into a single film, so I don't mind the plot compression, but adding the deserting soldier that fathers a child by an Indian woman is simply gratuitous. Yes, Kim has an identity problem, and that's quite consistent with the book, but they don't need to add this to the plot to make the point; Kim's reasons for wondering who he is are obvious enough without it."
4,Lots of fun for adults too,I greatly enjoyed having some videos around that edify as well as entertain.The Penguins present good moral lessons for young and old in a wonderfully funny style.
5,Author's Father Writes,"Tears welled up in my eyes when I saw my son's name on the cover. More tears came when I saw the cost of the book.I was so eager to begin reading this book, I accidently tore the cover. A little glue took care of the rip. Onced I started, I couldn't put the book down. My fingers were stuck to the glue.I'm proud of my son and his family for making this journey. I hope this book will encourage parents to enrich the lives of their children in ways other than video games."
1,Dont buy it.,We bought it for my son. We used it about two or three weeks and it got rust!! Its too expensive anyway and its NO so worth it!!
3,Bag is NOT Sturdy,"I purchased this bag for my 5th grader in January, within a week the side clasp holding the shoulder strap broke. My son liked the bag very much, so we improvised and hooked the clip that is shown on the front of the bag, in the loops of the shoulder strap and side of bag. It worked. It is now March and I noticed that the bag is tearing at the clasps that keeps the bag closed."
1,Lack of Support,"No where on the spec or on the box does it say what operating system is required for this camera. It does NOT SUPPORT MACINTOSH at all!I wished I knew that before I bought this camera! I emailed Swann, and this is their response.----Unfortunately the Max-IP-Cam uses ActiveX controls which means it isonly compatible with the latest versions of Internet Explorer (6+).Keep in mind that you'll need a Windows system or ActiveXcompatible browser to connect to the camera.---So be warned!"
3,Not bad,"The camera is OK. The IR does not illuminate as far as I had hoped. I am not thrilled with the web interface as well. If you want to record on a trigger, you have to be logged into the web interface. Other than that, it's a neat toy."
3,Translation,Translation of sentences to english is not by words but by meaning. You have to go to the word translation to get the correct english words for the french words. Otherwise the program is ok.
3,they could've done better,"I've used rough guides before for cities, and they were very good, so I didn't even think to get a different book for Mexico. However, Mexico was just too much for this book. It got me where I needed to go for the most part, but the maps are really small and had mistakes more than several times. Often hotel and restaurant prices are also not labeled correctly. My worst experience with this book was when I got to Mexico City and discovered that there are no street names on the city map. Yeah, that was an interesting trip to find the tourist booth for another map. Basically, this book is okay, but you will have to do a lot more work than you'll want to when you get to Mexico."
2,Following the Gringo trail,"If you are looking to take a 5 star tour of mexico.This book is for you.It concentrates on all the major tourist traps and calls everything else.""not worth stopping for"""
5,Love this book,"This is a great book. I had to read it for nursing school, but I would have enjoyed it regardless."
3,Quick read...thankfully!,"This was a decent book. It was a mandatory read for a course I took but I would not really recommend reading this unless you are already feeling down. It's an insightful look at the journey we undergo when we age but I still prefer to read books like ""To Dance With The White Dog"" over this."
2,Not useful,"Not useful as a phrasebook or a language-learning tool. Stick to Lonely Planet for phrasebooks, and Rosetta Stone & Pimsleur for language learning tools."
1,Useless!,"Why take this book, with it's limited information, poorly organized information and small vocabulary? I bought both this and Lonely Planet's Indonesian guide; I found that the LP guide was more comprehensive, perfectly organized, and terrific. This language guide enables you to just memorize phrases, and the usefullness of those phrases is sickening. In the dictionary, in the appendix, it lists words such as 'intent','sponge' and 'alliegance', but not 'stop', 'bathroom tissue' or 'hungry'. If you are already a good Indonesian speaker, this book might have the slightest bit of relevance, but other than that, it was a collasal waste of money, and a hassel."
2,Not one of the better Barney videos,"As usual the singing and dancing is entertaining, but my daughter loses interest when they visit the people in the neighborhood (baker, hairdresser, etc.) as there is too much talking and too many adults. First half is good. Rewind back to the beginning once they reach the baker."
4,It's a tie,It's a pretty basic red-white-and-blue silk tie. Good quality construction; it feels nice and sturdy and doesn't easily wrinkle.
4,A solid read,"This is a lovely little book about a guy named Steven (semi-autobiographical, apparently). When his father becomes ill, Steven's New York theater career is cut short when he moves back to New Jersey to run his the family diner.Year after year of being the dutiful son (as his father has one health problem after another) eventually take their toll on Steven's self-worth. We see the contrast of Steven's inner sickness and his father's outer illnesses. From his father, Steven eventually learns important lessons about survival, and even happiness, in the face of hardship and loss.One of the better books I've read in a while."
2,Sorrentino serves up a moving memoir with Luncheonette.,"Sorrentino's first book is a funny and moving account of one man's journey through life's unexpected detours. The Luncheonette in question is filled with a memorable and hysterical cast of characters. But even more memorable is Sorrentino's journey from chorus boy to caretaker after his father suffers from a catostrophic illness.With echos of Sedaris and Burroughs,but with a voice all its own, Luncheonette is proof that truth is often stranger (and funnier ) than fiction. It's a great remedy for the winter blahs."
2,Really?,Not very interesting at all. Lots of details about food and boring folks at the counter. What there is about the author often seems just whiny without humor or insightfulness.
2,"A personal memoir, though cliche and boring","While Steven Sorrentino writes a personal memoir of the relationship between his luncheonette and his father (the metaphor repeatedly slaps the reader in the face), the reader is busy waiting for something to ""happen."" The Sorrentino memoir seems more of a posthumous personal documentation of a father-son relationship than a novel for the mass market. Nothing truly happens, and the cliche and stereotypical characters become tedious to read. Can we watch the Soprano's for this form of regionalism? Would have been more effective if the author was not trying to expand the metaphor of the luncheonette to mirror the relationship between father and son. It seems a tiresome stretch; nevertheless, if Sorrentino feels compelled and pleased with a journal-like memory of his father, good for him."
5,Trying to Live My Life Without You - Great but.....,Have only heard 'Trying to Live My Life Without You' and it is great!!! Would love to buy this CD but not for the excessive price as an import.Big Mistake not releasing in the US. Otis Clay is phenomenal and limiting his music to Europe and gouging Americans is truly sad.....after all he is a great American Artist that we love.
5,If you love the film...,"....buy this soundtrack (as opposed to its vastly inferior - both in sound and number of selections - counterpart). It isn't readily available, but if you can hunt it down, it's worth it. Only complaint - the liner notes are in French!"
5,Awesome Gate!,"The Dreambaby Swing Close Gate is great! It doesn't stay open, ever... even if you forget to close it. Why, you may ask? Because it closes on its own. My baby girl gets extremely frustrated because she can't ever figure out the gate. Overall, it serves its purpose and keeps my daughter out of the kitchen. The door to the gate swings both ways, so you never get stuck in an awkward position trying to get in our out."
5,Excellent Gate,"I bought 3 of these gates for our new house & absolutely think they are worth every penny! We have one at the top of the stairs that allows us to let our 18 month old son run around without the fear that he'll fall down the stairs. He has tried, without success, to open the gate, which after lots of tugging and pulling and kicking didn't make it budge a bit. The other two gates we use downstairs to keep the dog out of the playroom and dining room when we're not home. When we are home, I use bungee cords to keep the doors propped open so my son can roam freely from room to room."
5,I love this,"This is the best gate out there if you are looking for something that is safe and easy to use. I put it at the top of our stairs where there is a lot of traffic and it is easy to open, and also closes by itself. You can open it either way, but it is still too hard for my daughter to figure out. I would buy many more of these gates if I had to!"
5,Fabulous product,"So many good things to say about this product. Easy to install, great extensions (3.5"", 7"", 10"", 14"", 17.5"", etc!) to fit any size you are trying to put it, good sturdy quality and an auto-closing gate (so convenient). This product has really worked well for our 1 year old and our 3-1/2 year old doesn't mind it at all. He can't open it but with a bungy cord we can leave it open so he can travel around when we don't need it for the 1 year old. We have other gates that just haven't worked as well as this one does!"
4,good gate for our purpose.,"we bought this gate to put at the top of our steps. Yes, I know you're not supposed to do that, but that is where we need a gate. We didn't screw it into the bannister and we did have to use a 2x4 because the extensions weren't wide enough to fill the space. It was very easy to install, with 2 people, and it works very well. We like it MUCH better than having to take down and put up the gate that we had there before. It's nice to know that it's always there so we won't forget to put it up when our 1 year old is awake. I would recommend this product."
3,"Manual discrepancy, not ideal for 3ft openings","The manual states in big letters:WARNING - Do not use without suction mounts.- yet everyone here and the description states that they are ""optional"" as long as you don't use near stairs. Doesn't say this in the manual, but okay.2nd, a 36"" opening (which has to be a standard!), per the manual, calls for 2 extensions. But if you have any baseboards, this will cut your lower opening to around 35"", making the opening to short for 2 extensions at the bottom. I have it mounted with a single extension but it seems flimsy at the top."
5,"Easy install, easy kid safety","These things took me about 20 minutes to install, and we had to use the (included!!!) extensions. It has worked great to keep my now 2.5 year old (he was 1.5 when we installed) unable to open and walk downstairs or upstairs without a certified adult (or his sister, if she is feeling particularly generous that day). Look great, solid construction. Great product!"
3,Loved and Then...,"Being pregnant, I love the option of not having to step over a gate!! I think the gate works and looks very nice. The one draw back that I just learned, is the bar gap size. It happens to be perfect for my 23 month old daughers legs to get stuck between! Suddenly, I head this very loud scream and her poor little leg was suck just above the knee. I had to pull pretty hard to get it out. I'm hoping she will not attemped this again."
2,Not very secure,"We have a 3 yr old and 11 month old and we bought this gate for the bottom of stairs..although the gate is sturdy and nice looking (in black finish) my 3 yr old can get it open by pushing it, she doesn't even have to use the lever button on top."
4,Does the job,"Gate was easy to install, blends in well with the door to my son's bedroom. Easy to operate, once I got used to pressing on the release button and pulling up on the gate at the same time. I wonder sometimes if the movement of pulling the door up will jar the gate loose over time, but so far so good. Also, unlike another customer's experience, the door does not shut automatically for me. I have to manually unlock and lock the door."
2,Latch is Cheap,"Overall I like this gate, it looks nice and works pretty well, but the latch is made out of pretty cheap plastic. Pieces broke off of the latch in less than a weeks time. Since we have a little baby crawling around on the floor it isn't the safest thing to have small pieces of plastic breaking off and lying around."
4,Fit the need,"This baby gate fit our need. We needed something short enough to fit underneath the railing at the top of the stairs. This was the second gate I tried. My 4 year old can open it easily, my 2 year old will be able to very soon, and the baby is safe upstairs. My only complaint is that the swing shut feature doesn't always latch. With a 4 yr. old going through the gate, he doesn't always check behind him. It can also be a little loud if it slams shut behind you. Otherwise, it is well constructed, easy to install and versatile. The price was the best I have seen on anything with these features."
3,"Decent product, but doesn't open smoothly","I have a 38"" wide opening, and it fit perfectly. Overall I think it is a good product, but the thumb lever is a little cheap feeling and doesn't offer positive grip with one hand opening. One hand opening can be accomplished, but you have to fiddle with the button and lifting up on the gate a little more than I would like. For the price, it should work more smoothly and the thumb button should be better made. Better than most baby gates."
2,Did not work for me,"I had high hopes of this gate working based on the reviews. I was planning on using it on the door opening to my child's nursery as she is crawling a lot now and I want to keep her in her room to play most of the time. I guess my doorway opening are not perfectly aligned or my floors are crooked but I could never get this gate to close. It says all points have to be perfectly aligned so if your doorway or floor is off slightly, this gate will not work. You would never know your door was off until after trying to install it. Compete waste of time, going back."
4,Baby gate for the bottom of the stairs.,"Easy to install, but wished it came with tools. Because of where the gate fit it was hard to tighten the top to the wall due to the hand rail. Other then that this gate is great. I did not fasten the gate to the wall with the screws provided because by the time you tighten the gate, the pressure is so much that it doesn't need the screws. Plus I had a iron bannister on the opposite side. I did not buy the >- shaped tool that fits with the bannister beacuse of the iron was wide enough to not need it. The only thing I dislike about the gate, but you get this with any gate is the bottom rod that you need to step over to get to the next step when your going down stairs is right in the middle of the step. Kind of awkward when you're walking up or down the stairs."
5,Great replacement for stationary gate,"Ordered this as we have an old wooden stationary gate by our front door to keep our little monster off of the stairs (and so our guests didn't have to hurdle it or take it down removing paint off the walls). Gate arrived on time, as advertised, and went up like a dream. Took a little tweaking to set the door properly, but no big deal. As far as the operation, no complaints whatsoever, we're loving it as long as we remember to use the door and not try to step over it! I also like that it's considerably taller than the other gates we have so I feel we'll get good use out of it as our almost 2 year old continues to grow (which is another reason not to step over it... if you want to have more children!). For the price you won't be disappointed."
4,Great for uneven walls,What a great product. I am using it as a dog gate and it is great. Was easy to assemble and works really well with my very uneven walls. It's sturdy enough that I did not need to screw it in to the wall. Love that it swings both ways with ease and shuts right afterwards. Just a little flick up and it opens. Great product.
1,Crap!,"At first this gate worked fine, within a few days I noticed it didn't close on its own I had to make sure it latched. After a few months despite my constant re-tightening and re-adjusting it doesn't latch closed enough and my 1 and 3 year old know how to pop it open. Waste of money, lasted literally 3 months."
2,"Extension, schmension","The extension is worthless, the tighter you try to get thing, the worse it buckles. The regular gate works just fine, but don't bother with the extension. you'll never get a good, safe fit."
4,"Really easy to install, works great","Very happy with this product. The black version is as stylish as a great big metal gate in your doorway can get, is very easy to open one handed, and the swing-shut mechanism works every time. Installation is a breeze with the double-sided tape, and the overall effect is sturdy. One criticism is that the warning labels on the floor bar are an eyesore, are stuck on with superglue and will not peel off. We need to get some goo-be-gone, which is an annoyance and the only reason this didn't get 5 stars."
2,looks nice but not durable,"I have four children, one of which the gate is for. My 8 and 6 yr olds have no problem with using the gate and my 3 and 16 m old can not. I installed it correctly and easily. It looks great. At first I loved it, especially the one hand swing close mechanism. The first week my 3 yr old got a finger pinched trying to figure out the top latch. We moved past that, since I tightened it a bit more. All was well until recently. It swings close on one side but not the other as other reviews mentioned. The problem lies within the bottom latch. We have only had this gate 3 MONTHS!! This is unsafe in my opinion. My 16M has made it to the stairs a few times and to the top of the stairs before we have gotten to her. Not good since she thinks she can stand and walk up the last step. Because I homeschool, this gate gets a lot of use and just isn't doing what it is suppose to. Now I will have to replace it. I would not recommend for high traffic area and for saftey issues."
2,"closes but doesnt lock, not good for pets","i bought this item (i actually purchased two) because i needed to keep some dogs from going into a specific room. while the dogs are respectful of the gate, which is indeed sturdy, i am very concerned. the latching mechanism is rather lacking in design. a tiny piece of plastic locks the gate closed. and YES, i installed the gate properly. the margin between locked and unlocked is not well defined, and i have found that when the gate swings closed it does not lock many times. perhaps i misread the selling points. it says that the gate closes. and indeed it does. but it does NOT say that it locks when it closes which pretty much defeats the purpose of the gate swinging closed by itself. i cannot trust this gate and will be forced to purchase a different one from a different manufacturer. Lesson learned...$110 dollar mistake."
5,LOVE this gate!,"This gate is very well made. The parts fit together nicely and was very easy to put up by myself. The gate swings both ways and shuts automatically. It's also tall enough that I can open it without bending over which is nice.I originally bought a Munchkin gate and hated it, this gate is a serious improvement over that one."
4,Decent gate,This gate is pretty good considering no tools needed! It was fairly straight forward to assemble. It does need an adjustment every now and then as the gate becomes a little loose over time.
4,Good item,"This is the second dreambaby gate that I bought for my one year old. The first one was the tall gate for the top of the stairs and this is a regular one for the bottom of the stairs. It is very easy to assemble and it fits well in standard size hallways/doorways.The only thing is that I like the tall one much better, even though it seems like the shorter one would be more comfortable... its the exact opposite, you dont have to bend down to open it with the baby in your arms unlike with the short one. This product is great, but I would recommend the tall gate over the short one."
2,Lightweight,"This gate does what its intended to do, but I would not buy it again. The construction is a bit flimsy relative to other gates we own and the locking mechanism does not seem to engage on its own. The gate does feature an automatically closing door which is nice. This one worked better in doorways then stairs."
2,Latch did not hook- probably defective,On the gate I got the gate was farther apart from where it should hook in to. I should have probably sent it back but I needed it quickly. I would advise any one else purchasing this gate to make sure it latches not only at the bottom but at the top as well. Easy to use!
2,What a Hassle!,"I purchased two of these gates. First one I installed properly, but when I went to open the gate, it fell off completely, denting my wood floors. I quickly noticed that the bolt that is supposed to hold the gate in place was missing the nut to hold it in place. Opened the second gate which had a secure bolt and installed it the same as the first. It must have been bent out of shape because only the bottom locking mechanism would line up properly. In order for the top to secure I had to force it shut, which takes the ""one-hand"" feature out of play. Also, the paint on the top of the gate was not complete, so it looked as if there was a giant scratch along the edge of the frame, even though it clearly was not scratched. If the products weren't defective, I think it would be a great gate. But after having TWO out of two gates defective, I'm done with Dream-Baby products."
2,"Good idea, major hassle","This gate didn't work for us at all. It never seemed to get balanced perfectly enough to actually latch. At one point we thought it was and our daughter pushed against it, fell through and smacked her head. Having the latching system entirely dependent upon the tension is a poor design."
1,Does Not Work For Large Dogs,"This gate has a poor design that makes it impossible to function while tightly installed in a doorway to keep medium to large dogs out of a room. In order to function, the gate must be tightly installed so that the weight of the dog will not push the gate down; however, when the gate is installed this tightly using the included fasteners, the ""swing-door"" in the center of the gate will not function because the tightness of the installation locks it in place. If you are just using this gate to maintain a small infant, it might work... anything larger and it is a failure."
3,Not really a pressure mount,"I bought this gate because it said it was a pressure mounted gate and I didn't want to ruin my walls. When it arrived, I discovered that my options were to screw the mounting cups into the walls or use the included adhesive disks to attach the mounting cups to the walls. So my options were to ruin the walls with screw holes or ruin them with adhesive residue. I overcame this issue by using the temporary adhesive strips that you pull to release, but I'm sure that the manufacturer would not approve. As far as the function of the gate goes, it's great. It's easy to open with one hand and the self-closing feature is nice so that you can't forget to close it behind you. So overall, if you're looking for a pressure mounted gate, it's probably not what you're looking for unless you do it the way I suggested. If you're not necessarily wanting it to pressure mount, this is a good choice."
2,Gates w/extension...,The extensions on this suck...you will need to order extra extension for regular hallways and stairs...if you have a narrow hallway this will work otherwise don't waste your money
5,One of the best WWI sim games out. White knuckle real!,"This is really one of the best ever. I just wish they would make more with different season , country and ground visuals . It is superb.Why has it been discontinued? It has so much potential for more!"
5,simply the best!,"IF YOU WANT THE REAL THING AND WANT TO KNOW HOW THE PILOTS IN WW11 ""DID THEIR THING"" GET THIS GAME=TAKE ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT IT FROM OTHERS WHO HAVE RATED IT AND ADD TEN PERCENT=THIS IS SO REAL RIGHT DOWN TO THE WAY YOU CRASH=WHILE ON ONE MISSION I WAS HIT BY AA FIRE AND IT BLEW MY COWLING ON MY ENGINE AND I COULD SEE ALL THE EXHAUST SYSTEM AND MOVING ENGINE PARTS=THE DETAIL THAT WAS INSTALLED ON THIS GAME IS UNEQUALED=THE PEOPLE WHO PUT THIS TOGETHER HAD PRIDE IN THEIR WORK AND IT SHOWS=JUST AN AMAZING GAME!!!!"
5,One of the best combat sims...,"I like something in particular about each of the best flight sims, CFS, CFS Pacific, Warbirds, and Air Warrior, but Jane's WWII fighters is AWESOME. A new PC upgrade recently got me back in the cockpit in VERY REAL combat and flight simulation, thanks to Electronic Arts. I like the night missions. Turn the lights off... just the red glow in the cockpit to navigate by... the graphics, scenery, and effects are spectacular. It is easy to forget to watch your six! For the PRICE, there is no better combat flight sim. In fact, some pricey sims aren't this good!"
3,Not easy going.,"May 13, 2002Having never flown an airplane, much less a WW IIfighter, I can't remark on how accurate this game is,other than to say that its maker's willingness to letplayers fly around for four or five minutes withoutthe slightest hint of the enemy is probably a goodindicator of how seriously they took their art. Isuppose air combat over Europe WAS occasionallyboring, and only sporadically murderous and thrilling.Unfortunately, the truth makes for some tiresome play.`WW II Fighters' is also a repetitive game. Themissions are very similar. What's more, you'llhave to turn the voices off--there's only so manytimes you can hear your German wing captain repeat,""Enemy buh-mers. Ruh-range: zex hundrett meters!""The graphics, while conveying distance and altitudewith precision, aren't terribly arresting.For simulator fans only."
3,OK for WW2 flight sim,"This is actualy A pretty good flight sim. The graphics are OK the sound though isnt very real. You can only fly 7 planes and they all seem to fly the same but they look very real. The menu however is realy hard to use, and the ground looks like the same little piece done over and over again same goes for the cities. The damage isnt very real either. Get this game though if you like flight sims if not then just skip it."
4,AWESOME GAME!,"In terms of graphic effects there is NO game like this one. You can actually SEE the shell casing fall out of the plane wings. Once in a furball I actually saw a piece of my plane fly out in front of me. I look left to confirm it and... my flap was shot off! The damage is real. You can see the holes punched in your plane and your enemies! Sound effects are great as well. I love hearing those 50cals hit the ground and whine as I strafed targets. I would have preferred less of the ground pounder action and more dog fighting but they were trying to be ""historical"" about it. EXCELLENT game. I am hoping to see a pacific version soon."
2,Huss,The CD was in good shape. It was not what I expected of a Christian album. I gave it to a young person who will enjoy it.
4,If you enjoy the personality behind Sookie,I've enjoyed Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series and wanted a fun series for quick airport reads. This series does the trick. Good characters and funny exchanges around a different mystery in every book.
3,Teagarden Myster,This novel was ok; I purchased it because I love the Sookie Stackhouse novels. But I was disappointed in the Teagarden series. I doubt that I will read any of the others.
2,All 6 published Teagarden books,"I have to say that after reading all 8 Sookie Stackhouse books and Lily Bard, Shakespeare's series, I am very disappointed in this series. I made myself finish them just because I just knew they'd kick in at some point and meet my expectations. It never happened. I judge a book by my wanting to re-read the books over and over. I can't say this about this series. I went out on Harris' web sight and was disappointed to hear that she would not be writing any more Shakespeare mysteries. That's ok because the series ended very well. I was disapponted when she said never say never about another Teagarden possibility. Please save your precious time writing Stackhouse books and end the Teagarden!"
3,Good mystery,"This is not as good as Grave Sight, but still a good book. It is a little slow for me, but Charlaine is too good a writer to put the book down. You just have to finish it, and you won't be disappointed . Good enough to try book 2."
2,Disappointing,"Having read many of Charlaine Harris novels this one was disappointing. The story was slow even though it involved multiple murders and two love interests. I dislike that Aurora mostly stumbles into solving the murders, I don't understand why female writers make the main characters so weak."
3,A fun mystery,"This was a fun little book. A group interested in true crime start a club called the Real Murders in small-town Georgia. Things turn sinister when someone is taking pages out of their case studies and murdering people fashioned after other cases. The main character, Aurora Teagarden, finds herself in the thick of things as she stumbles upon bodies and evidence, sometimes merely being at the wrong place at the wrong time.I admit the culprit wasn't obvious to me, so Harris did a good job ""fooling"" me until the reveal occurred. I liked Aurora Teagarden - not as well, admittedly, as Harper Connelly or Sookie Stackhouse, but I'll read more to see how this librarian grows."
3,Aurora's no Sookie,"As I anxiously wait for the next installment of the Sookie Stackhouse books (late June 2008!) I reviewed other titles by Charlaine Harris including books 1 and 2 of the Aurora Teagarden Mysteries. I bought the first two together in case I needed to read the 2nd book right away (and couldn't wait for 2 day shipping). I'm sorry to say I could have waited.The pace is slow, the writing a little childish, and Ms. Harris never manages to capture interest with her plot or her characters.I'll probably read more of these books when I need a predictable, formulaic read to help transition me to sleep... but I'll buy them used.Back to counting the days until Sookie arrives."
4,Murder She Wrote,"First I devoured all the available books in the Southern Vampire series. Excellent, but no new book until May! Next, I finished the 3 Harper Connely books. Also good, but no new book until later this year. Finally, I decided to give Aurora Teagarden a try, since I like Ms Harris' work so much. There is nothing supernatural or paranormal about this series, but Real Murders was just as entertaining as I'd hoped it would be. Finished in a few hours and will probably read the others in the series too. It reminds me of the old Angela Lansbury TV show...entertainment with a little murder and mayhem thrown into the mix, all neatly resolved in an hour's time."
3,Condition Problem,The book was listed as good condition but the spine was almost broken through and the book in general was not in good condition. I did read it but was not sure it would hold together until I finished but it did. All the pages were intact.
