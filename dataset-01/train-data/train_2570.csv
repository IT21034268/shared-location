4,Great for the lazy computer worker. Like Me.,"Perfect for a small desktop. Although the picture shows a tower underneath, the unit works better with a small desktop on top and the monitor on top of that. Accessories and caddies can go below as well as a small printer.Assembly was a little tedious for one person. Very fast for two. It's decorative enough to keep in the living room with the finish facing out. When I use the computer I pull the cart towards me while on my big sofa. Nap and work at the same time.Good quality for the price. Not suitable for a business but great for the average computer user."
1,disappointed,"I purchased this for my classroom and really enjoyed it but it only lasted for two months. I purchased it during the summer so by the time it stopped working in October, it was too late to return it."
5,Excellent source and introduction,"As a teacher of Earth Science and Biology, I have used this series since it was first available.It is beautifully filmed, has a wonderful soundtrack, and every second is full of information.Kids are captivated by it's imagery and when used as a video lecture, they absorb a ton of information.The concept of the Gaia Principle demonstrates the big picture, which uniquely ties together Biology and Earth Science and offers an excellent starting point for both.After the first 10 minutes, they are hooked and thirsty for more."
1,not working,i can not give a review. it did jump it only played the song. it cost more to return so i keeped it.
4,Exactly what I needed,"The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is that it was shipped a little carelessly. The cartridge was in pieces in the bag and I had to reassemble it first. Not a big deal, just scared me when I opened it. Worked great in the end."
1,A.S. is sub par to what they used to be.,"American Standard is not what they used to be. Their parts do not last and are not built to industry standards. By this statement I mean the parts have a less than acceptable operating lifespan and when they fail, with their proprietary design they have to be replaced as a unit rather than a part. With a normal faucet you replace a rubber washer that costs less than a dollar, not an entire valve stem at 15 + dollars. I will NEVER replace a faucet or any other pluming apparatus with any American Standard product. There are too many competitors of equal or better quality for the money."
2,Great service from Amazon.. BUT...,"Bought this part to fix an issue with an American Standard bathroom faucet which I bought brand new about 6 years ago.While I couldn't be happier with Amazon having the part available and shipping it quickly, I'm still shaking my head that the original part went bad in the first place after only 6 years of very light use.This is the second American Standard faucet that went bad on me in a very short time. Do yourselves a favor and AVOID American Standard products at all costs. While they may look good on the outside, they are junk on the inside.I'm only expecting 5 or 6 years out of this replacement stem, after which, I'll install a Moen or Kohler brand."
5,Buy extra it works,"I bought my American Standard bathroom sink faucet at Home Depot but could not find a replacement cartridge at any of the local stores or online (did not have part number). The faucet was a match set to my shower faucet and I could not find another replacement sink faucet that was even close in style. So when I saw this cartridge on Amazon.com, I was skeptical whether it would be the right size, but after reading other reviews with a similar stories I took the chance because it was only a $10, not a big loss if it didn't work. I actually had been without hot water for two month in this bathroom, so when the cartridge was a perfect match I was really pleased. I went ahead and ordered two more, and put them in the cabinet under the sink for future replacement (Maybe I should put the Amazon.com part number in the cabinet as well..it's a great faucet and should last for years)."
4,Cute. But somewhat unsportsmanlike.,"My son loves this book. Although, to be truthful, he loves pretty much anything with a train in it. I don't mind the book, which is about all I ask for out of his train stories. This one is short and cute and not too annoying to read six times in a row.However... It seems to me that Thomas wins this race because he cheats. Maybe that's unfair of me. Maybe he just wins by using all of his advantages, ie a tunnel that is marked ""Unsuitable for large engines."" But I don't really see the difference between what Thomas does and a runner who cuts across the race track and declares that he won his race even though he didn't actually run the whole thing... Thomas comes across to me as a complete brat and every time I finish the story, I find myself pointing out to my son that I really don't think the ""victory"" counts."
5,"Adorable, Easy Reader, Substantial Story","""Catch Me, Catch Me"" is one of the very best easy-readers that I have seen. The story is simple, yet substantial and suspenseful. The 'biggest' words in the story are ""tunnel,"" ""bridge,"" and ""plan."" When my kids were younger, there were some books that made me cringe at the thought of reading them yet again, but it was always a pleasure to read (or hear) this one, no matter how many times my kids asked for it. Years ago, a college fellow worked with my son with autism, and my son read this book to him on a regular basis -- except the last page had torn out and was lost. The fellow told me that one day he drove past a bookstore and almost stopped to go in and find this book to read the last page to find out how it ends. I did not spoil the story for him, and ordered a new one right away. It's a wonderful little book that children ages 3-6 (or more) are sure to enjoy. It is a book I remember fondly. Great little book!"
2,Not good for reading aloud,"This book might be good for a kid who is learning to read on his or her own, but it is very, very dull to read aloud. Due to the limited vocabulary (50 words), there is little characterization or description-- just a very simplified communication of what is happening in the race between Thomas and Gordon. The illustrations are good, but the vocabulary and concepts are not challenging or imaginative. My son, who is two and a half, loves Thomas enough to request the reading of even this awful book, so I may have to hide it."
2,Not as represented,"This watch was represented as being water resistant to 200m however it didn't stand up to a hot shower, the underside of the crystal was so fogged up as to be unreadable. This watch was right out of the box , the back has never been off, and yes, the screw down stem was in the proper position."
2,Not as good as expected for the price,"I just received the watch this evening. The dial is black, not white as stated in the product description and the bezel is black, not green as shown in the picutre. It feels like a toy watch, not as sturdy as the ""Protector"" name implied. It is one very uncommon time that Amazon did not sell me the quality that I expected for the watch. I wish that I had read the reviews before. I think that it should be sold for only US $40"
1,I returned the watch,This seemed to be an okay watch but one of the numerals (the 3) had absolutely no illumination so I returned it.
4,another disco diva,"The first evelyn Thomas album. Very disco, never got a minor hit but it's pleasent!"
4,A Satisfactory Second Effort,"It is a good disco album. Though not in the ranks of Donna Summer-""Once Upon a Time"" or Thelma Houston-""Any Way You Like It"", it is compitant. Her vocal are good but sounds a lot better on her 80's albums. Casual fans of Evelyn Thomas should get the ""Best of Evelyn Thomas"" cd. More dedicated fans of her songs and disco/hi-nrg should get this. The best songs are ""Have a Little Faith in Me"", ""Love In the First Degree"" & ""Sleaze"". The worst tracks are ""Weak Spot""& ""No Time to Turn Around""."
1,Spelling counts!,"Didn't anyone check the artwork before misspelling the name of this great band? So many wonderful recordings, yet they are treated like poor stepchildren when it comes to their re-releases. Sad."
5,Very Good Looking and Well Made.,I bought several of these braclets to give as Christmas gifts. Everyone I gave one to was very well received. They are very well made and not flimsey as some of the beaded bracelets I've purchased.
2,tries hard,"Old Chuck tries hard in both Firewalker and Hero & The Terror to present a new, softer image. Were it not for the fact that Chuck appears to radiate such charisma this character change would fail completely.Both these titles are essential for Chuck fans but to anyone else: Fiewalker is just plain ropey and Hero & The Terror slightly boring."
5,A Great Way to Stimulate Your Creativity,"I've been a long time fan of the Creative Whack Pack. I recently got ""A Whack on the Side of the Head"" and discovered that it is a just as powerful creativity stimulant. I love the stories and the exercises. Highly recommended."
2,Disappointing,"This is a disappointing revision of a classic book. Less than 30% had been revised. The reader is well advised to re-read the original. Or if you've never read the original, than, by all means, get the revision."
2,Sort of rehash,"Sort of a rehash of the original book, which was excellent. I would have enjoye a more original treatment, instead of a simple update."
1,Whack me! Kick Me! For wasting my money,Please I deserve it for buying both of his books at the same time and wasting still more money. Very disappointed to say the least. Simplistic. He repeats concepts over and over. Might be good for a junior high or high school class.There are many more books along this line you'd do better to buy.
2,Disappointing,"After reading the rave reviews, I expected a much better book. It's okay, but, basically, goes over the same old stuff other books do. Nothing new. It's kinda of read one you've read them all."
2,Living In Fantasy Land,"This book has been around a long time (1983) and has gone through 3 editions. Obviously it is not without charm and appeal. One reason is because the author stresses the more fantasy oriented role of the creative thinker. By using exercises that are ambiguous and metaphors to make his point such as comparing the more creative, diffused, playful `soft' thinker to the `hard' more logical, rational, reality thinker, people get lost in this book the same way they do in an Alice and Wonderland tale. Creative, Heinrich Kley inspired illustrations by George Willett add to the magical setting. However, the author does not offer any concrete plan to increase creativity, as is done in 'The Creativity Formula' (www.creativityformula.com), and one comes away from this book with the same euphoric feeling one might get after watching a Peter Pan movie. ""Oh, if only I could fly.""Gerard Bianco author of the mystery novel, Dying For Deception (www.dyingfordeception.com)"
1,You deserve a whack on the head if you buy this piece of tripe,I found this book to be patronizing and condescending. Maybe it's great for professional trainers who are also patronizing and condescending? It seems likely that this book's success is largely dependent upon the publisher having a good marketing strategy.
3,It's ok,"Lots of interesting things, not really anything earthshaking. However, I very much enjoyed the humor and found myself laughing a lot."
4,A good thought provoker (whack),"I found this to be a very entertaining read and did often have me looking at things from a different perspective. I will have to take a look at the author's whack pack to see if it can help stimulate more ideas.I found a lot of value at the end of the book when covering the second whack. Understanding where you are taking your ideas is key and knowing when you need to be in explorer, artist, judge, or warrior mode is a great way to think about it."
3,Did Little for me,"This book is eloquently written, and I agree with most of what it says. But I haven't felt that it is helping me to be more creative."
3,Not to sell with Creative Whack Pack,This book is already included in the Creative Whack Pack book and make no sense to buy it apart.Don't know what to do with it now!
3,The case studies are interesting but not the author's,"I gave this book 3 stars because it does contain information regarding the fasting experience that is from a variety of sources. There are short and medium length case histories of the affects of fasting on wide variety of the population. What I found kind of silly was the author's description of her own month long fasting experience. She kept a diary but seemed to not have had much insight into her own personal self. Instead she gives dry comments on who was feeling good that day and her developing crush on one of the guest who is quite religious. She also talks about her lapse from the recommendations of the clinic and Herbert Shelton in general. But, unfortunately she doesn't explore it in a way that would be of help to those people who fall of the band wagon. As a study recently pointed out in the diet industry people lose weight all the time but very few of them manage to keep that weight off."
5,A very detailed account of the author's stay in a fasting clinic,"I learned a lot from this book. The author is not a doctor, but her detailed account of her stay in a fasting clinic provides a lot of information."
4,The distillation of the music-as-thought construct,"Rabelais is brave in that he doesn't shy away from the sometimes naked electronification of these works for piano by early 20th Century music illuminati.For whereas these may originally have been intended as pseudo-trancendental thought-to-music impromptus, their re-translation through wires and transistors and chips and accumulated-error computer processes perhaps yields more about their nature than their authors might have imagined.Fragile and exotic. Music for and of unfettered reflection."
1,Cashing in,"I met Michael S. Kimmel on the Bertice Barry show where he was representing the interests of blacks versus white men. (Like most ""3rd generation"" American Indians, I pretty much look like any other white guy.) His position was that white men are privileged from birth by virtue of being white and, in the interests of leveling the playing field it's time white men put themselves at a relative disadvantage. As a published college professor, he is one of the most privileged white men in the country. Since he didn't seem anxious to give that up, one would have to assume he belongs to that class of elitists who expect to receive special dispensation from sharing those disadvantages."
3,R.J.'s Latest Arrival (Shackles)...,"To be fair, I listened to this CD several times in a row, to see if anything other than ""Shackles"" stood out among this collection. Frankly, nothing did. Maybe this explains the price (about $9/US) that I paid for it. Don't get me wrong, ""Shackles"" is an outstanding tune! I just wish I could say the same for the rest of the disc.I rate this disc - 3 stars!"
4,great product,"Parts were exactly same as factory. Parts seem very well made. Easy to follow directions, bought a couple extra to keep handy."
4,WHAT A WONDERFUL READ,"I will have to admit that I really loved M.F. letter to the reader at the beginning of the story. An excellent comment on virginity. Old fashion? No, just common sense!Well, millionaire bachelor Grand O'Hara was not into a ""real"" marriage - imagine his surprise when his ""pretend"" marriage was not just another Mardi Gras festivity.He found that the ""marriage"" to shy Cheyenne Tarantino was legal and he had just met her. Could he play honeymoon with his shy, beautiful bride as nothing could be done until morning?Cheyenne saw no reason to fall into Grant's plan as she had vowed long ago to save herself for a ""real"" wedding night.Follow a really wonderful love story that makes you forget that it is only a book. That you are not really there. Ahhh!Definitely Recommended with a couple of added pluses"
5,FANTASTIC!,"these jeans are absurdly comfortable and flattering. they're like wearing denim tights - stretchy, no binding, just comfortable. and they make your legs look like they go on for days. yay! I'm buying 3 more pairs."
5,Kick ass CD- MUST SEE LIVE!!,This CD rocks. I saw the band perform live when they opened for Bret Michaels and their songs really sounded awesome! I bought the CD and I Love it! You have to buy this CD and see the band play live! Their cover songs are awesome as well!!
2,"Same ol' cup of soup, +1/2","Big pop rock sound, big chorus, big production. Sounds like all that Bon Jovi, Def Leppard stuff so many loved in the 80's. Singer is good enough to do without the auto-tune, I guess they were just playing with various effects just for the heck of it. Generous double CD with 30 songs, so if you love this sort of thing, you will be in heaven (a little pun), otherwise many will tire of it before you hit the second disc. Wonder where they got all the $ to put this out."
1,Sorry I purchased this!,"I was told to buy this record from a friend at college & that they were a good local band. The songs are fluffed with special effects, generic,and un-original not to mention very cliche and predictable. quite frankly a waste of money!If you like a bad version of Def Leppard you may like this record"
4,A little expensive online.,"Purchasing this product locally is no longer an option. It is a little more expensive online. A moderate amount of dust in this bag but I have dealt with worse.I have a large pressure tumbler that helps with washing and for the initial wash I use rain water that I recycle for outside plants. Next, I wash til clear with tap water then I allow them to dry out in a fine mesh wire basket. I finish with pHed water for the last soak."
3,Didnt receive package listed,I received a plain package that says clay pebbles. PLANT!T is the name brandThe pebbles seem tiny compared to others Ive seen. This maybe the leftovers they dont sell as actual hydroton and they bag it up in plain bags and call it clay pellets.Hopefully will still work in hydro system
3,it's ok,"Good price, not very good quality. I presoaked them overnight before using them, but they still dried quickly. I used it for my phal, and it ended up dying. I had used hydroton before and my phal was ok with it. I guess this time it was bad luck? Not sure..."
3,Good Freshman Outing,"This album is definitely worth a listen. By today's standards this piece of work would be considered 'retro' music. It's content was a popular regional hit in the Philly metro area in the mid-80's. Bryan Loren's vocals are a bit weak, but the groove-driven musical ideas are more than enough to entertain the listener. You may hear influences of Quincy Jones, Prince, Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson here, but the amalgamation of sound is strikingly unique considering that the artist is about 18 years of age at the time of the recording, is playing most of the instruments, and is self-produced. I believe that this artist was one of the great potential artists of his generation as evidenced by this freshman outing. He has extraordinary talent that makes one long for a subsequent body of work (as a solo artist) that is absent to date. Buy this one for your post-disco, fusion funk, R&B; archives.- PJ"
5,Take All Of Me,"I can't believe every place I've read about Loren's music...was all about Lollipop Love. When that CD came out, the first station to play his song was KBLX and they played the slow song, ""Take All Of Me"". When I heard that, I called the station up for the artist's name and was at the store the next day buying his CD. Just for that one beautiful song. The other jams on the CD was a nice bonus, but that one slow song did it up just right for me."
5,to-the-point nifty little bible,"Another great official book from Microsoft Press, as soon as u pick it up with it's shinny semi-hardback cover and unusual size u know it's going to be a treasure. The no nonsense language and wide variety of topics make it a little bible for refering to time and again. I was compitant with most of the content but the little extra' make a good dba from a bland one. Great for first time or intermediate. Not for very advanced dba's."
2,Wouldn't buy it . . .,"I read the wonderful reviews this book got and ran to the store to buy it. I run a small school district network and had several real world issue's I was looking for resolution to before purchasing it . . . this book did not help with one.This might be an OK book to learn the basics (thus the 2 stars), but it has no troubleshooting tips or advanced network issues that gave me any real world help.Several hours, 3 NT4 books and 2 cell phone calls from my wife asking where I was later, I left with the Windows NT4 Administrators Survival Guide.These other reviews must have been written by the authors relatives!"
5,Perfect!!,"Contains nothing but useful information, yet covers everything. If you have at least some previous knowledge and understanding of NT 4.0 this book is an excellent resource. It deals with topics from drive array configuration and TCP/IP considerations to Managing Users and Groups. Everything is laid out and explained in a concise, to the point, easy to read format. Read it cover to cover for an overview/review of NT 4.0 or keep it with you as a reference tool."
5,Faster than expected,"I'll have to admit that I haven't actually used this at all because I sent it as a gift to a friend in another state. However, she loved it and the only complaint that she had was that it accelerated faster than she expected... I guess that she got into a couple accidents at first. So be easy on the accelerator or make sure you've got a large open space, and this should be an excellent toy."
1,Disappointed with build quality,"This was purchased with enthusiasm for my son's birthday present. We received the first in damaged condition (the antenna was broken off the control unit). It worked in very close range. However, the battery life was horrendous. The replacement had an intact antenna but similarly brief battery life. We returned this.I'd give negative stars if I could."
3,A somewhat dated classic,"I first heard this album in the early 80's when Depeche Mode, Yazoo (or Yaz in the US) and other synth bands were the rage, and I rated this amongst the finest of the genre. However having recently purchased it and listened to it again, it does not seem to have aged well. But then the whole lightweight synthpop of that time seems to have suffered the same fate. That said, although the sound is dated, the songs still have strong melodies while the lyrics are kept to a minimun. This was certainly an influencial album in it's time and anyone wishing to trace the roots of Hip Hop will be well advised to buy this. If you are still into the 80's sythpop, then this is a good one for you as well."
4,"""Ooh, we like it!""","The only reason I got this album, the original vinyl album, was for the song HEATSTROKE. Fast, hyper, fun loving cut with voice male electro and female chorus backdrops, it's a great dance cut. But, I originally heard it in a sleazy film where a lone fellow is breezing through the decadant part of the big city sidewalks. For some reason it stuck, but that's not what it's all about, is it?"
5,...,"...What a convenient means of avoiding having to actually engage with Skrabanek's arguments. Would you say that most health promoters have a vested interest in establishing links between disease and all sorts of factors, since their jobs depended on it? Most medical researchers accept money from drug companies; indeed, many of the most vocal proponents of organic farming and opponents of genetically modified foods are themselves organic farmers, with an obvious vested economic interest in promoting it.But none of that means you can airily dismiss their arguments out of hand. I would urge medical students, doctors, nurses, and the general public, to read this book: make up your own mind."
2,This is a tobacco industry funded propaganda piece.,"The New Scientist (16 May 98 p5) points out that the fist author of this book is one of many 'consultant' projects funded by the tobacco industry to help spread confusion on the relationship between tobacco and health. Peter Skrabanek is reported to have written a number of reports for the tobacco industry. Caveat emptor. It may be a good read, but it is a subtle part of tobacco industy propaganda."
4,"Thai-English English-Thai Dictionary for Non-Thai Speakers, Revised Edition (Dictionary)",The book seems to cover most of the words I might need. The problem that I am having is the transliteration font is too small and light.
3,I wouldn't know,"Read through some pages myself and I'm like ""Eh""The only person who could tell you how well it worked was the person I bought it for and I'm guessing since he was able to go to most parts of Thailand and have a hell of a time, then this book must have helped."
4,Good reference book.,"This is a thorough thai-english dictionary. One of the few as Thai language books do not seem as plentiful as other Asian languages. My one complaint and it is a big problem with the book is that the Thai script is printed too small for a non Thai reader to discern. So many Thai characters look so similar anyway, the tiny printing makes it really difficult to read."
3,It's all right.,"I would recommend this book to people who want to speak Thai but don't know how to read and write it. This is because once you know the Thai alphabet, you can usually pronounce words the correct way by just looking at them. This is from my own personal experience. I wouldn't bother with this book because when I compared the written Thai word to the English phonetic or how my Thai teacher said the word, they were sometimes not the same pronunciation, but similar. And similar doesn't cut it when trying to speak this language because you could be saying something else ;) But honestly, it's pretty good for speakers and even the tone-deaf."
2,print microscopic,"print microscopic, common words missing, small book, not what I expect from Benjawan, her stuff is sually so good. This is a waste of money"
2,Could be better,This book disappointed me and is not thorough enough. I would have been better off going with an academic quality dictionary like the Oxford Thai Dictionary.
4,Not the end-all and be-all but necessary...,"Bad news:Print is too small. Anyone with eyes over 40 years old will be looking for a magnifying glass to supplement their glasses, just as one needs one to read the message he is printing here. But dictionaries are supposed to be reference materials, not teaching resources. I wrote to the publisher and asked if there was a version for people with real eyes. His response was that what you see (or don't see) is what you get.In both Thailand and the U.S. I haunted bookstore after bookstore for a more flexible dictionary and found none.Good news: in conjunction with other learning guides, this dictionary is the best. If you want to learn pronunciation, get something on disk.Until someone comes out with something in larger print, this is as good as you'll get."
5,Thai Dictionary,"This is the best dictionary on Thai I have seen to date, and I have looked at a lot of them. Although the transliterationsystem (The Romanized version for English speakers) is probably the most unique and difficult to learn and remember, will easily result in the most accurate pronounciation. The transliteration system is worth learning, and puts all other transliteration systems in second class (as far as winding up with the correct pronounciation) at best.The book has English-to-Romanized-Thai, Romanized-Thai-to English, and ""real""-Thai-script-to-English, easily makingit the most useful of all the ones I have seen to date.As this dictionary is fairly comprehensive, it is also a bit thick, making it a little difficult to travel with, but this dictionary is a MUST for anyone trying to learn any Thai atall."
4,Awesome shelter,"This shelter is fairly easy to set up but if you lack experience setting up a shelter then I would highly recommend you practice prior to doing it in some remote location.The stakes that come with the shelter are suitable for most types of terrain. However, if you're planning on taking it to the beach, I would recommend getting much longer stakes. You have to pull this thing REALLY taut and the stakes that come with it just don't hold well in the sand.I highly recommend this shelter. It does a superb job of blocking the elements and it's very compact and light for such a big shelter."
5,My daughter loves it.,We've had the watch a month now. It looks very nice for the price. She loves the colors and simplicity of it. Very classy watch.
5,Discovering What God has done for you,"Every believer thinks he understands the Parable of the Prodigal Son well enough. Read this and you will discover new depths of what Jesus was trying to communicate to His listners. Instead of focusing on the wild and wasteful son the story really is focused on the prodigal father (who represents God). The father is really the wild and extravagant one because he pours out so much mercy, grace, and blessing upon his undeserving son. In this book you will feel God wooing you to Himself. The believer who reads this book will rediscover God's unconditional love, overflowing grace and perhaps see his identity and authority as a Child of God in brilliant light for the first time. The one who has not yet come into a saving relationship with God will find an irresistable tug of grace from God. You will run to Him because of His steadfast loving-kindness to you. He wants you to come home and He has provided the way."
1,Bad quality/missing parts,The dressers that we currently order for the classrooms are rather sub-standard. Invariably there is one or more of the following problems with each unit upon unpacking:--Screws are missing--Screws are damaged and unusable and there are no extras--Holes are drilled in the wrong place-- Dowel pins are glued into the wrong holes--They are relatively hard to assemble and the temporary guys assembled several wrongOf the 12 units that were assembled there were only 2 that had all of the necessary hardware in the correct locations.We will not be purchasing these again.
4,looks great but will take a little patience to put together,"We bought this 5 drawer chest for our son's nursery in cognac. It looks great in the nursery and is very sturdy. The price is good and this was the only amber wood we could match up to the crib we bought which was a Babysdream Serenity crib in amber. The only thing that is frustrating about this dresser is putting it together. Give yourself about 4 hours with the help of another person. Be patient and don't try to hammer in any screws on the back to save time. My husband lost his patience and started to hammer the backboard into the dresser and it splintered a little of the wood. Thank goodness you can't see where we messed it up. This dresser does take patience but looks like you spent some money on it. I would deem it very sturdy. Great buy overall, I am happy with it."
3,looks good but build is horrible,"this furniture piece looks great, its as simple to assemble as possiblebut as is the case with all malasia and china furniture the thing is as flimsy as the restdont think you are getting a quality item for 200 buckstop and drawer fronts are 1/2 wood all the rest is particle boardknobs wont last, the screws are too small for the drilled holesall in all its worth 100 bucks in my mind"
3,"Looks good, but it is too expensive for the true value","The drawer chest looks very nice, but it is not as steardy as you would expect for the price. One of the drawers even came with a problem. The main structure crosses one of the drawers so it decreases the space."
4,Time consuming!,"The product meets its specifications. It was a lot of work and time to assemble it, impossible to do alone."
3,5 Drawer Chest,"Looks very nice but not as sturdy as I would have hoped. Also, the drawers kept falling apart until I added glue to hold in the screws. All in all though I do like the look of this drawer."
3,Cam-locks arent the best,"This dresser is perfect for what I wanted but I found that some of the Cam-locks (the screws that they give you for assembly) arent doing their jobs properly. In a couple of the drawers, the cam-locks kept falling out and the front would fall off of the drawers so finally I just got some Gorilla Wood Glue and glued all of the drawer pieces together. It hasnt fallen apart since.Not the best product out there, and a little under par for the price, but still gets the job done and great for those on a budget."
5,Awesome Deal!,This chest is a quality piece of furniture. You won't find anything comparable in this price range. The color (espresso) is beautiful!
2,broke missing parts,"I bought the complete set for our new grandaugter, attempted to put dresser together to find a broken drawer and missing hardware!!!! Disapointing as this is the 1st of 3 items they have to put together, not to promising:("
5,Beautiful!,"My mom bought this for my unborn son's nursery and I absolutely love it! It is very sterdy, the drawers are safe, it has a great finish, and it is beatiful!!! Also, it has tons of space inside! My boyfriend put it together and he didn't have any trouble with it - however it does take a few long hours because it has a lotttttt of parts! 115 pounds there!! lol but yeah I absolutely love this chest and would highly recomend it!"
4,troubles aside it is good for the money,"You get what you pay for. The product is NOT solid wood. The top, drawer fronts and trim pieces are solid wood made with small boards similar to a cutting board. The drawer sides and backs are particle board that is of a large grain. The back panel is fiber board with a plastic strip in the middle. Assembly is pretty easy. We had one wrong part, the rear base board. I had to modify it with a router for it to be correct...not too hard but a pain. The only other complaint is when installing the drawer rails the screw holes are not properly drilled. I had at least half of the side panels split because of not being drilled...so be careful. I should have re done the pre drilling of holes but didn't. Overall it still better quality than what we found in local stores for the same money or a lot more. It is heavy..take the drawers out when moving it."
3,Okay dresser,"Pros:looks great with matching glider and cribeasy to put togetherwill grow with childhave lock so they wont pull out all the waycons:drawer bottms are very thin and cheapNot bad. I would buy it again becasue it makes our glider and crib, but not my favorite product"
1,Stork Craft Beatrice 5 Drawer Chest-will be returning,"I purchased this for my granddaughter, and it is so cheaply manufactured, it is unusable and must be returned.The dresser falls apart when any one drawer is opened. In fact, the front of one drawer was routed so that it would have had to be put on upside down! (they did send another drawer front)The back of this piece of ""furniture"" is the thinnest of cardboard.I am very disappointed in the lack of quality, even though I did not expect an heirloom piece for the price, this was just terrible.The only positive is the customer service that allows me to return it."
2,Regret putting this on my Baby Registry,My husband put the dresser together and had a lot of trouble because many of the screw holes were so bad the screws wouldn't hold. They were stripped before he even started. The outside pieces are pretty sturdy but the drawers are cheap and the tracks probably won't hold up for long or with much weight in them. This is a big disappointment. I want to return it but my husband said no since he was finally able to get it together. I wouldn't recommend this dresser to anyone.
1,Disappointed,Too much assembly. The only parts we did not have to put together were not level. The dresser looks cheap and like I was not sober assembling it.I would not recommend this dresser at all.1 star because the wood sides and top look nice.
5,Cheaper at Walmart.com,This is an absolutely beautiful chest of drawers!!!! I bought it sight unseen (well I didn't find it anywhere to see it in person) and for the price I really expected to receive some cheap flimsy chest. To my surprise it is pretty solid. The drawers are made of veneer wood but the rest is solid wood. I especially like the smooth semi glossy white color. I have to say the picture is a little deceiving and leads you to think the drawers are deep. The front part is tall but the sides are more shallow. I would recommed getting this 5 drawer instead of the 3 or 4 drawer if you are requiring more storage space. I put this together myself toward the end of my pregnancy with the easy to follow picture directions. All you need is a phillips screwdriver and you are set. Overall if you don't want to fork over an extravagant amount of money this is definitly worth the price.
2,I guess you get what you pay for,"Ok, so the dresser was only $200 (plus shipping), but I would have rather had a little more drawer space. The fronts of the drawers measure almost 9"", but the insides are only 3-1/2"" deep!!!! As others have said, the front of the drawers and outer casing of the dresser are pretty solid, but the drawers themselves are particle board. It took about an hour to put together and according to my husband, the instructions were easy to follow and there were no pieces missing. I would only recommend this item if you are looking for a dresser that looks nice but don't need a lot of storage space."
1,Ugh,"I wish I could give it 0 stars. Very flimsy, horrible...unfortunately there is no way I can dismantle it and pack it back to return, ...what a waste"
2,Don't bother,Drawers only open 6 in. Company says its because of safety laws. Almost impossible to get to the back of the drawers. I would assume this is the same with all of their dressers. Worthless!!
3,Not very sturdy,"I bought this for my teen age son's bedroom to match his new bed and bookcases. We had been trading out for several months and this was the last purchase. I understand now why it is a ""stork"" brand. It is only sufficient to hold baby clothes. Not very sturdy at all. We have since switched back to his Ponderosa Pine dresser. We had to sand it down and refinish it and attach some new accessories, but it will last many many years more. It lasted 16 years already. So if you are looking for a baby dresser. You found it. If you are looking for something more sturdy, KEEP LOOKING!!!"
1,Do not buy,"I bought this piece because I had purchased this brand of furniture for my other son and loved it. This particular dresser is a piece of junk. It resembles something from Target, rickety and not durable. I am sorry we bought it!"
2,stork craft dresser,"The instructions were easy enough to follow, but the camlocking mechanisms to secure the parts of the dresser were either too small or the holes were drilled too large. They easily fell out of the holes when even the slightest amount of movement shook the parts.Trying to install the top was even a bigger nightmare. Save yourself the headaches and heartaches, for what the dresser cost, go buy one already assembled and enjoy your evening."
2,Came in broken - still waiting for new parts,"I have a feeling that this item is simply not packaged correctly. The two main parts, left side board and right side board, both came in totally cracked. When I called in to order replacements, the customer service rep knew exactly what I'm calling to re-order. ?!?!?! If it's a known problem, why not fix it?!The customer service reps are very nice, but the fact that the spare parts take forever to ship really doesn't make this product very attractive. The processing itself takes 2-3 weeks. In my case, 3 weeks later, I found out that my 2 parts are on back-order, awaiting shipment by container from Brazil. So it will be at least 2 more weeks until they arrive and 1 more week until I receive it. I hope the dresser arrives before the baby..."
2,None of the pieces had all the parts!,"We bought the combo/tower and hutch and this 5-drawer dresser. With the tower and hutch, the errors were just in how many of which screws there were, and we were able to make up the difference.With the dresser, not only did they send us not enough of the short screws, but they sent us ten LEFT drawer sides, instead of five left and five right. There is no way they can be substituted for one another, and now we have to have them exchange parts... the baby is due in just a few weeks - I hope we'll have the dresser in time.Additionally, the boxes were SO damaged in shipping (by FedEx) that we were afraid we'd have to return them. The wood was a little scratched, but not too terribly.The furniture is great stuff, but I'd buy it at the store so you can count the pieces before you even go home. It seems like the error is not in their quality, but in their brains."
4,Easy to put together,Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
3,So far so Good,"For nearly $200, this dresser could have used higher quality materials. I'm not talking oak or anything, but the laminates and particleboards are pitifully brittle. I was assembling it, and even a light accidental swipe from a slipped screw driver chipped off a 1 inch by .4 inch chunk of the board. All in all, if you're very careful with assembly and use, it will look nice and be functional. But don't even think about moving it or keeping it long term because it will fall apart if you try to relocate."
5,Solid High Quality Chest For $200 +/-,"I've read others reviews and I must admit the drawer design does leave something to desire but...this is a chest for a ""BABY"". That is why you'll loose some storage space if you store adult clothing. The drawers are designed the way they are because baby clothes are small. DUH!!! As for the look and quality of the chest, it is top notch for the price. Go to any furniture store in your town try to buy something similar to this chest and it will set you back $499 or more."
1,Will not recommend,Cracks while trying to set up. Looks very cheap and not worth spending over $200 on. It does not durable at all and I had to send it back though I bought it for my baby that is due a week from today. PLEASE DO NOT BUY.
2,Not sturdy at all..looks nice though!,"This drawer chest arrived in 2 days of order. Color is nice espresso which we liked. The quality of the product is very cheap. Only the outer frame of furniture is lil better in quality than the inside.Assembly is lil confusing because the pieces are not marked, so we guessed looking at the picture and did it in 2-3 hrs. We ordered this chest because it has 5 drawers and for the price the drawers were the widest and deepest we could get but they are verrry shallow, only half of what appears from outside. Its strictly for babies light weight stuff b/c its not sturdy at all. I guess we are still keeping it knowing it wont last more than a year or two."
3,not so impressed,The dresser is nice to look at but is very cheap quality. I am not impressed. I bought this for my boys room and I don't think it will last more than a year or two.
3,Not bad,"We purchased this 5 drawer dresser, the combo changing tower and hutch, and the Rochester crib. I put this together myself (at 6 months pregnant) and had no problems. One comment, although the combo tower and dresser are both from Storkcraft, the screws and hardware were different in that the combo tower had much better screws. It definitely went together better than the dresser. I don't think the dresser is the quality of the combo tower, but it is perfect for what we want it for. I'll let you know when we get to the crib. It is a really pretty piece of furniture though, beautiful color (oak) and no damage."
1,piece of junk,"what a piece of junk. i did not receive directions, or any hardware. only three of the 20 some pieces were not damaged. There was absolutely no care taken when packaged for shipping. Although I don't think any of the damage came from shipping. I see boot marks on the pieces and all are totally scracted up. This company is terrible"
1,Item came broken,The dresser required assembly - some of the pieces were broken. For what I paid it was very disappointing.
1,Fallen Apart,This dresser has completely fallen apart within the first year we've owned it. The dresser itself and also the drawers are all falling apart. I'm surprised it's still standing and I would not recommend this product to anyone.
5,An invaluable reference book!,"We recently began receiving produce from our CSA in Amherst, Massachusetts, and we would be lost without this book. It has helped us to identify and distinguish between the assortment of greens we receive, and has instructions for optimal storage, preparation and cooking techniques for an array of produce. Highly recommended!"
4,A good by-the-vegetable cookbook for CSAs,"Generally a handy cookbook to have available, especially for new CSA members or people looking to branch out to some locally grown produce. It's best used in the ""I have this vegetable and have to make something out of it"" way. Some recipes are unusual (this can be both good and bad)and I would estimate about 85% of the recipes are vegetarian. I'm glad I bought it, and it usually gets my first look, but I do go sometimes go elsewhere for recipes."
5,Easy to use!,"I recently purchased a share in a local CSA and have been receiving a variety of vegetables that I haven't had a lot of experience preparing or storing. This book has been so easy to use! All produce is arranged alphabetically with a few pages of recipes for that particular vegetable. What I really like is that each produce listing has a page dedicated to information on short and long term storage options, as well as simple ideas for adding the vegetable to your own recipes. This book has been an invaluable resource! I highly recommend it."
2,There's This River,"Absolutely wonderful book! We read some of the stories out loud in camp during a private rafting trip down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. Some had us laughing, some had us crying but all were moving in some way. The artwork and illustrations are a terrific bonus. If you love rafting, outdoor adventure or just having an ""armchair adventure""....get this book, guaranteed you will love it!"
4,It's a great tool,"I've noticed a few others haven't liked this program. All I have to say is that I found it to be a usefull tool. I was completely blocked when I started looking for a job after three years. I had only a really old resume (somthing that was great for entry level..but not for someone who's been in the work force for awhile). This software allows you to keep your job search organized. I love the fact that you can customize each resume and letter. Heck I used this program to write my cover letters, thank you letters and my letter of resignation.It won't do the work for you and like anything you get what you put into it. But I found this one to be a keeper and I reccomend it to anyone who's having a little problem getting started on your job seach...HAPPY HUNTING! Oh and I started my new job on Monday at a nice pay raise..."
3,Check First!,"If you're thinking about purchasing Retrospect Express 5.6 to backup your system with a CD-R/RW device, be sure to check with Dantz Development first to determine if they support your specific device...It could save you lots of time and hassle if your device is not supported by Dantz for Retrospect Express 5.6. Good luck!"
2,backup disaster,"I loaded the program on my computer and started to try a backup onto CD as recommended in the manual. It immediately caused my computer to freeze up and crash. Several more attempts to use it resulted in the same results so to date, this program is worthless. Tried to call customer support but was placed on hold for over 30 min. so gave up. Someone ought to get their act together if this is get any more market share in the software business. It is my first Dantz product and will be my last!!!"
1,Download Trial Version First,"Definately download the trial version from Dantz's site first. I tried to get this to work with Windows XP Home edition. My DVD/CDRW drive was listed as supported on the Dantz site, but I had no end of problems. I spoke with their technical staff 3 times and followed their instructions and continued to have errors. Many hours lost. I gave up and chose another backup program."
1,Corrupted backup files,This software is poorly documented and has minimal user interface thereby setting up the potential for file corruption and fatal crashes. I have had no luck retrieving my files or uninstalling Retrospect from my Registry. The potential for fatal crashes makes this product risky.
1,"Oh, this was a lot of fun with XP",I deleted it in a flash. Crudely single-minded about instantly performing automatic tasks I did not want to perform.
1,Couldn't They Have Found Any Better Footage?,"This DVD was a major disappointment. Not only is it too short but the performances are pretty reserved and not real interesting. The original (and best) guitarist Henry Vestine is present only on the lip-synched ""On the Road Again"" where we see an apparently medicated Alan Wilson delivering lyrics with the style of a fourth-grader giving an oral report on the Pilgrims arriving in America. It is not representative of what I consider America's greatest blues boogie band.Perhaps they will dig up some better live footage of the band but in the meantime, for Canned Heat fans, the low price of this DVD is about the only reason for buying it."
4,Brilliant but short,"I always thought Alan Wilson was a genius, and seeing him play and sing on ""On the Road Again"" comforted that opinion. Alan is much more reserved on the other tracks (drugs?) but Bob Hite makes up with high energy. Short but a must have for Canned Heat fans.The other previews on this DVD are quite enjoyable as they dig out the best era performances for all the bands."
3,Good and a half,"Al Kooper produced Appaloosa when an A&R; big wig at Columbia in the late 1960s. This is well written folk with a cello.This is a good album, but if buying to get Kooper's usually big jazz sound, pause. There is one piece with a saprano sax, and another with the bold brass R&B; that was Kopper's signature for the era.But most songs here are quiet and subtle. Appaloosa takes time to grow on you. But it will if you enjoy what I described. This is not essential, but if you like Kooper and the experimentation that stamped rock during this era, this is an impressive pick."
3,quilts from aunt amy,"This book is not for beginners. I did not care for the fabric choices of the finished quilts pictured. As far as the constuction of the quilts, there are lots of small pieces, curved piecing, applique. A challenging book."
3,Inherited Sampler Quilt Remade,"The premise of the book - using blocks from an old family sampler quilt to make new quilts - is great. The new projects they created from the blocks are well done, with lovely updated colors that retain the feel of old quilts. An added bonus was the chicken blocks the authors included - a trademark of their quilt books."
5,"GREAT MOVIE STUNTS & THE MAKING OF ""RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK""","This video was amazing! The stunts were top draw, and the behind the scenes footage was class! I would recomend this vid to everyone as its entertaining, funny and more to the point educational! May I please make a point to George Lucas & Steven Spielberg. If you both have similar footage of the other two indy films could you please produce the same kind of videos? Or perhaps make a stunts and behind the scenes video of Indy 4!"
5,Think it can't happen in your town...,"I read this book in one sitting and it scared the hell out of me. I never thought I would see the towns of Chambersburg, Waynesboro and Greencastle in a nationally publized book but I did. You think it can't happen in your town...think again. The story of Debbie Sue Kline is one of heartbreak, cruelty and sadness. The pictures in the back also helped develop a more clear picture. Highly recommended book!"
3,Toes are cramped,"I LOVE Dansko. They are my favorite shoe. I don't wear anything else to work (since I am on my feet ALL day). I wanted to wear some heels since my new job and thought who better than Dansko? Well, I loved the look of the Remy the best and bought a pair at my friends shop. When I got them, I wore them around a little on my day off. The only problem with this shoe is that my toes literally get cramped. And I don't have wide feet. In fact, some shoes are too wide for me. Especially if they have been tried on too many times and have been stretched out or broken in. Other than that the arch is fine. But I couldn't get past the cramped toes. I didn't even know your toes could get cramped. Unfortuneatly, I do not wear them for more than an a couple of hours at a time. If it weren't for that, they would be the perfect heel!"
5,LOVE THIS MANGA!!!!,This manga is one of my all-time fave series! ^_^ its so intresting and unique and its all based on this ancient game from Asia called GO which is so much fun to play ^_^ i STRONGLY recomend this manga to all manga fans youll fall for the unique story and amazing drawings as well as the cool characters ^_^
4,English Grammar and Exercises I II III IV by L R H Chapman,These books are used in Sri Lanka and help the students to learn English Grammar in a big way as it is very simplified.
2,A different read,"This book by Carl Rollyson shows a tremendous amount of work in preparation and writing. The book to me, is a little confusing because it goes back and forth in time as it discusses various elements of Mailer's life. Mailer apparently is a very complex person, though a very gifted writer who has worked hard to present his craft to the public. There are so many aspects to the book and to Mailer's life that it was a little difficult for me to read and follow. There is a solid amount of work in the book so many will enjoy it. I took several days to think about how to handle this review because of the above difficulties for me.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Ways"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms"""
1,Author reviews own book?,"If I'm not mistaken, this is an amazon.com first -- an author posting a review of his own work. What gives? Has all decorum gone out the window?"
1,"Arrived damaged, no mounting hardware.","This is the second of these light fixtures that I have ordered. The metal of the fixtures is fairly flimsy and both of the fixtures arrived bent and beat up. I returned the first one and reordered. No luck, this one is probably more bent up than the first one. Unfortunately, I had to keep the second, as I needed to complete the bathroom refit, even temporarily. I managed to bend this thing into shape to get it to hang on the wall, but it's coming down as soon as I find a suitable replacement. Will not order Kichler fixtures again."
4,Looks and Works Great,Gives lots of non-florescent light in our bathroom and has a sleek design which complements most decor without being trendy. I hope that the brushed nickel finish will hold up to our moist climate and not tarnish like our previous chrome fixture did.
5,Drama at sea,"On a recent vacation to Virginia Beach I was introduced to both this wonderful little book and its author during a dramatic one-man show based on ""The Norwegian Lady..."" If you are interested at all in maritime history and the drama it entails, you will love this book. There are moments within that will bring you to tears, as the courageous captain tries to save his beloved wife, infant son ... and faithful crew ... while the ship, within sight of the shore goes down in a terrible storm off the coast of Virginia Beach ... all the time the citizens on land watching helplessly. This is a well-researched gem of a book, now updated and reprinted to include coverage of some of the yearly ceremonies held at the statue of the Norwegian Lady which faced the sister city across the Atlantic in Moss, Norway."
3,DeLillo's Least Effective Book,"During my rabid consumption of DeLillo's work two years ago, ""Players"" was the one bump on the road. It was the only one of his books that I could take or leave. It reads like a dry run for ""Mao II,"" another book that lacks the soul and wit that drive DeLillo's best work, ""White Noise,"" ""Libra"" and ""Underworld"" and his most underrated book, ""End Zone."" ""Players"" was perfectly fine, but leaves an empty feeling. My purpose isn't to condemn this book, only to urge new DeLillo readers not to start with it."
1,dull and boring,"I have read and greatly enjoyed Libra, White Noise, and Cosmopolis.I didn't like though The Falling Man, somehow because I thought it lacked any plot or compelling story. Sure, it's the aftermath of 9/11, and few people could probably write it better than De Lillo, but, the story was just flat and uninteresting.The same holds for Players. Sure, well written; but boring. I kept reading hoping it would lead somewhere. It doesn't. Don't waste your time."
4,Radical Politics and Radical Love,"Basically, this is the story of a couple that takes separate vacations. She goes to Maine with her friends, a gay couple, and we read about their interaction. Meanwhile, he is drawn into the political underground, where he becomes fascinated with some vague group's shadowy and violent tactics. DeLillo fans that have read ""Mao II"" will recognize this ""two-path"" structure. But this time, the juxtapositions of different family-member experiences didn't really resonate (at least with me) or seem to add up to much. Is this what he's communicating? ""It occurred to her that this was the secret life of their involvement. It had always been there, needing only this period of their extended proximity to reveal itself. Disloyalty, spitefulness, petulance."""
3,Good for travellers or correspondence.,"Albeit that there are not many dictionaries on the beautiful languages of Serbian and Croatian, this book is not complete. It occassionally does not distinguish between words that have variation in the two languages. Some words are out of date or not in current culture usage. But again, it is one of a very few resourses available on the language. It is a good reference, but not the last word on translation."
2,Does anyone truly speak Serbo-Croatian anymore?,"I am married to a native Serbian, and have been trying to learn Serbian over the past 14 years that I've known him. This book I thought would be a helpful resource, but it is not.1. The words are outdated2. The definitions are very short and simple without any usage examples, which can be confusing when a word has double meaning in english.3. The words are a mix of Serbian and Croatian without any indication of which is Serbian and which is Croatian.The third point was the biggest struggle for me because I was learning improper Serbian. This book is not useful at all, and I wish I could return it. Unfortunately, I cannot offer a better alternative because the Serbian language is just not that popular to get it on the Amazon sales list."
2,Rather a brief work.,I was asked to buy this for a relative. I was expecting it to be some big deal but was disappointed when I received it. It is quite a brief work and I am unsure of how useful it could be.
1,Had to get it fixed already,"This dishwasher came with my house and was new when I moved in 4 years ago. I have already had to have someone come out to fix it. I only run it about twice a week, so this was disappointing. It is now broken again. I think I will replace it instead of fixing it this time.I also do not like the knob to turn it on. You have to twist it past several other cycles to get it to the ""normal"" cycle and it clicks on and off while you do this. It's a little challenge to stop it at ""normal"" and not twist past. Buttons would be much better."
1,Look again....,This book is a reprint of a turn-of-the-century treatise and is of no use to anyone seeking information about the current laws in this area.
1,Blah!,"This is the worst book I have ever purchased in my life. It was not a book, but a booklet and the advice was irrelevant, and out of date. When I started substitute teaching, I was desparate for some advice on how to manage behavior in the classroom and I definitely did not find my answer here."
2,"Fair, Overpriced, Shorter Than Advertised!","A quick read, only 32 pages of text as opposed to the 50 stated on Amazon's page for the book. Too much pholosophy (""If you have identified your standards and values and have honed your style accordingly...."", too few concrete classroom management rubrics.In spite of the above, this book contains a few good ideas and approaches."
3,I'm in the process of reviewing this movie for the 2th time.,I'm in the process of reviewing this movie for the 2th time to see if I missed anything. I always watch the twice.ERW
3,not as good as the book,I felt the acting was poor and the story was repititive. It was good looking but ultimately boring. no more
1,no closed caption,"Closed caption was not available on a portion of the collection. Without it, I could not give a review. Since my hearing is impaired, watching this without the captions is difficult."
1,"Whatever it is, it's not John Galsworthy","I cannot understand why the producers of this new version of the mini-series chose to decimate the story, and to omit the beauty of John Galsworthy's language. Irene is not a brunette, and the actress who portrays her here simply does not have the eternal beauty that forms so much description (fully realized visually in the first version) from the novels. It is hard to see what the attraction is to her here. The story has been changed, as has the ending. But why? Is Galsworthy not good enough? What remains (or, rather, what is) is a relatively mundane soap opera - not bad, but who cares. Definitely, absolutely get the first version. Or, better yet, read the books."
5,Forsytes,"I was glad to find this DVD--it is quite the same as the books, and very enjoyable. I will watch it many times with pleasure."
5,Best Earplugs I Have Ever Purchased,"I have used many different brands of earplugs as I am a light sleeper and often have had no choice if I wanted to get any decent amount of sleep. These earplugs are hands down the best on the market. I hear nothing and for me they are very comfortable to sleep with all night.I do not twist them in or out. I simply grab my ear with the opposing hand, reaching from behind my head and tug on my ear to open more and push in the plug with the other hand and do the same in reverse to remove. The cord is also great as anyone who is a frequent user of earplugs know they can come up missing very easily. Still using a pair that were purchased well over a year and a half ago!If you try these you definitely will not be disappointed. If you are still worried about the minimal amount of noise that does get through, you need to sleep in a vacuum chamber."
2,waste of $2,"I bought these after using the molding waxy ones thinking that the plugs provided a better seal - wrong! Plugs are comfortable, but the amount of noise blocked is minimal at best. I would try something else, but do note that most people find the right ear plugs through trial and error"
4,They work...,"I bought these ear plugs for studying purposes and they certainly perform well for typing, reading and writing in an area with low to moderate noise. They will not block out a normal conversation a few feet away though. Right now I am in a study room and I can hear nothing at all- the perfect environment to work in for me! Although these ear plugs are easy to insert they do hurt my ears. I wish that there were a smaller version of these ear plugs available. I can feel them and the cord makes a sound- but they still feel better than foam ear plugs and are much easier to clean and reuse."
2,Not for sleeping,"I bought these to use while sleeping to block out noisy, stomping upstairs neighbors. Sadly, these did not work for me. I could never get these in my ears comfortably and as I laid on the pillow the tiny ""handle bars"" on these ear plugs would catch on the pillow and break the seal to let sound in.I do think these ear plugs would work for day use, however, they just don't work for sleeping if you move at all in your sleep."
5,The best war primer known to modern man,"Angelo Codevilla introduced me to the worlds of war in the late 1980's and later to intelligence in the ealry 1990's, leading partly to my career.This book is what a modern Clauswhitz would write. Speaking in plain english on diverse subjects, he collects the type of thinking necessary to war in one book. I give this book (which is hard to find, but I managed) to every student of modern affairs.It is hard to find the correct praise to lavish on this book without gushing. It is simply the best book of a primer on war that exists anywhere. More than introducing the student to war, it introduces him to thinking in war's pragmatic thought patterns- to the necessity that war demands.Better, Codevilla uses his talent in context of historical necessity, drawing carefully from a bevy of beautifully chosen historical people and sitations.You can do no better on the subject. Start thinking about war with War."
4,When is Horace coming out with the new album?,After hearing this album I figured that he'd have at least 3-5 albums out by now ! hopefully he'll be returning because this was definiteley bedroom material.
3,"Not that great an album, but worth it alone for ""Taste Your Love""","There were lots of singers like him, and many of them had better albums to brag about, but this is still worth getting for his one big hit ""Taste Your Love"" a dreamy, if somewhat unrestrained sexcapade.Note: Although this album was released in 1996, ""Taste Your Love"" was actually getting radio airplay as early as October of 1994."
1,Same thing over again - DO NOT BUY,"Individual did it again - just added a few things to the same product. This product does not warrant the price they are asking. You can buy any of the earlier versions for a lot less and get the same instruction. Individual is careless with their design and product satisfaction. If you don't like the product they will not refund your money in fact they will not even listen to your call, if you can get through to them they will just offer to send you another one of their ... products. I think I have gone through all of their products and am just as disatisfied as when I started. Take it from me - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!"
2,Use with caution,"It's not a bad program. It seems to have good tools to teach one to type. However, it doesn't seem to like Windows Me or Windows 98. Installation seemed to go ok but I received run time errors when starting the program. After reinstalling, the program worked but errors still came up when accessing certain modules. The company's tech support were not very helpful and they wouldn't even consider a refund. They said they are working this issue but nothing's been heard from them yet. The software works on a friend's Windows 95 computer but I'd like to use it on mine. So far, I'm not pleased."
1,Save your money!,"I wish I would have read these reviews first. I just bought the program yesterday (at Office Depot) and took it home to install it. I couldn't even install the thing! It kept telling me it needed Ole files that other programs were running and would need to restart the computer before it could install. After several reboots, and making sure absolutley no other programs were running, it still wouldn't load. I have Windows ME on my system. I then tried to install it on my kids computer which uses Windows 95. Same problem. So I called technical support, at which point I was put on ignore for about 15 minutes (even though I was 1st in the que). When a human finally got on the phone he told me it was a software conflict (duh!), and they would send me a new disc. How is that going to help unless they have a new disc with bug fixes on it? Save your money, it's not worth the aggravation! I'll see if Office depot will be kind enough to give me a refund."
1,NOT WINDOWS NT COMPATABLE,"need i say more. despite the fact that the description says it will work with NT, this will create problems on your NT machine unlike any you have experienced before. i am on my second day of trying to get out of this hole that i seem to have gotten myself into. i can boot the computer but it will not run any of my programs.tech support for the software is horrible. i dialed the tech support number for 2 hours before i was able to talk to anyone. they were absolutely no help."
3,Skin of It's Teeth Does it Get A 3,"The film really has no plot, no biggie though, a lot of filmsdon't. The comedy is extremely dry and hardly funny. The nude scenes that are shown every twenty minutes are top notch at times. buy it for that I guess. The theme is a stressed out girl who's house sitting her uncle's house. Rent this first because you'll either want to see it once or every other day. You might want to fast forward through some scenes."
4,HardCore Trance,"This CD is the mother of all trance. If you want a perfect sample of what the trance is all about, TranzWorld series is the thing to have. Well, I am more a melodic and vocal trance fan, than a hardcore, pure, trance. However, even though most of the tracks are pretty heavy, this CD offers a variety of different styles, including some flowing melody. My favorite track is track four. *Once thing I must say, after trying to buy four cd's in the store, and ordering one cd on-line, it is clear that TranzWolrd 7 has a bug. Track 11 between 4:02 and 4:08 has a pause, that should not be there.*"
1,Not compatible with PAL ?,"While I live in Australia, I travel to the US regularly. In the US the unit works fine with the NTSC TV standard. When I switch it over to PAL-BG using the supplied software (in Europe or Australia) it does not work at all. I get a black and white image and just noise for sound. There are XP drivers on the AverMedia web site by the way, I downloaded and installed them and they work find on my NEC laptop which came with Windows XP home installed.I sent email to the AverMedia support site, but so far I haven't got any response."
3,"Interesting and worthwhile, but with some flaws","H.W. Lewis makes several interesting points, but I was somewhat disappointed that he also makes a few, relatively blatant, mathematical errors. (They are not too obvious, unless you are very sharp.) He also writes with a strong political slant that seems to lack some balance between all sides of an issue, and makes premature assumptions and judgements. A final pet peeve: he refuses to write in the first person, opting for ""this author"" vice ""I"", or evoking the royal ""we"". I found that quite distracting and unnatural."
4,Interesting point of view,I thought this was an interesting book to read. Unique topic and discussion. Made me think.
3,Good book on quantitative decisions.,"Excellent non-mathematical book about probability and decision making. Combine it with a bit of logical thinking and you'll never make another bad decision. Well, that might be stretching it. Still, though, Lewis has written a very readable book about good thinking and making decisions. He works through several different kinds of questions and explains why one decision is better than another. The book primary deals with decisions with a mathematical component - gaming, voting, statistics - and not with ethical or moral kinds of questions but the good thinking skills learned can be used in any context."
3,Fun info and recipes,This book was full of fun facts about what Jane Austen would've been eating and drinking! It was just fabulous. I even attempted one of the recipes: Modern Bath Cakes! They were super yummy. I would really like to get my own copy and try a few more of the recipes. This is a fun read for those who enjoy Jane Austen and the Regency era.
4,I'm ready to sit down and have a cup of tea!,"Fun and interesting, loaded with anecdotes and quotes from family and contemporaries, Tea With Jane Austen is truly a valuable asset to anyone's Jane collection! Jane herself made the tea for her family, so you cannot ignore this addition to the her ""lore"" and still be a true Janeite! Need I say more?Linore Rose BurkardAuthor, Before the Season Ends,An ""Austenesque"" Regency Romance[...]"
4,"Austen and Tea, What Could Be Better?",I collect books on tea and this was a must with my fondness for Jane Austen and tea.
4,Love and Courage.,"This book was purchased for my Kindele from Amazon. Worrying about the unknown sends Heather to a seminar for information about her disease. What she finds out and who she meets there will change her life forever. Will it be for better or worse? This is a very well written ,exciting book and I highly recommend it for anyone. I could not put it down. Read it in 2 evenings. Mimi6"
3,It was a really weak story line...,"I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Page after page of detailed sex is boring, especially when it was so predictable."
3,Straight from the Heart Barbara Delinsky,"The story plot is somewhat cut and paste. Events after the hiking trip are weak, not very likely, as for example the highjacking of the plane..Most of all, I enjoyed Barbara's ability to articulate the thoughts and feelings of her main characters. She poignantly describes the ""not so traditional"" feelings of the ""male"" character. She does not discriminate when it comes to feelings."
4,Straight from the Heart,Loved it. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the re releases. Love Delinsky and cannot put her books down!
3,Not the same as the smaller size,Seems like is has mineral oil in it. It's like a moisturizing body spray. This consistency is not the same as the smaller bottle.
1,Not as i expected.,I was hoping for a scent similar to my detergent or fabric softener. This reminds me of my mom's perfume which is a gardenia scent but mixed with a citrus tone. Not to my liking whatsoever.
1,be VERY careful,"i purchased this cd and it turned out to NOT be the original herbie mann cd. it was a recording burned from the lp that sounds like it had first been made using a poor cassette recorder. it sounded like it was recorded in a closet with the door closed! it also included ALL the pops and scratches from the album. even several skips and jarring needle resets. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED! i want to make clear that the cd i am reviewing is the one with the babbling brook on the cover. unless i got a freak, awful, rip-off version, the other reviewers must be referring to the cd with the picture of herbie on the front. amazon doesn't distinguish between them when you write a review. they print all reviews for both versions that they offer"
5,"Best of Mickey's ""live"" recordings.","I can only imagine the reason no one else has reviewed this album to date is due to the fact that all of the songs on it were previously released. And I must admit that that fact kept me from purchasing it for some time. Disappointed for the most part with ""Nights When I Am Sane"", which offered up 4 new songs (at the time) and in my opinion the best ""cover/booklet"" of any of the Newbury packages (yet seemed like Mickey was dealing with some demons) there didn't appear to be much reason to acquire ""Live In England"". But opening with ""Angeline"", one of my all-time favorite Newbury songs (but, then, what isn't)showed how beautiful a performance this collection was to be. And to top it all off, the ending of ""San Francisco Mabel Joy"" is just as powerful as the Choir of Angels on ""Looks Like Rain"". To think that it's only one voice. Highly recommended, but I can say the same for every album by Mickey Newbury."
4,WWE: Royal Rumble The Complete Anthology,I'm really glad that I got this.It was fun watching some of the old matches and seeing some of the old wrestlers.I see people saying that the sound is bad but I didn't have any problems hearing it.The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars is the packaging box that it comes in is bad like others have said on here.This is a must buy if you are like me you like pro wrestling and the royal rumble match is your favorite match.
1,Just Wondering....,For anyone who bought the wrestlemania anthology set....i was wondering if any of you guys sets were scratched like mine? The disc that attached to the top of the boxset was dislodged and when i played it and when it got to the kurt angle and hbk match the disc would stop and i couldn't watch it.....i haven't had a chance to watch the other disc yet but they appear to have light scratches and marks on them as well....i hate flipsided disc....and is this complete anthology gonna be limited edition like the wrestlemania complete anthology was? I know you can still buy the wm's in volumes but the complete anthology boxset was limited edition
3,Royal Rumble,"While im a huge wrestling fan, I have yet to buy this product. Ive seen every Royal Rumble and they are hit or miss. The 1996 Royal Rumble was probably the worst Rumble and the one with Steiner-Triple H was terriable as well. I'd buy this set if they came in seperate packages like the WrestleMaina ones did."
5,JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THEN THE WRESTLEMANIA BOX SET,THIS BOX SET WAS AMAZING AND I ENJOYED IT JUST AS MUCH AS THE WRESTLEMANIA BOX SET. I CANT WAIT TILL THEY RELEASE A SUMMERSLAM AND SURVIVOR SERIES BOX SET.
3,Royal Rumble Box,"Wrestling fans, this is a must have. The content inside is surperb. The box it comes in is CRAP! Mine arrived already spilt and ripped before I even opened. I contacted Amazon about this and they agreed to replace, however they replaced with a normal plastic dvd case which holds 1 dvd. Gutted!!! Whoever designed this set needs to be shot. They should've kept the design of the Wrestlemania box. Aside from that, watching all the rumbles is cool! Its just the box it comes in which lets this down."
3,Packaging really ruins the set,"Hi everyone, the packaging is these two heavy boxes that are attached together with this flimsy piece of printed paper that if you open the box more than 4 times the crease in it will eventually rip in half so you now have two box sets instead of one. The videos are really great but the packaging really sucks. If they would just put the sets in a good box it would be great. I probably wouldn't buy another wwe set if it comes in the same kind of box. thanks"
3,"5 Star Video Quality, 1 Star for the package...","...thus the 3 star review. While the video quality is wonderful, the outer ""book"" packaging began to split along the edges after the first time I opened the set. (I've been buying DVDs and DVD sets for nearly 10 years, so I know a thing or two about being careful.)Since NO retailer accepts returns on open DVD media, I have been forced to patch the set with packaging tape. Yep - I had to use TAPE on a DVD set with an SRP of $270. Thankfully, I managed to pay about 1/2 that, plus S/H and tax. Still sucks, though, that I had to do that."
4,4 Stars as far as the packaging is concerned...,"I was very surprised when receiving my box set. The packaging was like a fold out book and that in itself held the box sets with a ribbon to pull out four booklets which held the dvd's. The booklets contained all dvd's which not one of them were dislodged surprisingly, because shipping the item could do that.The dvd's were easy to take out without having to bend the dvd's. If you bought recent WWE dvd's such as the WWE Championship Legacy or the Ultimate Hulk Hogan anthology dvd, the setup in the booklet was exactly the same as these, plastic pages where you can turn, like a book. The design on the boxset is great. WWE outdid themselves with this one, probably seeing the error of their ways with the Wrestlemania Anthology. As far as watching the set, I have not gotten to it. Anticipating til then."
4,Can't Wait!!!,"I'm really looking forward to this dvd release. I just hope if they do a four volume, please release 2000-2005 or 6 as volume 4. So I just have to buy the first three volumes."
5,CMON IT'S THE ROYAL RUMBLE BABY!!!!!!,What do you expect from the uniquest paper-view ever created. There is the royal rumble from 2004 to the past royal rumble which was 2008's. I mean if your new to this stuff get the first one but if you know all about get the whole set because it is entertaining baby!!!!
3,Should be pretty good.,if you can get past the horrible looking blurs & music altering. some peoples eyes are senitive to the blurring. the pricing for this set is pretty bad just like the wrestlemania anthology but that was expected as usual. anyway heres to hoping for an otherwise great box set. hopefully in the near future we can get a great 3-5 dvd set for kane & the second enstallment of the wwe anthology cd series.
4,hopful,I hope they dont change half the theme music like they did for wrestlemania. Thats a bunch of bull that they claimed they didnt have the rights to thier own songs they produced
5,THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE,"This is truly a dream come true , I have been wondering when the wwe would finally create a treasure like this , I give it five stars because I have seen every royal rumble to date. I am going to pre order this because a piece of history like this may not last long."
1,To answer a question that has been asked already,"Although I have not bought this set, my reason being because I have several of them already in pre-lawsuit un-edited form, I must address a question that some have already asked. I just got off the phone with a customer service rep, and after being put on hold, he confirmed that this box set will be the only way they will be available. they are not doing individual Volumes like the Wrestlemania Anthology. I too was only interested in the first 5 rumbles, and would have bought a 'Volume one' if it was available. Ohwell, now I can just hope the sets become door stops for the retail stores, and they mark them down substantially."
3,Haven't gotten into it in depth.,I haven't gotten into it yet so can't give an informed review. It appears to provide a lot of useful information that should be of value and also expand the enjoyment of my anticipated trip with a lot of historical and natural history details.
3,Duplication,"All of the stories in this book can be found in the ""GolfOmnibus"" along with several more. The ""Golf Omnibus"" in my opinion is a much better bargain."
1,Movies about bands way past their prime...,"Doesn't make sense... Why make a documentary about a band's album 20 years after the album came out? What new insights into the production of the album do we hope (or care) to gain? U2 has sucked since Joshua Tree. I don't want to revisit something that only reminds me that they've sucked for a long time now. In 20 more years, maybe they can play the Super Bowl, like Madonna or the Who."
5,Great documentary!,"What a treat it is to revisit the making of the Achtung Baby album by listening to U2 themselves talking about their experiences and what went into creating that amazing record! The best parts of the film, though, are seeing Bono and The Edge performing solo renditions of So Cruel and Love is Blindness. While they don't go into depth about every single song on the album, the documentary was so well done in every other respect that this makes up for it. If you love U2, you'll enjoy this."
5,this is a fantastic album,"awww man i never heard this album from them before man i just got to say they snapped on that album for some simple reason because they didnt want to be known for just the songs if you dont know me by now,wake up everybody and bad luck i mean come on now they wanted to let people know that they had other songs ya dig and thats fa' sho...."
5,When Clay Sings,"This is a cross-curricular book for language, writing, cultural studies, history, art...Somewhere in moving classrooms, I lost my Byrd Baylor collection. So I bought this book for myself. For my own pleasure."
1,Poor quality,"After having a bad experience with the cheaper kid punching bag, I decided to spend the extra money on the Everlast brand. That was just as bad. I have a 3 year old that damaged it enough for the water to come busting out and making a huge mess on the floor. I would not recommend this product for anyone with a child over 1yrs., it won't last."
1,very poor quality,"had a leak first time it was inflated. I immediately used the included patch kit to fix it which held up for about 2 weeks. all from the abuse of just a 4 year old, also when it was working, I found it to be flimsy and very slow in up-righting itself. I do not recommend this product at all."
1,Didn't last a day,"I purchased this for my six year old son for Christmas. I was nervous when I read that it required water in the base but figured since it was an Everlast product, they were careful to think of the possiblities and make it reasonably tear proof. It was a big hit all day until the water filled bottom burst that same evening all over the carpet (it holds more water than you would think). I did not want to repair the rip and add more water just to see if it would do it again, so filled it with beans (thinking I likewise did not want sand all over the house and beans would be the least of the three evils). This product needs the fluidity of water to function properly. From my experience, this is a very poor choice for a child and is really a bummer when the main Christmas gift you got your kid doesn't even make it through Christmas day."
5,hazyboi,"Bought it for my 6 year old to practice her karate, but we all use it from time to time. Doesn't look like it will hold up on initial inspection, but its been drug around, jumped on, hit and kicked a lot and it hasn't leaked air or water yet."
3,"fun toy, but not very durable","We purchased this for our two boys (ages 7 and 11). They like it a lot. They use it for punching and kicking (they both take karate). The only problem with it is that the base where you fill in the water has started to leak (after 2 days). It apparently comes with a repair kit, which should have told us something about its durability I guess! We have yet to see if the repair will hold or not..."
2,disappointed,"I have an 8 year old boy who begged for a punching bag for Christmas.He is not a rough boy, and does not play too ""hard"" with his toys.The base of this bag got a hole in it, so it renders the bag useless.Unfortunately I do not think it is durable enough for normal play as intended."
1,"Fun, for a few hours...","My wife bought my teenage sun this item to box train with. My sun was hoping for a regular punching bag, but since we live in an apartment, we can't hang one. One thing; it's not easy to set up, at all. It takes a ton of pumping. When we got it totally inflated, he started to practice on it. It worked alright - bumping back and forth; but when it came time for the second day of training, when he started to attack it, a small hole appeared, which leaked water. We then attempted to fill it was the substance provided, incase of said malfunction. When we finish, my sun gave it a test punch and dozens of holes appeared, squirting water aflow. The only thing this piece of garbage was good for now was the city dump. Unless your child is at the age of 10 or less, you really want to consider buying him or her a regular sized punching bag; or signing him or her up for the local gym."
3,"Slowly leaks water, but still works","I got this for my 3 year old to play with while I am using my heavy bag. Off the bat the lowest section that holds water leaked very slowly. (5 minutes in there was a slight dampness on the kitchen floor, 30 min it it was starting to puddle) I set up the bag in the kitchen to start off in fear of exactly what happened and it doesnt hold water well enough to leave filled on its own. (air is set to 69 so its not condensation) I plan on filling the lower section with sand and then adding a small amount of water to dampen it for added weight which should solve that issue... Other than that my kid loves it so far and hopefully it will last him long enough until I find a better suited product.As a side note the pump it comes with is worthless. I wasted about 5 minutes using it because my kid liked it and wanted to ""help"". The anticipation got to him though and I was able to convince him that my electric pump would let him play with it a lot sooner."
3,Good value for money,"I bought this for my 4+ year old son and he enjoys punching on this, it get's used every day. I am happy too as I do not get those punches on me now. The pump that comes with it is not very useful, you will be tired before you get halfway. I used the electric pump so no problem.. The air in the base does leak so I have to put air(in the base) on a daily basis, else it would not stand up straight.For the price, it's a good buy."
2,Lasted 2 weeks,"I gave this item 2 stars as it was enjoyable for my kids to use, but after 2 weeks the bottom came apart at a seam, and leaked water everywhere"
4,punching bag,arrived as advertised on time. a big hit with my 4.5 yr old. seems to holding up well to the pummeling.
4,Solid Item,"Once the bag is filled it works well. The pump that comes with it isn't any good I ended up blowing it up using my mouth, but even then it is small enough that it didn't take long to fill. Bag doesn't fall down, good for kids (since its youth) or just for fun, wouldn't recommend for an actual boxer."
5,youth inflatable training bag,Of course our kid loves UFC its the biggest thing in mixed martial arts sports :D This is an awesome training aid for children learning mixed martial arts. Bag is a little messy to fill with water if your not paying attention but its perfect for them to practice punches and kicks on. so glad that we got this he's improving every day.
2,LEAKY,I too had similar leak issues on the base where the water sits. I don't think this bag can handle the punishment. I had to patch 2 leaks so far.
1,Leaked water after first use.,This product is no better than filling a balloon full of air. This thing got a hole almost immediately and it was NOT repairable. The hole is right on a seam and the water leaked all over our carpet. My kid was only punching the thing when it sprung this leak. Piece of junk!
1,Don't waste your money,"We bought this for my 4 year old son as a Christmas present thinking it would be a great way to get out some of that boy energy. After an our of blowing the top part of bag up, we attempted to put water in the bottom part (before we blew up the bottom half of the bag). It was messy and the plug to keep the water in kept opening so we had water all over our floor. When we finally got the plug on tight (or so we thought), the bag wouldn't stand up so my husband and I held it while my son punched the bag. The water came out again. Worthless and not worth the money. My son was so disappointed because he was so excited about punching the bag with his Hulk Hands."
5,Good book,It is a good book for landlord. But some bad tenant can move the case from State to Federal court and even file bankruptcy to delay sheriff eviction. I met one that file fee waiver and illegally cause delay.
4,"Good, if a bit overly dark","Taking a trip into gothic Techno, Joachim Witt's 1998 effort ""Bayreuth Eins"" provides an interesting starting point. The most-played song upon this album is the fourth track, ""Die Flut"" (The Flood), sung with Peter Heppner (the music video, I assure you, is suitably bizarre).The musical quality is so overpoweringly dark, however, that very many of Witt's motifs are lost. As an interesting, driving set of music, this CD fills the bill. For a better look stylistically at Witt, and what his music is about, try the followup album to this, the 2000 release of ""Bayreuth Zwei""."
3,Two For Brazil Plays the Standards,"Excellent saxophone and guitar music, but every track is mostly vocals which I think detracts from the enjoyment of the album."
5,Stunning insight into how Stalin's USSR really worked,"Anyone who wants to know how the economy of Stalin's USSR really worked has to read this book. Forget the talk of five-year plans, the controlled economy, Stakhanovites and anything which might suggest the economy ran on organised lines. Witkin spells out with fascinating clarity the extraordinary extent to which anarchy ruled and is especially good on the back-stabbing venal managers who were so keen to promote their own interests that they did huge damage to the enterprises where they worked. The flowery passages on Witkin's unhappy love life are less interesting but do not really detract from the power of the work as a whole. Michael Gelb deserves a reward for uncovering such a crucial memoir."
2,2 stars for the 2 songs i liked on the booty cd,...there are only 2 good songs on it to me and thats:baby momma & just a baby boy other than that blah...
4,Hip Hop Happening!!!!,I love this soundtrack!! 'Just A Baby Boy' is another brilliant tune from Snoop Dogg!! The film is great too!! (girls you'll love Tyrese- He is FINE!!!
4,Good Disc!,"Phat jams by snoop, marvin gaye, etc...worth buying! Great background song as heard in track 1."
3,works good,"this sharpens great I gave it 3 stars because the stones suck that come with it, and i think that the shaft which the arbour sticks into is a little flimsy. But it does do what it needs to"
4,Useful,This product is very useful when out cutting and It's time to sharpen. Reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the locking pin fell out and got lost in the woods. It's the pin that keeps the shaft from turning when changing the sharpening bit. Other than that it is quite handy and the price was right. Happy sawing!
2,Chain saw sharpener,Over all not bad for the price but when you want to change the grinding wheel it is very hard to keep the wheel from spinning. Fortunatly you don't have to change the grinding wheel all that often.
3,Lightweight documentary,"First, know that this is a 45 minute documentary; at $20 or more, it's a rip-off. This is a travelogue oriented presentation, and although it's well photographed, the information is presented in a sort of stream-of-consciousness manner -- it jumps around all over the place, and then goes back to things that you thought had already been covered...including repetition of several shots. There are two reasons to recommend it. Reason 1: if you want a souvenir of your visit to Hearst Castle, this is certainly better than any home video you can take yourself. Reason 2: if you've never been there, and don't know much about it, it does serve as a decent, although scattered, introduction. Of course, nothing can compare with actually going there, and that's what I recommend most of all!"
1,For tv ok but nothing else dont work for my stuff,"After purchasing 3 different universal remotes the tech dept at RCA told me I need this model to operate audio rec and cd player, But it didnt work and no codes available. Upon calling back they informed me they cannot guarentee it will work with everything. Bought a $3.00 Zenith remote that works great. RCA stinks last thing from them i will buy, im out for 3 remotes and all the shipping and headaches having their experts teach me how to program a remote (this can be done by a monkey)"
5,A Great Remote for the price,"This is actually my second remote of this model type. I had to buy a second one because my parrot ate all the buttons off the old one. It runs all my devices flawlessly, including my old Zenith TV that is over 16 years old. It's easy to program and operate. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone in the market for a new multifunction remote."
2,Not much fun!,"My son loves marbles, so I thought this would be a fun game for him...when it arrived, it was broken apart and loose in the package (like it had already been opened and re-packaged). When he tries to play with it, the base comes off at one end and everything slides off of the pole holding it together. He gets frustrated and has basically just decided to play with the bag of marbles that came with it. I would have just saved my money and bought some loose marbles if I had known."
2,Bash-A-Burglar-Breaks-A-Bunch,"I bought this for my 6 year old nephew for him to be able to work on his marble shooting skills. Alas, it was broken in the box. I thought a little wood glue would take care of the problem, but then the other side broke when placed gently on the floor. The only thing nice about this toy is getting the marbles and being able to hone your marble skills with them - no bells, no whistles. My suggestion - buy a bag/box of marbles and have fun playing with them without the addition of this toy."
4,A Must for Church Fans,"This compilation of music videos chronicles the band's career from their first release through the ""Gold Afternoon Fix"" lp. As Kilbey jokes up front, the band is not exactly a pioneer in the video industry, but the performances are worth watching for the die-hard fans. Most notable on this collection is the film footage between songs, which captures the band on the road and in and about the studio. It shows their silly sense of humor, which only occasionally creeps out in their music. The videos appear on this tape in order, and it is interesting to view Marty's growth as a guitarist - beginning as basically a rhythm backup to Peter and ending up as a true second lead. Definitely worth the price for fans!"
2,A relic in an internet world,"This is a cash-in-on-a-franchise book, apparently written by Daniel Cohen in between his various Bigfoot/UFO/Loch Ness endeavors. Like those books, this one is targeted to children from preteen to early teens.In clear, unadorned prose, each chapter gives a blow-by-blow description of at least one episode from the original Star Trek television show. The episodes are grouped by the type of monster that appears in them ""Mind Benders,"" ""Shape Shifters,"" and ""Energy Creatures,"" are a few examples.The book also features an index for reference, and some black and white photos from the series.The book invites a funny observation that the categories of monsters were extremely limited by budgetary constraints.As a reference, the book has ceased to be useful in the slightest, as online resources are both more comprehensive and easier to use.An avid collector might want to own the book as memorabilia, but there will be very little practical reason to take it down from the shelf."
3,"A good book, but...","I have the first edition book from 1986, maybe the book changed since. The photos are black and white, not very useful ! We can't really agree with his identification of birds : colors are essential to identify a bird !It is the only mistake, but a very bad one."
4,My View on Mobile Application Principles,"Please excuse English. This is a very good book for learning mobile applications in US and Europe. Also, a lot of good new things on UML and XML. But, I would have liked to see more on the Japanese Mobile development. I think this is good as a text book in class room or reference. I would like to have more introductions to UML than 1 chapter. The UML is more advanced in this book. Also lot of good location and voice informations."
5,Jensen MOD 10-50 sounds amazing!,I installed this speaker in my 30 year old (orange) Roland Cube 40 and it has been transformed. Sounds a lot like a vintage VOX amp. Plus it goes from clean to overdrive beautifully even without pedals. Amazing value at $40 bucks. Can't wait to play it at a live gig!
2,"well,","The 'In Action"" series fills a special niche for the aviation enthusiast. They represent an affordable, if basic look at an aircraft with good illustrations and a good coverage of development and model designations.This is usually 'held together' with an accompanying narrative of the aircraft in operational use. Not so this one. Reference to its operational use in the 1970s is almost absent. ODS gets a one page montage, belying its 1991 publication date. That was twenty years ago.A fine presentation showing its age."
3,Back to music...,"Not bad to listen to while you're getting dressed to go out on the town to ""boogie down""!"
1,terrible,"We bought 2 of these RC cars, and both were defective. Within 24 hours of purchase neither was working. When the say ""remove batteries"", they mean it. The cars that do work will drain the batteries in about 6 hours if not removed after each use."
2,a disappointment,"this is a total disappointment. it lacks the expressive maturity that we have come to expect and wastes everyone's time. although there are no ""wrong"" notes it is just absolutely boring to listen to"
5,Cher has done it again,"This is a great DVD. Has some of the same songs as from her farewell tour but several other that aren't. Love it and added it to ny Cher library of DVD,s"
2,The Spectacular in Concert,"THE SPECTACULAR CHERAs a fifty-six-year old, I grew up when Sono and Cher began their career. I was always fascinated by Cher's voice abd costumes because I knew that she had a sheer body-suit under her clothing; therefore, I was not shocked. When she walked out on the stage in the black suit with the hose held up by a guitar belt, I was very displeased when I realized that she was necked on the rear. For me this ruined the entire DVD. This definately lowered my ratings of her as a fantastic singer. She has been a role model for many people who grew up with Cher from the beginning of her career. This certainly lowered my respect for her."
5,The Best Freestyle Album,This is the best freestyle album you will ever come across!!!! Trinere brings down the house everytime her music is played.
5,Works wonders,"Easy on and easy off, no kidding. You might hesitate because it is a cleaner wax and maybe not easy to work with. Nothing further from the truth. I did my truck and I did the hood of my gf's 2001 Intrepid. I was curious to see how it'd work on paint that old. Well, it went on just as easy and came off just as easy too!Not only that, on the rest of her car you can see the leaves in the reflection of the paint but on the hood where I used PC you can see that they are green leaves. hehe. I'm gonna do a coat ofLiquid Glass LG100 Polish 16 oz.on her car too.Darin"
5,Liquid Glass Pre-Cleaner,"I've been using Liquid Glass Pre-Cleaner and Finishing Polish for a number of years. Recently a neighbor ""re-inherited"" an old Subaru Legacy that used to be red in color. The previously red finish was now pink with large white splotches. Because my neighbor has been good to me, I asked him for the keys to the Subaru and drove it to my house. Because the finish was so oxidized, I repeatedly used the Pre-Cleaner until my polishing towel no longer had any pink color on it. Then I finished off with a coat of Liquid Glass Finishing Polish and let it bake in the sun for an afternoon. Several days later I added a second coat. I only wish I could add some before and after photos to this review. I also wish I could post a photo of my neighbor's face as I drove his gleaming red Subaru back onto his driveway. It looked as good as it did the day he bought it new!"
5,Great Product from Amazon,"This product is better than described it is easy to use and the results are even better. I would highly reccomend this product to anyone,especially a friend. The product re3moves nearly any poluktant from the finisa and the results is a brilliant shine ready for what ever protectant you choose. I personally reccomend Liquid G;ass protectant."
1,Logomedia Japanese Translator,"Don't waste your money -- despite what it says, this program is NOT compatible with Windows 98, and it doesn't seem to like Windows 2000 much either.It took three re-installations to even get it to take, and then it proceeded to complain that it couldn't find this or that component, even though they were installed. And the un-installation program is a joke -- all it did was remove three of the four icons and a few registry keys. It left all the files in place, and one start-up component still running.I'll pass on this and look for another program."
1,Waste of Money!!,This software is a fake. It translates English into something which is definitely not Japanese. The J-E translation is also totally screwball...Don't waste your time and money.
3,Mormon Quad Bible,It was used but it was also falling apart. Not worth what I paid for. Sorry but that is what I feel.
5,Glad it blew my way!,The children in my classroom love this book. It teaches many skills and is a fun read as well. I highly reccomend it :)
4,"The wind is ""magic""","We checked this book out from a local library over a year ago, and it's one my daughter (age 3) has asked for repeatedly - yet the library couldn't locate it again. She told everyone the wind blew the wind book away. Well, it finally ""landed"" on our doorstep and she continued to look for all of the other items that the wind takes in the book - as if they could be in our yard. We think the illustrations are funny becuase it's amazing that all of the people in the book who wear hats have really flat heads - so the hats don't stay on! This picture book puts a fun spin on the wind and turns a windy day into an adventure."
3,CRITICAL THINKING 101!,"If one is about the business of seeking justice and correctness in life, particularly in america, then this author's book is worth the price and time to read. The author puts regurgitates and puts forth images and currently presented societal evidence of what can be considered world history by europeanized standards. While there is the current trend to put forth the alternative view of this amalgam called american history and all the people's contribution, the question of personal responsibility, solutions to the mess that was created and next steps has been missing. This author does a competent job in letting the reader do the critical thinking necessary to further prove and or dispute what is known about who's who and what's what in regards to history. Be prepared to deal with some unhealed wounds."
4,English Country Dances,"Just about perfect for background during ""A Christmas Carol."" The only thing better would have been live musicians."
3,Ok cd,Not quite what I had in mind......I was expecting a cd with folk type of songs...Jane Austen era.
3,"If you like Sci Fi, then you will like this one","This is what one might consider as a Sci Fi ""B""-movie, but not a bad one, by any means. There are plenty of movies out there with larger budgets, more famous actors/actresses, better locations and equipment, and much worse plotlines. This movie demonstrates original thinking and a few new twists. Its true, there are no famous actors nor actresses here ... and the ending is a little weak, but the cast members look good and give above average performances. I also thought the movie had some fairly decent special effects. I enjoyed it and I believe any REAL Sci Fi nut would too.According to Mt Bumba, it seems we should just throw out objective criticism and replace it with personal feelings. This doesn't help anyone, dude."
5,the label,"Midnight Express Volume 2 is the latest installment in this acclaimed series showcasing the most dancefloor friendly moments from the Guidance Recording's catalog. The program and the mix come courtesy of up and coming Chicago DJ and Guidance sound engineer Tobias Berblinger. Tobias' patented blend of sultry ""Gold Coast"" house music has won him Saturday night residencies at legendary Windy City nite spots Zentra and The Ruby Slipper, and established him as one to watch out for on the Global DJ circuit. On Midnight Express, Tobias takes the listener on an uplifting, feel good journey into the deep soulful house sounds that have become the Guidance trademark. Enjoy the Ride!"
2,Yawwwwn...,"I'm sorry to say the Midnight Express series has nothing that would even allow me to listen to these straight through. For a more interesting listen mixed by a real dj, check out DJ Spinna's ""Raiding The Crates""- he does the Guidance catalog some good. and to the Guidance staff: excellent job on the A&R ing, but get real Dj's to mix your sound not some fat dude w/ a goatee and pony tail sitting behind a computer, programming tracks.... watch out he's gonna spill his Diet Coke all over the mixing board!"
1,Drawers do not consistently close,The construction of this cabinet is not sufficiently sturdy enough to ensure that everything lines up appropriately and the drawers can close completely.
4,Financial Defense,"This book is packed with ideas on how to live frugally and economically. It shows how to keep more of the money you earn by spending less. It covers most areas involved in playing financial defense from budgeting, earning extra money, getting and staying out of debt, to saving on purchases of cars, vacations, and grocery trips plus many more areas. The book will with no doubt pay for itself if only one of the many tips are followed. This book is for the truly penny pinching and frugal, it is Spartan and many people who are use to spending because they think they ""deserve"" things will likely find this book to extreme for their tastes. But the tightwad will find this book very informative and full of new ways to spend less while living well on a shoestring budget. Also check out the book ""Tightwad Gazette"" for even more money saving ideas."
3,Good for beginning photographers....,"I am A practicing photographer with time behind the lense. Alway's looking for a good book with diagrams of lighting setups and new ways to light. This was not the book for me and I would onlyrecommend it to starting photographers. It has diagrams and great photographs, but for simple setups. I wanted it to explorer great fashion photographs and show how the were done. Good for the self starter, but not someone in the know."
5,Outstanding,"Pros: This book had excellent ideas for lighting, with several examples, and also several modifications to ""popular"" lighting techniques. For fashion and beauty lighting, I haven't found a better book.Cons: The makeup and styling in several of the examples is somewhat dated-looking...so I would only use it for lighting, not styling."
4,"Good book, could have been much better","The diagrams are good, but could have been much better. They should have included EXACT exposure readings, EXACT size of lightsources such as softboxes, EXACT distances of light(s) from subject, EXACT exposure used (as opposed to metered incident exposure).Many of the photos are, sadly, so ""over the top"" in styling that they are useless as models or guidelines. Most readers trying to do pro-quality stuff would not want such bizarre styling.If a new edition comes out, it should have more complete data, it should concentrate on straightforward shots/lighting of the type most readers are interested in, it should cut way down on the bizarre over-the-top shots ... and would then be pretty much perfect."
1,"Basic book, from 1978","Other than digital, not much in photography has changed. Or so these people will have you believe. I wish there were more modern techniques, equipment and photography styles. Otherwise it's an okay lighting book, explaining the basics, but not much more you couldn't gather from a number of free websites out there."
3,"excellent, after some mods","First, this product is good idea, but the hardware (nuts and wood screws) are not up to snuff. However, they are very easily replaceable at any hardware store. In total I believe it cost me about $4 to get all of the correct replacements. The locking nut is essential for the bag to spin properly without unscrewing itself. Electrical tape across the horizontal bolt reduces the friction between itself and the bag hook. I also replaced the vertical spinning bolt with a stainless bolt and the 2 wood screws with galvanized screws, as my bag hangs outdoors. Bottom line, buy this and replace the bolts, screws and nuts with top quality ones from your local hardware store for an additional $4 and it'll perform for years to come."
3,Not for a heavy bag,I don't believe this product is strong enough to handle a heavy bag (80 lbs or more) given that it's supposed to be mounted on only one roof joist rather than across several joists. I use it for suspending a headache bag and it works fine for that purpose.
4,"Good value, easy to install","Basic heavy bag hanger, good value and no issue with it yet. Easy to install and it has everything you need."
3,Great Hanger!,"3 of 5 stars:The hanger itself is perfect. The hardware sent with the hanger is junk.After drilling the proper pilot holes, I sheared the first lag off. I went to the hardware store the next day and fortunately had the presence of mind to buy an extra screw......good thing because I snapped the head off of the other screw sent with the hanger. Oh and by the way, I used a 6"" handles 1/4"" driver......"
3,"Good product, read the reviews and ""update"" it to be fully satisfied.","I did just like most of the other reviewers did and added a longer bolt with locking nuts, steel tubing, etc. It works great now. I don't think it would last without the ""updates"" suggested by the other reviewers. I mounted mine to a 4""x6"" and mounted that to the ceiling so I could tie in more beams for support. Only three stars because It should probably come with the ""updates""."
2,Different Solution,"I did not actually buy this item, but because people had some issues with it and had to alter it to get it to work, I found a different option.I went to Home Depot and hot a heavy duty tie-down D-ring for $9.79 ($3 cheaper than this product). [...]I fastened it to the ceiling and hung the bag spring from it, then the bag from the spring. It works great. Won't have the problems with a nut and bolt coming loose like the heavy bag hanger seems to have. I used a couple of 3"" heavy duty screws to secure it and it's not going anywhere. The thing is rated for 11,000 lbs and I don't think I can kick that hard. You may be able to get a d-ring cheaper online that will work, but I wanted to make sure it was really heavy duty."
3,Requires a Nylon lock Nut to work!!,"After a week of wondering why the bolt kept screwing lose every time I hit the bag; paranoid that the bag would come crashing down at any given second, and not knowing how to resolve the issue. I read a review to buy a Lock Nut. I went out and bought a Nylon lock Nut and that seems to have resolved the problem. Why did this not come with the right hardware to begin with? It was like 99 cents for 2 lock bolts."
2,"It works, could be better.","This product works fine, but the horizontal bolt's threads will rub on your bag's hook. Can be a little noisy."
3,"does the job, but everyone makes it work because they mod it","so after reading everyone's review, its pretty much clear that you need to modify it for your needs. the top part with the wood lags is fine, no one has problems there. however the center bolt with the locking washer is something to be desired. i tightened mine down with a socket but still with my 70 lb bag it loosened up. someone had mentioned to change the order and put the nut on first, then locking washer, then another nut, good idea to allow it to spin. i will try that. however, currently what i had done was just remove the lower part and hang my bag directly through the screw hole on the top with a carabiner that came with my bag. problem solved....so far. so pretty much a beam attachement plate for 13 bucks, can't really complain, that part is solid."
3,In the works,"I just got the bag up with the hanger. After punching it for 20 minutes or so, the bolt in the center came unscrewed. I cant figure out if it is because my bag is to light and maybe it spins to much. I am going to rehang it and try it again. It stays mounted to the support beam just fine though."
1,shit dont work,When you punch the bag the bag spins and loosens the bolt and the bag falls off every time no matter what
3,Heavy bag hanger.,"This hanger does its job but it is no fancy item at all. Cheap Chinese bolts. Everlast used to be made in the USA, but now they make there stuff in China."
5,"GREAT PRODUCT, NO ISSUES!","Why pay mega-bucks for a heavy bag mount? This mount was 12.95 out the door with free super saver shipping. Mounted a 100 LB heavy bag in my finished garage using this mount. Great product, no issues!"
1,Not secure at all,It unscrews very easily and often. I need to find something else because I'm tired of standing on a chair every other day to retighten it. I don't recommend this at all
2,"Works, but not great.","It will hold a bag up, but you could probably buy a couple bolts at any hardware store and create a mount just as good. Since this setup was cheap, I'm not complaining, but if it doesn't spin, I don't see the point of buying this.I recommend spending $5 more and getting the Everlast Professional Swivel, which is more specifically designed for a punching bag."
1,My bolt snapped as well,"Worked for three days then one of the bolt's that screw the hanger into the wood snapped and left the rest of bolt in the wood. The other bolt was warped and looked like it could also snap at any time. I was using this hanger for a 100 hundred pound heavy bag. I wish I would have read reviews before buying. Should call this product a ""Light Bag Hanger""."
4,Well Constructed Heavy Bag Mount,"Fast shipping and good quality at the best prices. I've bought from Amazon many times and I am almost always completely satisfied with the product. They describe exactly what you'll be getting. This is a good mount for a heavy/ punching bag. It works well and easy installation (2 screws). Comes with everything you need. However you might want to put a locking nut on the bolt that holds the two halves together instead of the one they give you. I tightened it up, but I punched it loose and I just tightend it back up. This only happened once, I maybe just didnt tighten it up that great the first time. Still might be a good idea if you have this as a problem though. I used it on my 80 lb bag and it worked well for that. The screws they give you hold pretty good. It's a good mount."
3,shell,I bought this and the bag for a christmas gift for my son inlaw. The first time he used it one of the bolts snapped in half. We had to go buy better quality bolts to hang it with. other wise it seems well made just came with low grade bolts.
4,Secure Mount of Our 80-lb Heavy Bag,"I haven't had experience with bag stands (we don't have the room for one), but if you can mount your heavy bag to the ceiling, this is the holder for you.As pictured, the holder comes with bolts, locking washers and nuts to hold the U-shaped piece to the ceiling mount. If you don't tighten the nuts sufficiently (or fail to use the locking washers) you may have problems with them slowly loosening over time. This is your chance to show off your tightening skills.In my opinion, the included lag nuts are best installed directly into a wood cross beam. (I actually cut away the just enough drywall from the ceiling in order to get access to the wood beam.)You'll learn just how powerful your triceps are by the time you've tightened the lag nuts. Think of the install as your warm-up for your first session with the heavy bag."
3,Mediocre Design,"This bag hanger works well enough, and I've never really been afraid the bag was going to fall down or anything. But the span of the bolt inside the u-shaped bracket is much wider than the clip on the punching bag, so the clip slides back and forth all the time, sometimes getting caught on the threading on the bolt, causing the bag to swing awkwardly, or pulling down one side of the u-bracket so the other side gets pressed against the top bracket and doesn't rotate at all.But even though it's not perfect, it's much cheaper than swivel hangers, and it does the job. I don't think it's a safety issue or anything, it's just kind of annoying that this hanger doesn't work like it should, and makes the bag act a little funny."
1,Worthless unless modified,I read the other review and yes if you add an extra nut and washer the hanger works great. But you should not have to. The one star is based on what you get in the package. If you follow the directions the nut and bolt holding the two pieces together starts to loosen. Not good when it's holding 100lbs.
4,it works...ish,"So after getting the parts shipped and reviewing the reviews I went to work.1. Replaced the bolt that connects to the black pieces together. Replaced the under bolt the bag hangs from with a sheathed bolt to keep chaffing down. Cost $3 at home depot2. Realized I could have bought the rest of the parts for $2 at Home depot. But ok3. It's simple, it's solid, it hangs a bag."
4,First Aid Kit,"This item came sealed, however it may have been on the shelf for some time, one of the iodine packets opened and left goo all over the contents, took clean up of all the stuff inside. This is a cute first aid kit, and it is in my vehicle, appears to be in a metal container, it is plastic. Probably, I would buy this product again."
2,Glitch a thon,"Ok. So I gave some of this album a listen on Bleep's website (WARP Records' downloadable album site). Wow, uh. So I've noticed that almost everyone is trying to do this pretend act where they try to be Bjork and Autechre at the same time or something. Enough glitch music! Granted, I only heard bits and snips of this album, but it was enough to convince me to not buy it. I'm going to go listen to old school Aphex Twin now.."
3,14 in. twin handle cheese knife,"Knife works as expected,however we were expecting it to be stainless steel it seems to be carbon stel and rusts if any moisture is left on. cleaning and storage instructions sould be included."
2,Not at all what I expected,This CD has some good tracks but the music samples do not reflect that this is a live version. The screaming crowds take away from the music.
2,average,this cd is ok with jus avergae beats and poor lyrics which doesn't even compare to the greatness of ice cube and mf doom talents
3,A satisfactory single serve coffee maker -- but not the best,"I've owned single serve coffee makers by Mr. Coffee, Black and Decker and Melitta, so I have some basis for comparison in the remarks below. Mr. Coffee's design is satisfactory but not the best. I have owned two. The first worked reliably and produced rich, delicious coffee. I was pleased enought that I gave the like-new unit to a friend as a gift right away and bought another one for myself. The second unit, however, didn't work at all. I replaced it with Black and Decker and Melitta brands and found the Melitta unit to be an oustanding product, far superior."
1,Bad Choice!,"I love having my own cup of coffee and the machine worked great for a little bit, then I had leaks. After looking closer, there are cracks in the pod holder and on the machine itself. Please don't buy this, you will be unhappy with the huge puddle under the coffee maker."
1,"Exploding ""Home Cafe"" should be recalled","I have owned the Black & Decker Home Cafe system for about 6 months. Although the system creates an excellent cup of coffee, I am concerned about safety. The first unit had to be returned due to leakage around the seal. Tonight the unit exploded spewing coffee grounds and hot water in a 4 foot radius from the left side of the pod holder. I have taken photos and plan to tell my story Consumer Reports and anyone else that might listen."
1,Mr. Coffee should be ashamed,"I was eagerly awaiting my first cup. The 14oz travel mug option appealed to me as I like to have a cup on the road each morning. However, when using cold filtered water (what a novel concept), the water cameout only lukewarm. That was dissapointment number one. Disappointment number two is that it takes two pods to make a 14 oz cup of coffee. That immediately doubles the cost of supporting this. It is more economical to make a 10 cup pot of starbucks and pour out 8 cups. Then, to add insult to injury, the two pod 14oz cup of java I had was lukewarm and very weak. I was surprised by this as I do not like strong coffee. The positive experience is that it was easy to put back in the box and return."
2,"Internal explosion, poor design","After a couple of months use, there was an internal explosion and part of the pod holder was blown off. It also happened again on the one pod side too. From then on it leaked and finally stopped working. The design quality and materials leave much to be desired. It does have the best choice of coffees but these can be made in the Senseo pod coffee maker also."
5,Mr. Coffee rocks my girlfriends socks off,"Well, the Amazon.com specs for the machine are incorrect...it's 7 oz. 9 oz. or 14 oz. (the 14 takes 2 pods and is STRONG!!!) Good machine, good coffee, great price (got it for $31 @ Wal-Mart after using a $10 manufac. coupon."
4,Review of Birch Beer,"The birch beer I ordered was lacking in taste, and not like the birch beers I purchased back in the 70's. More Birch flavor is needed in these birch beer drinks."
2,"Shallow Man, Shallow Book","I agree with those who criticize the slipshod manner in which this book was written.After reading Instant Replay and others about the Packers of the 60s, I was expecting more from Hornung's book. I just get the feeling that here is a man who never a had a rough day in his life and who never questioned himself once."
2,long gone era,"Somewhat interesting, but Hornung is a fossil from four decades ago.Let his career and life rest in peace.He died several years ago."
5,Fantastic Techno Memories,"I lived overseas in Germany for four years, and this album was very popular. The main song was played at all the clubs, and my friends and I always danced to it. This album brings back great memories of the European Techno scene and I recommend it for anyone who is really interested in knowing how the Germans like their music."
5,Most comfortable shoes ever,I love these shoes because they have a nice style that can go with jeans or slacks and they are without a doubt the MOST COMFORTABLE shoes I have ever owned. I have bought them in teak and black and bought extra pairs of both.
4,A Great Compilation,"These tales are great for telling scary stories late at night. Read some of these stories, tell the story to a friend in your own words, and that friend will never forget it. For any fans of Ravenloft, ADnD, or the horror genre, this book is for you. You might not like all of the tales, but you will like enough of them to be content with your purchase."
3,great products...a little dissapointed,thought i was going to get the same kind as shown in the pictures. but instead got a different ones instead. :(
3,"Good, but not special.","I'm a little confused. The CD I have matches the picture (the purple cover with all the dots) and the track listing, but mine says Bainbridge Records 1988, not Black Tulips Records 1992.Anyway, the music is pleasant enough. Fairly straightforward renditions of these classics, a couple seriously abridged, but not too many ""Mantovani-ish"" touches. Of course, I realize Mantovani recorded a lot of classical pieces, without touching them up a whole lot.What's annoying to me is that most of the tracks run into the next, with no pause. That approach may work for a dance mix, but not for classically-inclined music. A little more care in the production would have earned this CD a fourth star."
3,"Not that great, but...","it costs only 5 bucks! The material on this cd is later stuff for the duo, recorded in the early & mid 70's. There are 11 tracks, not 10, and all are ok. Nothing really special like their late 50s and early 60s work. They re-do the Serpico theme though, heh. Bottom line: this is a worthy addition to your collection that is good homework/background music."
5,"Very useful, and not only for sports.","I have been reading and re-reading this book for the last year, and I am finding it immensely useful. The ""perception stretchers"" he lists are great not only for sports, but for many challenging career-related tasks and undertakings as well.I agree with some of the other reviews that a part of the book on ""you should trust that this works"" is overdone. However, it is only one chapter -- easy to skim or even skip entirely. The remainder of the book is great."
3,More music from Mister More Music,"A very good album by the unstoppable Bill Laswell. This one reminds me of the early days of his Axiom label, notably Material's HALLUCINATION ENGINE. The atmosphere is as Burroughsian as ever, with tracks collaging Indian and North African sounds with electronically-generated beats. Lots of basses, of course. There is a rock track that doesn't quite fit with the rest, but PERMUTATION is still a recommended CD."
3,Just another BSB book for kids,"As I said in the title, it's just another unofficial 'BSB' book geared toward the stereotypical female pre-teen set. Same as any number of others, it's a little more up to date, but typically gossipy. (I'm not sure how much of what is said is actually true as some of the events mentioned have accured already and not as written.) It's a cute book, good pictures. Recommended for the age group listed, but don't expect anything earthshattering. How about something for the non-stereotypical, screaming fan? We are out there you know."
5,skip meal between snack,"Inexpensive high protein waffers, delicious in vanilla, chocolate, strawberry & banana. Excellent choice for home, office, or on the road. I use them for weight control."
2,The usual stuff,"We've all read a million books like this haven't we? They're the Chinese food of literature: the platitudes sound profound when you're reading them, but 30 minutes later you're hungry for more"
4,Half dollars,"I received this work in perfect condition. It is not for beginners, but a very scholarly report on this difficult series. Well done."
4,Works as advertised,"I bought this to remove scratches from my fish tank. If you plan on using it to remove scratches from glass, make sure that the glass is worth repairing ... i.e. expensive to replace. It took me all day to remove the scratches ... mostly. There are still some very fine ones, but when the tank is filled, they are hardly noticeable."
5,Works on gorilla glass,"I had a pretty nasty scratch on my Galaxy S phone screen (gorilla glass) and then made it worse trying to fix it with other stuff. It was very visible while using the phone, especially on a white background - a rainbow scratch line and then lighter rainbow haze around it from the failed fix attempt. I used this cerium oxide with a Dremel felt polishing wheel and almost completely repaired it. It is not visible at all now while using the phone; you can only see a soft scratch when the screen is off. I may have been able to remove it completely if I kept going. You have to be patient and keep working at it - I spent at least 15 minutes on it. I wish it was sold in sizes less than a pound, but it was worth it anyway. I might try it on my windshield as well."
2,good for cleaning light dirt not the hard water stains,"I purchased this product based on reviews here at amazon, and I would say it was mostly misleading. I am repairing the storm windows for my house, no idea how old, but they were exposed long enough to develop water leaks through the glue line and most of them had mineral stains. These stains are stubborn. No matter what I tried, hand scrubbing at first followed by electric polished later all aided with a slurry of cerium oxide, the result was at best a hazy film. In the end those glass sheets affected by hard water stains had to be replaced with new glass.Otherwise a prompt delivery from the vendor"
2,wrong subject,"Look, this is a fine book, but I was led to believe it was about the cars; it is a history of the airplane engines...nothing wrong with that but of limited interest to most."
3,Fabulous...at first,"Love this feeder! My greyhounds love this too. It's tall enough for them, and it looks beautiful. I keep their leashes and treats in the drawer below. They love it when the drawer opens...don't know if they are getting a biscuit or a walk!Over time this did not hold up well. Any water splashes (and what dog doesn't splash water) cause the particle board to warp and the finish to peel off. Plus if you try to scrub it clean it gets damaged as well?"
5,Audio Nirvana,"This is in my top 3 cd ever, I can listen it all day long, I love it immensely. Beautiful original compositions, always inspirating, soo melodic and clever at the same time, extremely skillful. It is not about Snetberger, Andersen and Vinaccia play totally equal part in every song, every aspect, the whole album seems to be an endless improvisation of these three for me. Very relaxed, haunting album. Recording quality is state of the art, I use it to demo high-end audio systems. You will be blissed out."
2,A NON-ESSENTIAL CURIOSITY,"Recorded in late 1965, this release shows Curtis Knight & The Squires to be your basic sixties R&B; bar band. Oh yes, and they just happen to have Jimi Hendrix on guitar. (Though certainly not sounding like the Jimi the world would come to know and love a year or so later.) Not at all a terrible album, but in reality nothing all that special either. For historians and / or completists only. (PS: Terrific cover photo.)Tracks: Knock Yourself Out / Hornet's Nest / How Would You Feel / Welcome Home / Don't Accuse Me / Simon Says / Gotta Have a New / Strange Things / Fool for You Baby / You Don't Want Me / I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch) / (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction / I Got You (I Feel Good) / Mr. Pitiful / Money (That's What I Want)"
3,Deceptive,"The music is pretty good 60s R&B.; But nothing special.My gripe is the packaging which uses Jimi's name too prominently.The record label Jungle has a logo very very similar to Track Records who released Jimi's later work.Record # FREUD CD 066, maybe FRAUD would be more appropriate as isn't a Jimi Hendrix CD which the cover suggests.Just be aware of this before buying."
1,Poor Video Quality.,"I'm not reviewing the movie, but commenting on the poor video quality of the Amazon Instant Video download version. DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION for the following reasons:- Washed out color, extremely low resolution.- Widescreen but not 16x9, so the picture appears extremely small on any TV.- Scene changes bring changes in video quality.Someday someone will finally present a good video quality version of this fine sci-fi thriller. Don't waste your money on this turkey (I wish I hadn't)."
5,more than a birthing book,"This book provides a unique opportunity to love and understand yourself, as well as preparing to give your child an aware and healthy parent. Lucia gives the reader clear and easy-to use journal-writing tools which can transform old negative experiences into wisdom, and create the desired kind of future relationships in parenting and self-care."
1,Low Quality,I tried 3 different router bits in this set only to find they were not cutting the timber cleanly. I could not sell them to anyone knowing how bad they are. Consequently I have scrapped all the bits and have just kept the case.
4,A lot of Bits for the Buck,"A lot of bits for the price. Every bit has its own label. Bits come sharp. Good selection of different kinds of bits. Only thing I did not like was the case they came in, kinda cheap. But for the price still a good deal."
4,Neiko 80-Piece Premium-Grade 1/2 Inch Tungsten Car...,"For the money the Neiko 80-Piece Premium-Grade 1/2 Inch Tungsten Carbide router bits are a bargain. Everyone who routs should have this set for general use of the router. If you are starting out with a router, this set will give you tools that will let you do about anything with your router that can be done. Are they the best ever bits, probably not, but are you the best ever router user ever??? I'm not and they are a bargain and I have compared some other bits I have for cut and use and they compare favorably to much more expensive bits."
4,Good bit set.,"Packaging from shipper was good, I received these all in excellent condition. The case is flimsy to say the least, but was not damaged in shipping. Needed to wiggle bits first to release hold in case for bit removal. I found no nicks in any of the bits (I inspected all with a jewelers glass). The several bits I have used did an exceptional job cutting which was surprising, especially for an inexpensive set. Great for DIYers as I am not sure how long these would last in pro usage. Fantastic bargain!"
5,A great set of router bits for the price.,"So far as I have been able to see, this is a great value for the price. It contains effectively every router bit that you could want except for spiral strait bits and other rather unique specialty bits. Even more important, it contains all of these different bits in different sizes enabling a wide variety of projects without the expense of purchasing additional bits at a greatly inflated price. The tungston working surfaces provide for a good, sharp, stable edge that will hold up well and require minimum sharpening. I highely recommend these bits for amateur wood workers looking for a good value on router bits."
1,You get what you pay for,"I should have known better but good router bits cost more than a dollar. I tried a 1/2"" straight bit on oak and it tore the wood like crazy. It was a bit of an implus buy and I appreciate Amazon's return policy. I think for very modest use they will be fine but for quality work, plan to spend a minimum of $10-$15 per bit."
4,Router bits,They seem to be pretty good though I haven't had a chance to use them too much as of yet. For the routing I have done they have come up clean. They don't look like they are perfectly put together but good especially if you want a well rounded set of bits for a low price. Great variety to learn what can be done with router bits.
5,Just what I was looking for,This bit set surpasses what is in the retail stores in my area. It has 30 more bits for 10 more dollars when compared to Home Depot offerings. The aluminum case is great compact storage. I recommend this as a buy.
3,"bits ok for the price, storage box flimsy","bits ok for the price, storage box flimsy, what did I expect for the price? Bit quality is actually a little better than I expected. no nicks on the blades and so far no vibrations from bad balancing. The case is not strong enough to handle the weight, the sides started pulling loose about the fourth time I used them."
2,When will I ever learn...,"I've taught myself time and again not to buy cheap tools. But I could not resist the bargain of this complete set, especially after reading the glowing praise of others. For my first use of the set I needed a 3/8"" round nose bit. It had a nice large nick in the blade. Then I took a look at the other round nose bits and every single one of them has nicks in the blades. Not nicks that you can barely see but large nicks that can easily be spotted. If you are doing a lot of non critical work and have a limited budget, then these bits may be ok. But if you take pride in your work and expect perfection in the results...then you might be better off getting professional grade bits. I ended up making a trip to the local Wood Craft store and getting the actual bits I needed. The cost is about 15x per bit and that is hard to swallow but the results I achieved with the quality bits are worth the extra cost to me. Maybe I will give this bit set to a beginning wood worker."
5,80 Router Bit Set,"For us causal users this has got to be one of the greatest bargains one could buy for the shop. Assuming you have a router that accepts 1/2"" bits you get a fairly complete set of carbide bits, over half of which have bearings, that seem to do a good job. At around $1.30 per bit plus a decent case this is why we need to continue importing from China."
3,Chakras ~a wonderful holistic guide to the self~,I have read several books on chakras. I am a Reiki practitioner who uses the chakras to help my work with my clients. I also do a lot of work on chakras with myself. This book has furthered my understanding of the chakras to a degree and I thorougly enjoyed the subject material. However this book was not as developed as much as I wish it had been. For this reason I reccomend reading Anodea Judith's books. She has several on the subjects of chakras and the psychology of body systems.
2,Stains,Dirty from possibly coffee stains and maybe something else. It did wash off so I thought since they sold it as in perfect order I would think they would have washed it off before mailing it out to me.
3,Smaller than expected...,"Technically yes, this is a creamer. But truly this is nothing more than a toy. My bad, that's what happens when your in to big a hurry and don't really read the product details close enough. Guess I'll stick it in the kitchen window for the cats to stare at while they are lounging on my window ledge."
5,Live at the Cotton Club,"I got this as a gift for a friend. It had all the songs, by all the artists that she had been looking for. I liked hers so much, I got one for myself.Lisa Crandal, Ca."
5,Great go-to guide for quick and delicious Asian food,"I have had this book for about 10 years now and it's my go-to guide when I want some ideas for a quick dinner. I haven't tried baking in my wok, but the stir-fry recipes have always turned out well. It has good color photographs too, although not every recipe is pictured. As mentioned in the other reviews, you can really feel Ken Hom's enthusiasm for Asian food."
1,Poor Design!,"I was opening a bottle of wine with a stubborn cork and the wings broke off! The corkscrew has a very nice look and feel, but the large wings taper to a very narrow point at the hinges. And since it is made of a cheap cast metal and not stainless steel, it is very weak at the tapered area. Supposedly has a lifetime warranty, but I have not sent it back yet..."
3,Good for beginners,"I think that this book might be good for someone just starting to knit. If you have done much knitting, this probably isn't the book for you. I got it because I hope it will be helpful for beginning students. It does give some suggestions and formulas which will be helpful. I would probably recommend checking it out of the library instead of buying it."
1,Caution to sensitive skin!,"I don't normally have sensitive skin - I can usually try any facial product without worry. However, about 5 seconds after I put this on my face, it started to burn! I couldn't wipe it off fast enough. I haven't tried any of their other products because of this."
1,"NEITHER THRILL, NOR SF, NOR FRESH","Even if you are not an old movie buff, in the first 5 minutesyou can understand anything can happen in this film...except for themost inconsequential passages of this rambling story. Here thereare not only the problems of the B-movies, here there is not a script,and the actors don't know what they have to express. Somebody canthink the basic idea of this film is good (""Helen"", thecomputer which control the house, becomes so human that she wants killher creator and family to realize her choices) maybe he doesn't knowdecades of SF, above all Kubrick's ""2001"". The charactersare so stupid that ending you will hope for Helen's victory."
5,how does the saying go- if you have nothing nice to say,"If your into tech things you will like the movie. It gives insight into what computers could someday be like. the duel processor intel xeon 3.0's i own now is about 25000 times as powerful as the 386-40 i owned 7 years ago. how powerful will computers be ten years from now, and what will they be able to do. if you liked hal you'll like helen"
2,As painful to watch as it was to pay for.,"I watched this movie on SciFi channel, and I regretted as soon as the credits rolled. This is a no better than C grade movie, with B grade actors. That, and you'd have to be brain dead to take the movie at face-value. Take my advice, and avoid this movie like the plague, or you too may cry when you drink."
2,Ridiculous!!,"Where did this price come from! I just bought the same item from a sporting goods store in Waldorf, MD for $6.99. Big Norm's Magic Fish Scxaler is great. $15.99 is outrageous!"
4,product ad described,This filter works great to get extra color in photos my Alaska pictures turned out beautiful when using this filter. I am so glad I bought it.
5,GREAT!,"Absolutely tremendous work. The author compares Urshan with Haywood, for example. This is a must for a hungry student of recent pentecostalism."
4,"Yeah, um, what they said...","I just don't think this is the kind of five-star classic that will make a believer of the antitechno heathen. It's very nice to listen to, but the uninitiated and even listeners of catchier, dumbed down stuff (i.e. Prodigy & Chem. Bros.) might turn a deaf ear because little funk is kicked. It reeks of ""intelligence,"" and that may be why they give it five, and most wouldn't give five bucks (as I was lucky enough to find it for, new). Understand the head trip you are about to embark upon before springing for it."
5,a moving sequel to one of the world's great books,All I can say is that this sequel was everything I could have hoped for; readers of Angel Doll will embrace this book as well.
4,Billy the Kid 20 movie pack,"I love any type of westerns, older and newer ones. Can't go wrong for the price!Take a chance and purchase this, it is worth it, if you love westerns!"
4,Size 1 Fits Streamlight Strion LED,This holder (Size 1) fits my Streamlight Strion LED like a glove. It's the perfect length top to bottom and the strap holds it in snug.
2,"Good watch, unless you actually train for triathlons...","I bought this watch from a retail store (at about $55, so amazon has a good price), but as soon as I started using it to train for races I became dissatisfied with it. After being in and out of the pool a few times, the color changed from a bright blue to a dingy green and yellow. The indiglo backlight was the second thing to go, and the watch is useless at night. The timer stopped ringing when time is up, so I have to constantly look down at my watch to check when my workout is done- I'm sure water got in it. Finally, chlorine and sweat have made the watchband crack against my skin until the thing finally broke and fell off. If you actually run triathlons, find a different watch."
3,Not what it look like!,"Its a good quality shirt but it seems darker than the picture, closer to black. But of course, it doesn't come with the badge and also the patch on the shoulder. Just a plain shirt."
2,expensive and incomplete,My husband thought this was a Halloween costume complete with cap. It's not. Just a uniform shirt. It was expensive too! The company was good about the return.
4,iSub Cuts Off External Speakers,"I have owned and greatly appreciated the sound quality of the HK iSub for about a year now. However, I recently purchased M-Audio StudioPro 4 speakers from the apple website. After plugging them into my iMac through the speaker jack on the side, I enjoyed the pleasant mixing of the speakers and the iSub. After some time, I decided to see what would happen if the iSub were to be disconnected from the computer...The low-frequency mini subs of the StudioPro 4 speakers seemed to kick in as soon as the iSub was unplugged. This lead me to the conclusion that the iSub, being connected via USB, cuts off or redirects the lower-frequency sound from the external speakers.Is there any way the iSub and the mini subs of the external speakers could work simultaneously? Having more speakers playing the lower frequencies would be very favorable and as of now i am leaving the iSub disconnected."
2,"Good, while it lasted","I've had an iSub for a number of years, but it's worthless now. It didn't break, it's just not compatible with my current Mac. I replaced my aging iMac DV with a new Intel iMac. Unfortunately Apple dropped support for the iSub with Mac OS 10.5, turning my iSub into a useless paperweight. If you have a Pre-Intel Mac and want to improve your audio without a new pair of speakers this would probably work for you. Just remember it'll be worthless when you decide to get a shiny new Mac."
3,buy direct from manufacturer!!,Harman Kardon is selling this item for 25% less on its own website! buy it there!
4,Nicer than my PC's subwoofer,"This is nicer than my PC setup (HK speakers + subwoofer). The Apple Pro speakers and iSub on the 17"" Flat Panel iMac I own combine to give me rich sounds that I can hear all through my home. I'm running OS X 10.2, and I can control the volume of the iSub through the ""Output"" tab on the System Peferences' Sound panel."
5,An amazing resource.,"I did not think it possible that there could be names for just about every oddment and article on a building, but there is! One of the great features of the english language really, anyone with an interest in architecture, either professional or general interest, will find this invaluable. Sorts your pommels from finules and your spers from struts."
4,LapQuilting Lives,The book is ok.There is just really not much new .So much of this has ben covered in books before.
4,Pretty Quilts,"This book was fun to look at, but I don't think I will made any of the quilts. I like her previous quilting books better."
2,Major Disappointment!,"This book is not the ""how-to"" I expected so much as a very pretty but generalized ""fun ideas"" book. Good tag sale item (for selling),"
2,"An Israeli ""Inspector Morse""","I have enjoyed Gur's previous efforts as they are so ""atmospheric."" If one knows Israel and Israeli society - and not as a tourist - there is much being said between the lines that translation cannot capture.Unlike the earlier books, I found this one lacked bite.And Ohayon is turning into an Israeli version of ""Inspector Morse,"" i.e., a frustrated academic-turned-cop, a loner, lover of classical music (although not a sophisticated as Morse), unlucky in love - But, thankfully, not an alcoholic.But since Morse died recently, perhaps Ms. Gur will pick up the slack. (And tightening her writing is a good place to start.)"
1,"very disappointing, and not just the translation","I have read all of this author's works and the plots were always paramount, with great character development and intriguing ideas emerging strongly even through translation. ""Murder Duet"" for some reason is a poorly crafted story and even the translation cannot be blamed for the awkward writing. Into the recycle bin. Too bad. I waited a long time for this one to be published."
4,pharmacology book,"product in good condition, delivery was quick. product was as advertised. thank you"
5,Great for Safe Climbing,"I use these to anchor my top rope whenever I climb in JT. It's stood up to the harshest of conditions without any sign of coming undone or worse. This is my second time buying these because another brand I purchased is beginning to show signs of wear, and I don't want to take a chance on something like that when it's a life situation.I highly recomend these for any cllimbing application, as well as any time you may need to lock something down with a caribiner (i.e. on my flack to hold my gear)."
3,wrong carabiner!,"This is a nice black carabiner don't get me wrong, and i can use it but it doesn't have the screw lock which is why I bought it! Its a plain lever clasp or whatever its called. I will definitely be buying a screw lock carabiner from someone else!"
5,These are perfect!,"These arrived quickly and were exactly as described and shown. Very strong and easy to use, no problem with the screw getting stuck."
5,Very well made,Super solid. I use these to strap cargo onto my bike along with ratchet straps and wanted something that I could use to lift or tow with as well. The metalwork is excellent and the fit and finish is perfect. I have no doubt these will last for a very long time. Keep in mind they are pretty big!
5,Endless Internet info and more,"This book is so full of amazing, supportive information. The ideas by the multitude of Interent Experts are endless. Well done Debbie! I have already used 5 of the ideas from your book, and I have not even finished reading it yet."
2,Book should have been named when I,The book should have been named when I.All the author seeems to do is talk about herself.Much of the book is about general ideas and leaves you wondering where should I start.
3,80s instrumental guitar,"If you like guitarists such as Joe Satriani or Eddie Van Halen this cd may be worth a listen but there's no doubt it sounds dated. Driving hard rock guitar was big in the 80s and this ""guy"" was talented no doubt but not remembered as one of the best in the era. Guest artists include Alice Cooper and Kevin Dubrow (Quiet Riot). I personally prefer the high speed guitar work of Michael Angelo Batio or Joe Stump but this isn't bad."
2,Bad Cd but a great drink coaster,"I am going to give this CD two stars, because even though the CD itself is not listenable...it makes a great drink coaster. I had a house warming party and one of the guests was looking for someplace to put their drink. I couldn't find the right box but suggested using the crappiest CD that I bought for 25 cents in a bargain bin. Since I would waste more than the CD was worth in postage to have the ""artist"" reimburse me for it (and my wasted time listening to 2 seconds of Paint it Black), I figured this was a good enough use.This CD stopped an expensive end table from being ruined and therefore is worth two stars.For other fantastic coasters, I would recommend Pet Shop Boys (pick any album) and Shania Twain. Make sure your wife doesn't catch you though."
5,Great book on a terrible tragedy,"This really is the only book about the Our Lady of the Angels fire (except Michele McBride's understandably bitter personal account), and it is quite well-written, fair, and reasonably complete. And extremely emotional. I can't remember ever reading a book which so saddened and touched me. I can't really add anything to what the other reviewers have said either, except that I wish the book had footnotes, sources and was a bit more in depth. I would also recommend the PBS documentary Angels Too Soon and www.olafire.com, an extremely detailed and valuable website."
5,Wish it was fiction..,"great, great, great. You feel the trials this community faced, much more than just the fire. Fortunately, fire code improvements were made to minimize a repeat. Love the title too."
5,engrossing book,"This was a fascinating book. I bought it to read on a trip, because of the excellent ratings. We were stuck in a plane on a runway in Dallas for 6 hours. The wait seemed much shorter, because I was thoroughly involved in reading this book.I highly recommend it."
5,Excellent book very compelling and thoughtfully writtern.,"I was a third grade student at Hometown Elementary School, in the south suburban suburbs, on Dec. 1st 1958. I remember everything about that day. Up until then,at least in my young mind, death was something that was only for ""old sick people"". The children that perished in that fire were my age...they had left home that morning to go to school...and never came back. I have never forgotten that day."
5,I remember it Well,I was a young girl living in Chicago and remember this horrible fire. I was about the same age as these innocent victims. The facts and the passion the writer shows toward the victims and the rescue workers was very touching. Anyone who remembers those times will enjoy this book.
4,Another winner from Les Arts Florissants,"One of my Christmas presents (I cheated and opened it last week), this was given to me by a friend who knows I like Rameau, and this music is same era & same style. If I hadn't known, I would have guessed that this was Rameau's music, one of the operas I haven't heard yet. All the singers are excellent, Sophie Daneman is ideal for this music, and Padmore & Brua are also well-suited for Baroque opera. Great bargain price for this 2-disc jewel. Has Les Arts Florissants ever put out a mediocre recording ? Like CPO, Hyperion, Sterling and so many other smaller labels, Harmonia Mundi keeps unearthing diamonds for us. Recommended for lovers of Baroque opera and Sophie Daneman fans."
2,Where's the nuts?,"Came packed with a minty bone and absorbed the mint. When the mint left, there is no peanut butter scent to be found either. I do like the softness of this one but to get my dog to play with it for even a minute takes a lot of coaxing and he always loved his flossy bone and wouldn't leave it alone."
5,This is the definitive easiest choice of Linux distributions,"I use it on my laptop and are so pleased with it. I am a fairly advanced user having a lot of BSD boxes (OpenBSD and others) but for my Dell Laptop, I chose Mandrake. Mandrake 8.1 provided me an out-of-the box compliance with my videocard, my cd-burner (cdrecord and gnome utilities). My wireless Lucent network card worked INSTANTLY after boot, even with WEP encryption (yes, the installation program asked for the WEP-key!). This distribution gives you nearly everything you need. The only thing I miss after installation are rdate and StarOffice. KDE rocks and if you partition well (Always keep the homedirectories on a different partition), then a crash-recovery is done within an hour. NO TWEAKING was necessary after installation. My regards to the french hackers that made this possible."
1,"Outdated, ancient circa 2001 linux","It is very old 2001 release, it will not run on any of today's hardware. But even beyond that, the linux of today itself is completely different. I have no idea why this version is still offered. It is useless. Look on other reviews, they are from 2001!"
1,These treats not fit for a DOG,"We threw this garbage straight in to the trash. As far as our dog was concerned, he would rather eat sticks right of the tree branches than these crummy things."
3,"Good, easy to understand, but a complementary book.","I passed BCMSN exam today with the help of this book. This is a good guide for people who has a basic knowledge of switching technics, but for certification purposes, it is missing some topics, other topics are incomplete and let you with doubt.For example, if you read the multicast chapter of the Sybex book, and compare, you will notice the missing of several important things in CiscoPress book. This applies for Multilayer Switching (MLS) too. In case of RPR (Router Processor Redundacy), it simply doesn't cover.I also noticed that the questions of the CD-ROM is very easy. Don't waste your time training with this CD-ROM, just move to Testking or Crammater, so you will get ready.Feel free to contact me in case of sugestions for the exam."
2,New switching features but not adequate,This book has some interesting stuff about the new switching features that a CCNP must know but does not cover all the exam objectives. Also chapters lack depth. Multicasting chapter is a disaster compared to Karen Webb's BCMSN good old book. Generally most chapters are more like summaries and nothing more.
3,Does not offer good explanations or useful commands,"This book has a lot of useful information in it and may be a good review guide. But it does not do a good job of explaining items and does not offer many real commands - mostly just the command syntax. If you already know most of the material, then this book might be a good review. Otherwise I don't recommend it."
4,Vast improvement over 2nd edition,"Although the BCMSN test is the easiest in the CCNP, this book is worth the upgrade. One of the CCNP books you can actually read.Pros: Text makes sense to people with just CCNA switching experience. Good coverage of exam topics.Cons: Questions aren't that good. Not that good for a reference book after exam."
5,true skill,"This is his best global underground contribution and along with Resident it is his best work. On this album he illustrates the true skill that a world renowned DJ has. On disc 1 he glides through the clouds of drum 'n bass, changing it into breakbeat to set up his progressive finish. On disc 2 he begins with very heavy acid house and transitions seamlessly to trance. And with some applome. And picture this being live."
3,unique,"When I first listened to disc 1, I had to check to make sure I was listening to Oakenfold. The first 30 minutes of disc 1 sounded so much like LTJ Bukem (Drum and Bass), followed by the typical Oakenfold progressive trance, which I thought was good but nothing innovative or new. Not bad but I didn't find it as impressive as his Tranceport CD."
3,Ambient mixed with Drum n Bass,"I always can trust Oakenfold for a solid CD however, this set is not true Oakenfold. People in search of his typical proggresive trance will be slightly dissapointed. Many different genres are played with including ambient and acid jazz roots. Not a ""Tranceport"", but worth a listen."
3,"Good, but not great.","Despite that it is a beautifully imagined and beautifully written book, it lacks the magic to make it a great or wonderful novel. I enjoyed reading it, but I was disappointed in the character, her development or lack of it, and I guess I just felt the book was missing something. My expectations were very high because it was highly recommended. I would read Delia Sherman again."
2,Too much filler that has little to do with the subject of the book,"Disappointing. I was hoping for more of a look into the science of timekeeping, something as detailed and interesting as Dava Sobel's ""Longitude."" This book mostly contains a whole lot of rambling about Victorian attitudes and modes. Sandford Fleming himself was still enigmatic at the end of the book. I just didn't find enough here to hold my interest. Not recommended."
1,"Poor writing, questionable observations, bigotry","A poorly written book on a subject that deserves a better treatment. Some parts of this book are truly interesting, such as how time was reckoned prior to the introduction of standard time and how standard time came about. Most of the book, however, rambles on and on with the questionable observations and interpretations of the author. Particularly annoying is his use of the subject to endorse his quaint belief in Darwinism, his odd environmental views (somehow he finds his view that the world is ""warming"" relevant to the 19th century quest for standard time)and to position himself as oh-so-politically-(and academically) correct. He even adds a totally gratuitous afterward to express his bigoted views of Southerners. If you're fascinated with this book because of the title (Dr. Who fans are most likely to be deceived) forget it, it doesn't live up to it. If you must read this book, wait until the public library makes the mistake of buying it."
2,Some authors don't deserve their pulpits.,"The story of Sanford Fleming and the creation of standard time is probably a very interesting one. I wouldn't know, because Mr. Blaise is far too busy showing us how much he knows about art and poetry to tell us much at all about Fleming or his achievements.Time Lord veers off into long diversions on the subjects of French art (including most of a chapter devoted to one painting of which I'd never heard), classical poetry, and meditations on the meaning of time. It has nothing to do with Fleming or the creation of standard time, and it's also mind-numbingly boring. It gives the reader, to quote Harper Lee, the sense that one is slowly drowning.Even worse, Blaise tells us nothing of Fleming's later achievement, the laying of the first trans-Pacific cable, other than to mention it several times.If you're really dying to find out how smart Clark Blaise is, this is your book. If you want to know about Sanford Fleming, you're out of luck here."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in Blaise's book about Sandford Fleming and the Creation of Standard time. The book goes into some background about Fleming, which I found very interesting. The point incident that leads Fleming into developing and advocating a Standard Time is also very good. Unfortunately, Blaise loses me by changing the topic to the impact that the railroads had on the Victorian lifestyle, and his pages regarding Sherlock Holmes. I was hoping for more insight into the Prime Meridian conferences, but it didin't happen. I thought Hochschild's 'King Leopold's Ghost' a much better historical book."
1,Huh?,"Blaise certainly has an interesting style of writing - but I'm not sure that this is the area where it is best exercised.... I guess I was looking for a more linear account. Blaise seems to detour through all manner of tangential topics before not really getting to a point. At least no point that I was interested in.After reading this book I'm quite uncertain about Fleming's role in the standardization of time - in fact I get the impression that he was a bit player. Maybe that's not the case, but that's the impression I got from this book.Not a satisfying read - lots of loose ends and lots of ""hints"" of more interesting stories that don't quite come out."
1,"Thin subject, poorly done","As a cartographer, I looked forward to reading this book with the same professional interest that I gave Longitude by Dava Sobel. What I discovered was a very thin topic, fattened up with the author's personal observations and weak ties to the era of Fleming.Ten pages on Fleming and Standard Time in Wired magazine would have been a better use of print."
1,A waste of money,"I can keep it short: After seeing the success of Dava Sobel's Longitude (which is a wonderful book by the way), the author must have thought that there was some easy money to be earned. So he hastily has put together some facts, and one chapter on the aesthetics of time (of which I completely missed the point). The book is really poorly written, and is full of mistakes (on one page, the author even writes ""stanford flemming"" instead of sandford flemming. After reading it, it is completely unclear to me why we should credit sandford flemming with the ""invention"" of standard time...."
2,Time Less Style,"""Time Lord"" describes the development of the standard time zones arising from an epoch in which time was always local because travel distance was limited. With the advent of rail and steamship travel the need for standardization became imperative. The story is unfortunately handicapped by a pretentious writing style that appears to go off onto tangents unrelated to the the biograhical material or the historical material. The chapter ""The Aesthetics of Time"", on first reading, appears to have been an essay inadvertently bound into the book with no seeming relationship to the topic. I have read this chapter twice and can find no purpose to the chapter other than to dazzle ( or more appropriately confuse) the reader with the writer's literary erudition. This had the potential to rival Dava Sobel's "" Longitude"" but falls short."
1,Blaise is no Sobel,"Blaise's transparent attempt to gain from the popularity of Sobel's wonderful ""Longitude"" falls far short of the mark.From reading ""Time Lord"" I know that there was no Standard Time before 1884 and now there is. I also know that Blaise is more interested in showing off as a writer than delivering the promised story. In the few places where he provides any depth to the main story, his scientific facts are either wrong or so poorly presented as to confuse the reader.If you want to know more about time, there are other books far superior to this."
3,Gaa - 'Auf Der Bahn Zum Uranus' (Ohr),"Originally released in 1973, as this was the band's second of just two records. 'Gaa' means the Greek goddess of earth. Band hails from Saarland, Germany and even though they're often tagged as 'obscure krautrock', I personally thought their music was more in the hard rock vein. Also have heard this lp of theirs was an extremely limited edition of just 300 copies. Couldn't see the original album going for ALL that much money. Cuts that were most impressive include the opener, nearly ten-minute epic ""Uranus"", ""Tanz Mit Dem Mond"" and the group's namesake ""Gaa"". Line-up: Werner Frey-guitar&vocals, Helmut Heisel-guitar, Gunther Lackes-keyboards, Peter Bell-bass and Stefan Dorr-drums. Heard the guys even reunited sometime in the mid-'80's. Boy, you just never know. This is a long shot, but just might appeal to some fans of Space Expolsion, Guru Guru, Cluster and Throbbing Gristle."
2,Needs a better design,"This is the second potty I purchased for my son. He has difficulty peeing entirely inside the removable bowl. Very often urine ends up on the floor or even under the removable bowl. I like the overall design, however, it is not well suited for a little boy and could be a little more stable. I would say if you are buying a potty for a petite girl this would do other than that I would not purchase this again."
5,Favorite old-time Christmas Movie,"Meet Mr. Kringle Digitally Remastered Collector's Edition. A classic Holiday Christmas Movie, that is perfect for the whole family."
3,the good the bad and the down right unfair,"I picked up this CD in disbelief you see i was amember of company b in 1989 we did the gotta dance album and then did a whole album that got shelved. or so i thought only to find outt through my niece that Ish Ledesma released it with diffrent girls names in the credits. I will say this, the vocals are great for what they were at the time the writing was fair but the sneaking cheating lieing Ish did was very wrong and I'll make sure that he does make ammends for this...soon!"
3,Poorly transposed from tape to DVD,"I just recently played the disc which I received promptly before Christmas, and was somewhat satisfied, probably because the movie was a long awaited treat from my childhood, but was mainly disappointed with the sound and audio quality. Items of discontent were: 1.) no scene menu, 2.) sound had to be ridiculously advanced on my system to hear properly, 3.) audio intermittently broke up and skipped, and 4.) video also intermittently stalled, with the appearance of green tiling from time to time.I have a decent system, and I am particular about handling all my movies. Problems still existed after careful cleaning.I'm disappointed, but am willing to live with this, unless I can be assured that a new disc, which was checked thoroughly so as not to exhibit these flaws, could be exchanged for this one, with no trouble, and no extra cost."
5,Beautiful and wistful,"Lili is a really enchanting musical fantasy.People often forget it is just that-a fantasy.It is beautifully and sensitively acted by Leslie Caron and Mel Ferrer.I fell in love with Mel Ferrer just like many others seem to have done.No wonder-he was a good man and actor. This movie seems to protray many deeper emotions and feelings than most musicals do.It reminds me of Green Mansions(starring Audrey Hepburn),but I definately would never call it ""creepy"""
5,the perfect use of the Emotionally Distant Paramour as Hot Stuff,"The emotionally distant beau who silently seethes for you is a big moneymaker. Look at the success of Robert Pattinson in Twilight. But it's complete b.s. because if someone acted like that in real life, you'd be sending them away with your silently seething ill wishes. But oh, oh, oh, Mel Ferrer and his perfectly displayed physique allegedly ""hates [his] body"" because fighting off the Germans in WWI gave him a limp. Charming French Jew Jean Pierre Aumont dazzles original recipe elf Leslie Caron playing a 16! year old but Catalonian Mel is watching from the wings, giving her money (excellent) by way of employment (much better) and regular doses of attention. This is really THE Mel Ferrer movie. In one of his last public appearances, I saw him on tv and he hadn't changed at all! He just looked older with gray hair but the silhouette was STILL there. Incredible. Laudable."
4,I have always loved this movie.,"I have waited a long time for this film to come out on DVD, and I am glad that it finally did. The picture quality was not very sharp, but I am still happy to have it."
4,A Wonderfully Sweet Movie!,"I also fell in love with Mel Ferrer, I think any girl would.. :o) This sweet movie stole my heart away. For the incurable romantics, this is a must see! I, personally have bought this classic and added it to my collection. A wonderful movie, sweet and endearing."
4,Lili (VHS tape),"This movie is a classic. It is extremely poignant. The acting is superb. Though the movie is more than 50 years old, it remains quite relevant."
1,unsatisfied,"No chance to say whatsoever. The VHS in in NTSC and can't be watched in EU without conversion which is, at present and after so long since we lost this system, impossible to obtain at a good price. So far the best price was 150e which is 5 times more than the price of the VHS you sold me... My recommendation is that you specify in your site which format of VHS you are selling... not all the world breathes at USA's pace..."
5,leslie and mel were fantastic,"I DO NOT REMEMBER HOW I FIRST CAME TO SEE THIS MOVIE. BUT I REMEMBER WATCHING IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER. I JUST COULD NOT GET OVER THE FANTASY THAT THE MOVIE PRESENTED. I REALLY ENJOYED THE PART WHEN PAUL AND LILI ARE DANCING AND PAUL IS STUNNINGLY DRESSED IN BLUE. I CAN'T REMEMBER ANY ACTOR I HAVE EVER SEEN LOOK THAT GOOD IN BLUE BEFORE OR SINCE. THE ENDING WAS WONDERFUL WHEN LILI RUNS BACK TO THE PUPPET SHOW AND SHE AND PAUL FINALLY SHOW EACH OTHER HOW MUCH THEY LOVE EACH OTHER. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THIS MOVIE IS IN MY HANDS. WILL DEFINITELY BE PLAYING IT ON ""REPEAT."""
5,One of my favorites!!,"This is a movie I remember as a child and my children also remember watching too. I bought this as a Christmas gift for each of my grown children, to bring back fond memories of his/her childhood. A wonderful movie about a young lady finding her way in the world. Her love for the puppets is my favorite part. I will watch this over and over again. It is rare to find it showing on TV. Was so excited when it came on DVD."
5,Lili the movie on DVD,I saw this movie a long long time ago and loved it. Have been looking for it on DVD for awhile.
5,LONG AWAITED RELEASE OF THIS FILM,I HAVE WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS WONDERFUL FILM TAKES ME BACK TO MY EARLY CHILD HOOD THE QUALITY WAS EXCELLANT KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK IN RE DISCOVERY OF THESE CLASSICS
2,Cute Pink Fluff,"You must read the NY viewer's ""creepy"" review. It's positively hilarious and mostly astute. Alas, another musical in which Caron plays the title ingenue with a repetitive two syllable name. I'm surprised the musicals ""Kiki"" and ""Fifi"" weren't made, or were they? Anyway, this one is slightly more bearable than Gigi. The storyline is no less inane, and the songs are no less annoying but, it is shorter and there are fewer songs. Caron is somewhat charming, and Zsa Zsa is somewhat feisty. Why do the creators of musicals insist on putting in these idiotic, supposedly symbolic, song or dance sequences which are meant to neatly wrap up the whole story? Frankly, the end dance sequence with the puppets was almost excruciating to watch. This movie is one of the reasons why musicals are now only made in animated versions for children."
3,"Great movie, disappointing DVD","After so many years of expecting the release of this DVD, it is discouraging to discover it has no subtitles whatsoever, not even for English hearing impaired, and consequently not in any other language. Warner does not realize we live nowadays in a global world and this DVD remained in the 50's. Furthermore, it does not include any chapter division nor any other extra material. Warner, as owner of MGM classic movies archives used to manufacture DVDs of these movies with great quality but not anymore."
3,"ONLY IF YOU LOVE LILI VERY MUCH , BUY THIS DVD","I LOVE THIS MOVIE: THE COLOR ,THE MUSIC, THE STORY PLOT AND MOST OF ALL LESLIE CARON. UNLESS YOU ARE CRAZY ABOUT LILI,DON'T GET IT BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A VHS TRANSFER.THE QUALITY OF THE IMAGE IS POOR AND I THINK THAT THE VHS IMAGE IS EVEN BETTER,I CAN SAY THAT CUZ I ALSO HAVE THE TAPE AND IT DOES LOOK BETTER.BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT MY VHS PLAYER HAS BROKEN FOR GOOD AND I DECIDED TO GET THIS DVD TO WATCH LILI ONE MORE HUNDRED TIMES AGAIN. THE STUDIO MUST RELEASE THIS FILM ON DVD. PLEASEEEEE..............AS FAR AS THE SELLER IS CONCERNED, I HAVE NO COMPLAINS AT ALL."
4,A wonderful movie very sweet,"Alright it quite on the level of Roman Holiday (1953) it a very sweet story about human weakness and love. Do people not get it the Mel Ferrer (Mr. Audrey Hepburn) non puppet charcter is a week part of the whole. The other aspects are represented by the puppets. This is not too aspect symbolism. It just wonderful love story. I guess in an time in need of heros we have all become such spholicated aduits that nothing can be magical. Note to all those that fall in love with Mel Ferrer 1. by late 1954 he was spoken for and 2. not a great husband- Imaging married to Audrey Hepburn, and ceating on her."
4,how can people dislike this carming film,"While, niether the movie or the perfromces are on the same level of Roman holday (1953) this is very wonderful film that works for both audlts and kids. For the kid there are the dancing and the puppets and for the adults there is the wonderful love story. The movie could however could have been much better if it did not have a hollywood (happy) ending. Note on dimise of the live action hollywood musical. One has to look to the four productions that sunk it. Mary Poppens pure unadulted suger, one need a dose of insulen after seeing it. The second the sound of music plabulm. Hello dolley- filmed at the cost of 2 waterworlds. Finally lost harizons/ evitia, self important wastes of film stock"
1,Movie...LILI,"Unfortunately the video I received was not viewable. It had many glitches. The video jumped all over, had a rushing sound so the dialogue was not heard, and was a complete mess.I have notified the seller, and he has told me to keep the video,(?), and he will reimburse my purchase price...I am still waiting for that to happen."
3,"Even for 1953, this has some problems","After seeing a revival of Carnival at the Kennedy Center about two years ago, I wanted to see this. When I found a used copy recently, I was disturbed. The story focuses on a woman who borders on social retardation and a man who loves her who is emotional abusive unless he's using his puppets to communicate emotion. Hmmm. Worth watching, but what it says about gender roles in mid-century America is just downright disturbing."
4,ADFoster Classic,"This is the 2nd book of the Icerigger Trilogy. Great sequel to Book 1, Icerigger, it continues the adventures of Ethan Fortune, Skua September, Williams, the Tran, et al. Though this series was published in the 70s, the themes of adventure, discovery, honor and chivalry are timeless. I have read and re-read this series countless times and will do so again in future. In fact, that's why I looked for the old hardcover edition. I had already worn down 2 copies each of the old paperbacks.Set in Foster's Humanx Commonwealth, these series can stand alone or be read as part of the greater 'whole'; i.e. body of work. Aside from the Flinx and Pip series and Sentenced to Prism, probably part of my top 10 by this author."
1,Chelsea Watch - Beware!,"I got my watch and the battery was dead. Tried to call Chelsea Watch and they are not listed. Tried to write them via email, no reponse. I guess I am out money, and need to replace a battery on a new watch. Be careful from buying from Chelsea Watch. Should have checked if they were an actual listed company with some customer service."
1,Don't know what other reviewers are talking about...,"For an artist with such wonderful words & music...the late Mickey Newbury deserves a super collection. But this set is just 10 lp's put on CD. It says Digitally Remastered on it's cover. But there are are more pops, snaps & cracks in the listening then a bowl of rice krispies. Let's hope some of these albums come out on CDs in the future because his music should live on in its' intended form. But save your money here, buy the LPs... they might be in better condition then this collection."
5,Brilliant!,This book made me a convert to Berlin's work. It introduced me to German writers like Hamann whose works are not readily available in English. I highly recommend this book--even for the general reader. It is very accessible as it is the edited transcript of his lectures.
1,Willing to pay for this book?,"What's rough about this guide book? Oh, the information! I don't know who this book is written for, because as a regular backpacker, I find it completely useless. Two major problems are the lack of sufficient information about hostels (there's plenty of hotels listed, though), and there's no information considering the costs of travelling around Italy.Unless you are travelling with a suitcase full of money, don't buy this one.Oh: I tried to rate this book as ""-"", but it wasn't possible. One star given is too much."
5,To be fair...,"I'd like to offer another review from just the one out here - although I have not used Rough Guide to Italy, I just got back from Switzerland where I couldn't have survived with out my Rough Guide!It was comprehensive (the smallest of towns we went through had information in the guide), provided detailed city maps (which we could do our own tours), and offered good info on hotels and meals. Granted we are not student backpackers and looked for a guide that was fit to our needs - that is what Rough Guide to Switzerland did for us and will be doing for us through Italy!"
4,WWE No Way Out 2007 review,"The 6 man tag team match was pretty good for a opener. The Cruiserweight Open was a high-flying showstealer. The Mixed tag team match between the team of Finlay & Little ""B"" against the team of Boogeyman & Little Boogeyman was a pointless comedy filler. The King Booker-Kane match was a solid back-and-forth brawl. The Smackdown tag team title match between the team of Paul London & Brian Kendrick & the team of Deuce 'n Domino was a high-flying,hard-hitting tag bout. The ECW World title match between Bobby Lashley & Mr.Kennedy was a pretty good match and it could have done better without the lousy DQ ending. I mean,why could'nt they make the match a hardcore match? Afterall,it is the ECW World title. The HBK/John Cena-Undertaker/Batista tag team main event was a hard-fought,nail-biting,heart-stopping tag team bout. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10."
5,Here are the extras,it has a bonus discHere's the 2nd disc:HBK/Cena VS. MVP/Kennedy (SD 2/16/07)Batista/Taker VS. Rated RKO (SD 2/16/07)thats it for disc 2 A waste of a disc IMO for 2 matches. Extras for disc 1 include:Chavo Guerrero: Post match commentsBehind the scenes of Ashley's Playboy shootTaker/Batista/HBK/Cena VS. Rated RKO/MVP/Kennedy (Raw 2/15/07)
4,No way out predictions (just guessing),Main Event:World Heavyweight TitleBatista Vs. Kennedy vs. UndertakerThis one is being teased if you watched the 1/26 edition of SD Batista will win at the Royal Rumble but of course Kennedy wont shut up saying he got screwed out of the title and demand a rematch thats when Taker will come out and in some way it'll turn into a triple threat matchU.S titleChris Benoit vs. King Booker or FinlayTag team titlesLondon and Kendrick vs Deuce 'N DominoHelms vs BoogymanKane vs Mvpthis will be some kind of stipulation match again hinted by the 1/26 edition of SDMatt Hardy and joey Mercury might also be in action
4,A splurge....,"This one was a splurge... great music but over-priced for the three tracks. But after all that, the music is actually worth it..."
2,Could have been great,"I am a huge Smith fan, and I have read all the Arkady Renko novels. The thread running through all of Smith's work is the anti-hero. Arkady Renko, the protagonist in the Russian spy thrillers, is perfect. In December 6th, about the last days before the Pearl Harbor attack, Smith scores again with the dilapidated drunk womanizer American journalist. In Stallion Gate, I for one didn't care for the anti-hero, an Indian army sergeant with a broken career.I bought the book for its reference to the atomic bomb testing, and like other reviewers I like that part for its historical importance. However, all the protagonist's rummaging around with old Indian chiefs just leaves me cold. For the first time in Smith novel, I found myself scanning, although I did finish the book. Stay away from this one, and get any other Smithh novel. Apart from this one, they are all great."
2,No Action,"I would stick with the Gorky Park series, which is really this author's strong suit. This book just did not get moving and after 250 pages I gave up. I just did not care what happened to either the characters or in the story as a whole."
2,A Non-Fiction Novel (mostly novel),"A great time in our scientific history is given an exciting portral by author Cruz Smith. Unfortunately, there is so much fiction inserted in the story that it alters it's the true flow and demeans the wonderful and courageous real-life characters of Oppenheimer, Groves, Fuchs (the spy), etc. In fact, the central character of Joe Pena is perposterous on it's face. A straight non-fiction telling of this fantastic time at Los Alamos would have been much more interesting."
1,Very Poor,I stopped reading halfway through the book. The story never caught my interest nor made much sense. I just gave up. What a waste of time.
3,Not Smith's Best,"Many writers today find a successful formula and stick to it... over and over. The only thing the same from Martin Cruz Smith's works are their high level of excitement, interesting characters and plot development. Stallion Gate doesn't live up to Smith's past work. What he does best is gives the reader an insiders' view of a setting totally different than what the audience is used to. Whether it be Los Alamos during the development of Man's deadliest weapon in this novel, Cuba in Havana Bay, Japan in December 4th: A Novel, or the Soviet Union in Gorky Park, with his characters on the verge of an exciting adventure for the reader to be a part of.I enjoy Smith's books. Even Stallion Gate which isn't one of Smith's best efforts, still had more entertainment value than some other writers' best!John Row"
5,Star Crossed??,"I went looking for this book for a friend. I had read it when it was published years ago and was more than impressed with the story. It was just a great read! I noticed all of these ""1 Star"" ratings and could not imagine who might give it that sort of evaluation. It just ""ain't so."" This is a terrific book and,although, Cruz may not hit four or five ""Stars"" everytime out, he did with ""Stallion Gate!!"" Try it, you'll like it!"
5,Surprised,"I am surprised to see this Cruz Smith book received a lower rating than his others. I've read them all, and this is my favorite IN SPITE of the truth of so many of the reviews: little action, foregone conclusion, and most missed the fact that it also depends on numerous prototypical characters that are barely convincing, including the hero Joe. BUT THE WRITING IS BEYOND anything, Cruz's best. There are set pieces here of perfect beauty, but they seem unrelated to anything until, much farther on, you suddenly see the light. Exciting writing rather than exciting story, although that part is not so bad at all."
2,Great Idea-Poor Execution,"This book seemed like it would have everything going for it -- one Islamic Studies professor and one Professor of Judaism giving their viewpoints on the history of the Palestine-Israeli conflict.What a dissapointment! Both Dan Cohn-Sherbok and Dawoud El-Alami give a 75+ page synopsis each of the conflict's history, in dry, confusing and poorly edited prose. Only in the last 15 pages is there any attempt at ""debate"" and even that was disjointed, with the authors jumping from chapter to chapter with their comments.I fault the editors - OneWorld Press in Oxford--for the lack of readability. With such erudite authors, why not have a twenty page overview of the historical facts and then have the bulk of the book be a series of questions with both professors offering their viewpoints? That, to me, would have been a fascinating book. Instead, I was counting the pages until this was over. I still think it's a great idea and maybe some other publisher will do it right."
1,Palestine Doesn't Exist,"I'm surprised the author used the historically illegitimate name ""palestine"" which was invented by the Romans to briefly rename Israel during the second century under the Roman Empire, later anglicized by the British to denote Israel during the British Mandate. So-called ""palestine"" ceased to exist in 1948 with the termination of the British Mandate and Israeli statehood.Today, so-called ""palestine,"" which never existed during 400 years of the Ottoman Empire and which Arab leaders vehemently opposed after World War I, is used to delegitimize Israel.Israel appears in the Hebrew Bible, New Testament and even Quran 2500 times. Number of times so-called palestine appears in these three texts: Zero. Not even once.The only historically correct name of the land is Israel, dating back 3000 years."
2,Nothing special.,"This anime isn't one of the best I've ever seen. It's your ordinary person in a fantastic role, forced to become a hero in a good vs. evil struggle. In Nazca, a group of Japanese citizens discover they were Incan warriors in a past life. Sound far-fetched? Their awakening souls start ruling their being, and friends become enemies. Will the good student be able to stop his now evil kendo teacher from unleashing the power of creation on the world?The creators of this anime thought it would be a good idea to mesh computer generated scenes in with the animation. It wasn't a good idea. The characters look out of place and distorted whenever the CG backgrounds are used.Nazca is an all right story, but you can pretty much guess how it's going to end. I don't feel it's worth purchasing 4 DVD's to see the entire saga."
4,good fantasy anime,"This is a well done, intelligent fantasy. I didn't find the plot to be particularly slow-moving at all [of course, I wasn't expecting explosions and battles and naked chicks every five seconds: your definition of ""slow plot"" may vary]. I didn't care for the CGI/animation mix that was done in certain parts -- it wasn't seamless and I found it to be distracting; the character animation however is quite pleasing and their Incan warrior incarnations I thought especially well-designed [historical innacuracies and all -- this *is* a fantasy, you'll recall]. The opening JS Bach tune by Eccentric Opera is a nice change from the usual j-pop.Overview: intelligent dialogue and good looking guys fighting each other in nifty costumes.. works for me! :)"
3,"Nazca wasn't all that bad, i liked it","At first when ive seen the cover of this anime for sell in a store i wasn't so sure if it was worth buying, but althought i have decided and purchased it, meanwhile when finish watching the DVD ,the plot was a little off balance i find but was great peace of work, Nazca is based upon a true story in Egypte but don't mean that it is exact, because it is not the same of its categorie necesarely, althought i have injoyed this anime with the interesting costumes and designs of the atmosphere of the backgrounds and as for the CG scenes...well i guess it could of been better but anyways, i do recommend this animation out there for others that like fantasy stuff, i do indeed."
3,Great opening theme song but only mediocre episodes,"Nazca has one of the most beautiful theme songs I've ever heard, but after the first fifteen minutes of the first episode and the last fifteen minutes of the fourth episode the story lost my interest. The artwork is gorgeous and the song is fantastic but the the plot is slow for the majority of the episodes 1-4."
2,slow...moving...plot...,"There's not much wrong with the technical details of this title. The animation is fine, the sound is good, and the music is nice (if remixes of classical tunes are your cup of tea).What really bothered me is the plot. There's nothing wrong with the plot itself, but it moves terribly s-l-o-w...After the first disc, all we know is that several people living in Japan know eachother from previous lives during the time of the Incan empire. Not too much to show for after 90 minutes of animation, right?The complete lack of any progression in the story during the first disc has put me off buying the others. If you watch anime for interesting character designs and the animation, you'll enjoy this title. If you watch anime for the stories being told, I can't recommend this disc."
2,A Bomb,"The animation was only improved by haveing CG added. Otherwise back to saturday morning cartoons. The music is top notch, even though it was a remix of Johann Sabastian Bach it was very well done, I think he would approve. The plot, silly, but that's just anime. The pace...somebody SHOOT ME!! My God, can you draw it out any longer?! The whole thing could have been fininshed on the first CD!! And it does get preachy, but then again that is the same with all Anime, eco/political/social/american bashing is the norm in almost all anime from Japan. It gets two stars for music and CG animation, that's all."
2,Quality,The quality of the medium was much grainer than expected. It took away some of the joy of a John Wayne day of movies. We wished that there had been a few more color films.
1,Ripped off,"Xtremely dissapointed with the quality (or lack there of) like a vhs video that has been a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy (you get the drift) the colour in the colour dvd's is totaly washed out BUT as they say ""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"""
3,Not his greatest but a decent set of movies,"The good thing about this dvd set is there are 25 movies, the bad thing about this is the more famous movies are missing from the collection. For the price it is worth purchasing if you are a fan of the duke, else you may be disappointed at the collection as most top 15-20 John Wayne movies are missing from this collection."
3,"Plenty of movies, just not the famous ones.",Bought this for my dad who is a HUGE John Wayne fan (actually has a poster of him in his den) and he loved the fact of having so many movies to watch. Do note though that he told me he had only heard of one in the entire collection. This meant to him he had NEW movies to watch but to me meant they may be the not-so-good ones. At least 95% of the movies on the disc are from the early 30's so judge for yourself from there. He was happy with it and that was all that mattered to me.
5,Huge Western Fan,I can't remember how many years my dad has watched old westerns for. All I can say is how happy he is with all John Wayne for as long as he wants. Never gets tired of watching the same movie multiple times
3,No color!,"This item claims that the format is ""color"" and absolutely nowhere in the product description does it say black and white. I thought this odd since I know these movies in particular were filmed in black and white, but thought that maybe they had been retouched in color since, again, the format claimed ""color""Disappointed that they all were black and white, but regardless, a good buy for less then $10"
2,"Content is great, but the DVD will only work occassionally","This is a great set of movies, my Dad is really enjoying it. But 3 out of the 4 discs he has had to clean multiple times in order for them to play. They checked the DVD player, and we even tried it on a second player and it just doesn't seem like the quality of the discs is very good. I don't see that other people have had a problem like this... maybe I got a bad set. Thankfully he has had a good sense of humor about it"
5,John Wayne Ultimate Collection,I was excited and loved ordering this DVD movie collection. I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more HAD I RECEIVED IT!!!!!
3,Problem with discs,"I am a fan of John Wayne and I really looked forward to receiving this set.When I started playing them, Disc #3 would not load and a screen error said ""Playback may not be available on this disc.""I tried to return the set for a replacemnet but was told Amazon could not replace anything they did not ship directly as the shipper's stock changes fequently. Yet on amazon website it shows these are in stock.The movies I got to watch were really fun to see, but not being able to see the third disc is a real bummer. I would warn you to be careful about purchasing this product."
4,The Duke a winner,"I bought this video collection for a friend who is a big fan of the Duke. Most of the titles were unknown to both of us and we were initially disappointed in the make-up of the collection. However since my friend had just been released from the hospital, he had plenty of time to watch the titles in the collection. My friend told me that even though he had not heard of many of these titles, he found them to be mostly enjoyable. It has turned out to be a very good purchase for both of us."
4,John Wayne-Ultimate Collection,"These are some very old but very good Wayne movies. The show the progression of his talent. If you really love him you need to own these,"
1,missing scenes from the movies,i have watched a lot of these movies on this set more than once..and there are scenes missing from the movies..important scenes that deal with the plot of the movie...i would not recommend this to anyone who is a buff of old westerns
3,Believe it when they say Mini,"The Chocolates are about one square inch...smaller than expected. I think in size and not ounces so it was a surprise to see such a small amount of chocolate for the amount of dollars. I did not try them, they were gifts."
1,it is stealing....................,If you have a chance to have a Trader Joe close to your home buy this pyramide there because by amazon it is so tiny treats and so expensive.It is good chocolate but it is the price of caviar.....................Stay away from this product
1,Chocolate was not particularly good,we ordered this chocolate thinking it would be interesting. It was itsy bitsy teeny weeny and not very good. Shipping costs seemed overpriced for how little it weighed.
1,Don't bother,"Don't bother with this item , the price I paid for shipping and handling should have been the price for the item. I knew it would not be big but it was even smaller than I imagined , soo pathetic I couldn't even use it for the gift. It came nicely packaged though and in a timely fashion."
1,Rip-off,Great chocolates but ridiculously overpriced. Buy larger versions of these same chocolates in Trader Joe's for far less than the cost of these nibbles!
4,*Good*,"It takes atleast 15 minutes to heat up. The center rollers heat up more than the outer ones. Which are the bigger size rollers. I like them, however they should have come with stronger clips and atleast enough for all the larger size rollers. This is my first babyliss product. We have relaxed hair and they do work."
1,This is only the first book of the quartet,"This is NOT the quartet. It is only the first book in the quartet. I suppose it's a good book, but it is not what it claims to be. The one I really wanted to read, The Living Mountain, is not here. I guess there is just not a professional oversight staff to insure that embarrassing errors like this not be made."
1,One song equals one star,"This album is hideous: a huge number of sounds-the-same dance tracks, just generally boring to either listen or dance to.If the album has one redeeming quality, it is the final song, ""Fascinated."" This is an incredible dance track, with a wonderful opening and ending. The opening, which starts with only a drum-machine beat, adds more and more instruments, building the danceability of the song. After meandering and pounding through about five minutes of typical dance-song lyrics, it begins to strip away each instrument, until all that is left is the same drum-machine beat. Very well done.Unfortunately, the rest of the album is a waste of CD space. Company B should have simply released a single, and forgotten about any attempt at an album."
3,disappointed,"I have bought several cds from Hot Productions which are CDRfrom the series THE BEST OFhazell dean destinationangie gold silver conventionsanta esmeralda man 2 manphyllis nelsonALL OF THEM AARE CDR ,CDR CDR CDRCDR CDR CDR CDR CDR CDR"
4,Lindas!!!,"Las invitaciones son muy lindas y coloridad, sin embargo se requiere de un boligrafo un tanto especial para poder escribir en ellas."
4,Pixarcar: Sally,"This car was sold out at Disney stores and everywhere I looked for Sally. I had bought many of the cars for my grandson but this was an important character that I couldn't find. I did find on Amazon. I payed too much on Amazon for it but I'm glad I found it. For me, to be able to add Sally to his collection, it was worth it."
4,Un buen disco ...,Posee algunas reminiscencias que asemejan al sonido que tuvo Voyage en algun momento. Un disco muy interesante para los que gustan del buen dancing ...
1,It was a CD-R,BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU BUY A CD FROM ''HOT PRODUCTION'' ALWAYS CHECK THE CENTER THIS MY THIRD CD FROM THEM THAT IS A CD-R (FUN FUN AND DIVINE WERE THE OTHER TWO) I DON'T BLAME THE SELLERS BECAUSE I GOT THEM FROM 3 DIFFERENT ONES BUT THE DISTRIBUTORS ARE RESPONSIBLE 'HOT PRODUCTION' DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE.
2,Misintrpretations and unsupportable conclusions,"Dr. Lowry does an excellent job discussing the diseases and treatments of syphilis and gonorrhea and that alone makes the book worth buying. However with about 20 entries of venereal diseases in the journals he manages to misinterpret some of the entries, provides misleading information and some of his conclusions are not suportable by the entries in the journals.J.W.F.author ""Medical Appendices of the Lewis and Clark Expedition"""
4,"Compact, easy to use, does a lot more than basic.","I needed a compact Webcam for my laptop. I found it easy to use. I followed written instructions, installed the disk, before plugging the webcam, was very easy to use. I have not figured out how to make a video to attach with an e-mail, I wish the manual had more than basic intstruction as this is capable of doing much more. I need help to do more advance uses . I did purchase it for basic use, but this does more than that, It is an excellent product. I just have not figured out how to do it all. That is why I gave it only 4 out of 5 stars. Met my basic needs, now want more."
2,This is for video only - you need a microphone,"I was surprised when I got this product. It IS for video ONLY.All Logitech webcams I used before come with an integrated microphone. This one does need a separate microphone to talk through the net.There is a tiny microphone in the package though, but I am really uncomfortable to hang it on my ear when I need to talk. You may need to purchase a bigger microphone to free your ear up."
1,"Failed to install, had to return.","I should have checked the Creative Labs web site first. After I tried and failed several times to install this web cam to my notebook computer (even with the Creative Labs tech support), I checked their discussion forum to learn that this is a wide-spread problem. There is some design flaw with the camera or the drivers and there appears to be a large number of notebook makes and models that do not recognize the device when you plug it into the USB port."
3,Time is Money,"First I'm not going to repeat what the other reviewers had said. The camera works fine, but it gets a little hot, I'm using Windows XP Pro SP2 and 1GB of RAM and when I run the software (Creative WebCam Center) always stops responding for half a minute or so and then starts to work, I'm sure with an update this problem could be solve (the version of the software is the same since June 2005).Don't expect the USB 2.0 to work wonders it is the same as other cameras the only difference is when you are using broadband connection and broadcasting you are able to send images in super WebCam.A cool face tracking utility is included in the software. The auto adjust image works fine with poor light as well as the opposite.The last thing is that Creative takes a loooonnnng time to send your rebate."
3,Webcam,I was a little bit disappointed because the ads in the internet says that it is compatible with Windows Vista but it was not. I have to call the support right away to get the latest driver.
3,"Missing video effects, not so easy to clip to notebook",If you want video effects don't buy this model.Not so easy to clip to notebook.
4,gr8 cam,the cam is gr8.. very easy to install and use...very nice display and picture clarity is amazing...also it comes with a free head phone.. which are great..
1,is this for notebook? kidding,"i dont want to write about this awful webcam. it says it is for notebook, but it does not work with it at all(dv8305us)go to creative official website's forum you will see what i mean"
3,Cute but not great in visible quality,This webcam is very cute in size and display. But the quality of screaming is not that much great that I have expected. More over be careful about creative rebates. May be they can say that your barcode is not valid with out showing any reason. It could be amazon fault/creative negligence.
5,The Best WebCam On The Market,I had several webcams and this webcam is the best so far. It produces a very sharp image when using Windows Messenger. The price is a little too high but it is worth it.Enjoy the WebCam....
1,Worst Webcam ever,This is the worst webcam I ever tried. The Driver does not install at all and gives error on HP laptop. So folks if you have HP then DO NOT BUY this.
1,Couldn't even get it to work.,"I have a brandnew laptop, and I could not get this thing to work at all. I exchanged it once already, and the replacement doesn't even work. Creative Customer Service is of absolutely no help. It's odd to look at the reviews and see that about 50% of people who have bought this product have had problems with it. DO NOT BUY! Look elsewhere for a webcam."
1,Mulfunction,"I'm using windows XP Sp2 and i had install the software as the instruction, but when i pluged it to usb port there was error message apear that says ""...windows can not recognize the device.."" Eventhough i already unistall and re install many times also with the brand new exchange from the seller still not working."
1,Does not work with multiple laptops,Go check out Creative's discussion forums in their support area and do a search on Toshiba. Myself and many others have Toshiba laptops that these do not work with. I have contacted support with no assistanced given whatsoever. In fact they have told multiple people to go get a powered USB adapter.. this totally defeats the purpose of a laptop camera. I have other Creative webcams that work fine without that hassle on this laptop. It is this model thats sucks. (...)
1,Not Windows 7 Compatible,Tried to install on a Windows 7 computer but windows was unable to locate a driver. No drivers are available from the Creative Labs website for Windows 7 as the product is discontinued. Drivers are for Windows XP and older only.
4,Easy to set up,I found this very easy to set up and get started. The quality of image isn't great and you want to make sure there's plenty of light available or it really gets dark.
2,Be careful with Windows Vista,"After I purchased Live Ultra Notebook for someone else, I found that the webcam has no driver for Windows Vista. On the Creative web site, it is said that no development is planed for Live Ultra Notebook.The camera works well on Windows XP, but it doesn't sound right to me for Creative to sell this webcam and not to provide a Vista driver."
2,Beware - Not for Windows Vista OS,"This camera produces unpredictable results under Vista. Sadly, they are the type you can spend much time diagnosing and attributing to something you may have done incorrectly, e.g. loading the wrong driver, not having settings for a video application specified correctly, etc. Creative Support provides a generic response that says ""if you go to...you will find a Vista driver..."" (beta since Oct 2007.) It will not work correctly, at least not on the two brands of notebooks I installed on.When I installed on a Windows XP desktop, it functioned properly. However, unless you can buy at a steep discount (Creative offered for $20 recently), my recommendation would be to spend a couple of dollars more and get newer technology, auto-focusing lens, higher resolution, light sensing and adjustment, etc."
3,Good for small company LANs and desktop support pros,"This book is an uneven collection of articles, tips and techniques that is more applicable to a PC-centric computing and desktop office automation. It's a great resource for small companies or workgroup administrators, but is a bit too light for enterprise-wide security. If you are the LAN administrator for a small company that uses consumer operating systems and applications, such as Microsoft's Windows family, you will find this book to be an invaluable source of information. If you are responsible for security in a larger multi-platform enterprise, especially one that spans multiple locations and is dependent upon business-critical applications and e-commerce or ERP suites, you will probably find this book too lite and not slanted towards the issues that you need to address. If you call into the latter group I strongly recommend CERT Guide to System and Network Security Practices by Julia Allen."
4,Good Live CD,"If you enjoyed Mann's ""Live at the Village Gate"", this would be an excellent choice. As with most jazz musicians, his brilliance shows with a live performance."
4,Fun toy,"These are a good toy. They are extremely strong magnets and the coating conducts electricity well. They will break from being dropped on tile but still pretty durable. The smaller magnets do not fit inside the next-size-up hollow magnets unless you force them, in which case they will get stuck. I was hoping they could move freely through the center of the other magnets but was disappointed. The picture is a good representation so be sure you realize how small they are. Tons of fun to play with and work quite well for science experiments."
2,a nice try,"Though he interviewed many people and has done conciderable research, it is clear he has little understanding of the Middle East.He has a score to settle, maybe with himself, but too many people seem prone to this on this topic...alas. There seems to be quite a mistery surrounding the author. He was not part of the negotiating team, nor present in any respect to the negotiations. He seems to have lied to many of the people he interviewed as to the intent of his work. And the whole issue of Gabe Ross working covertly for his father on capital hill while 18 and a mail clerk seems just plain stupid.It is a worth while read for some of the facts and opinions, not all groundless, but over all one should not attempt to 'understand' the process of Final Status Negotiations through this book"
2,Mr. Swisher has a moral problem.,"The author lacks of moral clarity in the issue of the Middle East. It seems that the only democracy in that region has the fault of everything. As Mr. Sharansky explain in his last book, ""The power of Democracy....."", there is at least two ways to know when something is anti-Semitic. 1) when someone compare attitudes as diabolic. Ej: compare Israel politics as Nazis, or the way Israelis treats Palestinian as Auschwitz (Saramago). 2) when someone like Mr. Swisher critics the attitudes of a Nation o people, but says nothing about the same attitude in others country or people. It seems in these books, that Palestinian terror does not exist, that suicide terrorist take places in another planet.And yes, despite the many interviews he made, witch are interesting in many cases, this book is anti-Semitic and anti Israel, with no sustainable bases."
3,Camp David II - Re-visited,I think what happened at Camp David II is somewhere between this book and Dennis Ross' book (missing peace). I liked the interviews and the more neutral narrative tone compared to other books on this topic.
2,Domino falls flat,"This novel is rich with historical and period detail and many of the passages in the book are beautifully written. There are also some very funny scenes throughtout. Yet it is a difficult story to follow and many aspects of it are just implausible. It really lacks a plot and never solves the mystery. If you love historical fiction then this book might hold your interest, but much of the book just does not make sense."
2,A Great Disappointment,"I really wanted to like this book. I am a great fan of historical fiction and have enjoyed some of Ross King's later books, particularly ""Michaelangelo and The Pope's Ceiling"". I struggled through to the middle of ""Domino"" before I finally gave up on it, deciding that there are too many other good books to waste anymore time on this one.The major flaw in ""Domino"" is that there is not a single likeable character in the story. Neither is there someone despicable enough to hold the reader's attention. In this, his first book, Ross King doesn't give the reader any reason to care about the fate of the characters. The supposed mystery is a Domino itself - a trumped up, unimportant story masquerading as a fascinating life story that is not even interesting.I recommend that if you like Ross King, read his later books. He seems to have developed a lot after this one."
3,"Beautiful language, but ponderous pacing","Lushly written by a writer who has clearly done their research. The descriptive passages rival those of Suskind's PERFUME, and the story is beautifully structured, the character's well drawn. So why, then, didn't I like this book more? I suspect it might be a question of pacing. I found it a little ponderous, at times more concerned with displaying its own knowledge than telling the story. Still, for fans of the period, I can easily recommend it."
4,Wright done right.,"Vastly superior to the Ken Burns DVD on Frank Lloyd Wright in every way. You will come away from this learning a great deal about Wright's style based on three concrete examples, including his own residence outside Chicago. The only downside is that the 50 minute running time of the video does not leave time to tour more of the buildings for which Wright was responsible. For that, there are plenty of books out there that cover the subject. If you are more interested in Wright's personal excesses, get the Burns DVD. Otherwise, this is where you want to start."
4,"If you've only seen still photographs, you're in for a treat","For someone who's never seen any of Frank Lloyd Wright's domestic architecture other than in books, this video is something of a revelation.Although the video mainly discusses the architect's life and how his philosophy of architecture may be seen in his own homes (the Oak Park house, near Chicago; Taliesin in Wisconsin and Taliesin West in Arizona), it's been an eye-opener for me to see the delicate quality of some of his leadlighting, the way the houses might 'feel' when you first enter them... and the wonderful sense of space he was able to achieve.Seeing this video has only increased my resolve to see the real houses... I just *know* that it will truly be awe-inspiring when I do."
2,Balls are limp,I have a 4 and 8 year old boy. We throw these around in the basement. Some of them bounce really nice the majority of others do not. I have a gut feeling they are rejects or something that did not quite make it past quality control. The boys like them so that is all that really matters but take note most of them are duds and not considered superballs in my opinion.
5,NOT RIGHT SIZE,AMOUNT WAS GOOD JUST TO SMALL. TRYING TO FILL LARGE PIRATE TREASURE CHEST AND THIS WILL ONLY COVER THE BOTTOM. NOT YOUR FAULT SIZE IS TO SMALL
4,Bouncy Balls,"Play a lot of board marble games. Bought 27mm different colored marbles for these games,Which can get quite expensive.Saw bouncy balls in a gum ball machine at a restaurant . Went on line to find bouncy balls and found them at Amazon.They work even better then marbles for my boards. look just as good, less noisy and won't mar the board like marbles."
5,For parades,We bought these to throw at parades rather than candy. The kids absolutely love them - we just have to be careful that we not allow them to bounce back into the parade route -- we don't want children running out to get them.
1,PowerFinder,"Ordering this product has been a disappointment. It's disturbing to pay and not get an instruction booklet and have to tab through advertisements to get into the program.Yes you can turn the ads off, but you only learn of that option after you scroll through the online help menu.Glad my company is reimbursing the money!"
5,The man rocks!!!,"This is one of those that I took a chance on...and I was not disappointed! The flow throughout the CD was jazz with a R & B funk! None of his guest artist ""mails it in"". I kept waiting for that one that I wanted to skip, and it didn't happen. If you're trying to turn a young lady on to the world of smooth jazz, put on the candles, break out the wine, and play this...it's on!!"
1,There's still time for him to write better tunes ...........,"Of all my Higher Octave albums, this is the one I'm most disappointed in. I also have the Higher Octave Smooth Grooves 3 album, which has ""Promise Me"" on it, and it fits in well. But that album also has Shilts' ""There's No Wonder"" on it. And though they are both great players, I think the difference between the two is that Shilts writes much better tunes."
3,Not that great,"I realize I'm going against the ""norm"" in regard to other reviews, but this was less than I was hoping for after reading all the other rave reviews. I don't really care for all the vocals, plus it has that Sanborn kind of sax sound in some of the songs that I never really cared for. In my experience, I took a chance and got a whimper instead of a bang. I'll listen to it in the future, but not very often. Not bad, but nothing exceptional IMO."
5,The Best Contempory Jazz CD EVER!!! ( CD 101.9 lovers),"I bought this CD only hearing two songs while browsing CD's at Coconuts. Not knowing anything about the man or his talent, I bought it and haven't been disappointed yet.Sommers combines his talent with the likes of Coolio, Eric Benet, Ginuwine and many more. His Urban groove is the very embodiment of contemporary-upbeat-savvy-sultry jazz with all its flares and cares. It'll leave you humming for hours but its never loud and obnoxious. It all, its purrrfect.It the only Jazz CD you need. Period...."
4,Harsh but realistic,"This woman's diary was very hard to read because I could relate to so much she has experienced. Despite the book's bitter reality it was comforting to know that there are certainly more people out there (other than myself) that are not daunted by the task of finding love despite all the bad experieinces. Learning from experience whether it is from other people or myself is very valuable. I suggest this to all dumpers and dumpies, men and women...it gives perspective of what's going on with the ""other side"". Beth, thanks for sharing your thoughts and keeping them real!"
1,Self-Serving and Rediculous,"Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time. If you really want to read about the terrible, poor choices that some women make, go to the library and read The Star or The National Enquirer. This book makes those look good."
1,"Me, me, me. It's all about me.","I was so disappointed in this one-dimensional, shallow tale of this woman's failed relationships. I experience her as self-important and superficial. Anyone hoping to learn from Miss Elias' mistakes is in serious trouble. Perhaps she could get a job working with the poor women on ABC's ""The Bachelor"", though. That seems about the depth of her so-called advice. Don't waste your money."
3,Not quite right,"The hitch cover (faceplate) itself is really good. However, the mount holes (class III hitch) were not in the correct location, so I had to omit the weather gasket. This is OK for me in Az, but may not be so good for those who actually experience weather. This could be solved by getting longer screws to mount the bracket to the face plate and putting a few washers to move that face place out from the mounting bracket, but really for $50 you just expect things to fit."
3,Pretty clock - stopped working!,"I purchased this clock as a holiday gift for my husband. He had it in his office, and very much liked the way it looked. However, it has been about 10 months since purchase, and the clock no longer works. We've replaced the battery twice, so I think we just got a lemon. I am surprised, given that it is a Seiko."
5,Captivating,"I found Caryn Suarez' story captivating, a good read, and something I couldn't put down once I started reading. How easily we picture our friends and neighbors as 'typical,' and yet does anyone ever know what really goes on behind closed doors ? A book I recommend to anyone who wants to read about the hidden truths in small town USA."
4,This is a book that brings the past to life!,"""Living Crazy Like Fly"" opens many closet doors. Although the things that come out may not all be pleasent, they do hit home. Your heart goes out to the author, who lived through these times and still perservered. This book draws you from one chapter to the next.Easy to read, but hard to put down. Highly recommended for anyone who really wants to know ""the way it was""!"
2,A bit thin in size,"The Cambridge Latin Course is proving to be an excellant way of quickly learning to read latin. While the student book is full of extra background material and short witty, interesting stories I find the teachers manual not up to par with the text.The teachers manuals for the first two units of Cambridge Latin are a bit thin in size and material, something that is corrected in the one for the Third unit. Think of a grape sitting next to a grapefruit in size. And reading the contents of a postcard compared to reading a Stephen King tome.While better than nothing the guide to the first unit really could stand to be beefed up."
3,"Beautifully illustrated, poorly translated","The Connie is a classic airliner with wonderful lines. This book is an exhaustive overview of the many civilian and military variants. It features dozens of side illustrations depicting the various liveries. And it has a lot of great photographs. Unfortunately, the text has been badly translated from the French. You can generally understand it, but it takes a lot of work to read it. They really needed an editor to clean up the text. It's too bad, because without that flaw, this would be a wonderful book."
4,Lockheed Constellation,"Could not put the book down once I received it. Having worked on some of those models in the military, it`s a pretty good accounting of the Connie. Photos are superb, the prints are great in their detail. Nice read."
5,Wonderful book,This book is a gold mine of information on antique combs and purses. This author has a book on just beaded purses which is wonderful too.
2,"Interesting premise, but story falls flat","The premise of the chemical soldier was really promising for this novel. But the story just really didn't go anywhere. There were a lot of great descriptions of life in the south, but how did that tie in with the story? And the love story between Stone and Jasmine... completely unbelieveable. The last 50 pages started to pick up but then the story ended abruptly. Overall, disappointing."
1,"Interesting story, poorly executed","The editor of this book should be taken out back and shot. All the internal monologue on consciousness could have been eliminated, not to mention the persistent spelling and grammar errors the average Microsoft Word spell check could have caught."
2,"2200mg, 400 caplets?","I've been using BCAA for a while as a recommendation from my doctor (not for body building). I ordered this brand the last time, and when I received it, I wondered who the hell did the labeling for this. Yes, it is 2200mg per serving .. but they don't bother mentioning that it's 2 per serving, so it's effectively 1100mg per caplet.I'm switching back to the BCAA from Optimum Nutrition (which was what my doctor carried)"
1,performance went down,I tried this product to see if it actually improved performance and found it caused performance and strength to go down instead of up.
2,Nothing impressive,"So, i purchased this product last winter...(just decided to write some reviews now , cuz i felt like it) ... i never used the whole thing(400caps) i used 150 i'd say ... i never say any big difference .. I used it in combination with Protein and Energy booster ... it was the same with the Dymatize BCAA and without ..I dont think I will purchase this again , .. or maybe I`ll try different brand ..."
3,"Well-constructed, but...","First off, I ordered the wrong size, which is my fault. However, if you want any sort of wrist support, these gloves are not for you. Schiek products are the best that I know of, but I'm definitely going to spend a few extra $s and get a better model."
4,Ideal when it works,"I too have experienced some problems with rechargeable batteries needing frequent swapping after a while, to the point of real inconvenience. After a couple years one of the letter keys seemed to start sending its signal almost constantly (perhaps something got caught under membrane).That said, I'm *still* looking to replace it with another! I've never found another keyboard that I love to use as much. The compactness helps to keep mouse/trackball close, and the quiet responsiveness is almost as good as my built-in PowerBook keyboard, and better than any desktop keyboard I've experienced.I hope Gyration continues to improve the reliability of this otherwise very well-engineered keyboard."
2,Gryation Keyboard,"The first one did not work at all out of the box and had to be returned. The second one worked great, lasted about 7 months and now it acts like there is a stuck key, the letter ""a"" and I've rarely used it.Now it needs to be replaced.Overall, when it works, it's great. Problem seems to be one of reliability."
5,So far the best,"I have been in R/C for quite a while an the Dynamite drivers are by far the best I have had. They have a good weight and feel, mot to mention the durability and price."
3,Jane Eyre,I know this movie very well so I was very disappointed that it skips during an important scene. I emailed Amazon about this problem and have not been contacted about it. I am very disappointed in your customer service. I would like to know if I can exchange this disc for one that does not skip please.
1,Jane Eyre - Echo Bridge version - DVD,I agree with the other reviews - the quality is poor and scenes are missing. My VHS copy that I taped from TV is better than this version.
1,Bad copy!!!,"Do not buy this version of Jane Eyre. The dvd is awful. Sound is horrible, picture even worse, big pieces of some of the scenes are missing. This was such a good production when it aired, why cannot a company ""remaster"" it to dvd properly? Not worth wasting your money to buy this version.MEH"
1,junk,total waste of time. I devoted 2 minutes to it and lots of fast forward. from the first moment i could tell it's junk........
1,"If I could give this minus 5 stars, I'd give it a minus 10","This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre there. Not only do the characters not look anything like they should, but George C. Scott pretending to be British??? Please, give me a break!!! Run, don't walk, as far away from this version as possible."
2,Great film - Bad DVD!,"I was so excited to see that this wonderful made-for-tv movie had been released on DVD. What a horrible shock it was to see that the print the DVD was created from was in terrible condition. Whole scenes are missing. The dialog jumps around. The screen goes completely black in the middle of a scene for a good three seconds. There are scratch lines throughout the film.The ""original"" film itself I give 5 stars (from memory). The DVD -- doesn't deserve a single star. Shame on the production company for not remastering this brilliant film.If you love Jane Eyre, these performances in this are well worth watching, but find a different copy."
1,Disappointing-frustrating-enraging,"Not the orignial tv version I recall. Edited,hacked,half of the novel left out, so parts didn't even make logical sense. When searching for this dvd I read most of the reviews but when I saw this had George C. Scott I recalled this as the one I was searching for and obivously didn't read the reviews. Never imagined someone would butcher the original sooo badly!"
1,Jane Eyre - Such a disappointment,"As a fan of the Bronte sister's writings and of George C.Scott's performances, it was a wonderful delight to see that the made-for-TV movie was actually on DVD. As delighted as I was to find the movie, is as disappointed at watching this DVD. The editing butchers the story line, complete chapters are missing, dialogue that moves the story along is omitted and it seems like miniplays with no connection but the characters. DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION. IT IS NOT WORTH EVEN A PENNY."
1,The Absolute Worst Edited Copy Ever!,"Jane Eyre Starring George C. Scott and Susannah York has all the potential of being an excellent movie. I truly believe that if the ORIGINAL UNEDITED version were allowed to surface and produced by a reputable company, this would be a 5 star movie. If George C. Scott knew what this Farce of a reproduction company has done to this movie, he would surely turn over in his grave, rise up and haunt the dickens out of them!"
1,disapointed,I was at first happy to see that it was available.But I was very disappointed in the quality.I would have wanted to know that it was a really badreplica of the oringinal. The price should have given.that away. Only when I got it and started to watch didit say that it was a copy and that its quality was a reflectionof the orginal that it was copied from. It was so bad thatthere was missed conversation in important parts from skipesand stops in the DVD.
2,Is this the best they can offer the Riot Grrrl scene?,"The interviews were good. But, the documentary was poorly put together. Outside the few live performance videos, there wasn't much music. There wasn't much art. It was incredibly short. In the end, it was just very empty."
3,Where's Huggy Bear??,"Well the dvd is good as far as the history of riot grrrl goes, but it left out a lot of important people. I would have also liked to see some full concert coverage as well as riot grrrl in England. Huggy Bear was my favorite grrrl band!!"
3,Great idea but not so great recipes,"I love the idea of this cookbook! I am not much of a cook and when I want to cook my cupboards are not filled with many ingredients required for most recipes. This cookbook seemed perfect for me.When I got the cookbook home, I immediately tried the dishes. For a few weeks I cooked, cooked and cooked but was never happy with the outcome. Most of the recipes lacked flavor... I ended up adding my own spices (I enjoy more flavorful meals). One recipe for an artichoke appetizer actually tasted more like an omelet than a cracker spread. I suppose that with only four ingredients per recipe I should not expect Martha Stewert taste. Needless to say, I switched back to my more complex cookbooks where the taste was much more appreciated."
5,Four Ingredient Cookbook,"I found this cookbook a wonderful resource for quick meals and a break from my standards. The recipes are quick and easy. You can eliminate ingredients for the picky eater or add to make them suitable for your own tastes. This is not french cooking, so don't expect that. What this is, is a great way to serve a variety of quick simple meals."
1,letdown,"this book looked good but lacks alot. it has no soup ,pasta,or breakfast recipes. i only found a few chiken ones that sounded good. the spanish hamburger was awful. it s beef ,chili and toamto soup. i made the cherry chiken that called for cooking sherry but i do not use that and dont drink so i subsituted it for chicken broth. it did not taste like cherrys.big dissapointment"
1,"Good concept, bad execution","If you like powdered soup mix, Velveeta, and Cool Whip, this book is a good choice. Otherwise, the busy are better off coming up with creative ways to liven up simple meals on their own."
4,Good for the lazy cook.,This cookbook is good/great for the lazy cook like me and also for one with no time to cook. After I got one I order one for two of my granddaughters who are able to start cooking.
2,Not as described,"I paid for a new cookbook but when it arrived, it had obviously been used and the binding was partially broken."
2,Plastic binding broken-book outdated,The Four Ingredient Cookbook arrived with the binding broken which made even moving the pages difficult. In addition the book did not have any pictures or illustrations. Since I was buying this book for a 21 year old in college - I believe that the addition of pictures will motivate her to try a recipe - I know that it does to me (45 years of cooking). The table of contents was quite limiting in that it only listed category session - versus individual recipes. I gave it a 2 stars because some of the recipes look interesting. The book needs to be reviewed to make it more eye appealing and to include color pictures. Since then I bought another 4 ingredients cookbook with lovely illustrations and the receiver is very pleased!
4,Nothing Like Cons EV Pro II,"Just when you thought the world's oldest athletic shoe was poised to kick it...Converse returns with a retro-line of classic Cons that harken back to mid-70's original leather court shoes.Today's Converse look like their original counterparts, but they're a lot lighter than the first generation. They also seem to be a made of a slightly different leather. The fit however, is classic converse and the style is as hip today as it was way back in days of Dr. J and Magic.If you wore the originals...the EV Pros are for you!"
3,Limited interest,"Mainly of interest to avid Waugh fans or scholars. These are juvenilia in which some seeds of the later Evelyn Waugh can be seen. Some of the short stories are amusing in the way of Saki or Roald Dahl, with ironic twists in the tail,sharp satire, and dark humor. The longer title story could be read as autobiographical. You'd need to be familiar with the terminology of English boarding schools to understand some of it. It seems unfinished."
4,Brideshead Revisited fans will want to read the title story,"The title story in this collection will be of interest to those who found Brideshead Revisited a good book. It won't make you any clearer on the difficult Mr. Ryder, who is as muddled and vindicative a teenager as any of us, but it is a good sort of Prologue to Brideshead. Of course it's available in the Complete Stories of E.W. as well."
4,great book for true poetry fans,"Rhonda Moats, Author of My Anchor in this Dark Sea, shows a wide array of emotions throughout the book. She shares her innermost feelings of despair, sorrow, and also there are threads of happiness and faith woven into this compilation of poetry. She lets her faith guide her across the seas of emotion. I really enjoyed this compilation, and anyone who likes poetry will enjoy this collection. I'm looking forward to future works from her."
5,Little Giant. . . Vade Mecum,"The second edition of this book was my security vade mecum for the last 8 years. For what I can foresee, this third edition, will play the same role for (at least) the next three years.When you are required as an security expert, several tasks are usually to be faced:New scenarios to analyze?, checklists to recommend?, good firewall architectures to suggest?, logs to watch? (and so on). Don't worry, with the only help of this Garfinkel, Spafford and Schwartz 'little giant' book, you are done.Excellent book. A Must for security people."
2,outdated and light on internet security,"I should have paid more attention when I bought this book in a series of security books and I regret this buy. Its ""best seller"" position is IMO unjustified because the networking/internet sections (10 total lines on SSL!, mentions of Netscape 2.0b2, nothing on ICMPs attacks, 3 lines about spoofing...) are completly outdated and/or pretty useless."
2,Sub Par Performance from a Sub Par Author,"the book contains little to no information that any intro security book hasnt already covered, the author of the UNIX Hater's book is definately showing his general dis interest in security for unix ... why he wrote this book is beyond me ... to sum up: dont waste 30-odd dollars for this .. if ya see another security book on the shelf .. try it cant be much worse"
2,Order a wrong edition,"I saw that there is a bargain of another paperback edition on the page of 3rd edition, so I didn't recheck whether it is 3rd edition. So I end up in buying 2 books, 2nd and 3rd editions, because I need the 3rd edition for my class. It would be better to put edition number up in the page, not only paperback or library binding!"
5,No better Unix/Internet security book exists...,"Sure, it's a bit dated, but it's still the best book on this subject. It doesn't go into as much depth in certain areas as other books might (e.g., ""Building Internet Firewalls, 2nd Edition"", By Elizabeth D. Zwicky, Simon Cooper & D. Brent Chapman, published by O'Reilly & Assoc.), but then it covers a much broader array of subjects.If you're a Unix admin but your primary job is not Security, then this probably needs to be one of your core books on your bookshelf. If you are a Security admin, then this book should be the core of a whole collection of books you need."
4,Excellent book for those securing any TCP/IP network,"This book covers a wide range of topics regarding internet security. For *NIX admins, a very good source of information about securing your network against the outside. For other Non-*NIX people, still very worth while for the coverage about securing TCP/IP networks in general, and understanding the various implications of running certain internet services."
2,Not As Good as I'd Hoped,"I bought this book in 1996. I agree with several other reviews, it is 935 pages of mostly fluff and common knowledge. The authors seem to have a particularly high opinion of themselves."
3,Disappointing,"Had this book cost me $5, I would've been perfectly happy with it, but for over $30... These people have written a lot, but said little. They did mention a few things to watch out for, but this could've been fit in under 50 pages. The rest is reiteration of trivial. Some topics, like cryptography, were a bait, but haven't been covered in depth. And, boy, about a third of the book talks about stuff from intro UNIX texts. I tend to think that people concerned with UNIX security know how to move between directories.Also worth knowing that Garfinkel co-authored so called ""UNIX haters notebook"". His prejudice shows."
4,Not as good as Happy Thoughts,"Tosh is my favorite current comedian and his material almost always fails to disappoint. This is no exception. He's very witty and there's a lot to gather from his jokes even with a couple viewings. He's pretty mean for the average person, though.Watch Tosh.0 a few times to get a feel for his comedy. I have found his stand up has traditionally funnier than his stand up but I found ""Happy Thoughts"" to be about on par with some of the funnier Tosh.0 episodes. ""Completely Serious"" is his best in my opinion but this is also some good comedy at a decent price."
2,$10 bucks!? Should be $5.,"Louis C.K. and Aziz Ansari had their stand-ups available for $5 bucks... please don't pay $10 to see this. I am sure it is good, but lets try to create a standard pricing system of a more friendly $5 bucks :)**I have not seen this yet, waiting for price to drop.**"
1,Avoid the Bescol set!,"I can't believe this is still around. This set on the Bescol label is the poster child for what not to do when you release beautiful old recordings. It is terrible from beginning to end. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money and time on the Bescol set.The recordings themselves actually sounded very good when they were made, and they are wonderful performances. Look around and you can find these same recordings in much better presentations than this Bescol travesty."
3,tape changed speeds in digital transfer,"I want to make people aware that in Eroica, the first movement, around 1:19 into the song, the entire pitch of the symphony changes because the magnetic tape reel used for the digital recording slowed down ahaha...it is kind of funny. But I am kind of surprised this recording was released, and the publisher ""Bescol Studios"". I guess people do not even bother to listen to the recording anymore. That is funny to hear. I am surprised that there is not a more recent quality recording available of the London Symphony for Beethoven's 9 Symphonies at low cost to the general public."
3,"Listen to the Performance, not the Recording","I think M.A.Scott must have let his dissatisfaction with the sound quality cloud his artistic judgement. The sound is quite tolerable and certainly better than anything we get in recordings by Pfitzner, Furtwangler or Weingartner - would he dismiss those out of hand? Setting aside the sound, I don't understand how he can be so dismissive of Krip's performances: to me they sound as though the conductor has taken his Viennese style and rethought it. These performances are very, very Viennese: witty, urbane, wise and unforced - they present the music, not the conductor. Mr Scott recommends four Karajan cycles. I have heard two, and attended several performances by him; they told me more about Karajan than they did about Beethoven."
3,Home Sweet Home is Lip-Synced,"The songs on this DVD are all wonderful and I enjoyed the interviews; however, it was a big disappointment to realize that all of the songs are lip-synced. They do a pretty good job of it though, as there are only a few places where you notice it a lot. I prefer live performances, so this DVD was disappointing for the lip-syncing reason. That said, I still love hearing and seeing the Lewis Family!"
5,"Have to agree with the five star reviewers,","There are some pretty bored and misinformed people posting on this board. Obviously, despite their raging, bashing and claimsof being tax lien investors, their reviews spew out totally unsubstantiated comments, and these people don't know beans about tax liens.Tax liens are among the safest and most profitable ways to make money. SAFER & MORE profitable than playing the stock market. You can make up to 50% rates of return in some states. One caveat; beware of land in certain areas and research the liens that you are going to buy.Tax liens are profitable, safe and fun. Disregard the 1 star reviewers on this great investment and this great book. Sure it was written back in the early 90's, but not that much has changed. This isn't like personal finance or tax strategies which change almost constantly.The 16% Solution is a great way to learn how to invest in tax liens and I recommend it."
3,Good for Basic Information,"This is one of the books that I keep in my library, probably because when I bought it five years ago, it was the only book available about tax liens. Even though it's a newer addition then when it was first written, it's still dated and now there are other books available that are more complete. It's a good book for basic information about tax liens in the most popular tax lien states. Don't buy it if your interested in tax deeds, it has no information about tax deed states. Because state laws constantly change some of the information is no longer relevant."
4,Informative,A lot of information but a very good read!!! I hope to begin earning 16% soon. The author offers excellent advise.
3,ehhhh...,Good if you are in one of the states the book has a chapter about. The book is not as good otherwise. Still informative about different ways tax lien auctions are performed.
2,Book incomplete; excludes tax collectors' addresses.,"Recently purchased book; found it lacking the addresses of states' county tax collectors which is the real information needed to start the process. Also missing is information on several states: i.e. Alaska and Texas, the two states of interest to me. Book gives telephone numbers of county tax collectors; however, to call could mean a fortune in telehone calls to just obtain addresses and information. Suppose caller is put on hold or encounters one of those automatic phone systems that have a myriad of directions and options? I am returning book for refund, as it does not meet my needs."
3,good news bad news,"This book happens to be an informative intro into tax lien investing. Very good for beginers. It gives some great rules on does and dont's. The bad news is it is outdated and doesn't mention that most auctions are controled by banks and institutions willing to buy liens at VERY low interest rates. I attended Nassau CTY NY auction today (2/18/03) and the avg rate was 1.75%. Most bidding/winners were banks!. Don't get too excited. I wish the book had a 2003 version...not the one which discusses the ""current"" (haha) S&L failures!!!!"
4,Pretty good book,Well-written book and has good information. I only wish there was a little more detail in some areas. Most of the topics are covered pretty quickly.
4,good basic training manual,"Very good for folks new to tax liens. All the basics and some good resource lists, too."
4,The 16% solution,"This was a good book into the introduction of Tax Lien investing. However, I would highly consider reading more on the subject before you start. This book paints a very broad picture of the topic at hand.It was very easy to read and easy to understand the topics presented."
2,The 16% Solution,This will get you started but it has only scratched the surface of what you really need to do regarding the tax lien certificate process. I think this book is best for gauging your interest level to see if you want to explore further.
3,A view from the sterling area,"This book is specific to US. It woudl be difficult to work the system from outside US.I phoned a number of local councils and found that they all had one auction per year. In these days of low interest rates, there was no debt left over.For Californians who are happy to be in a sinking dollar, a better alternative is to lend to individuals against their property. There are many brokers will get you 14% secured against the whole property, and you are not tied to one auction a year.Nevertheless, it is an excellent and well-written book. The seciton giving details of who to phone was correct when I used it. I learned a lot."
2,I would not buy this book...,"Serious investors in tax liens should not buy this book. The first half of the book is basically wasted space on why tax liens are better than stocks and bonds...the information is wrong and in some cases just plain silly. People who read this book want to know about tax liens, and presumably can get their stock and bond investment advice from a professional in that area. Second, this book paints a highly unrealistic view of how much can be earned from investing in tax liens. At best, this book will serve as an introduction to the basics of tax lien investing, but I'm sure there are better ways to get that information."
2,The 16% Solution How To Get Interest Rates by Joel Moskowitz,"An official Library Weekly book review.EXCERPT:If you are like most people, you are struggling, without much success, to get the yield backinto your savings. The places to which you are turning are not producing much relief.RATING:2 of 5REVIEW:The 16% Solution is supposed to be a guide on how to invest in tax liens; however, as youturn the pages, you find that it seems to cut back and forth with fictional characters andthen law-based jargon. There is an attempt by the author to deliver a point, which iscommendable, but there are many parts of the book that needs editing. While this is anacceptable guide to investing in tax lien certificates, it would not be a first pick.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS:1. The Beginner's Guide to Real Estate Tax Lien and Tax Deed Auctions [ISBN 0978834607 at other online bookstores]2. Profit by Investing in Real Estate Tax Liens [ISBN 0793195179]"
4,A Good Introduction to Tax Lien Certificate,"It is a good book for introducing a special kind of investment vehicle, Tax Lien Certificate, to the readers.However one has to be well aware of the laws in different states in order to make a good investment decision.As a foreigner, I envy the Americans their good fortune of having an opportunity to invest in this wonderful ""Certificate""."
3,an ok book,"The idea of tax liens turns out to be a lot more confusing than what other financial writers claim them to be. This book itself was confusing to me. Every state has different tax lien laws and this book attempts to take each state one by one and go through the individual state's laws. Laws change all the time, and the copywrite of this book, I believe, is 1994. This means much of the book is outdated. If you want state by state specifics of the way tax liens are handled, this book is for you. However, if you want the basics to how everything is done, then this book is pretty worthless. My advice would be to try to find an updated book on tax liens, however, if none exist, then this might be a decent book to read - as more of a specific level book."
1,outdated and not useful,This book was a giant disappointment. Very outdated - virtually no information on how to do this kind of investing electronically. A waste of $.
5,Good condition,Quick delivery from the US to UK - book in good condition for second hand - thanks ++
3,more difficult than it seems,"to begin with, if you are a small time investor (like myself) you need to live in a state that sells tax lein certificates. this way you can get to the auctions where all the ""good"" properties are snatched up.i went to AZ recently to purchase a few ""leftover"" tax leins after reading this book. it was not that easy to find/research a suitable tax lein to buy. my estimate is that it would take an average person a week in a particular county researching and driving out to look at properties. in conclusion, the 16% solution is fine if you live in one of the FEW states that actually offer them at a 16% rate of return."
2,Not much help,"Don't waste your money on this one. It was recommended by ""Rich Dad"" advisors, but doesn't tell you how to get going. And unless you live in or want to travel to one of the 29 ""lien states"" there's nothing in for you. The other states are not mentioned."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz....,"I bought this after hearing the first track, an extremely catchy tune about some lenguas rotas in a Barnes and Noble Bookstore listening station. I immediatly came home and bought it. Apparently it was a caffine-inducued late night splurge, because besides the extremely promising first track, I then found little to keep me from using this CD as a coaster.(but I haven't... so anybody interested in buying this used?)"
3,Not for those well-read in spirituality,"This is a great book....IF you're a health care worker who's relatively new to the world of incorporating spiritual principals into everyday life. It's designed to give a clinician an introduction to incorporating more compassion and spiritual prinicpals into a practice, not to delve very deeply into any particular concepts or expand on any principals in any sort of self-development sense."
3,Mendelssohn's music shines through a mediocre performance,"Even though I did not agree with many interpretative decisions that Serbescu makes on this recording, I am really grateful to her for making this recording at all, because of the scarcity of recordings of Mendelssohn-Hensel's works. I found the c minor sonata to be ambitious, but rather uninteresting as a whole. The G minor sonata, on the other hand, displays some highly imaginative and innovative writing for the piano. Fanny Mendelssohn is obviously influenced by Beethoven and her brother Felix in this forward-looking work. It is to be played with no breaks between movements, looking forward to the great Liszt Sonata. The performance of these pieces is at times stilted and dry. I would call it almost boring, as Serbescu makes little effort to change the character of the repetitions of the rondo movement of the G minor sonata. In all, this CD is worth buying just to hear some rarely performed, but very good music."
4,Great product but breaks if you don't clean it religiously.,"As an illustrator, this serves as an valuable tool in my arsenal of pens and brushes. It's my go to toy when starting a new project. But with that being said, I'm already looking to buy a third one within a year and a half. Now perhaps the blame is on me for not cleaning it weekly, but I feel I use it often enough that it shouldn't have to be cleaned so often."
5,A terrific brush pen,"I researched all of the brush pen's on the market, and it came down to the Kuretake Sumi pen and the Pentel pen. I bought both, but I use the Kuretake brush pen almost exclusively (the Pentel is in my travel case)."
4,Nice compact ink & brush system.,"I am disappointed that Amazon is forcing me to rate this item as a toy. It is a nice, cartridge-fed ink & brush system. I am not an artist, though, so I can only say that it worked fine for my terrible drawings. Fun to use."
4,LAFF LAFF,"Very very amusing. Some performers better than others, but all very funny and worth watching again."
2,beware,"Unrated??? Series 1 was just okay and the 2 stars are only given because of the acting talents of Finney. I left my kids watching Series 2 and when I walked into the room they couldn't wait to tell me how the movie had turned 'bad'. As I watched portions of the DVD back, to my dismay, they were right. For all the suggestive sexual content, this movie should be rated PG-13 and no less. I won't even mention the drinking, 'shacking up' and carousing that goes on throughout the entire series. Very disappointed; in the future I'll be careful of movies that are rated ""unrated""."
4,Very worthwhile,"One of the problems with big, expensive appliances is that many of us underutilize them. This book will show you all the mixer can do. I now think of my Kitchenaid as a heavy duty large food processor. Also, if you are giving a Kitchenaid as a gift, include a copy of this in the box."
4,"Unconditional Love, no matter what","This is a very sweet story about a parent's unconditional love for his/her child. One of the things I like most about this story is that the parent could be mom, dad, grandparent, etc. It really fits multiple types of family situations. The story centers around characters named ""Large"" and ""Small"". Small is feeling grumpy and is wondering if Large will still love him/her even in adverse circumstances. Small goes through several 'what if' scenarios; 'what if I were a squishy bug', 'what if I were a crocodile', etc. In every scene, Large reassures Small that he/she will always love Small no matter what.We always make up silly 'what if' scenarios to make each other laugh, so this book was a huge hit in our house!I gave 4 stars. The illustrations were great, but I would have loved if this were a board book instead of an oversized hardcover. Board books are just more durable and last longer with my wild son!"
5,I love this book.,This book is amazing. It talks about relationships in a way that a child can process. It talks about repairing relationships which is something that is so valuable for children to understand. This is a wonderful book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to buy something special for a child. It is especially good for a child who is having ambivalence about a relationship.
5,Beautiful Children's Book,"I first encountered this book in a library program and fell in love. Since the characters are just named Large/Small with no genders it can be applied to any caregiver/child situation. The message about love staying even when you're far away is fantastic for families that are undergoing separation or military families. I've added this book to my list of books I love to give as a baby shower gift. I especially recommend it for military families, foster families, and anyone caring for a child in a non-traditional caregiver situation."
3,No Matter What...,"I originally purchased this book through my son's Scholastic book order. When it got ruined we needed a replacement since it was one of his favorite books. The version we recieved is very different from the one available through the Scholastic market. The text isn't the same. The version i recieved through Amazon is great for a child who has lost a parent or loved one...but not for my purpose. The words changed from ""What about when you're far away..."" to ""What about when you're dead and gone"". We have since located the Scholastic version...but be aware of the differences when you purchase this book."
5,"A wonderful story, beautifully illustrated","""No Matter What"" has a very simple message, but one that every parent needs to reinforce to their children. That their love is unconditional. Debi Gliori's illustrations are warm, vibrant and beautiful. This book is a keeper, and a great gift item."
5,Really sweet and comforting book,"I picked this book up in a book store and I have to admit tears came to my eyes. It is very sweet and especially so if you have a ""challenging"" ""spirited"" ""strong-willed"" or how ever you want to say it, child. My children really like it too, and they like to repeat the refrain ""No Matter What."" They also like to give hugs when they see the foxes doing it. My husband is annoyed by the fact the characters are called ""Big"" and ""Little"" and I did feel silly the first few times reading it, but the kids liked it, so I got over it. Plus, the illustrations are gorgeous!"
4,A suggestion for listening,"May I offer a suggestion to those who feel that the music is trite and all the same? Do not listen to this collection or any other collection (e.g. John Arpin's or Joshua Rifkin's) of ragtime in the order the pieces are recorded on the CDs, especially if you're not very familiar with ragtime. The pieces are often given chronologically or in alphabetical order. Also, don't listen to too many pieces all at once. Pick two, three, or at most four to become acquainted with first. This way you'll be able to appreciate the individual characteristics of the pieces. Try these four pieces first:1. Gladiolus Rag2. Weeping Willow3. Solace4. Magnetic RagLater you'll discover other gems on your own. When you're first getting to know ragtime, it's probably best to avoid listening to pieces that have been done to death (and often done poorly or played way too fast), like ""The Entertainer"" or ""Maple Leaf Rag."""
5,"excellent, faithful Joplin renditions","These renditions of the Joplin rags and other pieces for solo piano are not only complete, but they seem to this Jopin fan to be faithful in spirit and (for the most part) in letter to the originals. The tempos are appropriate and the amount of elaboration (always a temptation for a skilled pianist) is kept to a minimum. Thus the spirit and genius of Joplin is intact and the music is a joy for the listener. Several works that were unfamiliar to me are now on my list of Joplin sheet music to find for my own playing pleasure."
5,An excellent collection,"This is a great set of Scott Joplin's complete piano rags, and it is affordably priced to own. Joplin was an American classic, whose music was on the edge of Late 19th century classical music and early 20th century jazz. His rags were little bits of melody and beauty, and Zimmerman does an excellent job in performing them. Yes, some of the pieces do sound the same, but they quickly develop identities of their own. I would hardly hold that against any musician, as once one hears a corpus of their music, does it not sound a ""little alike""? If the whole collectin sounded the same(which it does NOT), then perhaps I would be a bit miffed but come on. Why is it that complainers complain? Could it be that they are the ones that lack musical talent completely? Perhaps because they feel inadequate..? This set is highly recommended for anyone who wants a taste of ragtime, from a true innovator in the field."
5,Available at retailers for about $18,"Excellent collection - but there are re-sellers listed here that are selling this for as much $50 or $60. Yikes, most major retailers are selling this complete set for $18 - so beware."
1,A dis-service to Joplin,"Sadly, the only virtue this set possesses is completeness.The pianist does not play Joplin's pieces ""as written"", the piano is of poor quality, and not properly in tune.This is emphatically NOT the set to buy. A far better set, beautifully annotated and well played on a good concert grand piano, is the complete works played by Guido Nielsen on the Basta Label.This set is a dis-service to Joplin and his music. He deserves better, and gets it elsewhere."
3,Not full satisfied,"The book appeared on the website is a hardcover edition, but I received some knid of copy. The seller said that the book has no more in press, so the available copies are reprints... But it did not convince me at all !!!Please clarify the real condition of the book before buy !!!"
1,Very dissappointed,Did not enjoy. It was so old fashioned in the making and was the original. It was not worth buying.
1,Does not work for me,"Acidophilus does nothing for me. I use align instead . It works much better especially when I eat the way I'm supposed to . Which is not all the time, I'm only human."
2,Biased account,"I suppose few people really care now that Lady Elizabeth Foster finally got her man. This book is nonetheless a caution to historians dependent upon family archives for primary source material. Laudatory bias is bound to creep in somewhere. As the previous reviewer noted, Bess does not come across so attractively in other biographies, even those written about Georgiana's niece, Lady Caroline Lamb. The book's positives have already been noted: good descriptions of aristocratic society and travel in the 18th century. The book is not, however, good history or even good biography."
1,Do NOT buy this book!,"I bought this one and the companion to it. They are TERRIBLE!The pictures are almost impossible to follow. Some of the hand movements do not make sense and if you don't already know the sign, you will not figure it out.Also, this is NOT ASL! this is SIGNED EXACT ENGLISH.I am so disappointed! I do not recommend these books to ANYONE."
3,"Cheap Production, Great Acting","It looks like some people here don't recognize great acting when they see it. It's a TV production,[Studio One, 1950] made in the days when all ""movies for TV"" looked like they were taking place on a stage. They probably were! Yet there are some bona fide movie stars in the production. I have seen all the filmed versions of ""Little Women"" since the first one and Kent Smith in this version is the best Professor Baer of them all. I have seen several of his Hollywood films and some are quite good but it looks like this role was the one Smith was born to play. Too bad he couldn't do it in the movies, in a production easier on the eyes. His German accent is perfect and he portrays the impoverished professor so movingly that he should have won an Emmy for it--if they had the Emmys back then. I don't know--who cares. Kent Smith is great."
5,Just the book I was looking for!,This book truely speaks to me. Especially well-written - and in such a language that stays with me once the pages have closed. It is much like my personal companion rather than simply a personal trainer. I will use this book to transform my already wonderful life to one that's totally over the top! And my daughter is getting one for Christmas. I could not wait to share the knowledge I discovered in this book. I bought three more so I'd never be without it.
3,Inspiring but...,"I read Shape magazine almost every month and I guess I expected more from the book. The graphic production is excellent and so are the sections covering spirituality, emotions and diet. It has a New Age approach and is very upbeat, inspiring and uplifting, except that... it is a contradiction to lay so much focus on the inner self when the models in the photos are so wiry, thin and flawless without. Besides, I don't find the workouts presented to be half as good as those featured monthly in the magazine, especially coming from authorities such as Rodney Yee or Karen Voight. A book that could be greatly improved."
5,My lifestyle bible!,"I love this book. It has all the information I've been looking for for the past year. The book gives you plans for everything, not just facts. In the diet section they give you a few weeks worth of menus for healthier eating with some recipes. In the other sections such as work and spirituality they continue to give you stretches and exercise ideas and relate the content back to your body.I would also like to comment on the spirituality chapter. I found it very inspiring.It is not about religion specifically and doesn't push religion at you. It is more about taking a break from our hectic, stressful, materialistic world through helping others, connecting with nature, religion, etc... I found it to be a more Zen approach rather than religious. I liked that they include spirituality because it is a reminder not to get too caught up in focusing on just your body.Overall, I find this to be a very positive book and would recommend it to anyone who wants to be healthier."
3,Not the best.,I have been using Durex brand condoms since the start of my sexual life. The Specially Ribbed for Her Pleasure are not the greatest for the male. They do serve their purpose of protecting against STDS and pregnancy but if you are looking for shared or more male pleasure use a different condom.
2,not ribbed,"36 durex her sensation condoms, specially ribbed for her pleasure--- The ones i got were not ribbed at all, they were just regulars durex."
2,Identity 6 is better,"Hmm not a whole lot to say about this one,Possibly one of the worst metal samplers i own(good thing it ony cost a few bucks).Its basically just full of mediocre bands (never more being the exception),God forbid arent too bad either but nothing special.If you like bland average metal and hardcore tunes grab it but Number 6 is a hell of a lot better."
3,Nice,I received this as a gift the first time and later purchased it myself. It's pleasant and good as a day wear. Neat for the price paid. 3 stars as the fragrance does not last long. I wish they do something about it.
2,Too bad about the band,"While this may be the best watch you ever owned, it is finished once the band splits, and the band splits long before the battery runs out. So you end up with a small clock instead of a watch."
3,Great Watch! Terrible band.,"I agree with the other reviewers. I love this watch but my band only lasted 6 months and unlike most Timex/Casio watches, this band is not replaceable. Luckily I bought it when my local Mervyn's was going out of business so I only paid about $20.Another minor complaint is that the display is dark on a light background and the backlighting only lights up the dark portions so the backlighting actually make the watch harder to read except in a very dark environment."
3,Cinderella (The Oryx Multicultural Folktale Series),I am a middle school teacher and I bought the book because the ad said there were activities appropriate for middle school grades included. While the book was a unique collection of Cinderella stories I was not pleased with the activities. My 12 and 13 year old students would have thought these activities too young for them. They need a bit more challenge.
4,Lightning Warrior,This serial shows Rin Tin Tin in his elder years. It is a must for Rin Tin Tin fans.
4,Cute with nice padding,I was attracted to this product initially because my pre-toddler was constantly falling on our hardwood floors and I thought the padding would help cushion the fall. Of course by the time I ordered it he had a better grasp on pulling up. That said I am glad we got it anyway. The pieces are a little hard for my 11 month old to get out but that doesn't stop him from trying. The bright colors keep his attention which is pretty impressive given his age. There are lots of pieces to remove so I look forward to many months (hopefully years) of use.Product was shipped quickly too!
5,A Great Dermatology Text Book,"One of the greatest dermatology text book I have ever seen .It contains very attractive clinical photographs and tables.The book is very attractive and readable with no difficulties.I am sure all the dermatologist in the world should have a copy of this amazing book.A wonderful work by great dermatologists...Jean L Bolognia, Joseph L.Jorizzo and Ronald P.RapiniAjith Kannangara,MD.Postdoctoral Research Fellow,Department of Dermatology,Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center,Winston Salem,NC, USA."
3,Ultimately disappointing,"I loved the backdrop of the novel, Chicago's tough Uptown neighborhood, and a lot of the hard-nosed adventures of the protagonist, but ultimately this book strays too far from the focus too often. The end of the book didn't have anything to do with the plight of the main character, hmmmm...Another annoying thing is that the author seems to be unintentionally preaching or being constantly moralistic throughout the book, somehow even the descriptions of objects seem to be invested with this preachiness.You'll like the writing style and storytelling if you like Nelson Algren or other hard-nosed novelists (that's what I like). As for this book, it's good but it doesn't DELIVER the goods."
3,Their is something intangible that isn't the story....,"...or Zak Mucha's words that make this book.There is something coming through heart,soul,blood,guts whatever.It makes the well tread plot and 3 chord delivery seem new and different.Either Zak Mucha is a good writer or this is a good book but I don't think it is both."
1,A wretched waste of precious time,"It would be difficult to summarize this film better than I have in the subject. Nothing happens, but along the way to nothing happening you get to spend 89 minutes with some of the most unpleasant characters ever committed to film. The main entertainment value is trying to choose which character is the least unlikeable (the prize for that goes to Thierry's girlfriend, with the neighbor Jan a distant second). The film isn't a ""meditation"", which implies a depth of thought that's nowhere to be found here; it's at most a snapshot, and a snapshot of a scene you'll be grateful to have missed. It's too late for me, but I implore you: save the precious moments of your life you'd otherwise have lost forever by watching this, and spend them on one of the dozens of more worthwhile films out there instead."
5,So hot it'll make you sizzle!!,"R. Daniels has a unique writing style that continues throughout each 6 stories! He captures the fantasies of both women and men in such an erotic and sensual manner. I would suggest this book to both men and women alike... once you read it, you'll understand what I mean when I say, it's so hot it'll make you sizzle!"
4,Well Hell !,"Some sick muthas that never got many hugs from mommy and certainly don't deserve to be hugged now. They needed killing from the day they were born. This may suit your mood exactly. Sorta Aussie does Hollywood, but that aint so easy to do."
2,Gore Doesn't Equal Good,"Sorry but I have to whole heartedly disagree with everyone I didn't find this exciting or really that suspenseful to say the least. They story has been done to death and it's a weak one at that. The photography was great though and the gore was gruesome but that doesn't make this a good horror film. To me it seemed gore for gores sake with no character development or back story. This is the story in a nutshell, couple goes boating, gets stranded and captured by backwoods psychos, husband wimps out, wife goes on violent rampage, they leave. A rental at best. Hoping some of the upcoming films don't disappoint me as much, ie THEM (ILS), Inside, and Frontiere(s)."
2,Good for the last 20 minutes....,"Other than the last 20 minutes of the movie, which was totally gory, fun, and downright wrong, the movie was a bore. The production values were decent which gave way to impressive, and bloody effects. The acting was not half bad and although the plot has been done before many times, it wasnt a complete waste of time. I'd recommend it if you have nothing better to watch."
1,it just doesn't compute!,Who in there right mind would invest money & time into something so painfully worthless! Terrible beyond description.. I'm at a loss..
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"This movie is a strange, sick, twisted, gore fest, that tries to be another Devil's Rejects but sadly misses the mark. It has it's funny moments and the ending was great, but until that point, it just drags on and on. If there's nothing else to watch, go for it otherwise... don't bother."
2,This is all very familiar.,"It seems that today movies are made with the expectation that if you're really, really bold about showing violence; get really disgusting; that you're making art. This is one of those films. Frankly I've seen it all before and done much better. I Spit On Your Grave, for instance.In Storm Warning the victims make stupid decisions, for stupid reasons. Not much seems very original.You can do better by looking for another title."
3,"genuinely scary, great atmosphere..","brief plot: a young couple go on a romantic boating trip. They get lost and land on a shore to seek help to get back home. They stumble across (what they believe to be) an abandoned shack. However, soon after two brothers and their father return home. They are all half-drunk and half-crazy.The two brothers abuse, and assault the couple. They have no motive, other than being sadistic personalities. The couple must find a way to escape their backwoods tormentors. Will they become victims or fight back?* horror fans will appreciate this film..most of the film is shot in the dark in a rain storm, which adds a lot of gloom to the story, giving the right touch of horror atmosphere and suspense."
1,Awful Soft Porn,"This is bad gay soft porn on a low budget. The script is trite and predictable, full of cliche two dimensional characters. The acting is universally awful. There is some attempt to present a positive outlook about gays, except when they are repeatedly portrayed as victims. This is overshadowed by the repeated negative message of dispassionate vacuous revenge. Virtually all straight men in the movie are portrayed as violent homophobic thugs. The actors are okay looking at best. There is plenty of skin, including some frontal nudity, but if that is all you care about, you'd be better off renting real porn. If you want a good gay-themed movie, there are dozens out there that are far better than this. Don't waste your money on this movie, either to buy or rent."
2,revenge in olympia,"disappointing, having gotten other films by this director iwas sorry for him with this one. no *real* nudity at all (there has never reallybeen a story line in any of them anyway so he needs the nudity factorto have people buy his products ). don't know if i will buy any of hiswork again"
2,Definitely Art House,"Before deciding to see this French movie, I read some reviews on the Internet, as well as at Amazon. I then picked up the DVD, adding it to my queue. A couple of days ago, I finally got around to watching the movie.This film is what I would call an Art House Movie, a VERY Art House Movie. It takes place in a French brothel around the turn of the century (circa 1900). The movie's storyline is centered around the daily life of the brothel's women and their customers. Be aware that there's lots of nudity and sexual innuendo.The photography is great, but the actual story is boring, moving at a glaciating pace. There isn't any tension. None. I never felt any empathy for the characters.Now everyone's taste is different, but from my perspective, I didn't care for the movie. It was a chore having to sit through it. Aside from that, however, it was a nice glimpse into brothel life.Plot: A character study of the brothel women and their camaraderie.I give this movie 1.5 stars out of 5."
1,Depressing as Heck,"I usually like off-beat films that explore different kinds and aspects of human relations. Foreign films seem to offer a depth in that realm that American films mostly eschew. This film, however, was just plain depressing. I guess you could watch it if you want to perhaps be more thankful for living in these times. Other than that, I found no redeeming value in the time I spent watching this. It really left me with a 'downer' feeling for quite some time after."
3,Interesting Not Erotic,I have to input 20-words... Interesting Not Erotic. I have to input 20-words... Interesting Not Erotic. I have to input 20-words... Interesting Not Erotic.
1,NOT very sexy,"The movie was slow, with little or no emotions from the females. The so called sex scenes were boring, were not erotic. A total waist of my time. I was expecting erotic scenes to turn me on, got none of that. Acyually does not even deserve a one star."
5,How Can You Go Wrong??,"Ah man, you can't! I remember many things as a child, as well as TV Shows. One of the shows that are closest to memory is Punky Brewster. It's cute, sweet and clean. I wish they would re-air this thing on Nick at Nite (like they're doing with Full House...another favorite of mine) so the next generation of kids can enjoy it as we did! I have two young cousins ages 8 and 12 that discovered the Full House series when it started airing on Nick at Nite.I really hope they consider this. Anyway, this is worth it and it's fun to watch while going down memory lane. I only have the first season and I'm going to buy the second season pretty soon.You can't go wrong!! :)"
5,the next generation of Punky fans,"Its great to have these dvds to share with my girls, age 8 and 2 1/2. They watch Sabrina and got a kick out of watching Punky. My 8 year old loves to watch them because she know Punky was one of my favorite shows, when I was about her age. I'm a young mom, my daughter also has friends with moms my age and they all know Punky. Punky was an important part of our past - who didn't try to walk out ofthe house with two different sneakers on. Sharing my past with my girls is important, we also bought DUKES OF HAZZARD SEASON ONE for my husband to share with the girls. I know one of my moms favorite shows as a kid was I LOVE LUCY. To me that stuff is important, the people we love won't always be here - but a suttle reminder of who the were is always nice."
4,Too cute and colorful to be missed,"I had heard a lot about this show when I was growing up, but never seen it. So when I was ordering some dvds I decided to get this one-boy I am glad I did! THis show is sooo cute, lots of bright colors and it is great for kids with the material in the show being something that parents don't really have to worry about. For adults, it is a great look back at some of the 80s fads,slang and more its also great way to reflect on your own childhood. The dvd is no disappointment from cartoon for the kids and kids at heart, to seeing what cast looks like today-there is certainly something here for the whole family!"
5,Kids of the 80's,"At 32, I am not ashamed to say I still LOVE Punky Brewster, and I am so glad to own a series and share it with my daughters. Who, by the way, at 5 and 2.5, already love it! I find that there are not a lot of innocent kid based shows any more, not like when I was growing up, and Punky Brewster is just that."
5,Another Awesome DVD Release,"I have virtually no complaints about the Punky Brewster DVD. These episodes look great and have the same charm and innocence that they did 20 years ago. If you enjoyed this show as a child you may want to introduce it to your children because something about watching Punky as an adult didn't have the same effect on me. Some of the jokes were kinda corny. What is awesomes is you get 2 hours of the cartoon ""It's Punky Brewster"" the cute cartoon with Glomer the magic creature and Punky's friend. The DVD is packaged, only thing missing is a current interview with Soleil Moon Frye but she was on Sabrina The Teenage Witch for 3 years so it's not like she dropped off the planet. The package is nice and it's also cool they had that one hour special ""Fenster Hall"" which seemed like a spin off but don't know what happened."
4,Woefully incomplete,"How they can call this ""the COMPLETE first season"" is beyond me. It's missing the controversial Episode 24, in which Punky is kidnapped by Manitoban separatists. As we all know, NBC refused to air the episode due to the graphic violence and raw language (also, to avoid offending residents of rural Manitoba like myself). Still, it SHOULD have been included -- for the sake of the historical record, if nothing else.Shame!"
2,Well...,I guess when I was lil' it was great...now that I am older it is a bit blah...but it's a classic.
5,FINALLY!,"I had been waiting for several years to get my hands on Punky Brewster episodes, so I was more than THRILLED to find Season 1 on DVD! I finally got it for Christmas & I've watched so much of it already! The episodes are sweet & simple, without beint too childish for the child-at-heart. My husband even watches it with me! It was a great surprise to see the interviews & ""It's Punky..."" cartoons on each & every disc! I can't WAIT to get Season TWO now!!"
2,Poorly Designed,As noted by others the shred/vacumn portion of this equipment is quite worthless and difficult to use even if working briefly.The collection bag is to be so small as if they were never serious in the first place.It should also be noted that the blower is actually less powerful than the lower cost [non-shredder] hand held blower by ECHO.The blower has a tendency to quickly overheat and then shutdown. When it has cooled it may be restarted and will after 4-5 minutes repeat this cycle.As the machine ages this will worsen.When carrying as a blower the side air intake has a tendency to pull your pants against the screen lowering the air flow.It looks good but doesn't do either job even partially satisfactory.
1,Wast of money,"This product is totally garbage, and a wast of money. It clogs every 2 seconds even with dry leaves. Damp leaves forget it. When it clogs it takes 20 min to un clog it. Save your money and buy a rake, I was so fed up with it I threw it in the dumptster>"
5,Ventshade - EXCELLENT Value,"Iam very pleased with the quality, and ease of installation.I installed these several months ago, and they have been satisfactory.The Ventshades are great for fresh air. Even when it is rainingyour window can be lowered an inch or so. Also, I used to get aglare on sunny days at the top of the drivers window. The tintedplastic alleviates the glare. I do recommend this product. It isa very good value."
3,get it before it's gone,"the arty production catches soundgarden in their pre-""superunknown"" days. In fact, the tape precedes Badmotorfinger. The concert video was difficult to follow , what I liked were the interesting self-produced videos for ""loud love"" and the anthem ""hands all over."" Judging from Chris Cornell's new direction of ""Euphoria Morning,"" Music like this will gone forever once the existing stock is expended."
3,Great speaker - Dull Book,"I saw Tom Morris speak at a conference in Orlando in 2012. I was blown away. Easily one of the best speakers I have ever encountered. But the book... There are some good ideas here. But the writing is, to my mind, thoroughly uninspired. I slogged thru the 1st third of the book before finally giving up. I cannot recommend this book."
5,GET THIS BOOK NOW!!!!!!,"I read a lot of books - 100+ a year, every year since 1989. I have read a ton of philosophy and ""Self-Help"" books -- many are excellent - but this is the best.Tom Morris does a superb job of writing a fun, enjoyable - and life-changing book. His seven C's are absolutely spot-on. I have read this book cover-to-cover five times - and I enjoy it more, and get more from it every time. If you are only going to read one ""how to live your life"" book - this is the ONE. I assure you that this is a truly wonderful and incredibly helpful book."
5,The Art of Achievement,"Great book , very interesting and resourceful.simple to understand and based on practical solutions. I can recommend this book to any one who wants to have a head start in life.You will enjoy every bit of it"
4,"Solid, accurate pattens spanning many eras, great base book.","This book is a great one for learners and pros alike. The patterns span many design eras and it is a good tool for demonstrating to clients and friends what is possible, pattern-wise, for a project."
4,Great book and great ideas,"This book is great for traditional patterns, specially for the ones from Great Bretain. It shows different types of patterns depending on the period of influence, like Edwardian, Art Deco and others. I wished the patterns showed some color!!!!"
3,"Wonderful desings, but...","Wonderful desings; however, all in black and white... I expected more... the next time, please put a note about that."
1,Black and White BOOK,Did any one say it's not in color? and why the cover is colored?Stained Glass Designs should be in color.I am very disappointed.
2,Seriously..,"I was in awe when I got this product in mail. I should have known better that it was literally a kid's toy. The entire thing is no better than an actual toy for kids. However, I find it pretty useful as my doggy's dog bowl."
4,Easy to read and perfect for beginners,"To be fair, I have the first edition of this book, dated 1987, and called ""Turbo C Programming for the IBM"". It has been with me many a year and has always been my favorite C book. It is the easiest of my C books to understand, and can be read like a novel with only occasionally going to the computer to try out their programs for reinforcement of a concept. All their examples are complete programs which are very helpful to me. Drawbacks to this book include: a) their sections on ""Turbo"" C are not applicable anymore, b) there are sections dealing with pc-specific issues that are not useful, and c) the C is not ansi compliant. However, in spite of this, it is still my favorite book because it is easy to understand."
2,Not a very good book,The previous review was for the 1994 edition of the book. I bought the 2002 version of the book. This edition does not have the disk packaged with the book. Instead a broken link to the TELOS web page is given. After much searching on the internet I did find some of the notebooks for the book. But not the notebooks and ASCII text for each chapter. Without the chapter notebooks the 2002 version is just about worthless. It has only been four years since this edition was published and TELOS does not support the book. So I give the book two stars.
3,Ok,"They are a nice quality and served the purpose I was looking for in my Halloween party, just wish they were a bit taller for the price they were at"
3,"Good introduction to ""Figure 8""","I very much enjoyed this newly released single, and due to it have high hopes for the upcoming ""Figure 8."" The production on ""Happiness"" is much like that of ""XO"" which at first disappointed me. However I find this to be a far better production job than that of ""XO"". The ending of the song makes up for everything, where the full band is playing, and as if someone slapped the record to a full stop, all the keyboards, electric guitar, and backing vocals come to a stop, leaving nothing but the bass, light drums, and Elliott Smith singing and strumming. An excellent ending to this song. The second track, ""Son of Sam"" gives hints of Smith's earlier recordings with the two guitars and harmonica. Excellent track, and worth the price on this single, because it will likely be a full band version on ""Figure 8""."
5,Thank you,"They sing so well together, and the songs are so sentimental, it makes me cry when I listen to the cds"
3,Open Ended,The game is Open ended and at times the direction or style of play is a bit like playing a lot of the old school style video games in the RPG style. It is a good game with many endings and a lot of every strange humor is hidden with in this game. But as a whole most players may find that this game lacks a lot of polish but its not a bad game for the price. It looks like it could have been on a handled system or Play Station but it's nothing to take away from the benefits or quality as a whole. Many games by far are worse then this one.
4,Fun if you don't mind getting lost at times,"The game isn't hard to get into but because it's a free-form rpg (as in you really don't have a ending per-se to really strive for, it can get kind of Monotonous at times. Don't get me wrong, it's fun but if your looking for a game were you can go on a linear adventure to save the world and the like, this isn't it."
1,THE MILLENNIUM MAINA,THE BOOK WOULD BE OK IT YOU WERE IN TO ALL THIS MILLENNIUM MAINA STUFF BUT I AM NOT SO I REALLY DID NOT LIKE IT
2,Watch is very large,Watch is a little too big for my wrist. Other than that it is fine. Get it if you have a big wrist.
5,THE VERSITILITY OF AMERICA'S FAVORITE SINGING COWBOY,"GENE AUTRY IN THIS CD, SHOWS JUST HOW VERSITAL AND GREAT AS A SINGER HE WAS. HE COULD TAKE ANY SONG AND MAKE IT SOUND LIKE ONE OF HIS OWN. HE COULD GO FROM WESTERN SWING, TO BLUES, TO EASY LISTENING AND NEVER MISS A BEAT. FOR A GENE AUTRY FAN THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER HEARD. BUT THEN IF GENE AUTRY IS SINGING A SONG, IT HAS GOT TO BE GOOD! HE WAS THE GREATEST!"
3,Sorry butt,"it sounds too much like wall paper Bruce Hornsby . The Last Drag was just that . I gave it a try but it laks soul , tippie and all ..."
5,"Excellent book by a thoughtful, sincere individual","As a home winemaker, I've had the pleasure in the past to make wine from grapes grown by the author. Prior to reading the book, Lars had impressed me as an inquisitive, well-read and knowledgeable individual who cared very much about people and all living things in nature. His open & honest narration was truly a pleasure to read. In some respects, it's almost like a diary."
4,Entertaining,"The Rest of Us isn't really about the 'rest of us', it's mostly about the American Jewish experience through the lives of those Russian immigrants who became famous in America. This emphasis can be forgiven, because the famous are the people that most of us want to read about and identify with. You get a peek at the turn of the century Lower East Side community, and gain an understanding of how very reformed Jewish traditions and entrepreneurial opportunity for Jewish immigrants got a jump start in a free country. I would have liked to have heard the author debunk the myth that all Jewish immigrant families wind up rich in this country, however. Enjoyed the insights regarding the clash bewtween German and Russian Jewish comminities and influences."
1,"Much too slow, too much ""look and feel"" not enough Generator","This book is too all encompasing of the design process for anyone who works in design. It is probably good for techies who have never done graphics before to get a grounding in ""look and feel"", but for me, it was a waste of time. I'm throughly familiar with the design process, I need generator specifics. It is a good book, just not as technical as I needed."
2,First book on Generator but shallow in content,"I was really excited when I received this book. I have been waiting forever for a book on Generator, but this book left me disapointed.There is some good information on Generator but it leaves tons of information out. For example, all of the objects are not covered, its doesn't show how to use Generator with asp (or other languages), and there is nothing about using Generator through the web server. (These are jsut a few examples).The book is useful in showing what to expect when working on a Generator project, but as a book for learning Generator it misses the mark."
5,Great Book,"This book was extremely helpful to me and would be great for anyone in this field. Adeptly written and easy to follow, it really showed that the writers had a fantastic grasp on this technology and could convey that info easily to others."
3,No color in a book on FLASH,"The first thing you notice, as you leaf through this book is that there is NO color. This is very strange since the book is about FLASH. Aren't those the dynamic, eye-catching pages on a web site? So why would a book written about how to use FLASH be in black and white?Generator/Flash is written in a small font making what little code there is very hard to read. The saving grace of this book is that it comes with a CD where you can find exercises. The chapters contain information on building templates and building a database.Generator/Flash is a book that will help those who design for the server-side of web sites."
3,Adp102,"This story book tells you the world of cardcaptors and a puzzle, The contents of the book is I am a regular girl, how I became a cardcaptor, being cardcaptor, the cards, capturing the spirits, meet Kero, meet Li, Li and I working together, welcome to my world, all about me, meet my family, meet Madison, friends and foes, Kero's korner, expect the unexpected!, and bye for now! THis is great book to buy. Their is one thing I did not like about this book. When this book talks about Mr. Terada (Sakura Teacher). There is a picture, but it is not Mr. Terada."
5,"Intelligent, Yet Accessible Antidote to Ignorance","This book is a must-read for anyone interested in Islamic law, women in Islamic law, or Islamic dynamics of authority. Abou El Fadl presents an amazing depth of knowledge; his references will provide helpful further reading to those so inclined. It is refreshing to hear the perspective of someone who has a first-class Western education, as well as a strong traditional education in Islamic law, hadith studies, and other Islamic ""sciences."" His perspective is rare, and highly enlightening. This book really opened my eyes to the complexities of the Islamic tradition, and I welcomed its intellectual rigor after reading so much pseudo-scholarship. In short, this book sheds light on this little-understood, often-vilified, complex tradition. Enlightening!"
1,This is garbage,"Just a warning, this is not sanctioned anywhere by the Chicks, DON""t buy it, it contains ads for stuff within a CD, no songs"
2,Ripped off,"This was a present to my wife. Who was absolutely thrilled. Upon her opening the set, everything was perfect with the exception of water instead of body lotion in the tube saying in fact that it was body lotion. When I checked it further it was all but empty also. I would buy from Amazon again, but not from this seller. They had to know what they were selling."
4,Still growing!,"Arrived in great condition and excellent packaging protection. Has been growing! Grew a lot the first year, showed some buds the second year. No cherries yet but maybe next year!"
2,A visual medium on AUDIO?,"Took a chance and failed. Wonderfully read and produced, this seemed to be a way for the makers of the book to make extra cash fast. Read the books instead."
1,Don't buy it,"1. It's too small for even one person.2. The filter is terrible, I have coffee grounds in my coffee cup everyday I use this.I realized all this is, is just a bottle to mix hot water and coffee together for 3 minutes, then it has it's own ""strainer"" which does nothing.Don't waste your time on these products, all you need to do is mix boiling water and coffee in a bottle for 3 minutes, then use your normal metal strainer in your kitchen to pour it in your cup, it's exactly the same thing!"
2,Not quite what I was expecting,"EBOQ seems like a nostalgic list of quotes from heads of a varying range of business areas. I was hoping for something a little more inspiring and guiding and with a sense of clever humour. Unfortunately, I found several quotes were unspiring, unenlightening and not really humorous. I presume there are and have been executives who say some rather ordinary things. This book might be entertaining for those who know the people quoted but for others of us it has been somewhat disappointing."
1,Lame,"I expected better from Oxford. Full of obscure quotes that mean little to most people, except maybe the authors. Very few profound utterances. Esoteric at best. Save your money. Find quotation websites and/or get the Yale book."
4,Short but Good,"This is a Dragon Magazine short adventure book. I have played Grakhirt's Lair and The Inheritence (two of the adventures in this module). They were pretty good if you did a little fleshing out, however quite short. Levels 1-3. Get it if you need something to do on the fly or if you need an idea for an adventure with a presetup framework."
4,Stunning Sophomore Effort,"Teena really begins to spread her wings with this LP- her second album in her stunning four piece Motown suite. Lady T is much more multi-textured than her debut effort. This album, along with her third album, showcase Teena Marie at her vocal height. The album starts off with the rip roaring funk of ""Behind The Groove"". It follows with the beautiful supple ballad ""Now That I Have You"". The gospel tinged ""Alladin's Lamp"", the power ballad ""Can It Be Love"" and the mid-tempo number ""Why Did I Have To Fall In You"" round out the mid-section of the album. Lady T concludes with I think one of the best vocal's of her career, ""Too Many Colors"". She soulfully massages and caresses the low notes and soars when she reaches her higher notes. Listen to her when she dips down low and sings ""one million different shades""-- gorgeous!"
4,Worth it for the bonus track PILOT TO CO-PILOT!,"LADY T is a stunning, sumptuous soul CD from Teena Marie, produced by RICHARD RUDOLPH, the man behind MINNIE RIPPERTON, but the real gem here is the BONUS non-LP cut PILOT TO CO-PILOT from the vaults - from Teena's searing ""hot damn"" refrain to the tasty 70s guitar riffs, this is one of the best Teena Marie songs few have heard - a genuine sexy soulful sleeper!"
2,Wycliffe Series 1,This series was just ok and I wouldn't go out of my way toorder series 2. There are better ones out there.
3,Needs remastering,"Really quite a well done show, but images dated and not as clear as would expect today. PLEASE remaster this series--it has a lot of potential."
3,"Good, Not Great","As fans of British mysteries we had high hopes for Wycliffe and were somewhat disappointed with this series. They're not really bad just not as good as we had hoped they would be. We'll continue to watch them and see if anything changes but as for right now the jury is out.I've watched this type of series mature over a season or two and hope this one might improve also; I have ""New Tricks"" in mind particularly which improved after the first season in my opinion.You may like it more than I do and it's worth checking out."
2,Keeping an Open Mind,"I'm keeping an open mind and will see more Wycliffes, but the length of the stories (45-50 minutes) is inadequate for the form. There is not enough time and space in which to develop characters, not enough time and space in which to develop subplots and, hence, mysteries and not enough time to linger over the lush Cornwall settings. I'm not arguing that it's all about the time. Frost is wonderful and only a little bit longer; Midsomer Murders are wonderful but sometimes a bit too long, but the time constraints contribute to the problem that the investigative triumvirs in Wycliffe are not particularly interesting people, the stories are not well-developed and the perps fairly obvious. The guest actors, however, are often excellent, so that there is material on which to build. I'm keeping an open mind, but so far I've found the series a bit dull."
2,Lackluster performance by main character throughout series.,"We were very disappointed in the Wycliffe Series One because the main actor who played Wycliffe was too unresponsive to the actions in the story. Compared to other British mystery series, it was dull and not worth the time spent watching it."
5,Excellent!,I'm so sad that Estee Lauder is no longer making this scent. It's been my favorite for years and I don't know if I'll be able to find one that I like as well.
3,Curious Mix,"An interesting choice of films to ship together. Animal House and Fast Times would be considered classics, but then the addition of American Pie? A good movie but it just doesn't suit the rest... Guess I just like my sets to hold a more specific theme than ""it has a school in it doesn't it?""...All up, I'd say I enjoyed all of these movies. Each has it's own appeal, Animal House for the classic dumb frat house road trip style, Fast Times for the fresh dialog - well it was for it's time... And American Pie made for a nice feel-good movie with some good laughs along the way. I expect all three had hidden lessons to be learnt but I sure missed 'em all :)Get it if you like some harmless dumb fun at a low price."
5,boogie woogie,if you like great boogie woogie that keeps your toes and hands rapping and tapping this is a great album to test the waters with the music like this is almost lost but along with a canned heat fried hockey boogie this makes a great album
5,Wow.,"Incredible music. Strong guitars and keyboards, descriptive lyrics, orchestration to deepen the sound, and real honest-to-God harmonizations. Most of the tunes have a ""slay the dragon/kill the evil wizard"" theme but it's just great music. Calling it metal may actually do it an injustice as there is way more here than riffs and drums. Get it."
3,The third chapter that should have never made it,"I'm a huge fan of Hokuto no Ken series since the early 80's and I was very disappointed when I saw this series. Everything seems made to be a mere marketing operation. The 3D scenes don't always match match correctly with 2D, the animation is not so good, the plot is a bit boring and the new voice of Kenshiro is much worse than the original one by Akira Kamiya."
4,Complete Italian: The Basics (CD),This is a great way to learn since I spend a lot of time in the car.
5,Lack of time to take a course in class? Look no further!,"I always wanted to speak another language. Although I am bilingual, fluent to Spanish, Italian was my next goal. Since is similar to Spanish, I wasnt too hard for me to learn. But some words in Italian I had no idea what it meant or how to say it, but with this item it made it much easier to learn and to follow. I will take a class next semester, but if you dont have the time to do so, then I stronly recommend this coursebook/cd...All I need is SOMEONE to practice so I can get more confident. Of all course books outhere that I reviewed and actually opened to read them, this one was the best one for me."
4,"Good book, excellent slower pronunciation","Really good, really need to study the CD and book at the same time. Cannot fully learn just listening to the CD in the car."
5,awesome product,"has handled everything i threw at it.thou i found with apples, i need to filter it so it wont be cloudy, handles everything with ease."
2,Not what I expected.,I am afraid that this product did not work for us. Not only we had clean up the counters full of flying pulp and pulp was full of juice as well.
2,"general overview, but thats it.","I was extremely dissapointed in the book, not so much becasue it was bad, but more because it was not what I expected. I expected a book about starting a money management business, but instead found someone telling me what technical analysis software packages are on the market, and who sells data! While it is broad in its covereage of the process of developing a trading system, I don't think its deep enough to spend the time or the money on."
3,Uneven,"Uneven comedy. Several hilarious scenes, but also long, boring sequences that fails to be funny, especially in the beginning. Inspired by Ed Wood, but not a remake. Ed Wood was a funny drama, this is an occasionally funny comedy. Best scene: Eddie Murhpy being followed by footsteps in a dark parking lot."
1,This movie is Horrible!,"I just got done watching this movie, and had to come on line to tell everyone how bad it is. The only bright spot is Eddie Murphys dual role. This reminds me of another dog Bullworth. If you liked that movie you will like this one. Rent or buy ED WOOD with Johnny Depp and Bill Murray."
2,This must be for the easily humored,"I couldn't find too many things to chuckle about in this one, just like all of the other Steve Martin movies. I thought that at least Eddie Murphy can save this one, but then again, it was written by Steve Martin. Although there was a great plot, the jokes were too bland for my taste. "" Tom Cruise didn't know he was in a vampire flick until two years later.""..that and how Martin's character rounded up his crew for the movie were two of the funniest moments from Bowfinger, but that's it. The rest was comedy that anyone can find from a saturday morning cartoon."
4,Very funny,"My expectations weren't very high when I rented this, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I was laughing throughout the entire movie. A few scenes were annoying though, especially those involving Eddie Murphy's cult. Still, I highly recommend Bowfinger, and it's worth seeing for the last five minutes, which had me in a fit of hysteria."
3,Pleasant but Unsatisfying,"I enjoyed Long's irenic tone - something that is often lacking in the ""worship wars."" Unfortunately, he is intentionally vague throughout the book on what constitutes God-pleasing worship. In an effort not to offend, he leaves the reader with a vague idea that worship should be warm, pleasant, meaningful and reverent but does not go into specifics on how to do this. I enjoyed reading this slim volume and mulling over its anecdotes but it would not be on my short list of books to recommend on worship."
5,Nena!,Nena has to be one of the best singers to come out of Germany! (Isn't she the only one? Hmm...) I love Nena and all of her music! I definetly recommend buying this album in Addition to Fragezeichen! (Don't buy the US release of 99 Luftballons.. no lyrics :-( cheaply made)
3,buyer beware,"like all of the phones now being offered by verizon, this phone had its ability to play mp3s disabled by verizon. like the lg 8700 my kid got and a new 8300 a friend got, verizon changed the software to eliinate your ability to enter the 'secret' menu and enable mp3 playback.the camera takes great pictures. had to add an internal antenna booster to prevent calls from dropping- my old lg phones with the external antenna stub ( 8100, 8300) had much better reception.if you want to playback mp3s, better to go with at&t; samsung synch instead of verizon. wma versions of the music sound like cr*p compared to mp3s. but corporate greed for profits wants to force you to buy songs from them instead of transferring your mp3s to amicro card for playback.btw, unlike lg phones, this model has two secret menus.update: the problem with calls meant they exchanged my 'new' one for a refrub with updated samsung software 'zh07' on it."
1,worthless product,"went through 15 samsung A990 in 4 months. the problems are during phone conversation,it turn off by itself. error leaving and entering service show on the screen constantly,alot of signal faded error. alot of call drop,mp3 player file malfunction. unable to use wireless headset due to softwares .problems have not fixed yet. still waiting for newsoft to solve the problem. hopefully before i retired"
1,THIS PRODUCT IS A ZERO!!!!!!!!,"I would rate this product a ZERO if possible. Please do not believe any of their claims about being better that Botox or Restylane and waste your money! You would be better off to save your money for Restylane as I plan to do for the fine lines which I want to smooth out and soften. Luckily I was only out $28, buying a mini size of this joke of a product on ebay. I wish I had never wasted even that amount! This stuff does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING... you could put the cheapest lotion on and get better results!"
1,Soft Sound,The alarm sound was just too soft. It would not work with someone who was hard of hearing. This product was returned.
1,Ripped off customer,"Company is not reliable. Watch broke two weeks after the one yr warrantee was up. I wrote company to no avail. Save your money, buy an alarm clock!"
1,Can't hear the alarm beep!,I'm a type 1 diabetic and ordered this watch so I'd have several daily alarms reminding me to check my blood sugar and eat. I have pretty good hearing but could not hear the alarm beep. The watch was useless to me so I returned it and ordered another brand that has vibrating alarms - the Vibralite 8.
5,Super Buy,This watch satisfied all of my alarm needs. You can set 12 alarms. It is VERY user-friendly and it is great for elderly people. Very easy to read and the alarms can be set to audible or vibrate. Superb investment !!
1,Looks nice but loses it's comfort fast,"I bought this chair from Office Max because it looked great and seemed to be quite comfortable as I sat on the floor model. Once I got it home, that's when I realized I may have made a mistake. This chair is VERY cheaply made. You must put it together and the pieces barely fit. The quality control of the manufacturing must be done by blind people. After about 3 weeks, the foam cushion in this chair broke down and caused me to have severe back pain.I work from home and sit in a chair for at least 10 hours a day and I was hoping this chair would work out for me. It did not. I'm gonna stop screwing around and just buy an Aeron."
3,Interesting Discussion of Catholic Church Issues,"BREAKING FAITH is an interesting book by an author who generated quite a bit of controversy with his recent book on Pius XII.While many of his positions are not in line with the officials teachings of the church and its authorities, Mr. Cornwell succeeds in outlining key points of controversy among Catholics. While many critics would characterize the author as anti-Catholic, it is difficult to ignore the issues confronting the roman catholic church today. Whether you label yourself as a conservative, a progressive, even a surviving member of liberation theology, the book is valuable in presenting a point of view held not only by Mr. Cornwell, but by many members of the church."
1,Social Worker Catholic,Cornwell is obviously confusing true Catholicism with some form of political socialism. He forgets that the Catholic Church has always been a form of counter-culture. It teaches a form of restraint and discipline as an anwer to the unbridled freedoms found in society which are now more pervasive than ever. He seems to be seeking a way to express himself without any constraints thus his criticism of Church teaching with regard to sex. The existing teaching does not just come from the present Pope but has been handed down from many previous Popes. He might be happier in another denomination that could give free reign to his passions.
5,My Westie Loves this stuff,"This shampoo works great on my Westie, who suffers from a skin sllergy. As soon as he gets a bath using this shampoo, all of his itches seem to go away -- and stay away -- for a good amount of time. So glad I found this product!"
4,Pricy but works,"On the recommendation from our vet, we started using this 2 years ago. Our Griffon has little staph like patches every 6 months or so. After using this shampoo for a couple of weeks, the patches start to disappear. We bathe him often so it is a bit costly, but it's well worth it."
1,BEWARE!!!,My Dog had a very bad reaction to this shampoo. After using it I contacted my veterinarian and was told this is very toxic for the animal.
5,Helps my sick puppy,A vet recommended this shampoo because my old girl had a yeast infection. The shampoo is more expensive through the vet so we got it here. Worked great. I wouldn't use it unless advised by someone with knowledge about your puppy's condition.
1,Not well made,The very first time I used this set wat to cut a stick of Fench bread. I used the large knife and the handle broke. I will be looking to replace it.
1,Don't bother,"They are flimsy. They wobble like trying to cut with a rubber ruler. Also, they tear up cutting boards.Worst knives ever."
1,buyer beware,"I have owned a set of diamond cut cutlery set for over a year and thought it was a decent set until I had to cut through some soft frozen fish. The blade just broke from the plastic handle - it is only attached by one rivet. I was able to pull the blade out of the handle with my hand. Thought it was just that one knife that was faulty, so grabed another knife and it did the same thing. I was determined to finish cutting up the fish, so using their meat cleaver, proceded to cut up the fish and it lasted a little longer than the knives, but it to broke out of the handle. Needless to say I was greatly disappointed and wanted to see about their limited lifetime warranty. Well its limited alright, couldn't even find a location on where to see about a warranty claim, as if I really wanted to keep such a cheap set of knives around anyway. Save your money and buy a nice set of knives, not the ones manufactured by Diamond Cut."
4,nice product,i enjoy this body wash as the scent is minty and makes the whole bathroom smell nice. the only negative comment i have is the secondary scent of the rosemary. it is an odd smell with the peppermint. but all in all i like the body wash. the suds are rich and my skin feels smooth after use. i think ill try another fragrance in the future.
3,Burt's Bees Bodywash,The Milk and Shea Butter Bodywash is OK. I far prefer the Peppermint scented Bodywash from Burt's Bees. The milk and shea wash does not foam up. It also has almost no scent. This product is not the type of soap I need.
5,very pleasant,"i like the minty fresh feeling in the shower. its a mild scent that im glad i cam enjoy for showertime but doesnt linger after i dry off and apply a totally different scented lotion. ya the texture is different than a regular bath wash but it doesnt bother me a bit, afterall i didnt buy this product so it would be exactly the same as some other brand. sometimes i use it on my hair and the first day it is a little stiff but by the evening it feels so soft and looks so shiney. maybe it helps strip away buildup? not sure but i think its great ;)"
5,Citrus and Ginger Root body wash a must!,"I use this and only this to wash up, mostly cause its natural but the smells in the shower are awesome! I love knowing what exactly im putting on my skin and that its natural, and that im doing good for my skin and body. Will def. keep getting this product."
3,Probably a one timer,"Okay, I wanted to love this but will not buy again.+Burt's bee's and natural+Reasonably priced-DOES NOT provide suds while cleaning-Need to use a lot of the product to feel clean-I do not feel cleaner afterwards-The smell is conflicting, smells nice for a second and then smells mediciny.***I think this would be good for people with eczema or really dry skin.I will try another body wash next time, I'm going to finish this bottle though."
5,Far better than other Enviro-friendly bodywashes,"After trying other natural bodywashes with poor results, I had low expectations, as well as concerns for the high price. I was pleasantly surprised by how much lather this stuff produces! The smell is pleasant and earthy, but not overpowering or lingering. I definitely plan on continuing to use this, but I still have a long way to go before I finish my first bottle."
2,Mediocre,"I thought I'd give this a try since Dr. Bronner's isn't on subscribe and save... and I'll be going back to Dr. Bronner's despite that.This stuff has a strange texture. It's hard to describe, but it doesn't lather very well and once it's diluted in some water the lather disappears completely. It does seem to wash my skin fairly well, but it leaves my hair very stiff and gross feeling. This might be better suited to a hand wash.The scent is ok; I am not much of a peppermint person, but it's tolerable. I prefer the scent of rosemary, but I can hardly detect it."
4,Leaves Skin Feeling Clean and Fresh,Overall this is a good product. I am a guy and this cleans my skin perfectly. I got the Milk and Shea Butter fragrance and it smells decent enough. It is a pretty light smell but it stays on your skin for a while but only so much that you have to put your nose right up to your arm etc. which is perfect.Only problem is that you need to use a lot when showering. The bottle only lasts me a month whereas my trusty Lever 2000 bottle lasts 4 months. Kind of a deal-breaker at $8 a bottle = ~$100/year on body wash. But the wash itself does the job. I bought a second bottle but will probably search for a long lasting alternative.
3,divine scent but too irritating for sensitive skin,"This body wash smells heavenly, the peppermint isn't overwhelming but smells fresh and relaxing. I have sensitive skin but have never had a problem with other body washes. This one made my skin dry and itchy, leaving little bumps and giving the appearance of eczema. I repurposed it for a hand wash because it smelled too wonderful to throw away, but unfortunately I wouldn't buy it again; the peppermint oil was just too irritating for my moderately sensitive skin."
3,I like Dr Bronner's version better !,"I was excited to try this since I love the scent of Peppermint bath products.I generally only buy Dr. Bronners Peppermint Castile Soap but I wanted to try Burt's Bees version. Sadly, Its not nearly as Pepperminty as Dr.Bronners and it does not leave you with the same fresh feeling.I also missed the tingly sensation that Dr.Bronners delivers. Also,I could not detect the scent of Rosemary in this version.It does smell mildly of Peppermint though.In fairness even if I was not comparing it to Dr. Bronnners I still would not have been impressed with it.The Peppermint scent was too faint and left no detectable Peppermint scent on my body after my shower."
3,Great Body Wash.... but.....,"This is a great body wash, but I was a bit dissapointed because it does not make much lather/suds, so I find myself using lots of it! Great scent though!"
3,Average Body Wash!,"This is the first time i gave Burt's Bees 3 stars...Heres why:I like the scent, but it doesn't last long.It leaves my skin irritated when i apply it with a pouf."
5,This product is a MUST HAVE -- the BEST body wash ever,"I've rated other body washes, and this one is second to none! It is perfect. It's got a soft peppermint smell, it lathers nicely, and it's made from mostly natural ingredients (90-something percent...I cannot recall the exact number). This body wash makes you feel clean without feeling slimy or squeeky clean. Just CLEAN. It has a fresh SOFT scent, and it's suitable for men or women...or kids as well. I am allergic to many perfumes, but this lightly scented wash does not bother me at all.I recommend this product wholeheartedly. I'd give it six stars if I could."
1,Strong overwhelming peppermint,Do not like this product. Bathing with it in the morning makes me smell like I rubbed ben-gay all over my body. Plus Chlorox bought out Burt's Bees. I don't support this.
3,Rewarding for some...,"This book is by no means ineffective , but it seems to me that Culleton attempts to evoke emotion in the reader as a literary device, rather than as a logical cathartic response to the novel's events. While April and Cheryl are engaging characters, others seem displaced and unbelievable. The rape scene is disturbingly effective, however, along with a fitting (albeit conventional) ending. This book will probably be appreciated by a teenaged audience, but is certainly not very rewarding for the adult reader (I'm reading it in college)"
5,Funny Costume,"Item as described, perfect fit for my 3 month old. very comfortable fit for him and my son don't seem to be bothered by the costume."
4,A Story That Hits Home,"Overall, the best part of Craft's novel is its ability to make the reader think about his past. All too often Mark Manning's experiences made me re-live episodes from mine (sometimes with laughter and sometimes with tears). Craft has made Mark Manning believable because he is so like the rest of us. Struggling with the same feelings and sometimes fears. Few books today are successful in doing this. Craft draws the reader into the minds of his characters so well, the reader doesn't know it until the last page is read, and then of course it's too late. You just have to find out what happens next to Mr. Manning and his new found love Neil.But perhaps, best of all, when I finished the book I felt satisfied. Again, another rarity in today's mass produced fiction.Great job Craft!"
4,Mark Manning: PART ONE,"Like other Craft fans, I discovered ""Flight Dreams"" after reading the second in the Mark Manning series ""Eye Contact"". For that reason, I can be more objective, I think.Every writer is constantly developing, changing, experimenting, and growing in his/her chosen profession. Craft's first mystery is a prime example of an author ""testing the waters"". While the killer's identity was somewhat easy to determine, the author populates the book with some fascinating, if slightly improbable, characters. Craft's attention to character is also evident with the personal life of protagonist Manning.And the vivid descriptions of the locales and the adornments show a man that appreciates the aesthetic.""Flight Dreams"" doesn't quite ascend into the far reaches of space, but it does get airborne.And what better way to spend leisure time than by being curled up with an entertaining and carefree escape from the daily grind?"
4,Re Flight Dreams,"As a lapsed Catholic, a runner, an owner of and admirer of Abysinnian cats, and a ""late bloomer"" who had my first same-sex relationship in my early thirties, how could I NOT like this book? The plot was good, the characters well-written and likeable. I think Craft writes as good gay mysteries as Zubro, which to me is high praise. I have ordered the nexy two in the series and am looking forward to them. A GOOD READ!!!"
1,Unfortunately thin and amateurish,"...The book is honestly not very good. The plot is thin, with ridiculous characters that don't amount to much more than throwaway caricatures. Even the main characters of Mark and Neil are bland and unmemorable, without any defining character traits. The mystery is not much of a mystery, and instead of building to a revelation, just meanders to a finish. Finally, there seems to be an attempt to make a statement about organized religion and homosexuality, but it comes across as ham-handed and mean-spirited. A cartoonish televangelist hates gays? Well, that's not very original, and it's certainly not fun.I want to encourage young writers, and especially ones who introduce previously unheard voices into the mainstream, but I unfortunately cannot recommend this book."
2,Passable plot hinges on strained contrivances,"Merciful mother of Maupin, are gay readers so starved for quality material that they must overpraise this mediocre novel? There are flaming contradictions and red herrings at every turn and the dialog wins no prizes either, nor do the often cartoonish characters. Sadly, I have read ***far*** worse novels in the gay mystery genre and the author at least kept me turning pages, even when I didn't believe a word of it. Go for Aldyne, Stevenson or Zubro to see how it's done with subtlety and style."
5,No stigma on being single-enjoy,"I read this book in the mid-80's. Bought it for $1.00 at a sidewalk sale. Read it; thoroughly enjoyed it; practiced what it preached and mistakenly lent it to some co-workers to read. Never got it back. I want to buy another copy, now. It has made my life as a single much more enjoyable and without excuses or apologies. It's my life and I live it to the full. Ms. Harayda hits the nail on the head every time. Great read even now in the 2000's."
3,Sound is decent. Convenient controls. Wastes power when off.,"These speakers work and they have a convenient Power, Volume and Bass controller with an additional headphone jack and input on a cord so that it can sit on your desk within reach.The Bass is overly boomy as is common for cheap speakers, you'll want to leave it turned down pretty low.Power Consumption: Even when turned -off- these speakers draw 7 Watts of power according to my Kill-A-Watt meter and the large stand alone transformer stays warm. What a waste. Roughly 5 KwH/month for no reason."
2,leaves falling,"Im reserving my final decision... the leaves are all falling off. I expected some leaves falling but they are all shriveling and falling.No it doesn't need water, and no it is not over watered."
4,An excellent version of the most popular Polish opera,"As an opera fan, I had never heard of Halka until I visited Warsaw's Wielki Teatr last year. There I had the privilege of taking part of a loving tribute of the Polish opera fans to Barbara Zagorzanka. She deserves it, and her interpretation on this CD is a proof of her fine qualities. Ochman is also outstanding, as well as the orchestra and the choir. The rest of the cast is good. The sound is very good, in spite of the fact of being a live recording. We are fortunate to have the possibility to get an exquisite piece of music in such an excellet version. It is not easy to get this opera on CD in Poland, and practically impossible everywhere else."
3,not the best available!,"every true hip hop fan should already have every eric b and rakim album or cd,but for those who don't,this is not the best compilation of their work.three classic songs are missing from this ""best of"" collection, ""move the crowd"", ""as the rhyme goes on"" and most noticeably,""my melody"",but any eric b and rakim is better than no eric b and rakim, so for the casual hip hop fan this will suffice. if you want a much more complete complilation, go with eric b and rakim ""GOLD"", a double cd that contains all the great hits and some not so well known songs as well!"
5,QUANTUM HOT SAUCE Grease- The Best!,I use both the Quantum Hot Sauce oil and grease on my fresh and saltweater reels and you can't go wrong. It is the best product out there!
3,Definately not what I expected,"I'm not really past the first chapter of the game, and I've restarted everytime I've figured out something dramatically wrong with how I was doing it.The story line behind the game isn't bad. The game itself, once you begin to understand how to do this or that, progresses decently. Game play, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. It's like handing someone a book in another language, and an abridged translation dictionary -the further in to it that you go, the more that you understand-As I've seen it so far, it's a good story line, the question is, do you have the patience to fight through understanding the mechanics of the game to get to where you're paying more attention to the story than you are to figuring out how to play the game to begin with."
1,"Extremely complicated, no tutorial.","The other reviewer pretty much summed everything wrong with this game up, I just feel the need to add that there is also nothing even remotely resembling a tutorial, so the only instruction you do get is in the woefully inadequate guide. The screenshots and description on the back of the package got me very excited, so it was a pretty big let down when I actually started to play it. Do not buy this game."
2,You're better off buying something a little more expensive...,"The adaptability to virtually any type of ipod is nice. I like that it has a CD player as well, as I haven't had time to rip all of my CD's onto my computer yet. The preset EQ's don't quite give me the control I want, and nothing sounds as crisp as I would like, but I knew that would probably be the case when I bought it. The CD player is really sensitive, and skips a lot, which makes me less likely to listen to CD's on it, which is a bummer. I'm generally happy with this thing, but given all the other options out there, and having purchased this online rather than in a brick and morter store where I could have tested it out ahead of time, I think in the end, I would have made a different purchase."
3,iPod Stereo,"This iLive Stereo is a convenient to play your iPod's music directly without headphones and simultaneously charges it. While it does this well, there are numerous flaws associated with the stereo. Its Memory doesn't work well, it constantly shuts off, and after the first 8 months you may end up with a few problems. However, these do not take away from the main purpose of the Stereo, so I encourage others to buy it. 3/5"
2,Buy Something Else,"This has a lot of great features that I wanted, but (i) it doesn't put out much volume, (ii) the remote control is hard to work (press hard on the buttons, but not too hard; don't be too far from the unit; the Menu button doesn't work at all), and (iii) the first time I used it for a prolonged period, my iPod froze up bad (wouldn't play at all). The last one could just be a coincidence, but I'm taking it back before more problems erupt."
2,not working,I just recived the item today. Took it out of the box and it did not power on. I asked for refund and order a diff item from sony...
3,iLive portable boombox.,"great idea with radio, cd & Ipod features. works really well, if a bit heavy. Sound is average but not too bad. not many other choices for the features. Happy with it."
3,iLive Portable Boombox,I have been very disappointed with the iLive Portable Boombox...the sound is very distorted and doesn't have a true stereo sound. A regular boombox from Wal-Mart has a better sound than this.
4,Basics,I'm still working through the book but it has given me a new way of looking at how to draw things. I seems to be able to follow along pretty well. I have enjoyed it.
5,One of our favorites,My daughter has several of these and we love each one. The mess is less than you think and they come with a play mat that's not shown to catch any sand. We began giving this as a gift and so far it been well liked by everyone.
3,a much weaker sneaker pimps,"Overall this album is enjoyable.What's wrong with it:-Too much monosynth. Every song is composed almost entirely of very similar sounding beeps and boops. One thing that makes Sneaker Pimps albums great is all the rich samples and sound effects. The sounds on this album get boring pretty quickly.-Overwrought vocals. Too much falsetto and vibrato, etc. Chris sounds a bit like that guy from Muse occasionally."
3,A Vocal Legend,"Though Chris Corner may indeed be just that, a legend in trip hop and electronica alike, ask yourself this friends, was this album worth leaving the Sneaker Pimps. It has not shed much light at all on him that was not already there, and I'd imagine only a few people outside the sneaker pimps circle have purchased this CD. Shall we so soon forget the magic of Chris Corner and Liam Howe (the two founding memebers of the sneaker pimps) as displayed in Splinter? Dont get me wrong, I more than expected this break-away, he is an adventourous artist if nothing else. But if Corner wants any recognition he needs a CD composed of songs matching the splendor of ""Your Joy is my Low"", ""Sick"" (bloodsport),and of course ""Half Life"" (splinter). Sorry Chris, I love ya but this wasnt worth breaking up the band. Which I hear will attempt to go on without him."
5,An Electronica Masterpeice...,"This cd is amazing. Chris Corner has really created a dark, sensual album with Kiss And Swallow. The songs are all very similiar to the last two Sneaker Pimps cds...in Fact, this cd kind of feels like it is picking up where BLOODSPORT ended. I love this cd. Chris has such hauntingly unique vocals and the beats are all stunning. The cd has such a broad range of moods and characteristics that they are really hard to explain. Buy this cd if you are a fan of the last Sneaker Pimps albums or any form of Electronica with vocals."
4,Cool,"Well, forget everything you heard about Corner simply wanting to be like Radiohead. This album pretty much takes the early industrial (I'm not talking about NIN), lite trip hop, and 80's flavorings that cropped up in Bloodsport and takes it to the extreme. His voice might seem a little much after a while, but I made it through the first 1 1/2 listens before it got a bit annoying in a single sitting. At least he knows how to use his voice qualities and limitations properly, unlike a lot of people who don't capitalize on their strengths and stay away from their weaknesses as they should. It might seem like gimmickry, but that's kind of the whole point of using your voice as a hook. The weird gay heroine addict theme of the photography might throw some people off, but the guy's just skinny, likes funky fo-hawks (read that: really big bed hair), and the color pink. Can't blame a guy for that."
1,Alma Mahler without Passion,"It is marvelous that someone has performed songs by Alma Mahler, whose passionate songs reveal complex harmony in which her husband probably had some influence. Unfortunately, Ms Lippitz gave a cool, academic and rather lifeless performance of these songs. The tempi plodded along, making the songs seem endless which could have been helped if the accompanist has pushed the singer along. Her light soprano sounds student-like in these songs meant to be sung by a more dramatic voice: high mezzo-soprano or dramatic soprano and her pitch wasn't exactly inaccurate but without color so there was a flatness pervading the songs. This CD is for ""the archives"" only, good that the songs performed but a boring performance (My husband, a Met Opera Conductor & I performed these songs in NYC from manuscript-facsimiles some years ago and we recently listened to a tape from that concert - far better)."
3,Better than its reputation,"I agree with the other reviewer that this book desperately needed a proof reader. It's one of the most error-filled books I've ever read. That complaint aside, I'm glad Pure Imagination reprinted this volume and sorry to see it has gone OP again and climbed in price. I too knew it only as a source book for comic collectors. The more lurid 1950s comics spotlighted in its pages have ironically become more valuable for the notice Wagner paid them. The chapter on comics is not typical of the rest of the book though. While Mr. Wagner clearly didn't ""get"" or like comics, his observations on film, pinup mags, TV, and other mass culture are pretty entertaining. Relentlessly intellectual, he found much to dislike in mid-50s America, but he approached most of it with wit and a distinctive, wry sense of humor. The comic chapter is a hatchet-job, perhaps worse than Wertham's, but the rest of the book is pretty good!"
5,Fight Club Robe,"My Texas Aggie is going to love this robe come Christmas morning...he is a big fan of the movie Fight Club and he is going to be super ""stoked"" w/ this robe!"
4,Solid evidence,"A good historical and documentary approach to this part of Latin America's History. The book focuses very well in the main dictatorships that were involved in this dark operation, but at the same time it doesn't dig deep enough in Bolivian's dictorships participation. It shows a little bit of Banzer's regime and I think it should have included more of it and Luis Garcia Meza's as well. But I think this would provide enough material to write a new book.I enjoyed the book and found it very interesting. I strongly recomend it"
2,Better quality version available elsewhere,"After reading all of the negative reviews of this disc, I should make you aware that the ""Hilton Special"" Australian concert performance is available elsewhere, and with pristine video quality(from the original video masters) on a new DVD ""Herman's Hermits-Listen People"", a disc created with the cooperation of the group's four surviving members."
3,Fun,"This tape is a lot of fun, but is really for beginners. If you are a complete beginner, you will learn a lot and should be ready for a trip to Italy once you complete the course. If you've already studied some Italian, don't expect any grammar or verb conjugations. This is very, very basic."
3,A tear when I Bought It,I really enjoy this product and I wear it all the time but when I bought it it arrived with a tear in the side about an inch long. I still enjoy it but am dissappointed.
1,What relief?,"I'm 37 weeks pregnant and today my doctor diagnosed me with an yeast infection (my first ever). It's now 1am and I've been pacing around the house unable to sleep with all the burning and stinging I've been feeling since I inserted the ovule! I know the instructions say that while using the product we may expererience ""mild"" increase in the burning and itching, but this is just ridiculous! The cream has done NOTHING to help sooth the symptoms, and I don't know if the ovule is actually working or just making it worse! I don't recommend this to anyone and will probably try a pill or something different if I ever get another yeast infection."
3,"Factual, but unlively...","Karlsen does a good job of gathering information on these women's backgrounds and finding important correlations in them, but her narrative remains dull, even for non-fiction standards. While some of the detailed biographies given were essential to back her theses, she seems to throw some in just to fill space (i.e. pulling a ""Dickens""). Her theory on the psychological motivation for girls who claimed to be possessed was grasping, though many of her other points were strong. She is not without prejudices of her own; however, and is often guilty of stereotyping herself. Calling something that millions still ascribe to as truth (the fall of man in the garden of Eden) as a ""myth"" is particularly insensitive. Still, it gives a comprehensive look at the specifics of colonial life during times of great tension."
5,brilliant,"Karlson is a brilliant author who writes this book, explaining a feminist point of view to the witchcraft trials in Salem and 17th century America."
4,great resource and overview,"I have used this book in research for my thesis on women classical composers. This resource was valuable as a starting point and addresses the ideas of what it is like to be a woman in the music business and includes references to classical composers, conductors, performers, etc."
2,ack! i should have read the description carefully!,"this is a blank book. when i took it out of the packaging i was so delighted because this book is so CUTE. i thought, ""how portable, sturdy and handy! it will fit in my current project bag!"" then i flipped through it and discovered that is blank. it is pretty much useless. there isn't enough room for much handwritten info unless you have tiny handwriting - i'm so disappointed since the format would have made a PERFECT portable volume, yet is useless as a ""journal""."
1,Poor Quality,"The tube is very cheaply made of light weight plastic. The lid is screw on and will simply pop off if the tube flexes at all. The bottom holder for the strap broke within the first day. If your trying to keep something safe, try again!"
2,Not a great product.,"I bought this because I needed poster tube that would accommodate a 42-inch poster. This was pretty much the only one that wasn't super expensive. Yes, it accommodated the 42-inch poster, and yes it protected the poster from getting smooshed on the plane. So it did it's job. But I wouldn't buy it again. It was very flimsy. Also, the locking mechanism for the expanded lengths didn't work very well. It kept coming unlocked and collapsing on itself. And the screw cap on the end just kept popping off. Honestly, if I had known how crappy this would turn out to be, I would have just used a regular cardboard mailing tube."
3,Not what I was expecting,"The original ad said these tubes telescoped to 48"". They don't. They adjust to only 43"" which is not long enough for my purposes. But, we found a use for them anyway. I am still looking for something to hold 4'x4' posters."
1,Terrible quality,I would not recommend this product - terrible quality. The locking mechanism does not work and the screw-on lid mechanism does not work either. As a result the poster tube constantly collapses and the lid pops off every 10 seconds.
3,"fast delivery, quality just so so","pros: delivery fast, cheapcons: the tube is kind of soft, connection between the extended parts is not stable, easy to drop"
1,Agreed; the description is wrong,I agree; the description is incorrect. I called to return this item about 10 times and MyClassroomSupplies never answered the phone.
3,Of interest to fans of Robert E Lee,from the prospective that it does include personal letters from Lee. The recounting of the campaigns is prefunctory though Fitzhugh does come down heavily on Longstreet and eagerly takes up the cudgel for the Gettysburg-wasn't-Lee's-fault crowd.
3,Interesting life history,"I liked the book because it gave an insight into what a good man Robert E. Lees was, but I got a little lost in the details of civil war battles and soldiers' names."
2,"Very dry, only bragging rights to Robert E. Lee's descendants","My high hopes were dashed. It was ""soandso begot soandso who was wonderful,"" I kept reading hoping to learn more about General Robert E. Lee, but I found it to be a vanity piece for Fitzhugh Lee instead of ""A Biography of Robert E. Lee""...."
3,misrepresented,"Thought the book would be hardcover rather than a paperback. Large (sandwich?) stain on cover so definitely misrepresented as ""like new"" condition."
3,I've Been Waiting For This Moment For 9 Years (3.5 Stars),"Yeah, it's been that long since The Score dropped. Anyway, ""Take It Easy"" is a good song. The production on this track is good, but Pras soils it with some weak lyrics. I never thought he was all that tight, so I wasn't expecting much, but it's like he's getting worse or something. Wyclef's verse is just okay. He drops a decent lyric here or there, but nothing to write home about. Basically, what makes the song worth checking out for me was to find out whether or not L-Boogie could still spit flames. If you haven't heard this song and you're curious, the answer is definitely yes. She rips it. No question. I'd reccomend checking this out. It's not their best stuff, but it's refreshing to hear these guys together again."
2,just ok,"considering all the Hype with this reunion this song is just ok.Lauyrn Hill is back,but not back to her Peak time of say a decade ago.Wyclef is just going through the motions.Pras is just there. not a Comeback track for all this time."
3,Still looking for perfect bike saddle,"While this is a very well made bike saddle, it was not very comfortable for me as i am on the thinner side of average. Unfortunately, I had to return it and the return was handled w/o problems."
3,Not my favorite.,I was disappointed. The CD doesn't have the type of Salsa music that would make me want to dance. Bummed.
5,Oy Ve Como Se Va and so forth,"What a way to enter the New Year! I caught the video of this performance just after midnight on January 1, 2003, and I could not, absolutely could not do a thing until it was over. Except breathe. What an extraordinary dynamic bundle of rampant, ecstatic, WONDERFUL energy Celia Cruz is, a paradigm of joy ... OK, I've gone over the top with bad writing but though it's sixteen days later, I'm STILL enamorata of salsa, and Ms. Cruz and Company. The music is fabulous!"
3,"esta bueno, pero.... hay un error!","tenia que comprar algo de Celia, y esto me parecio lo mejor. Porque, tenia todo en vivo y mas. Cuando lo puse en mi computadora, me gusto muchisimo, el unico problema es que entre cada cancion, pues al final de cada cancion de repente en medio de la musica la cancion para, y cambia a la otra cancion. No es buena cualidad. No es su culpa. Creo que los que lo hicieron no prestaron mucha atencion, y querian hacer algo rapidito para el dinero...........no se........."
2,strap and housing don't last long,"We've had this watch for little over a year. The elastic strap started to fray and come apart a few weeks ago. Then the rubber housing that holds the watch to the strap broke. So now we have a good working watch with no way to hold it on the wrist. Not the kind of wristband you'd find a the local drugstore. And anyway no way to attach it to the watch anymore.The elastic band difficult to adjust to the right size. Also, though the watch itself is waterproof, the elastic band takes a long time to dry so not very comfortable to wear after a swim."
4,I'm happy with my purchase.,"My husband and I participate in serveral off-road atv rides during the summer. I was looking for a watch that could get wet and muddy. I wanted something that didn't have a rubber wristband, because that makes my wrist sweat, and I was looking for a watch with a lap timer that didn't have too many other features making it difficult to use. This watch fits the bill. I've been very pleased! The only drawback, and I didn't realize this when I ordered, is the watch has a stretchy, fabric, adjustable band but there's no buckle or velcro. You have to pull the watch on and off over your hand. If you have a small wrist like I do and you have to shorten the band quite a bit it makes a double layer and it becomes a little bulky. It didn't bother me enought to send it back, but I'll try to find something with a different band next time."
1,Not the old Ironman I used to have!,"I got this watch just a couple of months ago. This is my third Ironman. My first one which I loved, was stolen. My second one was also fantastic and I retired it only because after many years the band cracked apart and was not replaceable. This new one, I thought the cloth band would be better- but it does pop open a lot. Ok I can live with that, but, the watch has been malfunctioning and going blank on the face. It goes in and out and sometimes has to be reset. Right now it seems to be waterlogged which is odd because I shower but don't even swim with it. For a brand new sports watch that's hardly acceptable.I never had that issue with my other ones. I now have to try to return it for warranty repair. Not even sure how to do that."
4,Chemistry and Life,I'm very pleased with my purchase. I needed the book for school and I received it within a week.
2,Needs better diagrams and illustrations,"The illustration on electron energy levels needs to be more clear. There needs to be improvement on how the periodic table's properties are explained. The text needs better, simpler and more clear graphs and illustrations. There are much better Chemistry texts out there than this one."
5,Great book,"Great book, takes you from 0 and teaches in a nice and easy to understand way fundamentals of chemistry up to organic"
3,not the greatest material,"Ok, so I got this for my husbands work bench in the garage. Did not expect the cushion to be covered in hard plastic. This actually had a tear in the material but my husband decided to keep it and tape it up. We were having a lot of returns at the time and he did not want to bother. So price is good, quality is so-so."
1,Dead Fryer,"Bought this fryer June '09. Used maybe a dozen times and loved it, but... It died yesterday after I tried to change the oil. Did not change it after inspecting and finding it wasn't necessary. After putting it back together nothing worked. I am so mad and now find others have had this problem. I would be interested to know how many of these happy folk have changed the oil yet and their story. I am mad."
2,"Fine while it worked, but one day it MELTED!","Bought this fryer about 4 years ago. Despite some difficulties with the basket being a bit small, the large oil capacity with a solid heating element made for some nice, very crispy fried food. That is, until just recently, when without warning my son saw the unit smoking after being turned on. It wasn't the oil that was smoking, it was the unit itself. The upper portion of the element near the lid (covered with plastic) had begun to melt. I don't know the reason for this, but obviously it's not safe to use. Now I hesitate to order another Waring product. It's not like we were using it too much one day, I mean we had just turned the thing on and this happened within minutes. If we hadn't noticed right away, perhaps in another minute it might have caught fire? I don't know, but this sure seems like a serious design flaw."
2,Power Attachment and Main ON & OFF Switch Problems,"I have had this Deep Fryer for about a year and the other day the main on and off switch simply fell apart in my hand when turning it on. The spring flew across the room and that was it for my deep fryer! In the trash it went.About four months ago I had trouble with the quick breakaway, it wouldn't hold a connection. I tore it apart and reworked the plug. Very poor connection. With the Company name of Waring - They can do better, Make a better product and I would gladly pay more for it."
4,Excellent fryer,"This fryer is easy to use and clean, heats up quickly, and drains food very efficiently."
1,Basket and top get stuck creating a very dangerous situation.,"I had to return this fryer because the fryer basket hit the back of the fryer and would sometimes not drop when the handle is lowered. The fryer had to be bumped to get it to lower.If that's not bad enough, the top also would not open when the button is pushed. The fryer had to be smacked pretty hard once or twice to get it to open, which is dangerous since it means the hot oil is going to splash around.When the open button was pushed, one side would not retract completely, which is why it would get stuck closed. I think the whole fryer was crooked."
2,I bought not 1 but 2 of these,"I bought my first fryer and it was fantastic.. Easy to use, nice to look at gets nice and hot... But after the second time I changed the oil and cleaned the machine the heating element would not heat. So I thought, OK maybe I did something that broke it during cleaning, forked over the 100.00 for another one... But this time, I was extremely careful to avoid cleaning around the heating element and wires, yet after doing an oil change and cleaning the stainless bowl the same exact thing happened.If you never needed to change the oil, this fryer is great... but beware the heating element is very delicate."
5,"Good design, easy to use, works well","Easy to use, easy to disassemble, easy to clean, delicious food - - what's not to like?The design is very nice. It really is a ""Cool touch"". Mechanisms for opening and closing the lid, lifting and lowering the basket are very smooth.The only reason I'd buy a more expensive model would be to get a larger capacity, but that would entail more counter space, more cost for oil -- not worth it for home use."
4,The facts speak for themselmselves,"This book had a nice flow, I finished it in about two days. Very interesting, but a little too explicit for innocent teenagers.Its a sad story, the way this young girl is unwanted by any female in her family.She is a pretty tough chic though, always finding a way to survive."
2,A shallowly done book,"The title of this book is truly indicative of its content- the facts, and nothing more. Although it could delve into multiple levels of human feeling and emotion, it does not; it presents an unfrilled, straight-up account of Linda's remarkable childhood without any decorations. The book seems to spin over the big things, not giving any signs of emotional depth in some of the events. Linda's emotions, which would have made this a truly fascinating book, are presented poorly if at all. Although her character is supposed to have low-to-average intelligence, this is pushing it. When the book ends, the reader feels as if they have inexplicably missed something, when it is certain they did not. All in all, I do not recommend this book."
5,"Subversively Direct, Gutsy","Cole's book is very gutsy in today's Pedophile Witch Hunt. I'm glad that someone is willing to stand up against the madness that rips our society apart in hatred by illustrating how a sexual relationship involving someone under the age of 18 is not automatically sexual abuse or rape. It is unfortunate that it is natural that not all readers will understand this book, as it directly subverts contemporary opinion on this subject. Linda withstands the brainwashing the social worker attempts with strength and displays maturity rarely seen in most adults. _The Facts Speak for Themselves_ provides a human, lifelike interpretation of the effects of the gothic story discussed in James Kincaid's book, _Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting_ (ISBN: 0-8223-2177-7). I highly recommend this book, but only to those who are willing to question the tired formula of (someone under 18) + (sexual activity) = rape."
3,Great sprinker nozzle.,"I replaced all of mine due to its adjustable feature 0-360 degrees. Good quality too.Great to now only need to keep one item in stock as spares in my garage.Was somewhat disappointed that shipping & handling did get applied to each double-pack unit.Was that really necessay ? C'mon!Well, at least saved a trip to the hardware store."
4,Fingerstyle Master Pat Donohue At His (almost) Best!,"If you enjoy fingerstyle guitar, you'll like Pat Donohue. Chet Atkins called him one of the best guitar pickers in the business, and he would know. Donohue is a featured regular on Garrison Keillor's 'A Prairie Home Companion' performing popular classic blues songs as well as his own clever originals. As a guitar player myself, Pat Donohue is the guy i wish I could play like. This album is very good, although it doesn't have quite the range of some of his other work. But I'd recommend 'American Guitar' (and any of the rest of Donohue's work) to anyone who likes to listen to good, clean, clever fingerstyle guitar -- perfect gift for anyone who likes Chet Atkins, Doc Watson, Chris Smither ... even Keb' Mo'."
4,book review,This is a wonderful mystery. It is also funny. I recommend it to mystery and/or commedy lovers. It has many good lines that will keep you laughing for hours. When I read I couldn't put it down. The suspence is a killer. I think the author did a great job writing this book. I really think people should read it. It is excellent!
3,Wrong book pictured,"The book is a good reference for any collector. However, the book pictured online is the Second Edition, which we thought we were receiving. We received the first edition, not the second updated version as was pictured online."
5,"Another Mozart, or Saint Saens, or...","This is a magnificient work, comperable to the great masters of music. To understand that a twelve year old could construct a symphony of this magnitude is beyond imagination. Although the string pieces that follow this great work do not match the splendor of the 5th, they are in a class of their own."
2,Amazing for a kid---but have to rate as adult,"I think Jay's fame is not doing himself a service. He needs to mature outside of the spotlight. I think it hurts him that so much attention has been lavished on these youthful exercises. If he sticks with the study of music, eventually he's going to get interested in things like making a large-scale form work, handling transitions, editing material, etc... and he may wish these works were never published. I know that some find this music inspiring, especially considering it comes from a kid. Personally, I have to rate it by comparison with any other new classical music."
5,Best Boning Knife,This is the best boning knife we have ever bought. Great product great value. Here are your extra six words.
2,Be careful,I bought this for an elderly aunt. The material split at the seems. Bought a thinner cushion and so far it works much better- no splitting.
5,An excellent and interesting TREASURE for your very own!,"You really must buy this book. And you must really buy it WITH ""Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea"". At first I resented that ""Ship of GOld"" had no pictures in it; it was all text. And I still feel that way. But now I realize that the pictures of the disaster, and the history, and how the ship was found and the gold recovered, really DID deserve its own book. This book, along with its companion, ""Ship of Gold"", is my choice for BOOK of the YEAR!"
4,"Great little unit, but can be a little noisy","This unit has performed perfectly so far, I have owned it for about two years. The fan is a little bit noisy, but it it keeps the unit cool, and who cares about a little extra noise while you are driving?"
2,May Not Fit Xbox,"i havent been able to fit the cable in my xbox....so bewarethough im not saying it isnt good, just be aware of your type of xbox"
5,Simply amazing!,"When I received this product it was way more heavy duty than what I was led to believe in the picture...at least the ones I purchased from classic game source. These babies came with digital audio and wasn't even expecting it! They make my display look crystal clear and the colors just pop. I haven't been so happy with a purchase in a long time. Definitely exceeded my expectations! A bargain and a quality made product. If you have any reservations about picking these cables up, chuck them aside and click buy. One of the better purchases I've made!"
2,"Cheap, just like in the photo","somebody said they got a great cable through this item listing. The one I got is cheap, just like in the photo. It's ok but don't expect anything better."
1,Doesn't work at all for me!,"I bought this cable hoping that I could get a better picture on my HDTV. Much to my dismay, it doesn't help AT ALL! I get the exact same picture that I do with the composite cable. Not sure why this is the case. Perhaps this cable only works with certain TVs. I have a 47"" 1080p Insignia HDTV. Very disappointed."
4,Xbox Component cable,"Component cables for the orig Xbox system. Its not much u can say in a review about this. It helps connect the older system to newer TV's and receivers. If u got a TV that can do different picture n sound configurations for the different connections, this will be fine."
2,cables,they are cables. they work. thats it. they function well and did not set my house on fire. they also did not require a password or a laser.
1,"Generic, not digital","Beware, using this cable will not allow you to have digital sound from your Xbox at all, which most people care about if they care enough to buy an HD cable...I went from having no HD and digital sound, to HD but terrible sound."
4,"Good, but not great","So, the Xbox advanced AV cable has s-video and optical audio outputs, and this cable has component video and composite audio out. It would be nice to have digital optical audio out and component video on the same cable. I had very little noise either on the audio or the video of this cable, and recommend you save yourself the money and not buy the Monster cable."
2,UGH!!!!!!,It started working at first but then it just stopped workin after two or three hours!! I don't suggest this product because i just ended up having to buy one that WAS made by microsoft
1,does not fit into generation one xbox,"I have a first generation xbox. It is a moded xbox. It has worked fine with for me for about 7 years now. I used a xbox audio video connector at home, but I moved to college and bought a new that had a component input. People have been saying that they have to ""shove it in"" in order to see video. I tried doing this very carefully and was unsuccessful in making the connection work. I tried the new component connection on my room mates tv and still no luck. I might have broken the female connection in the xbox! it would be nice if someone came out with a first generation component cable.or does anyone know of a first gen component cable??"
1,Didn't work for me,Had no video after intially plugging in this cable. Eventually got it work by accidentally unplugging the controller. Picture was garbled and would cut in and out. Plugged the controller back in and got nothing. Dunno if it's crappy shielding on the cable or what. Regular composite cable worked fine. Bummer.
3,"After some work, it does the job","There are small metal flaps in the cable head that must hug the connector inside the xbox. They were bent or mishapened and had to be straightened out with a multitool before the connection would fit correctly. This cable is NOT for switching back and forth so do NOT order it as a spare for a 2nd tv, as that flap will surely be mangled from any removal/replacement. Because I was hoping to switch my XBMC between an HD and an SD TV, I wish I had paid less for the cable than 10 bucks with shipping. Once plugged in, the cable does do an adequate job and I can't knock it for that"
2,x-box connectors,they should say that these are x-box 360 cables not x-box i got some thinking that they were for x-box when i got them they were for the 360 witch i didnt need guess i should have looked at the picture better not what they said it was.
3,not sure,Not sure if i received the correct item. It works like it should though (has the component outputs for HD).
1,It's Not A Game...,"These are HD cables for the original Xbox. There are some lines that come across the screen from time to time and the image gets blurry. It may be an oddity and a broken set of cables, so I do not hold it against the seller. Because I paid so little for this, I am not raising a big stink, but I am looking for another set of these from another seller currently."
1,Poor Quality Component Cables,The purpose of this cable is to provide a clearer pic than what you would normally find over composite. These cables are cheap knockoffs that display considerable ghosting that is not seen on the official microsoft component cables.
1,Do no waste you're money,"The cable does not work right, constantly blacking out the screen causing the Xbox to be unplayable. I had to use my old cable instead of this one. I suppose this cable could be useful to jump rope with or to practice throwing away."
2,Would be great if it was shielded,"It's a not-particularly-long component cable for an Xbox. It's pretty unremarkable and generally does all the cable-ish things you would expect it to do. The picture's sharp and the colors are nice and so forth, but it seems to be almost if not totally unshielded. The vast majority of the time I would have the Xbox on and plugged in through this cable I would get obvious interference that looks similar to the 'snow' you get with bad over-the-air TV reception. It wasn't constant for me, but very close, so I gave it two stars instead of one based on the possibility of it working for someone with less electronic junk near their TV than I have. Would not recommend but if you absolutely positively need a cheap xbox cable maybe you'll get lucky."
1,Careful who you buy from.,"When reading the other reviews I find a large discrepancy in what cables people are getting. I chose one of the merchants other than Amazon as I figured a cable's a cable. The one I got, though purchased ""new"" came in a thin plastic unsealed baggy, with the words ""made in china"" written on it. That's it. No packaging whatsoever, it's like they grabbed one out of the bin and threw it in a baggy. Suffice it to say the cable at first had signal noise, and after making sure all of the connections were solid, it was missing one of the signals to a component feed. Basically the picture was green.Terrible cable, whatever I got. The connectors are cheap on the component end. I'm glad it was good for some people, but I don't even know how to return to this company. I'm just gonna fork out the money for a quality product from a trusted source next time."
4,Decent Quality Cables,"These cables do provide a high-definition connection if your TV will allow it. The only downfall is that the sound is still stereo. Many of the xbox games that came out have had Dolby Digital or at least Dolby Surround. The [[ASIN:B00005R6Z0 Microsoft Xbox AV Pack Advanced - Game console link cable - S-Video / composite video / audio - 4 pin mini-DIN, RCA, TOSLINK (F) - Xbox AV connector (M) - black] is a much better choice than the high-definition cables on this page."
3,Satisfying,"Let's face it-this system ain't exactly HD. I'm beginning to think my Narnia game was mislabeled. But it is good. The colors are definitely improved over composite, and widescreen is always nice to have.My only nitpick, apart from resolution, is the design. The cable itself is pretty plain-looking and not as attractive as most component video cables manufactured these days.All in all, I recommend."
2,Cheap cords...grainy picture,"Although it is a cheap cord if you need a replacement, i did not notice an improvement in resolution, even after updating my settings to allow HD output. The product quality seems to be poor overall."
1,Arrived DOA. Very shoddy construction,"Extremely thin, very flimsy cable that was DOA upon arrival. I don't know how you can screw up a simple cable connector, but it was done. Avoid if possible."
5,Excellent transfer of an older ANALOG recording!,"This is a tranfer to SACD of an older recording. Yes, it is only 2 channels- stereo. However, on any decent system it has a very natural sound with the ambient information conveyed as only SACD is able! Yes, there is some hiss- an artifact of the analog master. It is not a problem for me. The recording and the performance are great!Something to note: I have the LP, CD, and SACD of this recording. The LP always had a more natural tonality. The CD was always cleaner (being a digital copy), had a harsher top end, and a limited soundstage. Instruments lost their ""roundness"" and harmonic flavor on the CD version. The SACD is the ultimate: it has the ""roundness"", smooth treble, spacial detail, of the LP, and the clean pop-free sound of the cd. Simply amazing!"
3,"love the actors, the story not so much","the actors in the movie are what prompted me to see this film. unfortunately, it just didn't gel well and my attention wandered. i think i ended up responding to emails while watching this film. not bad but not great."
3,So-so Remake,"""The Debt"" is a descent film, not by any means, a great one. It is a remake of an Israeli film of the same title. The original (currently being shown on the Sundance Channel's On Demand Service) is far, far better. The understated acting in the original film (by Israel's great actress Gila Almagor, in particular) is brilliant. Not to take anything away from Helen Mirren, but this remake is just a very ordinary film."
4,A good movie ! ! !,"Have not yet seen it, expect I will soon, this was a gift to a friend. So far as they have said, they loved the movie ! ! !"
1,What a waste of some great performances.,"If you are an aspiring actor or actress, then watch this, there are some very emotionally charged scenes in it, and the acting was fantastic. No surprise from Helen Mirren, even the younger ones were excellent. But if you are like me, only wanted to enjoy a good movie, skip it. It is not what you think it is. There is no story, just the same old moral lessons that Hollywood want us to listen to over and over again. The preaching is insufferable."
2,Kept waiting for the point....NEVER came!,"The story line was good, the acting was superb by all, but for someone who also wants a decent ending to book end the interest I had in the beginning...I was so disappointed. When it ended I said out loud, ""Are you kidding me? What a stupid ending!"" The movie started out as a 10 then slid all the way to zero."
1,I Want My 2 Hours Back!!!!!!,"What a stunning waste of time. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but John Madden is a respectable director, and the trifecta of Helen Mirren/Tom Wilkinson/Ciaran Hinds promised, at least, some fine acting. But the movie is a long, pointless,totally non-thrilling ""thriller"". The wntire story could have been told in about 30 minutes, but was drawn out to nearly 2 deadly dull hours. And, as it turns out, the aforementioned actors are barely IN the film. Most of the story concerns thesecharacters 30 yrs ago, so they are all played by younger actors (naturally), all of whom were either completely uninteresting and/or shrilly overacting (sorry, Ms Chastain).AVOID THIS!!!!!!"
2,"A great cast, but sappy, crazy story development","A great cast, but the story seems one-sided. Paints a picture of Jews who were victims of the holocaust as weak, helpless, going freely into capture. Doing nothing to fight for freedom.The portrayal of the Nazi war criminal was chilling, well-done, showing a cold, heartless, unapologetic human undermining his captors by honing in on their weaknesses.Much of the story was sappy, over dramatic. The ending was also painfully sappy, over dramatic.Maybe the point of view was what was intended."
2,What a cast!!!!!!! too bad terrible script,"If you like the cast, thats all you get. The script is just so poor. I imagine these actors just said what the hell they are paying us, but this movie is not the quality you expect from these artist. Rent it cheap if you still want to see it any other option will leave you feeling cheated"
4,Remade,"Remakes are most often disappointing. This remake of an Israeli movie is not outright bad. It has a good basic plot: three Mossad agents are sent into East Berlin in 1965 with the mission to kidnap a Nazi criminal who has been discovered hiding as a medical practitioner. The job doesnt go as planned, which adds to the substantial suspense, as does the tension between the 3 members of the team. The girl wants one of the men, but she gets the other. I shouldnt disclose the twist of the plot here, only so much: the continuation of the story 30 years later with Helen Mirren playing Jessica Chastain's later edition doesn't quite convince, which is due to no fault of Mirren's. None of the 3 actors playing the older version of the young trio is a convincing impersonation of his/her younger self. While that should not rationally be a problem, it does disturb and requires too much credulity."
1,Horrible,"I really was looking forward to seeing this. I wanted to like it, but just couldn't. This movie has a story that should take about 30 min to tell. This movie is beyond uneventful, its like watching paint dry. Boring and painful to watch & thats why I fell asleep - twice. Unfortunately, I woke up to see the end (would have been nice to have slept through the remainder of the film) and I didnt need to be caught as the movie hadn't progressed. Easily one of the worst I've ever seen. Very sorry I saw any of this. Acting was amazingly good, story was beyond boring."
1,"Yes, No, Maybe","Plot is very slow developing, so slow and uninteresting, did not even finish watching. Perhaps for some, ok but not watch I expected, which was a smart, clever, spy movie. Perhaps take a chance but be warned."
2,The Price is Too High,"The debt must be paid, but the price for watching it was just a little bit too high? This is a story that needed to be told, to someone who can't live past the holocaust. Just be glad that Nazi Germany is gone, and that you don't have to relive it by watching this movie."
1,Anti-Semitic trash!,"Can't I give this monstrosity 0 stars? Where to begin: Slow, ponderous, boring and VERY anti-Semitic. Want a movie that glorifies the Nazis as ""just plain folks""? This is your ticket! PC has never been as shallow, as offensive as The Debt. Helen Mirren has a bit role, just above a cameo. This isn't like Red at all!I was bored until I really began to hate this film. The young woman, seen doing great Krav Maga moves, is suddenly overwhelmed by an old, German doctor. Please! This was unreal.Skip this trash and watch Red a second time."
1,Great movie. Worst blu ray ever.,What is wrong with the blu ray manufacturers? Is there a plot to make these things as unfriendly to watch as possible? After the downloading of trailers and all the irrelevant nonsense you are so tired you don't want to watch anything. Bring back VHS!!!
1,Stinker,"Well done and well acted, but a terrible disappointment. It is completely unbelievable that two secret agents are so guilt ridden over one lie! These people are trained to keep secrets, that's why they are called secret agents. Not even close to a believable premise. Two hours wasted."
3,The Debt,"The foreign film was actually better and I saw it for free on Amazon prime, try some of the foreign films they are quite good."
4,The Debt was a worthwhile purchase from Amazon,"This was a very good and engaging movie, with the usual strong performance by Helen Mirren and a very good performance by Jessica Chastain, who I have now seen in 2 very different roles (The Help; The Debt). She is certainly a versatile performer. The movie as a whole was well worth the cost of the DVD."
3,Great Thriller,I downloaded the The Debt I got because I had some promotional credit to use and needed something to watch for a flight. Movie was very good and very suspenseful. I was glued to my Kindle screen while watching this and loved how it went back and forth between present and past to tell the story well done.
1,THE DEBT,I am german so I understand the german that was spoken in this movie.The movie was boring and very hard to understand.I would not recommend it to any body
2,A Clunker for Sure!,"I found this movie emminently unwatchable. I'm surprised that none of the reviewers mentioned the exteneded scenes of the nazi war criminal, as a gynocologist in E. Berlin, making polite conversation with the heroine as he gives her a pelvic exam. Not only do they repeat this scene at least 3 times (what was her purported problem anyway?), but the scenes are spoken in German so you don't know what the hell they're talking about! Then there is the scene where the heroine, woozy from just being knocked out by the the escaping nazi, shoots said nazi in the back using a pistol from about a block away, perched on a fire escape no less. A shot like that is simply not realistic. The interpersonal dynamic between the characters is wooden and uninteresting. This movie is badly directed, badly written, and a waste of acting talent."
1,The Debt,I expected this movie to be good. I was very disappointed in the movie. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it.
3,So much promise...,"I expected this movie to be good because the cast was excellent. There was one casting flub and that was to cast Tom Wilkinson as Steven instead of David. Jessica Chastain gave a compelling performance and Sam Worthington was more interesting to watch than he was in Avatar. The movie made the viewer acutely aware of the dangers of the character's surroundings from the beginning. Because the director established the severity of the situation so well I expected the plot to be worthy of the suspense they tried to drum up. Instead, the movie's one or two plot twists were unoriginal and lacked the excitement needed to get through the remaining half hour."
3,It Should Have Stayed In 1965,This worked as a straightforward spy thriller. The aftermath did not work for me. Be careful not to read any spoilers or plot summary about this one. Trying to imagine how you would react in the same situation is the whole fun of the experience. It needed much more on the 2 older men and less on the older woman.
3,Just O.K.,"This movie was o.k., just not near as good as I expected. I love the subject matter, it just fell a bit short given the excellent cast etc."
2,Fairly boring,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie - but I have to say I was disappointed.I was expecting much more excitement, but there was very little of that. Helen Mirren's character is fairly dull and reserved and even boring. I'm not sure if it's the story or the acting/directing that fell thru the cracks here, but the movie overall just didn't cut it. I would not recommend this.[I even watched it a 2nd time to see if perhaps I didn't like it the first because I had too high of expectations for it...but it was still borderline boring with a few tense scenes - just not worth it]"
3,okay,"Interesting and educational, shows the great diversity of shark species. But slow paced. If you are looking for fast-paced shots of sharks eating things, you'll find little of it in this. Intellectual, but not super entertaining."
5,Brilliant guide to organising short breaks,"This book is highly informative and accurate. It is well written and descriptive. We have yet to be disappointed.However, it may need to be updated since now over five years old."
5,history that helps the pieces fit,"This book looks at the Reformation from the viewpoint of Spain, as opposed to the usual England. It is a very interesting historical fiction and helps piece together what was happening in the rest of Europe during the Reformation."
5,Enough with the platitudes!,"Anyone with any skill as a teacher quickly becomes accustomed to the platitudes thankful students and parents use. This gift book gets pass all of that.Here is a bouquet of thoughtfully written stories about the important work teachers do challenging, inspiring and guiding their charges. It is about teaching that goes beyond the routine of instruction to affect lives.A teacher somewhere in your life deserves this book. Make a gift of it to him or her."
5,Tributes to our forgotten heroes,This gem of an anthology should make all of us feel gratitude to the author for making us remember our mentors and teachers. It would be a perfect teacher gift.
5,The Book of Why Is It(s)?,I really enjoyed this book because it made me both laugh and think about how I look at my own life. My friends and family read it and they enjoyed it as well. I highly recommend it!!
4,not bad,this is a pretty good freestyle cd. elissa has an awesome singing voice. i havent heard anything from her since this album? is she still around?
4,My dog loves it!,"With my previous dogs, I've had pet harnesses. They are confining and the dogs always managed to get twisted up in them. The Pet Tube is absolutely wonderful--my current dog, Poe, loves it. He goes in willingly; I keep a blanket on the bottom of it. He curls up on the blanket and goes to sleep. Sometimes when we get to our destination he is so comfy he doesn't want to get out. I would give this product 5 stars except for the fact that I find that it's very difficult to collapse the thing and zip it up for storing. I don't have any kids at home anymore, so I usually just leave the tube in the back seat.Poe is a medium sized dog (Australian Shepherd) and he and my friend's Jack Russell fit in there perfectly together."
2,Zipper broke first time used-waiting for manufacturer response,"I bought this tube late March 2012 and set it up in my house with both ends open so my 3 small dogs could get used to it and be ready for our road trip.They loved it!I used it in my car for the first time this weekend and the first pee stop we made the zipper came of its tracks. I had to stop at Petco and but 3 new expensive pet carriers that I really didn't need, in order to keep my dogs and myself safe.Very frustrating!The tube itself is a great idea but it could use some improvement other a than better stronger zipper. Petgo needs to take it on a road trip with 3 excited little dogs to see what these improvements would be.I just emailed Petego hoping they will fix or repair. Waiting for response and will update my review.If you buy one be sure to check the zipper before you use it in your car and avoid disappointment and potential disaster."
3,Traveling pet tube,"This was a great idea. However, the tube did not have any mesh area and that made it too dark inside. My dogs did not like it. There is also no way to anchor it so that it could be used outside of the car. It rolls around as the pet moves around in it. Good idea but needs some adjustment."
3,Needs a better zipper and additional access window,"I am buying a second pet tube since the previous one has a failed zipper. The idea of this product is great, but as other reviewers have noted, it is difficult to see out of because of the dark colored mesh, there is no access to the pet for a quick petting, and the zippers are not very durable. I use a quilt inside the pet tube instead of the pillows. They both reduce the head height for my Aussie, and are not quite a good fit in my car. It would be nice to see some improvements, particularly with the zipper."
1,Avoid like the plague,I have to say I was looking forward to this game for months. I became totally addicted to the pool game in the Wii games pack.This is a poor quality Gamecube style game.How can a company make a game for the Wii that uses NONE of the wii's human interface advantages?Dont buy this game and expect to be able to stroke the cue with a realistic action. This game makes you choose your power level first and then trigger the shot... in other words this is nothing like playing pool. You could do the same with a conventional controller.The wii game pack version might not have fancy graphics or any options but the cue action is superb.Dont waste your money on this.
4,Fun Game!,"There have been some negative reviews about this game but I have to say that I enjoy it. I am an okay pool player and I think that this game will actually help me improve. I find the reaction to the game to be very realistic and it has helped me learn about angles. It only took me a short while of fooling around with it to learn the controls and get the hang of it. The previous reviewer mentioned the character picture being located in the bottom left hand corner of the screen, which it is, but on my T.V. the image goes transparent when making a shot. Either way the image being there has not bothered me at all. I really don't even notice it. Overall I think this is a fun game and a good value."
1,I made a mistake,"Because we just got Wii, I thought I would get some games that interested all of our family members. I should have read the reviews for this game first. I learned my lesson. this game is so boring & tedious. I definitely do not recommend it for anyone. I'll be more careful next time."
2,Wii player,"Not like regular pool, different from what I expected. We don't ever play this - waste of money."
1,Please don't waste your money.,"The controls for the game are horrendous. It's as if someone just threw this game together. But the worst part is, the controller accessory that was designed for it must never have been tested before selling it; the manufacturer would have noticed the IR transmitter gets blocked by pieces inside the pool cue stick. Nintendo is allowing too many mistakes by third party companies and needs to tighten down these problems."
2,"If you're a StS purist, don't buy this!","Not only are there mistranslations galore, but the DiC Ent. names & terms remain! (ie-Saint=Knight, Saori=Sienna, Shaina=Shina (?), Jabu=Jab, Mitsumasa=Nobu, Cosmo=mini-universe (??), Galaxian Wars=Galactic Tournament (??))Mind you, I don't blame Viz for these errors. Although unstated within the volume, it is quite apparent that DiC Ent. (the same people who are mutilating the tv series) has a large measure of editorial control. I would like to see what Viz could do without DiCs interferance.My advise: Find the fan translations."
3,Mangled version of a classic,"The manga starts slow, but then gets great along the way. But this version has a seriously bad translation, and altered names and terms for unknown reasons. Versions from other countries have a far better translation, so I'd recommend searching for those rather than this one."
3,Killing a Classic,Saint Seiya is a great Anime and Manga but there killing it when they brought it to the US why is it so poorly translated? they need to get some new people working for them. I wonder if Massami Kurumada knows how bad there tranlations are. Mexico did a better job of translation i'm glad i know spanish so i won't have to suffer the poor voice overs and translations.
1,Not made well,"We got this for Christmas and it is already broken! It constantly jammed and you could not get the gumballs to come out. I picked it up to see what was causing it to keep jamming and I guess the the weight of the gumballs tipping to the side, broke the glass globe. The glass is paper thin! The last gumball machine we had (not made by this company) lasted many, many yrs. and never broke! This is not worth wasting your money on unless you plan on rarely using it and having it mostly for display purposes."
5,1 star Evaluation not true,"The gumball machine I listed has been slow to sell. I advertised A Carousel Machine which it is, the 1 star evaluation that said it is not a Carousel machine is wrong. I said Carousel and it is Carousel period.. So don't discourage buyers without knowing what you are talking about.."
2,"""FREE"" Shipping","Product features clearly states ""FREE SHIPPING""...in caps and all, but scroll down to product details and you'll see ""Does not come with free shipping."" -Rather deceiving, don'tcha think?"
2,Not a Real Carousel gumball machine,"Just to let you know, I was ordering a Junior Carousel machine but this is not from the original company Carousel that made the first gumball machines. This is a copy and not made as well as the original. First and foremost, it is very, very difficult to get the money out of it. The original has a simple open/close slot on the bottom, but this gumball machine has to be completely taken apart. It's also not as well made. It just was a disappointment."
2,not worth watching twice,"Being a big fan, I didn't really learn anything new from this DVD that I haven't already read about. The people interviewed were all producers, writers, coaches, and other industry people, but no one I had ever heard of. I wanted to see more footage of Aaliyah and learn more about different aspects of her life. The narrator was hugely annoying - she talked really slowly with a heavy accent. I couldn't sit still and watch because I was getting bored. It felt like this was just a big promotional video for the people interviewed and I did not feel at all satisfied after watching it!"
4,"It sounds pretty good. In fact, that's just the right spirit.","Robert & Richard Sherman first came to the attention of Disney when someone at Disneyland Records heard their demo of ""Tall Paul"" and thought it would be a good song for Annette Funicello. Annette recorded the song and released it as a single, and it became her biggest hit. After that, the Sherman Brothers wrote many other songs for Annette. Eventually, the brothers were allowed to write songs for Disney movies, with their biggest success in this area being Mary Poppins. This CD contains songs from the Sherman Brothers long association with Disney, including songs from films and songs from theme park attractions. It's a fine tribute to a ""supercalifragilistic"" songwriting team."
4,Great song writing team,"A great recording of some of my favorite Disney songs. I bought this cd mostly because it had the best mix of songs I wanted and saved me from having to download individual songs or buy all the soundtracks. Still I will probably have to buy a soundtrack or two to get more songs I can't get out of my head. ""But I've been, done, seen about everything When I see a elephant fly. What'd you say boy? I said when I see a elephant fly."""
4,I NEED TO SHOWER AFTER READING THIS!!!,"Why, you ask? Maybe it is because I felt dirty after reading it. Perdue does a fantastic job of digging up the lowest scum of mankind and then making that scum turn into characters on paper. After reading the book I feel like ranting on and on about politics, terrorism, and the deep seeded corruption that lies within the very men and women that we look upon to save us. But I will not to that. I will tell you to read this book and to open your eyes to the possibility that this could be our future. (The author's note at the end is a powerful statement by Lewis Perdue, make sure you read it.)"
1,"Would Have To Improve To Be Called ""Bad""","I am a huge fan of political and end-of-the-world thrillers so I was looking forward to this book. However, shallow uninteresting cartoonish characters caught in ridiculously inplausible situations made this book agony to read, I couldn't even finish it. It only gets one star because the bad guys [Kurata and Rycroft] were so wonderfully evil. As for Shirley, the well-stacked [albeit ""surgically augmented""] chain-smoking assassin, well our hero is lucky that burning building just happened to collapse on her just in the nick of time. Whew! I was worried there for a nanosecond."
3,Almost OK,"I chose the book because it's about gene-tampering to produce a plague (just my cuppa!) but it was disappointing in terms of story and not well written. Although I did learn quite a lot about WWII atrocities committed by the Japanese Imperial Army. This happens to be one of Perdue's buttons but he does make a good case that whilst we Westerners are fairly well informed about the Holocaust, we are much less aware of 6 million killed by the Imperial Army in China, Korea, the Philipines and other Asian locales."
2,"It helps a little, but Nikon 4300 lcdi s still hard to see","in bright sunlight. It attaches easily and for that, I give it two stars. Otherwise, the lcd improvement is marginal at best. I think that the Nikon 4300 lcd is just not bright enough. Save your money and get used to the underframing of the optical viewfinder."
1,Rip-off,"I'm the author of this document. It's a simple xerox copy that we made c 1983. I'd be happy to run off copies for anyone for the price of a xerox and postage - $5 tops. It can also be gotten from the Alaska Historical Library in Juneau for the same ""discount""!"
3,Rundgren remixes old favorites,"Todd Rundgren has always shown himself to be an innovator. Some of his releases have left fans scratching their heads, but Todd continues to move on, reinventing the envelope. On the Brilliant Records 2003 RE-MIXES, the liner notes are sparse, but it appears that Todd himself has remixed the original tracks to excellent effect, most with a featured guest artist creating a new part. The new mixes differ from the originals enough to be interesting listening on their own, often utilizing a new tempo.Unfortunately, the packaging is lacking, particularly in that seven of the eighteen tracks (17 are listed) are low-fi duplicates of earlier tracks on the same disc! There are eleven actual different tracks for a total length of about 45 minutes (not the 67 mins. listed.) However, if you liked these songs as previously released, you ought to enjoy these extreme make-overs."
1,same budget rip off-version 8,"again-this is not todd, its a bunch of 80s metal heads adding gtr to his tracks.not good at all"
2,For total beginners,"The book contains few projects suitable for use in model aircraft and in models of other types. Most of the devices described in the book is cheaper to buy then to build on your own. Some common devices such as model finder with buzzer, battery charger with peak detect, V-tail mixer and varyous charging and communication cables are not described. When published the book was allready out of date."
5,wow,"i have always used the regular round cheapy bungee cords, not anymore, these are my new go to bungee cords, work awesome.i have no idea how they will hold up over time, but my initial impression is that these will be here for a while. i will purchase more"
4,Pending installation,"like bundle offer and price, still have not use to make a rating about expectation of product but will use shortly"
4,Will probably buy again if they can handle the extreme cold and heat of the seasons,Well made. Time will tell how they hold up to the elements. They certainly are better than the rubber band-made bungies costing less but lasting only a year.
5,Very nice,I ordered it to relive my childhood love of the megaman x series. It has met the standards I expected. Thank you.
4,mega man x collection,"This game is great, the whole collection in one well priced game. Just wish you did not need to unlock the last one to play it."
4,I like all of Reger,"I had never heard Reger's quartets. I listened to some samples, and it just confirms my appreciation of Reger: he is wonderful, never boring, always surprising, a master of his craft. I have yet to be disappointed with anything he wrote. Why he remains a hidden gem, I can't fathom. Can't compare with other performers, but what we have here sounds very professional, intimate when needed, boisterous when required. This is a real find for me, especially because of the collection of all the quartets: a mother lode!"
2,Dissapointing,While the mountain is a nice centerpiece to a train layout. It is a little impractical since it is hard to layout track going through the middle level that doesnt interfere with track going in the bottom level. Also the middle level uses these little plastic tabs to support the track which have very quickly gotten bent/stretched so that the middle level supports dont work well anymore. This makes track connected to the middle level a little too low and results in trains getting stuck while going through the lower level. I am dissapointed in the quality of this item from learning curve. It needed to be a little taller so that trains could get through the bottom level without getting stuck and they should have had better support tabs for the middle level and you should be able to connect the two large sides together without the middle section. I would recommend looking around for the hill and mountain expansion set instead of this if you want mountains in your layout.
3,Really fun but hard to use in layouts,"The mountain tunnel is a very fun piece - it has three levels (which I don't think any other thomas piece does). It is definitely a layout ""centerpiece"" in that it is the biggest, most central part of the set-up.The problem I have is that it's a little TOO hard to use in layouts. Of course, there are some pre-fabricated ones that look lovely and are loads of fun for the kids, but trying to use the mountain and incorporate other destinations one has is a bit difficult - especially if you are trying to get the layout to fit on a table.Another reason I took some stars off was because if you take out the center middle piece, you can't connect the two mountain sides. That would have made this piece a bit more usable because you wouldn't have had to cover six entrances and exits!I bought this for my two year old for his birthday, and although it makes ocassional apperances on the table, he usually just ends up playing with it by itself on the floor."
3,"Solid product, but watch out if you have a DSL connection","I bought this product (along with the ethernet adapter) in order to more easily network my G3 Macintosh and my iMac. While the installation and ease-of-use seemed to live up to typical Farallon standards, there was a big catch that I wasn't aware of until I got on the line with tech support. If you have the type of DSL connection that I do (BellSouth, via my existing single phone line), you can't really use Homeline and the DSL service simultaneously (they both utilize the same portion of your phone line's bandwidth). I still plan to use Homeline (by unplugging my DSL modem before I want to transfer files), but it won't be as simple as I'd hoped."
3,"Great performance, mediocre sound","This SACD is a wonderful compilation of Bernstein's works conducted by himself. The drawback of this album is the sound quality. As it is a compilation taken from various recording sessions, the sound is varied due to different microphone placement and the approach of each session's concept. Keep in mind Columbia recordings are not always up to the audiophile standard like ones from RCA or Mercury Records in the same period. Nevertheless, the DSD transfer of this SACD is superb and it allows you to hear clearly the difference of the tonal character from different recording sessions. Buy it if you're Bernstein's fan but if it's for sonic alone, you won't be satisfied with this album."
5,Bernstein Blazes,"Bernstein leads these performances with snap, drama and excitement. The SACD remastering improves the original sound considerably.There may be others, but no one does it like Lenny."
1,A complete waste of money,"Well, I tried this on my fireplace insert window, and found it almost completely ineffective. Save your money, use plain soap and water instead."
3,NOT a watch with a compass,"I bought this watch for my husband, who is absolutely thrilled with it, but I had purchased this thinking that it had a functional compass on it. Turns out it doesn't only the compass rose letters that you can turn on a dial if you happen to know in which direction you are coming from it is great, but not if you are lost..... Shipping was fast, very much so, and again, my husband loves it, it is a great product, but don't buy it thinking it has a functional compass"
4,Brutal . . . Fast . . . Blasphemous \m/,"I've read many reviews on this CD and all were negative. But, I'll be the oddball...I like it. It's outright eerie and nerve racking. I guess only those who are really pissed off will enjoy this cd.I was at a gas station and another vehicle had blocked me in and I couldn't get out. So I put this cd on and played Holocaust Summoning and CRANKED IT!!! That got everyone's attention and the vehicle that had blocked me in....MOVED!!! LOLOLOLOL"
4,One of the best products I've used,"Fleas have been very bad this year, and it appears that some may be developing an immunity to the topical products on the market. I use Capstar prior to using the topical products on my dogs and cat, and have had great success."
5,AMAZING,"I have used Revolution for years (without a problem) and just switched to Frontline (at the Vet's request) - which was the first of my problems with regards to fleas. For some reason, the Frontline failed miserably and even thought I began applying it every 2 weeks (versus 1x a month) both of my dogs ended up with fleas.The vet gave me the Capstar tablet Over 25 lb for my 50 lb mix and 70 lb Doberman. Within an hour I saw fleas slowing down and within hours found the fleas dead on the tile floor wherever my dogs were laying. Definitely gross and definitely thrilling as it kills immediately. As many of the reviewers have stated - you need to do a 3 prong approach to attack those darn fleas. Have a monthly maintenance for your dog with Revolution, Frontline (or whatever works best for your dog), have these tablets on hand to do an immediate kill if ever needed, be sure your home & yard have been exterminated."
3,Don't be fooled,This product is only for adult fleas and must be given every day to control fleas. I needed a once a month flea killer. The stuff works but be sure it's what you are looking for.
1,Not even 24 hours,"Worked for 2 doses and all 4 dogs must have built up some immunity (along with the fleas). Doesn't work anymore, dogs full of live fleas 6 hours after dose, checked them after 20 hours and still have live fleas.Doesn't work for 24 hours, in fact it stopped working after 2 doses.Another product just like frontline, advantage, etc that only works in the beginning and stops working."
2,?,My dog still got fleas after 2 months of these tablets. I was expecting more from the product. A disappointment
2,ITs not worth the $$$$$,I spent to much money on this product. Yes she dose teach you a choreography but thats it. It said Something like a bonus but it was her dancing the Choreography. Go and buy Julina stuff its a lot better. ans to think she is one of my favorite dancers.
1,Avoid GPX!!!,The sound is tinny;their products aren't worth the materials they're made of; and they do not stand behind their warranty.
4,"Good performance, good recording","Trying to make a decent ""surround"" DVD-A from older live recordings must be difficult but this one isn't bad at all and you low-end freaks will be pleased to know that this is definitely not hurting in the low frequency range. The only real gripe I have is that Steve Morse's guitar gets lost in the mix every once in a while. I saw this tour in 1988 and was real pleased to see that it was available on DVD-A (5.1 Advanced Resolution too!!), I always thought that the addition of Steve Morse to the band was brilliant. I know that some of Silverline's ""From The Front Row"" aren't real great but if you are a fan of Kansas this is a great addition for your collection."
2,not what I thought I was getting. Beware,not what I thought I was getting. Beware! was looking for live concert videos which this IS NOT!!!!! Already had the music wanted to see them.
3,By a Democrat who read this book,"As a democrat I read this book to see what the other half are thinking and also to be able to come up with a quick retort to most of nonsense that comes out of the mouths of republicans. This book is a good mix of facts and quotes (although as a democrat i dont think most are true), and should give all you republicans a lot of ammo to use against the local lib as Z.D. said. By the way im a conservative democrat (yes we do exist) and i support the war in iraq and i am also pro-life for all you Z.D. Houghtons out there who think those things are reserved for republicans."
2,Example of how things have changed,"In the 80's after Windham Hill's success with New Age, Narada came and originally had some fine acoustical acts. Things certainly have changed in the new age genre. It's a shame that most ""new age"" music is not as it once was - contemporary instrumental music consisting mostly of acoustical music. Now every Tom, Dick and Harry buys a synthesizer and calls it new age. Old 80's Windham Hill and Narada were once prime examples of how lovely the ""new age"" genre could be. Narada is not the same any longer (neither is Windham Hill under the direction now of someone other than its founder/guitarist William Ackerman). Disc one is good in the sense that you get that old Narada sound but disc two is all flamenco and if you're not into that, you won't like this set. I would save my money and buy one of the other Narada Collections if that is the case."
2,Not enough space.,"The leather case is of Nikon quality- excellent. I am, however, disappointed in the lack of space for the charger & cables. They are not bulky. I would have liked to be able to keep them in the case- especially while traveling. Nikon usually thinks of everything, but didn't this time."
1,Broke within 24 hours,"These headphones accompanied the purchase of a casio LK-300TV keyboard that I received for Christmas. The sound quality was o.k., but not up to par with other manufacturers - the harp sounds were slightly fuzzy unless turned all the way up. Within 1 days use, the left channel was completely shorted out. As they came in a package, I am unable to return them, but will at least share my frustration with them."
5,best I've ever played,"I've played a number of different brand harmonicas, as well as a variety of different Hohners, & I've found that my Meisterklasse outclasses all of the rest. (I've read good things about Yamaha & upper end Huang harps, but I've never played either brand, so I can't comment as to how they compare.) It looks good, feels like a serious instrument, &, most importantly, it is simply easier to play, & sounds better, to boot. Other harps are all well & good for children & hobos, but the Meisterklasse is the real deal. Spend the money."
3,Don't recommend this for a large bird.,"This T-Stand definitely was described as being more sturdy than it actually is. I was misled by the fact that its shipping weight was listed as 30 pounds (it was about one-third that weight) and the fact that it was advertised as having a weighted base. My green wing macaw can sit on the stand, but I would not feel comfortable leaving him on it unattended. This would probably be a good extra or outdoor play stand for a smaller bird."
4,Stork Craft Beatrice Combo Hutch in Natural Stain,"This is a very nice hutch, clean finish and easy to assemble, price was great too! It went with the combo chest!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS COMBO,"We purchased this combo hutch for $119...Great Deal, right? After receiving the Hutch about a week after ordering we called to see where the bottom chest was. At this point Amazon told us that they were mailed in two separate packages and we should receive it within a few days. Well, finally after almost another full week our package came. Another top HUTCH!!!! When we contacted Amazon, they told us that they only carry the top piece and cannot give us what we paid for.... Although the customer service was polite and refunded the order, I now have a top hutch piece that only fits onto a specific chest. The least expensive you can find that chest is $219.00.... So now I will be paying double for what I received.... Amazon should not sell this if they can't fulfill the orders!!!!"
1,Worst mix ever,"These are probably the worst Iraqi mixed songs I've heard. It's an absolute sodomization of Iraqi music and a miserable, failed attempt to mix techno music with traditional Iraqi music. Don't waste your money or time on this one."
2,Disappointed,"Has every feature you could imagine except the one I really wanted and thought I would get-sentence translation. Only after I purchased it did I find out that sentence translation is only available for certain language packs, and the language I bought, Chinese, did not have sentence translation available. Overall this product is not much use to me; an expensive mistake."
3,Not bad,The only problem I have with this is that you can't close the door because of the hooks holding it in place. They are too thick but they are sturdy.
4,Great product,"There is loads of space for all your shoes in this and it saves so much space!! My only quibble is that it struggles with some mens shoes, although a lot do fit in there. Well worth the money"
2,Eh... okay,"I have a closet w/ sliding doors, so my actual bedroom door is the only option to hang it on. Therefore, not being able to close my door is a big problem. What's the point of making it over the door if it hinders the door's purpose?"
4,They Are The Koolest,Well...I luv Mind Driver and I know they're kool. Not only their music but they meaning the guys! Heath and Mike are kool... and I just wanna say if you haven't listened to mind driver lately..YOU SHOULD!
4,I was there,"Well I dont have this yet, but I will very soonIt was a very special nightI joined WFUV for 100 bucks, money well spentto attend the showChristine painted my pinkie with sparkle nail polishon one hand and then insisted she do the other handso I would be balancedI sang SNAG's and had milk + cookiesSee her if you can, and this is a close secondto how good she is........"
1,The Complete Reiki Handbook,"I practice Reiki regularly and will soon recieve my Reiki 2 attunements. I have purchased several excellent books about Reiki as I have prepared for this attunement. This book is NOT one of them. It was disturbing to open the book and discover that all of the illustrations depict people in the nude. The author explains this with a statement that this was done to ""convey the feeling of intimacy. freedom and love which is the very essence of Reiki"". Reiki is a wonderful gift and provides a sense of well being to the reciever. I would RUN if anyone wanted to give me Reiki in the nude. The act of touching someone in the act of healing requires absolute respect for the other person's body and feelings. The ""intimacy"" suggested in this book does not feel right to me. The information shared about the practice of Reiki was not as useful to me as the information shared in other books I have purchased. I do not recommend this book."
5,"Excellent book, for those who believe it!","I would rather delete this review, but since I can't do that, I have to put the truth here as far as I know it at this point in time.Reiki CAN BE a technique to learn about outstanding powers of the body, but it is imperative to grow and to grow out of it again, knowing that all power comes ultimately from the inside-out and never the other way around. There are no ""energies"" tapped into or ""channeled"", coming from somewhere else; there are only powers from the inside out.People don't heal other people. People can only give permission to themselves to be healed, and so be it! If somebody is ""outsourcing"" the power into a so-called Reiki-Practitioner, it is still the permission to be healed that will heal somebody. The strong belief and the placebo-effect open the flood-gates for the healing, which is, after all, still self-inflicted and has nothing to do with rituals called Reiki."
2,there are better ones...,"I was disturbed by the nudity in the book. I can see some sexuality in the drawings. The art is somewhat amateur in the sense that the illustrator tries to draw it in a realistic manner but cannot accomplish at times especially with the male nude.The information is dated. A lot is not about reiki, unless you want to learn about the combination of other usages, so the title of the book should have been different.It is not completely crap but I don't think I would recommend it."
3,gay is beautyful,"Farinetti gives us another example of his skill in building a first-class murder story after Un delitto fatto in casa. Although this new novel lacks the flavour of the piedmontese setting (that probably made the other book unsuitable for every reader out of Piedmont) adds a fascinating volcanic and mediterranean background that makes you eager to head to Stromboli immediately. But the most amusing thing is the Farinetti trademark: all the gay people in this novel (there are plenty) are beautiful, clever, rich and good-hearted. All the so-called straight ones are at the best insignificant. Nice try, anyway."
4,A good product at a fair price,I have put another liftgate support and it lasted only 2 years. This one appears to be built of better quality and was easy to install. You do need one helper to hold the heavy tailgate up as you remove and install the liftgate support.Only time will tell if this is a better quality product. Quick delivery.
1,Artistic talent or privicy invasion?,"I am very open minded about artistic expression,however this film diary of a young man filming a girl of interest without her knowledge was distastful, and more than a little creepy. The single camera work was very poor. A total waste of his time and mine."
5,The Best Art Film made in 21st century!,"This movie is one of the most artistic films which I have ever seen. It reminds me French art film director, Jean-Luc Godard's works. It is very experimental but also very beautiful image and unique filming style.I would say this is the best art film made in 21st century!!!Through this movie, you will experience the solitude of a man who is in love with Japanese lady in Tokyo, Japan.Love, Hate, Pervert, Sex, Drag and Death.... those feelings and images are mixed with an exotic image of Tokyo.It is hard to explain by words but you have to experience this watching this movieAfter you watch this movie, you will find happiness you ever had.I would like to recommend this to everybody who loves a movie in the world."
4,Love the simplicity,"I did hours and hours of research on kits for homebrewing before finally deciding on this one. This is a very simple to follow way to make beer for beginners. I have just used the Coopers kits with it, but I dont think it will be very easy to experiment with our own ingredients, not really set up for that. I will say the parts are a little difficult to clean and out ""little bottler"" leaks like crazy when we bottle, it is definetly a 2 person job for us.I have a friend that purchased the Mr. Beer kit at the same time we bought our Coopers kit and in a taste test the Mr. Beer had a lot more flavor but that is the ingredients put in the beer more that the kit itself to make the beer. I would definetly recommend this for someone starting off learning how to brew beer, but not for an experienced brewmaster."
5,Exactly as Promised,"For years I've been thinking ""one of these days I'd like to brew some beer"" and I finally decided to take the plunge when I saw the reviews for the Coopers Brewery Micro Brew Beer Kit.Everything (everthing) you need to brew your first batch of beer is included, except water (from your tap) and household bleach (you'll need about a pint in total to clean the equipment.)If I never go further than the Coopers ""beer in a can"" process, I'll still be making my own beer for about $6/gallon. And if I get into more involved processes, all the equipment in the kit is perfectly suited to further brewing adventures.I am very satisfied!"
5,my husband is thrilled,I bought this as a gift for my husband; it was easy for him to use and the beer came out great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to start brewing their own beer.
4,A good place to start.,"My fiance bought this for me for my birthday. I had done some research online and had hinted that this was the kit for me. With other kits such a Mr Beer you have no room to grow into the hobby, not to mention the questionable quality of the kit itself. With the Coopers kit you get everything you need to start the hobby of homebrewing, and you can always add equipment if you decide to continue. The quality of the kit so far as been excellent, although my bottle filler did drip a bit. I did expect that so placing a small towel under the bottle is a good idea, again it was a small drip.The starter ingredients are bascially idiot proof, just pour in the can and brewing sugar, add some hot water, add in some cool water then the yeast...then the waiting game. Coopers website has quite a few options as far as varieties go. I plan on using the kit at least one more time to get a good feel, then starting more complex recipes.Anyway this is the kit to get."
1,Didn't carbonate,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and we were really excited about this. We have friends into beer making and he had always wanted to brew beer so we were hoping this would get us familiar with the process. We followed the simple instructions and when the time had come we tried the beer and it was horrible. No carbonation, it was just flat, nasty beer. So disappointed. :("
3,DIY Beer Kit,"Purchased this a while back as a gift for a beer enthusiast friend. They were not overly successful in producing drinkable beer. The bottles included with the set were not consistent in shape, and didn't seem to seal well. It was an interesting experiment, but not successful."
2,might not be for you,"If you are using this as a starting point and don't mind buying all new equipment after a couple batches, then the equipment might be for you.The fermenter is not air tight and lets light in.The only thing I will continue to use is the spoon. I've already bought all new equipment.Also do not follow their directions for making beer, they get several things wrong. Your bee could turn out ok, but it could be sooo much better if you followed some standard brewing techniques. Try ""How to Brew"" by John Palmer or ""Homebrewing for Dummies"" for instructions. An example would be not to sprinkle dry yeast on top of your wort. Dry yeast should be rehydrated first. Even though cooking isn't necessary it should still be done.""How to Brew"" mentions Coopers a few times as quality ingredients though.This is my first review. I hope I save some people money by going right to a good kit. Check your local homebrew shops to see if they have kits."
5,Great item- Highly recommend this for an intro to brewing,"Fast Delivery, good instructions, complete and easy to use. I left my first batch in for an extra week before bottling per some comments on some home brew sites. Bottling was a breeze with the spigot attachment. I now have a second batch in that required boiling and adding hops. I cant wait to see how that turns out."
5,Great fun and great tasting beer!,"I bought this kit for as a gift last year and my boyfriend liked it so much that he ordered more mix kits. I did a lot of research on beer kits before buying, because I didn't want to get anything too cheap that would be like a Mr. Beer kit and taste bad. I also wanted it to be a little challenging, but not make my boyfriend feel like he had to be a scientist to get the beer to come out correctly.The instruction video that comes with the kit is pretty funny and we watched it a few times just for laughs. Everything you need is included in the kit, but we bought an extra room thermometer to make sure that the room was at the optimal temp for brewing.It was also cool to notice that the beer changed taste over time after the brewing is complete. My boyfriend gave out bottles of the brew co-workers, guest, etc I think because there was a total pride behind saying that is was HIS own beer."
4,Worked a treat - beer is totally delicious!,"This kit works a treat. I am still drinking the beer from my first batch and now shopping for supplies for more of the same. It's better than commercial brews and very satisfying. The only problem with my kit was that the airlock didn't seal due to an extra ridge of plastic from the manufacturing. However the CO2 from the fermentation prevented any outside air getting in. My one wish: glass bottles with caps, instead of plastic bottles! But hey, it's all about the beer and the beer itself is exquisite, like a sweetish pale ale with a thick, creamy head and a slight yeasty aroma. Goes down SO EASY! Oh yes, if Australian means Foster's to you, don't expect that this compares. Although both are lagers and I was always a Foster's fan, the Cooper's Lager has more body and is more flavorful."
4,Delightful!,Bought this book because my son was a truck driver...fulfilled its promise! very entertaining and informative. You will smile throughout.
5,Great book good service,Excellent book in great shape brought back a lot of fond memories for my mom whos been driving for 16 years
2,Jills opinion,"I have eaten in a lot of truckstops and find the food genrally good. I tried seven recipes in this book, to the letter (no alterations) and none of them tasted like the original delights."
5,"GOLO - The most addicting, coolest golf games ever!","I am a GOLO adddict, I admit it. This is the most addicting game I have ever played & I couldn't disagree more with the review above. I also used to play Yahtzee and there is a ton more strategy to GOLO, especially if you are playing against others... should you play safe and pull pars, should you go for birdies and eagles, call bottoms?? What he/she doesn't get is that if you know golf, there is strategy to GOLO. Also, the best part of this game is that it is simple, fast, and you dont have to think to much. You can shoot a 9 hole round in about 1- 2 minutes. It is also the perfect party game especially at the bar & especially if you want to gamble. I was fortunate enough to attend a GOLO US OPEN party in Orlando at the PGA SHOW and everyone had the time of their life. If you want a first hand account of how addicting the game is, go and play on their website at www.igolo.com"
1,wrong age group,"This game was for young children only, not adults. I missinterpreted the game use as for adults also. Did not like it for adults, gave it away."
1,Bad History,"This story has some serious issues. Mary Jemison was taken from her home by the Shawnee and then traded to the Seneca where she was adopted by two Seneca sisters. It was not her wedding morning, she was a child."
2,Whatever happened to suspense?,After reading the first book and liking it I was gravely dissapointed with the sequel to it. Caroline Cooney has been known for her suspense novels but after reading this you would not of thought that. The book is more like a soap opera. A few good chapters here and there but that is about it. This book as convinced me not to read the third and fourth one.
4,A MYSTERIOUS BOOK,Whever happend to Janie? is a great book about a fifteen year old girl that has to leave her family that she grew up with to live with her real family. I liked this book because I enjoy mystery stories. I also like it because there is a sequel. The last reason I liked this book is I felt Iike I was really in the book. I would suggest this book to a friend if they liked The Face On The Milk Carton.When I say friend it could be an adult or a child.
4,review,i loved this book and could not put it down. the only reason i gave it a 4 insted of a 5 was because it kinda lacked the mystery that got me hooked on this series. wish i could spare 7.99 and get the next book. :(
5,Whatever Happened to Janie,I loved this book. It was so good I couldn't stop reading it. I'm already buying the third book!! I gave it five stars because it had romance and a mystery.Great book!!!
4,Love And Tears,"Love shines through the people in this book. Tears glow when a broken family reunites after years and years.Janie finds her family by seeing her face on the milk carton. Both famlies are torn by Janie's decision. Not understanding Janie is what both families have in common, but you can see the chaotic and confusion and where she stands.A family she has thought was her own and a life a dream could accomplish. A loving family she has never known but it was her real parents, sister, and brothers.Janie's big decision may lead her life in a whole different way or it may let her stay the same old way."
2,Just What You Expect,"This book is about a girl who discovers that she was kidnapped at three years old. It is a very predictable book, however would be a good read for someone who needs to experience a situation like this. It is easy to relate to her in both situations: as the child taken away from the family she's known all her life and also in the role of being a new member of a family of strangers."
5,This is a perfect example of sequels being better.,"This is a great book with a deeper, more relatable plot than the first book of the series. It has a fantastic plot with many interesting twists and turns throughout to keep you on your toes. The character development is very intricate and gives you a clear sense of each character's personality. It's definetly a winner!"
3,Whatever Happened To Janie?,This book is okay. It went sort of slow. And I if I was her I would of told them that I didn't like it there after the first week. But overall it was a good book. When the ending comes it's like thank god!! I would recommend this to ages 12 and up and to people who like mysteries.
4,Janie Johnson/Jennie Spring,"This is the one book that makes you sooo happy you have 1 set of parents. In this book Janie/Jennie say's she doesn't have enough love to go around. With a new life, a new school, and a new family all at once it is going to be really hard for her to learn to share a small house and a big family, when living a big house and small family for 12 years. This book tells how hard it is with 2 sets of parents and how she can't make both sets happy.Janie/Jennie is a real stubern 15 year old. This book is soooo good. everyone who reads it should be happy with 1 set of parents"
5,my review on Whatever happend to Janie,"This is a realy good book!When i started to read it I was hooked.It's about a girl named Janie and her life after she found out that she was kiddnapped by Hannah Javenson.She goes to live with her birth parents and she finds out that she does not want live with them anymore.So she goes back to her old family and starts to regret that to.She soon relizes that she does not know where to live.Should she live with her birth parents or should she live with her ""fake"" parents?She soon makes her dicition.....!You have to read this book to find out what happens to Janie Johnson after she makes her amazing dicition.I would recomend this book to anyone who loves to read about love stories and adverture books."
3,"Great read, Yet less interesting than first book...","Yes, Whatever Happened To Janie was an eventful page-turner. Though, if you have read The Face on the Milk Carton, you may agree with me as i found that it was more suspensful. I enjoyed the first one more. I stopped reading this great 4 part novel set at this book because i believed that the last two would only involve simple repition. By all means, read the Whatever Happened To Janie, it is an extraordinary book."
2,"I really like May, but sheesh...","I have almost nothing good to say about this book. the story is okay and the world is nor horrible. other than that, the entire book is pretty dismal. The writing is especially bad. I would never have guessed May wrote it. the dialogs are forced and unconvincing. The drive of the characters is not well explained or understood. even the main characters are pretty flat and uninteresting. the end is somewhat climactic, but falls very short of being epic. Worst of all, its hard to sympathize or like the proctagonists. in some parts of the book i was actually rooting for the evil guy because he was so pathetic and had such rotten luck."
1,May should go back to the Pliocene!,"This novel had a fascinating world and an intriguing system of magic and sorcery.But the story itself was weak, and the characters uninteresting.I've read and loved everything else May has written, but this series just stinks to high heaven."
2,This book is so old it is useless. Just a curiosity,"I would imagine that at the time of its writting this book was great. However, times have changed and now neither the mannerisms, vocabulary, phrases or even pronounciations contained within are applicable."
5,Enthralling,"I too bought this book because I so enjoyed reading Mr Chrenkoff's blog. I don't read much fiction at all and so I knew this would be a stretch for me. And it was. However, it was rewarding. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I had to work at it at first as I'm not used to reading fiction and the storyline had a typical ""fiction"" feel to it, the way characters were introduced and scenes set up... but as I got my balance I was able to really enjoy it and flew through it in a couple of days (ok, I was home sick with a cold) .Good job Arthur. I look forward to your next book. (and I still check your blog once and again to see if you'll start posting again...)"
2,Terrible strap,"I've always liked the features of the Ironman, and the watch itself is still good. The velcro strap, however, doesn't work well and comes undone, even on a new watch. Worse still, the new design only allows for OEM replacement straps. I think this one will be returned."
4,Does anybody know where to find a band for this watch?,I have had this watch for a year or two and I like it a lot. Only issue I have with it is the band broke and I cannot find a replacement. I believe the Voguestrap TX65E901 or the Timex Men's Q7B808 bands might work. If you have any experience replacing the band for this watch please let me know.
5,Timex watch review,"I use the watch while at work. It has easy to read numbers, etc. The settings are not as intuitive as I would like but once set, the watch is fine. It's also a very good value."
2,It does the basics...,"But I bought a slightly cheaper type of the Ironman back in 2001 (Lost it!) that did so, So much more. I could input a chain of timed minutes with the older version that has disappeared that I used for running and I do still miss that. If that option still exists, it isn't with a watch with a Velcro strap now!Why does all the Good useful stuff sell back in the past with all these limp horrors of the now that I must suffer through?"
3,Sprout Garden,the sprouting trays work as they should however I think they take up room and are messy. I switched to using mason jars with the sprouting lid instead.
1,sprout garden,"Misleading description, I thought from the picture that you could pour water through the top hole, but you have to take it apart each time and water and drain. It is unwieldy to stack."
4,awesome sprouter,"This is an awesome sprouter. I like that the trays stack, and it honestly doesn't take up too much counter space. I also like that it came with different seeds for me to try out. I started with the alfalfa and they were delicious."
4,Happy with my sprouter,"So far my sprouter has been great. The biggest problem I had in the beginning was that the instructions were not clear to me at all. I am currently sprouting mung beans and the instructions say to use a cup of beans. That was way too much. I had to divide the beans over two separate trays and it is still too much. The alfalfa sprouts turned out great. Again the problem was that in one place on the instructions it said to use 1 1/2 tbsp. and in another it said 2 1/2 tablespoons. Of course I used 2 1/2 and it was way too much again. The instructions also say to cover the sprouts and in the next sentence, they say it is not necessary to cover the sprouts. I just need clearer instructions. The chart is very vague as well. The headings are not specific enough, so I had trouble understanding what each column was trying to tell me. Other than instruction problems, the actual sprouter has been great. It has just been a trial and error type thing."
4,Herb Garden,"A neat little herb garden. Comes with six seed packets and four pots, was not sure which packets to choose. It is very clean, as they use a treated sponge to grow the seeds instead of dirt. For a simple little herb garden, with very little fuss or mess, this is perfect."
2,Happy,I got this item at a goodwill and haven't opened the box. Things kinda rattle around inside but for 4 bucks hey I can eat the seeds right? Thanks Chia!
4,Great Product,"Get this-- NOT the clapper!! Stay far away from the clapper.I have had this item twice so far, for people who love being outside this beat the winter blues.. this year I hope to move the herbs outside!"
1,Contradiction in description,"""Product Features"" is different from Product Description.Former:Says""3 sponges, 3 saucers, ..."" etc.Latter:""The complete kit includes: four 3-inch terra cotta pots, four matching saucers, four plastic saucer liners, four Chia Growing Sponges,...."""
2,Ehh,"I'm not sure if it was me (I may have over-fertilized) or the product, but one did not grow at all (chives) and two died after they sprouted (basil and dill).I would just use traditional methods to grow.There is no need in spending money for something questionable."
3,So Far So Good,"My kit came with only 3 clay pots, 3 clay saucers, and 2 (was supposed to have 3!) plastic liners and 6 packs of seeds. I planted parsley, basil, & cilantro. All have come up after about 4 weeks and seem to be doing fine. My complaint is that I'm going to need to replant them which means purchasing more pots and potting soil. I could have purchased big enough pots and seeds myself and saved the money of the kit. I'm not mad at the mfgr, but could just kick myself for not realizing that the plants would require repotting. Also, if you don't have a south facing window, I wouldn't recommend. My kitchen window faces north, so every a.m. before work I move them to another window. I left them in the kitchen window one night and woke up to half dead plants."
1,Total Waste,"I would actually give this product less than one star...I received a Gourmet Chia Herb Garden kit as a gift. I'm in my mid 50s and been growing plants (both outside and inside) all my life. Thought this kit would be a fun thing to do, but what a disappointment it was. I followed all instructions to the letter and after several weeks of seeing only very little growth and then the start of plants declining, I ended up throwing the whole thing away. Don't waste your money on this item. Total waste of money and time :-("
1,Disappointing!!,"Saw this at my local CVS on sale after Christmas for around $6. Decided to try it. Was very disappointed with the product. I followed the instructions in the package to the letter but it has been 2 months later and still nothing has grown. Could not tell if they were old because no expiration date on the package but I have used morning glory seeds that were 2 years past ""expiration"" and they grew perfectly. Plus not all of the seed types were in it, was missing Dill. So bought some American seed brand at walmart for 20 cents. The only thing not wasteful was the small terracotta pots it came with. I will stick to old fashioned planted seeds with soil and not trust this type of stuff again!!"
1,Worthless,Heartbreaking to watch my wife coddle these plants only to see the spindly seedlings die. Followed the directions to the letter. Everyone we talk to says they experienced the same. The positive reviews must be from people that happened to get fresh seeds.
5,love this,"My 6 year old granddaughter loves gardening and we introduced her to our herb garden. She was so taken by it that we let her pick herbs and cook with them. I didn't come with oregano, her favorite because it smells like pizza, but we bought a packet of seeds so she could grow her own. She was very excited to have her own herb garden."
1,Very dissapointed,"I did everything I was suppose to do, and I came up with nothing. I was so dissapointed. I was looking forward to growing my own herbs. What a waste."
1,DOA,"I take pride myself with being good with plants. I tried these because I like the idea of having them grow in the kitchen window. To put it simply, save your money. Only the sweet basil grew and it was stunted and barely there. Lesson learned. This was a high price for 3 pots and some DOA seeds."
2,They don't grow as show in the photo at all.,"It's been over 4 weeks since I planted the seeds following the packaged insturction, but they are growing as it's promised. I made sure each pot gets enough water and sun but 2 of the 4 I planted didn't even germinate at all... :("
2,Not the chia I remember,"I got this for myself and a friend for christmas. Mine took a month or so to sprout, I had almost given up! Finally something! Well it has been almost three months and I still dont have anything that is over two inches high. Not impressed. I want to eat the herbs. I did give two stars for cuteness. I never would have bought anything chia in my adult life to display in my home otherwise!!!My friends has yet to sprout!"
3,Plants don't really grow,"I got these kits for my mother and mother-in-law, and they dutifully planted and tended the herbs as per directions. Some of the herbs grew, and some never came up at all, and some just died. It was probably something that could have been fixed by someone who really knows gardening, but then the kit shouldn't be marketed as an easy-to-grow herb garden, either."
1,Started out great but......,"At first the plants sprouted & grew quickly but I just lost the 3rd of 4 plants.....it appears to be powdery mildew or something similar. I first lost the cilantro, then the parsley went next....I figured since they were similar plants, they probably shared their fate but then the basil, which had been doing GREAT, started shrivelling.....so this has been a total waste of money!"
5,Ch..ch...ch...Chia,"I always buy Chia Herb Gardens for gifts and relabel the packets to make it a ""Goodness Garden"".... The recipient loved it."
1,Chia Herb Garden - don't bother,"We did everything right, and nothing ever grew. Don't bother.I gave it a 1 star, because the rating page made me pick at least one to get onto the next page."
2,What a waste,This herb garden died faster than the time I spent researching it. The greens were fairly weak and didn't really get a chance to grow. Just dried up. I liked the pots and would have reused them had my husband not thrown them out.
