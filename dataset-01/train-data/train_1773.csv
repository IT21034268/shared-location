1,This Could Be Helpful,"This book may, in fact, prove to be helpful. If The Bush Crime Syndicate continues on its present course with the help of their slavish cabal of hard right-wing, semi-comatose loonies and fascist war-mongering idealogues, The World as we know it may change quite dramatically in the next few years making it necessary for us to find alternative sources of energy to heat our homes. This book would make an excellent source of kindling for your fireplace or a emergency substitute for toilet paper."
1,More reading you'll love,"If you liked this book, you'll love ""It Can't Happen Here"" by Sinclair Lewis, ""1984"" by George Orwell, and ""Mein Kampf"" by Adolf Hitler. If you can't read, try the Audio Books. Warning, only buy if you are able to listen to someone other than President Bush talk."
1,Pure unadulterated Fascism,"If you favor the USA's flirtation with Fascism you'll love this book. If Fascism is not your cup of tea, read it anyway...and fight like hell to prevent the complete loss of our country to the extreme rightwing."
4,norma/callas etc,"Food for thought: Callas was first and foremost an ACTING singer, and was instrumental in transforming the world of opera from static singers to acting singers. As others have said her voice, as every other singer out there, had pros and cons. She was NOT a contralto (go listen to Marian Anderson or Kathleen Ferrier, for goodness'sake). What did happen is that a) she lost a lot of weight at one point because of personal life (Onassis), which is not neutral on the voice. And b) she sang probably too frequently, and often roles requiring very different qualities, which is why her career did not indeed last as long as some other singers out there."
3,The problem here is Bonynge,"If you are a fan of this opera, you of course must get this recording. The vocal feats of Sutherland and Horne are unparalleled in recordings of this opera...However, you cannot let this be your only Norma because the conducting is so slack and dull. Guerra, Guerra fails (too slow), and at other points the melodies don't come through because Bonynge is just taking them way too slowly. Almost any other recording, including Sutherland's later one from the 80s, with an older, better Bonynge, will give you a better feel for the rhythms of this wonderful opera."
5,Simply the best version available.,"Don't get me wrong for I own both of Maria Callas' studio recordings of this opera, and regard both as indispensable, not just for her vocalization but especially for the dramatic and psychological insights she brings to the opera. But this 1963 recording, (superbly remastered on 3 mid priced CD's with the libretto including on the first disc as a CD-ROM) with Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne, has an aural beauty too few rarely realized in opera recordings. Of course it helps that both singers have voices that sound like what I can only imagine angels must sound like. Bonynge's conducting has not quite the dramatic urgency that Serafin brings to the Callas recordings, but with these two voices who cares. How does one choose? You don't, save your pennies and own all of them."
5,Can't get much better than straight from the source,"When preparing for your GMAT you want to try to practice with questions that are as close as possible to what you'll see on Test Day. The Official Guide is full of them! Although this book won't give you much in terms of advice (check out a Kaplan or PR book for this), it will give you plenty of opportunity to test your skill level. Using this in conjunction with one of the books mentioned above is a very effective method of getting ready. Good luck to all on your test!"
2,Poor,The math questions are much too easy--easier than you find on the real GMAT. The verbal sections give an accurate picture of the difficulty level one encounters on the real thing.
5,A must-read,"I have read a number of books on GMAT, and this is the only one that contains real GMAT questions, not those weird, simulated questions. This book helps you to establish a correct understanding of the difficulty level of GMAT questions. Also, with the detailed explanations of each question and the authority of ETS, it certainly qualifies itself as a must-read among so many books on GMAT."
5,Official is Real,It is very important to practice the Real test papers before taking the actual GMAT exams.
3,"This is the real thing, but little help to the Gmat novice.","I find this book extremely helpful because of the verisimilitude: this IS the real thing, with questions used in real ETS GMAT tests. What i do not appreciate about it is that many of the explanations are deliberately awkward and unclear."
5,Perfect,"I have been looking for the perfect flip-up for my son's small eyeglasses, since clip-ons are loo big to fit such small eyeglasses with those leg grabbers, and this was the only one that had ones that fit his prescription eyeglasses, the 51mm x 29mm were great, just a bit larger at the sides, but fits great, I just wanted to protect his eyes from the sun's uv rays and the glare which bathers him, and I finally found them, for such small glasses, they have to be flip ups to fit, they do work, because you just clip them on in the middle and that's it.Thanks VS Eyewear."
2,Too light for sun light,"My eye doctor recommended that I purchase snap on sun glasses rather than use the prescription type. It is very difficult to get a good fit for existing glasses if you don't have them in hand.The plastic is thin and flimsy--the dark part to cover the lens is not large enough to cover the lenses, and though convenient don't do the job. I was disappointed and later purchased better, more expensive glasses elsewhere. They are cheap--but you get what you pay for."
2,Too Narrow,"This pair of flip-ups left something to be desired - more than a quarter inch of uncovered space on each side of my glasses and a clip so narrow that my nosepads prevent it from clipping on properly. I have what I consider to be a very average pair of glasses, so perhaps it would function for a narrower style. Otherwise the sunglasses appeared workable, though I returned them immediately and never wore them outside."
5,Amazing man amazing story,"Great read, in fact I have read it three times. Wayne Short has led an amazing life and tells part of it in this book. After his service in WWII he moved with his family to the Alaska back country. He has battles with bears, weather and Indians and manages to come out on top, just like his great uncle gunfighter Luke Short. I highly recommend this to anyone interested outdoors and history."
1,Warning - Not As Advertised!,"I purchased the 03150 laser over similar models from competitors because of Stabila's reputation for quality and precision. I also liked the fact it was advertised as ""Made in Germany"" and came with a Two-year warranty.The first thing I noticed when I read the manufacturer's packaging is that it actually only comes with a One-year warranty. Then I discovered ""Made in Malaysia"" conveniently hidden under the Amazon inventory tracking label.As for quality and precision, the laser dot has a distracting series of three concentric arches emanating above and below it as well as several dashed lines to each side that are clearly out of level. At a distance of 20', the straight beam and 90 degree beam were at least 1/16"" off from each other when aimed at the same point.Overall, I felt misled and decided to return it."
2,Not what I expected.,"This bag is not what I expected. I use it to carry my Marlin 336 scoped back and forth and it's a very, VERY tight fit. I end up having to close the case halfway and then shoving the gun inside. The case is 43"" and the 336 is 38.5"" so it should have worked out better. I might get something else..."
5,Awesome Gun Case.!!!,"I was very pleased when I got this case a few days ago and my rifle fits perfectly, like a glove..I own a Ruger 10/22 Carbine and I wasn't exacly for sure how it would fit with my Swiss Arms 4x32 Rifle Scope mounted on it..I had read another review and it had said it fit with his 4x32 but was a little tight zipping it up..Mine fits great with about less than a half inch to spare..It is a really nice case for the money, very well padded and the handle is very well stitched..I also like the silk screened graphics on it, the tin cans and the tree stumps.. The Allen Company are very well known for putting out such fine products and this one is just as nice as some of the other ones from different company's that I had looked at before purchasing this one.. Definitely no complaints here and a very satisfied customer.."
5,This is one of Carmen's best,Carmen is awesome on this album!! He did a really good job on the tune and on the title itself every song clearly states our mission! Every one should listen to this he has every kind of music on it. I can't wait to see his tour.
5,This is GREAT!,"Hi, At first I was a Rock kind of music person. But then one of my best friends fired this CD up and I turned to a Christian Rock music person! Let the LORD rule and Only him!"
4,SECOND TO BEST,"Second to best. I like the CD ""the standerd"" much better. But it is still one of the best! I love the ""Song"" THE COURT ROOM. my friend's church did it as a play. it is a very good CD, but I recomend ""the standerd"" or ""A2J""(addited to JESUS)"
5,An Awesome Spirit filled CD.,"This CD totally moves me when I hear it Carman is such a Spirit filled man. I'm hoping he is just as good at his concert on 8/10/99, at my hometown. Hope to meet the man. Keep pushing out those tunes."
5,TERRIFIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,his best cd ever.if your a carman fan then you will love this cd.it is carman at his best.again it is great and is worth spending your money on.terrific keep up the good work carmen!
3,Prescription for the 'Bloomer's' Blues,"Gone is the lightning fast, stinging, high voltage licks which was Bloomfield's prescription for living with the blues. He, originally gave us all that script, for living in dark times. Sadly, while there are still some traces of that to be found, hence making this worth buying, you can feel his decline in the unevenness of the selections and his playing. However, he has earned our forgiveness and and benefit of the doubt. Those who were infected by his early playing, and his contribution to the blues legacy, will wanna take the cure, and get a little more of the guy who Was Born in Chicago, Worked on Maggie's Farm, and who came from the East & left in the West. You'll find things to love."
3,Too sweet.,"This book has good stories about how raw food can help your health, but the recipes concentrate way too much on sweets."
1,One of the worst pieces of writing ever,"I agree with ""The Reader""'s review. I can't believe the authors really wrote this book. I wanted to give up a few pages into the reading but since I had spent my money (unwisely) on buying one instead of (wisely) renting it, I plowed through to the end. The dialogues are laughably artificial, the plot is moronic, and the cliches make the reading pure torture. Please avoid this book like the plague. Spend your time and money elsewhere. I wish I could give this a negative 5 stars but 1 is the lowest I am allowed to go."
1,...but I liked it better the first time,I was really looking forward to this book since I have always been a fan of their previous collaborations particularly the novel THE FIFTH HORSEMAN.Lo and behold! this is a lowbudget update remake of that book right down to the scene where the mayor of New York tells the President that he will not stay in Washington while his city is in jeopardy.The addition of real names to fictional characters does not a new book make.Read THE FIFTH HORSEMAN - they did it better the first time around.
1,Cartoonishly simplistic,"I was hoping for some new ideas, or even some interesting guessing about what would happen if New York City really was threatened with an atomic bomb. But the book jacket was as deep as this book got."
5,"Marcia, Owls Head NY","This Madama Butterfly is wonderful---I had forgotten how magnificent Renata Tebaldi's voice was and Bergonzi is one of my favorites---cool,clean, powerful and oh, so moving. Highly reccomend !"
2,Great for one use ONLY,"This is a really lovely suit. Thick plush material, nice large size, beard is better than most, lined well, boots look great and can fit over pretty much any size shoe.It is, of course very, very hot. Santa sweated through in two and a half hours and the suit was literally wet to the touch. I took it home and hand washed it according to the instructions and the trim has now turned pink. Bright, beautiful, lovely PINK!I will probably remove the trim, wash the suit several times until the water no longer turns pink, and then replace it, but this is a lot of work. Be prepared or just assume you will only get one use from it.And don't forget, you will need gloves and maybe a bag for his presents!"
2,Not too nuch quality,"When the suit came to me the zipper was already coming un-sewn. Also the beard that comes with it is also pretty cheap and will need to be modified prior to wearing. Shoe covers are very small, I barely fit in them and weigh only 160 lbs. Looks OK otherwise"
4,"A great recording, but not his best.","This one has the same big production style that ""naufragios"" had. And it works, the opener ""a pleno sol"" is as catchy a tune as any of them. Also ""selena"", ""puedo dormir..."" have that anthemic rock sound. The one tune that sticks out the most in my mind is ""en el trampolin"" which is like an ambient jazzy tune...that was fairly expiremental for Mikel and it's the best song on the record. Also ""carrusel"" reminds me of the ""abrazo del erizo"" cd as it is distorted and they throw in a marry go round like sound at parts(for some reason this song reminds me of smashing pumpkins in spanish). Otherwise this cd is slightly weaker than ""naufragios"" but I still reccomend it, cuz Mikel Erentxun is the best pop/rock performer and always puts out quality recordings."
5,Brilliant Tool for the Serious Practitioner,"This book offers sound principles of work-on-self, without the pseudo-mysticism and self-centered ""feel-good"" approaches of so much of contemporary self-help psychology and divinatory toys. One is challenged to tell a deeper level of truth about one's own motivations and to see one's present level of maturity. The path is laid out clearly, and the steps from naive ignorance to conscious participation and service are reflective of the way offered by the great spiritual traditions. This book is not for those who want to play with Tarot, but for those who want to genuinely use this brilliant tool."
4,Just keep telling yourself it's the inside that counts,"It's the Bible, and the only English version of the Bible that's TRUE to some of the oldest, trust translations in our tongue. The facsimile is absolutely gorgeous, and it feels like you're taking a step back in time every time you open the covers. However, the actual outside of the Bible is what gets to me. The front cover is stamped with HUGE 48-point font HOLY BIBLE 1611 EDITION etcetera... This doesn't really match with the historical feel of what's inside. But overall this is my new favorite Bible and something I'm sure people at my church will love to see (since finding Bibles with the Apocrypha is quite difficult but they are the standard in the Episcopal Church)."
5,Great Read,"This book analyzed the english language and its words from historical, morphological, phonetic, and other perspectives. A great read for anyone with linguistic knowledge or an English buff. Not dense at all; explains linguistic technical terms for the beginner."
5,An Excellent Read,I thoroughly enjoyed Ms Wilson's writing. Finally we have a book that represents this long over-looked figure in American history. Bridget Bishop was a woman unfairly persecuted in a wave of colonial histeria. Now her story can be told.
2,WITCH -- a bit disappointing,"After waiting a long time for this book to become available on a book-trading website, scouring the used bookstores for it, and combing the library catalog, I finally broke down and bought a new copy. I read about 20 pages and realized I was forcing myself to go on. It wasn't particularly entertaining or enlightening, in fact those 20 pages were pretty boring. I put it aside and will grab it again, maybe I'll read the middle or end sections first and see if it gets better. I was very surprised to be underwhelmed by this one!"
1,Written for the stage--shouldn't be a novel,"If you're looking for over the top writing that would be better suited for a monologue on a stage--in an elementary school gymnasium--complete with velvety dress and a pointed hat with foil stars. I've lived in Salem, MA and seen ridiculous displays of foolery, and this fits right in with the rest of the kitsch. A useless waste of time for any reader older than 10.Also, the author spent a bit of time living in Seattle, where the first five-star review hails from; anyone want to bet they know one another?"
1,Don't treat me like a child!,"I only got through the first few chapters of the book before I was so OFFENDED I had to stop. The author clearly believes she is speaking to an immature and unintelligent audience. This is what cinched it for me:""At lower status law schools, the students of both genders are often the first generation of their families to get a higher education, and even a modest middle-class life seems good to them"" (14). Why beat up your readers, Hirshman? I happen to be a first generation law student who is very displeased with the attitude of the book. I do not reccomend this for anyone."
3,fact/fiction,"Well as some of the book maybe true and some just added for the sake of the story , I had to laugh about people calling each other ""dude "" in 1969 .I'm also not sure how you get promoted from e-3 to e-5 after one patrol.But its not a bad read ,its certainly not Philip Caputo ,just an entertaining book that just needs to be taken as half adventure story ,half true life ."
3,Good read,"I think gibbore has a good story to tell. You want good writingtry Shakespere, The book reads like a guy at the bar tellingwar stories--do I belive everything he says not really--but hegives us missions, schools and characters that are interesting.Hey compared to the slick self serving books on Viet Nam thisis grass roots,salt of the earth stuff."
4,Awesome,These songs are awesome and wish he had more cds out like this one....but all his cds are cool and has a kentucky country feel to them....
5,vhs movie,purchased it to complete my set of the series...loved it..it was funny from the beginnig to the end..would recommend it to anyone who loves a good cartoon...
4,More politics of Jackie Presser than anything else.,"When begining to read this book, one might think that itis a biography of Presser. However, it is more a consideration of the politics of Presser and the politics that came to characterize the Teamsters over the years. The main problem with this approach is that at times the writing seems superficial and soap opera-esque. It can be rather annoying. In the end, the book is good for a leasure read, but not for a scholarly look at labor institutions.Bob ParksRockhurst College"
5,So relaxing!!,"I bought the CD for a gift and I found out why my brother loves it. I put it on my ipod and now I can listen to it too.Dianne, Indianapolis, In."
1,hate it,"At first I loved Farberware I purchased the whole set. I now have had the set for about three years and guess what. You guessed it. The set is peeling and sticking in spots, just like all of those low quality sets. I paid a lot of money for this whole set. I thought I was geting quality merchadise. I have know found out differently. I saw on TV where another person was dissappointed and the TV station put her in touch with the company. I think I am going to call the station too. You can not even find the company telephone number or address to call and complain. If anyone does know how, or where I can call and send this mess back to, please let me know.dissappointed in Michigan"
1,Really Bad Quality,I was definately expecting more from a name like Farberware. These were really flimsy pans- the kind you might buy at the grocery store. Thankfully I got them free as part of a promotion because if I had to pay for them they would have gone right back!
4,It works good for me!,"i just love the small fry pan!!!!Its a great size when cooking for one.The thing i realize with aluminum is that you have to use low - medium heat and not high. It will burn your food it you don't control the temp of the pan. So far i have used the smallest pan several times with great results and the larger fry pay to make eggs that came out great!I am planning on using the griddle to make pancakes soon,faberware is a brand i trust and have used before and i think with proper use you should get great results. Instructions does come with the pans."
1,...,"The handles on this thing are cheap, and the pans so light that they quickly burn your food. When the box came, I thought it must be empty, but found three pans in it - they are that light. If you are thinking of giving these as a gift, dont. They are shrinkwrapped in platic and are not presentable. Not a good buy."
3,Beware of translations,"This book was originally written in French and then translated into English. Considering the subject of this book is Japan, that's probably not the best way to go about things. Many of the Japanese words introduced in this book are written as they would be transcribed in French, not English, leading to possible confusion. In addition, the translation is at times not very good. The text gets quite clunky and seems poorly organized in places. The one thing this book has going for it is the abundance of high quality photographs. Visually, this book is stunning, filled with lots of slick, high-gloss images. So buy this book for the pictures, but if you're actually going to read it, beware the information. There are many other books that are much better."
3,Not sure what I got!,"I ordered these earrings and the invoice indicated 1) Round Aqua CZ stud and 2) Genuine Blue Topaz. So what did I really get? They're ok for the price, but would like to know what I'm buying!"
4,Not Bad!!!,"My mom is a big Monkees fan, but I think they're okay. The only song I like that they sing is I'm a Believer. For a long time, I've loved this song. If you are a Monkees fan, you'll love THE MONKEES GREATEST HITS!!!"
2,OK...But there are better Monkees,"This is an odd collection to call ""Greatest Hits"". It doesn't contain a complete collection of singles... Its debatable whether an album-only track like 'I Wanna Be Free' deserves inclusion over say, 'For Pete's Sake', or 'Cuddly Toy'. Likewise, 'D.W. Washburn' -- which was assuredly never a hit -- stands out from the rest of the tracks like a pothole in the road.If you?re a completist, you may want to buy this if only because its the only single disc that contains 'Washburn' and 'Its Nice To Be With You'.If you?re looking for a single-disc collection of the best Monkees songs, go for 'Best of The Monkees"" which has 25 songs on one disc, and a much more balanced selection of songs that represented The Monkees's best work from their original run."
4,"Not All The Essentials, But All The Essential Essentials","As we have seen through numerous attempts since 1969 (the year of the Monkees' very first 'hits' collection ever released), the Monkees simply had too many charted hits and equally famous album cuts to be covered in a single collection, so no one-disc set could ever give you all the essentials. However, this particular collection will give you almost all the, er, essential essentials. I question the omission of 'For Pete's Sake'and 'She,' but the wise move by Rhino to include the actual single versions of certain songs (for their first time on CD) attests that logical thought went into this collection.If you're just looking for the basic hits, this is a good way to go. I will say though that if you want to go a little deeper, the Anthology paints a bigger overall picture (and collects most of the missing essentials.)"
3,"DE review of ""The Monkees - Greatest Hits""","When Rhino Records issued this version of The Monkee's greatest hits, they did their diehard fans a disservice because the far superior Arista Records version ""That Was Then - This Is Now: The Best Of The Monkees"" from 1986, which is no longer in print, included 25 of their greatest hits, which included the new songs ""Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere"" and ""Kicks"" which were recorded specifically for this compilation by Mickey Dolenz and Peter Tork along with the hit ""That Was Then - This Is Now"" included on the Rhino release. ""Greatest Hits"" is a good start, but the Arista version from 1986 is a far superior collection of Monkee music, should you find a used copy somewhere. It does not however include the minor Monkees hit from 1987 from the ""Pool It"" release."
4,A great base for starting a Monkees collection,"This is a good CD to get if you want to find out whether you like the Monkees or not. The sound is fantasticly clear and the selection is of their most popular songs. However, it does include a song written by Micky and a few lesser-known titles. Also, the phamphlet inside the the jewel case gives an interesting and funny summary of the Monkees' lifespan. This is my first CD of theirs and I love it."
3,Almost But Not Quite,The songs are better than I remembered them but to call this a greatest hitsis stretching it a bit. Obviously the non hit filler songs were added becausethe record company is planning on subsequent volumes. Because of this Ican't rate it any higher. Great music bad business!
1,Disappointment,"I was really disappointed as I appreciate the Monkeys more as the years go by. Most songs clip out and skip, like an old scratched record.They should not be allowed to sell products of quality this poor."
3,There good,"I must admit my favirote group outsiede of Christian rock is the Beatles just cheack out Rubbersoul and the white album out. The monkeys had some good songs Im a Beliver and Daydream believer to name a few. There good, but to compare them to the Beatles music is silly. GodBless"
5,Great album!!,This was my first Monkees album. Now I have them all. This album is super. All of the songs on it are great. If you love the Monkees I suggest buying this album.
4,"GREAT, BUT IT'S MISSING SOMTHING","THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM, FOR MONKEES FANS, BUT I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE ADDED SOME SONGS(MAYBE TURN IT INTO A 2CD). I'D LIKE IT TO HAVE ""AUNIE GRAZELDA"", ""CUDDYLY TOY"",""YOU JUST MAY BE THE ONE"" AND MORE. STILL, BUY THIS VERY COOL CD"
3,Help! Looking for 2 Other Song Titles!,"There are 2 other Monkees songs that I like but haven't been able to find on a CD along with the favorites of mine: Theme for the Monkees, Last Train to Clarksville, I'm a Believer, Steppin Stone, Daydream Believer, That Was Then, This is Now and Words. The songs I am looking for, are: Cheer Up Sleepy Jean and Girl. Does anyone know where I can find a CD with at least all of the songs on it?Appreciate any help, in advance!Thank you!"
3,Review of the Monkees Greatest hits CD,"I was disappointed in this CD. I know there are more HITS than what is on this CD. This CD only has a few hits and then there are songs I either; never heard before or I don't remember them. Word to the wise, check out the individual songs on this CD b4 you purchase it. I didn't, and I'm sorry about that."
4,A good CD for starters,"This CD contains all of the hits, and some of the singles that weren't added onto the reissued albums as extras. Unfortunately, The Monkees had too many good songs to fit onto one CD. This CD is especially good for new Monkees fans that want to hear the hits. It's also good for the casual listener that just wants the hit songs. However, one CD can't show you how diverse and wonderful The Monkees songs really were. This is a great CD for any fans on 60's pop music, and if you enjoy this, you should look into getting other Monkees CD's."
4,Monkeyshines--sort of,"Anyone who has a modicum of interest in The Monkees should consider buying this album. There are a number of really good tracks on this disc including ""Goin' Down"", ""Randy Scouse Git"", ""Words"" and ""Listen to the Band"" to name just a few.Unfortunately, there are also a few duds on here that keep this disc from being a first-rate compilation. Rhino would've done well to omit ""D.W. Washburn"" and ""Porpoise Song"" as these songs signal the beginning of the end for The Monkees and are otherwise forgettable pieces. Ditto for ""That Was Then, This Is Now."" Instead, Rhino should've included lesser known but far better material like ""Teardrop City"" or ""Man Without A Dream"".Despite these minor weaknesses, this is album is definitely worth adding to your collection."
5,monkees rule,never get tired of their songs...still dance and sing along to them...this is great!!! can go back to my teen years any time i want!!!
4,great grandma,It is a good cd. It does have the greatest hits from the early years to the later times I would recommend it
4,Must Have,"If you like Rock n Roll, you will like this disc. The Monkees, the studio made band powered by great songwriters give you hit after hit on this disc. At one point the Monkees were nearly as big as the Beatles, and if you listen to this disc you will hear why. Its a great disc to have in your collection and it has many songs worth jamming out to such as, Pleasant Valley Sunday, I'm a believer, and Stepping Stone. These songs were anthems in the 60's for pop, and really helped define what pop music is today. This album is worth having."
5,Very great addition to a car-guy's garage,"This is a very great tool to use. Its simple to set up and the only thing I think you need to worry about if you use the metal bristles is how MUCH stuff you want to strip off. It will handle several layers of paint and rust in one whack, but it really does take a powerful compressor to keep it going at the right speeds. The Home Depot specials or in my case a hand-me-down from my dad was under-powered for the job.Great tool though!"
1,Hmm...,"I haven't been able to get it to work with the Clie TJ27, although the box clearly indicates that it works with the T series. The installation software loads just fine, and the keyboard icon appears on the launcher, as stated in the instruction booklet. I can even change the keyboard settings (there aren't many - On/Off - Fast/Slow). But that's it. As far as the keyboard goes.... I pressed the keys until my fingerprints began to wear off, and still nothing!On the plus side, the photo in the ad isn't a very good representation of this item. It looks much better in person; it's actually a cute piece of equipment. Fits in a shirt pocket, and it comes with a folding stand that holds the PDA in much the same way that a cradle might. Unfortunately, since it doesn't seem to work for me, there isn't much to offer here in terms of recommendations."
1,What no 0 stars?,I doesn't work. Some monkey engineered it. Why would they sell it if it doesn't work? The shipping coast more then keyboard and that's not refundable. Feels like a scam to me. It was just a complete waist of time.
4,Adequate for short undergraduate course,"I used this book to instruct a 16-week junior/senior level course in Electromagnetics for Electrical Engineers. The book starts with the fundamentals of electric charge, potential, current, and Coulomb's law. The middle portion of the book is devoted to Maxwell's equations and magnetic fields. The final chapters feature antennas and wave propagation.Strong Points: Undergraduate students will benefit from the large number of solved examples throughout the text. Answers are provided for even-numbered end-of-chapter problems. The companion CD contains further exercises and problem solutions. The layout of the book and text type make for easy reading. All important formulas and equations are clearly labeled.To summarize: the book tends towards the ""cookbook"" variety and contains enough material for a short course without going into more depth such as J. Kraus's book on Electromagnetics."
2,Not quite what I expected,"Paperback book with what appear to be black & white pages from a copy machine.Also, payed extra for 1-day delivery through Amazon Prime and received the book 2.5 days later(1 day later than I needed it.)"
1,Bootleg Bootleg Bootleg Bootleg Bootleg,"This book has the right ISBN number but it's a photocopy textbook. It's fake; it does not come with the CD. I just lost 100 and something dollars. Pages are photocopies, and falling off. And I bought this directly from Amazon, not from any seller. It's a ripoff. I don't know who is supplying Amazon this. If it's the publisher, they need to reduce the price because it's not worth 100 and something or improve the quality."
1,Bootleg??,"This paperback version of the textbook had the right ISBN number, but is NOT what my class used (not exactly). Firstly, there was no CD or DVD with the solutions worked out on it like the book says it has. Secondly, all these pages were low quality xerox copy, black and white reproductions of the real textbook. All the graphics were washed out, like when you make a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy on an old xerox machine. Many random pages were loose, which I didn't find until I got to that page in the middle of the book. All in all, this is what I would expect to see if they had counterfeit textbooks. Oh, and the textbook itself was VERY poorly written; even if I had bought a regular quality printing, all the English was so awkwardly written that I spent most of my time trying to figure out what the guy was trying to write instead of working problems. Only use this book if your class has homework out of it; otherwise go with another, more literate writer."
2,A one-sided view of a great general,"I have to admit I read this book with great expectations. I thoroughly enjoy reading about ancient history. I was to be greatly disappointed. The only reason I give this book a ""3"" rating is because of the interesting commentary on the terrain Mr. Wood & co. went over to retrace Alexander's steps and the wonderful photographs. The author seems to have a decidedly ""Persian"" or ""non-Greek"" view. He accepts without hesitation the views of the indigenous peoples from the regions Alexander conquered and any greek accounts of Alexander that are negative, while being 'a priori' suspicious of any pro-Alexander view given. Mr. Wood calls these first-hand reports propaganda, dismissing them outright. I would recommend anyone wanting a balanced view of the great general Alexander to read ""Alexander the Great and His Time"" by Agnes Savill. I would also suggest that Mr. Wood read it as well."
4,Alexander: a military genius and a weak cruel human being.,"I enjoyed Michael Wood's documentary for being in-depth, hands-on and on-site work on history. Wood did a fine job of presenting Alexander the Great as a military genius, a daring risk taker and a war hero. Which seems to describe the greatness of Alexander. He showed us Alexander the human being who was no human at all based on supporting Greek sources. He killed his own half-brother and stepmother as well as many of his own closest allies. Wood presented Alexander as the Dhul Qaranein (the two-horned) mentioned in Quran, the Muslim holy book. This is proven to be wrong. Dhul Qaranein is Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Persian Empire. It is hard to believe Wood went to Persepolis and Passaragadae and did not notice the two-horned relief of Cyrus the Great. There are several credible sources proving Cyrus was the Dhul Qaranein.Jamshid Varza"
4,A round of applause for Wood,"I am 13 and in the seventh grade. Because I love history, I picked up this book and was captivated instantly. In spite of the negative reviews, I ventured to read it myself and it was well worth it. If you love history, Greek or Macedonian, this book is a must read."
1,"Poor, atrocious way to do business","Box arrived from publisher, ""Empty"".Very poor, deplorable customer no-service.Took several weeks for any type of response.Finally involved an attorney to get their attention and subsequent refund.Would never buy from again.Was to be a birthday present, then delay slippage to Xmas gift, then to an empty box, and finally to nothing!Shameful business practice."
3,Notre Dame Fighting Irish 22x17 Desk Calendar 2007,"It was damaged when I received it. It was supposed to be a Christmas present for my Boss. I tried to glue it where it came apart but it didn't work out that well, I was disappointed."
3,A little disappointed,This product arrived after Christmas (was ordered Dec 5) and had apparently been slightly folded at one point because it did not lay flat and had a slight crease down the front. I believe that it occured while in the mail because the box was also mildly bent. It was a great gift idea and appreciated by the reciever but I was a bit dissappointed over all. I ordered a calendar last year (a different team logo from a different distributer) and was happier with that transaction.
1,Absolutely terrible,"This game might not be so bad if it wasn't so hard to find your way around. The camera is terrible and always finds a bad place to settle to. The dungeons are very repetitive and dull. In fact, it is impossible to tell one part of a dungeon from another or how far you have left to go in any of them. And very often, after one of the countless dungeon battles, you will be unable to tell which way you were going beforehand. So you'll end up spending an hour walking back to the entrance, only to have to turn around and go back the right way. As one of the Nintendo Power reviewers said about this game:""It's more like a trip to the dentist than a quest."""
3,Color all wrong,"Excellent quality as one expects from a USA company like Allen. The color is way different from the picture. Grey and dull,not bright colors, and not what was expected. 2 star loss for poor photo and description."
4,handy to have,Quick to use and easy to throw away. I am sure we will purchase these again the next time we need small paint brushes.
5,Rockin My Monkey Socks,"The Barenaked Ladies keep up a tradtion of quality songs with a meaning. It may just be a stuipd and hysterical song like ""Another Postcard"", or something subtelly depressing as I found ""Celebrity"".Many groups loose skill and quality as they grow larger and have been arong longer, but BnL will be one of the few who don't.This cd rocks my monkey socks.Too freaking bad they never have a show near Philadelphia."
2,"When your 8-year-old thinks it's dumb, you've got a problem","The Barenaked Ladies needed some pocket money for Christmas, so they assembled this mess of unmemorable material. Their ""intelligent but lite"" style has given way to just plain silliness, with endless repetitions of mildly catchy choruses that compel you to slap the ""next"" button on the CD player. All the songs are ringers for better-crafted tunes on prior albums, but most miss their mark and come out as pale imitations. My 8-year-old found these songs annoying and dumb and hates this record -- and who can argue with that."
5,"Don't let the catchy single ""Another Postcard"" fool you...","With Everything 2 Everyone, Barenaked Ladies have finally come into their own. Listening to this newest release, one can't help but be marveled by the lyrical and musical genuis of it. You're listening to a band that has matured lyrically and musically. They are completely comfortable together, and it shows. The stuff on this album is fresh, honest and sometimes painfully raw. Make no mistake, this is their absolute best stuff yet. If you haven't had a chance to catch their Peep Show pre-tour, please do...you won't be disappointed. :)"
4,Kicks Maroon's shiny metal mixing bowl,"Dude, Everything to Everyone is as great as Stunt!I personally am not a fan of Maroon and, after seeing the ""Another Postcard"" video, expected very little from this album (despite the cuteness of the chimps), but I could not have been more surprised. Though the first track (""Celebrity"") didn't impress me at all, ""Another Postcard"" really grew on me after I heard the surrounding material -- ""Maybe Katie"" is the catchiest song I've heard in a while, and ""Next Time"" is great too. From there on the whole album is spectacular. I adore the straightforwardness in ""Testing 1,2,3"" (a song They Might Be Giants could write if they weren't singing in character so often), and the darkness of ""War On Drugs"". Actually I could name a -ness I like about every song on here but I'll shut up at this point and conclude with a good ol' ""buy this album"". So, bye! (this album)"
5,CD RULES,"As i noticed reading the other reviews, peope have gave this album a bad review then if so, BNL have successfully did what they wanted to do they wanted to make an album different then the ohter ones they have made. i personally like maby katie, another postcard, shopping, and have you seen my love, overall this album is all over good. but i do agree with some people that celebrity is not a good opener maby a good finishing touch or one of the last songs but not an opener. the special edition dvd version is cool with the extra track yes, yes, yes. i recomend this to any one who likes alt. rock, pop rock, or BNL"
4,Catchy Melodies,"Its amazing how many people are so hard on the Barenaked Ladies. This fine Canadian band consistently puts out fine recordings without making their fans wait terribly long for new material.The melodies from this fine band are very ear friendly with sophisticated pop stylings. Next Time to my ears is the best tune on this collection with its fine instrumental arrangements, super harmony vocals, and strong song structure. Shopping is another cute tune making fun of materialistic people. Second Best is a good driving rocker and Testing 1,2,3 has some noteworthy harmonies and lyrics.Some of the musical arrangements are less varied than on Stunt and even Maroon. Also some of the songs are a little similar to recordings on these aforementioned CD's. Nonetheless that is not such a bad thing as these two CD's were very good recordings. A little more growth would be nice. However, this is very good music with a nice touch of humor."
4,not bad,"Look, this is a good album...one of their best? not at all. While some of the songs show some of their best work there are some songs that just dont cut it. In a way, I feel you have to be a long time fan to really enjoy this album. For example the song shopping. To the casual listener this is a horrible song. For me though, this is classic BNL. Random and funny. Same thing happens with Take it Outside. This song is better ""music"" than shopping but still a stupid song, but to me I think its great, ""Who'd want to get their lights knocked out"" The rest of this album is fairly solid, celebrity is great, maybe katie complements celebrity well. Testing 1,2,3 is my favorite. My advice, if you are a bnl fan get this, it is good..if u aren't a long time fan get a different album to get your first impression. Recomended = stunt, maroon, gordon."
5,"It's NOT ""Second Best""...it's EVEN BETTER!","If you didn't like it the first time...keep listening, it grows on you to become a solid, thought-provoking, rockin' album with a great variety of musical styles and fantastic subliminal political commentary. If you still don't like it...see them perform the stuff live. It is INCREDIBLE! They really hit the bullseye on this one and they sound amazing singing and performing it live. The harmonies are tight and the intricate musical gems are breathtaking. With great musical and lyrical depth and variety this proves that BNL has grown more brilliant, creative, introspective and lovable with time."
5,Just my opinion...,"I was just looking at the reviews of this album after I rushed out and got a hold of it the day it was released. I love the album...some fun songs and some with more depth. I just wanted to add this post because I saw a review commenting about the streamlining of the sound and I have to say that I had a completely different reaction to this CD. My first thought was...wow, each song has an entirely different feel from the last. So I just wanted to offer another view. I have been a BNL fan for a while and I was not dissapointed with Everything to Everyone!"
2,Bare Naked Pop,"As a peripheral BNL fan, I have always admired the off beat sense of humor these guys dish out. With previous releases, I have been able to discover new things in repeated listenings. This cd got stale fast. Seems to be geared to the tween crowd. I am hopeful newer releases will stay true to the BNL I have enjoyed in years past."
2,what happened??,"I have been a BNL fan since Stunt, and I have to say this CD is a major letdown. Maroon was great, and after waiting for years for this new CD I had high hopes. I love BNL, but this new album is a Disappointment (notice the capital ""D""?). Maybe the next CD will be better...till then, we can always listen to the old albums."
3,barenaked ripoff,"In a day and age where most bands are including a free DVD to encourage people to purchase their music from retailers and not download their songs from file swapping services, leave it to the guys in BNL to charge one price for just the CD and another inflated price for the CD plus the DVD, which they are calling the ""Special Edition."" Trust me. The actual cost of putting the DVD in at the same price of just the CD is minimal (were probably talking fractions of a penny here) and everyone from the band, to the record label to the retailers would still have plenty of money to line their pockets. The password, ladies, and gents, is greed."
1,BNL Jumps the Shark?,"Their pattern seems to be that they put out a great album every other time. Maroon was incredible, and came at you right from the jump with ""Too Little..."" the same way they opened their shows. That album had great energy, great songwriting, great musicianship. This album is like cream of wheat or my ex-wife: it just kind of lays there. What is it about trying to do a follow-up to a great album? Guster's latest sucks, this sucks, I'm not hopeful about the next Ben Folds since his last was so incredible. Sigh. I'll just go back to listening to my Little Feat box set..."
2,Ho Hum,A very dissappointing effort. This collection of songs seems very commercial to me. I doubt I will give this CD much play.
4,I liked this CD!!,"Well, I am a bit of a BNL fan. My first album that I got was ""Gordon"" back in the 90's....I also have ""Stunt"" and ""Greatest Hits"". I happened to buy this album from an online auction thinking I'd give it to a friend when I visit her next month...I even told her I'd got it for her. But after a few listens I am really hooked on this album and will now have to buy another copy so we can have one each!!"
3,"Not the best, but it grows on you...","I originally came to bury this album, not to praise it. Upon first listening to it, my disgust was unbounded. Could this pathetic dreck be from the same band that produced ""Maroon"" and ""Stunt"", two desert-island albums of which pretty much every song is great? However, with additional listening, it kind of grows on you. It's not up to the standards of their best albums, and it contains several embarrassing tracks, like the stupid, trying-too-hard-to-be-whimsical ""Another Postcard"", but it's got some pretty good ones too, i.e. ""War on Drugs"", ""Maybe Katie"", ""Have You Seen My Love?"" All in all, it's a good, fun album in the BNL tradition."
4,Keeps getting better after every play!,"I have a thing with bands I come to love. See they make the classic cd, of which they can never match, then they follow it up with dissapointing recordings showing the slightest reminder of the genius they were.I purchase every Barenaked Ladies cd with the reminder of their classic ""Gordon"" in the back of my head. I always wait for that new ""If I Had $100000"" or ""What a Good Boy"". With each release since Gordon I've needed time to appreciate them but ""Everything to Everyone"" is an exception. Their blend of fun nonsense ala ""Be My Yoko Ono"" is found here in tracks like ""Another Postcard"". Witty and insightful at the same time BNL strikes a chord with me yet again. Just listen to the words of ""Take it Outside"" and you are reminded of the wonderful (and unappreciated) depth of this band, able to make you think and chuckle within moments.Favorite songs so far: ""Celebrity"", ""Maybe Katie"", ""Take it Outside"", ""Another Postcard"", ""Testing 1,2,3"" and ""Shopping""."
4,Underrated release from underappreciated band,"A mellow, somewhat low key release by BNL with plenty of gems.That's the brief run down on the disc. To be more specific, while it's no ""Gordon"" (BNL's masterpiece a la Fleetwood Mac's ""Rumours"" or Michael Jacksons' ""Thriller"" for example) if you buy it realizing that fact you'll find an enjoyable experience. ""Another Postcard"" is one of the oddest hits (but it just burrows its weirdness into your head and stays put). ""Maybe Katie"" is a prime BNL single candidate. I like BNL when they illuminate a real life find of experience or mentality (""When I Fall"" is a great example from Pirate Ship) and in this case they do so very well with ""Take It Outside"", one of the best cuts.The lukewarm response to this record is unfortunate since the band always releases thoughtful, enjoyable pop. In a fair world some of the pop shlock that rises to the top would be gone and room would be made for better, consistent bands like BNL."
4,"Really, really, catchy; really, really good.","This is an album that has to grow on you. It had to grow on me, and I needed to listen to it a few times to appreciate it. My personal favorites are ""For You"" and ""Upside Down,"" though every track is pretty good. ""Shopping"" had a slightly too subtle joke. It's true that in the second half, the album oses a little quality, but the really good tunes in the first half more than make up for that. There's something for everyone here--except those who will not, under any circumstances, listen to pop music of any kind, regardless of quality."
3,"Some good, some bad, some indifferent","BNL is continuing to show the influence of other bands in this album, particularly The Cars and The Beatles. While this is jarring, they do a good job of incorporating the sound into their style. Some flat spots on this album, most notably Another Postcard. It seems a transparent ploy to get another hit single using Ed's rap abilities a-la One Week. Unfortunately, the subject matter is so vapid that it diminishes the quality of the song. There are some very good tracks here, including Maybe Katie, Next Time, War On Drugs, and Take It Outside."
3,"Some good moments, mostly blah!","I have listened to nearly everything Barenaked Ladies have ever put out and I have found this album to be somewhat of a disappointment. The opening track ""Celebrity"" is a sleepfest. The single ""Another Postcard"" is just too novel. I have no problem with odes to chimpanzees or ""Shopping,"" but the cleverness of BNL lyrics seems to be missing. The strongest track, in my opinion, is ""War on Drugs"" followed closely by ""Maybe, Katie."" It's typical of their slower, more dark stuff which Steven really shines on. Other tracks of promise are ""Upside Down,"" ""For You"" and ""Take it Outside"" As with most recent BNL work, it may require a couple listens. I grew to love ""Maroon,"" thinking it was one part pop, one part dark, and two parts clever. Here's hoping the same happens with ""Everything to Everyone."""
2,Not too good,"I bought this CD for my husband who is a BNL fan. When I asked him how he liked his gift, he told me I would have to listen to it for myself. While, some of the songs on this CD are catchy,I can't describe any of them as enjoyable. The music sounded cheap, the words mudane and boring. I feel like the whole album was a project in being cute and clever, which is no crime. However, I felt that the true quality of past BNL albums was compromised in an effort to be too cute and their trademark cleverness just ended up being silly. So, unless you are a diehard fan, I wouldn't recommend this CD."
1,A big let down,"Despite initial disapointment I forced myself to give this album repeated listens in the hope that it would gradually grow in my estimations to something approaching the high regard that I hold the rest of the BNL catalogue in. Sadly the more I heard it the less I liked it. Only ""Aluminium"" comes close to anything that they've released in the past and if ""War on Drugs"" didn't grab you the first time then repeated listens only make it more embarassing. Taken as a whole it sounds like a band trying to recapture a formula that worked so well in the past but lacking the creative energy to pull it off. Hopefully E2E serves as a signal that a rethink is underway in the band's camp and future releases will be up to the standard they set with their debut and rarely dropped away from.Still, at least it's better than the unspeakable Christmas effort that followed."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I didn't think it was possible, but they did it: the Barenaked Ladies actually made a sub-par album. This record is just weak. Don't get me wrong, there's some great songs here [""Celebrity"", ""War On Drugs"", ""Aluminum""], but most of it [particularly ""Another Postcard"" and 'Shopping""] is just embarrasing. I've always enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek side of BNL, but the jokes on this album are far too blatant. Rather than finding the perfect balance, BNL put too much emphasis on humor and too little on songwriting, and the songwriting is where they really shine. I tried to like this album, I really did, but it just didn't happen. I'm still spinning the first five albums non-stop; they are classics."
3,Not the greatest BNL album,"I've been a BNL afficionada for quite some time now, and I have loved all of their productions for their unique flavor and at times hilariously absurd lyrics. I had also highly anticipated the release of this album. But honestly, it was a letdown compared to 'Stunt,' and 'Maroon,' my two favorite BNL albums.What went wrong? Could it be when they decided to sing about chimpanzees writing letters? 'Everything to Everyone' just doesn't hit the same chords as previous albums. The lyrics are over-the-top off-the-wall, and the tunes seem to go well with that theme. But it is a fun album, nonetheless. Three stars for the sheer Star Force/Name, and minus two for the unnecessary wackiness..."
3,It was OK,"The entire DVD was entertaining. Don't get me wrong-it wasn't exciting, but it was entertaining. Most of what they say is ""Don't get distracted"" and ""Don't drink/use drugs and drive"". I personally wouldn't spend $8 dollars for it,because I only think it's worth about $2."
1,Don't be a sucker like me,"Bull, and nothing but bull.Out of the 30 minutes of playing time, about 20 are spent on irrelevant small talk; the rest covers basic advice that is readily available in any driver's manual available for free at your local DMV office.When I purchased the disk I figured that since it was compiled by ""Driving Professionals"" that it would provide driving insights such as accident avoidance maneuvers and other techniques. I don't need to pay $15 for someone to tell my kids not to drink and drive or not to use cellphones while driving. All that I can tell them myself (and have told them repeatedly), for free!Adding insult to injury, the footage is poorly produced, most of it looks like made with a budget home video camera.Don't make rich people richer, don't let these chiselers get your money for nothing. Above all, don't get your kids bored and pis...d at you for making them watch this nonsense, it may prove to be extremely counter productive."
1,save your money!,Dont buy this dvd because it is to short and telling you stuff that everybody knows.Save your money mr or misses.
5,Absolutely first rate,"As teen driving DVDs go, I've seen most of them. And most of them lack substance. This one is head and shoulders above the rest. Used as suggested by the publishers, it may save your child's life one day. There is now an updated version of it called ""The Driving Zone 2"".Andy Pilgrim does a wonderful job of presenting the real world of driving to the teen in your family. Watch this video with him or her, and you will learn something as well. And look up the Andy Pilgrim Foundation devoted to this cause. It's the best there is."
3,Good for a joke present,"I bought this book as a crazy joke present for someone. Unless you plan to do the same, give it a miss. It will not teach you how to talk to your cat despite the (I suspect somewhat deranged) author's best intentions. The really weird part is that she actually believes in what she is writing."
1,ridiculous!!,This is the most ridiculous and asinine book I have ever seen!! It would be laughable except that I feel the author has a real mental illness. It is an absolute shame.
1,Worst cat book ever,"You've probably seen a cute email from a friend or co-worker describing different cat meows and what they might mean. Now imagine try to read 200 pages of this garbage with words like ""mrrroowwe"" and equally stupid pronounciation guide. I wonder how many idiots have taken this authors advice and are meowing back at their animals. For me the joke wore thin in less than 5 minutes.Folks, you want to communicate with animals, then go send a donation to your local Humane Society chapter or zoo."
2,PLANE CAME DAMAGE,"THE PLANE CAME A LITTLE DAMAGE, THE BOTTOM OF THE PLANE WAS HIT WITH SOMETHING, THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WHAS NOT GLUED"
1,"Worked with ME, not XP","I used to use this software a good bit when I had WinME. The only real problem I had was with the answering machine. NO matter what I did, the recorded voice (mine, not the pre-recorded included) sounded as if it was speaking at half-speed.I've now upgraded to WinXP and I can't get it to work. It installs fine, recognizes and initiates my modem, but it won't send out a fax, nor will it let me make any settings changes. It acts as if there is no phone line connected.Also, good luck finding any support whatsoever. The original maker Communique, doesn't even list this product on their website.Stay far, far away!"
1,Do Not Buy This Software,"I also purchased this software because it was a good price and it seemed to have all of the features I was looking for. However, when I installed in on my computer to use it, it never worked. I am now out the money I paid for the software because you can not return opened software. I believe if the software requires special equiptment it should be listed on the box so that other comsumers don't waste their money on something that won't work with thier hardware. DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE."
2,Communicate! 10,I was very disappointed with this software. However it may be the fault is with my modem although a lite version and trial version came with the modem.The voicemail part of the product doesn't work. answer messages cut off before they are complete and the line is disconnected after three or four seconds of starting to leave an answer. In addition the purchased version only gives garbled answering messages.However faxing works perfectly well receive and send. Modem and software technical help have not been able to identify the problem. I am operating with MS Vista Ultimate.
2,Have not yet got it to work on VOIP,"Looks like this program might be good for a land line phone, but have not figured out how to use it on an internet based phone service like Vontage or Skype."
4,Great bandolier!,"For the price, this thing is great! The elastic is a little tight and it takes some strength to get the shells in, but overal a great belt."
4,What I Expected,"I ordered this belt for two reasons, to hold 12 gauge shells and to serve as a belt for the ""UTG Adjustable Leg Holster for Pistol, Black.""The belt material is a cheap canvas which i was expecting but it gets the job done.The loops for the shells are extremely tight but you can definitely fit in a 12 gauge shell. I would rather have them tight then loose where they can fall out. Over time I'm sure they will loosen up a little. Its actually convenient right now since I can hold 5.56 rounds as well since its so tight.The top loop of UTG Leg Holster wraps around the belt perfectly and securely. Overall a great buy for the price."
1,Better have a sharp knife,"You would think that something this simple would be without difficulties. Not so. I bought two and both required major modifications to the buckle before I could even get them open. If you have another choice, take it."
5,As advertised,"Belt is extremely adjustable for anyone of a size and shape I can imagine. Holds shells securely, even a little tight loading 20ga the first time, but I'm sure that will get easier with use. Liked it so much I ordered another for 12ga."
4,shell belt,"Surprisingly small when it comes to you.. but no joke this could fit around any man. belt comes with a lot of slack but that is a simple fix.Another thing when the belt comes it comes brand new okay, meaning it will take a little time to fit the slugs in the hole but as soon as you do it breaks in very fast.all and all this is an excellent product for a great price. fits 25 shells and leaves room to loop a mag holster or two onto as well."
5,does what it's made for,The shells fit in tight but the elastic stretches a bit so that is a good thing. I find it is still easy to get them out of the loops. does what it's meant to do. Like it.
4,Shell Belt Holder,Belt was as described.I have not had a chance to use it in the field yet but for all I can tell it will perform as I want it to. Friends have seen it and are going to order one like it. Thanks
4,Keep pliers handy,It was very hard to load shells the first time. Hopefully. this will be easier to load as the material stretches.
4,Nice,I like how this works. I have had a lot of issue with these kind of belts in the past so we will see. Feels good and can be used over the shoulders.
5,good belt,im a bigger guy and it fits perfectly and still has like a foot of extra belt. its nice solid construction and holds shells tightly. i would recomend this to any one that takes their shotgun out hunting or just shooting for fun
4,"great price, great product",For the price I was not really holding out too much hope that this product would work and was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. Really I should have know better as have other Allen stuff and its all been pretty good. I use mine for 3 gun matches and ended up getting a couple more for people I shoot with. Nice Product.
2,Not great for 12 guage shells,"The price was right, but it is a battle getting 12 gauge shells in the belt. Not good for 12 gauge"
5,As soon as the world ends I'll let you know about these,"But for now I'll say these babies hold shells like a new mother... Firm and tight, but with care! I wish I could wear these around my waist to church... Wait Michigan is an open carry state I can! Party On Babayy!"
5,Sweet!!,"This is everything I was hoping for. It is sturdy and was absolutely easy to insert all 25 shells. I did find the easiest way to do it was insert every other slot and then go back and do the rest. The shells are held tight as a bug and no ammount of shaking seems to make them want to slide out. This is a guilty pleasure purchase for sure. I plan to use this as a bandolier not as an actual belt. I have tac holsters on my waist so no room for it to be used that way. Now I am ready for the zombie apocolypse, or the occupy people. LOL"
4,Allen Shotgun Shell Belt,"I really like this belt. I purchased it to hold 410 shells and they fit beautifully. In also holds 20 gauge shell nicely as well. I havent used it yet on 12 gauge, however I think they would be a very tight fit. The belt is long, but can be ajusted to fit most any waste, however there is an excess of webbing strap that hangs when worn aroung the waste. This may be so you can use it as a bandolier as well. The side release webbing clip is of good quality and very large. This piece alone is worth a few bucks seperately. I would have given this item a 5 if they had included a buckle to tie up the excess webbing."
3,Allen 25 rd. shotgun bandolier shel belt,"For 5.00 shipped, you cant go wrong...although Allen is a product normally made in the USA, sadly it was made in CHINA (BOOOO! G.D.Sellouts!) I would have paid double easily for it to be made here but oh well...sturdy clip, tight elastic...great for the money."
5,Very happy with this!,"When I first got this (earlier today), I thought there was no way 12 gauge shells would fit in it. Those loops were just way too small, like it was made for .410 or something. They do fit though, just quite snugly. I loaded up the belt with 25 shells and think it will loosen up a little with time. Those shells aren't going to be falling out, that is for certain.Some have questioned the plastic buckle. Normally I don't like plastic buckles, either. This is one big sturdy buckle, though! I trust it.I bought 2 of these belts, so I can clip them together bandolier-style if I wish. Actually, they're probably long enough to wear them both at once, western crossed-bandolier style.Uh... that's it. It's a belt. It holds shotgun shells. That's all it does, but it does it well."
4,good product !!!,"Good product !!! holds the shells really tight. Make me feel like rambo. Great price, convenient, does the job. No complaints here."
5,Great Buy for the Avid Hunter or Recreational Shooter,"I bought two of these so I could carry my 20 gauge and 12 gauge separately. The belts were tough and durable, even when it got caught on some tree branches, the threads never pulled. The buckle is sturdy and locks in smoothly with no struggle. I did, however, have a tough time getting the shells in at first. I had to 'pre-stretch' each loop with my finger and slide the shells in. After they were all in, they slid in and out with ease. Although, they never did fall out while walking through the woods which was nice. I would highly recommend this belt to anyone interested in shotgun sporting."
4,"good, not great","first of all, like other people have stated, this is way too big to be a belt unless you cut the slack off. Which I think I might do since wearing it as a bandoleer is a bit hard to balance. Maybe if I tighten it up a bit. I think the 50 round one is probably more balanced as you have weight front and back instead of just the front like this 25 round one. 12 gauge ammo are hard to get on but that makes me feel secured. For the price, plus free shipping from Prime? can't beat it"
5,Great deal,"This is a really affordable, simple, well-made shotgun shell holder. The shell loops are a tight fit at first, but it doesn't get too loose with repeated use. It's solidly built, and fits nearly any size body either as a bandolier (my preferred use) or a belt. Can't beat the price, either."
4,Great 12Ga Belt.,"Nice belt, material seems good, stitching seems ok, I will have to put it through some rough testing, but right now i'm happy, holds my 12Ga Shells nicely! Would recommend especially for the cheap price!"
3,Too Tight,"When I got it it was too tight to easily hold 12 ga. shells, but after alittle work they will slide in and out just fine, The thread has started to come undone between the holders now though and the description should have specified a size of shell."
3,Serves its purpose.,"As with everything else I've found in the world of shotguns, this 20/12 ga. accessory is better suited for a 20 gauge, but will work alright for a 12. Reason being, the loops for the shells are tight enough to be inconvenient on the larger 12 gauge shells.The buckle is strong and secure, and the belt works just fine, otherwise. I would rather pay a little more and have the choice between the two sizes, but this item would work okay for hunting, as there's not really a rush to reload. It's not a great tactical accessory."
1,Won't unbuckle and elastic is very tight for 12g shells.,First off the belt won't unbuckle which is the main reason for the low rating. Additional the elastic is very tight for 12g shells. I will be sending it back.
2,Not for 12 Guage,"I bought this to use with a UTG airsoft shotgun that uses cartridges that look like real 12 Guage shells. But the shells don't fit in this thing. Sure, I could probably maange to jam them in there but I'd be afraid that it'd damage the shells because it would be very very tight. Even if it didn't immediately cause damage I'd be concerned that leaving them in there for any length of time would warp the shells and cause problems. Oh well, at this price there's probably no point in returning it since the shipping would cost as much as the belt. :("
1,Do not buy,"This product seems like a great deal at the price. However, you get what you pay for. This belt is made in China and apparently they do not know the diameter of a 12 gauge shot shell. The loops can fit a .410 or 20 gauge at most.....and I bought 3 of them. Doh!"
2,never recived item,i never received my item and it has been 8 days since it was supposivley delievered. I would not purchase this if i do not get it squared away.
4,A decent CD Burner,"Compared to my first CD burner this is a tremendous upgrade. While I haven't cranked out dozens of cd's, I like it's speed and reliability. I had to send it in for repair 3 months after receiving it, apparently the laser was faulty. Yamaha's tech support was helpful and fairly prompt. The next problem came shortly after the repair when I wanted to compile an audio disk. My computer kept crashing. Everthing else about the CD burner seemed to work fine. Obviously there was some sort of software incompatability. Long story made short, load the software onto your C: drive, don't use a secondary drive. The problem isn't so much with Nero Burning ROM as it is with a Windows driver that gets confused. Now I have the software on the C: drive, but I configured the cache memory on my slave drive to take advantage of it's greater speed and volume. Throughout, tech support was helpful on the phone and through email. Kudos to ""Ron"" at Yamaha."
4,Its fine,I mean it has not recorded anything in three minutes(only 5) for me nor has the tatoo thing worked but its fast and it has potential. It seems flimsy(cheap plastic plate-they may vary tho) but I tell you Yamaha makes quality audio. It was packed with care and it has these neat lights that glow on the outside. Im still glad I have it. It is better than most burners out there and nero is good software when it does not freeze up my win2k os. What can I say. Its the name.
2,Lost Interest,I started reading this book and after a few chapters I put it away. I lost interest. So there is nothing more I can say about this book
1,Easily the worst thing I've ever read,This is easily the worst thing I've ever read. The plot is unimpressive and completely drowned out by the fact that the whole thing is jam packed with the sexual exploits of a 10 year old girl and her group of men and women who are all desperately in love with her. It was quite disturbing.
3,"Different take on vampires, but has a dissapointing ending",I am a die hard Butler fan and this book starts off wonderfully. Butler addresses issues like Race and gender in her usual intriging way. The problem that I have with this book is that it seemed to die at the end. It felt like Ms Butler was in a rush to complete the story so it left me feeling more than a bit unsatisfied. To sum it up The reader will like what they like about the book but they will definitely hate how it ends.
2,"Poorly Edited, Pedophilic Undertones","I love Octavia Butler. She was a brilliant, creative writer and I hold many of her works close to my heart. Her books seem to have a running theme of challenging social structure and societal norms, even around sexuality. That's part of what I appreciate about her writing. What I just can't tolerate is the pedophilic undertones of this book. I know the main character is technically in her fifties, but her body is that of a ten or eleven year old. I trudged through the otherwise entertaining story (skipping the love scenes, yuck!), but I'm still left disgusted by that theme, and wondering what Octavia Butler was thinking. Why was it important to her to carry her readers through scenes of grown men making love to a ten year old's body? Ugh! Gross gross gross... My only other complaint is that this book seemed to be very poorly edited. There were errors on at least every other page."
5,I wish someone could make a sequel,This was the first book I've read by Octavia Butler and it was amazing. I wish someone could legally buy the rights to the story and continue her work. It's a wonderful story that applies modern issues with fictional vampire sects. It really was an enjoyable read that I'd recommend everyone that enjoys sci-fi and vampires.
5,Octavia Butler's last novel,"I was so sorry to hear that Octavia Butler had died. If I were going to die young I would want to leave as good a book as ""Fledgling"" behind; all Butler's books are good, but ""Fledgling"" is also extremely funny. There are enough summaries of its plot to go on with already on Amazon, so you can read those.""Fledgling"" is less violent than most of Butler's other works, particularly ""The Parable of the Talents."" So if you don't like her because she grosses you out you might like this book. I like all her books, myself. It's so nice for the the literary angels in heaven that she is up there. I guess."
5,Butler continues to write to her strengths,"For the readers of Octavia E. Butler, it has been seven longs years since her last book. When I first read the synopsis for Fledgling, I was disappointed at the idea of a vampire story by Butler. I couldn't see her creating a character like Dracula, Lestat or Buffy. I should not have worried. Butler re-invents vampirism with considerable ingenuity and deftness. She does not tell a gothic tale but there is vibrant romance and eroticism. While there are truly horrific elements in the storyline, they are not based on tropes from the horror genre but familiar ones based on human nature.[...]"
5,A great read.,"This novel is both well written and enjoyable. I was sad to learn that there would not be any sequals, as Ms. Butler has passed on, but I gladly recommend this book to any one who loves vampire novels."
5,"Thoughtful, hypnotic novel about race, relationships...",Yes... its about vampires but it's not a sensational blood lust kind of book.Vampires... Octavia Butler style...She weaves a novel that you can't put down and also makes you think about the world and it's social prejudices that can be so ingrained...A rare find! Intelligent fantasy....
5,Excellent Fantasy,"I wanted to be part of the community. While the author's opinion of racial intolerance was apparent, it was thoughtfully rendered in a totally believable setting."
5,I first read this book at the library last March,"I bought this book for my library, I haven't read it again yet. I want to keep the newness as long as possible"
5,Great Book!,"Came across Octavia Butler by accident. Read a number of reader reviews of her writings before deciding to go with this book. Needless to say, this book is GREAT. Held me prisoner from 1st page. Awesome writing."
4,Fledgling by Octavia Butler,"Imagine waking up in a cave, alone, injured, and not knowing how you got there. That is how we are introduced to Shori, the main character in Octavia Butler's Fledgling. On the outside, Shori appears to be a young preteen girl. In actuality, she is a 53 year old Ina vampire. Shori journeys outside of the cave to find a community that has been burned to the ground. She's assumes that this community was once her home. Lost and hungry, Shori begins walking away from the rubble, down a lonely highway. The stranger that picks her up is oblivious to the change that both of their lives are about to undergo. I really enjoyed this novel as it is not your average vampire novel. It touched on all kinds of issues that I wouldn't think of associating with vampires such as racism, grief, and polygamy. Its hard for me to fit it into any one genre. I would say it has elements of mystery, paranormal romance, and even a little history."
4,Left wanting more,"a very interesting twist on the vampire genre, quite unique in many respects. not quite as well developed as some of her sci-fi tales. this was clearly intended to be the first of yet another trilogy by Butler, cut short by her death, so reading it is a bit like falling in love with a TV series that was suddenly cancelled at the end of the first season. as a result, very little is resolved and you are left wanting more, much more. still well worth reading."
2,Disturbing...,"After reading Kindred, I was looking forward to another novel by Ms. Butler . I was intrigued by the idea of a new race of vampire, but was unable to finish this story. Shori, the main character, is a 53 year old vampire in a 10 year olds body . She was badly injured and as a result has amnesia (and we are constantly reminded of this every other page ), over and over. It would have been helpful if Shori had been a likable character, but as many reviewers mentioned, she seems a little cold. I could not relate to her or any of the other characters . The sexual relations Shori had with adults was very disturbing , Perhaps it would've been better if she had appeared older and not like a 10 year old, having sex with men (and women) . The premise of Fledging ( a race of vampires able to bear sunlight ) is good, original, but unfortunately, this fell flat in so many ways ."
2,No bite,"I love Octavia Butler, but this book did not live up to her talent. I found the story to be boring, and the sexual scenes with a character who physically resembles a young prepubescent girl very disturbing. I stuck it out to the end with the hopes that the story would improve, but no such luck."
2,"Poorly written, not much substance","I had to read this book for English class, and I have to say, out of the dozen or so books we read this semester, this one was the worst. Outside of class, I read a lot, and I happen to be a fan of vampire fiction. Out of the many vampire novels I have read, I think this is actually one of the worst. Butler's writing is almost as poor as Stephanie Meyer's, but her plot is not nearly half as entertaining. Her prose has been called ""lean;"" I would call it simple to the point of childish. Another problem is that the characters are unconvincing. The main character's relationships seemed forced and unbelievable; her romances felt lifeless. Look elsewhere for good vampire fiction!"
3,A Creepy Story,"I didn't particularly like this novel. It wasn't badly written but it happened to touch on a theme that I thought was very creepy and I found my gut turning in at several different points in the novel. This might be a benefit to some readers but it's the reason why I have given up some authors altogether even though I like their writing style like Anne Rice when I read The Witching Hour. The Witching Hour had excellent language, and I could see everything in my head like it was a movie. The problem was everything I read in it was too creepy. Fortunately,I haven't had this problem with Octavia Butler in the past.I do like the plot because I found it really unique to the vampire genre and I like how one of my favorite authors came up with it. But it's a book I could only read once because of some of the things the main character did."
4,A different very original viewpoint,"This is a ""no spoiler"" review. Since reading Lilith's Brood by Octavia Butler, I have sought out her other books. I saved this for last because ""vampire"" fiction other than Lestat by Anne Rice has never appealed to me.This book has a very original viewpoint and is not typical and does not deliver what is expected. The themes that the author explores in her other work show up here and once again shows us that things are not always as they appear. She provides a good backstory to the story thus we get the ""whys"" and ""hows"" behind the characters.I recommend this book."
5,Loved it,"I've enjoyed Octavia Butler since it was an employee pick at a small book store in Newburyport MA in early 2002. I've read all her books and ejoyed them. I did purchase The Fledgling again for my son to read. We share a lot of the same interests. He did not, however, like this book. He thought it was teenager like and did not enjoy her writing style. I thought it was great and will read it again."
1,THIS is a game?,"The game would be fun if it actually PLAYED. Character voices got scrambled, abilities got scrambled, and NONE of the NPC's in this expansion actually came up with a dialogue box, making it IMPOSSIBLE to go on any of the additional adventures. They remained stuck in a loop, restating their default audio again and again and again.... This CD is NOT a game - it's a DRINK COASTER. DO NOT EVEN THINK about buying this pile until they release a bug fix!! I'm using a G4 running OS9.1 with 384Meg of ram, so I *think* I meet the min. requirements. Zero stars is more like it! Too many bugs to even consider - I RETURNED this stinker!"
4,Essential Reading,"Yes, essential for all the faithful who are frustrated and anguished at the sight of Holy Mother Church secularized, desacralized, and weakened, while the forces of barbarism gain strength through an ever-increasing number of adherents. Bear in mind that Father Miceli wrote ""The Antichrist"" 20 years ago; the world is far more awash in sewage today than it was in 1981.To be sure, Father Miceli can get carried away on occasion, and his condemnation of Communism was more appropriate two decades ago than it is currently. Nevertheless, he makes a powerful case, and one that is at least as fresh and relevant today as it was 20 years ago.This book can be found. Find it."
4,The Antichrist,"Owned book previously but lost it. Wanted to read again and ordered, delivery was timely, quality of book as stated (used book), which is about as old as one we owned before. All in all we are happy to have the book again and the vendor is reliable. Got what we wanted for a very good price."
4,Surprised,When I first saw this product a couple of years ago there were never pictures of the sheaths on the back of the little guy. I never noticed it in the pictures here on amazon and when I got it I was shocked they changed the design. Luckily they break really easily and the knives are held in place by some strong magnets inside the hollow plastic shell. This thing is also friggin huge so be prepared to make some counter space for it.
5,"""EX"" knife set",This piece is a bit larger than I expected but it's still a unique addition to my kitchen. The knives are top quality! I definitely recommend as a gift or for personal use.
5,Not just a normal knife set,"I couldn't be happier if it could bleed. What a great knife set, high quality knives in a comical stand."
3,overpriced,"the base and the body are plastic, for the price It should be metal. the plastic blade protectors are big and ugly and stick out the back, one came broken with mine. I broke all of them off because it looks much better without them. there is a good strong magnet that holds the blades in place, i really like that feature. the knives look good, but are obviously not the best qualoity. overall a good product if that's the look you are after then get it. this product is really all about the look anyway."
1,Stainless steel? uhmmm...no,After 2 years of use some of the knives started to rust when they should be stainless steel. I liked the style but did not comply with the basic
3,"Cool display, knives...meh.","I have to say, the stand is pretty cool. A very interesting way to display the knives. It is big... so beware if you wanted a small easy to hide thing. Then again... if you wanted something easy to hide, why would you buy something so deserving of displaying?The knives themselves aren't that great, however. They are stainless steel... and they aren't super sharp. The small knife had some difficulty cutting a tomato. And if you leave the knives wet, they WILL show rust, or whatever it is... I'm not fluent in knife technical terms... Just be aware of these issues if you are to purchase this."
4,Modern Art Loveee!,"I love this knife set it's art yet it's functional! I was disappointed by it not being very heavy and it being made from hollow plastic! However he looks awesome and I bought him more as an art piece anyways. The knives are ok... but nothing really really special just ok knives! Functional yes they work but if your looking for a truly functional knife block just for knives I don't recommend this one for you! If you looking for a piece of art, and conversation starter this is for you! Definitely check out the voodoo toothpick holder as well, a great addiction to the set!"
4,Great knives cheap holder,Surprisingly the knives are great quality. The base is kind of cheap(made of plastic). Cool look however.
3,A good sense of humor is a must,"I bought this knife set while going through a divorce. I think it's hysterical and the quality of the knives are better than i anticipated. The only draw back is the odd looks i get from friends and family who don't think it's as funny as i do or who think my sense of humor is inappropriate, or just do get how satisfying it is to put knives through your ""ex"". Too bad for them, I guess. I would recommend this product especially to those who are a little twisted."
4,NY Cats: Cool NY Session Musicians Do Great Stuff,"John Tropea's first albums produced in the late 70's were amalgamations of competent session players producing a frenetic, but very slick sound.This continues with this set of songs that have both the competency of his earlier work with the verve of an ""almost"" live direct recording. No overdubs or re-mastering. It's ""get it right the first time"" and everyone playing has to be in the groove.This makes for a very edgy feel to the solid playing these folks do. They reprise one particularly good number, Tamborine. Tropea's guitar just glides along through the panoply of riffs that drives this tune.All in all, a very satisfying album."
3,"Decent sound, poor quality control","I found the sound on this unit very nice, especially for its size - if you are using it in a large room or expect great stereo imaging, you are going to be disappointed. If you are looking for something that can fit on a bedside table or dresser and sound great, then you will probably be pleased -- if you don't get a lemon.Mine also looses time, a few minutes a week, an unfortunate thing since I bought it as a CLOCK-radio. Luckily, it is easy to change the time, just a single key press, but you should not have to do that on a radio of this cost. The reception was fine in my old apartment, but I'm having problems in my new place, particularly with the AM, as others have mentioned.If it wasn't for these 2 issues, I would give it 5 stars -- the 2 alarms are great, the MP3 compatibility is nice and the small remote is helpful in reducing clutter."
1,"Sounds is awesome, CD player is broken by design","The sound quality of this unit is excellent for its form factor. I also own a Bose unit, and I can't stand to listen to it. The Cambridge unit is by far a superior sounding unit. The radio is great, the controls are pretty nice. BUT... the CD player is broken. It appears to be a design defect. I went through 2 units. On both units the CD player failed after a single CD was played and ejected. After that, it refused to accept another CD into the slot. I really wish they had stuck with a lift-top CD design instead of the motorized slot. I sent them both back, but I may still buy the radio-only version and plug in a separate CD player - the sound is that much better than anything else I've found."
3,Good Sound,"Just received this unit, on the whole it is quite nice. However, I also have a Bose Wave Radio CD and I must admit that the Bose edges out the Cambridge when you put them side by side. The Cambridge may be able to put out more volume but for total sound quality the Bose still gets my nod. The Cambridge offers more features than the Bose unit and costs substantially less, and if you can't play the Bose right next to it you may never know the difference, unfortunately, now I do...."
4,"So Far, So Good","It sounds very good and the ability to read MP3s in folders and identify the artist, song and album is great.FM reception is ok to good. Little static but then the house is brick/block and in a little valley so there's always been problems with reception.No quality problems so far but only had it a week. Assuming it holds up a couple of years, which I only question because of other reviews here, it will have been a good deal. I give it 4 stars because the sound is great, especially for the size yet it kills me to pay $350 bucks for something this small. But anything cheaper sounds tinny.Btw, I emailed Cambridge SoundWorks about the warrenty if you buy it from Amazon. They said that as long as you buy it from Amazon (as opposed to a third-party seller selling through Amazon) they will honor the warrenty. I guess Amazon is an authorized retailer."
3,"Defective, But Good Sound When it Works","IF CD WILL NOT EJECT... The machine says ""no disc"" and won't release the CD. Unfortunately, there is no movable tray so you're out of luck if you can't finesse the machine.First: Try holding the eject button down for several seconds.Next: Try unplugging the unit for a minute, then plug back in and try step one again if necessary.These remedies have worked for me so far. Other than that, it's an ugly little beast but it has solid sound for its size."
5,unbelieveable sound!,I got this for Christmas. It was on my wishlist after alot of research.I think the functions were pretty straightforward and had no problems setting the alarms. I cannot believe the sound. It's amazing and sounds like a huge soundsystem! I wanted it for an awesome clock radio in the bedroom and I often find myself moving into the living room for parties and get togethers because it sounds better than our big system!
3,Weak AM performance,The title says it all for me. Could not pull in AM stations that we frequently listen to. The CD player is fine but only plays one at at time.
4,no major compaint,"No major complain w/ the unit. For the amount of $ this unit cost, one would/should expect a lot. I'm not blown away by the sound, but I'm not dissapointed either.CD eject is not quite strong enough and I have to 'pull' the cd out every time. Not sure if it's defective or just the way it is.The time it allows one to change alarm setting is really short. I end up having to get into the change-alarm-mode several times in order to make a change. This should get better once one becomes more familiiar w/ the settings.One good thing about the unit is the slot loading. This allows me to pile stuff such as CD cases on top. The bose alarm cd is top loading so night stand space is vertically-challenged."
3,Great Product,This product was really great but much smaller then I expected. I bought it as a gift for somebody who has house on the ocean. We saw many dolphins with it.
3,DZ,"Good Album, Dweezil's Guitar intellect comes out on most tracks, his version of Peaches En Regalia is pretty cool and it has a nice ending."
2,"""Lotsa sizzle, not much steak"" from this brilliant artist","Five stars for Johnny, but just two stars for this effort from Mel Bay. Volume One contains three 16 bar solos repeated in four bar passages... actually only three pages of music in a 16 page book. It's packaged in heavy paper, with a picture collage, bio, and gear listing.Flat pick and/or finger pick? Lots of left hand detail, but none for the right.A cd is included so you can hear what it's supposed to sound like, but there are errors in the transcriptions. If you can pick them out by ear, you won't have a problem. Then again, if you can pick it up by ear, do you really need this book?"
2,Very small - Children sized grips,"I really can't say much about these clippers as I am physically unable to use them. Small is one thing, but these clippers are so small that only my pinky finger would fit into the grips. The trimmer is 3 1/8"" tall (without the pinky tang) and 2 1/8"" wide. The grip holes are 5/8"" tall and 3/4"" wide.The outer grip is hard plastic, and the finger openings are a slightly softer plastic (for better grip). The sides are held together by a basic rivet and seem solid enough. As mentioned, I cannot use this clipper, so am unable to discern how sharp they are or how well they will hold their sharpness.These are best for users with children-sized hands and for use on small animals (small birds & rodents.)"
5,great!,Inexpensive but not cheap!! Gets the job done and have had these clippers for a while now and they have been just fine!
4,I like these the best for our Guinea Pigs,"I wish there was something better for clipping little piggy nails, but as of yet I haven't found anything. The clippers are very sharp and cut cleanly. I have two pairs, one for the cat and one for the piggies."
3,Trimmer gets dull!,Couldn't clip my ferrets' toenails more than once. The nail clipper was dull! My fuzzies' nails were split and jagged so I had to get a pair of small dog toenail clippers to go back over them! This might be okay for a hamster's nails but definitely won't cut a ferrets thick(ish) nails! I clip my ferret's nails every week!!!
4,going downhill,"this is not a bad cd to buy. its still miles ahead of nashville country, and lifetime stand is an outstanding song. The biggest problem with this cd has to do with steel guitarist jimmy not being a part of cooder g on this cd. the result of this is that this cd has much more of a rock sound, this album lacks the country sound that previous albums had, on many tracks. the lyrics are still pretty tight. buy this cd but make sure you get shifting gears, live at billy bobs or golden light or the self title before you get this one, they are all superior 5-star efforts. sadly another texas country band is turning towards rock. for artists still playing texas country check out jason allen, cody widner, or front porch texas."
2,too many twists and misunderstandings,"The book contains too many twists and misunderstandings to keep the reader interested. If the author would have stopped at 200 pages or so, instead at 400, the chemistry between the lead characters would have stayed interesting. Now, all the many misunderstandings that keep popping up, make the book tiresome to read. Even for a historical romance, the frequent use of antique words and sentences became annoying."
2,Had a promising start,"This book left me empty. I've read several of Teresa Meseiros books and count alot of them as some of my favorite romances, not this one. It started out with alot of promise, but the ending was a flop. It was like someone else wrote the third part of the book. The hero Morgan never truely expresses all his true feelings to Sabrina. I love a good romance, but this just wasn't one, sad part is it could have been."
3,Almost special,"I picked up this book because I enjoyed Medeiros' ""The Bride and the Beast""-- it was different, charming, funny. But ""Whisper of Roses"" disappointed me. The last third of the book hinges on a Big Misunderstanding that seemed contrived. I was disturbed by the disconnect between Morgan's casual cruelty as a child, and his hidden gentleness as a man; it didn't seem real to me. Sabrina's own transformation from a sweet natured woman into an embittered invalid made more sense to me, but also did not ring entirely true. I felt like these characters gave up on their love a bit too easily. I felt like Morgan's strategy of goading Sabrina out of self-pity was a craven way to help his lover. He could have established the same by showing her his love for her to lend her courage."
3,A Whisper of Roses,"I thought this was a spectacular book until I came to the end. The writing and story are excellent, but the author tries to do to much. The story would have ended nicely after the heroine, Sabrina Cameron, has her accident. She would have to heal of course, but the general idea remains the same. Instead, she leaves the hero, Morgan MacDonnell, and turns into a whiny, selfish brat. She is very annoying towards the end, and Morgan would have left her if he had any sense. If you can see past the horrible ending, you will enjoy this book. The story line and writing and basically very good. Ms. Medeiros uses wonderful prose to create intense love between a Scottish man and woman in the days of the proud Highland lairds."
3,it was a good story,"I loved the beginning, but felt the ending dragged a bit. all in all it was a good book but not Medeiros's best"
4,It was good!,I loved the first half of the book. The part where she got into an accident and so forth wasn't to my liking. The ending was good!
2,Too much graphic description of things best left unsaid...,"This book would have been great adventure with an admirable main character but I don't find it entertaining to read descriptions of how difficult it is to wipe one's butt in prison, or how one character had sex with sheep. I prefer some things to be hinted at rather than have to wade through a detailed description. After a while, the casual lewdness and perversity of some of the characters disgusted me and I could not finish the book."
2,Ho Hum,"What an unbelievably boring book! It's a bunch of facts and numbers and dates strung together - as if the author was bound and determined to use every bit of historical research that she had found. The main character is a stick - the story is supposed to show how he became a stronger and better man through adversity and hardship, but instead he is so perfect and aloof and godlike, he isn't interesting or sympathetic at all. I was very disappointed in this book, because I had really enjoyed her previous books. The Thorn Birds, An Indecent Obsession, A Creed for the Third Millenium all had far more interesting and believable characters, and storylines that were far more engrossing and weren't sacrificed to historical detail. I plowed my way through Morgan's Run, hoping the story would finally take off, but it never did."
3,Interesting history but not for the squeamish.,"Morgan's Run is an ambitious and engaging novel but it simply does not rise to the level of magical excellence we are accustomed to from Colleen McCullough. More than half the book is completed before our convict hero arrives in Australia. And most of these 334 pages (and those that follow) are devoted to vivid descriptions of the revolting conditions of 18th century English prisons and the slave ships used to transport convicts to Australia. This novel simply staggers under its weight of human filth, excrement, vermin, disease, suffering, cruelty, and starvation. I'm sure it is true to the savage history of the time, but I would have enjoyed a little more novel as a contrast. Much history can be learned from Morgan's Run but it isn't for the squeamish reader."
2,Good story/Boring read,"The jacket cover of Morgan's Run implies that this novel is as sweeping in scope and emotion as ""The Thorn Birds"". Although the story is wonderful, it's the telling that is stagnant. Instead of a compelling novel of intrigue, emotion and three dimentional characters, this book reads like a dry history chronicle. It tells a story, but lacks the insight to satisfy the reader. Maybe the problem is that the publishers promised a ""Thorn Birds"" but delivered a 19th century history primer."
4,Morgan's Run by Colleen McCullough,"Morgan's Run gets off to a slow start with in-depth background description. Once past the initial basic information of the story, Morgan's Run becomes a book that is hard to put down.Convicted unfairly of a crime whose penalty is seven years and transportation, Richard Morgan learns to live as a prisoner. Life aboard the prison ship is a job in itself to stay alive.Arriving in Botany Bay, Richard plies his trade as a gunsmith to the building of a convict community. Having lost his wife and child to death before being sentenced, he lives alone and desires no woman. As more and more convicts arrive, living quarters become sparse and each is required to take in a convict. A frightened young girl, half his age, ends up in his house and thus begins the thawing of his heart. Richard finishes his sentence and deems to stay in this new land and with his new love."
4,Once you've forgiven her for not writing about Ceasar ....,".... you'll have a splendid time learning about life in England and New South Wales during the 1780's. McCullough is a teacher with a gift for writing and I had a great time with the story. Not as scholarly as the Masters of Rome Series, but I'm guessing her publisher insisted upon her producing something that appeals to a wider market. I have a new appreciation for the Australian's and was shocked to learn about the unfairness of the English court system during those times. This will be a great follow-up to the summer Olympics ... get a glimpse of that beautiful harbor as it was 220 years ago and let the spirit of Richard Morgan inspire you in the same way that some of your favorite athletes have!"
5,History At Its Best,"What a wonderful way to learn history! Take a certain period, take a special group of people (the convicts), transport them around the globe, under horrible conditions. Then see what strong spirits and resourcefulness can accomplish. I found Richard Morgan to be that perfect central character--strong, focused, weak in self esteem, but strong in his faith and dedicated to survival. I truly look forward to continuation of his life and times, which the author promises us...GO, GIRL!"
3,Morgan's Run,"I didn't enjoy this book as much as other Colleen McCullough's works. Morgan's Run was a little dry for me, but that doesn't mean that others wouldn't enjoy it."
3,Great History; Morgan a bit 'too' good,"I really enjoy C. McCullough's books. Her thorough research is much appreciated and she crafts a tale very well. My only reservation about 'Morgan's Run' is the perfection of the hero. Leon Uris's hero in 'Trinity' suffers from the same flawless qualities which make it hard for mere mortals, like myself, to identify. 'Brule', a western adventure tale, set in the mid to late 19th century features another such demigod. Perhaps it's just me, but I find it off-putting when the main character has no flaws.Aside from that caveat, you should find Morgan's Run up to McCullough's high standards. My three-star rating would be high were Morgan himself a bit more normal."
3,Epic,"Morgan's Run is one of those novels that start off incredibly slow and creep along building up momentum until you finally find yourself caught up in the story of the hero. The plight of Richard, our hero, is a sad one and I can remember on more than one occasion thinking, ""What other catastrophe can happen to this guy?"" and yet Richard pulls through in the end as any hero will do.Although the plot lags, McCullough's writing talents pass with flying colors when it comes to descriptions and long passages of exposition. You can tell she researched 18th century shipping and the founding of Australia extensively which definitely qualifies this novel in the rare breed of historical novels that are actually true to history.If you have the time and are interested in the period I would recommend Morgan's Run, but if you are just looking for a good adventure/historical novel pass on by this one."
3,A huge read,"This is the first of Colleen McCullough's books that I have read, and having visited Norfolk Island, I was interested in the history as well as the semi-fictional side to the novel. It is so thoroughly researched with so much historical detail, I must admit it is very hard going, and had I not had an interest in Norfolk Island to begin with, I don't know if I could have finished the whole book. However, once the main character starts to build a life for himself on the Island it becomes a far easier read and for me, held more interest.Colleen McCullough is currently suffering failing eyesight and I sincerely hope she manages to write a sequel to this novel."
4,A tough read but rewarding,"This was a dark but enlightening read as to life in parts of Britain in the 1700s, and also the journey to the first penal colony in Australia. Characters are well-developed, Richard Morgan can be a hero for us all. Had tried to read Robert Hugh's Fatal Shore but quit half way through. Will go back and try it again. Great book for history buffs."
2,slow going,"I'm glad I've read it, now that it's over, for the book provided many interesting historical details; however, as fiction it is less than first rate, particularly because of the slow pacing. I think 3/4 of the book was over before the characters ever made it to Australia. Also, the main character, Richard Morgan, did not have as much depth or complexity as I would have liked; at times he seemed to be too perfect, to have risen to a position of leadership and sustained good judgment too easily or quickly. Still, there were many fascinating details in the story."
3,Didn't sustain my interest,"I made it through about the first two-thirds of the book. I really did feel suspense about whether they would EVER make it to Australian. I felt like I was on that transport ship, it took so long. Once Morgan was in Australian my interest rapidly waned. I think it was because he was such a cold fish. There seemed to be no driving force in his life, no romance, no burning desire to do anything. At best, he came across as an able manager. Yawn."
2,Not Enough Australia,"Being a big fan of The Thorn Birds, I was hoping for a novel set mainly in Australia. But after 300-plus pages with the protagonist still in England, I just couldn't muster the interest to finish."
2,"Lengthy, tedious, disconnected, poorly written.","I found this book extremely difficult going. The story, while somewhat interesting unfolded excruciating slowly and the writing style did not flow smoothly. Additionally too many extraneous characters with little or no development cropped up incessantly. Frankly I lost all interest in the characters and the story by the middle of the book and I had to force myself to get there. A cardinal rule I've employed in reading books is that I abandon them if they fail to please and by 2/3rds of the way through this book I gave up on it. I only made it that far because of previous efforts which were far better on McCullough's part."
2,Slow going,"I have to admit that I abandoned the book halfway through. Although I was expecting a story about the hardships of settling in the penal colony of Australia, I reached the novel's midpoint and Morgan was still on the convict ship, sailing past the coast of Europe. I grew tired of reading about fouled bilge pumps, shipboard diseases, and the quarrels among the ship's officers.Richard Morgan was a cardboard cutout of a protagonist. His personality radically changed, according the situation at hand, from a quiet tavernkeeper's son to a rum-sotted grieving father to a wise leader of men. Morgan seemed to be no more than a vehicle for the author's detailed treatises on 18th century England and Australia and their history, public health issues, criminal justice system, and shipboard life.If you are a historical novel buff with a preference for the factual over the fictional, then perhaps this novel is for you. It did not appeal to me."
2,Historically Accurate,"Morgan's Run is historically accurate when it comes to dates, facts, and the experiences of a person who is sent to a penal colony. Although this novel did not hold my interest in the way that the Thorn Birds did, I persevered and finished it because I wanted to learn something new. One thing that stands out about the novel is how McCullough does an excellent job of describing what life was like on a penal colony and I almost feel as if I am Richard Morgan."
3,Half way through and he isn't even in Australia yet!!!,"We chose this for our book club---only one of us finished it. It read as if the author had done all this research and she was bound and determined to include ALL of it. We chose this book because one of our members had visited another member while she spent a year in Australia and because we all fondly remembered enjoying ""Thornbirds"". I may pick it up where I left off and continue skimming through it but would not recommend this book."
5,If you liked the others...,"This is a wonderful book. The author's excellent record with dogs is maintained with this book. No dog lover should be without it. This one does not have Irish setters, but even you die-hard Irish setter fans will love this one."
1,Disappointed,"After hearing great reviews and personal experience with 10"" CMT table saw blades, I thought I'd give these a go for the jointer. To my surprise and disappointment, both these, and a 15"" set I bought for the planer were far from sharp. In fact, my old set still on the planer and jointer are sharper than these! I have no choice but to have them sharpened before use."
4,Good for supports,"In my game style, I need to run a lot some times or be silent and able to go trought small places.Eventually the sides of this equipment hits the obstacles.With a lot of training you get the position and the notion for going into room and small spaces.The noise problem I solved with some cloth into the pods,for not shaking and do that terrible ball orchestra.That's it!"
2,Holes not big enough!,"I bought this thinking it would be a useful item mainly because I eat so many peppers of all kinds. When I got it in the mail, I was disappointed to find that the holes in it will hold only the smallest of peppers. All the Jalepenos at the grocery store (and I went to 3 of them looking) were all too large to fit. Even my homegrown peppers are way too big, and end up just falling ofer spilling the fillings out all over the grill. I have spent some time filing out the holes which has helped somewhat, but basically these roasters are for serranos and other very small chiles."
3,Works... But,"This certainly works but, as mentioned by several other reviewers, the holes are a tad small and the peppers tend to fall over. I dealt with this by putting a wood skewer through several rows of peppers.Since everyone likes the roasted jalapenos, I ended up purchasing another rack which holds 18 peppers and has slightly larger holes."
2,Waste of money,"This rack did not do well at all. The peppers simply fell over and would not stay tucked into the holes. It might work for tiny jalapenos, but who wants to try to stuff peppers that small?"
4,Daily Refresher,"If you've read the many books contained in the ""Everyman Series"" this is a great daily refresher."
5,Becoming a Stronger Christian Man,"This is a quality book at a very good price. I encourage every man, any age, to read this daily devotional. My husband lost his and asked for a replacement, as it has helped him 'look' at situations differently, and how to address things properly, and in a Godly manner.Highly recommend."
4,The books are better.,This is a compilation of exerts from the book series. I think the actual books are great (and better than this).
4,Third Person RPG,"Having actually seen the game unlike the other reviewers, this game seems to have great graphics. It's similar to modern RPG's like Diablo 2 and Everquest, but not as crackfiendish. Good Stuff"
2,Decent gameplay.. not much else.,"I Purchased this game with high hopes but was bitterly disapointed. The game play was quite ok but the repetitive running from one place to another bugged me a bit... I was also astonished by the poor quality of graphics (apart from couple of flashy special effects). Some of the reviews led me to expect quite the opposite... I wouldn't have bought this, had I had better knowledge of the game. I've played better games than this"
5,One of the best RPGs available to the Mac,"Truly one of the greatest RPGs you can buy by for the Mac. This game has incredible graphics, and a pro soundtrack to match it. With a great story, awesome character art, and an interface easy to manage you can't go wrong with this title! I highly recommend it!"
3,"Decent Story, But Lousy Game Play.","I bought this game in hopes of purchising an exiting and happy game. However the music is creapy and dark, and half of the time you'r running through a dark dungeon trying to stab the guts through odd looking pirate people. Plus the graphics are pittyful. Their mouths barely move when they speak, and on top of that the combat mode is extremely boring, all you have to do is repeativly click the mouse until the enemy drops dead. But so far I'm not very far into the game so who knows, things might get better."
4,Great little ammo belt,Got this to hold 7.62X54 rounds. It holds them in with a snug fit. Great for over the shoulder. For around the waist maybe up to a 52 inch waist then it goes over the shoulder. Well made product.
5,Holds my 3006 pretty snug,"Product is hanging on closet next to my gear,not one bullet has fallen off of it and it has been thrown around in there bumped and hit and still not one has fallen.If you need a belt for your bullets get it.I also have molle pouches for shotguns and rifle and when used in combination it leaves alot of ammo to be carried."
3,Ok product,Well made ammo belt for the money however the clasp is a bit too tight for unfastening. A lil filing in store.
4,Rock Solid Writing,"St Claire hits another solid one. While this may not be out of the park for me like some of her others, it was still a very well-written book. The premise certainly can't be said to be run-of-the-mill nor can the characters. The heroine is desperate for answers about her roommate's death. She knows it wasn't a suicide and she is willing to do anything to get the information. That includes offering her body if she has to.The hero, one of St. Claire's always sexy, always alpha Bullet Catchers, is trying to infiltrate the organization who offers up ""romantic"" kidnappings and other edgy sexual fantasies. St. Claire delves into a very dark world with this book and does it well.I recommend this one to anyone who likes their suspense taut, dark and edgy."
4,"Progressive,Soulful well written music.Great musicians!","This is one great CD way ahead of it's time. A great group of musicians based out of Columbus,Ohio. Thank God it is NOT Electronica kind of music and,sounds not anywhere in the least like Prince. There are alot of well written progressive tracks on this CD. Very tastefully put together and soulful harmony vocals. It's funky,rockin' sometimes way out there. Do yourself a favor and at least give it a try.I'm very familiar with this group/CD because we were recording a CD at the same studio around the same time frame. Also the track listings are not correct on the Amazon site."
2,Not what you think,This is not the electronica group Zero One. But instead a band that ripped off Prince. Stay away and beware.
3,good,"Not memorable but good enough for a late evening jazz music session at home, when you are not able to go out to a great Jazz club."
1,Very poorly made,"Obviously, people who put this together wanted to do it quickly...A narrator with a boring voice, poorly written text and you feel no enthusiasm, no love, no excitation.. Such a pity, with a competent group that loves the game this could have been a beuatiful thing to watch... Don't waste your money!"
1,Thank You,Was going to purchase all these DVD'S but thanks to the reviews I haven't. My partner would have been so upset if they are as bad as you say they are. Thanks Guys!
3,good if u take care of it,"i used this for about 5 months, and it was good, given the $45 price tag. then today i dropped it, u know, from like waist-high, and....it stopped working.... i've taken it running with me, and it does well, but it shouldnt break from a 4 foot fall"
5,"Worth $20,000.00!","That's how much extra I was able to earn in just the first year! This sensational money machine is brought to you by Barry Farber; president of Farber Training Systems Inc. For over 30 years he's been out in the field achiving financial miracles in sales and management for AT&T, Guest Quarters Suite Hotels, Minolta, Schering-Plough, Val-Pak, Weavers, and many other large and small sales endeavors worldwide. This 12 lesson course really teaches new levels of success with unique strategies. You won't be sorry!"
1,"No Spare Parts, foot plate easily lost DO NOT BUY","For $49, I expected a much more substantial product. I contacted NGS for a spare part (foot plate) which is EASILY dislodged, and they directed me to Tundra, which does not exist. All sites referred me back to NGS. I call FOUL."
3,Great lightweight monopod with one serious flaw...,"I really like this monopod. I didn't use the head because I don't need to pan, I'm more interested in using it outside for taking shots and if I wanted to pan, I'd bring my tripod. My only complaint is that the foot comes off, easily without any effort. Under the foot is just a tiny ball, which will easily be damaged after a hike or a day out on the town."
3,Not bad for the price,"Some people review these kind of things and get all bent out of shape when something goes wrong with it. This is a reasonably priced monopod. Do not expect the same as one that is double or even triple the price. You get what you pay for. Don't forget, this also comes with a swivel head. Most of your higher end models make you buy that separately. For occasional use, this is fine. Although, a day after I received it, the whole foot assembly came off. Not just the bottom piece that other reviews talk about. With a little super glue, it is fixed though. Also the swivel head is a bit cheap and made of plastic. If you have a larger camera and lens like I do, it is probably going to be a problem. But, again, for the price and occasional use, what more can you ask for."
5,Good Value - Works Well,"I recently bought one of these monopods. I hike a lot around Washington and Oregon and sometimes the telephoto VR needs a little help. I have taken it out twice and it has functioned very well as a monopod. (A monopod is not a tripod and will not replace a tripod for certain uses.) This one works very well for it's intended use. As far as the foot falling off or being lost, there is a simple cure. I read the reviews about the ""loose"" foot so I used a strip of fiberglass strapping tape to close the slot used for detaching the foot. Depending on the tape strength, or you strength, you can get just a little compression. The foot is secure and the fix is reversible and in no way interferes with the function of the foot. Buy it now!"
3,Just shy of being great....,"This book contains lots of useful information for the budding Baysian. Excellent discussions on many topics. However, I have to give this only 3 stars, because on a cardinal point, the authors give very bad advice: they give the impression that Komogorov complexity-based methods are ill motivated. In fact, Kolmogorov complexity is one of the most fruitful new developments in Baysianism, and I have personally used it many times in industrial settings to solve otherwise intractible problems.However, on most points the book is very useful. I recommend buying the first edition over the second, because the second edition doesn't really add that much useful info over the first. I also recommend buying in addition to this book Ming Li and Paul Vianyi's book on Kolmogorov complexity, for a comprehensive intro to a whole wonderland of Baysianism which Howson & Urbach have overlooked."
2,just a philosophy book for beginners,"[1] Both authors are philosophers, not mathematicians.[2] If you are interested in the philosophy of Bayesianism, Probability Theory : The Logic of Science by E. T. Jaynes is definitely better.[3] The knowledge required for reading this book is almost nothing, so it is useful to complete beginners of probability theory.[4] Good Bayesian guys are always good philosophers and skilled at traditional theories. So what? Read the books written by good Bayesian mathematicians.[5] The title is awesome, but the content is not commensurate."
4,Mopar book,This is a well written book that takes you step by step through the engine rebuild process. Whether you`re a novice or experienced with rebuilding big block Mopars there`s something here for you. I would highly recommend this book.
3,"Good Info,Though somewhat out-dated","The info presented is very helpful for the novice builder with plenty of background on what can and cannot interchange between engine models/years.My only gripe is the actual print and photos look more like copies instead of fresh print, washed out looking, and some of the info is getting pretty outdated as far as techniques and up to date products availabe are concerned. Needs an up-date. That said I do not regret the purchase and would still recommend this book for any how to DIYer. I would have given it 4 stars if not for the poor print quality."
2,You'll need a lot more than this book to pass.,"I just took the exam, and trust me, this book simply doesn't go far enough. Some material on the exam doesn't even appear in this book, and other material goes in to much more detail than the book does. Example: visual basic scripting; I got a couple of questions that required some knowledge of VBS, but this book didn't touch it. Another example: using the automated system recovery tool is covered, but not in enough detail to help you pass. I also upgraded, for about $60, the test and took, and scored very high on the four practice tests. These tests bear no resemblance to the real thing in form or content. Little help, if any. If you want to pass, find another book."
4,A great tool to use on your way to passing...,"It took me about 2 months to work though this book, and it was worth every minute of it. I used this book and a small at home lab I set up to test out some of hands on work before writing. All of this and the TWO practice exams PLUS the PrepLogic exam that is on CD was the best tool I needed to pass the exam. And pass the exam I did. I've been a fan of the Exam Cram series for years and again they have not disappointed me. There may seem to be a lot of information to cover... but it's all well worth it. Thanks Que Publishing for helping me out yet again."
4,Good review before test day!,"I would recommend this book to anybody that is about to take 70-290. I would say a word of caution though about this book. It is truly intended to be a suppliment to actual training from either a interactive self-paced class like Test Out or Prep Logic. If you try to pass the 70-290 with this book alone you may run in to difficulty. Also, I would recommend exam insurance from Microsoft if your testing center allows it."
3,Good book with easy simultion exam questions,"This book is a great way to start studying the 70-290 Exam. It is well organized and tries to cover most of the topics. The book is interesting and useful as a reference book for the real life.Unfortunately this book does not cover all the objectives for the exam. For example for the SUS topic it contains less than one page of information. For IIS and printers, it is the same problem.Some other books like Sybex contain an entire chapter !!.There are some topics with shallow information.I strongly recommend this book for beginners. With the help of the TechNet and a practice exam (like Boson or transcender), you can pass the exam.The CD does not contain questions similar than the real exam. It would be great if the CD contained simulation questions and more questions like the real exam."
3,You'll need more than this book will provide.,"This book is not enough to pass the exam, at least the exam I received. To many holes on security. My test was 1/2 security type questions and needless to say I did not pass. I did have a home test lab and did every lab at least twice. In my lab I had 98, 2k, and XP home and Xp Pro. I do have extended experience in the networking world. I did buy the XP Pro Manual as well and I am equally disappointed. I did purchaced additional manuals to pass the the tests. Exam Cram manuals WERE one of the best."
2,"Like I said, dont expect to pass with this review guide",Chapter 3 covers GPO's? Then someone has played a cruel joke on me. Like I said in my previous post: this exam cram is insufficient! My chapter 3 is nothing but managing server storage! How to convert to dynamic disks etc. The acronym GPO is nowhere to be found. I DO read the books I review! I want a refund.
1,Not worth ten dollars,There are some good drills for the 4-3-3 but the video is dubbed and very dry to watch. They do not diagram the drills at all. It's strictly view and learn. So you have to watch them do the drills over and over to figure them out. The video is also short and does not give a very good overview of the 4-3-3 system. It's missing a lot of how to make the formation work.I would recommend getting a book that's in english and avoid this dubbed and clouded dvd if you want to learn more about the 4-3-3.
2,Lack relevant information,"As one reviewer rightfully said,it lacks info on how to make the system work and merely focuses on attacking schemes only.It lacks clarity as to the roles and fucntion of the midfielders,attackers and wingers.The videos largely focuses on the role of the wingbacks and their over-lapping runs,that's all.This w3as the only good aspect of the video and has some clear drills on how to implement that aspect only."
4,What a gorgeous movie!,"Okay, so it was slow at times. I thought Minnie Driver's portrayal of a Victorian era Jewess was haunting. She is tall, thin and beautiful to behold on film. The Mr. Cavendish role played by the same man in The Full Monty (he get's nekkid in this one, too) was at times excruciating to watch. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is a revealation as Henry. He should have gotten more screen time. I kept wishing all throughout the movie that Minnie's character would would be involved w/ Jonathan but no such luck. I short, I bought this film because I think Minnie is a fabulous actress but the pleasant surprise was Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as the beauteous Henry."
3,What have you done to me Miss Blackchurch!,"There are some good things in this movie....then there are also some bad...Bad first-The dialogue in some places seems extremely over the top. Tom Wilkinson and Minne Driver do not seem comfortable at all in the somewhat silly love scenes that are laced through the movie.Good-Strong soundtrack. Strong acting. Especially Jonathan Rhys Meyer's portrayal of Henry...This movie made me sorely want to take him to Mcdonald's and handfeed him french fries....and Big Mac's while petting his pretty little face....Clementina was an espcially interesting character.Well, that's all....TA!"
5,I loved this movie!,"Minnie Driver was excellent and Tom Wilkinson took my breath away. The passion he showed in his eyes was beautiful and he is a fine, fine actor. I loved his nude scene, we need to see more older men like that...being sensual and real. If I see anymore depictions of one dimensional sexuality(older men running around subways with guns drawn to win over some Barbie Doll)I'm going to spit.The plot was interesting and the characters were well cast. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was great, as always. The photography was gorgeous. I just loved this movie!"
3,Eye Candy,"The strength of this film is not in the plot or the depth of characters. In 19th Century London, a wealthy Jewish merchant is murdered and, for some unknown reason, leaves his family destitute. His intelligent and ambitious daughter pretends to be Christian in order to accept a position as governess for a dysfunctional family living in Scotland. She immediately, and simplistically, wins over her charge, an irritating little girl. Soon , the governess becomes an assistant to the reclusive father who is obsessed with finding a way to preserve photo images. Add a discontented mother who hates being stuck in Scotland and an obsessive post-adolescent son and you have a standard plot. What makes ""The Governess"" so enjoyable are the beautiful and intriguing images of the people and places. The film is candy for the eyes. Sit back and enjoy the sights and don't worry too much about the plot."
4,Minnie Driver is fantastic. Beautiful photography,For such a solemn movie you really appreciate it when Ms. Blackchurch (Minnie Driver) cracks a joke. I laughed when she said the Madame had a lemon up her posterior. The scene where she handed Madame a naked photograph of her husband was so deserved. (woman power)
2,I'm afraid I lost interest quickly,"Beautiful cinematography, wonderful cast, lush costumes and locations, and a completely soggy script *sigh*I'm a big fan of period pieces, and love Mini Driver, but really, I couldn't sit through this film in its entirety. I ejected the disk about half way through, and went and read a book."
1,This throw looks nothing like the picture!,"When ordering this product it was the picture that caught my attention.The colors would have been perfect, When I got it, I was hoping that the hideous colors meant that the throw was showing the back side. It wasn't. Very disappointed. Quality of size and weight was nice but it is nothing like the picture."
3,Not the complete original,"I was disappointed to find that this is apparently an abridged version of the book I remember from my childhood, and a number of poems are not included.On the good side, the illustrations are just as wonderfully creepy as I remember, which I was a bit concerned about given the cartoonish cover.Go with the original if you can find one in reasonable condition!"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"In my opinion, this book is a waste of time and money. The book description leads you to believe there are actual exercises in the book to help hiatal hernia. There is one page which tells you to put your hand on your stomach and concentrate on your stomach doing down into place. I could not have been more disappointed with this book."
1,Pseudo-scientific garbage. Don't be duped,"Ask yourself why double-blind, placebo controlled studies couldn't be done for this technique? They could, but this isn't science, it's nonsense. If this actually worked, it could be tested and showed to work."
3,Couldn't make up my mind!,"I picked the book out because I read the woman was working in a fire tower, and Ranger Gord happens to be my fav. Red Green SHow charactor so I figured I'd see what it was about (And there WAS a Ranger gord in this story, how ironic:)I'm 16 years old so I'm not quite used to reading literature so erotic and bold when it comes to sexual content. It scared me a little at first, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue the book or not, but I did and I'm glad I did! I thought that perhaps, like the one girl in seattle said, maybe I'm just a bit too immature to be reading something like this. but I thought what the heck, and put myself past it. It's not like I'm not used to swearing and talking about sex, heck, I go to hight school, lol.The book had a powerful menaing to it, all about finding you true inner self and what's important to yourself. It's about learning to tell apart the truth from the lies you tell yourself. Good book."
2,not child appropriate,"yes this book had many ways of stating life, but it was a disturbing teenage child/teen hood. I thought it could of been more appropriate and should of been rated higher than teen status."
5,You want what you paid for right? You got it!!,"The title to this book says it all literally. I was skeptical at first and I thought the title was just hype to sell the book but after reading half of it in one setting, I was totally wrong. For the average guy with basic knowledge on the subject, this book is sure to build on that. What I love most about this book is when you read about countermeasures and all that stuff you also learn about the measures taken by operators. It's all how you read the book. This book is very detailed and amusing at the same time. The things people plan against you are very well thought out. The countermeasures are also genius. Once again, the title holds great justice to the material inside. Furthermore, the tactics in this book are still being used today if this helps you when debating on purchasing this book."
2,"its about being followed, but does not cover other surveillance","This book is about detecting people who are following you, and observing your activities. It unfortunately does not cover countermeasures to other kinds of surveillance, such as video surveillance, which has become prevelant in our time."
1,Compendium,"Sadly, this is a compendium of other peoples work. There are better sources for this information."
4,OfficeScan 5.0 for SBS 2000,"OfficeScan for SBS 2000 is easy to install, easy to use, and easy to maintain. The web management console is intuative and makes it easy to check the network status from any PC whether you're on site or off site. The best antivirus value I've seen since it gives you Exchange mail server protection AND client protection."
5,A delicious concoction,"Take one eccentric, down at heels detective, mix with a cast of colorful, offbeat characters, toss in a crash course in art history and forgery, add a soupcon of homicide and sex and you have Nicholas Kilmer's latest installment in the Fred Taylor mystery series. The plot, which has more twists than a barrel of pretzels, turns on the question of whether a painted chest, of dubious origin, is or is not a creation of Leonardo Da Vinci. A delight for various ages and tastes.Ron Katz"
5,Very Funny Dog Cartoon,"This is one of the funniest cartoons I have ever seen. Saw it on TV 20 years ago and was thrilled to see it was available on a VCR tape.The dog in this movie is so funny but it is also true to life, too.Would recommend this for everyone regardless of your age."
3,A bit disappointed.,I got this for my niece who will be 8. This was a bit large for her to handle. She kept tipping it. The fog rings are also very hard to see. BUT she said she really liked it even thought I offered to get her something else. Will check up with her mom and see if she is still excited about it.
2,"Nice idea, less than stellar implementation","My unit's sound quality was terrible. No bass, just sounded like an old transistor radio.Also, where you plug in the headphone did not make a solid connection. Don't know if it was just my unit but it's going back."
4,3 stars,"McKiernan goes off onto a new path with this 1st book in his Faery series. Its a fairly decent book and it truly has the feeling of an old fashioned fairy tale, just as a longer version.Oh, and ignore reviewers like E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"" . What type of person reads every book from an author they hate? That's what E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas"" does so it limits any attempt at credibility on his part. Amazon should have some way to remove mindless trolls like that guy."
4,Great Fun!,"I purchased this game with high hopes (Having played Chariots of War and loved it) and this game met those expectations well. Spartan provides a different style of play from Chariots of War, and is in some ways an entirely different game - it is definately much harder (if one continues playing after victory)! Spartan also has great maps and the new commands in battle add a whole new dynamic that makes the game truely something! I would definately reccomend this game to anyone! It is a great way to play a nice quick half-an-hour game or a VERY long campaign across the Hellenic world."
2,Boring.,"The only way to win this game is to sit back and build, never, or almost never going to war. Where's the fun in that?"
3,Poor graphics made a good game average.,"Wonderful set-up and game play but why give so much attention to the campaign game, types of units and battle modifiers and forget about the graphics engine."
2,One piece,Pictures of item always show 3 bushings but there is only one and it is a pain to install. Other kits include atleast 2.
1,A Snorefest,"First of this review only concerns the 1 hour and 54 minute streaming video of the documentary on Amazon.com, which is one of the most utterly boring things I've ever watched. Don't get me wrong, I think Cream was an extraordinary group that had an amazing magnitude of truly great work in the few short years they were together. I also think Eric Clapton is one of the greatest musicians of our time. But this thing is just mind-numbing in it's detail of minutiae. I don't typically like ""rockumentaries"" in the first place, but if you are going to do one, do it right and spend more time talking about the music. The Classic Albums line of documentaries does a better job of this, see the one about Deep Purple's Machine Head for a good example. But two hours of who said what to who is just not worth watching unless you deeply care in the minutiae of other people's lives."
1,nothing new waste of money,I had high expectations regarding the dvd/cd and here is the result: cd with stockholm concert was many times issued on bootlegs so it came as no surprise with same sound effect. DVD has plenty of interviews and the songs from revolutionary club were issued on dvd fresh live cream.Huge dissapointment is coming from no performance in 1993 (Hall of fame) and 2005 (Madison) they only interview people about the concert - joke or what? Better buy Jack Bruce Cream of Cream dvd.
4,An Essential purchase for any Cream Fan!,"A two-disc set comprising of interviews,video clips and live music, this is a highly entertaining collection with Jack Bruce,Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker telling us in their own words how the world's first supergroup formed, hit the top of the charts with such hits as Sunshine of Your Love and White Room, then self destructed in just a few short years, only to reform for the celebrated 2005 Cream at Albert Hall concerts. Poet Pete Brown, who had a hand in most of Creams songs, also is interviewed.The only complaint I have about the main program is Ginger Baker who comes across as as quite bitter and unrelenting in his interview when commenting about Jack Bruce. One would think that Ginger would have mellowed out a bit over the years, but sadly it isn't so! But the fantastic music more than makes up for it."
3,"""Where's the Beef?""","There some great interviews on here, with Cream and people affiliated with them. But after a while it gets to be too much talk and not enough action. It would have been great to hear some musical clips to accompany the interviews.Also, the one extra interview I listened to with Solomon Burke and B.B. King, does not mention Cream at all."
3,No video on the 'songs' CD,"I was very disappointed that there was no video included on the 2nd 'songs' CD. The 2nd CD only featured 5 songs, but that would have been fine if they had included video of the band playing the songs. The first CD was actually quite good and quite long, but with no video on the second CD, the 2 CD package was disappointing overall."
4,Classic Footage of a Classic Artist,"Just like the Classic Artists DVD about the making of Disraeli Gears, the extras included on this disk make it worth the price. Live footage of a rehearsal or sound check from the Revolution Club of Tales, Sunshine, and an amazing version of Spoonful blow away anything from the Farewell DVD in terms of picture-quality and sound. This is clearly from the era of Live Cream II; they're even wearing the same clothes seen on the cover of that album. Also among the extra interviews, one with Ginger is a present-day 5-minute segment of him wailing away on his drums in his practice space, followed by a tour of his farm. Much, much better than the Chris Welch/Pete Brown piece of junk from a couple of years ago."
1,A complete waste of time,"This is a book about a woman that got treated poorly by everybody she met. She worked at the worst possible corporations in America and then she wrote a book about it.I am a minority and have suffered a lot more discrimination and subtle insults than I care to remember. This book did nothing for me. It is just a collection of complaints and repeticious hateful messages agains men. The interested reader will benefit a lot more from reading books like ""The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-defense""."
5,Woman who identifies with this book,"As a female in the corporate world, I found this book very insightful. I am ready to make changes and have already started using some of the stratagies. For me, this book came at the right time."
5,Amazon did me worng,"The kits are good once I got them. But Amazon sent me the wrong ones. They sent me 8"" kits. They tried to help me out by offering me a 20% discount on the wrong part. That does not help if you are installing 6.5"" speakers. I call SmartHome who Amazon order them from and got the correct part to my house over night. This sounds like a simple thing to do but Amazon could not do it for me. Looks like going through Amazon was not the best way to get this part. Keep this in mind when ordering this."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ONE,"This has to be the worst book ever. It is dry, boring and very difficult to read. Some of the stories tell you how to cheat and a lot of them are just meaningless. I threw this book in the trash, I didn't want anyone else to have to endure this GARBAGE!!"
5,One of the best,I really like this CD. Music are insperational & easy listening. Good for evening relaxation knowing that after a long day there is a God who love & care for you deeply.
3,It's okay,"A little to new age feel to it personally.Some very good songs, others okay. I expected more."
4,"Beautiful, soul soothing music","Grace and peace to you from God our Father. A loving reminder of God's compassion. Most of the songs are reflective and meditative, a few are not and disrupt the flow . . . but otherwise a great album. So 4 instead of 5 stars. Still very much worth it if you're a Fernando Ortega fan (or even if you're not). If you like loud Contemporary Christian rock music, don't get this, you'll be disappointed. If you like intelligent lyrics, music that draws you to God, and sets a peaceful mood, you'll be pleased."
5,Sharp looking tip and easy to install,"Bought this exhaust tip for my Nissan Armada and her 3 inch pipe. It looks great and was so easy to install. I'm pretty savvy at working on my vehciles, especially for a female, but this was so easy a cave woman could do it! It really accentuates the chrome trim on my truck and luckily doesn't make it too loud, which is illegal here in Cali. I think if you want it louder you can adjust where the tip sits on your exhaust pipe, and maybe have it sit a little farther forward to give it a louder sound. I tried that originally, then set it back farther which made it sound like it originally did before the tip. I don't need it to be loud, I have a 5.6L V8 and I know it, I don't need to make it louder than it already is. Plus, I don't want to get a ticket. But I DO want my exhaust tip to look sharp, and this definitely does that! I highly recommend this tip."
1,Cyndi Lauper is not here!!,"I bought this thinking Cyndi Lauper performed on some of the songs. Cyndi doesn't sing anything on this cd. However, the liner notes do have a note from Cyndi saying she wanted to be involved with the project but couldn't. If you're expecting to hear Cyndi, don't buy this cd."
5,The Recursive Universe: Cosmic Complexity and the Limits of,"A wonderful journey through key concepts in information theory using Conway's ""Life"" program as a vehicle. This book is a celebration of what is possible when natural law is applied to a random system, and demonstrates the necessity of limits on systems. Highly recommended for anyone interested in entropy, extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, or cellular automata. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
5,uses the game of life to illustrate timeless aspects of physics,"Although this book was written in the 80's it is still up to date as it covers timeless aspects of physics. The book alternates chapters on Conway's Game of Life with chapters on physics. There is a lot of clearly explained chapters on information theory including Maxwell's Demon and the solution to that paradox. Also there is information on what happened at the beginning of the universe and what will happen at the end of the universe. There is also a mini biography of Von Neumann which I found very interesting. Finally, there is a good bibliography of books some of which are still current. I have read several books on this kind of stuff but this is probably the clearest book I have read, especially the part on information theory."
3,Mainly about Life,"This book is about complexity and information theory. For this purpose it has a great deal with the now famous Conway's CA, Life, as an illustration. Though the survey of the main topic is pretty good--discussing such topics as Maxwell's demon, self-reproduction, self-organization, Von Neumann's automata &c--the; book turns out to focus primarily on Life, ending with a detailed explanation of how to make a computing machine and then a universal constructor out of the game. It's the book's major point.People seeking more Life documentation may want to inquire after Robert Wainwright, computer consultant for this book, who provided till recently (and certainly still does so) Lifenthusiasts with Lifeline, a letter recording many Life facts found out in its early history, and still of great importance nowadays."
1,Too Obscure for Me,"I got this book for my husband because he is reconsidering his religious faith and I thought it would be about agnosticism. It is, instead, a HIGHLY technical treatise about I don't know what, inaccessible to me (and I assume to my husband, though I sent it back before he even saw it). It made no sense to me at all. I don't know what kind of audience it's for--mathematicians? scientists of some sort? But not the lay reader, that's for sure. I would have wanted this to be made clear before I bought it."
4,A Strange Way For Me To Read My First Dennis Lynds,"Penned by the late, great Dennis Lynds ""Too Friendly, Too Dead"" is a nifty little pot-boiler about the 36 hours it takes Shayne to solve the murder of a seemingly innocent, overtly friendly, honest, family man/insurance salesman. Only when I discovered that Lynds ghost wrote the book, did the quality of the writing stop being a suprise. Short, well plotted, a little hard-boiled and quite early 60's ish. Nice suprise ending too. The question for me will be, how well will my second Shanye, which definitlely won't be written by the great Dennis Lynds, stand-up to this first suprise?"
1,I paid and waited two weeks for the wrong book,"I odered a school book for the first time with Amazon.com a few weeks ago. I needed a third edition of the book and that is what I suppossedly ordered,but instead I had to wait two weeks for the first edition which was very out of date and I was not able to be prepared for my class. Now I have had to resort to coping pages of the book from a classmate. I will never order a book from amazon.com again."
5,Best math games for computer,"This company makes great educational software. I only wish they covered more subjects. This is the only line of math software my daughter will play for enjoyment, and the only ""school"" software I don't have to force her to use. It works like a math book, first teaching the easy basics and working up to more lengthy problems. Children get to play little games in between lessons. ""Pages"" with wrong answers are marked red so children may go back and correct them. Just a really good design. For 3rd grade I also recommend buying their multiplication and division game, since this one does not cover those."
4,Good phone,"This phone was expensive for a 2.8 GHZ model, but if you want a Panasonic phone that wall mounts (flat against the wall), this model is the most cost effective way to go. Other Panasonics were clearly made for table-top use only, but this model actually adapts sits flat against the wall.The talking caller ID is nice, but if all of your calls are name-less ""Wireless Caller"" or ""Unknown name"" the phone won't alternatively say recite the caller's number, nor will it pick up on a stored nickname from speed-dial memory and recite that instead. All in all it is a good model."
3,review pan kx-tg2386b,"Not favorableI was lookingfor help in the hearing inpared areaThis phone does not address that area even thou its addvert.s make a claim to. The enhancened voice etc., etc. are no better then a stock SBC phone.Sorry I got 1.Bob"
4,A Gift,"I bought this book for my granddaughter. She is teaching a youth group, all girls. She wanted to share this with them, because, the book meant so much to her, when she was their age."
1,Is this book a joke?,"Tying sex with ""Satan"" may be one of the most evil messages ever sent. It leads to most of the psychological disorders that young men and women develop, generates a ""hedonistic"" backlash comparable to the War on Drugs and thwarts the intelligent use of contraceptives (which in turn leads to unwanted pregnancies and abortions).This book is so hopelessly puritanical and backwards that it just might resurrect The Taliban.Atrocious, close-minded and anti-Christian. An abomination of a book."
1,"Do as I say or burn, sinner, burn!","This book is one of the most atrocious books ever written. Dannah's preachy, holier-than-thou attitude is a tremendous turnoff except to those who are like-minded or being bent under the thumb of fundamentalist Christianty and Puritanism, which seems evident from the kidns of people who have been giving this monstrocity of a book 5 stars. The delights of sexual experience were given to us to enjoy, not to keep under lock and key for one guy who may or may not be good in bed or even worth staying in a marriage with. In addition, science has given us contraception, which allows women to choose how many children they have. This book undoes every last shred of the women's rights movement. I am not a promoter of promiscuity, but this book's only message is that we should feel guilty and dirty for even thinking of sex outside of marriage. It's books like this that remind me why I gave up Christianty many years ago."
1,What's next-chastity belts?,"This book is a reactionary effort to make women ""wait"" for sexual union or they'll be ""sinners"" and end up with Satan. Pleeeeease! More unsettling it is ""based on scriptures"" yet ignores recent findings (Dead Sea, Egypt)that indicate JESUS was married and not so ""pure"" (Our Bible was translated from Greek writings. FYI Jesus never ever spoke or wrote Greek.Our Biblical books were chosen based on politics, not truth. MAry wasn't a virgin either, read Thierring, et. al. and get real) Love is love is love. Orgasms are of the spirit, but let's get away from this ""purity"" garbage. There are too many horrible pure people, while some of the nicest people I knoww, AND the most like JESUS, have enjoyed sex without marriage. What's next, follow the husband barefoot and pregnant?"
5,Please read this book!!,"This book was such an amazing inspiration to me. I am married to a youth pastor so working with teenage girls is a way of life for me. I read this book in preparation for a ""Pure Freedom"" retreat in which I will be a mentor. After reading the book, all I can say is I can't wait to see God in action in those girls lives through this book!! What a down to earth, fun, and MAJORLY effective way Dannah has of ministering the truth about sex and purity to a generation of young women being constantly lied to about their value and sexuality. If you are a parent of pre or teenage daughters I would highly recommend that you read this book for yourself and then read it with your daughter because it is and awesome opportunity for you to come along side of her and help her grow into the woman of God she should be. I plan on using this book as a ten week bible study with the girls in my youth group and I can't wait!!"
5,Every young woman should read this book,"I received an email from Dannah personally about this book before it ever came out. I was completely impressed by all that I heard and couldn't wait to read the book. I was not dissapointed! I think every female from the age 13-25 should read this book. It is chock full of advice, tips, ideas, wisdom and reality! It feels like Dannah is talking to you personally through this book. And the love story between her husband and her that is woven throughout the book is amazing. This book is about being a godly woman and falling in love with our first love, God, more than anything else. Dannah's heart simply shines through and her message is so important. GET THIS BOOK!"
5,A Great and Practical Book,"I found this book at the Christian bookstore and was intrigued by the title. I didn't realize until after I bought it that it was intended for teenagers (I'm in my late 20s and single) But I'm not at all sorry I bought this book. The Lord has really been convincing me lately of the importance of being sexually pure. I was looking for a book that not only discussed purity but how to live it out. This book gives some great tips. I can't wait to try them out for myself. I wish I had had this information when I was a young teenager. It would have saved me a lot of grief, regret and heartache. But while no one can change the past, with God's help and the tips in this book. You can change the future. I appreciate the author's honest. Yes, she is married, but she is very much aware of the struggles that young single women face. I think this book should be required reading for every teenager and for every parent with teenage girls. I would definitely recommend this book to others."
3,Disappointing,"I have read most of what Warren Murphy has written, going back to the Destroyer #1, Trace and Digger Series. He has been one of my top all time favorite authors., but I have to say that I was very disappointed in Jericho Day. Both the story line, the style of writing and the quality is not what I have come to expect from him.It was a new twist on conspiracy theory. I read it to the end hoping it would get better, but it left me flat, and was not up to his standards."
1,Died Within Months,We purchased this drive just for backup purposes. It dies within 6 months of us using it. Don't waste your money.
1,Drive Died in Less Than a Year,"With moderate use, this drive died in less than a year. The speed is fair. Personally I will not buy Fantom drive again."
2,somewhat questionable reliability,"With over 2 years of medium usage (basically used to backup digital photos and media files), this drives shows signs of age - it is clicking and the computer loses connection to it (drive letter disappears) often, and the red LED stays on.I did rescue all data in time by moving it to another external disk before this unit gets into a bad state. After re-formating, it did not get any better. It keeps clicking for no obvious reason. I do not have any confidence to place any data on it, and am ready to declare it ""rest in peace""."
1,One of the most UNreliable products you can buy,"Like others, I purchased this drive and soon afterwards experienced numerous and disruptive failures. Not with sleep mode or the drive itself, but with its USB controller. It was a complete waste of money, not to mention the fact that Fantom never coughed up the [...] that helped convince me to buy this unit. You simply CANNOT rely on this drive. It is the last Fantom product I will ever purchase."
1,Died after less than 6 months,I had a power problem in my apartment and had to cycle the power a couple times.After that the drive was totally dead! I lost all my data!! Argh. It should be able to handle that.This is less than 6 months after I bought it.
1,Don't depend on this!,"This external hard drive is horrible. The hard drive loses data to the point where it isn't easily recoverable. I had to buy a hard drive restore program to pull the data off the drive sector by sector.I reformated and chkdsk'ed the drive, and tried again. After a few weeks, same thing, drive was all corrupted and unusable! AVOID THIS DRIVE AT ALL COSTS!Amazon should allow us to give this thing 0 stars."
3,OUR GENDER-PERSONALITIES ARE CULTURAL RATHER THAN BIOLOGICAL,"John Money & Anke A. EhrhardtMan & Woman, Boy & Girl(Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins UP, 1972) 311 pagesA strong argument that the differences we observebetween men and women are cultural rather than biological.Rather technical, but very thought-provoking.If you would like to know about other books on 'masculinity' and 'femininity',search the Internet for the following bibliography:""Best Books on Gender-Personality"".James Leonard Park, creator of the Gender-Pattern Chart."
2,The sound quality couldn't match the materials,"The material on this disc is as good as, if not better, other Milt Jackson CD. However, the recording is pretty old. The disc seem to be a straight transfer, making the disc sound like a bad recording from a old tape. If you are a hardcore M.J fan, you'll enjoy the disc. Otherwise, you may be better off with other MJ discs, such as ""Bag Groove"", or ""Bag Meet Wes""."
4,Tunnel is great,"If you like Tricycle you will like this album as well. The bass work of Flim Johnson is awesome as usual. Flim and the BB's maintain their light, lyrical quality on this work as well. You won't be disappointed."
4,"Not Real Love, But A Great Song","When George Michael does a ballad, he really knows how to make a song his own. That was definitely the case with his latest ballad, a duet with Muyta on This Is Not Real Love. The song is one of the three new tracks from George's Twenty Five Greatest Hits album. the song has a very hypnotic beat and delivers simplisticly from the heart. When I first heard this song, I was really blown away. I think this is one of George's best duets since his collaboration with Elton John on Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me back in 1991. I can't wait to hear more duets like this one that really do work well, and not sound cheap.Song: B+"
5,Hard to Define Words,"Wonderful storey. Seems as there has been sufficient written about that so I will add something new. I found the dialect a little hard to deal with at first and actually set the book aside for a while. But then I read _Buddha_Da_ by Anne Donovan and that seemed even harder so back to _At_Swim..._ where I eventually, with the help of another reader, made a vocabulary list of hard to define words:[...]"
5,another great cd,"Can't go wrong when you listen to Duster Bennett,you either like it or you don't,personally I like raw blues."
4,I found this book fascinating,"My children weren't as interested as I was when I read it aloud. He refers to so many things from history and weaves in other places and events and I think it was a bit over their heads, but the writing is wonderful and interesting and if you have some mental pegs to hang all his references on it is a great book"
5,Understanding the Triumph motorcycle in history.,"I have read just about every book the covers the history and detail of Triumph motorcycles, and this book is the best I have seen. When you consider the unique marketing of the US distributors and the American concept of what a great motorcycle should be this is a must read for anyone working on a Triumph in the US. Detailed, colorful, and well written, with plenty of reference photos it is the guide for the restorer or anyone seeking to understand the the role Triumph played in making this a nation of motorcycle riders."
5,Backcountry Banff,Easy to use. Descriptive. Helpful to know which hikes to take and the difficutly of each hike as well as the highlights associated with each.
5,Great Book and Great Games,"I bought this book for my brother-in-law who conducts games and doll exhibition each year in their showroom [...] located in Mysore, India to the public. He received great reviews about the exhibit from the visitors and also in National newspapersI also bought other books listed below* Asian Games: The Art of Contest* Favorite Board Games You Can Make and Play* The illustrated guide to world chess sets* The World of Games: Their Origins and History, How to Play Them, and How to Make Them* Games Magazine Big Book of Games II: 10 Great Years* Games Magazine Big Book of Games* The Games We Played: The Golden Age of Board & Table Games* Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations* Classic Woodturning Projects with Bonnie Klein: 12 Skill-Building Designs* Oxford History of Board Games* The Game Makers: The Story of Parker Brothers, from Tiddledy Winks to Trivial Pursuit* The Book of Classic Board Games* My First Amazing Game Board Book* The New Complete Hoyle Revised"
4,Hoyle rules the game,"Sure you've been there the fight over how to play a particular game, or better yet the boredom on a rainy day when you've played all the Old Maid you can stomach. Whether you are looking to end a game of poker without bloodshed or want new ways to use that deck of cards Hoyle is the answer. Before you while away another boring day get cracking and secure a copy of Hoyle's latest."
4,ANOTHER GOOD SHORT READ,"Another collection of short stories from around the surfing world. Good for those flat, swelless days which seem to spring up with monotonous regularity."
4,Bohm's Classic work that started a new dialog on reality,"Bohm treats the totality of existence as an unbroken whole. His implicate order conncept: that any independent element in our universe contains within it the sum of all elements, i.e the sum of all existence itself. He describes an enfolding-unfolding universe with consciousness playing a central role. He was a great thinker ahead of his time. This classic work captures a good cross section of his ideas."
2,High Hopes go belly up,I've heard detailed descriptions of Mr. Bohm's theory before ordering the book. At first....it was Very exciting to start delving into Mr. Bohm's incredible work.But halfway through the book....it was painfully obvious how poorly written this book is!!....Hard to follow..Shabby consistency....NOT friendly reading.I Still have the upmost respect for Mr. Bohm's theory of the implicate/explicate order...just wish this book was written clearly...could have been a facinating exploration.Instead...was a frustrating trip.Too bad....again....Much respect for Mr. Bohm....this book misses the mark though..
5,If you want to know why the universe exists read this book,If you've ever wondered why humans inhabit this world or why things happen the way they do then let Bohm do his thing. Humans don't inhabit this world humans habit-in this world. His view of the world as a hologram explains some of the phenomenons that other scietists can't explain. Read this book and take a whole new perspective on reality.
5,fine new thinking,"This book makes a good case for a dynamic view of existence. It might be considerred continuous creation. By the time I had seen this book first, years ago my intuitive sense had developed to receive these ideas well. I still had to take some time to turn my mind around for considerring the arguments on their own terms. I previously had learned principles of electronics and some technology. In my learning thus it seemed to follow that this is essentially correct."
2,somewhat interesting,"I bought this book to read about the nature of reality. The first half of the book was almost irrelevant, consisting of Bohm's ""be one with the universe"" philosophy, along with his tedious descriptions of the new words he has created, which have no real importance. The second half of the book was interesting, concerning general theories of the nature of reality. Overall, this book suffers from being repetitive and vague. There is a little bit of substance here - but stretched into a full length book that overextends itself."
3,Basic tutorials for Half-life 2 and Counterstrike,"Advance Level Design should say ""designed for counterstrike and Half-life 2"". I bought this DVD to learn Valve's Hammer editor for Left 4 Dead, since the editor is similar to Half-life 2. It provides enough to get you started, but ultimately I found better, more recent tutorials on Youtube or Valve's developer wiki. I'd like to see the author come out with a newer set of tutorials based on recent Hammer games. The audio is a little low at times, so be prepared to turn up the sound every now and then.Overall, its a good DVD for when there weren't the amount of resources available online today."
4,"A good, middle of the road, exposition. . .",". . .of the first six Minor Prophets written specifically for the teacher or preacher. While not an in-depth scholarly commentary (and this is not the purpose of the series) major issues and questions concerning the reading and interpretation of these books is well-presented.The professional student is probably going to wish to look elsewhere for more depth, but the pastor, looking for a preaching aid, or the adult Bible study facilitator will find the volume most rewarding.Recommended."
2,wallace neff and the grand houses of the golden state,"if you are looking for examples of the archictecture of wallace neff this is not the book to purchase. There are very few pictures of his architecture in this book, in fact the nicest picture in the book is the one on the front cover. The book is mostly about the man and what influenced his designs."
2,call me childish,"but I like photos. This book is dense. When we're talking architecture I want beautiful colorful photos! There are very few and often they are in black and white. If you're not looking for photos, it's fine."
5,The Best Game So Far,My Dad ordered tis game for me.Let me tell you this is the best RPG game I've ever played. It has really good graphics to.
5,been wearing it for a year or more,great barbell. its held up through the test of time. still looks like the day i got it. the thing i really like about this gemmed barbell is that the gem is not too jagged. often times you get a barbell with a gem in it and they want it to be cut to look a lot like a gem and if youre putting this in your TONGUE you really dont want a jagged barbell.this barbell however is not jagged and didnt cut the roof of my mouth like others in the past that i have had. its withheld its quality over time and Its a great purchase.
2,Card board stiff,"Stiff and inflexible, abrasive and uncomfortable. Covered by a highlyreflective glass bead? material that makes you easy to see at low light.Causes some flash flair if in the back ground of someone else's picture.Best use would be as a dog leash, and not on an expensive camera."
3,Not sure it's worth it,"I was attracted by the write-up - strong, safe, and so on.The strap is stiff and unwieldy. It doesn't fit well into my bags. And it's not particularly comfortable.So if you live, work, or shoot in an area where you're afraid that either someone is going to rip or cut your camera off your neck/shoulder, or that you're somehow going to lose it, this is for you."
2,"Stiff, uncomfortable, short","I bought this knowing it was a bit stiff from the reviews, but I didn't realize that it was going to be as bad as it was. The folds never straighten out and the straps just poke out as you bring the camera up to your face. The padding while comfortable is just too big even for me.The description and pictures were incorrect for my order as well. Three steel wires and it looked silver in the photos. Mine was black and had two steel wires running through it.Overall it was uncomfortable and does adjust to 50"" but I found this was insufficient for me to wear over my shoulder or across my chest. It's also just not long enough in the ""normal"" position for me, but I have a tall torso. This would be nice if it were maybe 60-65 inches.Other than that, if you want the peace of mind its nice and the version I received was attractive as it was mostly in a muted black look, but I was actually looking forward to the silver a little."
1,do not buy this book,"95% of it explains obvious and stupid things to not do, and you need a master+ in Mathematics to understand the 5% left of this book that i would have rated -5 stars if i had the opportunity to do so, save $15 and go play lottery instead you'll have more chances to win this way."
1,TRUE LOTTO PLAYERS WONT WANT THIS BOOK,THE BOOK STARTS OUT SAYING HOT NUMBERS/COLD/TRENDS/ETS. IS FOOLISH AND SILLY(PREFACE VIII )HE SAYS QUICK PICKS ARE SENSIBLE-THEN CONTRADICTS IT BY SAYING QUICK PICK MACHINES ARENT TRUE(PAGE70)SAYS PAST WINNINGS DONT MATTER IN PICKING NUMBERS(WE ALL KNOW SAME TICKETS DONT REPEAT IN PICK6)HE LOST ME WHEN TALKING ABOUT USING CARDS TO USE MARKED 1-S! HE USED TERMS LIKE ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY- AND I HAVE TO WANDER WHERE OR HOW ON EARTH THIS PERSON EVER WROTE A BOOK ON LOTTO-MY DOGS COULD HAVE DONE BETTER.IF YOU PLAY LOTTO AND WANT TIPS --STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK.
2,An average addition to the Photoshop manual,"Don't expect to pass the ACE [Adobe Certified Expert] exam with this book alone, unless you are a seasoned Photoshop guru. I studied this book cover to cover and memorized all the lessons in the back of each chapter, and I only passed the ACE exam by a handful of questions [I got a 78%]. Don't get me wrong, this book is an OK addition to the library as a supplement to the Photoshop 5.5 manual, but it is not as effective at teaching the more useful techniques. I prefer the ""Photoshop WOW! Book"" style - densely packed with nothing but page after page of useful tips, tricks, how-to's, and techiniques of the masters. This is not that book."
4,Solid,"If you are looking for solid, fundamental view of the Photoshop world, this is the must-have series. Especially those of you who would like to be an Adobe Certified Expert (ACE), this is the best guide book for you to buy.This isn't your magic book of photoshop for tricks and short cuts per say, rememeber, this is for pure fundamental learning purpose."
5,probably the best books ive ever read,"i really really recomend this book to anyone who wants to learn about adobe photoshop 5.5, and even if you dont want to learn about photoshop 5.5 i still recomend it for you. This book goes step by step by step on every bit of instruction to create the best looking graphics that are just out of this world. And don't even think about the price, because its well over worth it. I would probably even pay more for it (well maybe not) but the bottem line is....just get it!"
4,Great for Beginners! Look at FX books for more fun!,This book tought me a lot of how to use the palets and just all the features of Adobe 5.5 and Image ready 2.0. So I recommend this book to you if you haven't used Adobe 5.0 or 5.5 before so you get used to everything but once your done you'll want a good FX Adobe book so you can have some real fun that we all like doing.
4,It's NOT a reference manual. . .,"This book is designed to supplement a users knowledge in order to prepare them for the Adobe Certified Expert exam. In that capacity it excels. For a reference manual, I would recommend Adobe Photoshop 5 Studio Techniques (ISBN 1-56830-474-9) as this offers some usability tips not found in many reference tomes.I would also recommend browsing internet sites that offer photoshop tutorials. These can offer a great deal of free advice to advance your skills. MS"
5,Lands of Lore Vs Vista,"I just wanted to add some highlight on this game and how to make it work on your Windows Vista, don't worry LOL will work perfectly on your Vista and all you need here is an emulator called DOSBox since the game is only DOS based.In other words, DOSBox is an emulator that recreates a MS-DOS compatible environment (complete with Sound, Input, Graphics and even basic networking). This environment is complete enough to run many classic MS-DOS games completely unmodified.Furthermore I did experience a problem with DOSBox when you try to maximize the emulator to fit it to your screen everything will simply freeze so you will play it on a windowed mode unfortunately.[...]I hope this will answer many questions!"
5,I think this may be the REAL version.,"The REAL version of this CD has 11 tracks.Google searching shows this ASIN: B00008EUHN, as the 11 track version on amazon.ca among other places.This is the ASIN I purchased awhile back, and I received the 11 track version.Track 1 was ""O Fortuna (Apocalypse Chorus Mix"", and is one of the HUGE reasons for buying Rave til Dawn in the first place.That track doesn't show up on the amazon song listing. Either the ASIN is wrong, or the track listing is wrong.Watch out or you might not get what your expecting. You may want to contact the seller before you purchase."
2,Uneven Collection of Approaches to the Noir Literary Genre,"Granted, this isn't the kind of fiction I usually read. I prefer classic literature. But I was given this book by a friend because I love film noir and live in DC. It's a very uneven collection of stories. Some are well-written, a few are terrible, and most are mediocre. The most evident problems were cliche plot devices and characters, implausible character motivations, and a lack of insightful or meaningful themes. A few of the stories make good use of DC as a location, but many of them could have been located in any city. The best that I could say about this collection is that it afforded me an opportunity to explore a variety of writing styles and approaches to the noir literary genre."
2,Mediocre At Best,"A couple of good stories, a couple of mediocre stories, and the rest are not worth reading. Give this book a Pasadena."
2,Maybe it is just me.......,"but I found this book fairly ordinary. I liked a few of the stories but most seemed too short and didn't really grab me at all. George Pelecanos wrote the best story by far (not uncommon for him, one of the most talented writers out there).I am not a fan of short stories to begin with so maybe my preconceived notions of what to expect (disappointment) coloured my viewpoint."
5,A must have!,"This DVD collection proves why Elvis was and still is The King of Rock n' Roll! The way he performed was unbelievable, nothing compared to any other musical act of his time. He revolutionized the music and performing arts world! I bought this DVD to watch Elvis, however I love the fact that the collection includes the complete shows in which he appeared AND also those cool vintage tv commercials from the time! It made me feel like I was no longer in 2011 but the 1950's. Elvis' performances were the best out of all! I also want to add, that the quality of this set is superb. Definitely a must have for any music lover."
5,Elvis Presley-Ed Sullivan Shows,"We loved them! Two of our daughters were visiting from San Diego, ages 44 and 35, and they enjoyed the shows every bit as much as we did. What a surprise for all of us to see Carol Burnett do one of her first stand up routines. Our daughter Lacie said, ""She was even hilarious back then"", and of course we were all captivated by Elvis. Would suggest it to people of all ages."
4,Fun Shows,Enjoy seeing Elvis' appearance in the context of the entire shows. Didn't like or agree with the opinions expressed by the individual who wrote the notes on the caliber of the other entertainers.
2,Packaging too big...contents too small.,"Do we really need such a large set for just three episodes of Ed Sullivan? How about this...get ALL of Elvis 1950's TV appearances, and put them in one set. Forget the extra acts, just give us 100% Elvis.... compile all his appearances on Stage Show (Dorsey Brothers), Milton Berle, Steve Allen, and yes, Toast Of The Town with Ed Sullivan. Now THAT would be a great collection. Much more material, and it could probably fit in the same size packaging as this set."
3,Elvis Presley - Ed Sullivan showsd,This was a little disappointing. I was hoping for more variety and not just a continuation or repeat on each dvd.
5,"The ""Really Big"" Elvis Shows","Elvis Presley's 1956-57 appearances on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" remain legendary in the annals of television and cultural history. After wading through home-video excerpts, we finally have a DVD set with all three Elvis programs shown in their proper context. This includes Ed's vaudevillian potpourri (ranging from impressionist Will Jordan to a young Carol Burnett) and vintage Lincoln Mercury commercials. Nevertheless, it is Elvis who rocks the house whenever he takes the stage. By the final show, Presley assumes full command in his ""waist up"" performances of ""Don't Be Cruel,"" ""Too Much"" and a stirring ""Peace in the Valley."" However, pay close attention to the September 1956 broadcast, with Charles Laughton substituting for the injured Sullivan. The British actor proved a better host than ""Old Stone Face"" and treated Elvis with more respect: ""It has been many a year since any young performer has captured such a wide and, as we heard tonight, devoted audience."""
1,rating: dim bulb,"usually, ""reconditioned"" includes a functional product, with the dirt removed, having the parts screwed back together, and a box with directions - at the least- but that was too much to ask for here.For a lot less money, you can buy a bic lighter- and it will stay lit longer."
5,Just Amazing,"Before I really got into the Happy Hardcore music, I didn't really know anything of it, but then the one day I stumbled across a part of this album and fell in love with it. I personally love Hixxy's mix over the other two, but they are just as great.Vocally, Hixxy's mix has the most, followed by Scott Brown then Sharkey. Where the sound is concerned, this is a fantastic addition to the Bonkers collection."
5,Helpful exercises make this a valuable self-help book,The Woman's guide to Total Self Esteem is a wonderful book. There is a lot of information to help you understand how self-esteem works and why it's important. Then there are exercises that move you through the process of changing your thinking and feeling about yourself and your life. This book is very pro-woman and empowering. I love it!
2,Weak!,This book tries hard but it's way too short to really cover these topics. It's too dumbed down and simple. It doesn't have enough substance to really change you. I recommend Nathanial Brandon's Six Pillars.
1,A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME,"Alice Miller does it best. If you're looking for help with who you are, read her. This was a bunch of nonsense in 98 pages trying to cover the history of women, society and rife with stereotypes. Go read Alice."
5,The Camel's Lament,Great kids book. I love Charles Edwards Carral. His poems flow so nicely that it is fun to read. I still remember one of his poems that I memorized in the fifth grade.
5,Papaito's superb tribute to a legendary Cuban sonero.,"This CD is an absolute MUST for any fan of Cuban music. The late great but underrated and underexposed Afro-Cuban sonero Papaito pays a mind-blowing and truly superb tribute to the legendary Abelardo Barroso. ""En Guantanamo"", ""Suavecito"" and ""Bruca Manigua"" are masterpieces that shall forever remain timeless. No self-respecting fan of classic Cuban music should be without this CD."
3,Roger Chapman - 'He Was She Was You Was He Was' (Angel Air),"Decent compilation of Roger Chapman's repertoire. Chapman is probably best known for being the vocalist / frontman for Family. Even though this 14 live track 2-CD (several of you know what a live album nut I am)didn't exactly have me gasping for more, I had a decent time checking it out. Basically, it's just straight-ahead rock & roll, with a bit of a jazz element. Line-up: Roger Chapman - vocals, Geoff Whitehorn - guitar & vocals, Steve Simpson - guitar & mandolin, Poli Palmer - synthesizer,Tim Hinkley - piano, Nic Pentelow - sax,Boz Burell - bass and Stretch - drums. Comes with a 24-page booklet, jammed packed with liner notes. May appeal to fans of Streetwalkers, Bob Tench, the Groundhogs, Blodwyn Pig and possibly Traffic."
3,Revenge is sweet,"I think the most interesting aspect of this novel is the person who wrote it. Olivia Goldsmith went thru a messy divorce which prompted the writing of this and many other novels where women are treated badly by the men in their lives, the men leave and the women end up better off. In this case, revenge is sweet. Sadly, the novelist died in 2004 due to complications from plastic surgery. This novel was just OK for me. The plot was interesting, the characters were likeable enough but there was something missing. It just didn't go deep enough for me. At times the plot was choppy. The First Wives Club was formed when 3 New York Elites are dumped by their husbands and then seek revenge. I bet a lot of scorned women out there, who read this book, were caught up in the sweetness of revenge. This, I'm sure, was responsible for it's immense popularity. It probably wasn't for the literary talent."
4,I RAN OUT OF JELLY BEANS!!!,"While on vacation recently, I ""borrowed"" a copy of THE FIRSTWIVES CLUB and didn't quite finish it. I had to leave thecopy at my vacation spot before returning home. Now, I'manxious to finish it--I was definitely enjoying it!Admittedly, I throw nickels around like man-hole covers, soI tried to check the book out at my local library uponreturning home. I'm 22nd on the waiting list! So... if youhave this book, are willing to part with it, and you live inthe Kansas City area, please contact me and I might want tobuy it from you!Otherwise, I see that Amazon.Com has an excellent price, andI will pick up a copy there (well, I guess that would be""here"", wouldn't it?)."
3,Not your silver screen comedy,"The movie and the book are nothing alike. Don't pick up one expecting the other, because it's a serious case of I.N.O. In name only. The movie is a mostly light-hearted look at the bonds of friendship and sisterhood, glossing over the harder aspects of the plot like divorce and self. The book is a dark exploration of loneliness and abuse told through characters plagued by obsession, doubt, and substance abuse. This book comes with a trigger warning.It's an okay book. I didn't love it but I also couldn't put it down, whatever that means. The characters are well developed and the book is well written. If you're looking for something detailed and a little dark then go for it."
4,The First Wives Club,"I thought it started out slow and took a while to really get into the book. However, I thought the closing of the book was great."
3,Don't expect to read the movie,"It's different from the film, but then what book ever really successfully makes it to the big screen faithfully. However, the characters are still interesting enough to care about."
1,The movie is better.,"I listened to the audio copy of this book and it is too raunchy for my taste. Christine Baranski, who reads the book makes most of the characters sound like stuck up snobs, unlike what Bette, Goldie or Diane do in the movie.The movie, at least, gives the story humor and keeps the sex at a minimum."
2,Damn Airplane,"There I was, sitting on an airplane next to a guy with the worst body odor who insisted on trying to talk to me. I had already done the in-flight magazine crossword and the only thing that saved me from having to talk to the smelly man beside me was a copy of this horrible book a previous passenger must have rightfully left behind. Reading it was easier than pretending to read it so . . . I hate to admit it, but I finished it. If I hadn't been on an airplane I would have burned it, but as it was, some sadistic impulse forced me to leave this incredibly bad novel behind for the next poor sap to occupy my seat. The only reason I give it two stars is because the guy beside me got one."
1,"Filthy novel, poorly written","When I read this book several years ago, I had no idea what I was getting into. I had seen the movie, and although I didn't love it, the movie was ok, and a book is always supposed to be better than the movie. At first the book seemed merely very unlikely. Then as I continued reading I began to feel a little uncomfortable with certain characters. The one friend who was supposedly a compulsive eater sounded no different than me, and I am not even considered chubby. The one new girlfriend was disgusting, not only in what she did, but in how she lived her life. The only saving grace to the entire book was the general plot. Although very unbelievable, it was also very satisfying to see these men get what they deserved in life, but honestly the women did not deserve the satisfaction they experienced from the men's downfalls. Thank goodness I had just borrowed the book from the library and not bought it!"
5,I love my TNIV!,"I just purchased the TNIV (got the red one) and I LOVE it! This Bible is the perfect size - not too small, not too big, the font is easy on the eyes, it's light and easy to bring around, and I love the soft feel of the cover.The translation is wonderful! Much of the more dubious phraseology in the NIV has been updated so that it's more readily understandable (e.g. ""with child"" changed to ""pregnant"")... and unlike many opponents of the TNIV suggest, this translation is not ""gender-neutral"" as much as it is ""gender-inclusive."" I love that it is CLEAR that I (as a woman & daughter of God) am included in the commands, exhortations and promises of God. :) I thought I would never make the switch from my beloved NIV (from which I had memorized over a hundred Scripture verses), but the Strauss vs. Grudem debate tipped me over to ""the other side"" -- i.e. the TNIV. It has been a good change -- refreshing and enlivening for my Spiritual journey. Thank you, TNIV translators!!!! =)"
1,did they really kill a tree to print this drivel,"this book is utterly worthless. It isn't even amusing, which such a book could easily be.Filled with such mind-shattering advice as: 1. You can either call, write, or apologize immediatley (duh, what did she want, via telepathy?) 2. You should watch out around whom you're speaking,and lots of other things that the typical 4 year old knows better than to do."
1,I wouldnt pay $40 for this $125 unit,It took 5 weeks for UmeVoice to send this to me. It took me one day to send it back. It's not worth half its price.
2,Waaay too much for too little,"It's fragile and takes too long to get on and adjusted. The sound is okay, but not great. $150!?!?!?! You can get three mics of equal quality for that. Caveat emptor."
1,So where are they all now..,"Having bought this book about a year or so ago, I just picked it up from the bookshelf and had a look at the current URLs of the examples provided. Given the rate of change of the web you would expect many of these example sites to be different - I found that many were no longer there - and those that were have changed their style radically. Hmmm. Not a good advert for the book!"
5,An interesting book,"This is one of three of Anthony Englin's books that I have read, it was an enjoyable book to read with plenty of things going on to keep the plot going plus being a gardener I tend to find the garden mysteries interesting-if you like mysteries of this kind you should enjoy this book."
5,Born to Love You,"This, as one of the most original of the ""firsts"" produced by this combo, is an extraordinarily clean recording, as others have said here. But that's only a small part of what this is all about...This group tried to maximize the range of a new recording medium with the compositions they created and performed. And perhaps the greatest of all examples of this is the track, ""Born to Love You.""Digital recording, as a development beyond analog technology, meant extraordinary dynamic range. ""Born to Love You"" is one of the most startling recordings I've ever heard. It begins with a very quiet piano solo by Billy Barber, and gradually adds non-electronic instrumentation, most hauntingly a flute solo. This gradually builds to an incredible climax - and that word fits better than any other I can think of.Where are they now? Nobody in the 1990s made more innovative storytelling music like these guys did..."
4,Cool Techno Jazz,"If you ever want to test your new stereo with a pure digital experience, this is the CD for you. Technically, it has a great frequency range and is very ""thick"" (unlike most techno music). It is also the only good use of the orginal Kurzweil I have ever heard (and I have heard a lot). Musically, Flim and the boys are obviously having a lot of fun. It is very creative and has some great brass."
5,Lives up to its title!,"The CD trycicle is ground breaking indeed. I could not pass up the chance to share my thoughts on this CD. The same amazing digital trickery is here. The opening track is soft initally and , again as in the other CDS, spans the entire spectrum. The keyboards go extremely low to extremely high. I might add, this CD goes beyond the previous efforts. The dynamic range of loud to soft is used, again, beautifully. However, the melodies and phrasing of the tracks is quite enjoyable. I have recently revisited my Flim and the BBs collection and have been stuck on this CD again.Don't get me wrong, their are some great digital recordings of fusion jazz. This is the gold standard for sound quality. There is no background noise, you can hear everything going on, and, most importantly-expect the unexpected."
2,Reinforcement,This book just reinforced what I was already doing. The only thing that really sparked my interest was to include my child in more of the household activities even though he is young. The main advice is to ignore the whinging which I do but after 40 minutes of ignoring what are you to do next?? It didn't have the answers I needed.
5,This book really works!,The key to helping your children learn to not whine is to change your own behaviour towards them. Model respectful behaviour. Loved this book!
3,Don't let the cover fool you!,"Despite the picture of a 2-3 year old child on the cover, this book has very few examples of how to deal with Toddlers. Virtually all of the advice and examples deal with school age children (6 yrs+).The other problem for me was that the book is more focused on getting your child to stop whining and having tantrums about things THEY WANT. It has virtually no advice for getting children to do things YOU NEED them to do (take medicine, let you change a diaper, etc.)-- these were the areas where I was having the most trouble.Don't get me wrong - this would be a great book for parents of older children. Some of the advice is usable for toddlers, but this book would have benefited from a section devoted to little ones who do not understand ""I felt.. when you.."" conversation. I was hoping to get a head start with my toddler so I wouldn't need a book like this when she was older. I didn't really find the advice here."
2,Of minimal help. . .,"Most of the examples and ideas in the book pertain to older children -- but it's the younger ones who whine! The idea of ignoring a whining child really doesn't stop a preschooler from whining - they'll just follow you out of the room! I didn't find a lot of specific answers that I was hoping for. If you want a book with more specific and realistic ideas check out this one: Kid Cooperation: How to Stop Yelling, Nagging and Pleading. I found it to have many practical solutions to whining and more."
5,Really good Ideas,"I really loved this book and my boys ages 2.5 and just turned 4 have really turned around. My 4 year old was so whiny I got the book for him, but it worked even better at taming the tantrums of my two year old that I had chalked up to ""normal"" 2year old behavior. The most important element, the one I was missing is the element of contribution. They are doing chores, and helping out and really enjoying it. Dinner time is a delight now. They behave and sit until they are done and then clear their plates. It has only been a few weeks and I was amazed immediately."
5,Short and to the point Book. Great Read,"I have a 2 year old and this book was great. We are just now dealing with trantrums and a constant whiny voice. I love that it is a short book and tells you point by point examples and situations. It also gives examples on how to use the techniques on older shildren. It is a great find! (Techniques work on whining and complaining husbands as well! LOL) I noticed results right way with my toddler. she now stops in the middle of her whin and ""talks"" her sentence out. Big step for a little [one]!"
5,Joey the Passion,"THIS GAME IS SWEET.PROS:YOU DUEL JOEYSMARTER CPUCHANGES DECK OCCASIONALLYLAN BASED CONNECTION(YEAH, I SAID LAN)COMES WITH RED-EYES BLACK DRAGON 2400/2000SEBEK'S BLESSINGSWORD OF DRAGON'S SOULCAN TRANSFER CARDS FROM YUGI THE DESTINY AND KAIBA THE REVENGE TO JOEY THE PASSION750 CARDS WITH ALL 3 GAMESFORBIDDEN LISTTONS OF CARDSCONS:JOEY SAYS HA HA HA HA HAHE SAYS SOMETIMES WHEN YOU LOSE:I DIDN'T WIN BECAUSE I AM A CHAMPION, I WON BECAUSE YOU STINK.(SADLY ENOUGH HE REALLY SAYS THAT)DOESN'T INLCUDE INTERNET CONNECTION.YOU CAN DOWNLOAD JUNO OR NET ZERO ATwww.netzero.comwww.juno.comNO MATTER WHAT GET JOEY THE PASSION. BUY THIS GAME, OR DIE!!! ITS THAT GOOD."
4,A Good YGO game,"Joey the Passion is the 3rd installment in the Power of Chaos games. It has over 700 cards, including the cards in the previous games. Although you can only play against one person (Joey Wheeler), it is a very good game. One thing I don't get is this: why is Joey made the last person to go against? You'd think it would be Yugi as the last person, but oh well. In this game, you can play online against others. Also, if you play the actual TCG, the promos will be a bonus goodie, or at least the magic-arm shield trap card.Overall, I would give it a 4/5 for internet playability, 700+ cards, okay promos. The only bad thing is that you only go against Joey, which isn't very bad, since he changes his deck when you do."
5,Wonderful devotional book for Christmas,This is a great book to use as a personal or family devotional during the advent or Christmas season. The author uses illustrations from his own family life to show the wonder of the Christ child. We celebrate Christmas every year and sometimes the story gets so cliched that we miss the wonder. Jeff DeVries helps us renew our amazement at the birth of Christ.
2,not described well,these are heavy duty extra wide wiper refills. they will not fit in a standard car wiper blade. this information should have been part of the description. and now i have to return them.
3,it's okay,tried this on a cruise and it was nice thought I'd use it at home after my shower to mositurise my skin still needed lotion
2,It Didn't Work,"This product was not able to make VCDs that could be shown either on my computer or on any DVD player we tried.Taking the advice of another reviewer, I bought MVP (see my review) and was able to make a good VCD in about a half-hour.I would not buy this product."
5,Great software for burning Cd's,"LOVE THIS PRODUCT.I HAVE MADE OVER 50 CD'S WITHOUT MAKING ONE COASTER.I HIGHLY recommend CLICK N BURN PRO. I tried roxio,adaptec before click and burn pro and had nothing but buffer underruns."
4,Click 'n Burn Pro and 24x Burners,"When I first started using Click 'n Burn Pro I was running a 16X max HP cd-cdrw and the program was great. I never had any problems with underrun or any other burn errors. With the easy user interface creating a cd of any type was very simple. Then one day by burner goes bad and will not recognize any blank disks so I purchased the new Sony 24x max burner. Once the HW was installed I tried to burn a disk and the software would not recognize the drive, hence the only problem I have with the software. So far there is not an upgrade to solve this issue. So beware if your HW is to new the software will not work. As soon as they get an upgrade I would suggest using no other program but Stomp's Click 'n Burn Pro. It has all the features a new user will need plus the advanced components a user will need as they get better at burning disks."
5,I'm in Burner Heaven,"After several years of struggling with the Adaptec now Roxio Easy CD Package, I thought that burning a CD required a combination of a few novenas, a blend of voodoo and finally divine intervention. This product changed all that. It is easy to use, maximizes the capability of your burner and executes flawlessly. I'm running Windows 2000 on a Dell 450 P3. I've got an HP 8100i burner. I''ve burned about 35 CD's so far with a blend of music, text and voice and have not had a single problem. The interface is easy and self explanatory. They should make this product standard issue with every CD burner. It would be a boost to burner sales."
1,Body Transformation,There was so little information in this book that I could not believe the hype it was getting.Save your money!
5,No Electronics,"Here, Billy Barber uses the full range of electronic recording capability enirely in partnership with acoustic piano. The results are startling.""Piano"" means ""soft."" It's a contraction for ""Pianoforte,"" meaning ""softloud."" And digital recording is ideal for the piano in a studio.Barber's playing has been better elsewhere - my favorite recording story is his inversions of ""Happy Birthday."" As we learn in the liner notes, he did this as a series of tonal inversions of the traditional song in order to thrill his mother for her birthday. How long would it take her to identify the simply little song he was playing?When I think of my deceased mother, I imagine myself playing that for her and wondering how long it would take before she recognized the tune...happy birthday, mom."
2,OK..but not a great learning tool,"I bought this Video set based on the glowing reviews found here at Amazon. when I received the video which I bought for my Spanish speaking wife, I was disappointed at the presentation.I think the video is better suited for children and not adults.My wife also did not like the presentation and pace of the video, she tought it was boring and un-interesting. The USState Department Rosetta Stone software is much better andyou get a lot more even though it costs more. I would not buythis for anyone, but maybe it will work for some."
4,The sweetness and the pride,the compasion between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet is so beautiful and cute. How he really loved her but did not dare to show it in the begining at the dance and the rest is even better i would recomend this book to anybody in a second.READ THIS YOU'LL LOVE IT!
3,"Generally good, but editing has occurred without notification","The chapter that contains Washington's Farewell is missing about 50% of the content. Many paragraphs were edited out, without the reader being aware of it. Makes me wonder what else is missing that I haven't noticed."
3,Good and Bad,A useful guide for those undertaking a general undergrad physiology course but tainted by unnecessarily wordy explanations and horrible inaccuracies.
2,The Class,I was not as happy as I thought I would be. It is poor quality and the sound is bad. I expected something different I guess.
5,Puppet Master 2 Was The Best!!!!,I saw this movie a couple of times and I liked it. I thought it was so interesting than a bunch of other movies. I would like to own it someday so I could keep watching it over and over again.
5,EXCELLENT!,"This book is extremely insightful and thought-provoking. You can tell that a lot of prayer, time and research went into its development. No matter how many years you are into youth ministry, this book will be a great blessing!Señor Johnson"
4,Bobby's Fania era.,"I will have to agree with Justo on his review. Although the compilation has a good array of Bobby's songs when was with Fania, there are several songs that are not that good, specially one of his earliest albums Bad Breath. You are better off buying his albums separately, they were huge hits and excellent work in my opinion. Overall, the album is pretty good although it's missing ""Hay Craneo"" sung by Marvin Santiago. Don't know how they could of left that one out."
5,"If you have kids, you owe it to them use this book!","I've given this book to at least 30 clients who have kids. I'm a financial planner and am a big believer in helping my clients teach their children how to carry on what they are building. The exercises are SO simple and take almost NO time, but will make a HUGE impact on your kids relationship with money and may even affect yours a little!If your kids are 4 and up, this book is for you. It breaks down the ""What to do's"" in age specific exercises and at first glance you may think, ""that's it?"", but watching your kids develop a healthy relationship around money will be worth it's weight in diamonds!"
3,Pretty Good For A Movie Nobody's Heard Of!!!!,"The Kindred is not the greatest horror movie ever but it's certainly not a bad one either.Rod Steiger(Dr. Phillip Lloyd) and Kim Hunter(Dr. Amanda Hollins) star in a movie about a genetic experiment gone completely wrong. Dr. Hollins is a molecular biologist, who in poor health, confides in her son John to destroy all of her experiments and ""The Anthony"" journals. John wants to know who Anthony is and is told that it's his brother. Anthony is a half-human/sea creature that lives in the basement and was created by Dr. Hollins from her natural son's living tissue.The movie starts out a bit slow but picks up the pace through the middle and has a good climax. The acting isn't the best but the story is interesting and there are some pretty good scenes. All and all The Kindred isn't bad but I'd rent it before you buy it."
2,I had no clue I was buying a used book.,I thought when I clicked add to basket as I do with any purchase that I was purchasing a new book. I meant it did not say available from these sellers and then I pick a seller I want to purchase from. Anyway I got the book in a timely mannner but was shocked when I opened the box and saw a pretty worn book. Great book though with lots of info on eliminating / lessening the look of cellulite.
1,Expensive!,I haven't bought this book because it's $80.00!! Why is a paperback book of less than 300 pages 80 bucks?!
3,They are solid,"I like these pads and they are solid, the only complaint that I have is that when I hold the pads for my partner and the workout is over the straps that wrap around your forearm scrape against my forearm. When the workout is over my arms are marked up, now that is not really a big deal but that is the only downside to these pads that I have found"
2,Pay a little more and invest in quality kick pads,"I've been training Muay Thai for about 4 months now. The pads are beginning to rip at the sides. I understand that the impact of the kicks will punish the pads quite a bit, but, I don't see these pads lasting for more than a year. I would recommend investing another 40-50 bucks for some quality leather pads."
5,A great book,I read both Chinese version and English version. The trip to China is a very interesting story. Although there were a lot of stories left over.
2,Defective Coasters - Excellent Customer Service,"The set of four coasters I received did not match the style of sandstone background displayed in the picture. The stone was more of a speckled brown and gray color. Also, one coaster had a chip off the side and the last coaster in the set had some of the paint rubbed off. I called and received excellent customer service. They sent me a new set for free! Unfortunately, that set had two defective coasters. Again I received one with a chip on the side and the last coaster in this set also had some paint rubbed off the OU printing. Even more, the sandstone on the background did match the style displayed in the on-line graphic. Thus, I still don't have a set of four matching coasters that are not defective.As a result, the coasters are nice if you plan to use them for personal user, but not good for gifts."
4,lovely.,"sweet in the best sense, sometimes sexy, and especially good of you like French, but not necessary to enjoy this CD. Only minus is that the range is somewhat narrow."
4,Very promising debut,"Based on this album, Carla Bruni will have no trouble making the transition from catwalk to recording studio. Very dramatically better than most 1st-time LPs you'll hear, this record bodes well for Bruni's future, and for her audience. Most of the tracks are in French, one in CB's native Italian -- all sung with total conviction, expressiveness, and individuality. This is a serious record--don't hesitate!"
5,I still listen to this after over a year!,I discovered Carla Bruni's all French album for over a year now and I still enjoy listening to it. I happened to have one of the tracks off of her album from a sampler I received from Naive called Tout Le Monde and it's so good! She has the most amazing voice!! Because that song is so good I had to get the entire album. It's so great to hear Carla's voice periodically in the background when you are having a stressful day. If you don't know anything about Carla Bruni she is the famous supermodel from Italy.
4,i guess you are missing the point,"Every review says the same: she is hot and she sings. Ok, thats right, and thats great. but there are more things. she has a beautiful voice and its great listening to her. i know there are better things in life and she isnt the best singer in human history. but shes great, and i guess thats enough."
3,good effort,"This cd has some nice tunes, and Carla has a sexy, come-hither voice, making for a seductive album. But ultimately her songs all tend to sound mostly the same, and the monotone of her voice and style can tend to annoy."
1,Ok Singer,"I listen to a whole lot of French albums from many talented French artists. I'm not sure how i came across Carla Bruni. I listened to her album, and personally, i didn't get anything out of this. She has a lovely voice, but it's nothing special, and sometimes I felt that it gets bland after the first few songs. And the music itself is just too dull. Don't assume that jazz is not my taste, i love jazz/blues music, but this to me was just dull for the most part."
5,help...need a translation!,"i just received her cd today and i just love love love it...she has such a beautiful voice. i dont speak any french, so if anyone knows of where i can find an english translation of any of her lyrics...please tell me! thanks."
4,Blue and white collars fit the same,"While reading through this work I found that although the author was lifting 154 pound bags of coffee beans on a daily basis isn't all that dissimilar that being a cube dweller. The fact is that sitting in front of a computer in your cube messing with spreadsheets all day long contains many of the same mental drudges but doesn't affor some of the opportunities for the ""on and off"" time that the author descirbes in his manual labor work.Though I am unable to verify his statistics I was still astonished at the number of so called ""white collar"" workers that applied for jobs in San Francisco when the Stevedores Union opened up their hiring a few years ago.Interesting thoughts and concepts abound, but I found remarkably similar parallels between ""cube Jockeys"" and the manual labor workers the author is so familiar with. Certainly worth the read.Steve in Austin, Tx."
4,If you liked this!,"This book is a sleeper; an old clunker that sags in the middle, wheezes and farts at the stop-light and then lays two-hundred feet of rubber as it takes off!If you like this as much as I, try ""RIVETHEAD"" by Ben Hamper."
2,lots of belly aching,"The writer begins with a great premise concerning work, which few members of the work force consider. He proceeds to spend the last half of the book bitching. So, ...just read the first half <G>!"
2,Dell Axim X50V,"Upon registering this device, Dell support page informed me that my warranty had expired 7/9/2007. I received the ""new"" device on 11/1/2010, so no help there. The unit would not recognize the SD card (standard class 4, 4 gig SDHC) I do not know how long the battery lasts, as I never had a chance to use it, but it came with two batteries, so at least the company thought about it. There seems to be no way to move all my information from my PC to this device. The users manual (on CD) is a joke. I would not buy this item ( I have sent mine back) nor would I advise anyone else to."
1,The Dell Axim is not reliable!,"I've had two Dells Axim x50v. I bought the first in August 2005, the second one in July 2006 after the first one didn't work any more. They are very elegant, well designed but they are weakened by their specific graphics processor which is not reliable at all! Both Axims have broken down because of their graphics processor. Now I am using an HP iPaq!"
3,Dell is a great device if it works!,"I have had my dell axim for several years now, this is a great product for multimedia purposes. You can download many programs and have music,movies,GPS navigation(need reciever), and much much more with this device. I need to mention that dell pda's has several problems with the software and hardware. There are web sites out there to help buyers with various problems from this device. I had to replace my initial Dell axim x50v because of a digitizer problem. My screen would not align and my stylus was never acurate, but after getting a replacment, I have yet to run into any major problems. I recommend having some type of warranty with this product since it has a reputation of so many problems if you are going to purchase this."
4,"A relaxed, unstuffed-shirt approach to classical guitar.","This is a wonderfully reassuring book. I won't say it leads to ""effortless"" playing, as the cover boasts, but it certainly broadens the routine of practicing.BTW, this book was reprinted in 1991 by The Bold Strummer, Ltd., of Westport, Connecticut. It was listed in Books in Print in 1995."
3,"Trans-Siberian Handbook, Bryn Thomas","A brilliant book if you are travelling from Moscow to Beijing, but we travelled the other direction and found it a bit confusing as we had to read it backwards! Perfect if you are an independant traveller as there was so much information on places along the way, and also on cities that you might be starting your journey on. It helped us find a good tour company that we eventually booked our trip through - who also gave us a massive pack of information which we found easier to use."
3,"Book is fine, but seems dated","I guess that I'll be better to give a review after I have gone on my trip, but the book seems like it needs to be updated and perhaps better organized."
4,Yet to be put to the test,I am leaving soon for a two-week trip in Siberia. This book has been an exceellent primer. I'll know more about how to judge it when I return.
5,Paul Campos uses sound reasoning.,"I look forward to Paul Campos' articles more than any others. He scores the most points when he addresses the topics of academia, jurispridence and football. As an attorney with a belief that the system does work, I am hesitant to agree with assertions that American law is ""madness."" He draws me in with his arguments, however, and in my determination to refute them I sometimes fall short, and have to say Campos is often right. He plays an important role when he shines the spotlight on the system I admire so much. He's worth reading. He's challenging and has the courage of his convictions to keep the profession honest."
2,Too big promise,"If I had known beforehand, that Mr. Campos is an abortion-forbidder, I would not have read the book at all.But he comes out on that topic only in the last pages.And while small doubts on the War on Drugs are not as timid written by a law professor as would by anyone sharing experience with the ""health"" system, putting psychiatric diagnoses (obsessive-compulsive disorder)to anyone who desires justice but gets a verdict in (not only American) legal system, is contempt for people - I do admit to the unfulfilled desire for justice!!!Even if each point of criticism of the American legal system is perfectly true, the reader is left with a feel that Mr. Catholic is loathing the use of reason and discourse in legislation. What else?The legal system of the crusaders, inquisitors and witchburners?"
1,Boy was this book bad!,"To be honest, I couldn't get through it. It was that BAD! The arguements in this book were so poorly thought out that the reader is left with no idea of what the hell was going on. Buy this book only if you have money to waiste and you can't find anyone else to give it to."
5,first-class documentation and analysis on difficult subject,"Prof. Suster's book is a well documented and highly sophisticated work on history combining first-hand information, clear presentation and reliable analysis on many until now partially or wrongly interpreted historical phenomenons from troublesome Balkan history. Comprehensive in its analysis, the book is based on new historical literture and balanced in its historical judgments. Both biographies and historical analysis are based on scholarly literature from West and from local historiography. The emphesis is, as expected on contemporary history, covering all important facts of the last decade, but the most important historical phenomenons are, some for the first time in English,presented without any prejudice. In all respects this book will be an essential guide for everyone, from university professors and students to general public, tending to learn more on history and politics in Serbia, Montenegro and their neighbors."
3,All the features...except good sound,"I really wanted this to be the one, but the sound and material quality is poor. I returned this and bought the Danelectro Honey Tone for about $20, it has much better sound quality. They have all the features right but the sound quality, (poor tone, and effects are noisy/buzzy) and material quality is poor. Cheap plastic case, poor battery door, poor printing on the case. Hope they improve it, it is a great product idea, and made in the USA, but where's the quality, especially for this high price? If it was $30 I wouldn't be complaining, well, OK, the Honey Tone still sounds better, so I guess I would. Just my 2-Cents worth, try it your self!"
3,Bought this for travel,"I purchased the V2 so that I could use it while traveling. It's very small and offers a lot of nice features. I like that it has a tuner and metronome built in.The headphones are extremely cheap and can be thrown out and replaced with your favorite pair. What stands out most with this unit is the very poor build quality. I'm constantly worried about breaking it because it seems so delicate.I like the Danelectro HoneyTone better for sound, but for features and portability, the V2 is better, even though it's overpriced."
2,"Great, till it breaks.","I bought this as an option to get stereo in from a cd or ipod, to play along with my guitar. It is great for that, and I think it sounds great. But keep in mind, it is not made well. There is a typo on it for ""filter"" a friend of mine caught, and the input output labels are reversed. From day one, I couldn't get the battery cover to close without the chance of breaking the unit(I now just leave it off), and it has since developed a really high pitched squeal. It did what I wanted it to when I got it, but don't expect it to last forever."
5,Can't Stop Rockin',I can't stand how awsome this little amp is. It sounds great has a lot of great choices and is perfect for when I want to play and can't take my whole set up. This was a great purchase.
2,"Sorry, boring.","I like the idea of feminism in 1405, but I really couldn't fall in love with all the stories in this book. If you must read it in college, I'd suggest starting early because you will sure fall asleep reading this one. Out of all the books I've read for college, I'd say this is one of the worst in regards to ""keeping my interest."" I know it should of...it just didn't."
5,Good introduction to writing,"This book is most useful for students with no exposure to the Chinese writing system. After a clear and thorough introduction to the history and development of Chinese characters, students are introduced to 100 basic characters - a nice attainable number for the first year of high school instruction or the first semester at the university level. Each entry includes several example compounds (very important for Chinese, in which disparate characters can be combined discretely to form unexpected words) as well as nice, large boxes for practicing. While the Matthews have made a nice introduction to Chinese characters, more serious students of the language will outgrow it quite quickly. Their newer bookTuttle Learning Chinese Characters Volume 1: A Revolutionary New Way to Learn and Remember the 800 Most Basic Chinese Charactersprovides several hundred more characters (without the practice space) for the more ambitious.Nathan Dummittauthor ofChinese Through Tone & Color"
3,"Not enough characters, basically a drawing pad!","I would really highly recommend Tuttle's Learning Chinese Characters instead of this book. This book covers 100 characters, compared with ""Learning Chinese Characters"", which teacher 800 characters. ""Learning Chinese Characters"" also uses quirky stories to help you remember composite characters and drawings to help you remember basic building blocks. This book ""First 100 Chinese Characters"" has great information about writing the characters, but that information is almost entirely also available in ""Learning Chinese Characters"", and when you open this book, you'll see that ""First 100 Characters"" is about 15% information and the rest of every page is just room for you to the practice the characters, which you could obviously do in a separate notebook if you choose to use the information-packed ""Learning Chinese Characters""Tuttle Learning Chinese Characters Volume 1: A Revolutionary New Way to Learn and Remember the 800 Most Basic Chinese Characters"
4,Funky n' Chunky,"Amazingly low price paid for this watch! On opening the watch, I was surprised at the size of it. It's the Triumph Rocket 3 of the motorcycle watch world!It is huge. Very impressive. But feels quite light on the wrist. Very good quality, nicely finished, and with an elegant analogue face interspersed by an informative and esay to read digital display.It's not subtle. It's macho, and not to everybody's taste. But it reminds me of the Triumph slogan - ""Go your own way"".Recommended for real bikers."
3,If you think this is the best you haven't read many,This book was OK if you like hearing what people think about the after life and stuff like that. I don't prefer it but mabey you would. It wasn't a page-turner untill the last two or three chapters. If you can't force your self to keep reading you'll never make it to the good parts.
1,Remember me-Snoozer,"Horrible. didn't even finish it. got to the point where she was pushed from the balcony and already knew who did it and why, read the last chapter to confirm i was right. there was nothing really to draw you in. shari thinks like a 15 year old boy. I had a horrible time staying awake. I would recommend this Waste of money to two types of people Insomniacs (Half a chapter and you will be out like a light!) and to all new Authors (to learn what not to do do as a writer)"
3,Good book but a little too preachy for my tastes,"I enjoyed Remember Me but not nearly as much as I have the Thirst books by C. Pike. He goes into the new age/eastern religions with his character Sita but with Thirst it added to her character development and the progression of the story in so many ways. In Remember Me, it seems a little forced. Nonetheless, I will be reading Pike again. He is definitely an intriguing new voice (at least for me) in this genre."
5,One of my all time favourites!,"This book is so great it's one of my all time favourites now! As a paranormal fantasy novel for young adults, I'd recommend it for any age, it's exceptionally good reading.The story of Shari Cooper after her death is exceptionally well written, you are drawn into the story because it's unique and because the characters are interesting and very real. Along with suspense and paranormal mystery, this novel is also darkly funny at times, and takes you on a journey with Shari as she explores life after death.I can't recommend this novel enough, whether you like horror novels or not, you'll still love this story. It's not terrifying it's haunting and a delightful dark fantasy. A must read for teenagers and adults who enjoy dark fantasy and teenage fantasy/horror."
5,I couldn't stop reading,"I read this book fifteen years ago when I was 13 years old. I couldn't stop reading it. I loved it so much that I read it too many times to remember. ""Remember Me"" was the first Christopher Pike book that I read, and I immediately became hooked on his work. I ended up reading most of his books, and this is the best one."
3,duflops review,Remember Me is an awesome suspense and murder story. i really enjoyed reading the book by Christopher Pike. I insist on every outgoing person to experience Remember me .
4,PyRo'S Remember Me Review,This story is about a girl named Shari Cooper.Her spirit is looking for her killer.This way other people wouldn't have to die in the hands of the killer.She must now spy on her friends to find out any clues about the killer.The littlest things matter in this story.Now she will get revenge on her killer.
5,Wonderful!,"I like Pike's books, but this is one of my ultimate favorites. The main characters are wonderful, and the secondary storyline of the realtionship is wonderful."
3,Jen's Review,IT was a good book and ?I would recommend it to anyonem I think it had good hooks and a great plot to it. I would recommend it to anyone that likes these kinda stories such as fictions. They give me chills.
4,Pike at his peak,"This is far and away Pike's best teen novel IMHO, full of the mysticism tinged with melancholy that sets him apart from other young adult novelists. For the record, the sequels are completely forgettable--this is all the ""Remember Me"" you'll need."
5,I loved it!!!!!!!!!!,"This is such a great book, but of course it would be because Christopher Pike is such a great author! You will not be able to put this book down. You'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time you're reading it. And you'll be surprised at the outcome of the story and who the real killer was."
5,A beautiful book with surprises around every corner,Remember Me was a wonderful book. I just couldn't put it down. I read it twice. I felt like it was beautiful.The end was such a suprise I would have never gueesed it. I told all my friends to read it
5,A classic,"This book was a whole new experience to me, usually, in horror books, u only hear about the person dying, then they're gone. this book helped me to explore the ""other side"" of things. i liked it how it explained everything, and still let u find the murderer. altho, the third in the series, i found a bit dull..."
5,A GREAT BOOK!,"I loved this book. It was the first Christopher Pike book I ever read & after reading it I wanted to read anything & everything he's ever written. Although all of his books are good, I thought that this was the best one. It has a totally unique plot & a great ending. I definitely suggest that you read this book."
5,A Lovely Story,Remember Me 1 is one of the best book that's written by Christopher Pike. I love how the story goes. It really touches me. But I would not recommend you to read Remember Me 2 and 3 cuz it's kind of boring. Remember me 2 and 3 have too much lecture in it.
5,Remember Me is the best book that has ever been writen!,"This book, Remember Me, got me hooked on Christopher Pike, the best author in the whole world. You would know why I got hooked on all his books if you ever read Remember Me. I have never read a book that was so... enjoyable and fantastic! If you don't read this book, I swear, you will probably be missing out on your favorite book of all times.A lot of people don't like to read. I used to hate to read, but I've loved reading, especially the books that Christopher Pike wrote, ever since I read Remember Me. All my friends love Christopher Pike too!"
5,Amazing,"I thought that book was amazing and one of the best books that I have ever read. It was, although, VERY cheesy. There were too many ""'I love you!' 'I didn't know that you loved me! I thought you hated me!' 'No! I loved you the very first time I saw you!' "" and what-not.I did however think that this book was amazing on how Pike showed him view on death. It really makes you think and I could't put this book down! It is VERY suspenseful, and I am excited to follow to the sequel..."
4,Simply Fantastic - Another great read from Ms Robards,"Hunter's Moon offers a thoroughly enjoyable read. This is definitely one of her best books. The importance of family, love and trust are the resounding issues in this novel. Readers should find Molly's strength admirable as she is torn between doing what is right and what is best for her family in her relationship with Will and in references to her tumultous childhood. This novel will not disappoint you - so enjoy it soon !"
4,Enjoyed,"Always enjoy Karen Robards.Not too short a novel, with a good interesting story line that is a bit different. Do not enjoy her sex scenes"
5,Wonderful!!!!!!,"Great suspence, great romance, great characters, great plot and great love scenes to boot. I've read a lot of Robards most recent contemporaries and this is definitely a standout. In fact the only one I've kept it on my shelf for years and would never think of trading it away or donating to the neighborhood library book sale. Wonderful!!!!"
3,"We want to love this toy, but we don't.","I know lots of people who own this toy and sing its praises. Unfortunately, we are not those people. I bought this for my 2 year old who is now 3 1/2. He likes to put letters in it for 2 minutes, then starts shoving all of the letters under the fridge. I get it out every six months and try again, but he just doesn't have any interest in playing with this, even though he now has interest in learning about letters and writing. No, he's not developmentally disabled. He just doesn't care for this toy. I really want him to like it and to have the great learning experience with it that everyone else does, but its just not happening for us.For those who wonder about durability, it seems durable. It's been 1.5 years, and still works. I know other families that have had a set on their fridge for years and they still work too."
5,Great Alphabet learning toy,My son got this for Christmas in 2006. I decided to buy this for my nephew for Christmas 2007. It is very durable!! My kids love it!
2,You need to play this toy WITH your child,"I was secretly hoping that this would entertain and educate my 4yo child without taking up my time. You definitely need to play this machine with your child if you want your child to learn. Unfortunately, the voice is very unclear. ""f"" sounds like ""s"". ""hen"" sounds like ""fen"". Heck, even I have to guess what word/letter the machine is trying to spell or say.Also, my daughter gets disappointed when she wants to spell words longer than 3 letters and can't. Can't even spell ""zoo"" because there's only one ""O"".The only good news is that my daughter is paying more attention to spelling and to word/letter sounds than usual. Otherwise, this toy would only get one star from me."
1,Don't buy it....,"These are my problems with this toy...the coloring on the letters rub off to easy, it is too heavy to stay put on the door like it should and my biggest gripe is that it asks you to find letters to spell certain words and one of the words it asked my 4 year old to spell was WAR !! Seriously....war? I couldn't believe it!! Kids that age do not need to spell or know anything about war in my opinion!! There are tons of 3 letter words, why war? Ridiculous!!!"
3,Son is not interested on whammer yet,"I got the word whammer for my 3 year old son. He previously used the alphabet one, and learned his alphabet well. I guess I had great expectations for the word whammer, but my son is not really showing much interesting on it yet. I hope it gets better."
1,I hope this is a new and improved version.,"I bought this product three years ago. The first one misidentified the letters, I complained, and they sent me a new one. The replacement was no better. I asked for my money back; they sent me instructions on how to fix it. I was enraged. Fix a new product?! I stashed it on a shelf and forgot about it. Now, three years later I did attempt to fix it but with no success. Be forewarned!"
3,Wrong Letter,"I purchased this toy a month ago. Now, it reads letters wrong. I'll put a J in the space and it will say S. I love this toy but, now, I need a new one. Otherwise, a great idea. Also, the Leap Frog DVD's are amazing. My 21/2 year old can spell simple words on command!"
4,Letters are NOT interchangeable with OLD version Fridge Phonics,"My daughter loves this Fridge Words. However, I wanted to post that the letters are NOT interchangeable with the old version Fridge Phonics with the frog on it. The Fridge Words letters are smaller than the older Fridge Phonics letters and neither works with the other. I'm disappointed to learn this because I bought her the Fridge Phonics when she was younger and now that she's the right age for the Fridge Words, they've resized the letters. Looking at the store, it looks like the letters are interchangeable with the new Fridge Phonics with the sun on it."
2,other leapfrog letters don't fit,"This is a good toy stand alone. However, we were really hoping to build on his other fridge toy - from the same company - and we have upper and lower case letters from that toy/same company. The letters are not the same size. They are just slightly different. This is ridiculous?! Why? Why? Why? Not only that but they are slightly smaller making them just small enough to fit in the choking tube for our littler one who is following her big brother to the fridge. Now we really can't play with this toy. Shame."
3,Good for learning to spell some words,"I really liked the idea for this toy for my five year old twins, but it was not as great as thought it would be. It is a little hard to hear what the toy is saying even on the loudest volume setting, so they still have to ask me for help. Also if they mis-spell a word, the toy still says ""Great Word"" even thought it wasn't a word!! But they play with it, and have been spelling new words, so overall its not bad."
5,a B-I-G hit with my son.,"My 3 year old LOVES this toy. I had no idea how this thing was going to work when we got it, but it is really ingenious. It gives short simple directions that my son can follow to find letters to build and sound out words. Even how to find rhyming words. Very cool! I was pleasantly surprised that my son was so interested it, and that he could follow the directions rather than just put in random letters. The toy does do a fair amount of ""coaching"" when it senses no letters are being placed, which is a help.Sometimes, as with all technology of this nature the words they say can be hard to understand, when they say ""spell hat"" sometimes you may think they said ""bat"" or ""rat"" until they actually say ""H - A - T"" and spell it out. But that isn't just a problem with leapfrog. This doesn't seem to bother my son as much as it does me though!"
3,2's Enough,"I research the toys I purchase for my children...this one I bought on ""Black Friday"" with high hopes from the reviews that I read on this site (though purchased from Kohl's). To my dismay, there seems to be something wrong with some of the letters in my set and I am glad I cought it now before my two year old learned incorrectly. For example, when placing the ""S"" block into the first space, the Word Whammer recognizes it as a letter ""T"". For someone who is not as involved with their child as I am, this could be a devastating lesson. This toy is a learning toy, meant to improve upon your childs phoenics skills...Needless to say, upon viewing leapfrog.com, there is no way to contact them by email which is also concerning to a parent of two who has better things to do during the day with their children then to call the company when convenient for them!"
1,So disappointed...,"I wanted to love this product. My family has had wonderful experiences with other LeapFrog products, but this one simply was not of the same quality I have come to expect.Like many of the other reviewers, our first Word Whammer did not correctly identify the letter placed in the first slot. The only letters it recognized were C and Q. I returned it to the store and bought another one, hoping for better luck. The second one had the same problem with two of the three slots. Some of the little tabs in the slots (which read the letters) are partially depressed, thereby preventing letter recognition. I found that if I used my fingernails to pick at the tabs prior to inserting a letter, it would sometimes work, but that eliminates any possibility of my son being independent and spontaneous... I hate to say it, but I am returning the second Word Whammer and looking for an alternative product."
3,"Good, but spelling words are odd","Got this for my 2.5 year old. He enjoys putting the letters in and making the words. The problem for me is that some of the words are odd and not words that a 2.5 year old or even a 4 year old would use. Unlike previous reviews, the word ""war"" doesn't bother me because it is a concept that you can explain to a younger child in words they can get, like war means ""fighting"". Yet, there are other words that are difficult and neither interesting or explainable to a him, such as ""lax"" and ""dim"". There are several other words like these, but I can't think of them now. Maybe it's because my kid is only 2.5, but I've worked with kindergardners and have never heard them use these words. I wish Leap Frog had just stuck to basic nouns such as ""bus"", ""car"", and words like that.Unlike other users, I haven't had any problems with it's durability or functioning. It's held up for the past 3-4 months, but who knows what'll happen later."
4,Great product sometimes buggy,"This is a great toy to teach early spelling, phonics, and reading skills. Sadly sometimes the letters on the first slot on my product do not register correctly. If you take them out and put them in again a couple times eventually it seems to get it right. Both my 2 1/2 year old and 1 year old enjoy playing with it quite a lot!"
3,cute,"It gets the letters wrong some. So I think if your toddler is using this to learn their letters, it will mess things up. My older children have fun making words though with it. I don't think it was worth the money though. The alphabet and animal match refrigerator magnets by leapfrog were much better!"
2,Randomly detects the wrong letters,"As my luck would have it, it looks like I got hit with a lemon. I will try and repair my unit per the instructions in the other reviews and report back."
4,Fridge Words Magnetic Word Builder,My grandson who is nearly two can put the letters in but is not capable of making words. He does like the music though. I think this will an excellent learning tool. I'm happy with this purchase
2,Awesome and Disappointing all at the same time!,"My son (2.5 years old) LOVES this product. We had the fridge magnet with the single letters and luckily, this one fits both the new and old magnets. This one comes with all lowercase and we already have all uppercase from the previous magnet. Unfortulatey, it just sort of freezes or shutsdown midplay. My son has learned just to flip the power switch off and then on again...but lame! I wouldn't go through the trouble of returning it, but it is a very disappointing aspect of it. Also, you have to catch the window of when your child is only spelling three letter words. We lay the magnets out on the table or fridge to spell bigger words."
4,Fun and educational,"I love the leap frog fridge toys. My daughter knew her ABC's several months before she turned 2 and now we are working on recognizing simple words. Thanks for the great learning tools, Leap Frog!"
4,"Good, but one small flaw","Product is great, but has one flaw. It recognizes the L as a K. This confuses my 3 year old. I explain to him that our unit or the letter is not right and that he, in fact, is right. I have to place the letter in a certain way to make sure it reads the L correctly. Other than that, we enjoy it!"
4,Good toy,"The day after I put this on our fridge, my pre-schooler could spell 3 words from memory, knowing what they were, and recognizing them if I spelled them. I am very impressed at how this toy does teach."
5,LOVE this thing!,"From helping my then-2 year old learn letters to helping my then-4 year old learn letter sounds to helping my then-6 year old practice spelling short words, this toy has been invaluable. The kids are now 5, 6 and 8 and they still play with it all the time. Between this set, the original single-letter toy and the bonus pack of lower case letters, they have enough magnets for everyone."
1,stay away: unreliable product; horrible customer support,"We bought this toy for our 3-year-old as an EDUCATIONAL toy! It is extremely unreliable. When he placed a t in, it pronounced it as f. He put in FOX with confidence...the toy told him it is not a word! I contacted customer service. They told me they don't have a technical support that can help me. If I want, I can write a letter to their home office. Are you kidding me? The only thing they can offer me is a discount to purchase another Leap Frog. No, thank you. Not going to happen. At first, they dare to tell me it's the first time they've ever heard about the problem. When I told her she should google and see the reviews, she said it's a known issue.They don't care, bad product, bad service, stay away parents."
1,basically useless,"Our 3 year old son loved the Word Whammer... except that it didn't recognize the letters properly, therefore encouraging him to spell words incorrectly, confusing him about letter identification and not complementing him on correctly spelled words. We returned the WW and got another one only to find it had the same problem. This was a huge disappointment as we loved fridge phonics. Do NOT buy the Word Whammer!"
2,No replacement letters,"Although this is very idea and well made toy, it only comes with one of each letter with the exception of a few. When one letter falls under the fridge or misplaced, the toy is virtually useless as you cannot buy replacement letters. You can only repurchase it in it's entirety."
1,"Misreads Letters, Had to Jerry-rig","Bummer, this would be such a cool toy if only it read all the letters correctly. None of the small reader buttons are stuck or anything, which is the only troubleshooting tip from the website. The misreading seems to be due to the letters not fitting in snug enough to depress all the buttons for a correct read, so I've put scotch tape on the ""roof"" of the problem space to make the slot a tiny bit smaller. Now misreadings are less frequent/almost gone, but be careful to keep the tape near the outer edge so that the letters still push in. No, you should not have to do this to make the toy work properly."
2,Disappointing,"I had such high hopes for this toy. I thought it would be a great way for my daughter to learn and practice spelling three letter words. Unfortunately, the unit did not properly recognize the correct letter in several instances. Fresh batteries resulted in no improvement."
4,Broke after two months but they sent a new one,"I sent the product back to them, since it was under warranty. They sent me a brand new one right away, and this one has worked fine for the last year or so.(Original review) My daughter received this gift and loved playing with it. She particularly liked listening to the ABC song. But after only two months, the sound does not work any more. The lights still flash, but no sound comes out. At first I thought it was the batteries, but I tried two different sets of new batteries and it still does not work. Unfortunately the Amazon return policy is only for 30 days. I am going to attempt to get a replacement through Leapfrog, and we will see how that goes. This is my second Leapfrog product that has broken after very little use, and I am starting to become wary of this company. My daughter is very sad that her toy does not work any more, but I am reluctant to buy another one because all their toys seem to break."
3,Great concept... a little disappointing on performance,"This is a great toy concept and I was really excited to buy it for my son who is 21 months old. I could not find this product in any of stores around my house so I decided to go with good ole Amazon. My son instantly gravitated to it and can't leave it alone even to sit down and have dinner sometimes. But the toy doesn't recognize the letters correctly all the time. For this reason I can't give it more than three stars. Very tempted to return the item, but don't fell like going thru the hassle."
5,FANTASTIC!,"I got this hoping that my 4 year old would love it. And not only does she enjoy it, so do my twin 2 year olds! It has 3 different games on it, for different levels of letter and reading recognition. The only thing that I wish was different, was that there were slots for more letters, not just three. I love it and reccomend it!"
2,Disappointing,"I was very excited about the concept of this toy, so I suggested my parents buy it for my son for Christmas. We love the other LeapFrog products that we own, but this one was disappointing. I too, had the problem of letter recognition with this toy. Almost every letter that we put in was identified wrong. So, my husband took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one. That one did the same thing!! So, back to the store he went for a third try. This one we kept. It only identified a letter wrong once. When we tried to call LeapFrog customer service we were on hold for an hour and eventually hung up. I would not recommend this toy to anyone, because you have a very good chance of getting a lemon."
2,Poor quality,"I got the LeapFrog Word Whammer six months or so back for my three year old. It worked fine until about a month ago. The sounds get stuck in a loop as soon as it's turned on and won't stop. Turning it off and replacing the batteries didn't work either. It could be that our one year old has knocked it off the fridge several times, but we also own the LeapFrog Fridge Phonics set which we got when my now four year old was one. It has been knocked off the fridge and batted around MUCH more that the Word Whammer and it still works. I would not recommend this item."
4,Great Learning tool,My son is 3 years old and loves using this set. It helps him recognize letters and teaches him how to spell words. I love it myself and also brought one for my best friends son.
4,Great but died to early,"My son is only 20 months but he loved this. i guess he played with it so much it died. It gets stuck and repeats the same thing until you turn it off. It's not a battery issue, its broken. We will buy another one only because he likes it so much. We have TONS of these letters already though so I kind of wish you could buy it without all those letters.It's a very good learning toy and my son loved it."
4,It works well and sounded quite clearly.,It works well and sounded quite clearly. my 3 yrs old boy is excited about the new toy and learning new words.
1,toy malfunction right out of the box,the second and third slots didn't correctly recognize the letters. I bought this trying to replace a word whammer which also malfunctioned immediately out of the box. Too bad this one didn't work. Also I thought I'd at least be able to use the word whammer letters but they are too large for the Word Builder. Have to figure out how to return this now. bummer.
1,What's going on here??????,"The item says it is ""Word Whammer"" but the picture shows the same ""FridgeWords"" as the other - a stupid newly incompatible gimmick to greedily keep people from using their old letters in combinations or if (oh, how impossible!) a toddler lost a single letter from the old set. This is an vicious marketing trick by a company that doesn't care about customers at all. Can't Amazon at least get it straight and let us know if this is the old or the new version. My review is for Amazon's irresponsible labeling, not for the product, which I don't know if I should buy. I would buy it if I knew it was the compatible WordWhammer. But like everyone else, I wouldn't buy it with the new incompatibility unless I was unethically tricked into it, as so many people have been."
1,Tried 2 and they both didn't work,"Seems to be a serious quality control problem with this product. My 3-yr old daughter got one for Christmas and it has the letter recognition problem so many others have reported. I exchanged it for another one and it also has the problem. I like the idea of the product, but not if it ends up doing more harm than good by teaching wrong letters and confusing little ones. Reading all the reviews makes me wonder what percentage made are defective. Seems like it'd be a high number. Too bad we can't give zero stars because I would."
5,great toys,i bought this for my 3 year old brother for his birthday.. And it is great. we play with it all the time
5,Grandbaby's Phonics Toy,I'm very please with toy. My grandbaby enjoys himself with this toy each time he visits. He's learning at his own pace while having fun challenging himself.
3,Everything is ok but..,The sound is not that clear seems to like I am in the shower booths with this toy.Except that it is pretty helpful and fun.
1,Piece of crap,This toy does not work. Does not correctly identify the letters and the little word game functions do not work either. This product was given to my child by a well meaning relative three years ago. Never have gotten it to work correctly and is a waste of hard earned money. Be warned.
5,LeapFrog Word Whammer,My grandchild is learning how to spell small words on the refrigerator while his Mom is cooking.
4,Word Whammer Fridge Phonics,I bought this for a 4 year old and it's a little difficult for him. There are 4 levels to chose from making it a little overwhelming for a child not quite ready for it. I would have waited a year or so had I looked into it more.All in all a great toy.
3,Only 3 letters?,"How many words can you think of that have 3 letters? Apparently my 4-yr-old and I don't have much of an imigination, because this Fridge Phonics is slightly hard. But it has great potential. Maybe with Kindergarden in the fall..."
1,Fridge Words NOT Word Whammer - letters incompatible,The item by Leapfrog in the shape of an airplane with space for three letters is the FRIDGE WORDS toy. These letters ARE NOT THE SAME SIZE as the letters used with Fridge Phonics from Leapfrog (the toy that fits one size letter). Very disappointing. I believe that the WORD WHAMMER letters (old version of the FRIDGE WORDS) might be interchangeable with the Fridge Phonics.
1,I can't believe this gets 4 stars,I love leap frog and have never had a problem with there products before. I am so disappointed with this one. The word whammer would not recognize letters properly. I changed the batteries and cleaned it as it says to do in the handbook but nothing worked. With many of the same reviews I'm not sure if I should exchange it for another one or return it all together.
1,a Christmas morning bummer,"I'm on my second Word Whammer now because I didn't want my grandson to have to wait for a replacement through the mail. (I ordered the first one online, but not from Amazon--a mistake I won't make again.) The first space of WW consistently gave an incorrect letter and sound. When I contacted LeapFrog via e-mail, I had to wait a week for a reply. Then they gave lengthy instructions on how I could fix the problem. Spend time fixing a brand new toy? I don't think so! So I'm returning it to LeapFrog for a replacement."
2,"Great idea, but unreliable letter recognition",My daughter received this as a Christmas gift last year and it has never worked properly. It started off with one space not working and the company recomended cleaning the sensors with rubbing alcohol and still it has only gotten worse. It is very frustrating for my three year old who knows her letters and the toy gets it wrong and tells her she is wrong. It is very disappointing that the company could not offer any better resolution than to clean the contacts of a new toy.
5,LeapFrog Word Whammer,"I recommend any of the LeapFrog toys. These fridge magnets are really teaching my 4 yr old how to spell and read words. It does take up a bit of room on the fridge, but is worth it when he is occupied while I cook."
5,WONDERFUL ITEM,"This (as with all the other Leap Frog items I have purchased) is awesome. It help kids with recognition of letter sounds, words and colors too. My daughter who is 3 1/2 is spelling and saying words even with the unit turned off!! I would say that this is a GREAT buy!!"
1,First and Second Ones Did Not Work,"Our first Fridge Words toy we purchased incorrectly identified about 1/3 of the letters. We changed the batteries, but it still did not work. We easily (Amazon is awesome!) exchanged it for a second Fridge Words toy. Unfortunately, this one has the same problem. I am so excited about using this toy with my four year old, that I think I will exchange it one more time. Third time is a charm! If the third one works, then I will edit this review to give a more current opinion."
5,Great learning fun,"We got this for our 2 year old, even though the product says it is for 3+. Our little guy has very good verbal skills, and really loves putting in the letters and singing along with the ABC song. Right now, we only use the basic 'put in a letter' option, but I think the word-builder and the word quiz modes will be great over the next year or so. That's really why I chose this toy instead of the other one that just has a space for one letter. I feel like this one is not too much for him right now, but will grow with him over the next few years as well."
3,Excited but didn't last long,I was very excited to give this toy to my son so he can learn to build words. We didn't even have it a month and it broke. I have tried new batteries and anything else I can think of but it is dead. He didn't even get to play with it very long. We have the single letter one and he loves that one. I love how it goes on the fridge and seems very durable.
4,"Sound Quality could be better, but overall a good toy","This was a birthday gift for our 3 year old. This is a great educational toy, but my son just isn't that interested in it."
4,Great toy but scratches!,This toy is very educational but scratched my refrigerator. I didn't think a company would make a toy that would scratch what its purpose is (to go on fridge) but I guess I was wrong. Other than scratching my fridge the toy was well worth it!
4,reading,This toy helps kids learn to read phonetically. They love playing with the magnets and naturally learn while they play.
1,Says the wrong letters - defective,"Our toy said ""e"" for ""f"", ""v"" for ""w"", and ""k"" for ""l"" right out of the box. This problem has been mentioned by other reviewers. This is a defective product. Why does Amazon continue to sell it?"
3,Be careful if looking to add to older version,"I recently received an older version of this from a relative, but not all the letters were included. I found out at Leap Frog's site that they are no longer selling replacement letters, so if you want to fill out your child's letter collection, you have to buy a whole new toy. I thought it would be nice to upgrade to this one since I have the upper case letters and this has the lower case. But the size of the letters is different than they used to be. They are smaller, and don't fit in the older toys the same way. I feel like I just wasted $25!"
2,It's broken!,"I really love the idea of this toy, because it's good for kids a many stages. We got it for my 1 year old for Christmas (2012). It's a magnet so we just kept it on the fridge. It helped my 1 year old with letter recognition and speech development and the songs and funny sounds cracked him up. My 2 year old liked it too and it helped him develop a few 3 letter sight words. But, it sometimes said the wrong letter name for the letter you put it. As the weeks went on it started doing that more and more often. A few says ago it stopped working altogether. It still get's power but the lights are stuck on and it doesn't name the letters you put in or anything else. It was great while it lasted, though!"
4,Just what I needed.,My son is three and a half and goes to daycare. He's exactly at the age where he's picking up a lot vocabulary (not all desirable) from school and friends which he's using to express his anger or frustration. I thought it was a good book to help him understand the power of words and how he can use positive words instead of negative ones...even to express his negative emotions. It's slow going but the book helped me with ideas and with words to coach him.
4,Sticks and stones,"Most of us have heard the old saying... sticks and stones may break my bones but your words can never hurt me, yet we have all been hurt by the unkind words of others. I use this book as an elementary level teaching tool to help children understand that words can hurt feelings and so they must choose thier words carefully. The book is wonderfully illustrated and is a good companion with the book, ""Hands are not for Hitting,"""
5,Great.,This is a must if you have kids or work with kids. Simple but has great information and strategies to help teach new social skills.
4,Good book,We bought this book for my son when he was 3 1/2 and he loved it. Good illustrations and story.
5,Great book for Pre-K,I got this book for my son. He really enjoys it. It is simple enough that my toddler enjoys it also
5,These guys are ready for the big-time.,"The new cd Better Days is a great mixture of songs by a band that has certainly matured over the years. The sound is very polished and has a tight feel to it. This is the cd that Dayroom fans have been waiting for and new fans will be made with. The band has a great sound which includes a mind numbing bass line and outstanding keyboard touches. Vocals are very intense and unique. The overall song writing is superb with great lyrics and thoughts riding on some very talented sudio work. I recommend it highly so that when these guys become huge you can say you knew them way back when. Time is running out, get on the bandwagon."
3,"Simply toy, good for a bored, food-motivated kitty","I bought this as a way to get my food-motivated kitty to eat his food slower, and it does the trick. He loves this thing. As for me, I think it's a simple decent product that does what it's supposed to. The opening is relatively large, but I use it with a larger kibble like Max Cat ([...]) , or if using it with smaller kibble I use masking tape to make the opening smaller. There's a similar product on the market with a variable-sized opening thhat i haven't yet tried, but this one works fine as long as it's with larger-sized kibble. Easy to open and clean."
4,Squealer loves it!,My cat loves this. It also helps her to eat a little slower so that she doesn't throw up.....I little hard to open though.
4,Old Cats != New Tricks,"Cat ""Go, Cat, Go!"" Treat Balls / B000197ZQWI love this idea - why did I never think of this until I got a puppy and a similar toy for him? Unfortunately, my 4 year old lazy kitties don't seem as interested as I would hope - they like to eat the treats that fall out when I shake it, but they won't chase the ball themselves. Are they too dumb to figure it out? Too lazy to exert the effort? I can't tell you. I think these are a great idea, and I will definitely keep them around in case we have another younger kitty come into the household - I have a hunch that a younger kitten would go after these like crazy!"
1,shipping overpriced,I almost bought this for my cat i have been looking for a item like this at local stores so i placed the order and was reviewing everything i also bought several other items so did not think anything of the total until i looked at the invoice for this particular item the toy cost a 1.99 but they get you with shipping it was 6.55 bringing the total to 8.54. i thought it was overpriced and cancelled my order i guess it is buyer beware!!!!!
2,not quite tricky enough and high mess potential,"I got this toy because I wanted my cat to work a little for his food. This toy was not the cat-torturing puzzle I was hoping for. Unfortunately, my cat figured out how to get the food out efficiently in under 3 minutes. It's not terribly tricky as the toy is essentially a hollow plastic ball with a hole in one side. Food comes out almost every time my cat taps the ball. It comes out so easily, more comes out than he sometimes wants to eat in one sitting. I often find little trails of kibble all over the living room. Still, I guess having to tap the ball a few times to get his food is more work than just eating it out of a bowl. Also, you can pry the ball open so that you can clean it, which is a plus."
1,Not for smart cats!,"I have a half-Siamese and he got the food out of the balls in record time. If you cat is smart, try plastic soda bottles with a few holes punched in them. These balls are just too easy for MENSA cats."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Design","This is a good idea for a product, but the design is poor.After I had ordered the 2-pack for around $7 with shipping, I found a 4-pack at the 99 store, so I felt that I paid too much.The design makes it difficult to put the two halves back together once you have loaded the food or treats.I would recommend cutting a small hole in a tennis ball. That is what I have done and my cat seems to like it better.If you still want this product, let me know, I'd be happy to send it to you for the price of the shipping."
3,Plastic too brittle,"I bought this because my cat likes to eat and has figured out how to cheat a non-ball type automatic food dispenser. The balls came in a package of 2 and upon trying to open one of the balls to put the treats in, the plastic broke. So, I filled the 2nd one and it took her about 5 minutes to get all the treats out. I think she enjoyed it though, so will continue to use it. Any little challenge is better than none for this smart kitty. Why do they make cat toys out of such cheezy materials?"
2,"A poor follow up to ""One and One is One""","I ordered a copy of this album prior to its release, based on the quality of their previous album, ""One and One is One"",which is a rich, complex and highly musical recording. What I got with ""We are Three"" is disappointing, to say the least. Gratingly repetitive, uninteresting themes and a continuous velocity with almost no breathing room, it comes off as a quick-to-the-retailers compilation of banged out riffs that would hopefully ride the coat tails of a carefully crafted first album. You can do alot better than this, guys- we already know what you're capable of. You set the mark, now raise it. Don't release anything other than your best."
4,Holy wow did this take forever to assemble!,"4 people, 7 hours, over the course of 4 days. That's what it took to assemble this behemoth.However, now that it's put together, it seems to have been a worthwhile purchase."
5,Great bedtime friend,"Each of my three kids have one of these (in different colors)and they love them. We travel alot, and the bunnies go too. They are soft but not the furry plush, so they maintain their look. Machine washable also helps, too. Just throw them in a pillowcase. I love them and so do the kids."
4,Good book to clutch when you visit San Francisco,"It's a very good collection of writings about San Francisco - not necessarily always great literature - though there is some very good writing indeed. Some of the pieces are ""just"" very good journalism - topical, inciteful, well-written. So if you want to learn more about the atmosphere and the arguments in the Castro when AIDS emerged or discover more about San Francisco's very own brand of narcissism, this is the book. It's a very good read."
2,Yugioh Duel Monsters: Pyramid of Light,"I read that the unedited Japanese version of the ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" Movie premiered in Japan in Special Japanese theaters with tickets and a new Japanese Movie promo card: ""Watapon"" on November 3, 2004. Also the Japanese Yu-Gi-Oh! Movie premiered in Japan's Limited normal Japanese theaters on Christmas Eve, 2004. And since it's released in theaters, TV Tokyo wil air the Japanese version of the ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" Movie on TV (in Japan only) on January 2nd, 2005! I can't wait to see the Unedited Japanese version of the ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" Movie. The new Japanese title is: ""Yugioh Duel Monsters: Pyramid of light"", Uncut, in 115-minutes in Japan, not the US (Well, the US version is edited in 90-minutes)."
1,YU-GI-D'OH,"This film is a testament to how short sighted the mainstream viewing public is, how can children LIKE this crap? It's just an hour long toy commercial with the product forced down your throats every two minutes...and eventually every four seconds.The film follows EXACTLY the same plot as the series: The characters talk ENDLESSLY about the rules of the game, using card strategies that seem to come out of...nowhere, before pulling out a ""shocking card that turns the tide"" all whilst explaining this to the audience who have no clue what is going on.The series is rubbish, the film only has moments of quality humour (from Pegasus, who steals the film) but apart from that, it's a toy commercialIf you want to see a movie that is worth watching AND will keep children buying toys, watch the all time classic Transformers: The Movie, or Pokemon 2000, those films have1. A plot2. Character development3. No bad jokes (except for Daniel in Transformers: The Movie)"
1,Misleading,"The only reason I bought this DVD is for the accompanying card, and that's why I ordered a new product of a movie I've already seen. I found it quite annoying that the item was not new in any way. Part of the cover was scratched, the disk was damaged, and there was no card in it. It was really depressing when I opened it."
3,Good Movie!(iT COMES WITH A CARD),I liked it but the duel of Yugi vs. Kaiba was too long. Other that that it was great. And yes(answering someones question)it does come with a free card)
1,One of the Worst Movies I've ever Seen!,"I think this movie sucks because It's like the Television Series like how Yugi and Kaiba duel each other like in the Television Series! I am also a big Anime fan and this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I mean I've seen alot of Anime movies like Pokemon, DragonBallZ, Cowboy Bebop, Spirited Away, Final Fantasy, Returner and even Ghost in the Shell. But if you really want to see an Anime Movie please don't rent or buy this Movie because this is one of the worst Anime Movies I have ever seen!"
4,If you like the show you will probably like this movie,The movie was pretty good. You could tell the production value on it was higher than you are used to on the TV shows. I'm a little older so I probably didn't enjoy this as much as a younger kid would...so if you're buying this for a kid they will probably love it. Plus it comes with a card if you buy it new and that's always a plus for kids as well. Nothing super interesting happens but if you are a Yu-gi-oh fan you will probably enjoy this.
5,Sweet,"It was marked used but it showed up like it was brand new. It works great, no scratches, shipped fast, and worth my money."
2,Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie,"I read that the Unedited Japanese version of the Yu-Gi-Oh! Movie is released in special Japanese theaters with tickets and a new Japanese promo movie card: Watapon, on November 3rd, 2004. Also the Yu-Gi-Oh! Movie is released in Japan in Limited normal Japanese theaters on Christams Eve, 2004. I love to see the Japanese uncut version of the ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" Movie. The new Japanese title is: ""Yugioh Duel Monsters: Pyramid of Light"", uncut, in 115-minutes in Japan, Not US (Well, the US version is edited in 90-minutes)!"
1,DIE!!!!!!,This movie made me wanna take the next plain to New York to punch every single stud at 4kidsentertainment!!!! Whoever made this movie should get shot!!!!Note: I'm not under 13.
4,Question on Yu-Gi-Oh The Movie,My son really likes this movie. However he was very disappointed that the movie did not come with a free yu-gi-oh card as stated on t.v. commercials and other advertising. Would someone know if this movie was supposed to come with a free card? Thanks
3,Anime movies don't work,"Other than what everyone else has said, I will focus on the gameplay in the duel.1. How many normal summons did Anubis, Seto and Yugi do during their turns?2. Pyramid of Light affected the God Cads in this duel. TRAP CARDS DO NOT AFFECT GOD CARDS.3. The Sorceror of Dark Magic is not the same as the one on the card.4. Yugi special summoned Blue Eyes Shining Dragon. On the card it reads: This card cannot be Special Summoned except by offering 1 ""Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon"" on your side of the field as a Tribute.If this was improved a bit, it would make 4 or 5 good tv episodes."
1,Yugioh : The Movie!....... Ahem!.... Yugioh: The Boredom!,"I rented this at Blockbuster. This movie is boring. The main villan is Anubis and he only appears in the movie for 5 minutes. The movie does not flow well. More than half of the movie is about one duel and if it is all about one duel, they should make it good. Right? The duel only contained a few cards. They kept playing the same cards, reviving them, attacking, and you get the point. You will regret getting this. The duel is so boring. Anubis is what this movie is supposed to be about and he appears and it takes 5 minutes to destroy him. This will just make duelists believe that the cards used in the movie are good and they are not. And since when will someone come up to you and say ""Duel me and the loser dies""? My suggestion is to stay away from this. The first 30 minutes are good and then it degenerates. You look for the good part that you think is coming up, but it never does."
3,The Yu-Gi-Oh! Movie,"The yugioh movie was rather interesting. But, the yugioh movie intrests very little people. Even some Yu-Gi-Oh! fans will not find the movie that interesting. Overall, rent the dvd or the vhs but dont buy the movie."
3,"Better than the Series, but still only Average","I hate the show Yu-Gi-Oh, but I was dragged into watching it with my cousin. I was very confused in the beginning, but eventually the movie explained itself. The plot had many parts and it was inevidible that i admired those.The story had to deal with one guy, Kaiba?, who wanted to defeat Yugi. To do this he had to get a special card. Instead he got 2, but one was planted. When Yugi and Kaiba duel, they are really just being used so another evil person can take over the world.Although the storyline was odd, the movie stayed on the same path. It had so many different parts, that even the biggest Yu-Gi-Oh hater could like it and feel the suspense.I'm still not a fan because I find the whole evil card monster things way to farfetched, but if you're forced to watch it, grin and bear it. You'll agree with me that it wasn't a COMPLETE waste of time."
5,Messages for children on Keys to Happiness,"I am a Psychotherapist and work with adults, families and children. A large part of my practice is working with parents on parenting skills and helping parents encourage children to follow values that lead to happiness and fulfillment. I recently came across Hans Wilhelm's new book, All For the Best: The Secret to Happiness. This book teaches children to accept things ""as the best"" without reacting emotionally to what goes on and to maintain balance and stay focused on what they are doing -- primary values to happiness. The whimsical illustrations awaken the senses and highten the enjoyment. It's an excellent book to promote conversation with children on how to accept what comes, maintain balance and remain focused with the end result of happiness. As a therapist and grandparent, I recommend this book to any parent or grandparent to share with their children and grandchildren a message on how to be happy."
1,Waste of Money!,"I have used this guitar for some time now, the build and materials are poor quality and the buzz from the bridge is ruthless, no matter what I did it was still there.My model came with a pick guard that was more ugly than effective and did not complement the abalone ring around the sound hole.One major problem came when the time for a string change was due, am not sure what gauges were installed but they were no larger than point tens (.10), so I chose .10 and,,, big surprise, the whole bridge came of while tuning the guitar to half step down.One good thing, hence one star, is the built in equalizer and tuner,,, THEY WORK!Will try to fix the bridge, but really not worth the money."
5,"Excellent, Affordable Resource","This is a very good attempt to pull together the different strands of reformed thought into a single volume for quick use. Of course, any book of this type will leave some unsatisfied ,and my own objection to it is that too much space is given to theologians and organizations which are really NOT reformed in the sense that most of us would understand it. I don't see any need for a long article on the World Council of Churches right after a long one of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. Many of the theogians selected were reformed in background alone and changed entirely in view. Still, the material on Protestant scholaticism is great and most of the major points are hit. Though a book twice the size is needed, this is certainly a fine attempt."
1,seriously lacking,"This text is lacking a substantial number of entries, e.g., aseity, animism, panentheism very out of date book and not worth the money - get Westminster Dictionary, or write a new book!"
5,Hilarious B-Horror Movie!!,"If you love B-Horror or Sci-Fi movies (ex. Ed Wood movies) or just movies that are so non-nonsensical and/or corny that you can't help but laugh, you NEED this movie in your collection! I don't even like 70s movies, but this was too good to pass up!"
2,Lackluster,"This kind of anthology is long overdue, which is why it is so unfortunate that this is the only one on the market. Although it is meant to correct the absence of a panamerican perspective in the study of early American literature, trained hispanists everywhere would be outraged by the substandard introductions and shoddy editorial work here. A collection like this one needs at least one editor with a *solid* background in colonial Latin American studies and some recognition in the field."
4,Old news but interesting,"I'm not sure I'd recommend this book to anyone who isn't an Anglophile or a Diana fan. I ordered it hoping my picture with Diana might be in it as it is in 3 other Trevor Hall books but alas, no. Still it's worthy of a place in my extensive Diana-mania shrine."
3,A photo book of Charles and Diana with commetary from Hall.,"Hall's book is full of large, color photographs of Charles and Diana before and shortly after thier marriage in the eighties. The photos are arranged in such a way it as though the narrator,Hall, is laying down the storyline visually as he tells it. This book makes for great conversation and is a must read for those who love the royal family and for those who miss Diana."
4,Must have for gardening!,"All I can say is ... GET IT! If you're planning on gardening, this is a must have. In growing a healthy, productive garden, it's essential to understand the soil. The soil to your plants is like food to us. If it's not healthy, it won't produce healthy plants. Then you eat unhealthy plants. It all starts with the soil and this is the original. Simple, direct, concise."
3,"Slightly off-focus, but still shades of brilliance abound","3 1/2Continuing to mine an assured fusion of jazz and electronic sentiment, A Livingroom Hush presents a more laid back approach to dabbling with these hybrid structures. Maybe against the unit's best intentions, the majority of relaxed, though complex songs do rob a certain urgency present in the groups finer moments. While certainly not slacking in this more downtempo approach, the few fast-burning, melodically brilliant tracks such as the misleading opener definitely slap some of the affectionate lethargy starting to creep in over the more experimental, toothless forays. Where they are not trying to gently coast upon some beat-infested repetition, (coming across a less musically inclined, more dj-worthy approach like Bonobo) the Jazzist's are still managing to melodically innovate more effectively then most experimental, horn-based groups."
5,Worked great!,"Like other commenters, I also use this wrench to remove the k&n oil filter (from a nissan xterra). It worked very well for that purpose, so much easier than the regular wrench I used to use. It's true that it only needs 5 degree to fasten and turn again."
4,Good Basic Book,"This is a good book on Power Electronics, but could use many more examples. There are no problem solutions with the book either."
2,No example problems and no solutions to problems?!,"This book lacks two very important parts, example problems and solutions to the chapter problems. There is not one sample problem worked out in the entire book, and no explanations or solutions to the problems at the end of the chapters. How are you supposed to understand the problems without one single example?! I hope your instructor gives you good examples in class, because this book won't. That being said, the explanations are OK, and there are some good drawings and circuit diagrams. If you need examples like me, find a different book."
1,HORRIBLE,"I did not enjoy this book at all, I think I wasted my money,The whole time I was reading it I kept wondering what Bible he was using.Also I have no Idea what his religious beliefs are. I can not even guess. He basically calls all middle eastern people lairs and thinks that was a normal way of life. Very disappointed. I will not be reselling or giving this book to anyone I know and I will be shedding it before I throw it in the garbage."
5,Great pen for the price,"Perfect short term kennel for our Irish Wolfhound. Expandable but we opted to use a 2 panel section purchased separately for a top instead, for more security and stability."
3,Good for the price.,I kept 2 kittens in one of these for a few weeks. It is made sturdy for the price.
4,A game that is a good game! Maybe hard but fun!,Well let me say this! It's a good game! But I'm surprised that Tweety is your enemy! I don't remember that in Looney Tunes? Fun though! Buy it trust me you'll have to get used to it! But buy it used! I warning you though it's hard! I know it only 29 levels! But there is a reason why they lowered the game levels gosh do you guys have a big problem! It's hard that's why they lowered it! From Carl Eric Jensen p.S Just buy it! You know it has good graphics length is long!
5,Rare; Awesome Title,This is the best in the series and is a very rare find. The levels ramp up and half way through gets tough (the witch at the end is very simple). This is great for all levels and ages of gamers and is best for kids on a trip or on a rainy day. You will complete the game fast but you will get 20+ hours of replay value until you can put it away for a while and take it out to enjoy again.
2,Sub-par,"im a huge soccer fan and i grew up during these world cups, but i cannot recommend this dvd...the picture quality is passable but the scores dont update themselves, which means you are watching one match and seeing the score for another, which is very annoying...it looks like a 5 year old edited this, is this the best you can do guys>? also baggio's wondergoal during italia '90 is missing, i was very disappointed, as this is one of the great world cup highlights. All this is crowned off by poor narration...and no build up to goals and other noteworthy incidents...honestly id return this if i could."
1,A drunk must have put this DVD together,"Horrible quality, narration, and editing. The scores on the screen don't even correspond to the games on screen!?!! I'm a huge soccer fan so I can't say I didn't enjoy it, but the people who put it together did a very poor job. Save your money. By the way volumes 1,2 and 3 are exactly the same."
4,Opteka Slide Copier for Canon A540 Camera,"Finally received the Opteka Slide Copier and it fitted the Canon A540 camera without any problems although the fitting is a little loose.The slide copier works well using the macro mode of the camera although it is imperative to eliminate any dust from the slide.It would have helped to explain that an adapter was also being shipped which was used to attach the Opteka Slide Copier to the camera model chosen. It was confusing to see the same picture of the Opteka Slide Copier for all of the different camera choices but no accopanying adapter included in the picture.My biggest complaint was that, despite 47St Photo saying they could ship internationally, Amazon insisted that the product had to be shipped to a US address which was a significant inconvenience."
2,Bizzare,"This has to be the strangest game that I have ever played.It's about a doctor,who goes off the deep end and kills off everybody in a hospital.So his daughter(you) has to go into the hospital to investigate what's going on,and to find her father.The gameplay is absolutley terrible.You move slower than a snail.Moving around in this game,takes FOREVER.The graphics are cheesey-looking cinematics,that look dreadful(even for an older game) The dialouge is so bad,that it's laughable.It's very funny to hear your father calling your name...""Laura.Laura.This..is..your...father"".See what I mean? Overall,this game does have a few scary moments,but it's otherwise mostly cheesey,outdated and just down right bad.Also,there is absolutley NO saving in this game.If you wanna beat it,you have to play it ALL THE WAY THROUGH.For TWO HOURS! But,I can assure you,after two minutes,you'll be bored to death of this game,from how lame it is.If you want a good survival horror game,then look elsewhere."
1,I bought the LEMON and learned that Sharp Customer Svc SUCKS,"Don't make the mistake of buying a Sharp product. I bought this unit two weeks before xmas, and half the movies I played were not viewable. After endless phone calls and hours of waiting to speak with a live person, I was instructed to send the unit for warranty repair to Tucker, GA (mind you I live in Charlotte, NC). Three weeks later I still haven't received a replacement unit (though I'm told one is on the way) and they refuse to give me a refund. They have also refused to reimburse me the $50 shipping cost for sending the unit to their nearest service center. The quality of the unit doesnt matter to me anymore. The BOTTOM LINE is that if you encounter a problem with it, it will be a NIGHTMARE to get your problem resolved. I mailed my unit in for repair on Dec. 31st. Today is January 18th, and I still don't have it back. Don't waste your time on a Sharp product. I know I won't ever again."
1,Won't Play DVD's Anymore,"The stupid machine will not play DVD's anymore. It performed wonderfully at first, but not anymore. I have had nothing but problems with the machine. And don't get me started with Sharp's technical support. They are horrible. The GA repair people are rude and inconsiderate. Don't buy this player because it will give you nothing but problems."
1,My new Sharp DVD Broke the second day I had it,"Like the guy in NC, I bought this unit from Amazon on January 12, 2000. I got it, it played one movie, and then broke. The sound still works well, but the DVD player will not pick up any movies. The authorized sharp service dealer in Houston, Texas where I live will not fix it (for some reason), so I have to ship the damn thing to Independence Missouri to get it fixed. I had the damn thing 2 DAYS! What a pain in my butt."
5,Excellent product from SHARP,"I've had the unit for about two years now and I'm very satisfied. The quality of the picture and sound are excellent. It has 5.1 Surround and PRO Logic, which is a neat feature that let me hook up my VCR to one of the 3 AUX inputs and watch VHS tapes in surround (The VCR is HIFI stereo, also a SHARP, and the tapes have to be recorded with surround). It has advanced features like optical digital output and supports DTS. The speakers are very nice and they make it great both for movies and for music. The best part is that EVERYTHING YOU NEED IS INCLUDED (except for the popcorn)! Bottom line is that I highly recommend this unit to anyone who wants high-end home theatre experience at a great price!"
5,The Cat,"Jungle Cat talvez seja o melhor álbum do pianista Manfredo Fest, gaúcho cego e inteligente que abandonou o vanero e mergulhou no jazz. Um dos precursores da bossa nova, Manfredo teve formao clássica, mas logo se apaixonou pelo bebop. Nesse disco, além da sólida cozinha, conta a presena marcante do trompetista Cláudio Roditi em algumas faixas. Sua morte, em 1999, foi mais uma grande perda para a música brasileira contempornea."
3,Too basic.,"Even though the stories are alright, the game just doesn't hold interest and doesn't have enough things for kids to DO. There are better programs out there, and School Zone does a lot of good ones. But this one is not rich enough to keep kids coming back after playing it through once."
3,good independant film with no real ending,"the movie was made for 6 thousand dollars, spend two more and have a real ending, enjoyed the movie, the director/producer, gary, signed my copy for me when i bought it, i'm a zombie fan and liked it, but lacked a real ending which it really needed, glad i bought it for my collection, but don't expect resident evil or return of the living dead, will update this after i watch the movie again, for thats when i can really give a detailed review on it, but hated not showing a real ending.possible spoiler alert.the other big problem is how they went from one scene to another, for example, when the people in the car saw someone in the road fall down, they stop to help, next thing you know the guy got bitten and you don't see how, maybe they messed up the scene so just cut it, but the movie needed that scene, that happened about three times.i've seen bigger budget movies that i liked less then this movie, will keep it, even with the lousy no ending shown.."
2,Deadlands 2: Trapped,"I read the review of this product and I was informed that Deadlands Two is better than Deadlands One. The first Deadlands went nowhere and was too short, so it had to be somewhat better. If you like lowbudget Zombie flicks, the film is menza menz! The dialogue at times is dumb. The reasoning by the characters regarding how to escape their plight could have been written better. The acting id so-so and the storyline so-so. Purchase this if the price is not too extensive. But do not expect a whole lot, so you won't be disappointed."
2,Meh,"Low budget, bad acting, and preposterous plot. Preposterous even for a zombie/living dead flick. The government (sigh) develops a virus intended for use to make ""super soldiers"" (stop me if you've heard this before). What's more, they decide to test it on a town in Maryland. Like I said, preposterous. For die-hard zombie fans only."
2,A Long-Winded Rendition Of A Familiar Theme,"Even if you're willing to believe that these two men are channeling the thoughts of 3 spirits, at the very least, these spirits are not particularly inspired. This book is basically a long-winded over-explanation of a familiar theme in self-help books and New Age spiritualism: Everything happens in your life because you subconsciously want it to and you can consciously channel that internal energy to attain more desirable and focused goals. With this follow-up book, Fengler & Varnum have now stretched this simple idea into about 500 pages overall. If you read Hernacki's ""Ultimate Secret To Getting Absolutely Everything You Want"" you'll get the same idea in 400 fewer pages and save yourself $25 to boot. Or just read ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"" again and get the same basic message."
1,Don't waste your money,"I currently own the Haynes manual for this car (a '91 Corolla). It covers a very broad range of models...from '84 - 92. So one would think that a ""model specific"" manual that covers only the 90-93 years would be much more precise and informative. WRONG! This manual is not much more than the owners manual you have in your glovebox (ok, that's an exaggeration). But it is pretty worthless. If I could have browsed this book before I bought it, I wouldn't have bought it. The Haynes manual is still the best you can do....unfortunately..."
2,Not for my '91,"Regarding the Chilton's 90-93 Corolla manual, I'd give it two-and-a-half stars if I could. It's better than no manual at all. I acquired a super low-mileage '91; I don't know much about Corollas, but I know these maintenance schedules and other bits of information pertain to older models than my car, and probably older than a '90 as well. If I hadn't used the glovebox manual as a guide, my car would have gotten a lot of unnecessary maintenance, and witnessed a lot of headscratching.I bought my book some time ago. This one has a different cover and might have addressed the above problems, but I wouldn't bet on it."
2,Cheap and poor quality,"I was very excited to find these sunglasses online, as I have always used them,,,(not this brand) and need new ones. Bought two pair. First on broke, (clip just snapped off) with a month...second one fell from my pocket, in the house, snapped in half. The ones I used to buy lasted years. Just realize, these may look exactly the same, and Seem the same, but the quality IS NOT the same, so consider them disposable. No idea where to get these now, as I can't find them in any stores. Too bad. they were great, like so many things used to be. Also be aware...all of the clip ons like this on Amazon.com seem to be sold by VS, or Victoria's Secret...so none of them will be any better."
2,too close together,"The lenses are very clear but the plastic pieces are too close together for my glasses. Problem is, I don't have any way to specify this for an on-line purchase so I guess I have to go back to haunting drug stores until they come up with what I need."
2,Fits me funny,"I found that the plastic clasp in the middle pressed against my forehead and bridge of my nose, the fit is annoying and I'm sending them back. The plastic coating on the nubs is very cheap and falling apart out of the box, so these could end up scratching your lenses. The actual lenses are of good quality (hence two stars instead of one), but definitely not worth $11. Regret buying these."
4,Like they were advertised,"I bought a pair of these sunglasses to replace a pair that was lost and they arrived in good condition. They were represented truthfully in the advertisements and met nearly all criteria that I consider to be important. However, buying through the internet did not allow me a chance to try them on before purchase. When a product really needs to fit a certain way, it might be fairly important to try on the fit before purchase. In my case, the fit was disappointing. Technically they clip on like clip-ons but it's not a comfortable fit. The clasp is slight too small and I have to remove the glasses so that I'm able to use my vision to guide the clipping on. That drawback lessens the value of these clip-ons when trying to drive a car. However, once they're clipped on correctly, they work fine."
3,Not as dark as they could be,"My husband got these and they are a little too small for his glasses. (on the bottom) They aren't real dark, but are better than nothing. We can't seem to find clip ons any more, so he's glad to have found these. Shipping was fast!"
5,...,This album is a snapshot of a genius in a moment of genius and is an all-time favorite of Jazz musicians as well as lay-fans. Even a rock and roller will have her mind blown by the easy driving grooves on this album...
5,Time for Ladder of the Soul #2,"Beautiful throughout. Mr. Baker, your music is wonderful. I feel totally peaceful while stretching the morning. It' time for another masterpiece."
5,Soul Connections,"I thought that the previous CD that I owned by Paul Baker was some of the best Harp music I had heard. I was surprised to purchase this album and find an even more powerful connection to peace and balance as a result of listening. I now use this CD almost exclusively when I work with new clients (I used to use Paul's last CD for this purpose). The music is immediately calming and at the same time seems to bring a sense of peace that is quite delightful. I gave a copy of the Tranqui Harp to UCLA for use by their Oncology Outpatient clinic, and intend to do the same with this CD. In particular, it provides the perfect background music with which to help individuals explore highly charged and personal issues. I'm anxious to see what Paul Baker comes out with next and have become a real fan...he has magic fingers that remind me of Harpo Marx!"
1,It's great...,"This is the same book that we found in Fort Collins, Co. about 40+ years ago. My husband is Belgium and so I got the book for the rest of the family. So glad to find it and everything in good condition."
4,Want a read how to get a scholarship?,"This book really helps you. It gives more opitions than just good grades and also tells you how to do it with good grades. I learned SAT scores can help as well. If you read this book I guarntee will get some type of scholarship, but if you don't know you looked in the right place because now I am so sure that will get some type now and then I did before. The reading is worth every minute."
4,Fun,"These are fun to learn with but they are a little too bouncy and hard, unlike the bean bag juggling balls. Overall these were pretty ok for the price."
3,Not for heavy use,"The Juggling balls look great, but once you start juggling the weight differences between balls is pretty unnerving. One ball is packed full while another one is maybe 7/8 full and the third one is 3/4 full. The sewing around the balls is also sketchy. After just 3 days one of the balls (the full one) came undone. While it works as a set of juggling balls, you could probably find a set somewhere else that was more durable and more evenly-weighted."
3,Okay.,"This game is better than its SNES counterpart, but is still quite dated by the standards of today. Not bad, but it could have been better."
2,I was immediately dissapointed in this soundtrack.,I first bought this soundrack as an LP record back in the 80's. I more recently purchased it on CD and I listen to it very seldem. I don't know what gets into the minds of soundrack producers that often encourages them to offer new arrangements to the music originally featured in a film or in this case a TV show. I was so looking forward to hearing the great music from the Addams Family TV series unaltered. While some of the music is very much like or actually is the same as in the TV show more of it has rather bizarre altered arrangements for unknown reasons. I know that Mr. Mizzy has the masters and I believe owns the rights to all the original music cues for the Addams Family and how I wish he would make them available to all of us who loved the music in this series. Let's all write to him and encourage such a release.
1,THIS IS AN OFFICIAL SOUNDTRACK???,"This cd is a real stinker. That's right, a real stinker. most of the tracks sound like they were done by that Brazil 66 band. And the rest sound like the Nelson Riddle Orchestra. I could have put together a much better soundtrack than this pathetic attempt. Amazon doesn't want to let you hear samples because they are not the actual music cues heard in the show and they know it sucks. Don't be fooled. Trust me, if you really know The Addams Family tv show, this cd will only serve to anger you. I now have a better opinion of my At Home With The Munsters album."
5,Vic Mizzy's Addams Family Music - Creepy and Kooky!,"I'm surprised to hear any grumblings from people wanting to hear the original TV soundtrack, as most of that TV stuff was incidental music, and only heard in small portions. ""The Addams Family"" CD contains 13 (how appropriate!) pieces of music based on the incidental music, but fleshed out (eek) into full-length pieces. They are tremendously silly and fun, and meant for light-hearted listening. A friend of mine gave me a copy on cassette tape back in the 80's (now that's scary!) and I was so sorry when the tape was eaten by someone's car tape player. I never forgot the music, though, so when I had a chance to buy this I pounced on it. My absolute favorites are ""Gomez""- so bouncy, eccentric and happy, and ""Morticia""- ethereal as the character herself, but others on this collection are quite catchy as well. If you can take creepy and kooky, buy this CD!"
2,Falls Short,"This is the second Richard Jury mystery I've read and this time it was a struggle to get through it. I kept waiting for signs of Jury's investigative genius which never materialized. It was also surprising what a minor role Jury seemed to have, which was mostly refusing to believe that Jenny committed the murders but leaving it to other characters to uncover the truth. I dare say the book could be improved by deleting all the passages with Jury, or at least I think (unfortunately) that that would do little harm. And as for the plot ... I don't know ... not all that interesting. That said, I hope to pick a better book in the same series next time."
2,Disappointing,"I have to agree with other reviewers. I've never spent a year trying to finish one novel before, particularly popular fiction, but here we are. I'm a huge fan of Martha Grimes and her cast of characters but they're simply not here. It's mostly just Jury and Plant, with a little bit of Wiggins and Trueblood sprinkled here and there.Worse, the pace is surprisingly tedious. When I read a mystery, I like to feel like I'm finding out new information as we progress, but most of the scenes feel like we've been here before, a few chapters back, having the exact same conversation, and it feels like ""Why am I reading this *again*?""I've read all her Richard Jury novels in order up to this one, and I hate to say it but as much as I've always loved them, for the first time ever I finally set this book aside half-finished."
4,Compelling characters,"I hadn't read a Martha Grimes Richard Jury mystery in some time, but I found her even better than I had remembered. All the characters seemed compelling, interestingly developed, and except for one, likeable. Jury and Plant were especially sympathetic in dealing with the Jennifer Kenniston issues/past experiences/ question of her guilt. The child character, Zel, was one of my all-time favorites. And while the mystery had considerable interest, it was the interplay among the characters that was the most enjoyable element--even Marshall Trueblood outdid himself in this effort. A rattlingly good read!Kathryn LePage, Cincinnati, OH"
2,Did a ghost writer write this?,I've read everyone of Martha Grimes Richard Jury mysteries and enjoyed them. The rich dialog and description. This one has none of that. In fact the dialog between Melrose and Jury in the first chapter sounded like a beginning writer's attempt at pithy dialog. I'm about half way through and keep wondering if this book was ghost written. It is truly terrible. These great characters deserve better.
3,"Martha Grimes is Good, but she makes me nuts","Somebody please help meI keep reading the Richard Jury novels and Ikeep hoping to figure out the characters andI never doRichard J. Needs a life. Melrose Plant needs alife. All those people in Long Pidd do,Real people just don't behave that way.For god's sake, Richard, if you want to knowwhat's up with Jenny, ask her! What's with thisten-year-long mooning around?Still, Martha writes so well. The prose is sosmooth. The plots are so interesting. And MGdoes great things with her strange child charactersWhy at the end of every novel am I leftfrustrated and unsatisfied?Any answers would be appreciated>"
1,absolutely dull!,"I bought this because reviews on the back cover stated it was as good as Sayers, Christie, etc.Indescribable boredom best describes my feeling prior to putting the book in the bin - I could not even give it to a charity bookshop - it was so dull!!The English speech patterns are obviously derived from Coronotaion Street or such like soaps - while the effect sought is apparently PG Wodehouse with a touch of The Nine Tailors.Characters have tedious conversations, the hero - a Scotland Yard policeman - apparently has no work to do, but he is in love with a Lady Kennington - therefore very posh! The only entertaining character is the owner of an antiques shop - but that's just because he is very rude about everybody else!"
4,"Two murders, a Scotland Yard detective and a pub.","I don't think it will give anything away to tell the reader the the title ""The Case Has Altered"" is the name of a pub in Lincolnshire. More specifically the Lincloln Fens, an area that was under the North Sea and was reclaimed. Where tuplips are grown, hence the nickname; Little Holland. This is not the usual case for Jury of the Yard, in fact it is not his case. It's his lady friend who is the suspect. A really good mystery that will keep you guessing until the last page."
2,Nonsensical Pieces Dropped like Confetti,"Oy vey! This is my first--and last--Martha Grimes. No respect for forensics. Tedious characters (the Scotland Yard guy hires an illiterate numbskull with illegible handwriting for his sectretary!). A whole chapter on arcane antiques that does nothing for what bits and flotsam of plot there may be.And that's the main trouble with this book. Instead of a straight forward telling of a story, we have tiny bread crumbs of story scattered all over the place. Key information for solving the crime (was the victim killed where she was found or elsewhere?) is withheld and amiable chitchat substituted. What's worse, if you soldier thru to the end (I didn't; my husband told me the ending), the method of the first murder is truly impossible.UGH!"
1,I did not reconize the characters in this latest Jury novel.,"The names are the same in the Richard Jury series,but the personalities are so different in the previous books. I have read all of the books in the series and I think Ms. Grimes needs to kill off most of the characters and start a new series."
1,Not worth reading!,I have read all of the Inspector Jury novels and enjoyed each of them. Not so with this last. The writing was weak from beginning to middle (where I finally had had enough and put it aside). I am still hoping that the next book might revive the previously memorable characters to their former readable selves. I won't make the same mistake though and buy the book but will wait to get it from the library!
4,Good fit,"These dropped right into an '86 Caprice Classic Wagon. They did lift the back end by and inch or two, but since it was a little low anyway, no harm. Not a real significant change in ride quality. I'd buy these again in a second."
2,Bad Sound.,"I was hopeful that this would solve a lack of RCA on my TV but so far it's just caused another problem, sound quality.Instead of not being able to watch to inputs on one TV through a RCA splitter, it has made normal TV hard to watch do to reduced sound volume and a constant electronic buzzing.I'm not sure where to go from here. I guess i might try a more expensive splitter, maybe a powered one.This might be a one off situation where the TV is the cause but for me it's still an issue I thought that people should be aware of.On the positive side the video has not suffered."
4,Pyramid RY6 1 Male to 2 Female RCA Adaptor,"This product is number one cheap and second works! i paid two bucks with free shipping. i am using it to make my 2.1 speaker system into a 3.1 and so far it works great no complains. if i do, i'll come back and edit this comment."
5,"Our Home is in ""Brigadoon""","We love the color version of this movie. I didn't know that Van Johnson could dance like that. The story is wonderful and we also purchased the music book for ""Brigadoon""."
5,Zombies are the heroes and I love it.,"I love this game. You don't have to be lighting fast to play it and you get unlimited lives. Each time you fail on a level, you get to start that level over. I would recomend it. 5 stars from me"
3,"fiction,but true","'Point Man' writes from experience. Although this is 'fiction', he has 'been there, done that' and knows what he's talking about. Might be a little confusing, but so is combat, esp. close quarters combat! There are many authors who claim to write 'true' books, but how many do you know who write 'fiction' that's from REAL EXPERIENCE? Good reading...ENJOY! Also, check out his Non-Fiction books! ""Point Man"" & ""Walking Point"" to read the true stories!"
3,Nice info poor photography,"The content of the book is suerb in terms of the breadth of the information and the geographical coverage in a territory as rich and complex as Greece. Sadly the wuality of the printing leaves a lot to be desired. The phtos are nice but the printing makes them look old and almost newspaper quality. There are gorgeous books on Greece and the images here don't do justice to the place. If you are looking for info and to have a general idea of the beauty of Greek villages, this is a good choice. If you want to see beautiful images of Greece, look for the books by Nikos Desyllas or George Meis."
1,Bad review DON'T BUY,"I didn't not receive the purple elephant, but instead a brown monkey??? I understand it said colors vary, but I receive a completely different animal!!!! My yorkie has the purple elephant from years ago and is getting old and ripped, she has a major attachment to it and I wanted to get her a knew one! I was VERY disappointed when it came in the mail. It was a WASTE of 5$!!"
3,pontiac gto fuel filter,"hastings fuel filter for a 2004 pontiac GTO won't work on this vehicle because it doesn't have an external filter,found this out after the fact, so its now a piece of art in my garage."
1,Now only available from one source...,"The ULTRA AAA Battery Pack, that lets you use your mouse using (3) AAA's, either regular or rechargeable. You no longer need the base charger!It is exactly the same as the GP 4102 battery now in your mouse, except you put (3) AAA's inside it. [...] - I recently bought this and it works great!)"
5,A trip back to Bradley's,Mayes and Drummond were regularly featured on the Bradley's calendar and represent the heart and soul of the style of music you would hear in the historic University Place saloon. The format for music that Bradley Cunningham established was simple - a good piano player and a good base player - because that was the style of jazz he enjoyed the most. He built the room around the music and you would often find him at Table #1 listening to the great players. This CD is pure pleasure for me and brings back many fun times sitting with my uncle Bradley at Table #1.
1,Awful,"Almost pointless video. The majority of the time they discuss investing down in the keys or Florida, this video was obviously made during the real estate boom in Florida, I can now see why Florida is in so much trouble. Anytime you have ""real estate investors"" like these people you're bound to create problems. No information on multi family."
1,Not for outside the USA,Very extensive and useful information for investments within the USA but does no bring anything to you if you are diversifying outside the US borders...
3,Good while it lasted,"It had pretty good control for location, distance, and timing so I was happy with it. It shot water with such force that I had to weigh it down sometimes to keep it from moving and accidentally watering the pavement.After a while, some part in the sprinkler head malfunctioned a bit, causing it to spray a little mist and weaken the main stream. It still worked well enough that I didn't mind.The sprinkler finally busted on the bottom of the timer portion. I read you have to keep the sprinkler from freezing so maybe I happened to leave it out one night when the temp dropped or something. If you're worried about that, you might want to go purchase a metal sprinkler like I did.I couldn't find one with a built-in timer so I just bought the timer separately. Not a bad thing because there are more options if you're interested in programmable timers."
1,It doesn't work,i purchased two units. I began using one and was maintaining the second unit as a spare. My son had his yard reseeded and browwed the spare unit. The timer does not work on the second unit whch I would not have known had I not lent it out.i
2,Gilmour sprinkler,"Unfortunately, the product we ordered from the picture shown was not the product we received. I was very disappointed but assumed that it was a replacement for the actual item ordered. I do not like it near as well as the 993TD impulse sprinkler we ordered. I would be hesitant to order again."
1,"New out of the box, won't rotate","Like another reviewer mentioned, it just won't rotate at any PSI, and or will start rotating and then get stuck. Unit was new out of the box, so give it one star for this one little flaw. Construction is flimsy, it's made entirely of plastic and looks like it could start falling apart at any time... Do not recommend."
4,Makes manual watering tolerable,"My criticisms:Directions could be more comprehensive (for those of us mechanically challenged)The vendor included a note that the item was not returnable and to call them if you had any issues. The most offensive aspect of that policy is that I was not made aware of that policy BEFORE I purchased the item. That needs to be made PUBLIC knowledge...upfrontNow, once I spent time with the sprinkler and fooled around with all the knobs and learned all of its many capabilities I am pleased with the product. Like I said if you don't have the luxury of an automatic sprinkler system this one is very good. Having a timer and being able to choose the size of watering areas makes me feel much less wasteful....and I live in the desert."
2,Disappointed.....,"I agree with the review about the directions which are vague to say the least. Maybe my water pressure is too low for this sprinkler, I am a novice gardener after all. It justrefuses to rotate and stays in one spot. I have played around with it for hours, getting wet and frustrated. I get it set up perfectly, leave, and when I look out the window 15 min. later it is stuck in one spot. I gave up and bought one of those hoses with holes in it. I give up on sprinklers."
4,Not Bad. A Little Slow.,"Decent game, good graphics, but it becomes a little tedious and slow sometimes. I'd like more 1 round choices, rather than having to play 10+ hours to complete an around the world tour."
2,"Too much opinion, not enough fact","Interesting book. Got it a few years ago when I was obsessed with Prophetic and End Times books. But seriously, nothing he really says can be backed up. It's mostly a bunch of opinion. If you want a good assessment of the book of revelation, Dr. Jeannie Constantinou has an excellent podcast that sadly she hasn't finished, but gives a great foundation.[...]"
2,Disappointed,It is a great idea - but not for the IPOD nano. I find the description misleading. It implied it would recharge the nano but the truth is you must use an audio cable to connect the nano and it will not recharge. From the limited pictures and data I couldn't tell if it would fit either of my cars and as it turned out it wouldn't. I returned it thinking I was missing an adapter. Turns out I wasn't.
2,Wireless car receiver,".... did not meet my expectations. The item is bulky, so in some cars it does not even fit into the power plug. The item is too big to be plugged in and stay clear away from the shifter or parking brake.During everyday driving, the sound being transmitted is not loud enough. You have to crank the stereo up to hear it half way. The analog display is invisible in daylight... so no way to see what station you have to set it in. Also, don't forget to remove the ipod once the car is off. It will drain the ipod out of power.I would not recommend this product. It is way too big for the console...unless you have an SUV or enough space in between shifter and dash."
3,Good!,Product is just as described. Very light. fits in most jacks that are not covered by hanging dashes. so if you have a plug on the bottom try to find another one in your vehicle. Works great!
1,Do Not Buy,I was given a CTA transmitter over two years ago and it worked great.When it stopped working I ordered another. It lasted only 3 weeks then crapped out. Returned for another and this one lasted only 2 weeks. I am now getting my money refunded and will buy another brand.
3,Nona Dearth's Families Helping Families,I was doing a research paper on the subject of schizophrenia when I stumbled on Nona Dearth's book. It was a great help in learning more about the severe mental illness. It was very interesting and had a lot of important facts on the disease even though it is an older book. I thouroughly enjoyed it and learned many interesting facts. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more abou the topic of schizophrenia and it would be an especially good read for anyone that is close or related to a schizophrenic.
1,Rev. is a total waste of money -- don't purchase!!!,This show is really offensive to Christians -- crude humor. Not an accurate characterization of Pastors or Priests. I'm sorry I paid money for this .... it's just not worth it so don't waste your dollars!
3,Just gives you a taste of Builder and Windows Programming,"Only chapters 5 through 8 were truly useful in that they showed the basics of Builder. Other than that, there is no clear and documented information about the Windows Classes, Functions and Methods. I guess this book is good if you need to learn about database programming cause the book spends about a week on it. Get another book as a reference if you intend to get this one."
3,It's nice for learning how to use the C++ Builder IDE,"Maybe for new programmers, they will find that the book is really good. For me.. I consider that it is not enough the material for the average to experienced programmer. There are some errors in some of the source code examples (you can not imagine the trouble that i passed). The database chapter is just a breeze overview without good examples. Just small routines. I had to ask at the Borland C++ Builder Newsgroups to learn to do trivial things, like converting from AnsiString to char for example, and learning to put an icon at the MessageBox. The VCL explanation about what it is is excellent, but there is not too much code about how to deal withit. If you are a beginner you will find it very interesting"
3,Decent,"This book is good if your a beginner. It does go into some advanced stuff, but there are no real code examples. You would be better off using the builder help files."
5,Very well written book on C++ Builder,"I read the entire book except the chapter on DLL's. Very well written. Explains usage of BCB very well. I was a C programmer when I started this book. Also started reading a Book on Ansi C++ at same time and now I feel confortable programming in C++ using BCB. Some reviewers here have knocked it for some errors. There are some, not many, and when stumped compiling one of the examples, you can always load the example from the CDROM which will compile. In summary, how else can you teach someone BCB other than a ""Learn it in 21 days"" approach. This book should be included with each copy of the BCB software."
1,No included CD,I ordered this learn builder IDE in C++. The used book was in good condition but the 60 trial Builder cd was taken off.
1,"Too basic. If you can click a mouse, don't buy it.","Everything in this book is found in the Borland Builder help files. If you know how to click a mouse, save your money.I wish I had read these reviews before buying it."
2,"Nice Overview, but I still can't program crap...","I bought this book without ever programming, but a little on appleII's. I wanted more code explained. I thought it did a nice job of explaining the Builder itself, but how to actually use code within the brackets was severely lacking. It would just say, ""Here's how you drop the components onto your form... and then just type in your code..."" So, I bought another book on the basics of C++ which is awesome for console programming, but I am still having a hard time crossing this knowledge to the Visual environment. So, I need to buy yet another book to help me understand this compiler.....<sigh>"
3,kairodark (developer and reverse engineer),"I've found the compiler documentation to be inadiquate, so I got this book to hopefully help out. It's well written and covers a lot of useful information, however this book is best suited for newbies. It is not at all suited for advanced programmers, but is more than adequate for those just beginning."
3,"Good beginning, but leaves you without practical knowledge","This book was a good overview, but leaves you with a lot of questions in the end. The title turned out to be misleading as well, since I read it and understood it in a couple of days, not twenty-one.To summarize, the book was a good introduction to visual programming, and the visual aspect of Borland C++ Builder, but did not discuss any practical applications in any depth. I found that it discussed a lot of how to ""drag here, click here, enter your code here"", but did not cover on what code you could put and where.I also found it somewhat lacking in covering the VCL and Events. For example, the book covered on the fact that you could create drag-and-drop events, but not how.A good beginners book, but I felt it belonged more in the ""For Dummies"" series than in the TYI21D's series."
5,Great beginner's book,"This book covers the basics of control circuits without bogging down in the more advanced theory not needed at this level.The text and drawings are clear and simple, and cover ladder diagrams, jog/run switches, limit switches, foot switches, temperature, 3 way, 4 way, bimetallic, motor starters, etc. All kinds of faults and failures are covered.Recommended for learning the basics fast. You can pick up the design theory after you have a grasp of the concepts."
2,Not for Practical Purposes,"I was hoping that this book would offer insights into the fiscal impact of development on municipalities. It doesn't. This book uses national level data to estimate the costs associated with urban expansion versus urban containment. This is an important aspect of regional sprawl, but it ignores the financial cost implications of different types of development forms. There is no discussion of how municipal costs vary with different residential densities or by land use category."
5,The Best of Thom Rotella,"This one of the best acoustic guitar jazz albums I have heard....and the best of Thom Rotella's albums. I also love his ""Thom Rotella Band,"" ""Can't Stop,"" and ""Without Words"" but feel that ""Home Again"" is even better. If you like the other Rotella albums just mentioned....or the music of jazz guitarist Peter White....you will love ""Home Again."""
5,Buried Treasure!!!!,"I think 10 years from now somebody is going to discover this recording, then a loyal cult following will develop, then college classes will follow... Recorded in 1992, this jazz CD is more hip than most things coming out now. Randy Brecker with 5 lesser known equals on this far out acid jazz jam fest create the most exciting and intriguing rythms and sounds. How the tunes seemly disintegrate into free jazz and then in an instant regroup into melodic fusion formation is just amazing fun. You'll kick yourself if you don't get a copy before this becomes a collectors item."
5,This album is TIGHT,"Sicx's ""If These Walls Could Talk"" is an AWESOME disc; too good to be put into words. The tracks on this cd are very dark-sounding (not like his first album, ""Dead 4 Life"") and, of course, his subject matter is just as dark. This is definately not something you bump at a party for the ladies, rather, I suggest you listen to it alone, at night and in a dark room sippin' on a forty of Olde English. In my personal opinion, Sicx's duet with Loki on the track ""On One"" is phenomenal and captures so much emotion, the type of emotion that I know we all experienced before. All in all, a masterpiece."
1,Cute but Boring,"This young woman has a fine coloratura soprano voice, albeit a little underpowered, but she simply has no understanding of musical architecture. There is too much emphasis on virtuosic technique and no regard at all for musical subtleties. In fact, I suspect the only reason this little filly was favored over so many of her betters is that she looks mighty tasty in that skimpy frock and short-shorts. Once again, sex sells and the vox vulgus dominates at the expense of true art."
2,Hope you like unwrapping CD's!!!,"You're gonna have to like assembly work. The product comes in a ridiculous number of pieces and has inaccurate/poor instructions. The mushroom alone comes in seven pieces, all shrunk wrapped and has eighteen nuts & bolts. The shrink wrap takes 1 hour to remove and the rest of the assembly another 45 minutes. The whole thing takes 2 hours of competent handyman time. ..."
1,This wasn't even available,"After two weeks, I never rec'd my items and when I e-mailed to ask where they were, the supplier informed me that they longer exist. He tried to compensate by asking what he could do to provide a good review for the company but didn't mention anything about satisfying the customer...just what he could do to help the company look better and get more business.Don't purchase from this company..."
3,Pretty but Large and Gets Larger,"The first time I wore this, the so-called medium size fit more like a large - I could still wear it but I would have been more satisfied with a small (even though I usually wear a medium/large in VS lingerie, for instance). But then after I started washing it, it just kept getting bigger and bigger. The elastic does not keep its shape at all. Luckily, it was cheap enough that I got a couple decent uses out of it, but I would definitely buy a size smaller than I usually wear.Also, unless you have some supporting tape or something, your boobs are not going to look as good as the model's. But that's to be expected, I think."
3,Not that bad!,"Okay, I know I'm in the minority here, but I honestly didn't think the movie was that bad. Maybe I just had low expectations. Don't get me wrong. This is definitely not the best movie ever, but I don't think it is the worst either. Yes, the acting is amateurish and some of the camera work is awful, but I thought the overall story line was interesting and some of the death scenes were cleverly staged. It reminded me a lot of some of David DeCouteau's films with its subtle (and not so subtle) hints of homosexuality and gratuitious shirtless guys. If you have a good sense of humor and don't expect too much, this film is worth viewing."
2,Very disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this movie and I love B horror flicks. I thought this was a rip off rendition of Friday the 13th. It is held in a summer camp, come on, with teenagers that scream, please. The idea of the plot was a good one, but executed very wrong. If you want to see a summer camp movie, see Friday the 13th series."
2,matt dallas fan,I bought this movie because I'm a Matt Dallas fan. I've seen clips of it before. I thought it would be good. It wasn't that good like I expected.
5,Sleepaway Camp meets Groundhog Day!,"YES, this movie is cheesy, but it's supposed to be! I totally loved it...but I also loved Sleepaway Camp! It's too funny to really worry about ""why"" they repeat the same day over and over!!! If your really anal about poor transitions and bad sound effects, you'll hate it, but it's a spoof of cheesy 80s horror movies, and the Groundhog Day effect gives it a unique twist that I've never seen done in a horror film before!Sleepaway Camp meets Groundhog Day!!!Mmmmwwwaaahahaha!!!"
3,B-rated at it's finest,"Okay, Im going to admit first off, that the only reason I got this movie in the first place was because of Matt Dallas being in it. I was a big fan of Kyle XY and wanted to see some of his other work. Well he definitely came a long way after this movie. This movie is by no means great or extremely entertaining. But if you're looking for a goofy, non-acting, friday the 13th rip-off, with a bland Sixth Sense feel thrown in, then this is the movie to watch. It's definitely extremely evident that it is a VERY cheap production. But as an aspiring filmmaker myself I can't knock the producers and everyone for trying to make a movie. Everybody's visions are different when it comes to these things. This however probably needed just a little more tweaking before they decided to move forward. But it is what it is."
1,Reads like a sales pitch.,"This book reads like a sales pitch for the author's favorite pet projects, which clearly are NOT related to real software engineering projects of any sort.It, without any justification, throws the reader into a whirlwind of nonsensical terminology ; and renders itself useless in absence of other resources for understanding LTSA, FSP, etc etc .... This book is almost a scam.No real mention of how the modern concurrency API in java relates to these concepts."
1,Who needs all the pages?,"I was very annoyed with this purchase. I received a product that one had the cover put on backwards and then two was missing pages. Page 125, blank page, 127. mmm to bad the teacher said the answer was on page 126. And its not that its one or two pages, it is several pages (at least 25) throughout the book.First problem I have had with amazon, but its a big one. Waste of my money to purchase an incomplete book."
5,extremely useful for understanding concurrency issues,"It was only after reading that book that I was able to really understand the conecepts of interleaved actions, race conditions, semaphores and monitors (as well as other concurrency-related issues). As a newcomer to IT generally, reading this book enabled me to understand better the Operating Systems course at Imperial College. I think the reading of this book should precede any approach to a course on operating systems. As a final note, Jeff Kramer is one of the most popular lecturers at the department of computing of Imperial College. Many other studens I spoke too were convinced that his teaching was by far the most efficient. I strongly recommend the book! I still use it at work as an ever useful reference."
3,Corny,"I watched this in fits and starts, so maybe if I had watched it all the way through it may have been better. But the only thing I really have to say is that this is corny. The dialogue is predictable and strained. But, the plot did have a few twists, so that was one plus. I only bought this because I had a free video credit to use and I was looking for something with actors that I like."
3,Not Worth It,"I really don't think this game is worth buying. For one main reason, you cannot use your saved games from RCT1 which just doesn't seem right and secondly, there aren't very many scenarios. The graphics do however look better and the game runs more smoothly. I like the new themes as well, but it isn't much fun if you can't use the old scenarios and saved games from RCT1. If anyone found a way to use your saved games and old scenarios, then email me please!"
2,This is not really a sequel,"Don't buy this game if you're looking for a totally updated version. It's not. Its really just an expansion pack -- a good one (unlike loopy landscapes and the other one which didn't really add much). I really think that you shouldn't label a game part 2 unless you completely redo the interface, plot or some other MAJOR part of the game. This was just some nice add ons and tweaking."
4,Great Game,"This is a better Rollercoaster Tycoon than the origional. You don't have to delete the trees before you build something, and the set up of the game itself is better."
3,A little disappointed...,"I am a really big fan of RCT1 and all of it's expansion packs. I play for hours on end. I was very excited about the new RCT2 coming out, however now I am now disappointed. RCT2 was not necessary for what they did to it or didn't do to it. It might as well have been another expansion pack for RCT1. I played for it for about two weeks (giving it a shot) but I am back to RCT1, it's a much better product!"
2,A Step in the Wrong Direction,"No matter how hard I try, I can't play RCT2 more than 15 minutes before switching back to the original RCT and its' expansion games. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this was a pre-version of the original RCT. Despite having a PC with well beyond the system requirements, RCT2 is slow to load and save games, the graphics quality doesn't look as good as the original, and overall, there's no major new features- more like modifications, and I've encountered a couple of bugs. It's really disappointing that a this game doesn't stand up to it's 4-year old predecessor which I still love to play."
2,hate the interface,Frustrating game. Guess i lack the patience. I dont like theway the interface works though. Too hard to correct design mistakes and not very intuitive. I like the way zoo tycoon with its add ons of dinosaurs and marine animals works much better.Seemed a lot more fun creating interesting designs for your tiger habitat then trying to make this track line up with that track.
4,RTC2 Fun but the Same,RTC2 is fun but the same as RCT1. It is an expansion just with a few new features. The new rides/attractions are awesome. But the scenerios are the same as the first. If you had RCT1 then it will be fun until you start getting to the old stuff.
5,"Bravo, Bravo!","If you are even mildly interest in simuation games, or maybe even theme parks you will LOVE this game. That is no exaggeration. Roller Coaster Tycoon will provide you with hours of entertainment with its wild and endless scenarios, hundreds of rides, themes, and the general idea of money-making and the various problems that come with it. I HIGHLY recommend this game! YOU WILL **LOVE** IT!"
5,Lots of fun,"More of everything. More fun. If you liked the orginal you will love this. You can create your own park scenario, you choose the size, the rides available etc. Terrific."
3,A Discourse on RCT2,"RCT2 was on of the first computer games that I was hooked on. I have in the past five years switched to primarily playing X-Box 360 games for the speed of the console and virtually non-existant set-up time. This game, however, brought me back to the golden years of computer gaming.RCT2 does not have great graphics, music, interactivity, or playability for extended periods of time. It makes up for this in nearly complete freedom to build and design a theme park. The re-playability more than compensates for its lack in the aforementioned categories.Over all: ***"
5,Best game in the world,"Roller coaster tycoon2 is great.You have more than 15 new roller coasters.Plus did I mention that they have X from sixflags magic mountan,and Goliath from sixflags magic mountain.You have to get atleast 5,600 guest in your park with a rating of 800.Remember to keep your guest happy or else your park will be closed down.You may have played the first roller coaster tycoon,but this is the ultimate roller coaster tycoon game.From a roller coaster expert."
5,R.C.T 2 Rocks!,"This game is super fun. I like making my own levels and building the craziest and best rollercoasters.There are so many different types of rollercoasters. I've had Rollercoaster Tycoon for at least 2 or 3 years and I still enjoy playing it. One of my levels has $500,000!:)Best game ever:)"
3,Roller Coaster Tycoon is the best game!!,"I still think the first Roller Coaster Tycoon is the best!! But this game is good too, just have to used to to playing it, a little different layout from the first Roller Coaster Tycoon game!"
2,Don't bother,Nothing really new. The First one was better. Just new items thats it. The same sounds from the original. And yes if that freakin kid still whines from the first one. Wait for the 3rd version to come out! Save your money!The only thing cool is the new 6 flags rollercoasters. Gets old quickly
5,This game ROCKS,"My brother got this for Christmas. Eventually one day I was really bored (yes, bored enough to watch teletubbies or clean the toilet) and started playing it. It did not take me long to figure it out. You can change the name of your park, which I did right away. I added all this crazy music to my rides and gave my rides and stalls the strangest names. But enough about me-- lets talk about you, as a buyer. This is a great game to play when your bored enough to watch teletubbies or clean the toilet (more fun too). You can build a normal old park and take it seriously, or you can go absolutely CRAZY!!! (you can drown people, hopefully by accident, put music on every ride, make underground rollercoasters, etc.) I would most defenetly NOT recommend this for children under 9. It can get confusing."
4,Great game....but...,"I LOVE both RCT 1 and 2, but I am so sick of playing for objectives. There should be different versions because sometimes I just want to build a park. I want to build a park without financial restriction and objective restriction. There should be two modes: fun mode and tycoon mode. It would be sooo much better. I don't really care about the tycoon part. I'm just sick of building a park and then it gets shut down, and I have no guests, but I have this amazing park. Two modes would be SO MUCH BETTER!"
2,Same As The First One,"I wouldent say this is the best game because its the same one as roller coaster tycoon 1.The only diffrence in roller coaster tycoon 2 is that there is more things to build, and different levels.Im not going to say ""Dont buy it"" im just going to say ""If you have Roller Coaster Tycoon 1, dont buy the secound one, because its the same"".""But if you dont have Roller Coaster Tycoon 1, or 2, then buy the secound one, or buy the expension pack wich is better"".I hope this was helppful to you. :-)"
3,Average Game,"Not nearly as good as the first one; this game has a lot of problems. For instance, If you make a roller coaster, either its way too intense for the parkers ( people in park ) to ride on, or way too boring. This game is called RCT to RIDE rides, right? Well, you can't make your own roller coaster to have people go on it. To make people want to ride your coasters you have to make a premade one. I hate premades; i like to make them myselves. Anyways, this game had potential, but it didn't do what it was intended. A lot of cool new stands and landscapes and rides, but it seems that this game was rushed. Stick with the original, or get RCT3 maybe. ( I havent played that game personally, but it looks cool. )"
2,Sad,"This is something you would find in an expansion. This game does not have the right to be called Roller Coaster tycoon. The graphics are dated and are starting to wear off. I was hoping for 3D rides and so much more. This should be called ""Roller Coaster Tycoon: Six Flags expansion pack""."
1,Copied Game,"The Game is great! I haven't played it in years, but it's always nice to play:D However, THIS game is copied so you have a different menu and the CD looks quite fake."
3,happy yet dissapointed,i like the game but it seems that this should have been an update not a new edition. with that said i like the new tools editor so that i can discover all of the avaiable booths and rides. the colors revert back to strange colors on my system but maybe i should go to the website and download a patch i dunno but it is definately not true colors. i dont like that the predesigned rides come with scenery and que lines so when i make a mistake and have to demolish the ride i end up spending 2 or 3 minutes to delete the que lines and scenery that came with it
3,Solid fun but too much like the original,"RCT2 is definitely fun but too much of the original game crept in to this sequel. It's really more like an expansion pack than a sequel. If you were looking for something novel and new, this is not it. Think of it as more of a polished version. It will look and feel very familiar with few twists and changes. I'm enjoying it but not thrilled by it. The excitement that the original RCT brought is not in this game. RCT2 just smacks of expansion packs to come. I would give a solid 3 out of 5 stars.If you don't have any of the RCT games, I would buy the RCT Gold ahead of this one. You will get much more bang for your buck plus there are tons of add-on's to download from the internet."
2,Rollercoaster Tycoon 2,I think this is an ok game. All the Rollercoasters are so extreme no one will go on them. There is never enough money either. I would not reccomend this game if you want to have a great time.
5,For all Roller Coaster Fans!!!,"If you are a rollercoaster fan, you will love RollerCoaster Tycoon. For me this game is one of the best out there. And now RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 is coming out!!!! Can you imagine how great this game is going to be!?! If you loved RollerCoaster tycoon...I don't need to say anymore. Watch some screenshots of the new game here: http://www.chrissawyer.com/feature5.htm"
5,RCT 2 Is The Funnest Game On The Planet!!!,RCT 2 is the funnest game I have played since the Original RCTs. It diserves full ratings!
1,"Awful, just awful","I've never played so a boring game in my life. I'd rather play some other bad game like WarCraft 3 than this stuff. I almost fell asleep during the first park, and passed out while trying to beat the second one. I drank some coffee and but that won't help when playing this game. This game has a negative effect on caffine and actually negates it. If you hate your life and want to find something to make it worse play this game!!"
5,Yay,"Hello,its mehello,its mehello,its mehello,its mehello,its mehello,its mehello,its mehello,its mehello,its mehello,its mehello,its mehello,its me,NOW SHUT YOUR FLAMING GOB!"
5,you have to go to scenario designer,you have to go to scenario designer.and go to admission settup.and select if you want people to pay the price to enter the park or for people to pay to ride the rides.
1,Disappointment,"If you like to build roller coasters and scenarios, buy this game. If you just like to play the scenarios and expect to see anything like Roller Coaster Tycoon, don't bother. There aren't extra parks that you open after completing scenarios (which was the gamers reward). And there is too much emphasis on playing the 6-Flags Parks (I guess they must have helped to fund this). Chris Sawyer should have stuck with his original concept and just made an add-on for those obsessive enthusiasts who like to create scenarios. Waste of money for a true gamer."
2,More of the same,"This game should have been a cheaper expansion, not a new 29.99 game. The game play is almost identicle to the first RCT. There is not much difference between RCT and RCT2 except for the Six Flags rollercoasters. The game was a real disappoinment for me."
4,RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 review,Roller Coaster tycoon 2 is one of my favorite simulation games. I think the 2nd version is better then the 1st. The game arrived in a timely manner. It had no scratches. It was in perfect condition. If you like tycoon games or the sims this may be a game for you.
4,Enjoyable,"Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 is not the fanciest game out there. It's not the most intense of intellectually challenging either. But it is a solid game with decent value and replay value. In essence, it's a classic that I think builds nicely on the first Roller Coaster Tycoon."
4,entertaining,"My 9 year old Daughter has Zoo Tycoon and loves it. She told me about Rollercoaster Tycoon that her friend has played and said she really wanted it. So I went online, received it in just 2 days, she was so excited. The first night she played I could not get her off the computer. She really enjoys playing and likes that she can create her own rollercoaster park. Great Price for product!"
3,Great Theme Park Game,This game is pretty fun if you have time to sit down and play on the computer for hours. You need to actually play for a couple hours to complete the levels but if you have this time the game is a blast. Cool rides and lots of excitement.
2,Disappointing Sequel,"You've heard it before and you're going to hear it again. While there have been additions to this game, the designer, in a curious move has also taken away some key features. Rather than yammering endlessly about the nuances of the game, here is the breakdown:PROSMore ridesMore themesMore shops/stallsAbility to save rides with scenerySix Flags parksCONSScant amount of theming objects for each themeFewer pathway and railing selectionsLand smoothing tool omitted from regular gamingPoor representation of Six Flags parksLIMITED scenario editor"
4,Almost like an expansion of the original,"RCT 2 is basically the original RCT with more rides to build and different parks. The visual and audio aspects of the games are exactly the same, and if one did not know any better, one could mistake RCT 2 as an expansion of RCT 1. Even though RCT 2 doesn't really bring anything new to the table, it is still a great game and I recomend it."
4,"Good, but be careful","I loved this game, but a couple of days ago, when I was installing it on my new computer, I heard a popping noise. I open the disc tray to find out that my disc had shattered into peices, with some of them IN my computer. Now my dad has to take my computer apart and take the peices out. If it did major dameges, I am going to have to get a totally new computer AND buy another copy and hope it dosen't break. It is a good game, just not good enough for a hammer. ( But then again, no game is.)"
1,It sucks,"I do not like Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. The scenarios are way too hard and I don't like the music on the main menu; it's sad which doesn't fit the game. The scenarios strike me as weird (I don't know why).The bottom line is, don't get this game. Get the 1st or the 3rd Roller Coaster Tycoon this game is a waste of your money! The 1st is better because the scenarios are nicer than the 2nd or 3rd. The 3rd is better because of the amazing graphics.I don't think my opinion is very reliable, because many others think it is a great game. So this review will probably be ignored. Whatever!"
3,Okay,"I thought this game was okay. Rollercoaster Tycoon was pretty fun, but this game got old and tiring to quickly. I mean, it's almost the exact same game as Rollercoaster Tycoon 1. You have the same objectives and it's just not that fun. I was a huge fan of Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 when it came out, but then it just wasn't fun anymore. This game was not anywhere near as good as the first one."
3,What?!?!,"Chris? How could you do this to us? You abandoned Hasbro for this? Three beginners courses? Confusing tools? Well, I guess you did good on the coaster designer and scenario designer, but this is ridiculous. Anyone reading this article, please, buy Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 and the expansions before you buy this! This game is basiccly just an expansion!"
4,Great Game,This kids love this game. Makes them think in business terms - got to have a park that makes money!
4,I'm Addicted Already!,"This game is great although it is not an advancement over the old game. It plays exactly like the old. It is neat how all the scenarios are visible. You don't have to beat one to get a hidden one. There is also a scenario editor and a coaster editor. The coaster editor though was obviously created to stand up against Disney's Ultimate Ride. While it is great that there is a scenario editor a little more free form would be nice. You can't build things like houses and place buildings like there are in some of the scenarios. All you can really do is decide where you want your entrance to be, how much land you want to own, and lay out roads. All in all, though, this is a fabulous package for any fan of Rollercoaster Tycoon!"
2,A Step in the Wrong Direction,"No matter how hard I try, I can't play RCT2 more than 15 minutes before switching back to the original RCT and its' expansion games. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this was a pre-version of the original RCT. Despite having a PC with well beyond the system requirements, RCT2 is slow to load and save games, the graphics quality doesn't look as good as the original, and overall, there's no major new features- more like modifications, and I've encountered a couple of bugs. It's really disappointing that this game doesn't stand up to it's 4-year old predecessor which I still love to play."
5,Simply the Best,"Theres not much that hasnt been said-Great Graphics, Gameplay and In my opnion it got a whole lot better then the original version. In the Six Flags version, it unlocks lots and lots of rides that would take a long time to get in the original. Also (my favorite feature) you dont have to unlock one level to get to the next...if you want easy its there...if you want hard its there...I think the 2 best features are 1. That the levels arent locked and 2. More rides! This is the ultimate for the tycoon fan. Randy"
3,"Good, but not the first.","Not enough of a difference from the first one. It was fun, but [a higher costing]... upgrade for little features from the first. If you can find Rollercoaster tycoon Gold for cheaper, then you are good to go. If not, than this is good."
3,"Fun, but disapointing","I am a major RCT junkie, but i am a bit dissapointed with RCT2. It is a fun game, but it doesn't feature many improvments from the origional (and there were a lot of things that could have used some improving). The graphics are the same, the handymen are just as stupid and still get stuck, you can still only view from 4 different angles, and they removed the ability to play it in a window on you desktop (or at least I havn't seen how yet).On the plus side, they've added some new rides, new shops, and new ways of adding scenery. One nice feature is the ability to build shops/bathrooms above another path or water.Overall, this is a fun game (as was the origional). But don't expect too many new and exciting features. This game is really more like an expansion to the origional RCT. But hey, for $22 I guess I can't complain"
5,Taking a Corkscrew in the Bussiness,"If you ever wanted to feel like you have a theme park?Keep reading if you want to.I recomend the best computer game in the world,Rollercoaster Tycoon.You can create over 60 rides,12 themes for your park,and choose from over 20 levels.If your not up to this challenge,try working in a section of Six Flags.Hire staff,and take a peek on what your guests are thinking.Tis is definetly a must buy.:)"
4,Fun game...but......,"Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 is a lot of fun! You can add pre-built roller coasters and rides, food stands, resturants, gift shops, plants, lakes, and even build your own roller coaster which is lots of fun!The only negative thing about it is that the people that go to your park don't look very realistic -- there are too many twins -- almost all of them look exactly alike, which is not much fun. Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 might be more realistic."
4,RollerCoaster Tycoon 2,"I have owned this game for a long time and still find joy playing it. This game is realistic might I add. It costs mmoney to tear down trees! But realistic can sometimes be better. You can select playing on an already made park, or a real six flags park. There are six flag's rides you can buy throughout the game too. Basically what you do is buy a piece of land, have an objective, an then start building a park with rollercoasters, food places, merry-go-rounds, and a whole lot of other stuff. As you go on through the game you can buy more varied types of rollercoasters and more scenery. This game, in my view, is a must have!"
2,"Good (but repetative) Gameplay, Terrible Graphics","This game has basically Good (but repetative) Gameplay, Terrible Graphics."
2,Dominoes not good,"Dominoes were shipped on time, however the quality of the domino is very bad. Some are cracked and were put back together others are warped and curved. They don't stand up well. Not a good buy. I should have went for the more expensive and higher quality type domino. These are wood, I really like the synthetic ones better."
1,For the price....you get what you pay for.,"Most of the dominoes are misshapen and of different sizes. The paint peels off of them fairly easy as well. I didn't expect too much when I bought them, but I at least thought the dominoes would all be rectangular and of a similar size to each other. I will not buy these again."
4,Great for kids,"Bought for my 4.5 yr old and he now loves the game of dominos, and also to set them up in tracks and watch them fall down, and also to build towers. Great learning toy for math, dexterity and imagination."
2,They are dominoes.,"I can't fault the advertising, they are double-nine dominoes, and they are wood. They are also very small, about half as big as what I would consider normal dominoes. Not what I was expecting, somewhat disappointed."
3,Brilliant but uneven,"Mortal Kombat is well paced and well plotted, even brilliant at times, but wildly uneven. Some of the writing is insightful, powerful and lyrical, some, just cliched. Mortal Kombat depicts a hero's quest for truth in a testosterone-driven world. There are no real women in this book, and even some misogyny as when the author describes yin and yang and says that the yin is that ""which is negative, dark and feminine; the yang was that which was positive, bright and masculine."" Perhaps in some of his many other books, the author manages to create a real woman and write about her with insight. If so, his work would rise above bash and batter to something profound, even astonishing."
4,Excellent original novel,"The story of the book, rescue an amulet and hot drak it was is so awesome, I'dlike to see a seque"
4,At least I remember it was cool...,"I bought this book a few years back, back when I was really into Mortal Kombat. The first movie had just been released, as well as the cartoon, and Mortal Kombat 3. I was excited when I saw this book, so I bought it. To be honest, I thought it was pretty cool, although I was confused by the various contradictions represented here. Scorpion, I thought, was a bad guy, only interested in revenge and not in stopping evil in general. I also thought Shang Tsung was a demon, not a human turned evil, but I could be wrong about that. Lastly, I thought Liu Kang was a Shaolin warrior and not a member of the White Lotus Society (? Sorry if I got it wrong!). Anyways, the story was pretty exciting, though it strayed too far from the previously established MK facts. Actually, I'm sorry I gave the book away."
4,Where is Liu Kang????,"I've always loved Mortal Kombat. It is easily the most violent video game there is. Then I saw the movies. Those were awesome. Low budget, made for men, and a crap load of action. Then I bought this book. The book itself is a very good book. It is very neat to hear the story of how Mortal Kombat was created. But there was one question I had during the entire book: Where is Liu Kang? The book follows the story on Kung Lao(you know, the guy with the hat) instead of Liu Kang? Kung Lao is cool, but I was very disappointed. So don't think the book is bad, because it's not. But Jeff Rovin(the author) got some things wrong with the characters. So just keep this in mind."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen.,"This is the WORST movie ever made. It was soooooo bad that after making the mistake of buying it -thinking it would be like V, or Independence Day-, I ended up ejecting the cd from my dvd, and actually tossing it away to the wastebasket in the middle of the movie. DO NOT BUY, IT REALLY IS THAT BAD!"
1,Annoyed,Odd type of movie. This could have been a lot better. It was not funny enough for a comedy. Not scary enough for horor. The news flashes were annoying.
1,Ugh Mr Bean meets SlumDog AND MAKE IT SIFI,"If you can sit through 20min of some kid Cameraman shooting a non funny Mr Bean in a cubbie maze, the movie will then take you to the slums (Wahoooo I love trashed shacks)The Story line: they want to move the Aliens to some other slum on earth.(and in 10 years no one would have learned the alien language? Like I said Mr bean without the funny)then they find fluid that starts to morf mr bean in to an alien (I had hoped the movie would start at about 45 min in: it did NOT) then there is allot of shooting aliens and people that are blown up with b rated special effects/ graphics. If you can take it, with the mind numbing video, the end has the only 2 minutes of viewable move (you can get these without the wait by watching the trailer if you watch the trailer you have watched the only part of the movie that is worth seeing.If you have not opened the package you might want to get your money back from TRISTAR PICTURES. it is really that bad."
1,Save Your Money,I was looking forward to seeing this when it was released to the Theater. I didn't get to see it until I purchased the DVD. What a pile of crap this movie turned out to be.
4,More likely scenario for First Contact,"This movie starts as some sort of video account of a UN style organization dealing with the relocation of over one million aliens. It is gritty and far more realistic in scope than any other alien film (i.e Independence Day).The movie is so many things at once. Heart wrenching, poignant, and a real look at how we as a culture can become so elitist. This is our history doomed to be repeated as the aliens are relegated to a lesser status because ""we"" don't understand them. It also shows how the heart can change,"
5,District 9 Obsessed,I bought this DVD quite a while ago but it is still my favorite movie. It was shipped quickly and the DVDs are great quality. I watch this movie at least once a week. Thank you!
1,Couldn't sit past the first 10 minutes,I went to see this movie in theatres with my husband and his family and the camera movements were so shakey it made us all sick and we had to leave after the first 10 minutes...What I did see I thought was disgusting...I wouldn't recomend this movie to anyone.
2,This movie was retarded,I really wish the subject matter had been taken more seriously. It could have been a great film. Effects were terrific though.
2,Don't Waste Your time,"The reason I saw this movie was because a friend referred it, I don't know what he was on when he watch it but obviously not in his right mind to suggest watching it. This movie was nothing like I was expecting. First off it was disturbing and out right disgusting, second it made no sense. It never actually explained why the aliens were there , how they even got there, and left you hanging in the end. The movie was really more focused on the main character and his whole situation but didn't really give much insight about the aliens. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 star review instead of a 1 star is because there were pretty funny scenes that were the only entertainment I got out of the movie."
2,dumb !,"Not a very good sci-fi.its kinda gory, but the does not make the interesting.Just wait till its free on cable tv."
3,A Minor Letdown,"This flick was definitely overhyped. I was taken in by the rave reviews it got plus the Oscar nomination for Best Picture(!). This is not the groundbreaking film you would be led to believe. The docu-style filmmaking isn't exactly groundbreaking and it's been done before and better. You might raise an eyebrow when you consider that it was done on a lower budget, $30 million, than your average Hollywood flick but that passes. The Johannesburg locations are certainly exotic. The analogy to apartheid is trite and obvious. This flick certainly isn't in the same league as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or the first two ""Alien"" movies. The best you can say about ""District 9"" is it moves pretty good and keeps your attention throughout. Just don't confuse it as something significant because it certainly is not that."
2,overrated,"I am a big sci fi fan, but this so highly appraised production does not touch my strings.Story is weak and foreseeable, i consider it more a political movie with aliens serving the purpose of more or less legal immigrants and their problems.Also i am not a fan of the way the story is being told.Biggest sci fi deception of the year for me."
4,A prophetic tale,One of the most enjoyable things about district nine is the attention to detail. From the way the aliens look to the shanty town they live in; which was presented in such a realistic way that one's attention was continuously transfixed on the images on the screen. The heroes of the story are both tragic and heroic at the same time and the real question I left the theater wondering is if this was a prophetic tale of how we might treat our first alien visitors? There's little doubt in my mind that the way the corporations where presented in this film was dead on accurate. The acquisition of new and more advanced alien technology would boost any greedy companies' bank account. This movie leaves a lot of questions unanswered at the end; but that is part of the excitement. Were left wondering about the fates of the main characters and will the protost return in three years as promised?
4,Very good until the third act collapse,"The Bottom Line:District 9 does a lot of things right and offers some compelling science-fiction entertainment, so I'm able to forgive the fact that in the last half hour all ideas are thrown out the window in favor of nonstop action and poor characterizations (e.g. the Nigerians who show up so we can have another villain in the film); it's an intriguing film and at times a powerful one, but it could have been so much more.3/4"
3,Interesting Movie,"I watched this movie the other night, and must say that I enjoyed it. It was kind of weird and the whole premise was wayyyyy out there, but the aliens were kind of cute."
5,Delivery was WAAAAY faster than anticipated!,"Delivery was supposed to take 2 weeks, I got the product in 4 days! It was well packaged and I would buy from them again."
5,An Odd little Movie,"It's a lot like seeing a wreck on the freeway, its horrific, but you can't seem to fight the impulse to do a little rubber-necking. A little offbeat would be an understatement, but a solid sci-fi movie. There is an underlying tone throughout that is quite frankly a little disturbing. Maybe we are just not used to pushing the envelope this far when viewing the dark side of an alien invasion."
5,What a grate movie....,This movie is wicked. I love it because it is major wicked and not dumb. LOL. This movie is daaaa bomb.
4,District 9,"great movie, i've watched it several times and can't wait till district 10 comes out. Amazon had a great price for it I will buy more products soon."
1,Junk,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen, somehow it ended up in my recomendations, but I thought it was one of worst movies ever, the action parts were alright, but the story was horrible and dragged on, and the ending was horrible."
1,WALKED OUT,"I am not a professional theater critic but I know what I like and this aint it! If I could rate it no stars I would. This was the first time EVER that I walked out of a theater and went to another movie to ""wash the images out of my mind""! The documentary form was lousy to say the least. It had good potential in the story line, but turned it to a total waste of time! I am not proud to say that I stayed 3/4 of the way thru to give it a chance, but I couldnt stand it anylonger and left!"
1,Disapointment,"The aliens looked totally fake & a lot of the time that should have been used explaining why the human race appeared not to care that aliens were on the planet Earth was wasted with what appeared to be live camera footage in the main actor's face. It was a terrible movie & not worth seeing. It's not original, in the sense that bad movies have been made before."
1,the most Horrible Moive ever,i dont see how anyone can like this.15 min of this and i turned it off.and when i say its bad its bad.its not easy to get just 1 star from me. O.oif you dont trust me rent it first please!
1,Horrible Moive,"This movie should be at least in the top 5 worst movies of all time if not the worst. Awful, horrendous, boring, stupid or ridiculous could all be used to describe this movie. The point where you think, it has to get better, trust me it never does. I didn't know garbage gets rated 5 stars and I didnt want to give this 1 star. It was a painful struggle to finish this movie, 0 enjoyment. I will NEVER watch this pathetic movie again. The people that rated this movie 5 stars must have seen a different movie. As bad of a movie as Torque or Alone in the Dark were, they are drastically ahead of this one."
5,Engrossed,"You can't turn away. From the first moment, the film's style won't turn you loose. At its core, this seems like a re-make of some other movie, but the setting (South Africa), the accents, the actors, the special effects, combined with the pacing and inability to guess the outcome, make the film a unique experience. I recommend it for family viewing, if your kids can handle the gore."
5,will appeal to certain types of people,i think this is a very thought provoking movie how ever the blood and gore will not appeal to every one. i think however that the director does an excellent job with the story and is somthing unique yet it has a realistic feel to it. definately worth having in your collection
3,"Well, interesting . . . .","I saw this film in the theater along with my son and my brother. I expected more and overall I liked it, except for two things. First, the ending as mentioned by others, was so unlike the rest of the film it was jarring. Suddeny there's this Robocop-like suit and . . . . well, I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Secondly, not all sci-fi/action film lovers appreciate over-the-top use of profanity. I started counting the number of times the ""F-word"" was used because it started to get so rediculous! It was like one writer said, ""Wait! I can't think what they would say here!"" and another writer replied, ""Oh, just have them say the F-word."" I'd say rent, not buy."
4,A prawn cracker!,"Blomkamp's darkly comic, intelligent satire is also hugely entertaining and contains a tour-de-force performance from the unknown lead Sharlto Copley. Although the allegory is thinly veiled, and the logic somewhat flawed, it still packs a significant punch. The movie deals with themes we're all familiar with but adds a freshness to the mix by placing a stranded alien race at the heart of the matter. There's lots of gore, lots of profanity, lots of energy, and lots of humour. And the message is thoughtfully constructed: the lead character's dramatic and poignant epiphany is all the more believable because of his conflicted viewpoint. It's also worth mentioning the effects, which are impressive given the apparently modest budget. Excellent and worthy of 4.5/5."
5,Great movie,this was a great movie in the theaters and it is even better on my couch with a great surround system. Love it!
5,Great Movie,"I'm a big sci-fi fan, and after watching this movie on TV in the past I decided to finally order it, and the two-disc edition was worth getting because of all the features, but mine actually came with a third disc (bonus disc) which shown some footage at comic con. This movie has one of the stories that leaves you wondering what will happen to the main character. It's really good to look into. Check this movie out as a rental from a store, or buy it from amazon, because the price is worth it and the movie is very intresting."
1,Not Even Worth Renting,I only spent a couple bucks renting this flick...that was a couple too many. Absolutely not something I would have expected to see from the LOTR/King Kong super team behind Peter Jackson. I strongly believe that was 112 minutes better spent elsewhere.
1,Disappointing and not so great as advertised,"I was so excited to get this DVD and watch it but it disappointed me. The first 30-40 minutes of the movie is just confusing and does not make sense much. The rest of the movie is violent, inhumane and full of gory scenes. It did not have an iota of message about humanity or did I miss something? Any how, I did not get the story line and do not recommend this movie. It's overrated."
1,What???,From the first scene I was waiting for the documentary format to change to the real story. It never happened. The movie is not a good movie. Don't waste your time.
1,Waste of time,"A complete waste of actors talents, complete waste of my time, waste of material it took to make the dvd.Not worth what you spend on it."
1,One of the Worst Movies Ever,"My wife and I both see a lot of movies and we often disagree- but we both agreed that this is one of the worst movies we've ever seen. We fell for the hype that surrounded this dog and paid full price to see this movie instead of waiting till it reached Redbox and boy was that a mistake. Maybe the movie is designed for fourteen year old boys or something- I'm not sure, but it was absolutely horrible."
2,No Dolby Digital,"The big problem I have with this disk is that it does not have an unfettered Dolby Digital track (it does have a ""descriptive"" track which means in addition to the surround your have to listen to a narrator describe each scene). I do not have a DTS receiver so my only choice is PCM with only gives me stereo, not surround, which significantly diminishes the movie."
2,Very big let down,I have not been so let down by a movie since There Will Be Blood. I just didn't see the great movie that everybody was raving about. Aliens and special effects were pretty good and the ending was a good surprise. But the movie dragged and dragged. Cannot recommend this movie unless you have nothing else to watch.
2,"Not that good at all, rent first!","Careful with what people say here. Anyone who says ""This is the best film of the year"" or ""The best film ever"" cast a skeptic eye on those comments. No way this is better than ""Star Trek"", ""Public Enemies"" or ""Avatar"" This is clearly a grade 'B' sci fi along the lines of ""Cloverfiled"" To save money on production costs, you are not even shown a clear, hi-def image of the space ship until near the end. Not the best screenwiting either in my opinion. You are mostly jostled around as a third party video cam reporter. This does not lend to very much replay value since you never really feel engaged. Save a few dollars on a potential dog in your collection by renting this first like I did and see if you like it enough to buy it."
4,"Interesting premise, great production, muddled story","I just watched ""District 9"" on DVD, and now kind of wish I'd seen it on the big screen. The production values are impressive and the lead actor (Copley) deserves to be nominated for a ""best performance"" award. But while the movie's premise - aliens stranded on Earth, herded into a grubby shantytown - offers grist for social commentary, the pacing is slow at the start and the story deteriorates into ""Transformers"" style blow-em-up action near the end. Definitely a cut or two above average, but its flaws keep it from earning five stars."
4,A very good movie that could have been even better...,"...had it not been for the dozens upon dozens of f-bombs. ""It's just being realistic"" you say? Perhaps, but I have trouble believing the mild mannered bureaucrat at the beginning of the film would end up having trouble saying a sentence without one or more f-bombs, even with all he went through. One here or there I can accept as realistic, but not *that* many.As for the violence, it's not the level of violence --- which I can see as ""realistic"" --- but rather it being so graphical. Was it really necessary to show every single death as it happened?That said, the film is very, very good. I especially liked how the friendship developed between Wikus and Christopher the alien and the alien's son.If you can stomach the language and the violence, ""District 9"" is definitely worth watching. Just take a shower afterward."
2,so-so,"This wasn't the worst SciFi flick I've seen, but it was over-hyped and just so-so. And the twist ending (as such), could be seen coming a mile away."
3,Walk a Mile,"District 9 was filmed using a handheld camera for the documentary part of the movie, which works, giving an authentic feel to the interview sequences. Then it switches to traditional filming. Pay close attention to the documentary section; otherwise, questions such as ""why didn't the aliens...?"" will distract from enjoying the movie. Also, keep in mind, that this movie was made on a low budget.PLOT - MAY BE CONSIDERED SPOILERS:The aliens of a stranded spaceship struggle to live among humans as they search for a way to go home. Native Earthlings, realizing the aliens have nowhere else to go, place them on a reservation called District 9. The Earthlings then repeat history by making irrational assumptions to uphold racist beliefs and justify their poor treatment of the newcomers.The film stops just short of making a grand political statement and allows some humor to offset the tone just enough to keep it entertaining. It also contains squeamish and violent bloody scenes."
3,"GREAT PREMISE, BUT TOO LONG AND INCONSISTENT! 3 1/2 STARS!","This is a tough film to review because I'm sure a lot of people loved it and a lot of people hated it. I liked the film because it is undeniably original and has a haunting quality with excellent FX. Unfortunately what I didn't like about it is that the film seems very choppy and loud, which distracts from the interesting story. I know this was intentional, but I'm not sure it was that way to go. I think the premise could stand alone without all of the bouncing around and explosions.No one seems to have touched on the fact that this film is a satire about illegal immigrants, I know the setting mirrors the apartheid, but it's really more global in its conception. It's a very cool film, but I was bored at times, which is hard to believe because the film is stunning to look at.I wish that you could change your star ratings on reviews as I'm sure this film will grow on me over time and I might have bumped this one up another star."
4,Great Movie,"Great movie, great shipping. Got to see Battle: LA for free by buying this. Saw District 9 when it came out. A lot of parallels between the two movies (although District 9 is far and beyond a better movie.)"
5,Fantastic,"This movie is superb. The first time I saw it I loved it. The second time it was even better. It does a great job of making the viewer say, ""Could this really happen? What would I do in this situation?"" Great film!"
3,"good movie, much shortened BD","I went to the movie and liked it very much. It was the best SciFi of the year, superior to Startrek or Terminator. To my astonishment a lot of scenes were cut out in the BD version. The small child alien actually directs the war robot, but this scene is cut out. This really makes the movie not as good as the theatrical version, a bad commercial descision. I would recommend don't buy and wait for the extended version..."
2,Horribly mediocre...,I love sci-fi but I recommend that you Netflix this if one if you want to see it. The movie lacks momentum and it is true challenge to like or even relate to the protagonist. The whole movie seems to be the background or setup for another movie. The solid special effects and cinematography does not make up for the lack of interest I felt. I am glad I did watch it on blu-ray because I could at least fast-forward through parts of it.
2,The trailers were the best parts of the movie,"I had not seen the movie but thought it would be a good sci-fi flick for me. Well should have rented it first. Most of the movie was in the format of a documentary. Similar to the opening sequence for the old TV show ""Alien Nation"". I am not a fan of that perspective in a movie. Special effects/CGI were pretty good but that was about it. The movie did leave itself open for a sequel which I would not see unless it was produced as a normal movie."
4,"If you didnt like this movie, it only means that you're closed minded and boring","District 9 is what you get when you mix the following films:TerminatorIndependence DayAliensTransformersAnd the XBOX hit ""HALO""there are also a few others that I cannot think of at the moment.Awesome movie, its a bi polar mix of social commentary, action, drama, adventure, science fiction, etc. Its a complete genre blender.This is also one movie, where in my opinion, the special effects are directly on point.I find that a lot of action movies today with huge SFX, such as Transformers, hsve action scenes that move way too fast to keep sight on, and they kind of become just a big blur of noise and colors. But maybe thats just me.I cant wait for ""District 10"" to come out.Best alien costumes/figures since ""Aliens"""
5,"Best movie of 2009, hands down.","OK.. i feel im a pretty decent movie buff.this movie was up with one of the best, if not the best, of 2009.Graphics: top notch.Story: incredibly ingulfing. i mean at first i was thinking ""wow, is this gonna pick up"".. than after 8 minutes ""ok.. i like the way peter jackson is doing this.. but how will the story progress"" and than just outta no where BAM it takes off.Acting: Actors are unknowns but WOW do they do a great job.. and i mean great job.PETER JACKSON IS A GOD. end of storyi feel there will be a sequel for sure."
3,Subtitles,"When I saw this in the theatre, the aliens had subtitles, on the dvd, they dont unless you add subtitles throughout the entire movie. Whats up with that? Please explin"
1,"If you loved ""Aliens in the Attic"" but wanted more blood....","Wow! I rented this movie at the Red Box for a $1 and I still feel ripped off! If this is as one reviewer says ""A new direction for SciFi"" I hope they make a U turn quick! I'd give my 4 stars to Star Trek ANYDAY. I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this space fluff :( I think its just a lot of Peter Jackson worshippers out there trying to pump this film up. No Thanks guys.It was just so campy and ridiculous. I could also compare it to Evil Dead, which I could never completely sit through.I think a lot of people are going to be scratching their heads about this getting so many good reviews....Next!I'll be watching the $5 bluray rental of wolverine tonight, I hope it will not be as disappointing."
1,PS3 owners beware!,"Even though you can go through multiple setting changes to try, this blue ray does not work on play station 3.It simply doesn't work. I've gone through exchanges and talked to others online.... it's a known problem.It's a great movie.... just buy the DVD."
1,District minus 4,"I rented this movie because I'm a big sci-fi fan. The special effects are okay, but in no way carry this movie.The main character is almost Monty Phythonish and the whole ""documentary style"" is unbelievable to the point of being laughable at times.What's worse is that the whole premise of the movie is ridiculos and it never explains anything about why the aliens came or arrived here, or anything else about them even though they apparently understand English better than the employees at your local McDonalds and we understand them perfectly. I guess Dan Rather wasn't avaiable to do a sit down interview with them.This movie had as much forethought about plot development as a Don Knotts movie.My advice; rent or buy something else; this is 112 minutes of my life I'll never get back!"
1,"Good plot, no resolution","Even the most basic student of storytelling (in whatever format) knows that a great story must have an introduction, a conflict, and ultimately a climax and a resolution. This movie is strong on intro and plot, but weak on climax and a failure on resolution. What is the ultimate outcome???? The movie criticizes apartheid (Congratulations, I think everyone in the modern world agrees apartheid was evil), but what is the end of the story???? I wasted nearly 2 hours developing sympathy for the oppressed alien prawns and I still don't know is their ultimate future???? Nice political points, but pathetic storytelling!!!"
1,Painful,"Profoundly boring. The trailers showed the only action in the movie, and even that was unremarkable. I don't even recommend renting it. Alien Nation was infinitely better as a comparison."
1,What a piece of garbage,Is it just me ... I don't know - I don't care. I hated this movie. I don't like movies that do newsreels and reality TV show type. I am throwing it out - I watched 45 minutes of it and that was enough. Had I been in the theater I would have walked out.
1,poor,"i""ve seen worse but not much worse. i hate how the camera guy jerks the camera around. it was hard to follow. i would compare it to cloverfield. which was totally worthless."
5,Great Sci Fi movie,"I went to see Transformers 2 knowing pretty much what to expect, and ended up being let down.I went to see this movie in theaters shortly after, not knowing what to expect at all, and i was blown away. One of the best Sci fi movies i've seen in along time, very original.I also couldn't believe it was made on such a small budget."
4,Violent but very moving,"We noticed that our cable TV's ratiing system gave this movie fourstars, which is pretty unusual, so we watched it. Not sure we've everwatched a South African movie before. It was nominated for fourOscars. It's extremely violent -- anybody who has problems withrepeated and gory violence shouldn't attempt this. It's well-actedwith moderately good production values for this kind of aliens movie-- definitely not Spielberg, but not Dr Who, either. It uses the wayhumans treat a group of stranded aliens as a metaphor for racism andbigotry among humanity, and shows one man, who has been sent in toprepare the aliens to be moved to an even more basic camp than theircurrent slum, coming to see them as fellow beings as he suffersthrough horrible 'adventures'. I loved the gripping documentary style. We couldn't stop watching despite the horrific violence."
2,Will make you motion sick!,"I was really starting to get into this movie (I LOVE sci-fi!) but unfortunately it was shot using the ""hand-held camera"" perspective, which means that the camera bounces around like in a home movie.This make people who are prone to motion sickness very nauseous during the movie. I was only able to watch the first 30 minutes before I was overcome by motion sickness.I've googled around, and this is a pretty common complaint of this movie. Too bad!"
2,A teenage boy's wet-dream..,"Great if you like big handheld weapons and people spectacularly being blown up by them, special effects were good. Basically its a buddy movie, the ""bromance"" is between an alien and a human scientist filmed like a documentary. Plenty of gore, violence and cussing...one for the kids!"
3,Boring for the most part and not really Sci-Fi,"District 9 is not a SciFi movie, its a social commentary on the human condition in Africa. The movie is about the millions of displaced refugees all over the region, living in poverty and squaller, with no home to return to and no government or people who wants them. Its about the state of affairs in the camps and the abuse of the refugees by their so called benefactors. The Prawns, shrimp like alien creatures are a symbol for the way that these refugees are treated and looked at as subhuman... SciFi fans will be dissappointed!District 9 [Blu-ray]District 9 (Two-Disc Edition)District 9 (Single-Disc Edition)"
2,Think of 'The Fly' but without being on steriods,"I just about ejected this thing 3/4's of the way through, but the best part is at the end of the movie, so I hung on to finish it. This was basically a bunch of dribble built around some good CGI aliens that were caught on earth because they lost a piece of their spaceship that was (for some unknown reason) parked over the slums of Johannesburg. They actually showed the piece coming off the ship but could not find it???????????? and were magically stuck on earth for the next 20 years; give me a break!!! The fooooking actors were bad, bad, bad in there Africani style, and in a lot of scenes, hard to understand (Duhhh). I had the distinction of watching this right after Inglourious basterds; Oh my God, my brain is full of dribble and I need to flush it out with a good movie. GOOD LUCK"
3,Awefully Stupid,"This was a movie with very good, and believable, special effects. However, the plot was horrible. Why didn't these Aliens just restart the Space ship over the city when they were up there? Why did it take the Alien father and his son 20 years to build a ship on the ground to fly up to the large ship over the city? Afterall, it was their technology to begin with. The Aliens looked like Insects. All of this short comings are forgivable. I think the producers had a good morale-line of the story, I think they tried to tell us about the ""what does it feel like to in the other shoe"" story. I gave it 3 stars because the Aliens looked like the FLY from the movie, THE FLY, etc. I brought this movie from Amazon's pay to watch. I have to admit the internet has changed since 1995. There was no lag in the movie, and on my 1080p Monitor, it was very sharp and crisp and clear."
1,Boring and senseless,"This movie was boring , confusing and senseless, all the charaters were unlikable, I truly do not understand all the praise this move got from critics.It was to be a parody of racism, but they did a much better job with ""alien nation"" years before."
1,wanted to like it.. but cant,"this movie is a waist of time.. i think they put Peter Jacksons name on it so they could sell it..the first half is like a documentary with horrid low budget actors.. the aliens who live in the ""shanty"" town are silly... they have elements of ghetto thugs but trying to be cute about it.. then the main character who completely unbelievable becomes half alien and fight the humans.. who are imprisoning the aliens for 2 decades blah blah.. its a steaming pile of crap... save your money and rent it at a red box thing for a dollar.. the only thing good was the last 15 minutes or so.. the action/killing scenes are kinda cool.. just not worth buying to own.. trust me im sorry i did"
3,Wrong DVD details,"I can't rate the movie, why? simply because I didn't watch it, is quite simple, in the details section it announces:Language: English.Subtitles: Cantonese, English, French, Korean, Spanish.Well at least the DVD Amazon sent to me in the end of 2009, it has only English and French Language tracks and subtitles, moreover, the DVD box post it very clear:Language: English, French5.1 (Dolby Digital), English Audio Description TrackSubtitles: English, French.This very stupid because the data is completely incorrect, I prefer when they only place ""English"" with no further details.Finally I just drop it to the garbage because return an item is impossible from where I live (Spain) because the cheaper standard mail (with tracking package) charge me close to $10.00 (6.90 ) for a DVD case."
5,Human Greed at its' Typical Level,"I won't say anything new here, but make sure you do read the previous reviews by Leif Sheppard and N.Durham. Don't pixel peep at the movie color quality like some reviewers do, but look at the story being told.""District 9"" depicts human greed and selfishness at its worst, and what better individuals to show it than white south africans and those twisty nigerians. The MNU seems to be the equivalent of current UN organisation that we have.The very same thing is happening to our wildlife and forests, the parallels are there. Don't miss this movie, it's a keeper."
3,Potentially Great,"I had high hopes for this film. The combination of political intrigue, poignant views on racism, questions of ""un""-human rights, the science fiction genre (specifically about aliens), and spot on specially effects, should have made this a 5 star reveiw. The fact is, it just missed on all of these points. The set up is great, but the plot is lacking. The acting was also sub-par, save for Sharlto Copley, who I thought did a decent job.I liked the mocumentary style, and I really liked the cable feeds in the beginning.This may have been a 4 star review if I did't have such high expectaions going into the film."
1,Flat out awful!,Man I have seen some bad movies but this one is really terrible. I watched the whole thing and I can't believe people are giving this 4 and 5 stars. I'd give it a negative if that were possible. Even Plan 9 From Outerspace was better than this.
1,Worst movie ever made,"This is a horrible, disgusting, disgrace of a movie. Made of pointless death, torture, and merits no information of value and isn't even close to being entertaining. Mixed in with two hours of mindless killing, it insults the audience with a non plausible joke of compassion between whoever, without any believable reasoning."
1,What's the point?,"I have read numerous reviews which in part dictates my choice of movies. I have never had the time to write my own review, but since I am writing this one, tells you how disappointed I was when I watched District 9.To be honest, I never got through the whole movie. To me, what's the point? I read other reviews and waited for this to come out on DVD, and then got the movie for Christmas. I was in high anticipation for this, but extremely let down.I absolutely hated the biography, interview type format. In simple words, it is just a stupid movie. Special effects were okay, but this movie was slow moving, dragged on and on, and just plain didn't make sense. I have no idea how others can rate this film on pure entertainment."
1,What a disappoinment,"This movie gets worse the closer to the end it gets. If you hated Transformers, you'll hate this movie as well. There are brilliant sci-fi movies like Contact and 2001: A Space Odyssey, but District 9 represents the other end of the spectrum."
1,Almost unwatchable . . . even as a rental,"I have read/watched fantasy/SF for more than 30 years. The story line was absurd. The format (pseudo-docu) was off-putting. The prawns are revolting to look at and not worth taking the time to understand, and the humans are one-dimensional cardboard. After an hour I had no sympathy or interest in any of the characters or what passed for a plot.Save your money and use it to take someone you love to see Avatar instead."
1,Not good enough to be bad sci-fi,"I love sci-fi, I love bad sci-fi...D9 isn't good enough to be bad sci-fi. My 7 yr old could have made this movie. The documentary style was interesting at first but soon became annoying. The acting was horrible. The characters had no depth, they were sterile and fake. The Wikus character's ""happy"" disposition didn't fit in with the story line. D9 is like taking a bad idea for a movie, and using it to make a bad movie. If you think smashing your hand with a hammer would be fun then you are going to love this movie."
1,Aweful sciencefiction movie,"I am a huge fan of science fiction movies. And honestly, I enjoy 85% of the ones I watch, but this one was just aweful.Special effects were great, acting was ok, but the story was bad in my opinion."
1,No even one-star,On the movie: Please rent this blu-ray movie before you made your purchase. I am a die hard Sci Fic fan since don't know when. This movie for me is unbearable. I forced myself to finish this movie simply because I purchased it with my hard earn money.
1,Stupid and Cheesy,"Sci-fi movies like Alien, Predator,& Signs, were great movies. The t.v. mini series ""V"" did it so much better and much more believable than this hunk of junk. This movie suffered in more ways than one. The plot had some promise, however the acting was a joke, none of the HUMAN characters had any real depth so the acting fell flat just going through the motions of reading the script the same as you would a newspaper. Making the Aliens look like giant shrimp wearing body armour whos idea was that???? Giving it the documentary feel only helped contribute to the cheapola B movie factor. I am in total disbelief that so many viewers liked this movie giving it 5 stars..! To me it looked cheesy and just plain stupid."
1,Defaulty,Twice I had ordered the blue ray District 9 from Amazon and both times the video did not open to play. What is the reasoning?My expectations were not met and delivery of a product that I had intended to receive and keep were not met on both occasions.Otherwise I have been completely satisfied with previous orders. I can only guess that there was a problem in reproduction.
2,I Really wanted to Love this movie but...,"This movie was supposed to be a great movie and so I decided to purchase it. After watching it, I was extremely disappointed. I knew this movie was made cheaply and was suppose to be great, and so I wanted it to be great, I really did. However, I never really got into the movie and thought it was a waste of a couple hours. The effects are great and everything, I just never truly got into the story. Maybe two stars is a little harsh, but it is not worth buying, maybe worth a one night rental."
2,Worst SciFi movie I've seen in a while,"I was really looking forward to this movie because of the very interesting premise, but I was sorely disappointed. The special effects and acting were good but in the end it was just a waste of time. This movie was visually unappealing (just gross) and at the end there was no reason for watching (no redeeming quality). At the end of the movie, I just felt ""EWWWW""."
3,STRAIGHT OUT OF JO-BURG,"This movie came with a great deal of hype and frankly it just doesnt live up to it. The docu. feel of the movie is a nice touch, but really I never cared much about the protagonist, he just seemed like such a yutz, and this story has been done to death. Yeah, yeah, I get the story is a metaphor for Aparteid, set above Johannesburg etc..but it just really didnt resonate with me. The special effects are a low budget, but really not bad, but the creatures are horrible, I mean what in the hell are they suppose to be?..couldnt they have come up with cooler looking aliens?!!..have they not seen, uh Aliens?!!..this movie is similar to Alien Nation, but really not as interesting and they ending is sort of..uh O.K.?..Maybe had the acting been better, and the story not so rote, I may have been able to get into this film, but frankly im clueless at to why it got so much hype."
2,Targeted at a very select audience...,"I've read a number of glowing reviews on this movie, and have to wonder where the scifi genre is headed. It appears to me the movie was created and presented solely as a shock movie, rather than the more conventional ""story based"" movie. It is evident from the very beginning you are in South Africa, and are destined to stay there. The ""news commentary format"" left this viewer cold, and the Apartheid innuendo throughout felt forced. Perhaps I, as the viewer, just doesn't want to be reminded of(make that force fed) an infamous part of history yet again! Yes, this movie seems targeted towards a narrowly defined type of viewer...I just don't happen to fit into that category.To be fair, there were a number of scenes near the end where you could genuinely feel sympathy for the two principal characters and had a feeling of a story emerging, but it came a bit too late for overall effective story telling..."
3,South Africa and Aliens,Interesting concept for a movie. South Africa certainly has recent history of treating beings who don't look similar as second class citizens. Great set up for a sequel!
4,"As they say on Robot Chicken ""What a Tweest ! ""","We rented this film. We love scifi and thought this was a great movie. It has an unusual twist to it and if you can sit back, relax and not analyze it too much you will enjoy it. It's a little slow in the beginning and the main character is a bit annoying but, it was still a good movie.The special effects were pretty good - 4 out of 5The plot was great - 4 out of 5The Ending was great - 4 out of 5The Acting/Cast was good - 3 out of 5Worth the rental."
5,Great Little Movie,"Not what I expected... it was much better. I gave it 5 stars because I have never seen anything quite like it and I thought it was incredibly well done. Original, imaginative, gripping, not to mention bizarre. Just when you think it's all been done before, a movie like this comes along. Like ""Pi"" I'll probably never watch it again... once was enough... but I'm really glad I saw it and it will stick in my memory for a long time."
3,Rent before you buy,"Before buying this movie, I recommend you rent it. SCI-FI fans may enjoy many parts as I did, but not worth purchasing. An intriguing story, but seems like it was thrown together to finish by a deadline."
3,A little Hoakey,"The acting was amateur and the attempt to look like a documentary was distracting. There were a few good moments. The aliens themselves looking like a comic book fan designed them on a limited budget. Not very believable.All in all, it was entertaining albeit for a 12 year old."
3,"Good extras, good movie, need subtitles in spanish","The 2 disc edition this great movie deserves. The only problem is that it lacks of spanish subtitles. For me is not a problem, but it is for my girlfriends and some of my friends."
4,Im not 100% sold on the acting...,"You would think someone in help wouldn't be so mean of a person. Someone in such of help as the guy in this movie you would expect to be trying to make friends not enemies. This is a good movie to rent, but don't waste your money buying it. Spend it on something a little more well written."
3,Could have been great?,"This film had a great deal of potential and in many respects was quite good. Loved the premise and setting, hated the style and nonsensical elements. I thought the main character was handled poorly in fact most of the human elements were poorly done. The aliens were well done as well as the CG. A better and more engaging cast/characters would have made this film a must see. I found nothing engaging about this film other than one alien and his child (6 min. total) My grandpa should get in the movie business, theres a man that knows how to tell a story to all demographics."
3,WEARD MOVIE,A Friend told me to get this movie and I did kinda weard but showes what can happend with a imagation
1,Almost Threw Out Disk,"This is one of the worst films ever made. I wouldn't even consider it a B horror flick. I don't know what the the author is trying to convey other than refugee camps are bad and if we do it to aliens that can eat us, we are really bad. Another movie denegrating the human race and developed countries as power hungry, war mongering, and arrogant. If you are an Obama fan, you will love this movie. It is so bad, that my disk had drop outs and I was going to just throw it out, take the $19 dollar loss, and not waste time going for a replacement. Eventually, I did pickup a replacement, but I am still wondering why."
2,I give a two for subject but grab a bottle of motion sickness pills.,"I think that this movie deals with some serious subject matter, but it never really culminated into anything tangible. A lot of fast camera shots and decent special effects. I still found myself wishing I was somewhere else, doing something else. 2 out of 5 stars from me."
2,Why do people like this?,I don't understand why this has so many positive reviews. This movie is so bad i could not finish it. Thats saying alot because i sat all the way threw Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. There are no big name actors in this movie. I'm not saying you need a Will Smith or Tom Cruise but maybe it would have helped. These actors seem like complete amateurs. The main character is this realy boring little man. I read a 5 star review that admitted that the main character was very hard to like. If you believe that then why would you give it 5 stars? Even the aliens don't seem very intriguing. I gave it 2 stars because it does try to tell a decent story. It just fails everytime that it tries. Watch this at the risk of being bored out of your mind!
1,"Watch out... not a 10"" blade.","I suppose I should have noticed that a 10 inch blade in a 22 inch package was a bit fishy. I didn't though, and I now have a useless (to me) 20 inch blade due to Amazon's mis-titled listing."
5,med alice pack,the pack that I recived was in really good shape the only problem with my order was that I ordered a med pack but to my surprise I recived a large pack
4,Nice little reference title,"Few organisations can have had such a convoluted history as American Railroads. You could get a serious headache just trying to work out what ran where and when, and what belonged to who. As the book outlines the closures and amalgamations were also complex and far from simple. It has potted histories of most of the major players and some fascinating maps of the growth and contraction of US track age.This is a vast subject and this is really only a pocket book but given that it's a useful little reference book that any rail fan will find useful"
1,A Poor Effort,"Not well done. Poor quality video, even considering it's been 30+ years. Terrible edigint and worst of wall was the very poor narrating. To add insult is the exhorbitant price."
4,Very impressive but not as good as Mush or the split album,"After 1 1/2 listens to ""dog disco"" by Leatherface I must say it is pretty damn good. More of the same in a sense. But it's even harder to hear/understand the singer (Stubbs) than before (my only real criticism). He sounds like a growling dog recorded kind of low, which is part of its charm but can also be frustrating. The musicianship is even more advanced though with the two guitars doing some wild stuff. It's not as immediately catchy as Mush or Horsebox. Still it is a rough sound that does not make for 'easy listening' and is in no way an attempt to find a broader audience. Just the band, and one of punk's very best, doing its own thing."
2,Garlic lovers' delight! No vampires here!,"Good golly, Miss Molly, does this woman love garlic! She even puts a quarter of a cup of garlic (admittedly for 8 servings), eggplant and a jalapeno pepper (!) in her ""classic"" Bolognese sauce - which, in the traditional recipe, has no garlic, let alone no eggplant, and we're not even going to address the jalapeno, but does have a carrot and celery. Carrot and celery seem adequately healthy to warrant their inclusion in Bolognese sauce - perhaps Ms. Rosso might have called her sauce something other than Bolognese, since it is so far from the real recipe and miles away from ""classic."" Yes, okay, you can adjust the recipes to suit your taste. I just find so few recipes here that I feel like tackling - something about the recipes - perhaps it's the long ingredients lists - just makes them feel so complicated I can't imagine actually working your way through the book as a meal plan for a month."
1,Disappointment,"The Silver Palate Cookbook is a favorite in my house, but Fresh Start has sat in my bookshelf for a year basically unused. Why? I cannot stand the way the book is organized (according to menu plans) and the index section does not compensate. This was a disappointment."
4,Not really what I was expecting,"I was expecting a bit more on the science of the process and not so much the logistics of the processes. This seems like a handy guide for a technical school class or shop class. If I ever get my hands on a welder at home, this will prove to be a great guide. For the processes used in today's industries, it is a bit out of date."
4,excellent celtic folk-rock,"I heard these guys at Seattle's Folklife festival several years ago. They're from British Columbia, I believe. Anyway, what you have here is some very good Celtic folk-rock. In particular I like Dirt & Stone, which sounds like an original tune but it is very engaging, and The Dewey Dells of Yarrow, which is a lovely cover of an old folk song with beautiful vocals and is the equal of anything from my favorite folk-rock groups -- Steeleye Span, Figgy Duff, etc."
2,pages scanned poorly,"around word 93, the person that was scanning this book page by page got tired and got some pages out of order, this book was not put together very well, and is worth about 1 dollar."
2,Words Some People Confuse,Not for advanced readers. This is pretty rudimentary stuff and is really for someone who doesn't read or write much. Price and format are both good. Might be a good gift for a high school student who is daunted by English courses.
1,DOA and no customer service,"The first day I received this item I tried to turn it on, and it didn't. It wouldn't work with batteries, nor with the cable. I called customer service and left a message. And waited.They never got back to me. To add insult to injury, I couldn't even follow up with them, since the automated message warned that leaving extra messages would only delay a response.EDIT: They eventually got back to me, and accepted a return for a refund."
1,disappointed,"Germ Guardian LW18 UV-C Light WandThe package the wand was received in did not have a return address on it and the wand package had been opened and did not contain any instruction for use. Now the wand is beeping and I've not idea why. Also it looked used and I thought I""d ordered a new product."
2,Recommendations do not.Bad shapeWell no charge.The fire comes in..I draw the wrong I do not know what ...,Recommendations do not.Bad shapeWell no charge.The fire comes in..I draw the wrong I do not know what ...
4,"Two perfect, one is secondhand??","I bought 3 books, the first two were perfect, however the last one was damaged and the back cover was was dirty and was marked with a pen. I think, it was used by someone, perhaps second hand."
3,Advanced concepts,"This book is quite difficult to understand and the concepts contained in it are quite complicated. With that in mind, and the fact that I did not understand most of it, I can't fairly rate it. I will however warn any potential buyer that a thorough knowledge of Calculus and Matrix Algebra is required to fully understand the text."
3,good book for really learning,i need the questions at the end of each chapter for better understanding of it. the book is for science grasuates
2,Helicopter Theory,"OK for a reference book, but much too bulky for any classroom. Mr. Johnson would do well to write an abridged addition. There does not appear to be any attempt to start with basic concepts and proceed to more difficult ones. Try to get a copy to review before buying it."
5,Excellent songs by the wonderful Charley Pride,"These songs are pure Charley. If you like his older songs, you will like these also. His voice is still excellent, and the songs are beautiful."
2,This brand/company does not offer FREE recycling,"I've bought APC replacement batteries in the past. They have all come with a FREE shipping label to recycle the old battery. This battery came with a list of recycling centers and told me I was responsible for getting the old battery to one of them. Considering this will likely cost me $10+ in shipping, it almost negates the money I saved by not buying APC. Go with the APC unless you are prepared to recycle the old battery on your own."
5,Great for traveling with my laptop.,"Some hotels still offer only wired Internet in their rooms. This requires I continue to carry an ethernet cable. When extended, it is almost six feet, yet so compact when retracted. Made of good quality materials. The included optional cross-over adapter is great for connecting two computers together for high speed data transfers. I've done this rather than look around the house for an external USB storage device; which often times is not available because they already are storing other data I don't want to delete. In today's wireless world, there is a tendency to think of wired networking as passé but for large transfers and when most computers today have gigabit data ports, this Cat6 cable can't be beat."
4,Great Read with Historical Errors,"If romantic historical fiction is your thing, this book is for you. Ms. Seton is incapable of boring anyone. There's a lot of history here but it's important to know that there were two errors discovered. The author states that Dr. John Radcliffe attempted to help Charles Radclyffe who had been condemned to death. Dr. Radcliffe died one year before the arrest of Charles. She also states that Jenny, illegitimate daughter of Charles emigrated to Virginia to be with Rob Wilson and they had a plantation named Snowden/Snowdon. The property referred to was purchased from the Indians by Thomas Jefferson's father. No white person had ever lived there or owned it. So it must be assumed that both Jenny and Rob were ""made-up"" characters to assist the writer in making the book more exciting. A great deal of research went into discovering these errors but I am not disappointed. It's still a fine book and as I recall was on the best seller lists, justifiably."
3,So-so,"I really wanted to like this book more than I did. I have to say, I totally agree with the reviewer who couldn't bear to read another ""hinnie"". The Scottish words felt forced to me, and where I wanted a story on Charles's life and deeds, it was more like disjointed flashbacks to me. Disappointing, but not terrible."
1,Don't bother,"For all the rave reviews, I expected so much more. This book seemed to drone on and on. I frankly quit reading about one-third of the way through. I just couldn't get into the story. The characters were one dimensional and the plot was predictable. Don't waste your time reading the 500+ pages with extremely small print."
2,Taste terrible.,A great example of what not to freeze dry. This barely edible product can still be used to demonstrate how hard it is to design good Astronaut food.
2,This sun does not rise,"David Ignatius is advertised as "" an acclaimed novelist with a keen eye for the subleties of power and politics ."" Maybe. But he does not show off any of these bloodlines in this flat-as-a-pancake novel. So dumbed down that it seems like farce to those who really know Washington politics and power ,""Sun King"" peopels another conman on the stage, another media star woman who wants to boff her way to the middle,and another limp plot without surprises . In the real world the mystery of the Washington newspaper"" owned "" by a Korean clown remains unsolved .Maybe Ignatius should forget rerwriting Fitzgerald novels and devote his smarts to cracking the odd case of the Washington Times ."
3,NOT EVERYBODY CAN LIVE ON GOLDEN STREET!,"First off, unlike the above editorial review, I can't call this a full-length disc...I think it's an EP, and the price point bears that fact out. And you can tell by my review title that I don't think it's as good as the stunning ""Golden Street."" Having said that, there are some things to like about this disc. The first 3 tracks do have that indie-pop lo-fi flavor. And Martin Leaper is in fine vocal form. But I feel the disc is a little too long on the repetitiveness of the farfisa organ, a sound which I generally like. And one song is so repetitious, you'll be reaching for the >> button like me. In general, the words are difficult to decipher (and not included), and I think that takes away a bit of the fun for me, again as compared to ""Golden Street,"" or, for that matter, ""Hooray For Tuesday"" as well! Hey, how do you follow-up to ""Golden Street"" anyway?"
3,"Great content, good picture, poor quality.","Although it's great to recall the great moments throughout these cups, it's very distracting to see scores of other games not yet reviewed, on the screen. The quality of the production is poor but I give it 3 stars because of the content. The narration isn't that great either, he keeps repeating the same phrases."
4,Good stuff,"Might need audio tracks in other languages, but it's very good to see those pictures, no matter the language."
5,Old recording found of Peter abd the Wolf,"The record was as described. The seller listed some minor scratches on one side and sme more on the second side. I was most interested in the Peter and The Wolf side. That side played beautiful with barly noticing the scratches. The second side the scratched were more noticeable but tolorable. As i said before, side one was the story I was looking for."
5,sonic piball combo party pack,the game is a lot of fun. i am real pleased with the purchase. its a game for all ages to enjoy.this game isnt too difficult or too easy. its just pure game enjoyment. i would highly recommend buying this game.
2,BGM is annoying,"For those of you who hate background music, this game is not foryou. There is no option to tun it off, and it is peppy and fast mostly.It is cool though, just have to play with sound off. I have to stayaway from these games cause if I cant hear sound effects without music,I hate it. This is the case here."
1,They Don't Work on My iMac,"For whatever reason, these don't work on my iMac (dual intel core), using OS 10.4.11. They don't appear on the desktop at all. When viewed through Disk Utility, I'm told that they are ""readable"" only, & that I can't write to them. When inserting one of these CDs, iTunes is opened automatically (that's not a problem), but when burning music to them & re-inserting the CD later, the CD again does not appear on the desktop, & the CD is no longer recognizable by iTunes! I have other types of Memorex CDs (CD-R type) & they work fine with my computer, but not these. Be wary of them if you have a similar iMac. They might work for you, & they might not! I'm now looking for a CD-RW that works with my computer."
5,Memorex 80 Minute CD-RW 4x-12x High Speed 25 Pack Spindle,"Product was new as described, Excellent High Speed Media. The seller was quick and reasonably priced. Excellent product and supplier."
2,"BUYER BEWARE!. This CD-RW DOES NOT have the ""Digital Recording"" rating seen in the stamp ""Compact disc Recordable""","Good blank CD for computer data recording. This CD-RW DOES NOT have the ""DIGITAL RECORDING"" rating seen in the usual stamp ""Compact disc Recordable."" BUYER BEWARE. I purchased a TEAC Album to CD recordable system, model GF-450K7 and it requires a specific type of blank recordable CD to record properly. I mistakenly ordered this type."
2,Had to buy whole new set of Discs,"Capacity wasn't even close to what it says.I don't have the discs with me now, but they are supposed to have 7xx MB of space on the disc.The ones I received had 560 MB (I'm estimating high...I know it wasn't lower than 540MB though)I only needed 640MB of space so I bought these knowing I probably wouldn't get the capacity that it said, but confident that they would be enough to store my file.Sadly, it wasn't even close.Was forced to buy a whole new pack of larger discs.Complete waste of my money.I have no use for these discs now since I store all my media on Flash Drives and backup HD's.No problem with Amazon though, they delivered it on time and safely packaged.2 Stars for falsely stating a larger capacity, but not 1 Star because the product was in excellent condition and they appear to function properly*The 640MB file was an ISO image I was burning to the disc, otherwise I would have just split up the files*"
4,strangely compelling,"Barry Hannah is the most successful graduate of the English Department at Mississippi College, however, you will be hard-pressed to find his name mentioned there today. The main reason is this book. This book is largely an autobiography of Hannah, and who knows how much of it is true? The college in the book is Mississippi College, and Hannah's criticisms are honest and embellishing, as are the other observations that he makes in this journey of a book. Geronimo Rex is strangely compelling, and Hannah pulled me right into his head as he tells this story of growing up in the world. Good book, and a must read for anyone from Mississippi College."
4,A must-have!,"Though a little dated now, Mr. Vallejo's book is no less informative now as it was when he was first making waves in the world of fantasy illustration. The techniques he espouses are useful and relevant to any illustrator, not just the ones in the genre. More than any other reference, this book kick-started my own fantasy illustration career. For me, Mr. Vallejo's most valuable lesson is that an artist's portfolio is only as strong as its weakest piece... which he so wonderfully demonstrates by combining his most dazzling work side-by-side with some of his earlier, not-so-spectacular work. A thousand thank-yous for this book, Mr. Vallejo!"
3,It&#65533;s good for what it is.,"Boris Vallejo has acquired quite a reputation for himself in the field of fantasy art. However, although his work is visually engaging and his skill is formidable, his artistic sense leaves something to be desired. This book is good reference if you want to paint like Boris, but I would recommend picking up Frazetta instead-compare the two and you'll see what I mean. Boris's figures are static and remarkably stationary; he paints a photograph, and the photograph captures a still, dead scene rather than a fluid motion. This book would fit on your shelf, and has some useful insight, but I recommend spending a couple extra bucks and picking up Frazetta's _Icon_ instead."
1,WTF??,"This is baaaad!! And not in a good way. Completely horrible. I've heard better rappers in my local bars. Artest is a joke. His track listing says it all, kinda funny. Some titles for his songs which are fitting for the album: 'Bad Karma', 'No Good', 'Why', 'I Like My Song'(well at least somebody does there Ron!) and 'Not Easy'(obviously not). Ha-Ha. He sucks!!"
1,dont quit your day job,This album is not good. If you got a lot of money you would think you could get hot beats on every track but that did not happend. To be honest I got 3 friends that are street rappers that are much better than this guy and a hood producer that got better beats. This is just a boring album and I would tell him get a ghost writter and a new producer. Don't waist your money.
3,It's OK...,"Well, the coloration is a bit exaggerated than what I received. It was yellowy and not the ""Aurora"" shade displayed on this and other Swarovski crystal items that had the ""Aurora"" stone.Not only was it exaggerated but it actually faded. I'm suspecting the color came off with mouthwash and I would recommend buying gem piercings with non-painted stones. The trouble is not being able to tell what is painted or not..."
3,OK for background. Out of date otherwise.,"This book was printied in 2004. Wiring and connection methods have chsnged significantly since then, so this is not a book for those looking to become current on wiring for new home automation devices and integration of systems. It is OK for getting the idea, but that's about it. It will sit on my shelf as a reference and will likely be donated to the Salvation Army Thrift Store in a year or so."
4,The perfect book to star .,"This manual explain everything about to star in a installation of a house. where do you can install the control panel, what kind of wire need to use, calculate how many outlet and feet of wire,etc.Very useful for me"
2,Old school,"I'm the owner of a home-automation company in California. We do structured wiring, amongst other things. I purchased this book to see whether there might be some tips or techniques that my company could use to improve the quality of work we do. After receiving the book and reading it, I was very disappointed. The schematics and designs employed by the author are ""old school."" The equipment and products he promotes are also ""old school."" The chapter on lighting control is notably outdated, almost as aged as the chapter on security systems.There are some basic principles of low-voltage that a beginner can learn from this book, such as wiring topographies and some of the tools of the trade, but those who work with these things everyday will be sorely disappointed with this book.My advice is to stay away from this book and purchase soemthing more current. Smart Homes for Dummies is not a bad option."
2,"Published in 2003, probably written much earlier","It is difficult to tell the intended audience for this book. Contractors or DIYers with tech aptitude will find little. Other reviewers have noted the poor type setting and layout, one of the things that jumped out at me was the use of 20 year old clip art. True, it is the content that matters and not the presentation, but the poor editing (i.e., place a phone jack near the TV service for ""Pay Preview"". Huh? ""preview"" what? Oh, it should read ""Pay per view"") and emphasis on specific hardware (Future Smart Panel and Stargate Controller) didn't provide me with anything useful. Considerable space is given to Stargate scripts, which should have been distributed electronically instead of on paper. I returned this book."
5,Tasty Treat,"Excellent read. Fast paced, gritty, tasty journey along the human span of cannibalism. Each chapter describes another sordid detail of where we came and how we got there."
4,Very Informative,I read this book in 2 days - it had a lot of interesting information about the subject. I also liked how every chapter was either a different time period in history or a different individual whose story was discussed. If you are looking for something unlike a history book but still informative - this one was great.
3,Just so-so,"The product is just ok. It is plastic, making it cheaper, but easy to clean. I think the brush for me is not as high quality as others, hence I do NOT use it. Same for the razor, I use a different razor. So while the stand functions well for keeping all the items in one place, I lose that ""everything matches' look and feel. Ah well. I do think it is overpriced for what it is."
5,An excellent blend of culinary history and biography,"Eat My Words isn't just a recipe collection; nor is it a survey of cookbook history: it reads between the lines of recipes through the ages to consider the women who developed them, from 17th century English estate housekeeping books to primers which encouraged women to educate themselves. Eat My Words is very highly recommended as an excellent blend of culinary history and biography."
2,So much from too little,"This book was a great disappointment to me. The author has fallen into the trap of reading what she needs from her sources, whether they provide the evidence she wants or not. I will admit I couldn't finish the first chapter and it may improve further along, but her rational for her conclusions escapes me. The handwritten recipe books/journals/scrapbooks she studied could have provided a fascinating look at how women's lives and priorities have changed over the centuries, but her insistence on broad societal conclusions from these very personal documents left me cold. When she directly discussed the documents and individuals she did a wonderful job, but when she tried to apply to the society at large their was a huge gap between her evidence and her conclusions."
3,Great for Nostalgics,"I bought to use for a racing promotion for my company. We played, along with the actual movie, back-to-back in our customer reception area. Lots of trivial and VERY interesting details on how the movie was made. My customers and I enjoyed watching (and learning) very much."
2,Misleading Cover,Well I bought this movie in a bargain bin and I'm glad I didn't pay more for it. I was expecting a nice family movie with lots of funny animal action.Well...there was a dog and an ostrich in the movie....however....they played no major role whatsoever.What I got was an extremely hard to follow dialect with a weak story line at best. I may not be refined enough to appreciate this movie.It is not a children's movie to be sure.
2,Daddy???,"I have loved every book I've read by Medeiros, but this one just didn't sweep me away. It seemed to lack her usual humor and I found the characters to be rather stilted and tiresome (not to mention annoying - as in Emily being a girlish brat!). I felt sorry for poor old Justin. The book bordered on being ""sick"" in that whole ""daddy"" way. I mean, come on, if Justin had gone back to fetch Emily right away when she was a child, he certainly would have been more ""fatherly"" to his ward and probably would not have bedded her when she was of age! (But then we wouldn't have a book, either.) I actually love romances between an older, graying man and a younger woman, but this seemed to push the envelope a little."
3,Not as good as some of her others,"I love TM's books, but this one didn't do it for me. The first half was sweet, with very tender moments between the characters, but when they were in London, things kept shifting from one crisis and mood swing to another. When they finally did ""get together"" it seemed rushed and unhappy. Try reading ""Nobody's Darling"" or ""Breath of Magic"" to really appreciate the talent of TM."
3,Alright,"This one started off good. Then it sort of dragged on. The hero started out as this sexy guy, then he became a big dork. It is just alright like bla bla bla."
2,A Little Princess rated PG-13,"I'm sorry, but after enjoying Teresa Medeiros' ""Fairest of them All,"" ""Whisper of Roses"" and ""Charming the Prince,"" ""Once an Angel"" was little more than a ripoff of Frances Hodgson Burnett's children's classic, ""A Little Princess,"" told for more mature readers. She even copied Shirley Temple's portrayal with her heroine's moppet looks and locks. Emily Claire has a wicked school mistress, true-blue servant friends, and she eventually finds out she really wasn't impoverished after all, nor had her father's friend abandoned her. Sound familiar? Add some tropical beaches, dangerous natives and sex, and you've whipped ""A Little Princess"" into ""Once an Angel."" Stick to some of Medeiros' other books, where she is funny, clever, surprising - and original."
3,Didn't live up to what I expected from TM,"I had really high hopes starting this book. I really enjoyed Yours Until Dawn, so I thought I would feel the same way about this book... not so. Don't get me wrong, I liked the book, it was an average story, but it is going to the Used Book Store as a trade in. Some of the antics the heroine does makes her hard to like and some of the story was just too far out there. This story is in 2 parts, the first was a bit slow, 2nd was much better. I am not giving up on Teresa Medeiros."
5,This book made me laugh so hard.,"I can't believe this book. I have had it for a couple of years and have reread it numerous times. Oh, how can lobsters hanging off someones pantaloons be so funny? I love this book. It made me feel what the characters were going through. The feelings I felt were great you can't put down this book as with almost all of Teresa Medeiros's books she is a great author."
5,cool.....,"this is a great effort.i play this disc over and over.it is a fine representation of the style of that time,hell it is a fine work period.if you like this style of music you will not be disappointed.while i am late to the sonny clark party,i am happy that i have finally arrived."
4,Art Farmer on trumpet here,Art makes a rare appearance. This disc is a favorite over in Japan. I have the original 16 bit version haven't heard this new remaster.
5,Lots of nuts and bolts,"The essays are short and to the point. Since they are first person accounts, we get to read the real nuts and bolts of these situations. I was disappointed with the 'Worst-case scenario' series which attempts something similar, but all written in second person. Esquire's essays are far more interesting and I found more than 80% of them appealing."
3,"Amusing, but rarely enlightening","A varied collection of short pieces - humourous in places, but for the most part an unenlightening read.. this left me with many unanswered questions, and I'll continue to rely on my imagination to know ""what it feels like to..."" in most cases"
1,"If this is your idea of humor, you're definitely sick","I saw this book in the humor section of a bookstore. The first ""chapter"" talks about what it feels like to be struck by lightning. My sister was killed by lightning, so obviously I don't see any humor in that. Other ""chapters"" talk about being shot in the head, being gored by a bull and having leprosy. Do people find these things to be funny? There might be a place for this book in a bookstore (and on Amazon), but the humor section is not the place."
1,A Horrible Game,Novastorm is a shooter with some very cool space and planet landscapes. But the ship is absolutely unresponsive! It's easy to bump into things that can kill you and it's very hard to find the things that you're supposed to shoot! There are no FMV sequences either! DO NOT BUY!!!
3,buy the album not this single,"As a fan of Bjork i still enjoyed this single, but i feel its for your collection only. I agree with the other reviewer; the single is fantastic, the remixes are too much, too sketchy and too irratic even for BJORK! She is a fantastic and fresh artist, but this single was dissapointing. The title track still gets 3 stars ***"
3,Interesting,"I love the song HYPERBALLAD, but I'm not too crazy about the remixes on this single. First, only the edited version of the song is available on the single, which completely cuts out the beautiful instrumental ending of the Album version. Second, many of the remixes merely place the HYPERBALLAD vocals on top of some other beat that has nothing to do with the song. I wouldn't mind this if they would only create a corresponding chord structure to the remix. The two most interesting mixes are the Robin Hood Mix and the Towa Tei Mix. These two manage to at least be creative while staying true to the musical aesthetic of the song. I would only recommend buying this single if you are a diehard Bjork fan."
4,If you are a singles kind of person.....,"The Hyper-ballad remains to be my all time favourite song. This single (I have 3 versions) contains some really good remixes. My fav would have to be the ""Subtle Abuse Mix"" and the ""Towa Tei Choice Mix"". If you can skip past the annoying sound of the ""David Morales Classic Mix"", with it's tinny, cheezy sounding piano, the rest of the remixes are great. Bring this one to a party and watch what happens! :)"
2,"Twix-Chocolate Carmel Cookie Bars, 36ct","I guess you could sum it up by saying, ""you get what you pay for."" While it was a good price for the product and it was shipped and received in a timely manner, the product itself tasted less than fresh. So far, the cookie/candy bars that we've had have had an after-taste of an unfresh product."
1,Stale? Terrible!,"It was still within the expiration date but they tasted awful. The caramel in it was very hard and chewy, not at all pleasant. They were all ""squashed"" like they had been under a heavy weight or something, yet the box showed no indication. Some had a really chemically taste.Bought a box before and the candy was fine, was really disappointed this time."
5,This is an awesome CD.,"If you like serious fushion with a touch of afro cuban, than don't hesitate buying this CD."
4,Nice,These look great on. They are not large but you can see the color. They work great in my kitchen work. Thanks for a great product at a good price.
1,Way too tiny.,I got this item for a gift for my sister and they seem to be a good size in the picture but when they came they we're smaller then an earring back.
2,Not good quality...,"I have attached rear trailing arm bushes and rear knuckle bushings,so I will report them.Front lower arm bushings are not attached yet,and I might report them later.Rear trailing arm bushings are NOT good.Their urethane parts are longer(thicker) than metal sleeve and prevent smooth movement,so I had to scrape off urethane parts.(see figure in ttp://minkara.carview.co.jp/userid/222963/car/389933/2185806/note.aspx ;sorry Japanese only)And notice that rear sway bar bushings did not fit my 2004 WRX STI(Blobeye,JPN).It seems to fit 2002(Bugeye).This kit is not so expensive,but it is not so good for me."
4,fine trio outing with Hank Jones,"Although ""The Essence"" was recorded under the leadership of bassist Ray Drummond, who may have picked the tunes and worked out the arrangements, it's really more of a trio outing headed up by pianist Hank Jones. The group is well balanced and plays as a synthesized unit, as a true trio should - in other words no extended solos featuring bass or drums. The mix of standards and a couple of originals is beautifully played; the recorded sound is exemplary.This is one of three fine albums Hank Jones made in 1989-90, the other two beingLazy AfternoonandOracle, both of which are more inspired than ""The Essence."" This is still a fine trio album which I would recommend if you can pick up an inexpensive copy."
3,More a review of Amazon that the shoe. . .,"Why, you might ask? Well, simply because they tout this as a men's shoe and then stop short of stocking 'mens' sizes. . . I mean, no offense to the mammoth gents that wear a size 3, but c'mon! MEDIAN size for men in this country is 10.5 and that's half a size shy of where Amazon draws the line.Very disappointing. I really like the look of this shoe. . . Guess I'll take my size 12 wearing self elsewhere. . ."
2,Not what we are used to,"Recording seems unbalanced - heavy on bass, treble range is weak.This is a small scale performance with the bare minimum number of pieces and a small chorus.Perhaps this is more ""accurate"" in a period sense than the Geza Oberfrank Naxos recording we have grown to know and love but it fails to stir the soul."
1,Cute online...,These were cute online but I wasn't able to see if they were cute on my feet because I couldn't get my foot into the very small opening and was not willing to break my ankle trying so I returned them. They seemed like a nice boot though.
4,Love it but,"This album starts out great but after about half way through it seams kind of rushed ,still I am glad I finely added it to my collection !"
5,Outstanding disc,"The boys prove themselves to be great once again on this disc. These aren't mere covers: they actually manage to put their own spin on established classics. claiming them as their own. Never mind all the bad metal groups trying to put on ""evil"" airs -the Whigs are downright sinister in their coolness. Literate,witty, everything Morrissey would be if he ever got over himself. Rank among the Placemats as the greatest real bands."
4,Early brilliance,"1992s 'Uptown Avondale' is the first thing the Afghan Whigs released after their debut 1989 album, 'Up in It'. This EP screams the thing which that album only implied under its grungy exterior - and that is that these boys were driven by 60s soul, not by a desire to be lumped in with the grunge movement. It is the first time that you notice they are truly unique.The production is basic and raw, but the commitment, passion and attitude soars as Greg Dulli croons over cool dirgy takes on 'Band of Gold' (made famous by Freda Payne), 'True Love Travels on a Gravel Road' (Elvis Presley), 'Come See About Me' (The Supremes) and Al Green's 'Beware'. The five song set ends with Greg Dulli's ode to Miles Davis, here entitled 'Rebirth of the Cool, which resurfaces as a rerecorded bonus track on the CD of the album 'Congregation', which was released later that year.A must for Afghan Whigs or Greg Dulli fans."
2,not described well,these are heavy duty extra wide wiper refills. they will not fit in a standard car wiper blade. this information should have been part of the description.
3,"As promised, but with spam","The battery I ordered arrived as promised but I can't seem to get off their spam,..er 'advertising' list."
3,Sink Saddle,"Rubbermaid products have been part of my kitchen for decades, and I have always been completely satisfied. However, this product is way stiffer than previous sink saddles, and the suction cups that are supposed to attach it to the sink do not seem to work. I am giving it a break in period in hopes that it will soften from use."
5,A Great Classic-Original,"This is a great classic jazz guitar instrumental. Original in flavor and very soulful. Got it at ""THE"" absolute best price and shipping was extremely quick. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
2,"Everything on this is decent, EXCEPT the vocals","The beginnings of these songs aren't that bad, but when the vocals come in, it's ruined. Chris sounds like he's out of breath and trying to force the words out(lay off the pot). One thing that I think Six Feet Under should do is get a second guitarist. If you want to get a good metal tribute/cover album, get Iced Earth's Tribute to the Gods."
2,A star for likeing AC/DC and a second for learning their songs.,"I say whats important first, Six Feet Under is not death metal. Now then lets review. AC/DC let loose on a lil ditty known as Back in Black, and quite the succsesful impact it made. I give thanks to SFU for having the DC love, but keep it in your living room, DC wasn't ment to be heard this way. Though if a jr. higher is looking for a groove to impress with here you go. Maybe you'll get lucky and pick up on classic rock. But hopefully you will grow out of the umm pop rock stage that Six Feet Under has been crowned the apitimy of since 1995."
5,WHOA chris BARNES!!!!!!!!!1111,"I can't describe to you how good and trippy this album is. If you like to get stoned I recommend you buy this disc, it is awesome. I never liked AC/DC before but after I heard this I find myself able to tolerate a little bit of AC/DC now. This CD is just plain awesome, groovy and the vox are brutal. Just chill back, light one up, and listen to this album. Six Feet Under are the kings of stoner death metal."
4,S.F.U. redoing Ac/Dc's 'Back In Black' album?,"I love the idea of SFU redoing Back In Black. And I love the fact that they did it 10 times better than Ac/Dc did.I do like Ac/Dc, but SFU have outdone them on this one.If you're a SFU fan I would strongly recommend buying this one.If you're not a SFU fan go play hide and go [...] yourself"
3,Hey... AC/DC!,"While the music itself did not hit me all that much, I must give respect and credit to Six Feet Under for doing something unique. Damn it if there are a trillion or more gore metal bands on earth; all that violence gets boring really fast. But SFU has halted that for a while to cover their roots, and this album is exculively AC/DC covers. They sound rather strange in death metal form, but as I said before, this is original. So if you like death metal, but are sick of the ultra-violent crap, give this a try."
5,great from acdc only one who could make it great in death is sfu,great blast from the past. sfu did a great job on this one and all there throw backs from the past.thanks for the shipping fast Alarz
1,what,"this was the baddest idea ever in the history of bad ideas. one cover is admiration. this is writer's block,stealing and a whole bunch of other things i am sure amazon would not approve of. if anybody reads this far this is a waste of disc."
2,"Despite nostalgia, still a poor game","There is no doubt that Final Fantasy Legend (SaGa in Japan, billed as Final Fantasy in the United States to boost sales) was a highly advanced game for its time (1989). However, it offers nothing that its sequel doesn't offer, and the game is, shall we say, very poor. Not having the advantage of color that its contemporaries (Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy) had, the graphics are so poor that they were actually bad in 1989, which says a lot. The story is about as simplistic as they come, and you should be able to beat this game in a few hours no problem. Considering its limited availability now, I doubt anyone will really want to play this game - trust me, you aren't missing anything. My fellow ""old school"" RPG players will call me a heretic, but this game has nothing memorable to offer. Skip it."
4,Interesting,"Final Fantasy has quite a few games, and a couple of little series spun off the main franchise, such as Final Fantasy Tactics, and Legend is another one. It's unique in that you can customize your party, and power-ups work differently. Personally, I say that if you're starting out, you want 2 Humans (one male, one female) and a Mutant (I chose male) along with one Monster. Mutants level up on their own, but you can buy stats for your Humans, and you can change your Monster by feeding it the meat of other monsters so it's a different way of playing the game but fun.This game is a little short - you can finish it within one day, or a total of 24 hours spread out however long (even with working on leveling up) but for a Game Boy game and the debut of one of the Final Fantasy miniseries, this was actually a pretty decent game as a debut and laid out the groundwork for the rest of the series."
4,Wouldn't Know,"We wanted a leave-in thermometer for Thanksgiving and settled on this one. It looks robust (rather large - 5"" long and a large diameter head)...unfortunately, in Maine, delivery people put things in your garage if you leave it open, and this time, set it on top of my snowblower (totally random)...and so I didn't know it got delivered until after Thanksgiving. No fault of amazon, we should have known better, this has happened before with multiple companies since we moved to Maine 3 years ago.Anyway, it looks great...I have no doubts it will work as advertised. :)"
4,Cyberspace Engineers,"Engaging effort, with some of the best vox samples I've ever heard. Adi Newton's nicotine-ravaged voice has precisely the kind of detached edginess suited for technocratic anthems to cyberspace engineers. Definitely recommended for fans of Kraftwerk, Cabaret Voltaire, Wire and Throbbing Gristle. Electro-Mechanical-Chemical-Organic-Industrial music for the well-oiled 21st century cyborg."
4,I'm the first!,"Well, I liked the song it is catchy and sticks in your mind. I really like the lyrics and the song is haunting, sad and inspirational all at the same time. Well done Tracy Chapman"
3,It's only a 10/100 linq,"The J&R; Electronics/Amazon description correctly states that it is only a 10/100Mb/s cable but the packaging does not specify that.The Cat5e, 350MHz specs may lead you to believe that it may work on for a 1000Mb/s connection. It didn't for me. My switch and integrated NIC only negotiated a 100Mb/s connection when a regular Cat5e patch cable allows 1000Mb/s.The housing was surprisingly thick at almost 3/4 of an inch. The winding mechanism has several stops so you don't have to fully extract the cable."
3,Convenient but not road-hardened,"Very convenient to keep in your travel kit for those just-in-case events where only wired ethernet is available or hotel staff can't figure out why the wireless doesn't work. The vendor should get a clue that a road warrior oriented item like this has to be of more durable build. I've gone through several -- either the ratchet breaks, or one of the connectors goes wonky, or something else. Five stars for concept and convenience and one star for durability averages out to three stars."
3,Prone to Damage,"This worked fine for a while, but then the clip on one of ethernet jacks broke off, which makes it useless because it won't stay plugged in. This is a great idea, but the manufacturer should have added boots to protect the plastic clips. You only find boots on higher quality ethernet cables and for permanently connected cables left in place they're superfluous. In this case because the cable gets a lot of abuse while traveling, a boot is nearly required for longevity. Additionally, the housing is quite a bit bigger than I was expecting. I'm not a fan of Belkin, but I'm going to try their version which is obviously smaller and less than half the price on Amazon. It was fine for the few weeks it lasted, but not worth the price for the amount of use I got out of it."
3,poor confusing service from cables unlimited,product ok service not good . 2 items not correct more to ship back than product.
2,Okay,"It worked great out of the box. I dropped it once, not even that hard (2-3 ft) and now it won't lock. It does not have any protectors on the tabs on the connectors so they can and have gotten bent.It is a very nice length. The cable itself is very flat but sturdy. You would have to be trying hard to tear the cord. The connectors and body of the cord are very strong too and won't be cracked or crushed."
1,Not as good as a $5 fishing reel,"This cable reel suffers from binding and jamming if you do not carefully extend both ends at the same time. On retraction it will jam the majority of time it is difficult to execute a simultaneous retraction of both end, thus one side of the reel will bind (we fisherman call that a backlash).I connected this cable to 5 different devices, 3 computers (2 Dell, 1 Mac) and 2 printers (Brother and Canon). Four of the devices rejected the connection despite my reconnecting several times. This has been referred to in other submissions.In summary, this is a good idea poorly executed, I definitely would not travel with this thing. Save your money, look elsewhere."
3,average,"Unfortunately, one of the cables I purchased has already broken. That is why I bought two I guess. It is a good product in theory - but the plastic on the connectors is too thin - I anticipate the second one to fail. I recommend going with a higher quality short cable for travel."
5,Great debut album,"My favorite song is ""Flash"", because it talks about that things can happen that you want to remember and taking a picture helps remembering. I definitely recommend others to buy CD. Lyrics on all tracks are great. This album appeals to everyone in the family including my eight year old daugther that really likes the album."
1,Aggravated and disgusted,"I bought this cleaning kit as a Christmas Gift for my husband. I should have known better. There are no brushes included, which may have been an oversight on my part, however, one of the bottles for cleaning is missing. I didn't open the package since I was trying to keep it as a surprise. And to top this off, I can't return the item through Amazon because the products inside are labeled hazardous. There is also no option to contact the seller. So if you are the seller and read this, I would very much like a refund for this product, or send the cleaning solutions. I feel very much ripped off even if it was 14.00, because I didn't get what I paid for."
3,Not as it seemed,"Was mistaken in thinking a cleaning kit should have come with the brushes necessary to actually clean the gun. This is a product that was not as complete as I thought it would have been. Misread on my part, but happy with what it did come with."
5,Not bad considering the price,"A pretty basic kit that has everything you need for cleaning a rifle which is why I purchased it. Since the description states that one brush is included for a pistol (more than likely an error), I made sure to have a few at hand and have nothing to complain about. Pretty good considering the price alone."
1,Loads of (unintended) laughs!,"The writer's grasp (or lack thereof) of international history so pathetically limits his ability to command any real narrative in this tale of 'the boy next door' turning into a superhero.If you want to write screenplays, then stick to writing screenplays. EPSILON reads like a rejected movie premise morphed weakly into a vaguely picturesque novel.All in all, not entertaining in the slightest ..."
1,"Ugh Ugh Ugh ... Me, Writer ... You, Reader ... Read Now!","The ideas and situations covered here and veritably lifted from other books (see the works of Asimov and Clancy as well as the masterful EE. Doc Smith for reasonable starting points). To imply that the writer elevates the comic-book-to-novel scenario is a tremendous disservice to the fields of literature as well as graphic novels. The characters are entirely one-dimensional with extraordinarily little sense of purpose, and the situations -- while remotely interesting -- remind readers immediately of the stellar works of Allistar McClain as well as Robert Ludlum.Perhaps the writer was stretching for such comparisons, but, in the sense that they appear to be loosely veiled (very loose, at that) comparisons.One plus is that EPSILON is, thankfully, a very quick read. It makes the pain, much like dental work, less intimidating."
5,Comic Book meets Tom Clancy,"I'm not a big comic book fan, but Epsilon may change that. Author John J. Rust blends a superhero story with a real down to earth, sometimes gritty, world. His interest in modern U.S. Military weapons and tactics clearly shows, keeping the reader's feet firmly planted on the ground, avoiding the usual pitfals associated with comic books shifting to the written medium. Epsilon is a very enjoyable read, and I plan on buying the sequel.On the point brought up by another reviewer, who Mr. Rust dedicates his book to has absolutly NO bearing on the quality of the book. It's nice to see someone show a close bond with thier parents."
1,Incomprehensibly bad,"An absolutely tepid ""superhero novel"" that has the feel of the 'writer's workshopped' syndrome. The plot, largely incoherent and unbelievable, belongs in a comic book ... or, better yet, a comic film, and then ... then ... it might've made sense. Otherwise, it's like the police officer says: ""Move along, there's nothing to see here."""
4,better than a kick in the balls,if you think helmet and pantera suck and system of a down is good you are severely retarded and should be committed
2,More like Pre-K Math,"This program might work for a child who is getting ready for kindergarten, but it is not up to par for a child who is entering first grade. I bought it for my 6 year old to use as a review between kindergarten and first grade. She completed the entire program in one sitting; I'd guess it took her less than 1/2 hour. It is NOT kindergarten level by any means. My young 4 year old was able to complete it without much effort, so even with a child a year away from starting kindergarten it was a waste of money."
3,This is the real deal...,"This is the real deal from Bob Minzer's band. My personal favorite was Mr. Funk. It is a swing style tune with a funk flavor in the bass line and in the trombone part.I think ""Mr. Funk"" might have reference to Dave Bergeron or the bass trombone player for their awesome solos on the recording."
3,Lots of Great Information; Not Well Organized,"I found this book to be very helpful in providing a frame of reference for understanding the Synoptic Gospels. The authors correctly point out that viewing the actions, teachings and events of an agrarian society from 2,000 years ago with our modern, industrial, individualistic point of view leaves a great deal of room for misunderstanding. However, I rate this book as 3 stars because of the structure. It is not really designed to be read cover to cover, because material is repeated over and over again, as similar events occur in Matthew, Mark & Luke. I think this work could be improved considerably if the authors made more liberal use of the academic convention of ""c.f."" I feel that it is serious reader abuse to ask one to read through a two-page exposition toward the end of the book that is a 90% literal repeat of an earlier section, in hopes of finding the one sentence that is new."
5,how did they see it,To really read the Gospels it is necessary to understand the world of the Gospel writers. This book opens up the customs and culture of the Mediterranean world of that time. Each Gospel is annotated with longer articles and more in-depth information indexed. Very helpful.
4,Interesting and succinct overview of the different native groups of Alaska,"""The Native People of Alaska"" by Steve Langdon is an interesting - although somewhat repetitive - look at the various native groups of Alaska. The book contains a short chapter for each large cultural-linguistic group (Aleuts, Northern Eskimos, Southern Eskimos, Athabascans, and Tlingit) and concludes with a chapter on the history of these people since their contact with Europeans in the late 1700s. Within each chapter he discusses the group's population, diet, technology, clothing, house types, social organization, belief system and a few other topics. The book is essentially an anthropological description in shortened form. If you're interested in learning about the native inhabitants of Alaska, this book does a good job of explaining things at a broad level."
1,very hard to read,"english is my fourth language, but i do read books in english all the time, because of endless variety and availability . this book is about very interesting stuff but written in least enjoyable english i ever happened to read. it's so dry, no life in it. it's almost impossible to chew thru the pages. i'm not sure i can finish it. probably will throw it away and will find another one about same suff, because i'm really into native alaskans history."
5,Attention Secret Of Mana fans:,"Final Fanatsy Adventure is actually a literal prequel to the 1993 SNES game Secret Of Mana. The series, known in Japan as Seiken Densetsu [""Holy Sword Legend""], actually began on the GameBoy back in 1991. Secret Of Mana is actually Seiken Densetsu 2. Seiken Densetsu 3 was never released outside of Japan. Oddly enough, the fourth game in the series was released in Japan not as Seiken Densetsu 4, but rather as ""Legend Of Mana""... though this is fitting, as it doesn't really bear much of a resemblance to the previous three games."
2,It's ok,"Well one this is boring. The only good part is killing sombody good in medusas cave. And two the battles stink. if your looking for a final fantasy game, I suggest you skip it, unless you want torture."
4,Ffadventure,good game. Played it when I was a kid. Reminds me of being a kid again. Showed up on time works like it should.
4,Great back up system,"I shoot weddings and as soon as possible after the wedding I will back up to this device and store them as far apart as possible. When I get home I back up to two hard drives and then burn a DVD. When my Sanho Hyperdrive fills up I back it up to still another portable hard drive. Whew! But it works great. Most of the time it is disconnected from a power source. I put the card in, press the 'X' and it does the rest. The Sanho has several functionality, including verify, but I just want to get them backed up as quickly as possible. An 8gig card takes about 20-25 minutes to backup. It is just one of my tools in making sure the one-of-a-kind digital images don't get lost."
3,Two great and hard to find b-sides,"I bought this single for the b-sides, but do enjoy the mixes as well:1 first of all, this is extended by only 20 seconds over the original, which is a little disappointing.2 a very hasty and guitar-oriented track; essence of 'Animal Rights' in this one. A good listen, but a little hard to take after a while.3/4 these two mixes are by Moby himself; they aren't altogether bad/good, interesting in their similarities, but said similarities also take away from them.5 another similar mix by another individual; more or less as good/bad as the first two.6 I personally prefer not to listen to this one much, on account of the original being so enjoyable in its own right, but that's just me. Still not a bad mix though.7 a typical moby-strumental: dramatically ambient, with some good percussion features, and long. My favorite track on this single, and well worth price.It's a shame Moby hadn't started his b-side collection trend a few years earlier."
1,Dog gone terrible,"Reading others comments, having two cocker spaniels, I purchased four blinkies, ""just in case."" On both dogs, the mechanism fell out of the casing ON THE FIRST WEARING. I have two left, but can't trust that they will remain intact, if my dogs are ever in danger."
2,Many Vendors,"I purchased a similar product a while back. Unlike this product, the first had an on/off button, came with extra batteries, and instructions. This product came with almost depleted batteries, no extra batteries, no instructions, and no on/off switch.The method of turning this product on and off involved screwing tightly or unscrewing the top portion (the light) from the bottom portion (the batteries). Unless the unscrewing was significant, the light sometimes turned on when attached to the dog's collar. But, if the unscrewing was enough to keep the light off, the top portion would loosen completely while attached to the dog's collar and fall off.Because the pictures of this product from each vendor looked alike, I mistakenly ordered this product. Conclusion: when ordering something from Amazon, always pay attention to the vendor and not just the picture of the product."
2,"Great light, poorly secured","Although the product description shows a spring-loaded keychain-type clip, the clip that it came with was an oversized, friction-based scissors-type. This came off of our dog's collar repeatedly. Tightening the center screw didn't help.While it's certainly easy enough to find the dropped light at night, this does make finding your dog markedly more difficult.Also, while the product description doesn't mention this, the package that arrived said ""sized for larger dogs."""
5,"Great product, highly recommended",This is the best collar light for walking at night. It is lightweight and very bright. I highly recommen it.
1,Waste of Money.,"The other reviewer was right on the money. I bought this software, learned how to use it, (simple enough) and spent time creating a multi-page site only to discover that it is impossible to publish. I tried publishing it through the links on the software but cannot. Of course you discover this only after paying for a site host. Now I have web space and no site to put there. I can build a site using the host supplied software so why did I pay for this? I can't give this any stronger negative feedback, this company are a bunch of thieves!"
2,Buy the real deal,"Like a previous review states, this was created by CoffeeCup Software. Unfortunately, this Cosmi-labeled version doesn't offer any updates/upgrades unlike the real deal (VisualSite Designer) sold by CoffeeCup. Between the two, you're better off buying the version that has already made great changes and continues to do so."
2,Headache Creator,"This software is not intuitive and comes with no support documentation to help you (other than the ""help"" within the program itself). If you have some experience using this sort of software, you can find ways to make it work. However, this software would NOT work with the FTP for my web hosting provider (a large, major hosting company). Cosmi's support page readily admits that it doesn't work with all FTP servers, and you may have to download a separate program so that you can upload your web site files. NOT cool, and a big headache. Yes, this is cheap, but if you are doing anything important on the web and need the ease of FTP that works, spend some extra money and get something reliable and reputable."
4,Well executed concept,"Really great interaction between a brass section and Dick Oatts. These guys nailed it. The opening track is a glowing introduction, and is well worth adding to your DMP collection if not for that alone.If you enjoy the works of Enoch Light or GRP's All Star Bands, you'll wholeheartedly enjoy this."
1,Full of misinformation,"There is no credible anti-vaccine stance. This book is full of misleading statistics and outright lies. All medicines including vaccines have risks, but those risks are much lower than the harm caused by catching the disease. The authors advocate deliberately putting infants, children and immune-compromised adults such as the elderly in harms way. If I could give this book zero stars, then I would."
5,A Classic that is Better than Most Modern Works,"Harry Stack Sullivan's work deserves to be read widely, and is an extremely important antidote to the pharmaceutical-crazy approaches to mental health that are so dominant in the modern world. This book can teach the reader a great deal about how to deal with the dynamics of a therapeutic interview--and more importantly how to understand conversations in general! This approach to understanding communication fits well with Bateson's excellent analyses of the power-dynamics of conversations, and with Laing's and Minuchin's analyses of what happens in familial communications. I think this book should be a MUST-READ before any M.D. or therapist enters the interview room. Along with offering important practical guidance, it can help alert you-as-therapist to ways in which your own issues are inappropriately undermining the therapeutic exchange."
3,An interesting book for those who wish to interpret it.,"This book contains several prophecies of the great Alchemist Paracelsus, written all in symbolic form. Thus, to interpret the meaning of the prophecies one must unravel what the symbolism in his words represents. He describes certain times and events as being ""like this"" or ""like that"" and you must try to unravel what the likeness really represents. Kind of like trying to interpret who the Anti-Christ will be given the description in the Bible, or decided what the grasshoppers are supposed to be, if not actual grasshoppers. An interesting book that might be fun to ponder and comtemplate the meaning of."
1,Replacing One Myth with Another,"How very nice that Goldberg can deconstruct tired, unsubstatiated feminist arguments. What good does it do if he replaces their falsehood with his own?Sure - most geniuses are men. Are most men men geniuses? NOT!Sure - most geniuses are men - but does that mean there are no female geniuses? NOT!Saying that men are inherently superior and fit for rulership because most gifted people are male (which begs the questions ""what defines gifted?"")is just as flawed as saying that men are inherently barbaric because most criminals are male."
1,Name that society??,"(In Africa, where I work...) Mende, Sherbro, Ibo, Yoruba, Asante... How many are needed?"
4,"Goldberg refutes feminist claims of ""nonpatriarchal"" societi","This is a mostly re-written and updated re-release of Goldberg's ""The Inevitability of Patriarchy,"" published in 1973. It neatly exposes the feminist' half-truths and downright untruths concerning supposed ""nonpatriarchal"" societies. All human societies, past and present, are patriarchal, and here Goldberg demonstrates convincingly the weaknesses and in some cases mendaciousness of feminist claims to the contrary.Much of the Marxist/feminist ranting against so-called ""biological determinism"" of the past 20 years has been an attempt to refute Goldberg, and it is extremely revealing that they have been unable to do so without misrepresenting his arguments. Here Prof. Goldberg replies to his Marxist/feminist critics, showing why biological factors are extremely likely to be the cause of the universality of human patriarchy, and why the purely environmentalist explanations fall short."
4,A definitive answer to the title question and all critiques.,"A word of warning: The title of this book is slightly deceptive, in that the answer to the question ""Why Men Rule"" occupies only a chapter or two of the book. The balance is spent patiently debunking each and every type of the multitude of invalid critiques that have been leveled at Mr. Goldberg's work over the years. He does a truly great job of this - indeed, this book could be used as a text on reasoning and logic. I recommend it highly for anyone who is rational enough to wonder at some of the fluff that has been foisted off on the public by the women's movement in recent years"
4,Well thought out piece of scholarship,"The ""gender-bender""'s bitching aside, Goldberg's arguements and research have been put forth by other scholars without a peep from ""scholars"" like Mr. SanFran..because the authors have been women. More essential reading then his personal interpretations, the summations of ""matriarchal"" cultures are fabulously iconoclastic, whether your intellectual sparing partner is an old school Merlin Stone ""When God was a Woman""-er, or a 90's Gimbutas-ite, or your anarchist utopian roomate... Despite the..uh..genderbenders comments, goldbergs conclusion is NOT that we SHOULD be under patriarchy, but coming to terms with what partiarchy is, and how much of human history and physiology we're up against when we work against it. He hardly makes note of some of the reasonable reasons for certain universal sex roles, any more than he argues for them or against them; again, thats not what this book is about. Sorry Mr.-bender.."
4,Watch out for the small keyboard buttons of this version,"My rating is for the older version.Hopefully they have discontinued this model to bring back the older version. My father enjoyes the older version of this game, but I need to find him a replacement and I don't think we would be able to use this keyboard."
2,a very BLAH product....,"My mom is an avid wheel of fortune fan, and for x-mas i thought i'd buy this for her since it reminded me of a wheel of fortune game we use to have. Man do i regret it. She NEVER plays it anymore. The puzzles are limited and will start to repeat within a few weeks. The keys on the keypad are hard to push in, and if you don't push it in right soon enough you lose your turn and the general game-play is blah. Really, if you bought this for someone, it's the kind of present that they'd be happy with for all of a few hours. Then they'd let it collect dust. Like my mum is =("
5,Love this game,My mother and I played many a game on this. The keys are a bit small and hard to navigate but that didn't stop us from playing multiple games at a sitting each day.
2,20th Anniversary letdown..,My daughter was thrilled to see a new Wheel of Fortune game out and we bought it immediately! It's quite abit smaller than the original..can't imagine why they would do that..and it already has problems with the bonus round! We may just have a bad one..but my daughter has gone back to using the 20 year old one she has..even with the faded screen and weak sound!
2,Kind Of Boring!,This Wheel Of Fortune toy is okay but its kind of boring. But then the game show is a little boring too!
3,$145????,I had this game when I was a kid and it was a lot of fun. Used it for long car trips and everything.But $145??????? Seriously???? Who would pay that????
3,wheres there phone number?,i got a wheel of fortune games from them and it worked a few days then locks up on certain keys im trying to get my money back but cant find a phone number for them what kind of bisness where you dont show a number to call will never order from them again
1,Screen is WAY too small,"Fun game, but even the kids have trouble reading the letters on the screen. I would not buy it again."
1,Ms. Chick,The monitor is too small - this game is not useful to me. I regret ordering it. I need a larger (screen)monitor and the keypad is too small.
3,"Fun, but not for the optically challenged!","This is an enjoyable game for anyone who loves the Wheel of Fortune TV gameshow. The game works well and seems to be sturdy enough. Two major complaints, however, are that 1) the screen and keyboard are a bit tough to read because the print is too small and 2) the wheel spaces are not labeled, meaning that when you electronically spin the wheel, you have no idea where you've landed until the dollar amount (or bankrupt or lose-a-turn) is displayed on the screen, which takes some of the fun out of the process."
2,Don't Buy,Good game but it does not have many words to play. Repeats the same words. Expensive too for what it does.
3,Hard to read the screen,"I love the way this game plays (just like the tv show), but the small screen and font on the screen make it hard to read. It's not illuminated either, so it's more frustrating than fun to play. Somewhat disappointed!"
2,"screen too dark, buttons too little","I purchased this for myself and my 7 year old to play with. The screen is way too dark to be able to use at dusk or after, but if in direct sunlight, you can't see it either.It's pretty small (buttons and screen) and a little confusing. If you are a person who is using hard earned money to purchase this, then don't. But if you just want to check it out and be okay with not wanting it later or losing the money you spent, go for it."
5,Good upgrade.,"Great OS. Had to upgrade from Tiger (10.4) to get access to core features required for upgrades of key software titles I use. Glad I did! The ability to easily view another 10.5 shared desktop is too cool. It was possible before, but nowhere near this easy."
2,Watch your network speed slow to a crawl,"No really. Do yourself a favor and search for ""airport extreme slow since leopard"". Its been out for quite some time and apple has not addressed this issue yet. If you can find thousands of reports of an error on the web, you can be sure many more people have the issue. So, I suggest waiting till Apple addresses (or even acknowledges) the issue. Oh, and your stability goes down as well. Get used to seeing that spinning pinwheel. Actually, its starting to remind me of my last Windows machine."
1,Disaster on powermac G5,This OS has turned a 100% reliable machine into a piece of junk. After installing my machine has had a problem with not staying in sleep mode. A few minutes after entering sleep mode the fan goes into high gear and it won't respond to anything other than holding down the power switch to turn it off. I have contacted Apple a number of times and it is still not fixed. One of the times they had me reinstall the OS wiping out my account and settings. It was better for a while but the sleep problem has returned. My reccomendation is wait until they really have it working.
1,Switched back to Tiger....,"First of all I thank Amazon for accepting my return of Leopard. It was available for pre-sale before the Min. Sys. Req. were available and I couldn't install it.I switched from Windows in 2002 soon after Jaguar when everyone else I knew thought Mac's were a piece of junk. I've been delighted with every OS from Apple until now. That said my disappointment in Leopard is as follows:Doesn't install on systems under 867MHZ. That's not a technical barrier, but a marketing decision. So much for Apple's statement to support Power PC's.Spotlight didn't find everything in the search field anymore. It was amazing under Tiger.I couldn't send POP mail anymore, I had to use HTML on the web. There was no problem under Tiger - I created the POP account in Mac Mail and entered the server names, without troubles afterward.There's no real need to get Leopard other than the new parental controls, which I thought were pretty good for keeping an eye your teenager. It tracks everything they do!"
4,a leopard in no tiger,"Apple Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopardwhile this is in many ways a wonderful os, and an elegant continuation of the apple mac os x tradition, the problems one encounters between leopard and hp printers is cause for concern. knowing what i have learned, i would have waited for printer updates before installing this program."
4,Great OS but had problems with passwords,"I installed Leopard without a problem and when tried downloading updates or was asked for my administrative name and password it would not accept it. Both solutions on the Apple site didn't work and had to take it to Apple's Genius bar at my Apple store. The new software took my password from the root folder to the firmware. They found and solved this problem for me. Download and install the Login & Keychain Update 1.0 for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard to avoid the issue later. It's at http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=106704. Also being a new OS it could have included more new desk tops, Other wise its another gem from Apple."
4,A Few Changes,"I purchased this shortly after it went to 10.5.1. Honestly I don't really see that much of a change. I mean; yes it looks a ""little"" better with the incorrectly rendered reflections on the doc.This edition feels like a small update to 10.4. Not so sure it was worth the money to get a little cleaner UI and a few small extra things like Time Machine and the loss of iLife applications like Garage Band, iPhoto and a few others that don't come to mind right now. To get these back I used my OEM DVD for 10.4 to re-install them."
