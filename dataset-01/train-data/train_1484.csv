4,cat health,"Found this product by recommendation from a vet, for an older cat with mouth problems. It has helped somewhat with her chewing, and since I have 8 cats, I feed all of them this powder at least 1 time per day. It does seem to help with hairball issues as well."
5,I love it!,"I use this at the animal shelter I volunteer at, with my own cats and with my feral cats I feed outside. I give it to the ferals everyday but only occasionally to my own cats, or when I hear some sneezing. It is safe to give to them everyday, though. You can put it in wet food or on dry food-I have even put it in pill pockets when I wanted to make sure a particular cat got it. With my ferals, I put food and lysine in a bag and shake it up and the lysine sticks to the food really well so I feel like it is spread evenly. Definitely use it for your ferals! It may seem expensive but you use so little that even the small container lasts a long time. I highly recommend it!"
3,Works well but tastes bad,"My cat has a chronic congestion problem that causes him to sneeze. This powder has been effective when he takes it, but he often refuses his food if the powder has been added. I had some success mixing the powder with CatSip, but he even refuses that now."
3,"For a picky eater, stick to the lysine treats","I have a cat who is not a very picky eater and I have had her eat the lysine treats quite readily in the past. I switched to this powder to save money and while she does eat it mostly she will try and leave some at the bottom of her bowl. I'm guessing a pickier cat would not eat it. It does however, work just as well as the treats in controlling her goopy eyes from herpes."
3,Good product but my cats like the paste better.,"My cats didn't love the powder. The smell is pretty awful, so you'd think that they would love it, but only 2 of them will eat it. They seem to like the gel/paste better. However, for those that will eat it, it seems to work really well! (BTW I am a veterinarian.)"
4,Health cats,"Cats had upper respitory problems and the veterinary office ask's for so much money I decided to try this powder, the cat's liked the taste of it and they got better. I really believe Vetoquinol helped them back to health."
5,The Best Stuff,"I got this for my cat,whom I got from the shelter. She was sneezing,hacking and lost her appitite. I tried the paste,it's good also,but she wouldn't eat her wet food with that in it. So I bought the powder. I sprinkle it into her dry food and she eats it. She is doing much better now. I even talked my dad into buying some for his cats."
5,Better than the liquid. Good 4 feline herpes.,"I have 2 adult cats with feline herpes. My male cat only has an occasional outbreak and really doesn't need this but my female has never gone a day of her life without at least one eye infected until I started her on this. I previously used the liquid and although it seemed to help keep her to only one eye infected (as opposed to both) thats about all it did. When I switched her to the powder in a couple weeks she finally had her first day with no eye herpes! Its been about a week now herpe free and her eyes look much better and she is sneezing a lot less. The powder tastes good to cats. Both of my cats like it. I highly recommend this stuff. I have been using this for about a month and my jar is still almost half full so it lasts longer than the liquid, too. A better deal for sure."
3,Viralys Powder,"I purchased this for an indoor/outdoor cat that adopted me. Kitty is FIV+ and tends to keep an upper resp. infection. I originally was purchasing the Lysine treats from my Vet which were 120 for $30. Considering I was giving Kitty 4/day (the max allowed) and his ""owner"" decided she suddenly wanted him, I wasn't comfortable leaving expensive treats outside hoping Kitty would get them (the birds started eating the food I was leaving out for him as well as other dogs/cats). So I found this poduct and purchased it.It's been almost a month, and although Kitty's eyes are clear, he is still raspy. The treats seemed to be more effective. But I also haven't compared the dosages to each other, so I probably need to adjust the powder to equal that of the 4 treats. Kitty also receives an oral immune booster prescribed by the vet - administered whenever I can get to him."
4,Good for Feline Herpes,I had previously been getting the Viralys gel from our vet. This powder version online was a much better price and less additives (just says Lysine in a flavor base). I've sprinkled it on hard and soft food and my kitties don't even seem to notice (I have 2) and one of them is very particular about his food. It took him awhile to get use to the gel.
4,Peaceful!!,"It is hard to come up with a yoga sound that is not too new agey. This almost makes it.If you like peaceful, serene sounds to accompany your yoga practice then I think you may like this one.I love tabla and this has quite a bit, plus whispering flutes, some synthesized pulse create a fusion of Indian, and American Folk create a calming background for anytime."
1,Childish,"As an author who wrote children's books. Holmes may be excused for treating its readers as totally ignorant, and thus suceptiible to his revisionist tracts on how great the British Army was.Only problem is, we are not fooled."
5,Titans GO!,"For anyone that's a fan of the Teen Titans - or for any devoted Batman fan - this toy is a must have! He says several different phrases, stands up by himself, and is oddly cuddly! Also, he has replacable batteries so there's no need to worry about wearing him out."
2,Review Response,"Very disappointing, as was Hooked on Big Bands. I was expecting the qualify of Hooked on Classics, but neither was even close. I'm donating both."
1,BEWARE - DEFINITELY NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS,"Pass this collection by . Apart from 4 tracks , all the songs have been re-recorded by the original artists . The result is a collection of old people trying to sound hip . They sound dreadful ! The collection contains 3 CDs but there only are 30 short ( but tedious ) songs so there is no reason to expand it to a ""box set"". One CD would suffice especially as the 3 of them are on their way to my trash can !"
5,BEST BALLAD EVER!,"Let me tell you something~ I hate ballads. I never listen to ballads. Hey! But right now I can make an exception. This is the best ballad ever and the best song that ever came out of SCLUB. The second song is a rap I can't stand.---------------I never had a dream come true, until the day that I found you, and even though that I pretend that I moved on, you'll always be-my baby----------------"
2,S Club 7,"Maybe I didn't read the fine print, but upon receipt of the CD, discovered it only had two tracks on it. Bought it ""used"". Will be returning to seller."
1,Never had a dream come true single,"I was quite disappointed when I received this and found it to be a copy. The sound wasnt quite as good as I expected it to be. Assuming that would be from numberous copies made.I won't order from this person again, as I feel he/she misrepresented what they were selling. If you are selling copies, simply state that."
1,extremely disappointed,"Bought this 2-bike trunk mount rack and i'm returning after two uses! First time i used it the 4 straps you to use attach it I put on the top and bottom of my trunk. I drove maybe 3 miles on city streets with just one bike and swayed from side to side and the rear wheel moved back with the wind. The second time I used it I put the top straps on the left and right side of the taillight part the trunk thinking that would solve the problem. At least it seemed tight. Driving 60 on the highway one bike bounced up and down the whole way!!! ""All"" trunk mount bike racks should have 6 straps to properly secure it to the vehicle!!!!"
1,Awful 1.5 hours and bikes still don't sit properly,"This is about the most worthless thing I've ever purchased, nearly 2 hours to get it set up so that it would hold the bikes without them sliding all over. The straps that are used to stitch down the bikes are flimsy and I can see on good hard bump in the road and them popping off. The mounts which you put your bike on have very shallow sides so the bikes literally slide right off them regardless of how tightly you cinch the straps down."
2,Flimsy,I picked this rack up at Target for $50. Setup is easy enough. But the buckles to tighten the strap are flimsy and don't seem to stay tight for very long. Also the plastic straps that hold the bike are poorly designed. I'm taking it back to Target when I'm done writing this. Don't waste your money. Spend a little more and get something you won't need to worry about.
1,Straps come loose!!,"I purchased this rack to use on a Ford Escape. I mounted the rack and tightened the straps a tight as possible. After a brief drive the lower straps came completely off. I retightened them and continued. They came off again. They then came off a third time. I then went home dropped off my bikes, went to a bike store and bought a real bike rack. Don't trust your bikes to this rack!!"
1,Lost 0ver $600 in bikes,"I would give this rack negative numbers if possible. I mounted the rack on my car and attached it to my RV. We went 40 miles down the road and when we stopped for gas, the bikes and rack were gone. It had fallen off in traffic on the interstate. I lost over $600 inbikes plus the rack. DO NOT TRUST THIS RACK!!!"
2,Great for ONE Bike,"I purchased this rack for my Mazda3 hoping to transport 2 bikes at a time. Problem 1, my car has a spoiler. As I travel with it, the rack shifts a little and ends up rubbing against the spoiler, which obviously isn't good for the paint. Problem 2, two adult bikes will NOT fit on this rack. 1 adult bike and 1 kids bike might work, but definitely not 2 adult size bikes. Total fail with this purchase."
1,Waste of Your $$$$,"We decided to buy it because it was the most affordable bike carrier on this site but it is not worth the money or the effort setting it up.First of all the so call ""instruction manual"" was simply a few fuzzy pictures along with some short captions instead of detail steps.Second the structure lacks stability and it is out of cheap parts such as: Flimsy plastic straps meant to secure a 50 pound bike, nylon straps that can not prevent a bike from moving out of the holder, plastic holder that will move at sudden movements.And sadly after all this effort of configuring the 2 bike carrier we came to the conclusion that only ONE of our bikes can fit.Despite what the ""instruction manual"" told us the carrier can NOT hold women's bikes or ones that are over the speed bike's category (more than 25 pounds).It is obvious to say that we will be returning this product tomorrow.J&A;."
1,Didn't fit my car despite fitting guide saying it should,"I bought this rack at Target after checking the vehicle compatability guide, which said that it would fit my 1999 Buick Regal (special instructions to attach straps under the plastic bumper to the frame). When I tried to install the rack, the straps were not long enough to attach to the frame. Luckily I was able to return it."
1,Do not buy,I wouldn't give this one star if I had that choice. We bought this carrier when we bought new bikes. We installed it correctly and after driving only a few miles the straps holding one of the bikes detached and dropped my brand new $1200 bike to the ground. Buy this only if you do not care if your bikes fly off.
2,Doesn't do it on a Santa Fe,"Just like everyone else says, it loosens up almost immediately. Had to pull off the highway then put the bikes inside the car. Scarey."
2,Great if you're taking it to a local trail,"I bought the Schwinn Ranger bike and this rack. I didn't make it more than 10 miles from my place and the bike started slipping off. The straps don't hold anything but a standard bike in the brackets. I had to put the bike in my car in order to be able to make it to my destination. I had known Schwinn to make quality products, but am sadly disappointed with this rack."
1,Not good,"I bought this because it was Schwinn, and it was simply name recognition. Once the straps are tightened, the tension buckles do not remain so, and over time the straps will come loose from the car if left to their own devices. The straps must have too much play in them for the Florida weather because they don't stay tight on the car. Also not taken into account are the J hooks meant to keep the unit mounted/stabilized to the bottom of the trunk. They are not long enough to grip the trunk itself, instead hooking the plastic panel covering the trunk on my Saturn, warping it when the carrier is tightened. In addition, the straps that wrap around a bike's top tube and affix it to the rack are made of a flimsy plastic which has a tendency to come unsnapped as the bikes sway. This rack was purchased from my local Target store."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS RACK,I purchased this rack to carry two bikes and all it took was one patch of bad road and it bent my trunk so bad that I can't latch my trunk anymore.
1,Don't Waste Your Time.,"I would give this no stars if possible. Held the bikes fine, but the rack did not stay on the car. We had to pull over several times to tighten the straps. Eventually, we got SO frustrated that we took the bikes off the rack, took the wheels off and put them in the car! HUGE waste of time and money. Do not buy this product!"
4,Bonus,"To be honest, the reason I bought this book was it came with a small pair of gardening gloves, which my tiny gardening apprentice (aged 5) could don when he ""helped"" in the garden.Then I had a look at the book, and it is good. It has some good basic growing thing projects for kids - eg planting a window box, growing a runner bean in a jar.Good for parents to give them ideas and to read with kids- I don't really think the age group that would be interested in these activities would read it independently!Beautiful illustrations in the sharp photographic house-style of Dorling Kindersley."
5,The most tasteful compilation of the British chanteuse,"Petula Clark is more than well represented in this mostly 60's 3 cd set.She shows her romantic and tuneful craftmanship on these A and B sides with some select cuts from her warner years.I found this 3 cd set broken into themes(each cd),as fresh as pop music comes. Her collaborator Tony Hatch is largely responsible for the creative original song writing. Petulas covers of Charlie Chaplin's ""Eternally"",""Smile"",and ""This is my song"" are romantic and deliciosly produced.You'll be going""uptown"" if you buy this beautiful set.It is collector colorful,and any Petula fan should be proud to own it!This cd set has so many hits it reminds one of Petulas clout as England's most popular female singers of the 60's.She rivals Dusty Springfield in her range and good taste in production."
2,Outdated,"Of course, the calendar makers couldn't foresee that Cutler would take over for Plummer, though that is a disincentive to buy this calendar. But it's inexcusable that Ashley Lelie is still featured on a month in this calendar. He left the team before the beginning of the season; they had plenty of time to change him out for Javon Walker. It's hard to want to buy a calendar with flaws such as these."
5,"Looks cheap, works well","This gizmo looks just like a 1970's era desk arm lamp, however it works very well even with a fairly heavy studio mike in upside down position. Once adjusted and locked in place it shakes with the desk, but everything stays put. The vibration does not transfer to the mic.Having the cables inside the rails makes it look cleaner as well.The only part of the whole thing I was a bit disappointed in was the screw type desk mount. It seemed to bend as I tightened it, but if I tightened it any less it would wobble on the desk, so if the part was stronger it would be perfect.It does come with a permanet screw-in mount as well, so that may be the way to go."
5,"Works great, just make sure you hook it up correctly","We received the first one for my elderly dad, and replaced it because we thought it was defective. Do read the instructions, the hookup sequence does matter. After the 2nd arrived and we had the same problem, we did read the directions and all was well. The first one worked correctly, too. It's a great device for the hard of hearing - I can now call my Dad without yelling and going hoarse afterward."
4,Birth of a legend,"If you are expecting the pristine quality of the early Columbia recordings, you may want to pass on this one. However, if you are a serious Byrds fan with a sense of history, you will enjoy it. ""In the Beginning"" offers a fascinating look at some of the very earliest sessions by one of the most influential bands of all time. This set of rehearsal and demo recordings provide a surprisingly listenable glimpse of The Byrds as they were striving to refine their sound. It also reaffirms Gene Clark's invaluable role as both songwriter and vocalist. The sincerity which is evident in all the performances more than compensates for the rough edges. Highly recommended for all serious Byrds fans!"
5,Gift for my boyfriend,I got this for my boyfriend for our 2 years anniversary. Quick shipping and the product was not broken and handled with great care! It look awesome and I know he will love it when I give it to him on the 24th!
1,Bad Design,You have to put a nut for a bolt into a plastic holder to install this rack onto the hitch. The plastic holder stripped after a few weeks and the whole rack can no longer be used! Do not buy this product. Waste of money!
1,Avoid!,"The first time we used this rack, the cam lock that lets the rack swing back for hatch access stripped and was unusable. Apparently the holes were not exactly aligned from the factory. The company that actually makes and warranties the rack (Saris Cycling group) said that they do not have parts for it anymore and that the rack model has been replaced. Our only option was to return it to Amazon. Amazon, as usual, was fantastic with the return. This rack, on the other hand, should be avoided!"
1,"Terrrible, No way, No Customer service!","All previews reviews are true, this hitch has a terrible design, the adaptor doesnt work and it breaks at the first use, Schwinn and the other company dont care about this product anymore!"
5,great whether good at mathematics or not,"The enthusiasm of the author for the subject comes through very clearly. He covers the history of magic squares and along with his obvious mathematical genius, he covers with great reverence the mystical and religious aspects of the subject. There is even a chapter that gives a number of methods for one to learn to make ""instant"" magic squares any time or place. The book is chock full of about every magic square, star, cube (or any other geometric construction) one could imagine. There are even tessaracts. Just looking at these magical constructs and making an effort to understand something about them is worth the price of admission. The book is so comprehensive on the subject that one could spend a very long time studying it-or one could benefit greatly by a good serious reading of it.William Swyter"
3,an editor please,This book contains print and mathematical errors. A cute book but because of the math misprints [I refuse to believe the author cannot add] a shoddy publication very uncharacteristic of Princeton
5,Richard L Scherbel,Understanding life and its meaning eludes us if we continually search for it because understanding and meaning come from within. Living in nothingness allows us to continually find pleasure in the present without the concerns of the past. Chuck's work provides a formula and inspires me to continually learn to live in the present. I will continue to look in the (W)hole and see God in myself.Richard ScherbelAuthorLife Moves On For The Living
1,You do NOT want to buy this Album,"Please note that all of the songs on this album are performed by the ""Countdown Singers"" not the original artists you might expect..."
1,What an incredible invasion of privacy!,Keanu Reeves is a very private person. He keeps his private live to himself. The fact that this disc even EXISTS is incredibly offensive and disturbing. I'm horrified.
4,"Easy to use, but Problematic Profile","This is easy to use and it collects everything on the first pass. You can use the brushes on hardwood, tile, as-well-as on carpet. For those, quick, company is coming good-looks pick-ups, this works well on getting up cat hair on carpets. However, for real carpet cleaning, DO NOT ABANDON your standard/true household vac for those serious cleaning efforts.Regarding smooth floor cleaning, my main complaints about this unit is not the quality of vac, rather, the high profile of the handle on the hand-held removeable unit of the body, and the fact that the vac handle (for the standing position) does not hinge low against the floor. The (hand-held) handle on the body is so high that it will not fit under beds and sofas. Now I still have to either get out the Filter Queen or the dust mop to get those cat hair/dust bunnies.Beyond that, it's still a great vac. It's easy to wash out the filter, let it dry, and your on your way again."
5,Great little vacuum,Bought about a month ago and is doing the job and more. Got it for the kitchen floor and bathroom rugs but it really picks up the dog hair from the plush carpet too! Stand alone feature is handy.
2,"Works great on carpets, but terrible on bare floors","I bought this because it is really quiet compared to my Eureka Mighty Mite (Mighty Mite = incredible suction power, but extremely loud). It picks up great on various carpeting. Although with longer shag like my bath mat, the powerbrush gets snagged on the shag. On hardwood or bare floors, it only seems to pick up fine particles like hair, fur or dirt. There isn't enough suction to pickup cat litter (I've used pine pellets) or particles larger that fine dirt. It cannot even pickup the smallest pebble. I am disappointed in this.I would try it again if it came in a 12 AMP version. Maybe then it would have more suction power."
1,Save your Money!!!,"I had an old Bissell that died and the model isn't made anymore. It worked Soooo good I though I would get another Bissell. There were two that I was looking at, the EasyVac and the 3106A FeatherWeight. I tried the EasyVac and all I can say is it is a piece of C--p!! Doesn't have enough suction to pick up a piece of dog food,which is what I use it for. My old one sucked them right up. I nexted tried the Featherweight as it looked more like my old one, no wheels, laid flat on floor. Works MUCH better than the EasyVac. For $20 bucks at walmart it's a much better deal.P"
4,Lot's Of Power For Such A Little Vacuum!,"Bissell Easy Vac is a great little vacuum, It cleans very well. There's just one little problem with it. It has such a short cord. Other then that it's a pretty powerful little vacuum."
2,Limited usefulness,"About all its useful for is getting pet hair up from bare floors - even then it leaves a lot of dirt behind, as evidenced by what I see on a dry swifer pad after using this as compared to using a dry swifer on the same floor after using our old canister vacuum.I cant imagine it does a good job on carpeting that has any kind of pile at all.Overall, not very powerful and disappointing considering some of the other positive reviews here (I guess everyone has different standards)."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be.,"I was disappointed in the EasyVac. It works well on bare floors but not on carpeting. I have two dogs and it doesn't pick up the dog hairs very well. Also, it doesn't transition easily from bare floor to area rugs. You have to pick it up to move it on to the rugs. The cord is way too short. For someone who has large rooms it would be a problem. Helga"
4,Small but mighty!,"I think every apartment that has wall to wall carpet should come with its own vacuum cleaner. Why should I have to spend $200-$400 on a decent machine to keep it clean? It's not my carpet. If it were up to me there'd be hard wood or tile in the whole place. The Bissell 3108 solves the problem. It may look like a weak electric broom but as soon as you plug it in you realize it's closer to being a muscle car than a econo car. It's way powerful. Unless you have a multilevel home with tons of wall to wall carpet or need a hepa filter, this machine should do you fine. Even better is that it acts as a hand vac too. Bissell did it right this time--cheap, well built, powerful and Amazon shipped for free! My only criticism is it would be nice if the handle folded down to make storing it a little easier as the average apartment does not have enough storage space."
2,Vac does not suck,"Very disappointed in the Bissell 3108 EasyVac Powerbrush. I purchased the product to clean my bare floors which are saltillo tile, ceramic, and brick. It would only pick up the smallest pieces of sand and some of the cat litter. Just did not have enough power to pick up much of anything. Bissell should not call this a POWER brush. It has no suction power."
2,No longer in production....,"Don't buy this for longevity. I have had mine for about 7 or 8 years and needed a drive belt. I called the Parts & Service number in the owner's manual. This model is no longer in production, and replacement parts for this model are no longer being made. The only hope is to find a local service center that might have older parts in stock. Bissell gave me a list of service centers in my area. I called the entire list to be told time after time...no parts available."
2,Don't bother,"The Bissell 3198 EasyVac Powerbrush does not have enough power to do large jobs and when you shut it off the dirt that is in the head falls out onto the surface you have just cleaned. It is OK for ""dust bunnies"" but does not have adequate power for sand or dirt."
3,"Good Suction, but...","For a light vac, this one has pretty good suction. However...Assembly/reassembly for different uses (one of this vac's selling points, Versatility) is a pain. Parts don't separate/go back together easily. If they did, its versatility would be an even bigger plus.Clean-up is NASTY. It's virtually impossible to completely get rid of accumulated hair and fibers, even micro-fine dust etc. on the filter cup.The dust flies right up your nose when you're emptying the cup. Needs a better filtration/emptying system."
1,"Each use, weakins it.","I received this Vac as a room hand-me-down; the previous owner used it for less than a year. I only have an area rug 6 by 4 feet to vac, which I vac once a week. The five times that I have used it, it has become increasingly more difficult, and has less powered than the previous. It is very loud and takes me 30 min to vac a small area. I have a Bissell upright at my house, and that's lasted me 2 years, still sucking up the smallest of dust particles."
1,not well designed,"The Bissell 3108 EasyVac Powerbrush seemed great on paper-- like a stick vac, but with a removeable handheld unit. I liked that it had a hose and the options for bare floor or carpet. I have mostly bare floors. Unfortunately I didn't realize it had a tiny dust cup which does not clean easily, so every time you need to empty the cup (which is at least every useage, sometimes 2x in one use, and I have a small house!), dust goes everywhere. You also have to clean out the filter with your fingers. Why bother vacuuming if you have to sweep up after yourself?Also, once the filter is at all dirty, the unit doesn't work anymore, you can roll over a crumb 10 times and it won't get sucked up. When you turn the vacuum off, whatever you vacuumed up last gets spit back out.I got so frustrated I went out and bought a SwifferVac and it works twice as well, which is really sad since it cost half as much and runs on batteries.I'm really disappointed."
1,She is a better singer then this,"I think American Idol proved how powerful her voice really is, and neither of her prior releases have done her justice.I hope now she makes music that compliments her talent.However, this is a good buy."
3,a long almost annoying process...,this is a good book to help you get started on dream interpretation but dont stop here. its a lot of steps and im still not really used to the process. could be more complete though...
4,enjoyable reading but not up to the author's high standards,"A young woman is placed into a lord's household as his temporary ward. Her tendency to pick up stray people and animals totally upsets his life and he feels drawn to her compassionate ways. Again Cindy Holbrook comes up with a nice set of characters and lots of jokes, but somehow this book didn't draw me in like most of her previous books (My all time favourite book - ""A Daring Deception"" by the same author - makes me both cry and laugh aloud everytime I read it)."
1,BUYER BEWARE - Contains non-original versions,"I purchased this CD because I saw that it had YOU GOT IT, Roy's late '80s comeback hit, packaged together with the older classics. This CD turned out to be a total disaster. All the tracks are non-original versions, either terrible remixes or live versions (of course the record company fails to mention this anywhere on the packaging). The new versions included here are aweful. They sound nothing like the original (familiar) versions, and instead like they were recorded on a karaoke machine or else by some terrible second-rate wedding band. Avoid at all costs!"
3,Great product but hassle with company ordered from.,"The poster is as I imagined and I am quite happy with the end result.Getting the correct poster was not as easy as it should have been. At first the wrong poster was sent and the company who shipped it claimed it was not their problem (apparently they ship for a different company who processed the order that they recieved through Amazon's marketplace). After numerous phone calls, voice mails, nobody stepping up, and total frustration, a manager finally said indeed, they would send me thee right one. Hallelujah! I felt like the enemy and all I was trying to do was purchase and receive the product I ordered. So, like i said, the poster is great. Clear display of meridians, easy to read, etc. but I will never order through that company again (BB Healthy & their shipping company)."
5,"no no, wait...","""think for yourself...and don't rely - on someone ELSE!""fall of 1989, 5.0 mustang, dark night, 4 of a kind playing on the tape deck...ehehhehehehehehehehe..."
1,Pure NOISE!,I don't know anyone can call this music. It's just screaming and let's see how fast I can play. This BLOWS!
2,More for the memories than the music,"I like D.R.I. but let's be for real: they're not that great of a band. Still, the nostalga-value is worth the price. Classic skater-thrash from the 80's. If you're going to get one D.R.I. disk, this is probably the one to get (despite the poor production). BTW, ""Think for Yourself"" is definatly the coolest song on the disc; probably the only one worthy of being called ""good."""
2,Meh... Don't buy it.,"It's better then the other tribute, but still pretty bad. Musically it's not bad, but most of the singing, makes me want to puke!! Theres only one good song.. Mexico.. It's sounds cool. But people please, save you money and go see incubus live or somthing. The people who disgraced the honerable Incubus need to be punished."
3,Not True to Size!,"Charles David Women's Aubrey BootThese boots have nice leather. The foot is weak and feels like it might crack between ball and heel. My main complaint is that they are not true to size. I purchased a 11M and I wear between a 10 and 11 medium. I am not obese. They should have fit. They did not. They are pull-on boots. I can pull them on, but after they clear my heel there is not enough room left. Back they go!"
3,Green Age of Asher Witherow,"Beautiful prose and some interesting flirtations with nineteenth-century philosophy. For me, though, in the end there's not enough story here to make the book memorable.All the events affecting the characters and the little mining town in which they live are disastrous, to the point of caricature, and none of them seem to be brought about by protagonist choices or actions; even the vividly described death of a boy in a mine and an accidental pregnancy seem like the results of some looming, inexplicably malevolent Fate. The narrative style in which the story is told by the main character late in life ensures that we know he survives. The beauty of the sentence-level style masks the problems with the plot to some extent but doesn't, in the end, conceal its general pointlessness."
5,An up-to-date presentation,"Emma Curtis Hopkins was known as the ""teacher of teachers"". She was the teacher of Nona Brooks, co-founder of Divine Science, Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, co-founders of Unity, and Ernest Holmes, founder of Religious Science (Science of Mind), among others.Her teachings break down into 12 basic ideas, which all of her readily available writings cover at various depths. Some people have trouble with her Victorian style of writing, and this book corrects that problem.This is a clear and concise presentation of her basic teachings and is well presented for the modern reader. Exercises are included as well as Ms. Hopkins suggestions for daily spiritual practice.For those who would like to read the originals, try her Scientific Christian Mental Practice, which is more accessable than her High Mysticism."
1,Unfaithful to original work,"I disagree with the other reviews. Emma Curtis Hopkins was an awesome teacher indeed. The difficulty for many in reading her writings is not the english, but rather that her work is mystical. The new rendering, while an impressive effort, is somewhat akin to a Readers Digest condensation. The message is often lost or confused.I implore Truth students to read Ms Hopkins in her orignal language - not through the filter of someone else who may or may not comprehend her true meaning."
5,Old Time Fiddle Master,Tommy Jarrell has been a source of inspiration for old time fiddlers for generations. These CD collections demonstrate why his heartfelt dedication to his music is so infectuous. These tunes are classics.
4,Fine work for learning to know and love the poet of piano,"I must confess that at the begining I felt a little awkward, as if I were prying in the most intimate details of the life of this great composer, but Siepmann knows wisely how to separe, to analyse and then to combine again this two aspects of his life: the man and the musician, to shows us how both aspects explain to each other. Besides the author gives us a great deal of complementary information, as a calendar of Chopin's life an times, a list of the best pianists who played and recorded his marveluos music and another list in which he includes a brief biography of some people named in the book and that were of some influence in the life of our ""hero"". And of course, a lot of photos and documents, so I egarly recomend this book."
3,Hillbilly Cat's Best,"Carl Perkins was a Hillbilly that did some of the first ""rock-a-billy"" music. This cd is his best. Carl was one of the SUN RECORD originals and songs like ""Matchbox"", ""Dixie Fried"", Your True Love"" and ""Honey Don't"" show how great his talents really were. He was the man that recorded and wrote ""Blue Suede Shoes"" that even today sounds a fresh as the day it was recorded some 45 years ago. To get a real history lesson in American ""Pop Culture"", this is one of the packages you must buy. CARL PERKINS WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED FOR HIS RED NECK, HILLBILLY, ROCK'N ROLL MUSIC....HE WAS GREAT!!!!"
4,Pure rock-a-billy,"There's no doubt (at least in Carl's mind - according to every interview he made) that, but for a car accident on his way to New York, he would have beat Elvis to The Ed Sullivan Show and would have been the king of rock. He may have some supporting evidence in this collection.Carl's sound is so pure, you think he invented it. Not only does Blue Suede Shoes sound like he's actually making that statement (""Don't you step...""), but I wouldn't want to step on them with him in them.My favorite track is ""Glad All Over"" - no, not the Dave Clark 5 song (although I really like that one too). The only thing better than hearing this track is seeing Carl perform it, which you can in the movie ""Jamboree"" - available through amazon on VHS.If you like the sound of the roots of rock-a-billy as it was produced in the Sun studios, you'll love this collection. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I wanted a lot of photos with it. But, then again, I'm like that :-)"
2,"Love Ashley Judd, just not this movie","I think Ashley Judd is an incredibly talented actress and usually will watch movies just because she is in them. But this was a really bad movie as far as story lines goes. I came away from this movie feeling very little, mostly that I wasted 2 hours watching. No inspiration, no thoughtful moments not even a just plan good entertainment. I hate to say it, but skip this movie."
5,An amazing little movie,"Come Early Morning is a great movie, with a brilliant performance by Ashley Judd, the most underrated actress today. The movie is hard and rough but also really very tender. It's about breaking through and watching as someones life falls apart and seeing how beautiful that can be. Beauty in the breakdown."
1,What was she thinking?,"I recently watched this movie for one reason.. Jeffrey Donovan. I'm a recent fan because of Burn Notice on USA Network. He was very good in this movie, very real and touching. Although Ashly Judd is a beautiful and extremely talented actress, this movie was a complete waste of time. There were many lost opportunities for the story to take a better turn, such as the dog. Why not then, after the dog died, get another dog and show that she has some feelings for something afterall. The end is just horrible and I'm left with... is that all there is? Did she really change? Is she going to go back to her old ways? Will she be able to keep the company afloat? Did she make amends with her father? What about her grandparent?Too may questions left unanswered."
3,Ashley Judd and Jeffrey Donovan deliver good performances..,"[personal note: I missed this indie movie when it first was released. As is the case with many good movies, they get lost among the high budget ""blockbuster"" type movies that get all the press and media coverage]. Stacy Keach and Laura Prepon also star and are great in this film.Ashley Judd plays Lucy, a blue collar 30-something woman living in small town Arkansas. Lucy is falling into a pattern of love-less one night stands and alcohol binges. She is also trying to maintain family relationships without going crazy; with an emotionally distant father and high maintainence mother to contend with. Her roommate, while trying to be helpful, criticizes her choices in men.She finally meets a new guy at the local bar, hoping this time things will be different. This time maybe she can be intimate with someone without being drunk. Will she finally find a loving, supportive relationship, and stop drinking? You'll have to watch the movie....."
1,YUCK!,"Good grief! What a complete waste of two hours! Filthy language, trashy people. A bunch of losers go...absolutely NOWHERE!That pretty much sums up the whole movie. If they took all the money they spent on booze and one-night-stand hotels and paid for counseling, they might eventually learn that doing exactly the same dysfunctional thing over and over is never going to change their lives for the better.Depressing. I just hope that all that beer has birth control in it. No right to inflict such misery on children."
3,was okay,I enjoyed the movie alright .. had an okay story line .. but of course this doesn't have in-depth charactors .. and so .. its pretty fair to watch one time but normally would have rated it and routed it on .. but the reason I actually bought this movie ... is because my husbands sister is in one of the bar scenes .. and so I had to buy it for him ...
1,This movie stinks,"I can't understand anyone giving this movie anything but one star. It stinks. It's a tired and overdone plot with a main character who is very hard to care about. I wanted more of the stray dog story. At least that would have given us more to watch. Even Judd's roommate made a more interesting study. The Lucy/Judd character is just plain boring. She drinks. We get it. Coors light. We get it. Please buy it. She poses and plays pool and gets drunk every night. We get it. She drives too fast and she wears the same clothes every day. We get it. She sleeps around with strangers. We get it. She NEVER combs her freakin' hair. We DON'T get it. She is a most unhappy and unlikeable girl. We got it. I won't get the movie, however. I am actually glad I had a free rental here.Save your dimes and rent Kiss the Girls. At least that was interesting and you cared about Judd's character. And she combed her hair at least once. Sigh"
2,Still Disapointing,"I did not want a slayers clone I wanted ORPHEN edgey, somewhat dark, great artwork and music and characters I liked. Not whining undisciplined children.Question: if you woke up three moring in a row with a women in your bed that was not there when you went to bed. Might you be asking what was going on?Cleo is an experanced traveler. She would not buy every piece of tourist junk offered. Dresses maybe, food certainly, but stautes? She is walking and it weights a ton.The burmese chicken, 10 ft of breast meat, is funny. Lycous attempts to give it a bath calls for lots of luck. Espceially when you leave the door open.Volken and Dorkin: Orphen might lend money to Dorkin. Never to the idiot Volken whose greatest joy is attempting to kill him.If you must have it wait for the box set used."
4,"Also available on Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 3","I second all the positive reviews and would like to add that for a few dollars more you can get this movie as part ofFilm Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 3 (Border Incident / His Kind of Woman / Lady in the Lake / On Dangerous Ground / The Racket)-- well maybe more than a just a few dollars more, but you will get some other worthy films including another Mitchum vehicle.You even get the commentary plus a bonus disk with other special features only available on the collection."
3,OK,"Last 45 minutes is good, but the movie is slow at times. You don't really realize it is a spoof of sorts until pretty far in."
3,John Farrow vs. Howard Hughes.,"I loved the first two-thirds of this movie - great dialogue, interesting characters and a promising storyline. That is the portion directed by John Farrow. The last third of the film becomes a boring mess just as the action steps up. This is due to producer Howard Hughes take-over of the project at that point. He decided to reshoot a large part of the film resulting in an abrupt change in tone and direction toward the absurd and the illogical. Artistically Hughes' peculiar tastes and his ""hands-on"" approach didn't serve him well in his movie-making career. His contribution to this film spoiled a potential noir masterpiece and made it way too long."
4,Class Book,"I bought this book for a class I am attending, and I have found it very useful. I am a graduate student, and I think it will make an excellent contribution to my thesis."
3,These are OK but no blade lock,"These breakaway knives are a good deal.They are sharp, but they do not havea blade lock so be careful."
4,Good book on church history,"Mr. Langford's book is a good, although much condensed, history of the Christian church. It has been used as a Sunday school text for junior high school age children. Although it is written in a simpler style to make it suitable for this age group, it is still readable for adults interested in an introduction to how the church developed. The copyright date is in the 1950's, before the changes made by the more recent ecumenical movements."
5,Worked Great on a squirrel,"Last winter a pathetic hairless squirrel started visiting our backyard. The poor mangy thing was covered with sores and obviously near death. In desperation I bought a bottle of Ivermectin from Amazon. One drop from a baby syringe on half a walnut, and he gobbled it right up -- with no apparent notice of the taste. The first signs of improvement took about a week. After four treatments at 10 day intervals he was a new squirrel! Today he is completely normal in appearance, covered with a thick healthy coat of fur with a big bushy tail. Simply amazing."
3,Worked great but long wait,"Medicine healed my guinea pig after 3 treatments. He looks and feels great now! However, it took almost 2 weeks to receive it...that's a long wait when your animal is sick!"
5,Treatment for Guinea Pigs,After finding out my guinea pigs had mange mites I researched they're condition and found out about Ivermectin. After reading numerous reviews I used it as directed putting a drop behind each ear and once a week for about 2 or three weeks. I noticed my guinea pigs began to itch less and they're fur began to grow back where patches were missing..overall the medicine worked well and did the job. I would still say take your guinea pigs to a vet or a humane society that deals with small animals to be examined if u don't have money for a vet.
1,DURVET IVERMECTIN,This item is a waste of money!! My dog still scratches and it smells horrible and leaves the smell on there fur and also stains it if they are light color!!! WASTE OF MONEY!!
2,As per label...Not up to scratch for humans,"This product, to be fair, is said not to be for human use, but as far as I know good quality ivermectin may be used internally or externally on animals and humans...usually get my supplies for my humans from vets...cheaper...thought I'd try this for scabies varians canis in a human...no dice...so follow label advice ...no humans for this product...or at least not where there is a possibility of multi-drug resistance as in this case.Cheerio"
4,EXCELLENT READ! I'VE NEVER READ ANYTHING LIKE THIS!,"Thanks to Amazon.com reviewers, I picked this book up and was instantly swept away in the story.You don't have to be a bodybuilder to get into this greatly told tragic story about taking your body to its limit.This author takes all the fat out and tells it like it is. (no pun intended)The authors streamlined writing takes center stage and lets you inside a bizzarre world of muscles, enhancing drugs, and redemption.The ending was just the bomb! This is a must for anyone who just wants to take a walk on the wild side..."
4,"Good book, average author","Welcome to the world of bodybuilding. It has a great storyline about the destruction of a woman dominated by a man. He pumps her with winstrol to make her a champ. Her clit enlarges and her hormones increase. Men's musculature flare on her shoulders and chest, sticking out her implants. She's forced to the edge of sex, scandal and drugs.The author's writing is good, but not great. The story and insider info make this worth reading. And it's been optioned for a movie."
5,Intreguing and Insightful,"In Chemical Pink, Katie Arnoldi explores and exposes a dark and unkown side of women's bodybuilding. Its an erotic tale of obsession and sacrifice. It illustrates what many female bodybuilders need to go through and what they sacrifice to be successful. It is an enjoyable book and I didn't put it down. Sex, drugs, and muscles. The characters were well established. This book was entertaining, disturbing, and comical at times. I enjoyed every minute of it."
3,A good fast read,"I thought this book would be appalling and that I would have to challenge myself to get through it. This belief was based on reviews I had read about it. Perhaps I have a high shock threshold, and therefore, the book was interesting but not entirely disturbing. The references to sex are mild and not thoroughly played out. Actually the most disturbing part is the excessive use of drugs and steriods that are referenced throughout the story. I read it all in one day and found it went quickly, but it left me wanting more from the characters. I think this is a good first work."
4,GREAT IF YOU'RE INTO IT,"I'm into bodybuilding so this book was a great read for me. There is so much information about the drugs behind the sport that I had a hard time putting it down.If you're not into the world of bodybuilding however, there is a decent story there for you. The book is written with a style that is fun and very quick to read.I wish that it had ended with one more chapter, but other than that, I say that Katie Arnoldi did a good job on her first novel and am looking forward to the next."
2,Lacking,"...I noticed something very early in this book, which made me consider continuing at all. One rule in writing is ""show, don't tell"", and this seems to be forgotten at times here. It irritates me. This could be so much more..."
3,a guilty pleasure diversion,"like many others, i was sucked into buying this book based on my palahniuk.fetish..it wasn't a horrid experience..the writing is crisp. the plot moves. it's entertaining..when i finished, i felt as though the novel was forced. not as in arnoldi didn't have the material, but lacked the time to flesh out her creations the way she could have..i later read that this was based upon a short.story. this may be a figment of my own imagination, but it would explain the feeling that i took away from the book..i'd still recommend this as a quick.n.dirty read that will give you at least one little gasp of surprise."
4,"gritty and raw, worth the read!!","This book was great, page turner!!! I'm in the bodybuilding world and this wasn't far from what I've heard of some women's needs and wants to rise to the top!!! Gritty, raw, sexual, and just fun to read....easy reading for cardio!!"
4,What happened?,"This book was an extremely quick read. I don't know if that was because the book is relatively short or because it is so captivating, but probably more of the latter. This book may not be as funny as Fight Club, but it's pretty close. The relationhips between characters are so perverse. The emotional damage these people wreak on each other is priceless. I don't think I'll ever be able to watch the female bodybuilders at the gym or on television the same way."
3,"Hmmm...very, very interesting","Okay, so I will admit that the reason I picked this book up is because I thought the cover picture was a naked man with really big pecs!!! Obviously it wasn't, but after reading about the plot I decided to give it a try.I have to say that I can't even figure out if I liked the book or not. It kept my interest, and I read it in one sitting, but I didn't finish it and think, ""Wow, that's a keeper!""So, every other reviewer has gone over the plot, and I must say that it was an odd plot. I had never really thought about women body builders and the life that they lead. If this book is an honest example of the life they lead then it makes me wonder why anyone would do it?I did notice in the other reviews that people talk about the graphic, kinky sex in the book. The acts are definitely pretty kinky, but the author doesn't go into too much detail.Overall, I don't know if I would really recommend it, or read it again, but I don't feel that I wasted time in reading it."
2,fast read,"Just a lightweight kind of read. All the information is there, there's a bit of a story, but not much to it. Ends kind of abruptly. There is some world-class degeneracy described, but somehow it just seems crammed in with the rest of it, like, gee, I need to use this bit."
2,Chemical Pink - Embarrasing,"This book was like a car wreck on the highway wreck. No matter how messy, disgusting, or annoying Ms. Arnoldi gets, you're compelled to keep reading to see if she'll stoop further. She often does. The characters seem like they were from a B-movie, one dimensional, corny dialogue, and unbelievable situations. While she may have set out to create an original novel showing people's obsessions, what she made is just a silly novel."
1,weird and uninteresting,I couldn't figure out whether to be disturbed with the writing or with the fact that I convinced myself to buy it and read it.
1,Very boring and confusing,"This DVD really isn't what we were looking for. We wanted a DVD we could follow in a real time - like a class.The instructions are not very clear. The routine is very SLOW and BORING. The whole hour only one of the partners does the exercises and the other one only supports him/her. That was the most upsetting thing. You need to do the whole routine again and switch then.Maybe it's because this DVD is a basic level, but we definitely won't try if the other levels are better. We followed this DVD just once and won't do again. The only good thing is that the DVD was quite cheap, so we didn't waste much money."
5,Grace Seanson 2 takes the good and makes it better,"Everything works in this series: brave writing, distinctive camera work, atmospheric sound track and great performances from everyone.There is no sugar-coating of redemption here. Instead we have real pain, real struggle and tremendous humanity. Wonderful stuff"
5,Being from Shawnee...,"we got more than just woods...we are becoming quite the little Boom-Town. But, I love this show, I will be ordering this season(2) on DVD like I have with the first season. Does anybody know when we can expect new episodes? Because, I want to see Grace start to make subtle changes to come closer to God, Ham, and just maybe her family!! ;)"
4,Pulling for Earl,"Definitely an adult cop show, Grace is not the girl next door. I find she is hard to look at unless you like anorexia. Holly Hunter is a good actor, cast is a good mix and likeable. Like the storyline of saving Grace. I'm pulling for Earl !"
5,The best Series on Television,An excellent series that was so well done it will always leave you wanting more. Highly recommend this to anyone over 15.
4,Saving Grace season 2,The show Saving Grace is one of the best shows ever. The DVD was exellent except for one thing. The last one or two episodes were not on the DVD.I plan on buying season three when it is released and I hope these episodes will be included in that installment. I'm really sorry to see this series end so soon and so suddenly.
5,Excellent TV program,"Saving Grace: Season Two continues the story of Grace and her search for meaning with her angel, Earl, as a guide. Writing for this show is thoughtful and innovative. Possibly the most well-rounded female character since Tyne Daly on ""Cagney and Lacey."""
2,LACKLUSTER LIVE,"Very disappointed in this cd. For a ""live"" performance, the band didn't sound as energized as usual. Some good tracks, tho."
2,Poor recording,"The dowload dose not sound as good as the samples! It's a sound I guess you should expect when recorded in an auditorium. I don't know how to describe it, but it is not the full sound you normally get. It's like there should be an echo, and the volume goes up and down in some sounds. A very inconsistnet set of recordings."
5,The Mavericks Live In Austin Texas,The Mavericks Live In Austin DVD is an absolute winner. I tried to find it locally but ended up coming to Amazon. The music is fantastic as are the Mavericks.
3,Are The Mavericks still performing?,"That's was my 21 year old son's reaction to this CD. Although I've been a fan since there first release, my son had very little interest until he heard ""Volver volver."" That led to ""All you ever do is bring me down."" Which led to wanting to hear all my old tapes(yes, I still have tapes)CDs and Raul's solo stuff. ""I said I love you"" is his favorite and we'd like to see them ""Live in California."""
5,This vacuum does a really good job.,"The marketing people did a nice job naming this vacuum, because the name fits. It really is powerful and it seems to just glide across the floor on both carpet and hard surfaces. I can't believe how good of a vacuum I got for such a reasonable price. I would have expected to pay a lot more for a vacuum that does this good of a job."
4,Best in Class,"For sure, the best vacuum at this price point. The only reason I rated it a four is that, because the cord storage is on the side of the machine, it is necessary to unwind the cord before removing the hose tool (I'm not sure why this bothers me, but it does).Great filtration, easy to push and PICKS UP DOG HAIR ON THE FIRST PASS!"
2,It doesn't hold up for 4 years,"When I first purchased this vacuum, it was wonderful! It had great suction, was lightweight and very quiet. Attachments were easy to use.Our first obstacle happened when we couldn't find the right size bags in many stores. We couldn't even find them at Best Buy where we had purchased the vacuum in the first place! Then we needed to replace a belt, and had a hard time finding the one to fit as well.Now, after 4 years, the only time we get a decent vacuum from it is immediately after we change the bag. It just doesn't have good suction anymore."
5,"EXCITEMENT, INTRIGUE, SUSPENSE, ADVENTURE","SUMMON THE SHADOWS is a 'must read' and an exciting follow-up to SHADOW OF DREAMS. Everson and Chadwick have woven through this expertly written novel a believeable story of mystery and faith. I was unable to put it down and when completing it, counting the days for book number 3 to be released. Katies friendships, care and compassion for her friends while she struggles with her own heartbreaking circumstances shows how faith can keep one moving forward and is heartwarming. The characters are very real and I found myself involved with the daily comings and goings of each of them as the plot thickened. A great story which keeps one wondering what the outcome will be."
4,Where's Ben,"Summon the Shadows moves into the corporate world of Hotel management with the surprising ability of Katie to take over where her husband left off and grow the business even bigger in spite of all the people who are conspiring against her. The writing is fast paced and the mystery deepens, but I must admit I was disappointed to be left hanging again.... Where's Ben? I trust there will be a sequel that will bring closure to this question."
4,Summon the Shadows,Another winner by Everson and Chadwick. The plot kept me guessing all the way to the end and the characters have become my friends. I need to know what is going to happen next! (Anymore books in this series?)I highly recommend SUMMON THE SHADOWS. It doesn't matter what kind of books you enjoy..this one is a guaranteed thoroughly enjoyable read.
4,Memorable and pleasant fantasy for young readers.,"This was one of the earliest fantasy books that I read as a child, and it made a vivid impression on me.Jay and Jess are very different boys who just cannot seem to get along. When they find themselves in another world after a fistfight in the hall, they need to find a way to become friends. The land of Gwyliath is a mixture of familiar mythology landscapes with just a dash of Oz thrown in. There is a very nice sense of surrealism to the characters which keeps it from being a stock exercise.While not as enduring as other YA fantasy books, Hero From Otherwhere has some nice messages and interesting passages. I would still recommend the Lloyd Alexander and Susan Cooper books over this one, but it might be just the ticket for a slightly younger reader."
5,If you loved Harry Potter,"If you loved Harry Potter and if your kids love Harry Potter, than this is the book for you. It is like a Mark Twain novel - you should read it more than once in your life time. The story is full of magic and mystery and this reader feels would make a great family film. Wake-up Hollywood!"
5,An outstanding children's story with magic & fantasy,"This book was one of my favorite stories when I was growing up. I was always a big fan of C.S. Lewis' ""Chronicles of Narnia"" but there were only seven of them so occasionally I was forced to read something else. One day while on vacation I came across ""The Hero from Otherwhere,"" and I was delighted to find such a story. It is a tale of two boys, one athletic, the other intellectual, who do not get along, but find themselves pulled into another world, similar to our own, but slightly skewed. There they are given several tasks and learn to rely on each other along the way. It is a marvelous story of friendship and teaches valuable lessons about each person's unique talents. I'm sorry to say that this book is currently out of print. I have been searching for a copy for about seven years. Hopefully, I will find one soon, or it will be re-released because it hurts me that my children may grow up without this book."
5,"Superb adventure story, please no movie","This is a magical book about two boys who could not be more different if they tried. They are flung into a wild adventure together and must discover how to work together to survive. This is a tale with implications much larger than excitement for early readers. Williams strength is his imagination and his ability to call on archetypal imagery.I hope that there is never a movie made of this story, though I do hope the book is reprinted by some insightful publisher. The power in this book is in the imagination, which, no matter how good a movie might be, or how closely it might follow the book, a movie would ruin the imaginative pictures created by the reader."
2,Bought to receive free shipping,"I don't really like these clips. I really bought them to receive the free shipping offer, but I decided to try to use them to wrangle the cords on my computer. I found them awkward to use...preferring to use twist-ties instead."
2,Akward and bulky,"I got these to help keep the cord on my iron in order. While they work OK, they are really bulky and require that you get just the right amount of cord wrapped into them or they will not close. Not enough cord, and it will just slide out. Without an adjustment ability like that of a velcro/hook-and-loop strap or a zip-tie, they just are not that useful.The one place they might work is if you permanently attach them to a wall, allowing you to route cords around doors or out of the way on a temporary basis, because you can open the clip and remove the cord when done."
5,JUMPIN JESUS ON A POGO STICK,"this is great. go buy it. great to listen to over and over. worth 20 bucks, though i only paid 13, any way, Stuart is my favorite song. It's great to see that a local band made it this big. check out Atom and his package too. another local band"
4,man i whish i still had this album,"i just gotta say the line ""how do you market a punk band that sings about drinking bleach"". could be the best way to sum of the milkmen. I think this album is a bit more tounge in cheek than big lizard (if that's possible). references to domestic violence and gay martians. man i need to buy this album"
4,Like an an old friend,"This album never fails to make me smile, and has done so for the past 12 years. Also a great album, although not as consistent in my opinion, is Metaphysical Graffiti. Very creative minds..."
2,Don't bother,"Okay, first off I really enjoyed it, but there's a major flaw, these volumes (1-4) only have 5 episodes each and there seems to be no plans on releasing more so going with these volumes you'll only make it to episode 20 out of a total of 50 episodes. If you really want to watch this series you should go with the increadibly expensiveBlood +: Part One with Bonus DiscandBlood +: Part Two, however that (at the time I'm writing this) is extremely expensive, approx $250 for USED and $400 for NEW.So if you don't mind not finishing the story that at episode 20 is still building up, I encourage you to get this, but if you like to see things through to the end (like me) you're better off without it."
3,Good for price,"Not bad for the price if you're looking to do some easy spinning over the winter. If you're looking to train hard, this is not for you. Also, if you have knobby tires, it will be very loud. The noise is not bad with slick tires."
2,Doesn't Fit,This was fairly easy to put together unfortunately it doesn't fit my bike. I have a Giant Avail 1 and I can not get my bike on the trainer securely. I thought I had it and after about 10min of use it came loose and I was leaning way off to one side. I'm sure if it fits your bike it works great but unfortunately is useless for me.
1,my outback,"I use my trainer every day, I like it alot. It has three tensions I use all three, plus I use all my gears on my bike.It's a little louder then I was expecting."
5,excerise,Bought as a birthday gift for college student. they love it especially when the weather is bad and can't get outside
3,Not Bad,"For the price this wasn't bad.I experienced a few minor frustrations. The assembly pictures weren't really clear, but putting it together was fairly self explanatory so I could live despite that.The only real issue came when I went to mount my bike. I have a Mongoose Mountain bike, and this is most definitely set up for a street bike.if you don't have a quick release latch on your rear tire you may need to purchase one. the one that is supplied is extremely small if you have a mountain bike (Mine requires almost a 1/4 inch shaft the one supplied is considerably less than that)However I was able to improvise by tightening the bracket on to my lugs and it works fine.Is rather loud, but I attribute that to my knobby tired more-so than the unit itself, which when I tested it was very quietAll said and told a good purchase, just wish they had supplied more information (such as the latch) before purchasing so i could have been better prepared."
5,So far so Good,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He was thrilled when the box was delivered in it's self packaging so Christmas blown, but he has been happy with it since. He gets his ride in no matter what the weather or time of day."
5,Great Exercise Stand,"Product is very solid and steady. Easy to set up and works very well. It's not that loud in use and turning on some music in the background or watching a favorite show on TV while working off some pounds is a simple solution to shutting out the whirring noise. Magnetic adjustment is easy to set, but next time I might spend a little more and get one that allows the tension to be adjusted while you're on the bike pedaling."
5,"Put Yourself in their Shoes (err, paws)","Ever wonder what it is like to be a canine ? Ever wonder, 'What is it really thinking?' This book is in my opinion a great rendering of how it is to be a fox or a hound. Warning: this is not a sentimental, gushy account. It is a 'realistic' portrayal of life, as experienced by the chief protaganists."
2,Miserable,"What a wretched experience! It is a somewhat facinating, well written book, don't get me wrong, but the story was depressing and the plot was pointless! Nobody learned anything. I got to read of the slaughter of fox after fox after fox, all for some man's twisted sense of revenge that makes no logical sense at all. I can't figure what message we are supposed to take from this story. I guess there's an anti-human thing going, the idea that animals just do what they do, it's the humans that mess everything up.I think other books spread that message more effectively. This was just agony to read. I kept waiting for a glimmer of hope and none was forthcoming. Despite some claims, this is not a children's book. It is nothing like the Disney movie, and if they can slog through the sometimes heavy language, they will find no happy ending or singing owls here."
2,Adequate Card,"I would not recommend this card for use as your primary TV and/or even for recording video. Even with my Intel Core2 Extreme and 8GB of 800MHz RAM, this card produces choppy video. It may not be annoying to some, but it is to me. I would recommend getting an external USB device for a TV tuner."
4,"Great picture quality, crappy software","Fantastic resolution in the DVD-high-quality mode, and the onboard-processor frees up your CPU to do other things, like surf the web, while you're recording shows. The included software is junk -- I get jittery video on occasion and sometimes no sound with their software. I'd recommend using it with Windows Media Center, or Beyond TV 4.0 software if you don't own Media Center. I plan to buy another card so I can record two shows at once."
5,Compared to ATI... WOW!,"I gave up after having an ATI product for about 1 week, and seeing all the negative reviews for their product, abandoned ship and went for the Hauppauge WinTV-PVR-250 (Model 980). Flawless install, flawless operation. The software is much better than ATI's MMC software, but I've had a TIVO for the last five years and the Hauppauge interface was clunky in comparison. So I checked out SnapStream's Beyond TV and am very impressed. Surpasses the elegance of TIVO. I had the DirectTV TIVO and have now cancelled that subscription because, just using the PVR to catch broadcast signals provides me with enough news and entertainment to basically have a customizable 24 hour network. Moreover, I can watch / stream and transfer te standard MPEG files over a network. Simply amazing. I gave the ATI TV Wonder USB 2.0 a 2/5 stars. The WinTV-PVR-250 gets 5/5. To get the full experience, you should get Beyond TV (google it, there's a free trial available from the developer site.)"
4,Linux is now supported!,I am about to purchase this device now that it's supported under linux. Feel free to check out the MythTV web site for more information.
5,Simple to Install; Terrific Product,"If you don't get sweaty palms opening up your PC and plugging in a new card, fear not. This was one of the easiest, most problem-free add-ons I've ever installed.Just follow the very simple instructions in the booklet (3 steps, really).I have a fairly recent Dell (Pentium 4).What you do is open your PC, plug the card into an available slot, close the PC, connect the cable TV cord to the back, install the driver from the CD that was provided, install the software. Done.The entire job took about 15 minutes.This installation was, quite simply, effortless.The tuner has a remarkably clear, vibrant picture. The controls are very intuitive (you don't need to read the booklet), and it records exceptional quality MPEGs.I could not be more pleased with this product."
5,Great Card - No Questions About It!!,I have been doing a lot of research of what to buy and what not to buy and came across HAUPPAUGE. I started to look up there cards and their customer reviews (which are much better than ATI's). So I started looking for the card. Which apparently is not very easy. I wanted a good price!! So just before I bought it from Amazon which has the best brice I went to Micro Center and I got an awesome deal. Only because it was on the clearance reack b/c someone had trouble installing it. Just a word to all those wanna be computer people please don't. These cards are can be very difficult to install. IT took me an hour to get everthing working awesome. But the ones who talk bad about this card is probably thinking its going to be easy. ITS NOT!! Installing hardware or software can be tricky. Don't always assume its just going to magically install itself and start to work.
1,Avoid this one with XP at least,"After spending 2 days of trying fixes from their ""support"" site that you have to hunt and hunt to find anything, I find this system useless. I have a new XP system and you have to search around all locations on the Hauppage website to find new drivers. After trying about 30 combinations and reboots I did get video and audio however it was very jerky. I suggest trying an ATI card which actually works."
2,technical support (where are they?),"I have emailed the technical support 2 times and have yet to receive any reply on the following problem.After editing the commericals from a show that I had downloaded from tv, I burnded my DVD and foun that after each commerical I removed the audio/video would get more out of sync. By the end of the show, which was about 45 minutes in length, the audio/video was so far out of sync it was useless to watch."
1,Does not worth the money,"WinTV-PVR-250 has the folling problems:1. Remote control has design defect. You can not switch to full screen using remote control. Only several buttons work - more than half of the buttons on remote control do not work. The remote control is not sensitive - you need wait 2 second to switch the channel.2. No closed caption support.3. Very hard to install - you have to search the web and find the driver for you windows xp MCE.In a word, It does not worth the money."
4,Futuristic Industrial Metal done very well,"This is an intense Industrial Metal album that is somewhat comparable to Fear Factory's ""Soul of a New Machine"". The vocals are basically done in three different forms: low-pitch scream, dark melodic singing, and occasionally a high-pitch scream as heard on one of the album's better tracks ""Lost"", which goes from dark and brooding to hateful and grinding in seconds. There is alot of samples and sound effects added to the heaviness of the music and results of this mixture are very interesting. The band uses a drum machine, but they definitely make the most out of it, as the drums fit the music nicely. This is a great industrial metal album that fans of Meshuggah, FF, Pitchshifter, and Strapping Young Lad should not be without!"
5,A Versatile Model for Relationship Success,"WDYWWIW was recommended to me along with Paradigms (Barker) and Mindfulness (Langer). Together, the ideas presented in the three complement each other very well. But even taken alone, Maurer's model is versatile, useful, and easy to learn, if impossible to master. I've seen a few individuals, each of whom is very successful in different ways, in my estimation, who naturally execute the ideas Maurer proposes.The idea of using the three-tiered levels of understanding, enthusiasm, and trust for relationships is a secondary theme of the book, which focuses more on business transactions, but for just about anyone who 1) lives in Western society and 2) cares about improving his ability to communicate, whether selling ideas or just sharing information, this book provides a usable and useful model for transactional analysis. Two weeks after finishing the book, I'm finding it helpful in helping communicate ideas at work, school, and in my relationships."
3,It is OK,"The book makes some good points and does help guide you in doing better in this area. The reading is a little dry. I got bored and put the book down several times. This is a complete opposite to another book I recently read. ""Customer Satisfaction is Worthless. Customer Loyalty is Priceless."" I could not put the book down.My 2 cents worth."
2,Unhappy,"I give 1 star for prompt shipping, and 1 star for the product. But, when I ordered 2 packages, I really expect to get 2 PACKAGES. What I got was 2 wadded up handfuls of loose bags with rubber bands around them, stuffed unwrapped in a mailer!!! How sanitary is that for food bags? I won't be a repeat customer."
2,I wish that I would have read other reviews first,"I thought that there would be ties for the bread bags, and I didn't like how it was shipped. As other person stated, bags were rolled up with a rubber band around them. No packaging. I am really disappointed in these."
4,Much Better than Reviews Below...,"Almost did not order these based on the packaging mentioned by the orders below. The company must have heeded your complaints, though, because when I received them they were each packaged in their own, tied off bread bag. They seem very sanitary and are a very good size for the loaves I bake.So why 4/5 then?Make sure you order in bulk, because the S&H; on the order is a little pricey (doubles the cost for a single order) and does not honor Amazon's Prime rate. I ordered enough to last me a couple years and the price was very reasonable."
3,Bread Bags,The bread bags were fine and just what I was looking for but they do not come with ties so there is no way to keep them closed. It kind of defeats the purpose.
1,And the shipping is.....,"Like the others said, this is really poor service when there are no tie's included with the bags. ALSO, the shipping about gave me heart failure; as the shipping was over $8.00. The only way that this would be a worthwhile investments is if there were ties included and that you placed ""several"" orders of bags, so not to be paying more for shipping.I too am VERY disappointed."
4,Baker's Bags,"This item just arrived on Wednesday, April 15, 2009. The bread mix I ordered arrived the very next day, April 16, 2009, and was immediately baked. The bags feel a bit flimsy but I will reserve an immediate judgment until I finish putting the first bag, with the first loaf of bread, through its paces to see how well it performs. One caveat, these bags do NOT come with bread ties so you'll have to find other ways to close the bags."
1,Alternate bags,"I never brought this item, but I suggest going to a grocery store that bake bread and get bags from them. Sometimes you can get them for free. I go to Whole foods and they have no problem in giving me bags. Or I put in the those huge zip lock bag for the freezer and that works. Since I freeze my bread anyways. Sometimes I have little trash bags that I use or I use the bags at the grocery store and take a lot of the green ties too. I was just make some suggestions, because I was going to get this item but the reviews doesn't seem good."
3,Bread loaf bags pack of 50,"Disappointed, they sent 50 bread bags which are large and can accomodate any size loaf, however there were no ties or clips....so have to go searching for ties when I bake bread....bummer..........Can do just as well with 2 gallon bags from the dollar stores, and they will seal........."
4,Excellent Product,"These are very nice quality bags and they work extremely well for all the loaf sizes and pans we have at the house. The only reason for 4 stars is it would be nice if they included 50 twist ties with the bags, especially since the bag in the photo is tied; but they did not, and now we are scrounging around to collect the ties from other bags when we need them. Excellent bag (Quality, Size - 5 Stars), incomplete product (No Ties - 4 Stars)."
5,Egypt,Just got back from Egypt where on the cruise down the Nile we saw a part of this program. It was soo good that we purchased it once home. My review: the BBC programs which make up this disc were better than the actual trip!!
2,Beware - 60 minutes cut from U.K. version,"I have not seen this yet. It gets excellent reviews on Amazon.co.uk.I will be buying it from Amazon.co.uk. The U.K. version is described there as lasting 360 minutes. The U.S. version is described here as lasting 300 minutes.American studios do this kind of thing to DVDs quite often. See, e.g., ""Vietnam, A Television History,"" in which two out of the thirteen original PBS episodes were quietly excluded from the DVD, and other episodes were edited down from the originals. The studios often fill up the saved time on the DVDs with advertisements. It tells us a lot about what the studios think about their U.S. viewers.As you probably know, you will need a mutli-region DVD player to watch a DVD purchased from the U.K."
2,Wrong,Product seems OK but they didn't fit truck as advertised. I drilled them out and adapted but not sure it will work properly.
4,"Great story, One to read again!","When I first discovered ""Growing Wings"" while working at a B. Dalton bookstore in Iowa, who would know that a few years later I would meet and befriend the Laurel Winter herself? Its a terrific book which begs to be made into a movie! The author took an imaginative approach by making it clear that flying wasn't an easy feat to accomplish, but with enough help (and helium!) she gives us hope that we all might fly."
4,Good Book,"Growing Wings is about an 11 year old girl that starts growing her own wings.Her mother doesn't know what to do with her so she just leaves her in a motel.Eventually she ends up at a sanctuary for people with wings.This book is an intresting and fun read.The main character is a bit overdramatic,for instance, her attitude is ""Oh whatever shall I do"".I would reccomend this book to any one who likes fantasy books.I personally think that growing wings would be cool.I think the main character is overreacting and even though some people might be freaked out by the mings most will find them beautiful."
4,In the background,the cds from this series are good at like shops or eateries. They'ld be great if shorter.
5,Title Says It All,"I'm the number one fan of the Spinners.NO vocal group in history has combined the church and the street better.All the new material here is quite good.Was very leery at the get-go about a ""updated"" version of I'll Be Around.I mean,why mess with perfection,right? The new one with Kool Moe Dee rappin'is just flat bad.I scored this CD 3 weeks ago and haven't taken it out of the player as yet.Well worth the money."
1,I paid two months ago and have not yet sent me,I paid two months ago and have not yet sent mepagué el cd hace 2 meses y no me lo han enviado
4,The Spinners At Their Best...Quite An Underestimation,"I purchased this CD a year after it was released and I haven't regretted. It's not because I'm a huge Spinners fan, but because I love quality music, and the Spinners rarely seem to disappoint. I respect the spin they put on Stevie Wonder's ""Do I Do"" hit by having him only play harmonica and it was a weird twist having esteemed rapper Yo-Yo on the hit. I was kind of thrown off as to why they remade their own hit I'll Be Around addin' rapper Kool Moe Dee to the mix. The remake wasn't bad, but I just felt that if it ain't broke, don't fix it; nevertheless, this album does greatly and tremendously contribute to the testament of what the Spinners always maintained among themselves and what they've given us for the countless number if years since they've formed. You can't go wrong with ""Can't Help Lovin' You"" and ""That's Why I Love You"", which are the two love songs on this album that grabbed me the most. R.I.P. Billy Henderson"
3,Could have been better.,"Anyone who knows me or have look at my reviews knows i am the spinners#1 fan but i gotta tell ya this cd was not what i hoped it would be.Firstthing to many remakes of other artist songs on this cd.The classic ill be around why mess with perfection? there should be a law.I do have some good news the two songs why me,can,t help loving you are worth the buy.So as always but in this case try to enjoy!"
5,sex pistols still rockin!,"This cd is cool and original, and that is exactly ehat the Sex Pistols are. I mean, who can release ONE album and still be the most famous punk band to hit The U.K.?"
4,Light and fun!,"As a die-hard Anita Blake fan, this was an interesting change of pace. It's like ""Anita-light."" I still prefer the Hamilton books, but this was an absolutely fun read, and I've just ordered the next one."
2,Could have been better.,"I read this book as a way to soothe my longing for a new Sookie Stackhouse novel. Oddly, I was a little put off by how derivative it was of a Sookie novel. Honestly, the main love interest is named Eric...strange. But generally I thought it was a way to meld vampire fiction with Gone With the Wind, which the author obviously likes since she references it in her book. The heroine is a 21st century Scarlett O'Hara and the Eric Sinclaire character is her Rhett Butler. Some of the jokes were a little lame and at the level of a middle schooler. There were times when I wished a character would stake her protagonist with the heel of one of her beloved Manolos. Also, as an African American her treatment of the two black characters was very bad. It's like she learned about black people by watching 70s sitcoms and blaxploitation films. Still, I applaud her for having black characters at all. Overall it's an okay book, but nothing I would regret not reading."
2,All Fluff,"I'll admit I expected not to like this book. I don't like flighty shallow heroines, and I'm very picky when it comes to comedy in books. I'm sorry to say this book didn't really prove me wrong.It's the first person account of Betsy becoming a vampire. Betsy seems dimwitted and self absorbed, but to give her credit she does have a good sense of humor. At first it was mildly amusing to read about her ""death"", and subsequent inability to truly die. That lasted about 50 pages. Then the evil stepmother showed up, having stolen Betsy's shoes after she ""died"" and I lost interest. Aside from the fact that the constant naming of brands (she goes on and on about the shoes!) was driving me crazy, I just couldn't deal with the simplistic characterization and melodrama.My impression of this book was that it's a lot like a soap opera, but with a vampire as our person of interest. To some this may be appealing, and if your looking for a mindless laugh I'd say go for it. Not for me, though."
2,I Had High Hopes...........,"but finished the book very disappointed. The concept is great, the story wasn't that bad, the writing was very juvenile and at times just wore me down. I would have loved this book when I was 14 or 15.I took the advice of another reviewer and bought Charlaine Harris book. Much better choice for me."
3,Be prepared for betrayal,This series books 1 thru 8 and they are a fun and entertaining read but be prepared that in book 9 the author completely betrays all the history of the characters that was built up in books 1 thru 9 but in the last 2 pages of book 9 the author violates everything you have come to know about the characters so enjoy but be prepared for the 8 books to become a waste of time after you finish book 9. They are fun but it is all ruined in the last pages of book 9
2,It had it's moments,"This was an okay read. I was wanting to get into a series, but this just didn't hit the spot. I found Liz annoying and her voice beyond annoying. I liked some of the story line, but not enough for me to move on to the second book."
4,FUN,This is not your typical brooding vampire book. Ok Sinclair may be a little dark and broody but the vampire queen most definitely is not. This book was alot of fun to read. I honestly love the direction Davidson went with this story. A vampire queen who loves to shop and is obsessed with shoes and other pretty things. Not to mention that the whole undead thing just seems to be a minor inconvenience for her. Normally not my style but I couldn't resist trying it and I'm honestly glad I did. As soon as I finished it I went right out and bought the next installment...Undead and Unemployed. Note: There are 4 stars instead of 5 because use of phrases beginning with stupid this or stupid that became ever so slightly annoying. Still worth taking the time to read if you're looking for a vampire novel on the lighter side.
5,Very Entertaining!,"This book was recommended to me & I am so glad I picked up a copy. I have not laughed so hard while reading a book ever. This is definitely not your average Vamp book. If you like the humor and sarcasm in Buffy and Angel, you will definitely adore this book, and it's heroine. I can't wait for the next book in the series."
2,Not as funny as other reviewers have stated,"After reading the reviews of ""Undead and Unwed"", I expected the book to be a funny mix of chick-lit and fantasy. While the book can accurately be called chick-supernatural, it failed in the humor department. Davidson, the author, tried too hard to be witty. The first three chapters have more exclamation points ""!"" than I have ever seen before in my life. (really!!)The main character, Betsy, was unlikable. It's like Davidson took Carrie from Sex in the City, dumbed her down and took away everything that makes her interesting--then made her a vampire called ""Betsy"".This book isn't worth the time or effort. Read Kelley Armstrong or Tanya Huff instead of this series. Save yourself!"
1,disappointed at best,"I love paranormal romances, as long as they are written well. If the novel has a good storyline, realistic characters, and problems that I can (at some level) commiserate about, then I am all there. I read Undead and Unwed and could not get into it. The pace of the book and the dialogue left a lot to be desired and I forced myself to finish the book. If you are looking for some great books... try the anita blake series (for werewolves, vampires, etc), the meredith gentry series (for fairies and all things fey), or J.D Robb's Eve Dallas series (a great mystery/cop thriller series)."
2,Undead and uncool,"The idea of this book was ""cute"", i.e., take a self-centered, vapid, vain chiclet and make her a vampire. No wait, make her an important vampire and juxtapose the two. I know, she'll be so vain she'll hate men but love expensive shoes! She'll even be a Republican! The cuteness just doesn't end. Neither does the annoyance, unfortunately.I applaud the attempt to create an original vampire character, making an ordinary, vain, imperfect human an immortal. When Davidson gets into action there is some spark and suspense. And there is also some humor when Betsy tries to continue to fit into her former life. But when a character is so stupidly self-centered and immature all in the name of ""cuteness"" -- and when there is not even a tiny acknowledgement that life might be a little different now -- then reading becomes an exercise in torture, and a minor diversion, like a toothache."
3,"a fun, self-indulgent light read","Undead and Unwed is snarky and shallow; but that's okay, because it's supposed to be.I read it really quickly and enjoyed it. Betsy is a lot of fun, and vampires apparently have a lot of hot sex.I didn't understand why Betsy was so angry at Sinclair the whole time; he really was very helpful from beginning to end. Betsy keeps accusing him of being sneaky and underhanded...but it's more that he has the same sort of undead charisma that she does (so it's no fair to throw stones), and that Betsy often doesn't listen when he tries to explain things.I'll probably read the next one."
4,A Fun Read IF You Can Take It For What It Is,This was obviously meant to be light hearted and funny. I laughed my head off at Betsy who refused to be like the other vampires with their drama and angst. I also enjoyed her being fashion conscious and berating the others for remaining in the past. All in all I found it hilarious and an enjoyable read. If you enjoy the darker vampire books then this is not for you.
4,A great read,This book is a truly funny in a way many paranormal based books today are not. It doesn't travel the gloomy gothic route but instead summons giggles with every page-turn as you travel along with the most unlikely of vampires.
3,Mindless Read,"The book is fun to read if you are in the mood to read something light and mindless, or reading for the sake of nothing better to do. It's not a bad book to read, its cover already tells you what to expect. No huge surprises, but definitely fun to pass time with."
4,Hilarious..........................,"I picked this book up by chance after reading several reviews,and I have to say this book was funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnny. Betsy Tyler a typical normal living human was laid off from her job, and having to rescue her cat Giselle gets hit by a car and is killed instantly,or is she. She wakes up in a coffin at a funeral home not sure of what happens to and from there the book is real laugh-fest. She is now a vampire, butthe funny thing is things are backwards in her vampire life, if I go into anymore of it the review would be to long, all I can say is read the book. You will definately enjoy it. I highly recommend it."
2,Like a bad sitcom...,"I liked the premise and there were some moments of amusement in this book. But overall it was just tedious and juvenile. I understand that it's supposed to be a parody of sorts, but so much of the dialog felt like a very bad sitcom to me... wooden and repetitive lines spouted by two-dimensional characters."
3,"Betsy Taylor is no Bridget Jones, but it's a fun romp anyway","""Undead and Unwed"" popped up as a recommended book for me from Amazon, probably because I buy a lot of vampire fiction--most recently ""Dead to the World"" by Charlaine Harris and ""Dead Witch Walking"" by Kim Harrison. It sounded like a fun book to read. I enjoyed ""Bridget Jones Diary"" and ""The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing"" and other chic-lit type books, so I thought I'd probably enjoy a chic-lit vampire book.""Undead and Unwed"" was fun, but it was a little more of a standard romance than I was bargaining for. Since Charlaine Harris only gets around to writing a book or two a year, it's probably worth reading if you're a big Sookie Stackhouse fan. If you haven't read them yet, I would recommend the Charlaine Harris' books as being more tightly written with better characterization. Christopher Moore's ""Bloodsucking Fiends"" is another favorite in the humorous, female vampire vein."
4,Undead and Unwed Review,"Absolutely hilarious. I loved it, and it was a break from the more serious vampire books, without any moral dilemmas or good vs. evil type stuff. Mostly just very funny. You'll laugh out loud (and then people will stare at you.)"
4,"Witty, Adorable, Quick Read","Whats worse then waking up after getting hit by a car and thinking you are dead? Finding out that your evil stepmonster had buried you in polyester and cheap shoes and has taken all your expensive shoes, of course.That really gives you the gist of this laugh-out-loud book. I read much of this book while commuting, and got a lot of stares.Minor complaints could be an ending that seems overly sexually explicit, given the rest of the book, and a confrontation with the baddie that seems poorly explained and flimsy. But its not a big deal. This book is strictly for fun, and in that regard, it delivers bigtime."
3,Undead and Unwed,"There is a lot of really great things in this book, but I felt like the humor hit over kill."
3,Cutsie for the right mood,Written in the first person of a self described shallow beauty queen was well done. The premise is cute but you have to be in the mood to be silly. My first time picking it up I was looking for excape and this required too much choking the life out of my disbelief. I get it a second shot and was entertained.The obvious steriotyped characters were a bit grating. For example a gay vampire would be more fashion conscious. I would have wanted to see more breaks away from the ease of steriotypes from all characters beyond the story teller.The only thing is I really didn't find the gratuitious sex necessary for the story. I'm glad I did read it and find the sex because I would not have liked to hand it off to a younger niece. My sister in law would have bitten my head off for that sort of blunder.
1,Annoying and boring,"Is the author of this book 12 years old or what? I, as a reader, am not. Having read about half of this book I am starting to want to through it out the window. Why am I wasting my time? The main character keeps talking in circles and most of the time she will begin on one subject and go into about a hundred different subjects to make her point and then I am so confused that I have to reread her main subject to get the actual point she is trying to make. Kind of like talking to my teenage neices! There are parts that are funny but I actually want to strangle the main character because she is such an airhead. If you really want this book you need to ask yourself why."
1,Did I miss something?,"I ask you ladies, is not the whole romance book supposed to be about a man and woman who spend time with each other, and, oh I don't know fall in love? And at the end of the book wind up with each other or at the very least tell each other that they love the other?Now maybe I missed something (I did skip a few twenty pages or so of idotic drivel) but non of these things happened. They had sex yes, it was great. Yes, but no one was together and no one said they loved each other.That however was not the worst part. It was the idotic heroin (and I use that word lightly. Feather light.) Could anyone be nore vapid, self-centered and dare I say just plane stupid? I don't know maybe that was the whole point. All I know is that I'm never going to read another book by this author again."
4,A Fun Read - Don't expect literary genius,"I read this book after reading, You Slay Me by Katie MacAlister (which I did not enjoy). This is a vast improvement and I think this type of humor was what You Slay Me was trying to be. Sometimes you read a book for pure escapism and don't expect a lot, but I actually enjoyed this read.This is my first venture into vampire romantic COMEDY. I've read some of the Anita Blake series and found this a fun change. I am currently reading the 4th book in this ""Undead"" series and I think this one is the best so far (even though Undead and Unappreciated is also quite enjoyable). Betsy is a shoe-aholic who becomes a vampire. She later finds out she is the destined ""Vampire Queen."" I don't want to give much away, but it involves her misadventures in her new role. Even though the characters are not written with a lot of depth, (except for her best friend, Jessie), this is a fun read and I would recommend it."
4,Terrific Read,"Bets is one of the most self absorbed characters I've read who has an odd obsession with shoes. But, that makes the book really funny. Poor Bets she gets the shaft from her job, and then goes and winds up dead and gets more than she bargins for when she rises.The good, bad boy Eric Sinclair is a delicious character! I highly recommend reading this just for him alone {giggle}. No, seriously anyone who likes a good, laughable story with fangs this is the perfect thing to read. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!"
2,Eeeugh!,"I love vampire novels. I'm a fan of Yarbro, Rice, Hamilton, and a host of others. And I actually kind of liked this one up until the sex scene between Betsy and what's his face. I found the sex scene to be completely unexpected and totally useless to the plot of the book that I never got past it. I have no desire whatsoever to read another book in the series. Now I have nothing against sex. I completely love both of Hamilton's series: Anita Blake and Merry Gentry, so sex, even graphic sex, does not turn me either. I think the author spent so much time telling me how much Betsy hated him that I hated him too, and that her having sex with him just completely turned me off of the series."
4,Good Reading,I really enjoyed this book. Betsty is very funny (perhaps unintentionally) and her friends provide even more laughs. She's not very smart but you love her anyway.
2,Undead and Unreadable,"Besty Taylor is have a bad day. First she loses her job and then she loses her life. A few days later she wakes up in casket in a pink suite (a color she would not be caught dead in) and her step-monster cast off shoes. Now Besty has gone from being undead and unwed to being the Queen of the Vampires, a job that brings a whole new set of problems.I really wanted to like ""Undead and Unwed"" by Mary Janice Davidson but I could not. I found the character to be boring and interesting. Some may like this book but I was not one of them."
2,Undead and underwhelming,I was just looking for something light and entertaining to read. The story isn't bad but the writing is painful. The heroine is supposed to be twenty something but she talks and acts like she's thirteen. It was so painful I had to force myself to finish it. It was like Twilight all over. If you like Twilight or 50 Shades of Grey then you might like like the writing in this book. I feel dumber having read it.
3,Fun and Unpretentious,"I had a lot of laugh out loud fun reading this series during an extended travel. However, this is pretty juvenile, gimmicky stuff. Buy the books used and cheap and then pass them on to someone else. The leading character is impossibly silly--too silly to be the Queen of anything and her leading guy's diaglogue...well, let's just say that his dialogue was so corny it would be safe to say that the author does not characterize men very realistically. But this isn't a realistic book and I did enjoy it, silly as it was."
3,"It's like, ya know...!","A very silly book, but fun. Betsy is absolutely obnoxious and makes no apologies about it. (...). As Betsy would say: Yuck!Otherwise, it's just a fun bit of fluff to fill a few hours. Enjoy!"
4,A whole lot of laughs....,This book literally had me laughing from the very beginning. It was fun and very entertaining to read through out. I actually can't wait for Undead and Unemployed to come out.
4,Undead and Unwed,I love this book! It was laugh out loud funny!If you are looking for something in the vampiregenre that has Elizabeth Bevarly or Janet Evanovichtype charter you'll love Betsy. She maybe shallow andhave a shoe fetish but she is also loyal and kindhearted. Eric Sinclair is just as hot as Eric Northmanand Bill Compton! I highly recommend for a fun takeyour mind off life read.
1,YMMV,"I am a big fan of both irreverent vampire stories (like Buffy) and chick lit. This seemed like a nice mixture, but it was a struggle for me to finish it. I found the heroine so grating, the dialogue so ridiculous, and the humor so unfunny it was painful. Jokes like calling Sinclair ""Sink Lair"" were not funny to me the first time, and by the tenth, well, I was nigh homicidal. I see the intent, but for me it fell alarmingly flat.That said, there are so many positive reviews that obviously I am in the minority. My suggestion would be that you check out a few pages of it before you buy. If you find her sense of humor entertaining, then you'll enjoy the book. If not, well, put it back down, as I wish I had. Your mileage may vary, as always."
4,charming quick read...,"this book was an impulse buy and it's one of the few times i'm grateful i did...the book was utterly charming...betsy isn't necessarily the most likeable person (rather vain and self-involved with a sarcastic tongue that often gets her in trouble) but she's honest, loyal to her friends and family, and wants nothing more than to have her own life (so to speak)...it was just such an enjoyable fun read and i am eagerly awaiting the next in the series..."
3,Beach Read,"This is the kind of book you take for a day on the beach - simple, straightforward and check-your-brain-at-the-door. I'm never really impressed by the ""alternative"" vampires who are exempt from basic rules, but this was pretty much what it promised to be: mildly funny and a quick, easy read. If that's what you're looking for, you'll love it."
2,Hope it Gets Better,"After reading glowing reviews of this book, I was surprised to find it poorly written, with an unsympathetic character as our 'heroine'. The author, Davidson, isn't particularly good at developing different characters--Betsy doesn't have a strong 'voice' and some political commentary (from Betsy) seem both irrelevant and inappropriate to the story. While it does have 2 or 3 very funny moments it's not enough to carry the rest of the book. She has the potential to be a good writer but need a really tough editor. If you want well written, but light reading, look to Kim Harrison, Charlaine Harris or Tanya Huff. If you're just looking for fluff, this book will suit you fine."
2,Undead and Uninteresting,"This was recommended to me by a friend that I swap books with all the time. I value her opinion and her ability to sniff out great new vamp related authors. I may have to rethink that. Betsy doesn't want to be queen and you'll get your fill of her whining about why she shouldn't be, why she doesn't want to be and what a hardship it is that she's meant to be. I'm gonna have to agree with her step-mother here...she was better off dead."
1,CHECK OUT Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse Series for the real deal,"Anyone who found the Queen Betsy books disappointing should check out Charlaine Harris' excellent Southern Vampire series starring Sookie Stackhouse. It has a similar theme - modern vampires - but much better character development, writing, humor, plot... basically everything is better! Book # one is Dead Until Dark."
2,"IMMATURELY WRITTEN -""EWWWWWWWW!""","It's cute but the author has an immature style..too many ""oh it's blood EWWWWWW"" , ""EWWWWWWW"", and ""EWWWWWWWWWWW"" and ""oh that's his big penis EWWWWWWW"" comments...I think it would be great if these books were geared more toward YOUNG ADULT readers if not for the graphic sex parts..but as a MATURE ADULT I was somewhat annoyed by the immature dialog and that was distracting for me. I won't read the others in the series. Thank You."
2,Stupid heroine ruins everything,"I really wanted to like this book. I loved the premise. Sadly, the heroine of this book is just so DUMB that she droze me crazy. She is someone's bad impersonation of a ditz and does not come across as a real character at all, much less likable. Also the Big Sex Scene creeped me out and was definately not hot. I recommend a pass on this one."
2,Not Great.,"I loved the Twilight and Sookie Stackhouse series and needed something to fill my void after reading them. This did not do it! Besty is so obnoxious and annoying. Some funny stuff, but it got old quick. It was an easy read, so I finished it, but I will not be reading book two."
5,"You laugh, cry and cheer alot for this sexy vamp!","I first picked this book up at the library and couldn't put it down! Within the first sentence I was hooked. My favorite part is when she goes and gets all of her Manolos, Pradas, Guccis, Fendis and Ferragamos from her stepmother who thought she was dead so she stole all of her expensive shoes! Her mother doesn't care that she's dead just that's she's back and her dad couldn't be more scared of her! And then there is sexy Eric Sinclair and even though he's a vamp sex appeal just rolls off of him. You also have the side kicks Jessica and Marc who fight with each other over the attention of our Queen Betsey. It's a great series pick it up!!!"
4,Sassy!!,"A good friend recommended this book to me or I confess I would have never ordered it on my own. The cover alone was a turn off for me. But don't let it fool you! Betsy is one of the best female vamp characters to come along. She's sexy, brilliantly funny, and her wit is as sharp as a knife! The book reads very fast, and has just enough steamy romance to wet your appitite for the next in the series."
4,Funny Start to the Series,"Poor Betsy! First she is attacked in an alley by some nasty people (if you could call them that) that aren't that familiar with soap and water. Then she gets hit by a truck, thrown into a tree and dies. Then she wakes up only to realize that her horrible stepmother stole all her designer shoes, and oh yeah - she's now the undead.This is a laugh out loud start to a series that I'm anxious to continue reading. It's like really good chick lit mixed with vampires! A fun read."
2,If you need a no-brainer,"I enjoyed a strong woman character, Betsy, but I found the writing to be so infantile and less than exciting. I caught many grammar mistakes on top of it!It did keep me reading, but only because I'm bored as heck with the hurricane coming through. I don't know...I'd pass on this if I were you."
3,Bridge Jones Becomes A Vamp,"This is certainly an unusual book - at least, as far as I know. It's like Bridge Jones' Diary meets Anne Rice. And pretty sexy, really - I mean, if you don't mind blood sucking mixed with your romance novel sex scenes - and group sex, at that. It's a quick, fun read. Perfectly mindless, but humorous. I'd read it again and definitely think the author should keep writing books."
2,"Poorly Written, Cliche Story, Not Really Funny","This book was pretty disappointing. The writing is not very strong, and the book is also poorly edited (there were many repetitions, some grammatical and spelling errors, and it was just generally sloppy). The story was OK, but the main character (Betsy) is very annoying. The language doesn't bother me, but potential readers should be forewarned that this book does contain many swear words. The humor was on about a 12-year-old level: if you think constantly screwing up people's names (like calling Sinclair ""Sink Lair"") is funny, this is the book for you.I gave it two stars instead of one because it was marginally entertaining and didn't take long to read, but this is definitely one to pick up at the library instead of spending money on it."
3,undead & unwed,"I love Charlaine Harris, so I thought I'd try these books. The storyline was good, but Betsy Taylor was so annoying. She was so immature that it ruined the book for me, and I can rarely say that about a book. I think I'll try one more in this series though because they seem to be so popular."
3,"Coffin chick-lit? Amusing, but vapid.","I enjoyed this story, but the shallowness and deliberate ditziness of the main character became more of an annoyance than an endearing quirk. No great writing here, but it definitely qualifies as an amusing diversion for a rainy Saturday afternoon."
2,Couldn't get into it,I bought this book after reading the author's acknowledge page on one of her other books. I had high hopes because I liked her writing style given on that acknowledgment. Imagine my surprise when it took me a good month or so to plod through this book (and I'm a fast reader). I couldn't get into the weak storyline and even weaker plot. The characters were too unbelievable (and I'm a writer) and the author's overuse of the F word left a bad taste in my mouth. I probably won't be reading any more in this series.
5,If I can get Mom to read a vampire book,... then there are good things happening.This is a campy warm fuzzy vampire book for those who are intrigued by vampires but who are afraid of the bite-- don't worry-- Queen Betsy will cure you with SHOES....
3,Terrible but Funny,"While baby-sitting, I picked this one up and began reading it. It was very Bram Stoker meets Danielle Steel meets Lifetime Movie Network. But it was a fun read. It had absolutely no substance to it though. If you're looking for a book that will do nothing more than kill time, and bring on a few laughs, Its an excellent choice."
1,Annoying Annoying Annoying....and yes...Annoying,"""My bad"" to listen to some of the other readers on this one. You may ask ""How can so many readers be wrong?"" about this book and my answer would be almost everyone! I could not take another minute from the main character Betsy. PLEASE STAY AWAY...STAY FAR AWAY! Betsy and Sinclair had NO CHEMISTRY...I mean non...zip. The writing sucked... big time. How could this book get by a publisher."
2,Not my style,"I have recently read Kelley Armstrong's ""Woman of the Otherworld"" and Kim Harrison's ""Dead Witch Walking"" and expected Undead & Unwed to be similair to them since Amazon recommended it to me, however I was very dissappointed. I could not really enjoy this book because I didn't really find the main character (Betsy) to be very interesting. She is flitty and self centered, which is suppose to make the book -oh-so funny- however I just found it rather annoying. Also, there is a lot of pointless sex in this book, that really adds nothing to the plot(although there is not much plot to begin with). This book reads more like a trashy romance novel than a vampire fantasy. I was so dissapointed that I don't intend to continue the series. If you are a fan of Armstrong and Harrison, stern clear of this series!"
2,Kind of Juvenile,"Zero depth. I just didn't like the main character. It was like reading about a teenager who was supposed to be in her 30's. I'm in my 30's and don't relate to this character at all. On the upside, it didn't take me very long to read. The language is suitable for a 5th grader, so I blasted through it in two sittings."
3,Unapologetic Fun!,"Mary Janice Davidson first hits gold with her compilation of sassy contemporary romance Under Cover that brought her under the wing of Brava. Her first full length novel with Berkeley, Undead and Unwed, retains the sass and the brio - manifested in the pert heroine Betsy Taylor who rises from the dead to battle with a 500-year old vampire, Nostro as well as her manipulative stepmother who stole her Manolo Blahniks upon her death. The laughs are fast and furious especially with an ensemble of secondary characters like her loyal friend Jess and a gay sidekick. It is a vampire parody that digs from the closets of Dracula 2000, Buffy and even a stab at fellow paranormal writers when Betsy has the power to defy holy water and sunlight. It is unfortunate that the end sags but the delicious romance with brooding hero Eric Sinclair more than compensates. This outing proves that Ms. Davidson is uncompromising and undaunted to be creative. It is macabre, refreshing and savagely funny."
4,"Very, very funny","She hits the nail right on the head. The characters are very funny. I wish the book hadn't ended so abruptly, but hey no one is perfect. If you over tired of Anita Blake and underwhelmed with the Dark Hunter series, this is a very promising new series."
3,Charlaine Harris versus the Devil wears Prada.,"This book is a light fluffy read. Its very much like reading Charlaine Harris' vampire series crossed with The Devil wears Prada. The heroine is vapid and emptyheaded and obsessed with shoes. She is definitely not a 'strong' character if you are used to the Anita Blake series. Very disappointing. Not worth full price, I recommend checking it out from the library or buying a used copy if you have nothing else to read."
2,Not for me,The book was too silly. I didn't care what happened to the characters. Juvenile writing with adult content. Nope. It's not for me.
3,Whats With The Ending?,"A little bit disappointed with the ending of this one, but it leaves the door wide open for the next book in the series to HOPEFULLY figure out what in the world is going on with Sookie and Eric. Thankfully the book and the TV Series, Tru Blood, do not go hand in hand so now spoiler alerts if you watch the show and read the books."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is without a doubt the worst novel I have read in a very long time. Davidson's writing style resembles that of a teenager just learning about stream of consciousness. There is no sense to her dialogue; the actions are hard to follow, and worst of all, the novel is a cliche' from beginning to end. While she may have been attempting to use all of the vampire cliches' to prove why Betsy is NOT one, she failed. I purchased all of the first three of this series at the same time, which proved to be a waste of money. I finished the first one and haven't had the stomach to open the second. If you want something to read just to pass the time on the beach or an airplane, this might be an okay read. Otherwise, invest your time and money in something far more worthwhile."
1,"Ewww, yech!!!","I am a fan of the genre, but Ms. Davidson should get a day job if she doesn't already have one! The plot is thin, the vamp references are uneven and she seems to ""borrow"" a lot from other really good authors with her ""catch phrases"" (ie, f**k-me pumps, etc.). The whole story feels bumpy, and about a third of the way through I found myself wishing ol' Buffy herself would swoop in and dust the whole lot of them. If you want to read a really funny and well written vampire genre book, try the ""Dead"" series by Charlaine Harris or a book called Carpe Demon, by Jule Kenner, about a vampire slayer soccer mom. Now that is a great read that a lot of women will really relate to! Peace."
1,Horrible!!!,"The character of Besty is extremly annoying. She has no depth to her and her shallowness stays throughout the whole series. I also thought her relationship with Sinclair was horrible!!! Do not read this book, instead pick up the sookie stackhouse novels which are far better written."
3,I probably shouldn't be writing this review..,"This book was recommended by a friend so although I rarely read fiction, I thought it might be a nice change.Didn't like it. It's basically a romance novel with some quirky characters and a different type of story line. The main character gets fired, gets killed and turns into a vampire... one who can walk around in daylight. I did not like the main character as although I'm all for shopping and shoes, she got on my nerves. Maybe it's my age (over 50)But I know people who rave about the entire series."
2,Do yourself a favor and skip this series,"I've been reading vampire books since before they were popular, and I've read every vampire series I've come across.Everything from Vampirates to Anne Rice and everything else including the popular Twilight saga, The Vampire Diaries, and the Sookie Stackhouse series.I thoroughly enjoyed every other series I've encountered, delighting in all the different vampire interpretations each author presented.I'm sad to say that this series was dry and not very funny as it was advertised to be. The characters weren't very likeable and the writing wasn'tvery polished, I felt like I was reading a high school manuscript.I only read the first book, because I just couldn't bear to read one more word, and honestly it was a struggle to even finish the book.I gave it two stars for the original story line."
3,365 Days review,"a realistic recounting of a horrific war. For those not familiar with war, it was difficult to make sense of the abbreviations and terminology used by the author. The unimaginable stories added to my respect for the vets."
5,Great low calorie treat for overweight dogs or for training treats!,"All Natural Dog Treats by Charlee Bear - Cheese & Egg - 16 oz resealable bagThese are absolutely great treats for training and for use with overweight dogs. At only 4 calories per treat, even an overweight dog can feel like they are getting treats too, especially in a multi-dog household where one dog is overweight, others are not. Taste must be wonderful since there isn't anything my dogs won't do for these tiny treats, so I'm very pleased with them for many reasons! GREAT PRODUCTS!!!"
3,Recycled melodrama from daytime soap operas!,"Watching More tales from the city on DVD was like watching a good sopa opera on t.v., except this has swearing and nudity (male and female). The quality of the DVD transfer is great, excellent quality. Haven't ever read the books that these episodes were based on and did not know what to expect, overall is was enjoyable watching the lives of these group of weird people living in the same building in San Francisco. But it definitely borders on a soap opera, but in a Fassbinder kind of way. Recycled stories (that are intertwined) given new life, by a somewhat mediocore cast."
3,More tales...,"...misses the mark. The miniseries ""Tales of the City"" was magical and flawless; I've replayed scenes over and over again marvelling at how perfectly written, acted, photographed, and directed the movie was.""More Tales"" is interesting but it's disappointing. The cast is terrific (though I miss the original Mouse and Mona), the story is great, but it's not great moviemaking.Someone needs to remake this one."
2,Horrible Disappointment,"Having read and adored Armistead Maupin's 'Tales of the City' novels, I was delightfully surprised with the FIRST television adaptation ('Tales of the City'.) I was, however, horribly disappointed with this second series. The first series was beautifully cast, the 'chemistry' between the characters a chief concern. Certain characters have been RE-cast in this second series, and none of them are - to my mind - as 'right' as the original cast (furthermore, it was somewhat disconcerting to see the character of 'Mona' wearing the same WIG in each series, but crowning a different FACE!) My real problem with 'More Tales of the City' is its pace; the first series (like the first books) is very fast paced - this series is a real plodder. It's worth renting out of interest, but I wouldn't buy it. (Sorry, Amazon.com! I'll make up for any lost sales by STRONGLY recommending the FIRST series be bought, watched, RE-watched and enjoyed many times over!)"
5,Loved it from start to finish,"I've read all the books and loved them, but what thrills me about this is that I can see all the people I loved in the books fleshed out. I know some people didn't like the chages that where made with the charaters, but I didn't mind then at all. In fact I liked this cast better then the first. It had more depth and more chemistry. I enjoyed all the story lines but the one I enjoyed the most was Mouse and Jon. I was deepely sadden when they broke up in the first series, but like most people I love happy endings, and we get one here. For the most part. I hope they are going to make the next book, I would love to see how they translate it for the screen."
5,Visiting the city,"A few years ago I stumbled on the Tales Of the City and fell in love with everyone. I was so disappointed when the show was over. The character development is wonderful, you start genuinely caring and ""rooting"" for people. The shows conclusion is perfect, and you are left to shake your head at the fact that someone can write lines so perfectly and actors can deliver them so honostly. I have missed everyone at 28 Barbary Lane, and now the fact that I can own them all, on DVD none the less, and with all these extras, all I can say is, Excellent! I recommend ""Tales"" to anyone who loves a great story with real characters."
5,A Beautiful Series - A must have,"I had always heard of this series from Showtime. Then I finally got a chance to watch the series. I figured I would watch one episode a night. The first episode was so good that I watched the second, third and before I knew it I had watched both discs. This is a great value, very captivating series. I loved every episode and I could easily watch all the episodes again!"
4,Still holds up,An excellent and faithful adaptation of Armistead Maupin's hugely enjoyable and seminal books. Stand-out performances by Olympia Dukakis as the transgendered Mrs Madrigal and the late great Jackie Burroughs as Mother Mucca. Some have complained of the re-casting of the Michael Tolliver role from the firstl PBS adaptation of Tales Of The City but I would say that Paul Hopkins who replaces Marcus D'Amico is truer to the spirit of the period (the 70's) and sexier. Definitely worth watching and better still re-read the wonderful books.
5,Motherhood can be a camp,"This series has something for everybody, a touch of Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf,Alfred Hitchcock and It is so off beat as to bring a cool wind of refreshing truth to the dull a gray everyday life we all lead for the most part And the Grandmother is to die for, she had me rolling in the isles. Warning it is definite ""R"" rated, but even the ""R"" rated scenes are professionally incorporated into the story to make it flow and not for their shock or peeping tom value.Your life will be enriched if you join this coterie of misfits and their adventures in every day living. Don't mistake this for a Soap Opera, though it uses some of the shell silhouette characters but does them better with more life. The people are real, have physical and emptional blemishes which enriches the belief in the reader. Get This Video set, you will never regret it."
1,Frivolous,"Another expense to tackle on a poor unsuspecting customer. You gotta love how at least 10-15% of your phone bill are tacked-on phony charges. I am never happy when I have to dip into my pocket yet again for more inane expenses, but then who is?"
2,Rather disappointed...,"Unless you did not buy the Totally Pokemon CD (which I'm sure any Poke-fan already got), then this CD is not a good buy. I loved last year's Pokemon the Movie 2000 soundtrack, because we got to listen to some great, big power stars like Donna Summer, Weird Al and the amazing B-52s croon cool new Pokemon tunes. I guess Warner Bros didn't feel like shelling out any major money this time around. (Rumor has it that Pokemon 3 will be the last Poke-film Warner Bros will release in theaters) Only two new songs are on this CD, plus a melody of the film's score, while the other nine are directly from the Totally Pokemon CD. I enjoyed the first two tracks from the movie, but it really isn't worth buying the CD just for those two songs. If the older tracks had been remixes of the original songs, then this CD might have gotten a higher score, but as it is... still, if you do not yet have the Totally Pokemon CD, then this is a good buy for you."
1,I don't even wanna know...,"Ok, how do I phrase this CD??? Uhhhh, bad? Corectamudo!(Ei ca rumba!) I don't think i even wanna know what songs are on here. What kind of songs would be on a POKEMON CD???? They're propably all in Japanees junk or somthing, but the point is, you can't understand it anyway!!! For all you Japaneese, fanatics, Konichiwa! (you probably don't even know what that means!!) PS~that 1 star up there is being WAY to nice! DIGIMON ROCKS!!!!!"
2,Not as good as the movie. OK though,"If you are looking for a soundtrack similar to the other Pokemon movie soundtracks, you are WRONG! This CD only had like 4 or 5 songs worth listening to. Atlantic Records should have made this because frankly KOCH records doesn't do a good job with this CD. I liked their other Pokemon CDs (2BA Master and others). Pointless in buying. I was hoping for some better sounding songs. Oh well, I guess this one will have to do until Pokemon 4 comes out."
2,"Well, there goes another shoddy PKMN album.....","This album contains songs from the Pokemon Johto series, and it's one of the worst groups of Pokemon songs I've heard. The songs, although (sometimes) relevant to the Pokemon series, are written by pop groups favoured by children of about 8-11, and feature little or no actual emotion. The songs (like the bands) all sound the same too, which makes it drag on and on for what seems like eternity. The only redeeming feature of the album is 'Two Perfect Girls', sung by Brock. This song is relatively fun, and has a catchy tune. But that's where the good side ends.For children who really adore Pokemon, it's for you. But it's things like this that can really put you off Pokemon if you're only a half-time fan."
3,Wonder if Pokémon 4 will even have a soundtrack.,"Like everyone else has said, this is almost identical to ""Totally Pokémon"" and if you own that, well, not really a whole lot of reason to get this one. I don't have ""Totally Pokémon"" so I decided to pick this one up. I liked it. The new mix of the theme was nice and some of the songs from the TV show were okay, but like someone has already said, they feel way more bubblegum pop rock than ""2BA Master."" One or two of the songs were fun but some were...ugh...my roommate almost went crazy watching the video to PokéRap GS. Overall, it was worth what I spent because I don't own ""Totally"" but I think this could have been a better soundtrack if they would have just put the new theme, the ""Know the Unknown"" song, and then filled up the rest of the CD with the score (I liked the medley included on here). If you're a big PKMN fan, then buy this. But if you're a casual fan who owns ""Totally"" ya might want to think hard about buying this one."
4,Actually 3 1/2 stars.,"If Pokemon's popularity is waning, at least they went out with a great movie. Unfortunately they could have done a better job with the soundtrack. Now unlike some of the other reviewers here, I do not have ""Totally Pokemon,"" so I was hearing most of these songs for the first time. They range from okay to really good (I really like ""All We Wanna Do"" and ""Song of Jigglypuff""), but the three best tracks by far are the ones from the movie itself. ""Pokemon Johto--Movie Version"" is MUCH better than the TV version, in my opinion, and Innosense gives a great performance on ""To Know the Unknown."" The one score track, ""Medley from 'Spell of the Unown',"" isn't the BEST selection from the score, but still good. This raises the question: Why didn't they just release a disc with the whole score plus those two songs instead of all this rehash? I certainly would have preferred that. If you don't already have ""Totally Pokemon,"" as I don't, then this disc isn't a bad buy. If you do, well--"
3,Good,I like that song to know the unkown by innosense thats a beautifull song the movie was great. I got the tape in 2001 a couple of days after the release this soundtrack was good to.
4,Loves Music,"My son, who just turned 11, loves this CD, except the ""mushy"" parts. (but what do you expect). Was a soundtrack for his birthday party."
3,Could've been better...,"The CD starts off really, really good. I just love the movie intro to Pokemon the 3rd movie. Unfortunately, there's only three new songs(two being the good intro to the CD) and the rest comes from the Totally Pokemon CD. I was hoping that there would be more new songs to it. I think it's because the record studio couldn't find anybody who would compose some new songs for them. However, you must be a hardcore pokemon fan(like me) to buy this CD. Otherwise, buy it used or buy Totally Pokemon if you never heard it."
3,Totally Pokemon TAKE 2....,"Well, everyone else has pretty much said it already, but...Yes, this is pretty much the CD Totally Pokemon with 2 more tracks. It's kind of disappointing, seeing how much went into the previous two soundtracks (Dance Of Bellossum, lol), and how little went into this.It just seems that they gave up during this movie and that laziness dragged over into the release of MEWTWO RETURNS (which was great, don't get me wrong, it just seemed they could have put some serious work into it).Well, since I gave Totally Pokemon I good rating, I can't necessarily give this a bad rating; but since it's basically a re-release (with the exception of 2 songs and some videos on this enhanced disc), I couldn't give it 5 stars.But it's a good pick-up if you don't already have Totally Pokemon and/or if you are just looking to get every U.S. released Pokemon cd."
2,Not the Best Resource for a Wonderful Tool for Growth,"The Enneagram is a powerful tool for understanding oneself and others. Where the authors stick to the classic system they do a good job in explaining the types, the issues, and paths for growth. However, where they felt the need to have a ""breakthrough"" to market their approach as new and improved, they actually do violence to the system and reduce its usefulness. Their diagnosis of each of the types as problems with doing, thinking or feeling and the resultant prescriptions for growth, hold up for some types but not others. They then lose all of the helpfulness of the movement toward integration and disintegration between enneagram types. I've read many books on the enneagram and found this the least helpful."
4,Advances in Automatic Text Summarization,Now I need to collect research papers about text summarization. It is happy to find the book including papers about text summarzation. I wish this book describes the techniques of text summarization rather than an collection of research papers.
4,"Pretty good book, but I have a few problems with it","This book is great for those of us who like stories with a twist, stories about Mardi Gras, or just plain good reading. Overall, I think it is a great collection of short stories that, for the most part, are entertaining to read.Here's one of the main problems that I have with the book. If it's a collection of stories about New Orleans Mardi Gras, why do most of the stories appear to be written by British authors? If you look, you'll see some traits of UK vocabulary and spelling, such as using ""realise"" when a US author would have spelled it ""realize"". That doesn't give these authors as much credibility to me, but, who really cares?I think the last story of the book was DEFINITELY the best. If you've ever been to New Orleans and done one of the Haunted History tours, you'll surely recognize the characters in this story. Wonderful!!"
3,A humorous adventure by a rounder enjoying casual living,"Allan Bosworth was a cowboy author of not in the thirties and forties. He lived in a little cabin on Redwood Retreat Rd near Morgan Hill Ca. He enjoyed his stay, and his humorous accounts reflect his casual approach to life. This is a fun and quick read."
3,First outting,"Its not surprising Nancy Sinatra's first and best-known album is not her best. The songs included here were an obvious attempt to cash in on the ""Boots"" phenomenon. Nancy shines, the best she can, on material that made others famous. No surprises here, just cutting vocals of mediocre songs."
3,Boots by Nancy Somatra,I bought this for our grand daughter who did a dance routine to it. She is seven years old and really enjoyed the CD. This also brought back memories for us.
5,Love It!,"This is a great album. If you are a fan, this album has it all. Gret vocals, melodies, and a super mix of anthem and ballad."
5,A masterpiece,"""These Boots"" always seemed like a funny novelty song; so, like many others, I discarded Nancy Sinatra as a one-hit wonder who cashed in on that famous relative. But this album is a pop masterpiece that is totally evocative of its era. It only could have been recorded in 1966. It's a wondrous mishmash of musical currents: loungy bossa nova, bright Memphis horns, David Rose-style bump-and-grind, easy listening choruses, catchy bumblegum pop, and bold Vegas showstopping. And it all works! The mostly forgotten Lee Hazlewood, who produced the album, was a genius who had a finely tuned ear for commercial music. He crafted Nancy's wholly fabricated tough-chick image to ride on top of his brilliant arrangements. This is one of the most listenable albums of the '60s. When it plays I feel I'm cruising down the Sunset Strip in a convertible ogling mini-skirted girls in front of the Whisky Au Go Go."
4,"Harry Bosch fans - this is the ""lost light"" album","This is the music Harry talks about in ""Lost Light."" Good Stuff"
1,Never received the product!!!,This is more of a review on Amazon not the CD... Sorry. I'm sure the CD is fabulous. I ordered this CD June 20th as a back up just in case the harpist did not show for our wedding on June 25th. I had it shipped over night and the CD never showed. I'm still waiting on a credit from Amazon. Good thing our harpist showed. Thanks for nothing Amazon!
1,DO NOT BUY IT!,"This DVD REcorder will cause you more heart ache than any other piece of electronics you have. We bought this because of some previous reviews claiming how easy it was to use etc.After two weeks it locked up and could not be fixed. Had to ship back to Ilo at my expense. They claimed to have fixed it, but what showed up was a banged up version that clearly was not the one I sent them. But I was happy to have an Ilo back so I tried it out. After recording 1 program (less than 12 hours in my hands) the Ilo locked up again with flashing lights this time....Clearly this a crappy product. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,This is not a good recorder or value,"We bought the Ilo DVD recorder from a competitor, not Amazon but after only 6 weeks are returning it. It locks up so badly when trying to edit it had to be unplugged to reset. It destroys the file when it locks up and finally the hard drive locked completely, won't defrag and we lost everything that was on it. Other than that it's fine."
5,Great recorder for a beginner.,This unit has been of a great help in organizing my family videos and converting them from other video sources. Especially the digital video input. This has a fantastic quality that copying with rca cables will not allow alone. I am very happy with my purchase.
5,Wonderful songs,The songs featured in this CD soundtrack remind me of the songs of some of my favorite Broadway musicals. These are the kind of songs which I enjoy most. This CD didn't disappoint.
1,Dreadful copies...,"Believe it or not our kids love these old Red Skelton shows. (They are currently 8 and 10 years of age.) So we've bought various videos in both CD and DVD formats. This one by Brentwood Home Video is by far the worst video of any sort we've ever run across. The pictures are fuzzy and there has been no 'cleanup' of either the audio or the video. In addition, the DVD just stopped at one point in the second show. No scratch, just nothing. Our experience was so bad we didn't even bother to investigate to see what the problem could have been.Available for a penny for a good reason.Pam T~mom and blogger"
5,Goddess T. - 'Electric Shiatsu' (Outer Music),"This Goddess T. project sounds a lot like Mother Gong.And so it should,because it's core line-up is Gilli Smyth,Daevid Allen and their son Orlando Allen.If you're a Gong fan,you should get plenty enjoyable plays from 'Electric Shiatsu' as I have.Some of the outstanding tracks would be ""Sugar Path"",""Triple Helix"",the nicely done poetic ""Sirius Ma"" and the twenty-minute quite spacey ""Journey Of The White Whale"".Truly incredible!Through out the eight song/68:10 minute disc,I'm SURE I hear sitar,tabla and pure electronic-style trancedelic that's probably a bit to 'out there' and eerie for some.Like I said before,if you like Gong,or EVEN any Gong-related releases,you will dig this CD.Not a bad cover either."
2,not worth the money,"the skull had was really poorly put together. The glue never set on the cribriform plate, so it was loose. I really just wanted to dissolve all the glue and put it back together myself. Also, some of the foramina weren't present. I think it would have been worth the extra money to get one of the more expensive skulls."
5,Great Original LA Ska Band live recording!,"The Untouchables are an original band! One of the first bands from the LA ska scene. Their sound is a mix of ska, good 'ol rock'n'roll and a little bit of funk. Great horn section. This album was recorded live at the Roxy in 1989, and is high quality. Has all of their best songs and really is a live greatest hits type album."
3,A good 1950's gangster movie,Jack Palance plays one of his typecast movie roles as the quiet loner. The only difference here is that instead of being a cowboy he plays a gangster who despite being a stone cold killer has a soft spot for a naive disabled girl. Shelly Winters plays a trampy gangster chick who falls for Jack and despite his rejections manages to change his heart and feelings for her. A great movie for the gangster movie buff with all the old style clothes and cars this movie is one of my favorites. A modern ganster movie with a similar theme is Harvey Kietel's role in Industry City.
3,High-tech head bump measurement,"While this book is an excellent, but intensive, book discussing the neurological function of the brain, it thumps an anti-religion undertone proclaiming we are nothing but a collection of electrochemicals that dictate behavior from primordial oceans over a billion years ago.Modern brain research is on a direct collision course with thousands of years of religious philosophy. One field denies that we may very well be an immortal spirit using the brain like one drives a car. The other screams ""See this, you ARE the brain and nothing else because we cannot measure it."" When you read this, keep your critical eye in high gear.Maybe fifty years from now, we may look at this book with the Freudian era practice of measuring intelligence by associating it with physical brain size and the number of head bumps. Only this time they are using MRIs and electron microscopes instead of just a caliper to measure the brain."
5,GREAT BOOK !!!!,Loads of info and thoughtful insight into getting anyones health back with one of Nature's great gifts---raw goats milk !!!!!
5,Wire Strippers,Man this tool is a tooth saver. Just easy to use and strips any wires that Im working with. Id buy this tool if I were an installer as well.
1,Poor quality,I returned this item. Very poor quality. Didn't work without marring the wire! I ended up buying something used on ebay that worked better.
5,automatic wire stripper,"Nice and hefty, cut and strips wire in a jiffy. Used for 20 ends (for 5 speakers on both ends, with 2wires apiece ) and got it done in less than 10 minutes. Minimal wire loss at the ends, it strips wires better than if I were to do it with the older, more traditional strippers.Oh and I stripped 12 gauge wire, no problem"
3,They work if....,"They are adjusted properly. They have a tension adjuster and if it's not set right it will just cut your wire right off rather then just strip it.A good little tool to have, but not a replacement to your regular wire strippers."
1,Cheap Junk!!,Cut copper on every wire I stripped. Adjusted it throughout its entire range of adjustment. The feeling changed but it had almost no impact to how much copper came off.It is literally worthless; I can't use it. Waste of money.
5,Great book,"I have a worn out copy of this book in my kitchen. I use and abuse it as much as I can. Thus far, everything I have made is totally yummo. The food is fresh and healthy, just the way we Aussies love it. Bill Granger is famous for his great breakfasts, but I actually believe he is the king of desserts! The book has lovely pictures of the finished recipes which I always enjoy - at least you have some idea of what the food should look like when your done. Goodo Bill....your best book ever."
4,Cain and Abel at Work is a valuable tool for the workplace,"I found this book to be useful in explaining why so often the people who get ahead in the workplace aren't the hard workers but the connivers and the maneuverers. This book helps the hard workers recognize a Cain at work, and fight back without resorting to Cain's tactics. An interesting premise that is of real practical use."
2,Little practical advice,This book just tell you that there are some nasty people around but provide very little insight on how those people should be dealt with.
3,About 1/2 of what you'll need...,Reviewed all of the tests included in this study-guide. Many of the questions were on the actual test and I would not have known the answers without having studied this guide. I also read an entire 'Intro. to Law Enforcement' classroom text prior to my DANTES test. The test includes many more questions regarding the 'criminal justice' system than I expected as well as several questions regarding current day law enforcement statistics. Neither this study-guide nor the text prepared me for all of these questions. Review of this guide as well reviewing a guide for the DANTES Criminal Justice test would probably been a more appropriate use of time.
1,Intro to law enforcement,"This study guide in no way prepared me for the dantes exam. I spent along time sudying the guide and knew the material very well, but when I took the test none of the material was on it. The test was completely different and I failed it. It was a waste of time and money, I am now apprehensive to buy any other Rudman study guides. I would suggest to save your money and not buy this one."
2,To young to die but to old to read a personal psycho diary!,"Can please somebody tell me about what is this book?1) It is certainly not about lucid dreaming.2) It has no practical lessons or values in shamanism or other paths.3) It is not a travel guide to Samarkand (town where most of the action in the book is placed in).So if your interest is within these fields, then in my opinion, invest your time/life in some other book."
2,What does this have to do with lucid dreams?,"I was disappointed in ""The Master of Lucid Dreams."" While the story was entertaining and had some interesting psychological theories about dealing with trauma, the connection to lucid dreams was tenuous. The author and her teacher frequently discuss the important of conscious dreaming, but they provide no information on how to achieve it. Go ahead and get this book if you're interested in healing trauma, but don't bother if you want practical information on lucid dreams."
1,Disappointed,I was looking for a carpet sweeper to pick up crumbs from messy kids (and adults) after meals. We have an area rug in the kitchen - low pile and needed a quick pick up. This sweeper just didn't do it - would only pick up large crumbs. Not at all useful.
2,Disappointed,"What a disappoimtment! After using our loyal Bissell in the restaurant biz for several years, I expected similar performance from this. Nope. It does a poor job of picking up crumbs and dog hair, my daily foes. After replacing this Sweeper with the Go-Vac, I am now very satisfied. The Sweeper does, surprisingly, pull the carpet nap upright for a ""freshened"" look."
3,Bissell 26706 Sweeper,It is effective for the job but it is smaller than I thought I was buying - it looks like a child's one. I would have returned it to buy a Turbo sweeper but I had opened it. The last part of the handle is difficult for me to make it stay. It keeps coming away from the main stick.
2,Not impressed,"Did I really pay $30 for this? The handle design is awful - it keeps coming apart. When I empty the tray, it is full of dog hair, which means it does pick that up very well. However, it does not pick up much lint, paper, threads, etc. that collect on carpets and rugs. I guess I'll be spending money on something else to do the job now. How frustrating."
5,A Perfect Carpet & Floor Sweeper,"Bissell's 2650 is labeled, ""Perfect Sweep"": a totally accurate description.After reading its reviews & being thoroughly disenchanted with the higher-priced Hoky 2600, I purchased this gem of a manual carpet/floor sweeper. Assembled within minutes, it cleaned the type of debris consistently abandoned by its rubber-rotored competitor. The Bissell Perfect Sweep has two 9"" brush rollers & four corner brushes. It's equally effective on carpet & bare floors. As the handle lies flat, it cleans under sofas, chairs, & barstools with ease. Its sturdy steel construction is still lightweight enough to permit single hand use. It cleans on both forward & reverse motions; the debris remains in the dirt pans until I empty them...No surprise dumping! It is the perfect complement to my serious-cleaning-only vacuum.Its best feature: it's so budget-friendly. At less than $30, it makes a really great holiday gift. Yeah!!"
2,disappointed,"While the sweeper does do an excellent job of sweeping up everything on the kitchen floor, the next time you use it it dumps most of the debris back on the floor. I have tried emptying the containers, rolling and using the comb to clean the bottom. No luck. It still dumps dirt on the floor at the beginning of each use. You then have to sweep over the pile several times to get it picked up again. The handle also has come apart but that I can live with. The base of the unit is a large square and even though I have a large floor it would be more useful if it was smaller and more rectangular. If you have a small kitchen floor that is not an open rectangle for cleaning the size may be a problem. I should probably have sent it back since it is more work to clean with it. But I keep hoping I can figure out why it is dumping debris. If I could get it to stop doing it it would be useful."
2,good idea not well made,"as mentioned by someone else.the parts ofthe handle keep falling apart.and the cleaning tool keeps falling off.some debris falls through the bottom through cracks.but it still has been a great help in cleaning up from infants after feeding (cherrios, crumbs etc..)I am now looking for a different model by either same or different company, which does not havethese problems."
4,I've used better but this is good,"For the price, this is good for spot cleaning crumbs and small areas. Obviously, it cannot replace a vacuum. It does come apart a little too easy, but this happens when my sons use it."
2,Doesn't work very well,"I bought this item after frustration with my electric sweeper not being able to pick up in corners, etc. So, I thought I'd do away with fancy and get back-to-basics. This is not the sweeper for that. I have a tile floor in the kitchen so it's an uneven surface. This sweeper doesn't pick up anything on that floor. OK, I thought, I'll just use it on my hardwoods. Nope, doesn't pick up anything either. I have to go over and over and over the same piece of dirt to get it to pick up. It doesn't even pick up Cheerios! As a test I put uncooked rice on the floor in a pile. It hardly picked up anything. So, don't waste your money. My old-fashioned broom works much better with the same amount of effort."
4,Handy sweeper,This product is lightweight and easy to use. It cleans up small messes when you don't want to deal with a large vacuum cleaner. It does not need to be plugged in or recharged and therefore is even quiet. We are pleased with ours.
4,College memories...,"First saw this movie in college - my roommate had it on VHS, and it was crazy - never had seen such a thing before! Remembered it - looked on Amazon - found it! Good to watch while in an ""altered state"" of your choice! Very funny, quite racist, not politically correct in any way!"
2,Too late for me,"I was in high school in '72 and missed this one and I'm sure I probably would've enjoyed it more back then in my stoner daze. I couldn't even smirk at it now. Some interesting commentary on the times, intellectuals, radicals, sort of an animated On The Road complete with cheesey funky jazzy fuzz guitared music, but I'm really glad I had the trusty fast foward button handy."
4,Pretty much as expected . . . .,Ralph Bakshi fans everywhere will appreciate this movie - nothing subtle about the social satire delivered inherent throughout the story
4,Fritz the Cat,A great old movie from a character by Robert Crumb. Animated feature that had an initial X rating but would probably be rated R today. Plot involves the adventures of a college student (Fritz) as he explores the world of sex and drugs and gets into lots of trouble along the way. Entertaining and funny with a large component of social commentary included.
1,A must for anyone who can not think strait.,"Fritz the Cat may be an interesting movie, but as for anything else one prizes in movies, it lacks. No plot, cookie cutter characters, and a moral (if you want to call it that) which is so random and scattered it would take Steven Hawkins about 50 years to really understand. I also beleive that the writer of this movie has forgotten what it was he wanted to say, because massive brain damage since."
1,Never Again.,"I never received this product and will not order from you again. When there is a problem, you are not easy to reach."
1,I walked out of the Theater on this flick....,"I was a Sophomore in HS and went to this cartoon with my cousins, What a mistake! I walked out and sat in the car till it was over. It was awful. I think it is sick that even grown ups think this is so amusing to watch cartoon characters have sex. I wouldn't even rate it a ""1"" star. More like Zero Stars."
5,Excellent Social Satire,"Ralph Bakshi's first film, is flawed but enjoyable. It is about Cat in a romp through the 1960's in New York through sex drugs and Rock and Roll. The film starts off funny then ends up depressing. What the movie essentially is, is a satire on the counter culture of the 1960's. It is one of Ralph Bakshi's best, and definitely worth a look."
3,"GNARLY, FUNKY, OBSCENE AND FUNNY","Originally X-rated, the notorious and successful ""FRITZ THE CAT"" is now available on DVD. Animator Ralph Bakshi adapted several comic strip stories from counter culture artist Robert Crumb about a shallow college guy who hits on anything in a skirt.In 1972 it was shocking to see cartoons using crude language and in lewd situations. Gritty, violent and racist, Fritz (he ends up on the road with a biker gang to blow up America) caught a lot of heat and made a ton of money. Incidentally, Crumb hated the film and continued his comic strip and skewered Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz and killed off Fritz (a jealous girlfriend did the deed).The radical 60s as seen through the distorted lens of a million psychedelic animation cells. ""Fritz the Cat"" is a freak show that still shocks and yes, it's funny as hell. But just sometimes. If this is too offensive, there's always ""LAND BEFORE TIME VIII."""
2,Dated.,This is the most dated movie I have ever watched and its a cartoon! Fritz the Cat was made in 1972 when there was a revelution. I want to know why people care about that stuff anymore I mean we are in the 2000s now and we need to move on. now back to the movie this movie has adult language and talks about sex a lot but thats not a big deal anymore because every movie does now. This movie is dated and old and should be thrown away into Theatre Alley.
4,"Fritz the cat ""holywood style""","Too bad the end has been altered in a happy ending, the original I saw in 1972 had Fritz slain by a revengeful feminist, an ice pick was the weapon. Much stronger and relevant."
4,Animated history of the sixties,"FRITZ THE CAT is not only an homage to R. Crumb and the underground comics of the sixties but also serves as a history of the sixties era itself. From New York City, where the folk scene started to the west coast, Fritz shows us the elements that made up that time. Drugs, sex rock and roll, Manson, and the eventual falling apart of the whole scene. All of it done in cartoon form! Great film for folkies, hippies, speed-freak bikers and anyone else that lived during that time."
2,Not what Crumb wanted,"R. Crumb, underground comix legend and creator of Fritz the Cat, hated this movie. One can understand why, with the one dimensional characters and lame excuse for a plot. The animation is well done, but doesn't feel like a work of Crumbs (which it is not). You are better off sticking to the comix and staying away from this movie, that way you'll get a better idea of what Fritz was meant to be."
3,A shocking but very entertaining film...,"The story concerns a classic 60's hero, Fritz, and his adventures through the urban underground... He loves sex and constantly claims and declares the glories of revolution... At first he is happy with just sex, but as the story moves through exotic adventures he discovers that the only way he can truly be a revolutionary is to join up with one of the militant groups... There, he's over his head...In sharp contrast to Walt Disney's soft characters, Fritz is seen providing a bunch of screaming female cats, placing drugs, and having lots of fun... We are taken through Harlem where, in this case, the blacks are portrayed as jive-talking crows... Fritz is not a fantasy, but an animation venture into super-reality, at least as Bakshi sees it...The animation is unpolished, graceless, but very effective... It has an unrefined or unfinished, renewable energy that brings out some of the social results of the confused sixties..."
5,Kumon Director - Educator,"Excellent stapler that never jams and is quiet so stapling during a quiet class in not disruptive. We love your staplers! (Shipping was quick and Amazon, as always, is the best.)"
4,Comanche Moon,"This is an easy read in a period we can only imagine. The story develops pretty much as it would have to, and characters nicely nurtured throughout story. I shared this with a friend who enjoys a lusty read now and then and my friend was very happy happy with it!"
1,Comanche Moon,Not impressed at all with the writing. It's plot was boring and I became disinterested a short way into the book.
4,What's Not to Like - Amanda is in a Bikini the Whole Time,"Amanda Bynes is easily one of the most talented comedian actresses today - she rises above the most pedestrian plots and writing - giving it her all and finding laughs where the material is mostly cliched. Yes, you can pretty much guess where the movie is going but she makes it all fun - and she's in a bikini practically the entire movie - what's not to like about this film?"
4,Love Wrecked,"I usually don't like chick flicks but I liked this movie.I liked the story of how Amanda Byne's charcter is stranded on an island with with her pop star crush,or so he is lead to believe.The movie has a lot of funny parts.The location and scenery is beautiful and Carlton from Fresh Prince Of Bel Air is in it!This is a sweet and innocent movie.I think people of any age would enjoy this movie,not just teens.I'm in my 30's and I liked it."
4,Lovewrecked,"LovewreckedIf you like Amanda Bynes, you will love this movie. You may have seen this plot line many times before but Amanda makes it worth watching again. Get Lovewrecked with Amanda, no rescue needed."
4,good chick flick,I purchased this for my teenage neice she loved it. I have not had the chance to watch it with her yet. She gave it a thumbs up.
2,Teen Flick - Great Resort,"I bought the movie primarily to see the Sun Village Resort in Cofrezi, DR, where the film was shot. We're planning a vacation there and wanted to see some of the area ""live"" and there are lots of scenes showing the resort facilities. The movie, itself, would probably only be of interest to teens and Amanda Bynes fans."
4,Lovewrecked a good time for all,This is a movie to see for a good time.Watch it with the gang for everyone to have fun.Its great entertainment watching the leagths Amanda Bynes goes to to keep him from finding out their only 2 miles from the hotel.The extras are lacking on this dvd.I think standard extras on all dvd releases should be min blooper reel and deleted scenes.This movie was orignal set to be released in theaters in 2005 with apg-13 rating.The distribution to theaters fell apart for some reason.Then in 2007 it was recut to pg and released as a tv movie.(USA abcfamily) It also aired on tv in Germany still pg ver(German 14).The pg 13 ver has never been released and is not avalable anywhere at the moment.Ten minutes of scenes were cut for the pg 13 ver.
2,Below average romantic teen flick,"""Lovewrecked"" establishes its premise pretty early on and then goes on and on and on and even at a shade over 80 minutes feels like it goes on forever. Bynes is appealing but she doesn't have a lot to work with here."
2,Amanda Only,"You gotta really love AB,Which I do... But even for me, It was hard to watch,Lousy story = lousy movie.Makes me want to watch ""SHE'S THE MAN"" for the 37th time."
4,Amanda Bynes Is Silly,"I bought this movie because I like Amanda Bynes, and she delivers with her patented goofiness trademarked by her Amanda Show days. But it's confusing who is the leading man in this movie. The guy she falls for is a rock star, but the guy who likes her is the guy from the Mean Girls movie who Lindsay Lohan falls for. So it seem weird that the Mean Girls guy can't seemed to get attention from Amanda. Jamie-Lynn Sigler plays a role in movie, but having the girl from Sopranos in the movie didn't seem to fit. Amanda and Jamie-Lynn fight over the rock star. I personally don't think Jamie-Lynn is young enough to fall for rock stars, like New Kids On The Block type of mania. But Amanda plays well the rabid fan."
1,Fell Apart!,"DO NOT BUY!! I am SO disappointed in this product. Everyone was thrilled at first. My son loved it and we loved it too. I love that it was wood and it looked like it was very sturdy. After a month of play, small wooden pieces that were covering the screws fell off. That was a problem with my teething daughter crawling around, so we pulled the rest off and continued to let my son play. Since then, the rope has unraveled and broken and now the main pieces are detaching from one another after only a few months of use. Terribly disappointed-- this was a very expensive toy and my son is now without a crane."
5,My son gets mad at me...cause I'm playing with this thing all the time,I bought 3 different guidecraft toys for my son and they are all awesome. This crane is huge and very interactive. I highly recommend any of the toys in this line.
3,OK...but not great,This heater is only OK. Mine broke within 2 months and I had to jump through hoops to get it fix through the warranty. Even before that though I didn't think the heater really pushed out a whole lot of heat. I think there are better one's on the market if you look and probably a much cheaper price also.
2,"Worked great for exactly one year, then died.","This heater worked very well supplementing household heat for a fairly large (12 x 16) and chilly basement room. Then about two days after the warranty expired - the heater expired as well. First it emitted an ugly smell indicating some malfunction. After turning it off for a while it would not come back on. If it cost around $30, I would probably buy another one, but it is not worth $60+."
1,Very bad investment,"I was excited reading all the review this heater got. Whe I received the item, I was not able to use it since I have the central heating of the house on for November & December. I now moved to a smaller place and try to use it for my bedroom. This heater is not even warm enough to warm my feet! I am trying to find the place to have it returned or fixed; but Delonghi is not based here, I think."
1,"This ""heater"" doesn't blow hot air!","This heater sure ""blows""...luke warm air, that is.If it is turned up to the hottest temperature (94 degrees), it is not even warm enough to warm up my hands - even if I hold them right in front of the fan.Don't waste your money.It's too bad I threw away the box before I ever plugged it in - otherwise, I would've sent it back!"
4,"Pretty good, though somewhat repetative...","I looked at an older review, and on my computer, this CD is not copy protected, probably because my system is only a few months old.This CD is pretty good overall, but has alot of remixes, and it gets annoying hearing the same song over and over again in different styles. It's great for a huge Darude fan!"
4,I can feel the beat !,"The album is great with the exception of the remixes, but they are at then end and you dont have to listen to them unless of course you use random play. Burning, Feel the Beat and Flow are the best tracks by far i think, mainly because i killed Sandstorm early on. Some tracks use the same formula but which artist doesn't.. I reckon this formula works for Darude, besides without vocals, variation is difficult. [on the other hand the out of control vocal mix is terrible - thank darude its not on the album.. the album is great :)]. The high point of the album is the BASS !!! if you luv bass and high synthesizer sounds get this :) If you dont like the high synthesizer sounds as such, get Rush, which has less of em and is overall more down beat. One less star ONLY for the remixes. [we buy the single if we want remixes]"
3,"same ole, same ole...","Darude is pretty new and seems to get a lot of air time with his new hit ""Sandstorm""...while I love that track just as much as any other electric junkie, don't let that one track be the reason for you buying the CD. When I heard it, I jumped to buy the CD and have regretted it. All the tracks sound exactly the same as the next and they are all pretty much old. If you listen to a lot of techno and trance like me or hit the clubs a lot, you'll find that you've heard many of those tracks 10000 times. Most of the tracks are remixes anyways, nothing really new. Before you go to get this CD, I encourage you to check out DJ Baby Anne, who has a new mix CD out, or maybe even DJ Icey. Don't get me wrong, Darude's CD is good mixing and pretty nice for a newbie, but it's nothing original. I give it 3 stars."
2,this record repeats...,"For anyone who tuned into the radio stations in 2001, I'm sure youve heard the euro hit ' feel the beat' and 'sandstorm' While these are both good tracks, the rest of the cd is lacking and repetitive. Honestly, its as if the v man has remixed the entire cd after its previous track. The vocals arent great, and the cd is an alltogether sloppy effort, lacking structure. However, there is supposedly a 'hidden track' if you play your tracks in a specific order, but i never got it to work. In sum, your 14.95 would be better spent on a variety of other cd's. If youre a TRUE trance fan, this is a sellout item, put it back on the shelf and move on to something more true to the style."
1,apparently...,"all the five stars were from people who have little to no knowledge of Electronic Dance Music.darude is, essentially, talentless. his record presents nothing but one tired knockoff after another of ""sandstorm"", which did nothing but capatalize on the cheese factor that's given trance a bad name while making it commercially swallowable for the pop-music masses.yeah, buy it...then, when you're ready for real dance music, come back and start with sasha's global underground SF or some paul van dyk."
5,cd order,"I recieved my order within a couple of days. It was delivered as promised, in wrapper and all. I love the CD too. Great service will order again."
3,Eh....it's alright...I suppose...,"I bought this cd for two reasons: the first being because I loved the song Sandstorm. The second reason, it sounded good cruising around in my friend's car.I listened to the entire cd once, and that was it. Now when I listen to it, I just go for the two tracks I like. Sandstorm is the first, and I used to enjoy it a lot more before it got massive airplay. The other track I enjoy is the third one (not sure of the name, but I think it's Feel the Beat). I just like the part near the end where it transitions into a slower song. I love listening to that part while I'm driving, makes me feel like I'm cool or something, lol.I'd have to say this is a good cd for cruising around with a car full of friends to get you all hyped up. But for anything else? Na..."
2,Eh....Okay,"I bought this cd for my love of ""Feel The Beat"" and ""Burning"" hoping to find a cd with songs like this. Only those two and ""Sandstorm"" are good. The rest are long, boring, and repetitive. Only one or two has vocals other than ""Feel The Beat"" and ""Out Of Control"" and even then tehy are just repeated words. Plus, there is 9 songs and 6 remixes. Tell me he put effort into this cd."
4,The Title Speaks Volumes,"Everyone has heard Sandstorm; to be honest, that song is the reason I bought the album. However, once I got it, I was amazed at the other tracks. Never before have I listened to an album whose title fit the mood of the songs perfectly. Tracks four through six all build and the overall mood is in fact a calm before the storm. Track seven has the most excellent ""reverse bass"" sound (where they sampled a bass beat, then played it backwards). Better yet, the album is as dance floor friendly (as seen by the club play Sandstorm and Feel the Beat have seen) as it is down-tempo-ear-drum-friendly listening. Definitely a good buy."
4,DARUDE (THE BOMBI'N DJ ROOKIE),"This cd has everything you need to dance. it's got long beats so you can't stop, a perfect gift for dance lovers. 11 songs...1 hour of great nonstop jams! i recommend this to loud music lovers!"
5,One of the best Trance albums ever!,"This trance CD is absolutely excellent. It is up there with the greatest artists- Ferry Corsten, Fragma and Paul Oakenfold. I suspect that very soon this artist will get very popular in America, and if he doesn't that's a shame. If you like trance you should buy this CD whenever possible. It sounds like a combination between Storm and one of the mega-popular artists such as Oakenfold if you know trance. It does not cost too much now that it has been released in the States and you should definitely buy it."
5,in short? a must-buy,"Ok, I'll say it. $20+ is a lot for a CD. But if you've heard any of it, you'll gladly pay it. This is easily one of the best CDs I think I've ever bought. From the popular synthesizer beats of ""Sandstorm"" and ""Feel the Beat"" to the fast lyrical assault of ""The Flow"", this CD is non-stop party material. If it isn't already, it should be a staple for MCs and DJs. I would reccommend this CD to just about anyone.In short? AWESOME."
3,Darude: before the storm,"before the storm is a good example of the fusion of trance and hard house. Unfourtuantly, while darudes singles ""sandstorm"" and ""feel the beat"" are great singles, as so often happens, the album fails to be that succesful, in that the sense that many of the songs after listening to the album for a while end up sounding the same (kind of like Alice Deejay and ATB). Before the storm would be a good album to buy if you are new to dance music and want something that is prehaps more easily accesible than other stuff out there, but to a person like me who is deeply into the dance scene, Before the storm is an album that you can do with out, since it is obviously a commercial album, aimed at the mass market. Oh yeah, to a certain reviewer, Darude is NOT techno!."
4,"Darude ""Before the Storm"" Audio CD review","If you are a fan of trance music, you will like this album. If you like hard beats against a hypnotic background, vibrating with melodies and sounds, you will like this album.Darude's ""Before the Storm"" includes the worldwide favorite, 'Sandstorm', often played at sports events, and even featured on DDRMAX, the video game.If you do not like extremely repetitive music, you may not like this album. Although most of the songs repeat melodies and sounds, Darude's music stirs excitement in the listener. It's great for workouts, dances, running, or even background music."
3,Before the Storm,The CD is great but it is not the one advertised with all the sandstorm remixes.... the version that they sent me only had 10 tracks and not 15. Before ordering make sure it is the full length album
3,Too much!,"You know, the first time I heard Sandstorm, I was in awe. Then, after the gazillionth time I heard it, I wanted to strangle myself. I love trance, and this cd is pretty good. There are too many remixes of the same songs on the same cd though, and it is waaayyy overplayed. I think he did a good job, but he's no mastermind. My recommendation? Download the cd and only listen to it once in a while, or in the middle of a big mix of songs...don't buy it."
5,The debut album of this great artist from Finland rocks!,Sandstorm is not the only good song in this album. Feel the BsT. pAUeat and Before the Storm are also great!
3,"Sandstorm's great, but the rest...","I bought this cd when I was traveling in Europe and it had just come out and was huge. People had ""Sandstorm"" for their cell phone ring for christs sake. I loved the song and ended up getting the cd on the Estonian black market. But I must admit that though the first track may be the one-hit-wonder the rest sounds all too similar for my tastes. I enjoy a hefty helping of techno and dance type music but listening to a few tracks one cant help but think they all sound way way to similar. Buy it for the first and second songs, after that I wouldn't say its as great as those raving europeans say =]"
4,Spin the globe!,"For some earlier singles by this Finnish ravester, check out the double CD ""Cyber DJ in the Mix"" that features Darude along with the best of global dance, from Paul van Dyk to Groove Coverage to Baracuda!"
2,Darude can do so much better,"IMHO, this is a very disappointing CD. Darude could have done so much better. The only songs that are notable on this album are the overplayed ""Feel The Beat"" and ""Sandstorm."" I really don't think that it was necessary to include all those remixes on ""Before The Storm"" since those two songs are great as it is. It really devalues this CD and makes you wonder if he has any talent for making catchy trance songs. (I know he does.)Another thing that troubled me about this CD is that most of the songs sound alike. I know tranceheads really enjoy this, but I, for one, can't stand it. Once again, you really start to question his musical abilities. Overall, two stars: one for ""Feel The Beat"" and one for ""Sandstorm."""
1,Poor re-records and live tracks,"'This budget-priced Willie Nelson compilation from Ultimate Music Collection boasts some classic Willie tunes like ""Home Is Where You're Happy,"" ""Half a Man"" and the ""Last Letter,"" but at 16 tracks, it's merely a bite from a cake that's put out far better slices. Try Columbia's Essential Willie Nelson instead.'This is straight from [...] and they're being kind.The worst Willie album I own, the volume will go soft/loud for no reason other than technical. The recording all sound thin and tinny and seems to hide any real extended frequency. The song 'I Didn't Sleep a Wink', glad this wasn't the first Nelson song I had ever heard...it would of been the last if had.Save your money..."
5,Great Deal,"I'm a brand loyalty type of guy and that is why I chose Lucas, as well as they provide a proven heavy duty service product which is what I need. I can say that Amazon has the best price as well as a larger variety of products and portion sizes that I could find in any of my local auto parts stores. I can also say that the shipping was quick, like 3 or 4 days, and that it was securily packed. All in all, mission accomplished."

4,best book on programming FEM available in the literature,"This book assumes that the reader already knows thetheory behind the finite element method.The explanations of the code are limited, but with carefulstudy, the code is powerfull,concise and portable. This is by farthe best book available in the open literature forprogramming the finite element method. The reader withbackground in FEM theory, will find this book extremelyuseful, and the code very readable."
3,"Incomplete, what a pity....","I hoped to get complete sources for all the examples and programs in the book, but alas...Just the routines I wanted to use were missing: lancz1 and lancz2 were omitted.Probably because of copyright issues.To be complete you need the (commercial) HSL library and it is not included.The authors should really include a work-around, maybe write their own Lanczos algorithm...Very annoying, when you finally have found the routines you want to use in your own software, you find out a routine is missing.The downloadable sources and all the listings in the book suggest completeness... but no..."
3,A good introductory book for FEM programming,"I must say I agree with the views of `A reader from Seattle', and moreover, I must point out that in such a book one most definitely expects discussion of the optimum way to program the object oriented FEM using Fortran 9x. Instead, the authors only claim that introduction of OO concepts to FEM coding using Fortran 9x is a `matter of taste', which is unlikely to be true, since there are so many publications that emphasize the virtues of such an approach. Considering the fact that Fortran 9x is not fully OO for a number of reasons and thus obviously the C++ versions of FEM codes cannot be directly converted to Fortran 9x, this would have been a most welcome contribution. I have learned that a new edition of the book is due this summer, and I hope that they address this point as well in that edition."
1,Working---so far,Purchased this to replace a failed unit that failed after approx 6 months in service. Company and dealer would not stand behind their product. I'm am stuck using their product because the rough in wiring was done for their product. You don't have to be stuck with this junk. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY
3,Very good.,"I have read just about everything from Joan Didion. This book was very good, but if you are a Didion fan, and or a Dunne fan, read her book year of magical thinking. It's the story of her husband's and daughter's tragic end and how she copes. Brilliant."
1,Short lifetime,"I bought about 10 of these, and they get gradually dimmer until after a year or so they are not useful. GreenLite replaced them at first, but the replacements did the same thing, and now they are refusing to replace them. I do not advise buying these, and I am suspect of other GreenLite products as well, based on how they treated me.See for yourself in the customer images.I'm trying the Meridian brand, which are 4 for $5 at Wal-mart."
2,Lue Calendar,"Nice looking guy, but no nudity, and all the pictures are of him. This wasn't stated in the sales literature....was expecting maybe many guys, with the photographer's name being Lue. They were unclear."
4,Great stuff,"I love Balcanian music, and I also appreciate this album so much because it is a creation of a very young person."
4,Fantastic music,"Some may call it art music, I call it amazing. The fact that this is the debut album is incredible, and I challenge anyone to find a so-called ""art musician"" that can top it. Fleet Foxes wish they had this kind of talent, and yet Beirut continues to fly (perhaps purposefully) under the radio, both literally and figuratively."
2,Don't understand the hype,While I admit it is an interesting concept to incorporate this brass style music with an indie/rufus wainwright twist. One can't help but be bored to sleep with the same sound over and over. An ambitious undertaking yes... but unfortunately Neutral Milk Hotel was way more eclectic with the use of the brass and DID NOT OVERUSE it like beirut does. Every time I put this on I feel like I'm part of some international parade looking for a way out
2,Nice sound... but it's not balkan,"Beirut certainly has a pretty sound... but it lacks the aggressiveness that is characteristic of a Balkan brass band. The music is laid back and lazy. And while the band seems to consist of talented musicians, Condus' trumpet isn't anything special. I don't understand why this band has become popular.The band, for whatever reason, plays Balkan music but names themselves after a Middle Eastern city. There sound doesn't really describe, in my opinion, the sound which makes these regions so great.I've even heard this band compared to the Janissary-Turkish sound, but I don't hear that either.I would stay away from this album if your looking for authentic Balkan-gypsy folk music... or anything that sounds like it has spirit."
1,Ugly,"Admittedly, I'm not a music expert. But I know what I like, and this is not it. It's about as ugly as music can get. Didn't enjoy it at all."
5,An amazing debut album!,"Finding out about Beirut was one of the best things to happen to me (musically) in 2007. When I first heard their EP ""Lon Gisland"", I quickly proceeded to dig back in the past works by this fascinating act.Beirut blends a lo-fi sound not unlike a group of East European gipsies with a folk feel like Sufjan Stevens with leader Zach Condon's voice coming across much like David Byrne. The result is an exquisite and upbeat album that makes your heart pound with excitement making you want to jump, clap and laugh, with ""Postcards From Italy"" being one of the highlights.Thinking that this was Beirut's debut album just blows me away. If you like it, by all means pick up ""Lon Gisland""."
4,"loose, good and quite bohemian","While it is a great CD I would also recommend Boris Kovac's Last Balkan Tango for more of the lovely Eastern/Southern European melancholia. I am amazed how Beirut manages at moments to outplay Kovac, a music veteran with twenty years of experience in New/""World"" music. That right there is a great achievment for a 19-year old kid. Oh, yes, if you can grab somewhere UNMIK Titanic, a latest documentary by Boris Mitic which opens with a mournful, but yet comedic gypsy brass cover of ""My Heart Will Go On"" you will be closer to understanding what the H-E-C-K the Balkans is all about."
3,Authentic introduction,The debut release captures Condon's particular gyp-die style more convincingly when the production and vocal work are not tuned up so much.
5,Beautiful Beirut,"Ovo je album koji obara na prvo slusanje. Nesto najbolje sto se desilo u 2006 pored albuma Rabbit Fur Coat. Amerikanac koji je inspirisan Balkanom, album nastao u Mexicu, a on nastupa pod imenom Beirut... :)Odlicno i uvrnuto!Najbolje novo ime na muzickoj sceni!"
3,Eh.,"Bloggers have been hyping this thing for a while, so I bought it, but found it to be more or less a standard indie attempt at complex instrumentation. It's interesting, but it's nothing special."
1,Low quality,The prcessing of order and shipment was good. But the working condition of the battery is poor. The Standby time is just 36 hrs and talk time less than an hour
4,just what the doc didnt order...,"Its worth every penny, I installed it in my laptop.... oops I mean tower,I thought I orderd,a laptop HD but got a tower HD even though I looked up ""laptop HD"" it was there the only 80gig and for the price I took it. Now im using it as a back up HD to my laptop. The unit it self rocks im happy."
4,Get rid of ugly cable syndrome - 12 step program,"Well, perhaps only a few steps. But, first you have to buy an expensive item (minus one star). Once over the sticker shock, and after a couple of installation steps, the device works as advertised. Outstanding! I use it in the laboratory to control equipment at a distance. That way, I can remotely control equipment in a refrigerator without freezing my bippy."
3,Ain't No Machine Gonna Beat This Railroad Man!,"This was not a very good book storywise. It was an amalgam of different John Henry stories with a bit of modern reference thrown in (jacuzzi's) for what reason I can not fathom. The artwork is what makes this book interesting and would make a great picture book if the publisher's would just get rid of the written story. Get this book for your pre-readers and tell the story your own way or better yet, let them tell you a story."
2,jacuzzis and rainbows?,"The John Henry I remember from my childhood was strong, honorable and could outwork any 20 other men. He would not have ""added a wing onto the house (his parent's house)with an indoor swimming pool and jacuzzi"". The text flowed somewhat awkwardly in spots - I assume there's some John Henry song that I haven't heard that perhaps would make it more lyrical. I feel that adding details that do not fit in historical context detract from the story itself. Adding random rainbows also did nothing to add to the story, for my part. Strangely sappy and a poor tribute to the original legend. Good illustrations."
4,The Strong and Brave John Henry,"John Henry was born as a normal baby, but when he began to grow he grew very big and very fast.He grew and grew untill one day his head and shoulders grew out of the roof that was over the poarch.That next morning he helped his father re-build the poarch that he had ruined. Anything anyone neededhelp with John Henry was willing and ready to help. He was very big and strong and believed that he could fixanything or any problem anyone had. There was no one who could beat John Henry, but many tried. Hethrough many differnt battles agains people and objects through out the story, but the one that reallygets him in the end is the battle agains the machine to cut and grind through the moutain. HeHe hammers faster and faster and tries so hard untill he cant take it anymore and he dies in the endThe people understand that dying isnt what matters its what do you and how well you liveyour life ."
3,So-so,"My 5 year old was only half interested in this book. I think the story was a bit long, and the wording did not flow well. The drawings were nice, but I think they appealed to me more than my son."
3,Sora shifters are hard to reach,"The bike is perfect, except for the shifters. I have regular size hand and find shifting with the sora shifters somewhat difficult (though it is getting better with time).The rear hub is not quick release (despite the Amazon description saying so) - not a big deal (actually it makes adjusting the hub easier)The spokes on the front wheel and the rear wheel use diferent wrench size (#0 and #2)."
2,Buyer beware!,The only component that is Shimano on the bike I recieved is the front derallieur. The crankset has no name. The rear derailleur is some cheap brand called micro shift. Assembling and calibrating front and rear derailleurs were not my cup of tea. I had to true my rims cause they were like frys. I called GMC and Ms. Swan from Mad t.v. answered i told her about the components not being Shimano. She said sorry it depends on the time of year. They don't really care. GMC should stick to what they know making cars and not bicycles.
2,Bike did not match description,"I purchased this bike (54cm) in Feb. 2009. It came 5 days after the purchase and the shifters, rear derailleur, and crankset components were MicroShift instead of Shimano/Suntour."
4,Good Value for the Money,"This bike was a replacement for a $600 bike my son purchased and later damaged beyond repair. He likes it just about as well, the major difference is the Yukon has 14 speeds vs. 21 on his previous bike. My neighbor who knows much more about bikes also thought it was a good value. I liked the free shipping and not having to shop at WalMart."
1,Tons of Flat Tire with horrible rim design,"Riding over 1000 miles in 10 months, it result in 10 patches in rear tube and 4 patches in the front even though I used rim tap to replace original rubber strip based on previous buyer's recommendation. So, you must either take patch kit and portable pump for flat tire or have cell phone to call someone pickup you and bike if you are ready to ride over 5 miles away. Obviously, rim deign has critical defects because any intermediate impact may cause broken tube. BTW, I'm 5'10"" and 150 pounds, not big guy for sure.Not recommend to buy this bike."
5,Super starter road bike,"This is a super value for a starter bike. I'm just getting back into riding after a 20 year lay off. I looked around and couldn't find a road bike at a LBS for under $600. I really wasn't sure if I wanted to spend that much. I found this bike on Amazon and was a little unsure about it until I rode it. This is a great bike for someone like me ( a novice in his 50's). It was easy to assemble and after riding it all doubts disappeared. The only suggestions I have is to get a bike computer, gloves,helmet and a more confortable seat."
2,I love it - I Hate it,"When I began using this cleaner I was very impressed with it's cleaning and ease of use. Unfortunatly within an hour, the belt broke (they shipped a replacement belt with the machine). After replacing the belt, it ran great for about 30 min. then the brush arm literally melted and rendered the machine unusable, requiring service. Now I have to deal with the hassle of replacing the part and can only hope the new part(s) will somehow not fail as well."
1,Garbage,"This thing doesn't even deserve to call itself a steam cleaner, cause it makes no steam! This thing is pretty close to worthless, I have cleaned things with it but it's a painful and arduous process to do so. The best this thing really could be considered is a wetvacuum because it produces no heat of its own. Filling up the bucket is a pain, having to use a separate spray bottle because the builtin spraying mechanism cuts out intermittently and it just gets things too wet to be anywhere near effective. Not to mention the suction on it is fairly poor and I've only used this thing about 5 times total! I hate this thing! If you want a steam cleaner, get something else, this thing is NOT worth anywhere NEAR $250.. Maybe $30.."
1,worst cd i ever bought.its worthless horrible remix,i did not know its a remix.sound like static in the cd scratchy horrible sounds. do not buy. i love cherrele but this is horrible.only good thing is the picture on the cover
1,"PURE GENERIC, BLAND R&B","I've been a Cherrelle fan since her ""High Priority"" album in the mid 80's. What happened? The cheesy ""intro"" is a perfect introduction to the garbage on this cd. (Why even bother to use it again as an ""outro""?) Nothing on here is even remotely catchy. ""Saturday Love"" was a great song. It's sad to hear such a horrible remix on this album. Cherrelle deserves so much better. I just hope ""The Right Time"" comes where she could reunite with Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. In my opinion, her albums with them were the best."
2,Not what I wanted,"For a short summary, read the last paragraph.I've always liked ""Saturday Love"", and I tried twice before to order a Cherrelle CD that had it, but it was always unavailable. When I saw that this CD shipped in 2-3 days, I ordered immediately. WHAT AN IDIOT! I didn't take the time to read the reviews, so I had no idea that this was a remix. This CD is absolutely worthless to me. I can't remember the last time I was this mad about buying a CD.In all honesty, this CD would probably be good if I wasn't so bloody mad. Holy mole, does it have bass! You can FEEL this CD vibrating in your chest. It's not so bad, but I'll never listen to it again. It's just not something I want to spend my time listening to when I've got so many better CDs. This is R&B. Not Soul.This review is mainly a warning to others like me. ""The Right Time"" does NOT contain the popular (radio) version of ""Saturday Love."""
2,your time is up,"this album is just stanknasty. I was listening to it while working out and kept skipping over songs half way through. Girlfriend, you lost your edge on this album. Maybe you need to get back with jimmy jam and terry lewis.Just because you are showing everybody your new ""headlights"" on the front cover doesnt mean they will buy your music!"
2,Come on homegirl!!!,"Wow....what a waste!!! This power voice has not even been tapped yet in my humble opinion.If anyone has a question on this...please listen to the single ""Never in my Life"" from ""The Woman I Am"" CD...and you will understand why I was so disappointed when this ""weak"" CD was released back in 99...I was hoping for so much more...and I know she can give so much more!!!Maybe a good producer will come along and embrace Ms. Cherrelle the way she deserves to be...i wish her the best!!!"
3,"It was ok, somewhat catchy","I too miss the fire of Cherrelle that she had in her albums, ""High Priority. and Affair"". I like the woman I am album also because it shows that Cherrelle can be Jazzy and sophisticated. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis need to hook her up again to bring her back into the spotlight."
5,"Diva,Diva,Diva !","Cherrelle's new album is great , the intro ,interlude and outro are excellent, and her songs are beautiful,""Don't, ""Just Tell me "" and ""Stop loving you ' are the bomb ! she looks great on her new video ""JUST TELL ME"" ! CHERRELLE KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK ! and I think ""affair"" and this album 'THE RIGHT TIME "" ARE HER BEST FORMS OF WORK !"
3,The size is actually very small,"3 stars.The material is good, and the gloves seem to be durable and of high quality overall, but the description is wrong: it's not ""large"". If this size is *large*, then their *small* size will fit only a little kid."
1,Does not last!!!,"They work but only if you don't mind shelling out money for a new pair every 2-3 months. I must have bought at least 4 pairs of these gloves and it all fall apart pretty soon. Starting with the finger tips. Feels like a rip off if you are expected to buy 4+ pairs of gloves every year for normal usage (washing dishes twice a day).Come on, how hard is it build gloves which last at least 6 months?"
3,Lasted about a month,I used these gloves twice a day to wash dishes . The fingertip of the glove developed a puncture after about a month of use. The interior of the gloves felt comfortable on my skin. As previous reviewers have mentioned the large gloves fit too tight and are difficult to remove. I will probably not purchase a new pair since these gloves are not that cheap and too expensive to replace monthly.
2,Rubber gloves,"I was disappointed in these much to narrow at the wrist, very difficult to take off and put on !"
3,Casabella Gloves,"These gloves are good but, I would like a little more insulation inside them. Just to give a bit more protection to my hands while they are under the hot water."
1,Ripped,"I bought these because they are advertised as being high quality but they it was to my disappointment that they got a small one 1"" rip in them which makes it unusable because it doesn't protect you from the water and soap and when it gets in, it stays in."
5,Makes dishwashing fun!,I love the pink color and the little cuffs and the fact that my nails are protected while I do dishes.
1,Not as good as Wells Lamont gloves,I bought these because my trusty blue gloves were not in stock at Lowes. With all of the great reviews I thought there would be no way they could fail. I'm not happy with them. They are extremely tight (I bought a large and there is no extra large). They are also not insulated. The Wells Lamont gloves I was replacing have a thin liner which keeps your hands just far enough from the surface so you can use super hot water when cleaning.I'm going to keep my eyes open for a pair of those blue gloves when I head out to the store next time.
4,"High quality, a little smelly","So.... not much to review with a pair of kitchen/cleaning gloves. Here is what I have to offer.Size - they look to be pretty well matched to unisex US sizing, the Large size are true.Material Quality - They seem to be very high quality, they are relativly heavy but not soo heavy that they restict your movement/grip, the inner liner is comfortable, the outter layer with textured grippy surfaces on the palms and fingers is perfect and its easy to get a grip on soapy dishes.Now the only thing I thought was a little weird, myh pair had a semi-strong vanilla-ish scent that I guess was intended to cover the odor of any rubber/latex in the gloves, I may be overly sensitive to it, but the smell is a little strong which really doesn't matter when they are in use becuase even dish soap easily overcomes it, for some reason it is just a little weird smelling to me though.I'd definitely buy again though, the little odd odor and not entirely unpleasant wasn't that offputting."
1,"Crochet Rugs and Throws...unimaginative, boring","I found this book unimaginative and an overall disappointment. There were basically only a couple of designs in the book, and every design seemed to be a re-hash of the others. Unlike most good knitting books (where one can spend a lot of time perusing and enjoying the ideas and patterns), I flipped through this book in less than five minutes and had no interest in looking at it again."
5,Great resource,not only is this a complete guide -- but it is so easy to use -- anyone owning or buying Hummel's should have this -- I only wish I could find Guides like this for my other collectables --
5,Most complete information for new collector of Hummels,I inherited several figurines and knew very little about Hummels. I was able to decipher the marks on the bottom of each piece to determine the type and value of my collection. It has complete information yet easy to understand to the beginner and a valuable tool for collecting Hummels.
3,Oreck beats it,"This vacuum cleaner is okay-- I liked the idea of a bagless, but when I tried the bissell next to my Oreck, on my pet-hair covered carpet, my old Oreck picked up every bit of it. The bissell left streaks and had to be gone over several times to come close. It has a wider sweep, however, and the brushes get much closer to the wall than Oreck's."
2,High Maintenance and messy..,"The vaccum has good suction.. I was very happy with the suction and it worked like a charm for awhile. I had to tear the thing apart several times just to remove clogs... no fun but it still worked fine. Now, only after 8 months of having the thing, the motor blew. I mean it really blew.. smoke bellowing out of the thing and all.After doing bunches of research, it seems that many vaccum manufacturers make their vaccums intentionally to only last about a year. I will now be moving to a Dyson DC07. It is the cheapest of the dysons and it has a 5 year manufacturer warranty. All I have heard is good things about customer support also. In the long run, this is a much better financial decision instead of going with cheap vaccums every year.Sorry Bissell, another unhappy customer here."
5,I can't believe how good this vacuum is -- and only [$]!,"I didn't expect much for the price, but this vacuum cleaner is excellent. At less than half the price of most uprights, it exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds. It does a superb job: Great suction, brushes that really clean the carpet, and it's even bagless!It's an absolute joy to use this machine.My carpets were so filthy, and now they're so clean! I was sure that I'd need a steam cleaner after a whole winter of tramping around -- snow, mud, etc. -- but all I needed was the Bissell vacuum cleaner.This one is a must buy!"
2,It Doesn't Last,"This vacuum worked great for about 8 months, then it just gave up. The suction doesn't pick up dirt from the heavier carpets, and the filters blow out more dust that the vacuum picks up. Not worth it. I made the mistake of buying something less expensive hoping it would work, but I won't make that mistake again."
5,The miracle vacuum!,"This vacuum is a miracle from God! I had just vacuumed Sunday (with my old Eureka) and when my new Bissell arrived Tuesday I immediately vacuumed. I couldn't believe how much dirt and dog hair my new Bissell picked up. I had to empty the dirt cup three times (and I only have a condo!). The dirt cup is so easy to remove and clean and the vacuum is pretty light (about half the weight of my old Eureka). In fact, I was so impressed I bought the same vacuum for my parents today. I would highly recommend this to anyone!"
1,BEWARE!,"We receieved this vacuum as a gift and were really impressed with it's cleaning ability the first two weeks of use...although we were disapointed with the length of the power cord, it was much shorter than our previous vacuum. As our first bagless vacuum we loved seeeing the cleaning results and emptying the canister was not too messy. However during our last use of the vacuum cleaner before returning it to Bissel, it left black burn marks on our carpet. Now we our stuck vacuumless while we shop for a new vacuum AND new carpet. BEWARE we would not recommend this product."
1,Mine died too!,"Sounds like everyone's 35755 works great for about a year, then dies. Mine also got louder after about a year, smelled like it was burning, and all but stopped sucking. Took the whole thing apart, made sure nothing was clogged, didn't find anything. The belt was fine too. But the motor was still burning hot after sitting for 15 minutes. I think Bissell used cheap electric motors in these, so they die after ~12 months. I bought this vacuum based on Amazon reviews--so here's a warning--Avoid this model!!!"
5,best i've ever used in about 40 yrs,"i was amazed at the ease of use. it practically aimed and drove itself. i broke my back 2 yrs ago and have 2 herniated lower disks so weight and ease are enormous factors. as for cleaning, i went over where i had just swept. it's not just the 'extras' that it picked up but the dirt that came from this carpet. carpet on the way to looking new(er) and it's just 4 yrs old now!!!"
5,Makes vacuuming a pleasure. Really!,"I purchased this for my mother, who wanted a bagless vacuum cleaner. She LOVES it. The dirt cup is very accessible and easy to clean. I like the BRIGHT headlights. I no longer suck up all the cat toys under furniture because I can SEE them. And if I accidently do pick up something I shouldn't have, it's SO EASY to just dump out the dirt cup on a sheet of newspaper and retrieve the item. I highly recommend it."
2,Love at first sight--hate it now,"It was great at first, but it kept breaking belts and its a pain to have to change them. If you have animals, you will clog up the filters continually with hair. Had it 5 months and the engine just stopped----took it apart and wiggled a wire and it started once. I don't have time for this stuff!"
5,Shocked and Impressed!!!!!!!,"I was so shocked at how much this lightweight vacuum was sucking up, and I was really impressed with the ease of assembly and the price. This is by far the best vacuum I have ever bought, and I am recommending it to all my friends and family. It's also very easy to handle, unusally quiet, and lightweight. The feature I like the most is that the filters can be washed unlike the filters on more expensive vacuums, and that it is bagless and easy to empty without dust flying everywhere. It's truly the best buy for your money if you are looking for a quiet, bagless, upright vacuum that is reasonably priced."
2,Not what I'd hoped,"I love my Bissell carpet steam cleaners and was excited to get a bagless vacuum, but I'm afraid the Bissell can't stand up to the job. I've had my Bissell for less than a year, and I watch in horror every time I turn it on and a huge cloud of dust rolls out of the filter chambers. Even when I've just cleaned the filters! I have a unique situation, as I foster dogs for a rescue organization, so I have a lot of pet hair, dirt, and torn up paper! I thought the Bissell bagless would be a wonder, but it's been very disappointing. I'm just glad I didn't pay a lot of money for it (like I did with another well know brand that also couldn't take it)."
1,THE 5 MONTH VACUUM,"Mark my words, Do Not Buy this Vacuum. I have only had mine for 5 months and the darn thing is already breaking. At first, it seemed great, the suction power was wonderful. Now it sounds like it's burning up every time I use it. The sound it makes is so painful that I haven't vacuumed for a week and I have three dogs. I would have been better off spending more money for better vacuum than trying to save buying this one. Bissell, you need to stick to steam cleaners!!!"
1,Good for 6 months.....,"Then it dies. Like at least one other reviewer has commented, this vacuum is not durable. I was thrilled with it out of the box when I saw how well it cleaned. Three months later I was wondering about the quality of construction becuase it was getting wobble, the agitator was sticking, and the motor was noticeably louder. Six months later I have to buy a new vacuum because the Bissel no longer works at all. I did my best to give this thing proper maintenance (cleaning filters, removing hairs and strings from the agitator belt) but to no avail. It is RIP. I know you can buy a more durable item than this."
2,Does not last,I have had this cleaner for a year and at first it was the best one I ever had but for the last several months I have not been able to keep the hoses from getting clogged. I have cleaned the filters but very little actually makes it into the vaccuum cleaner. Every week I have to remove the hoses and pull everything I just vacuumed out to clear the hose. It will work for about one cleaning and then I get to do it again. I am setting it out for the trash collectors.
3,Static Shock,"Overall great value. Got it for [price] including free shipping and 10% off from Amazon.The bagless feature is very convenient, but I find it messy - it leaves significant amounts of debris on the vacum which can be wiped off with a wet towel. I am sure this is an inherent problem of all bagless vacum.The one compliant I have - and it's BIG - is that I find myself getting static shocked by the hose a lot. I do not understand why the plug does not have a ground (the third prong and bottom prong to the outlet) - nor do I know if this will help alleviate the problem. I wonder if Bissel is aware of this. Is anyone else experiencing this?Just be wary."
1,"KEEP YOUR MONEY, DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK","Cleaning the filters is a nightmare... I might as well buy a new filter after every time I vacuum; the entire dust bin is caked as are both the upper and lower filters. It is also an electrical disaster, every time I plug it in I am nearly electricuted, and I have to spray the machine with Static Guard just to prevent the ambent room dust, and the blow back from sticking to the outside of the machine. I actually bought this to replace my old Bissel Lift Off, because the lower motor burnt out after 8 years... my money would have been better spent replacing the motor and the floor brush. ***FYI this machine has come down to about $59 @ Wal*Mart... gee I wonder why?***"
1,VERY DISATISFIED WITH PRODUCT AND COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have not even owned my vac for a year yet,and it is the worse peice of garbage I ever bought.As far as I'm concerned I was ripped off big time.I have had problems from day one.I have written on numerous occasions and called but I am always on hold forever.My vac has been falling apart since day one.First it started with BURSTS of smoke comung out the back.Then the whole bottom fell out which i have to keep DUCT TAPING back on.And the latest is the whole handle has now fallen off.I wouldn't mind if I paid $10 or $20 dollars but $100.00????????????I have bought other cheap brands in the past and those vacs lasted me at least 6 to 8 years.Something needs to be done about this RIP_OFF process."
2,Cleanview not as expected!,"The Bissell Cleanview is my second Bissell vacuum. I bought their orignal lift off model 5+ years ago and loved it but wanted a bagless. After trying the Sears which is great on carpets but not so good on hard floors, I emailed Bissell who of course told me I would be extremely happy with the Cleanview. Well I'm not. The power cord is too short. It kicks crumbs all over hardwood/tile floors like the Sears and is difficult to push on carpets. I wish I could send it back but the box has been discarded."
1,Toy Vacuum - don't expect too much,"The Bissell does NOT come close to my Wind Tunnel. The Bissell is okay for light vacuuming jobs. It's very similar to a sweeper with respect to the power to pick up dirt. The suction on the attachment is almost non-existent. I bought it as a vacuum which I could carry down the basement stairs, on occasion, as needed. And, it is light weight... But three times the work compared to other vacuums I've owned. Literally, what would take once over with other vacuums, will take three passes with the Bissell. FYI, Hope this helps!"
3,Powerful but ....,"I am new to bissel upright vaccums and have used the Rainbow vacuum for years. This vacuum is powerful but since it grabs everything, if you are not careful, you'll be replacing its belt all the time. I forgot that these vacuums don't stop the rollers when you use the hose. I accidentally left the vacuum on the edge of my rug. Seen smoke, it sucked the edge of the rug while I was using the hose. Replaced 3 belts so far. Had this vacuum for 2 months."
2,Not quite as functional as cute...,"This laptop bag for the price was a good buy, it is cute, but not functional... It needs more space in the inner pocket, I have cute thing HP Pavilion and it barely fits... There is also no room for the power supply anywhere in the case, I also can't use it carry an external mouse... But for the price, I would buy it again."
1,Study guide for technical analysis of the financial markets,"Don't get this, it is some kind of answer book to some unknown questions. You want the other book NOT the STUDY GUIDE. I have to send this back and get the other one that is not the study guide. I'll let you know how that is."
1,Waste of time,"John Murphy is a market technician with well deserved notoriety. The textbook, Technical Analysis of Financial Markets is excellent, the workbook is garbage. Poor questions, unclear statements and vaguely annotated charts muddle the text. The textbook covers 19 plus chapters, the workbook only goes to chapter 12. Disappointing."
3,Helpful but the questions may be too simple,This book is helpful for the readers who read John Murphy's classic. But I feel the questions may be too simple. If you read the text then you can answer most of them. They are not very challanging.
2,Get the book but not the study guide.,"Let me just start by saying that the book Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets by John Murphy is an excellent book; truely a classic which I highly reccomend. However, I found the study guide to be a waste of my time. It is filled with a bunch of quizes which are vaguely worded and won't do you much if any good. I guess they can help you to see how well you comprehended the chapters, but it has no supplemental information or sumaries on important material. It's just a bunch of multiple choice and matching. There was no further understanding of the material in my experience. Save your money, just buy the textbook, not the studyguide."
1,Disapointing,"If you are going to get a book to help you restore your Ducati twin,you better pass on this one and get a good shop manual .There is litle material of use and the content is mostly a repeat of is other Ducati books .You would expect a step by step knowhow aproach with usefull imputs like the Dave Richardson Guzzilogy book for Moto-Guzzi .A good restoration book is about guiding the reader with how to hints,tips and tricks from pros that have done it many times .There are lots of photos that will show you a Ducati part with a typo description an no more ,like for example (this is what a Ducati clutch looks like +PHOTO."
2,A damp cloth probably works just as well,"This product sort of works.... we've got 2 cats and a dog and a dark brown micro-suade couch that's pretty stubborn (annoying, since we bought microsuade to avoid this problem). Anyway, this helps get the hair that's kind of embedded in the couch loose, but it doesn't really pick it up. I'm pretty sure a damp cloth is just as, if not more, effective."
1,Junk - Avoid,"This ""brush"" consists of a single piece of molded plastic with plastic cylinders as the bristles. The bristles immediately break off after any kind of use. Cheap plastic junk. Worthless. AVOID."
1,Fell apart during first use!,"This product actually did a really great job de-furing the rug I intended on using it on, however, during the initial usage it fell apart. The bristles started falling out shortly after I started cleaning the rug, about 25% of the bristles fell out during the initial usage. It is a very cheaply made product! Maybe mine was just defective?"
5,Awesomesauce,"This is the ONLY thing that's really removed the embedded SHORT dog hair on my furniture. I've tried sticky rollers, the Scotch Fur Fighter (works to a degree), hand vacs... it does take a little elbow grease, but the hair will be freed completely! Yay! What's left is little balls of fur that are easy to vacuumed up.I've never used the brush part, so no comment on that end."
4,FURemover works ok,"My cats share my bed. One long hair and the other short hair. The FURemover worked well on the bedsheets if I used a spray bottle of water to just lightly dampen the deposits first. It rolls the hair up into strings of yarn that I can just pick up and toss. It worked pretty good on my long haired cat too. But, it doesn't get down to the undercoat. So, for her, I have to use a wire pet brush first and follow it with the moistened FUR brush. The only thing that works on my short hair is my hand. Now I'd like one that attaches to a pole so that I can do my rugs."
2,Gimmick,This brush does not work as advertised! Yesterday I tried to brush hair off one of the dining room chairs and it made a mess and didnt even clean up the hair. I ended up just using my hand to remove the hair which worked much better!
3,Promising but flawed.,"Although Kenson does a fairly good job of delving into the appealing world of Shadowrun, his prose is sadly lacking. Plotwise, alright, this isn't a bad piece of work. It's a bit on the predictable side, and some of the dialogue is strained, but overall the plot's not horrible.The problem arises in Kenson's writing style. The man needs a thesaurus, and needs to embed some imagery and emotion in his works. Frankly, any author who speaks of slipping into unconsciousness as ""Then he passed out"" needs to be chained in a college-level writing workshop to learn how to write with some kind of vibrancy, appeal, and style.My opinion? Borrow it from a friend, or get it used at a sale. This one's definitely not worth full bookstore price."
2,Running Low,"Simple. That's the way he writes. Tommy Talon and his fellows (Troll sam, Orc merc, female decker, female rigger, every character a real surprise) are here again, like always needing the help of full-scale, worldwide important events to keep their story going (and the reader reading - not an easy task). Every conversation is short, simple, and archetypical. If you read SR novels to get a feeling for the SR universe, you will find nothing in THE BURNING TIME you haven't read a hundred times before. Even worse, the text on the back cover lures you into believing that there has finally come an end to Talon and company. Not quite true. Kenson tries to write good SR fiction, but it's not enough. To understand this, compare two scenes (Kenson, Crossroads, and Nigel Findley, 2XS) about a man, coming home and facing a woman threatening him with a gun. You'll see the difference."
1,This is only episodes 1-6.,"I bought this DVD in a video store. Althought the cover says the ""Complete First Season,"" it is actually only episodes 1-6 of the first season (of the George Reeves TV series). It is packaged by Warner Brothers, but they have another package out with all 26 episodes of the first season (at a much higher price). It is Warner Brothers that is misleading the public on this one."
3,Guess you have to have a wine cellar,"I bought this journal as a gift to my parents who enjoy wine but can never remember which ones they've had and how to find them again. The description states there's room to save labels - where? The pages offer a little too much detail - such as stock records (for those that have an abundance of wine on hand in their cellars). I was looking for something a bit more ""informal"" so they could jot down notes about the wine, where they bought it, where they enjoyed it and with whom, or for what occasion) and space to paste the label. This book did not fit the bill. I'll keep looking... I will say that it's sturdy for a spiral bound and appears to be well made."
2,not what I expected,"Like another reviewer stated, this book does not have room to paste wine labels. Also, most of this book is for recording cellar notes. This is not what I expected. I will keep searching for a book that has room for me to record notes on wine and a place to paste labels."
2,Get a notepad. Same Thing,"Just because it has a fancy cover does not make it functional. A yellow notepad from Office Depot works just as well. Spend your money on the wine, not this cover designed to make people who want to buy a give for a wine person think they are doing something nice."
5,The way AC/DC was meant to be heard!,"The music of AC/DC is immortalized on this, the finest bluegrass recording since ""Dueling Banjoes"". The production of this album was probably the most historically important moment in music since Elvis was deputized by Nixon, and a cultural highpoint for America. God bless Hayseed Dixie!"
5,Great Fun For The AC/DC Fans!,"For anyone not familuer with the hard rock legends AC/DC then this album would probably just seem like a normal bluesgrass album!But any AC/DC fan will be laughing at this unique tribute to the legends of rock! Hayseed Dixie have taken a few of AC/DC's classic hard rock songs, and presented them here in a blusgrass form, and what a great job they did too! Its funny to hear a hall of fame rock n roll bands music turned into bluesgrass tunes!And its no imbarrasment, even the AC/DC fans themselves enjoy this music! And Brian Johnson (singer for AC/DC) and Cliff Williams (Bass player for AC/DC) went to see Hayseed Dixie preform and loved it too! And so will you if your familuer with these songs! There not paradys or mock making songs, there just a fun tribute done in a diffrent way which is where the humour of it all takes place!"
5,Banjovi,"In Nashville, many studio session players, when not making Country records, listen to Rock. After all, it, like Country, certainly gives the guitar it's due. So, a gang of expert pickers , chillin with their favourite AC/DC tunes after hours in the studio, one night probably turned into a great time for all of them, and it shows. After i listened to it, I realized it was a cut above most parody stuff, because it was played with amazing articulation, and the vocal had a barreling presence. They kept all the good licks, and threw some great Bluegrass on top. Might be a fluke, but God, it works."
1,SACRALIDGE!,"This is terrible. I hope the boys don't hear it...Christ. This is the music I grew up on. The hillbilly gang can go blow on a jug. I only put one star because it wouldn't let me put ""-0"" I really think it is a negative like -10..."
1,Tofurkey rules!,"TOFURKEY RULES!I love tofurkey. I look forward to it every thanksgiving. True, some vegans and vegetarians don't even like it. I Love it!"
1,Nothing is better than the original,"My husband is the one who has enlightened me to the beautiful notes of ACDC and MY GOODNESS this is a slap in the face!!! I can see what they were trying to do, but oh boy, they have it all wrong. ACDC is in a class of they're own and they need no assistance. So if you love the original boys, don't even bother!!"
1,***************,"This music SUCKS. Ask your selves, Was AC/DC ment to be turned into redneck ****? Yeee haaa."
5,Use the right frame of mind,"Guys if you haven't heard yet, here is what you do...forget ever hearing AC/DC's originals.....give this a chance, if it would have come out before AC/DC's it would have went #1. These guys are good musicians, and it shows if you give them a chance, and after all it is fun and you will see that. I love, no I mean I really LOVE AC/DC's music, and this is not offensive, and wasn't intended to be. For those who have heard it and review it bad...you have to use the right frame of mind, I bet AC/DC wouldn't review it bad."
2,Hayseed Dixie,"CD is good if you only care to hear one song every so often. Same sound to every tune, artists did not vary their style of picking."
5,A real treat,Who would have thought that AC/DC could be made to sound so natural in the blue grass genre. Puts a smile on your face and keeps it there!
3,Pay Dirt Dixie,"Could lack of AC/DC tunes to draw from be cause for such a skimpy running time of 28:55 ?? I think not! These here hillbillies are more than musicians -- They're capitalists! And yes they are currently selling about 2,000 units per week.But if ever you wanted to be eased into bluegrass then this is your chance. These musicians are the real deal for they're genre. And this is much more unique than say Run DMC doing an Aerosmith tune. Nevertheless for most of us this is just a novelty CD that you can only listen to a couple of times before getting shelving it (until you wish to slip this CD in at a keg party or something). I still found myself wanting to hear the real AC/DC."
3,Why? Why Not? But Why?,"This CD was handed to me personally by Jake Daniels from Rock 100 The Katt in Oklahoma City.He and some staff members all recommended to it me, as I stood there on the sixth floor in my goofy work uniform, complete with a paper hat, name tag, and a ""Kick me"" sign stuck to my butt.I had listened to it all within the next hour, and had laughed a lot, although the musicianship is good here.""Very good"" is a hard statement, with a singer that sounds like Foghorn Leghorn, complete with a ""Boy, I say, boy"" in the version of ""TNT,"" where the backup singers chant ""Oink!"" instead of the Aussie ""Oy! Oy!""It's definitely worth at least one listen, but I'm sticking with three stars, because it will not change your life.Pat Boone's ""In a Metal Mood"" didn't save my soul, and neither did this.It's a toss-up as to which is the funnier of the two, but this one here gets the slight nod in favor of better musicianship.Cheer up, Pat. It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock and roll!"
2,One Joke Album,"This album is worth one listen for the novelty only. There isn't anything terrible about it and maybe if I weren't such a big AC/DC fan I would have enjoyed it more. I'm not a ""purist"". I don't get infuriated when someone covers one of my favorite bands, this album just isn't entertaining. The musicianship is adequete, I just don't see much appeal besides pulling it out at a party for a laugh. I can't really think of who the blue grass versions of these songs would appeal to. Judging by the rave reviews here though there is a demand for this kind of thing. I like blue grass, and I love AC/DC but I think my money would be better spent somewhere else."
3,Novel but not Reckless Kelly,"As another reviewer wrote, ""if you like bluegrass and ACDC"" you will like this. The hillbilly cover of Shook Me All Night Long is nothing compared to the rockabilly cover by Reckless Kelly on their Live at Stubbs album, which also contains a country cover of Led Zeppelins Whole Lotta Love.The advantage and disadvantage this cd has is that it is all ACDC>"
3,Yeeeee-Haaaaaaa!!,"Makes me wanna slam ""or roll"" a Bud, head-on down to the nearest Nascar track and yell out JR. WEEEE LOVE YOU!!!!"
5,Something for everyone,"I first heard of this album on the Pete McMurray show on WCKG in Chicago and really thought it sounded cool. As someone who grew up not only loving all kinds of music but also having an older brother into AC/DC really made this album a gem.You don't have to be a AC/DC fan to enjoy this music, 'cause it's honestly a lot of fun to listen to. Being a fan of the AC/DC makes it pay off a little more, of course.I mean come on; who can't enjoy the concept of ""Big Balls"" put to Bluegrass !! My only possible beef with the CD is the fact that it's so short. 30 minutes is a tad short for [the price], but if it helps get these guys back into the studio where they can work on even more tunes, I'm cool with that."
4,Thunder Down Under,"Living in Australia, home of AC/DC I Had to order the CD from the states. The week or so wait was worth it. I have brought it to work for the AC/DC fans to listen to (bieng the sole bluegrass fan). So far only one person has made an unfavourable comment (Desecration! he cried, before even listening to it).I am impressed, for ages I have been tring to get a few blokes together to play a mandolin/accordian/guitar version of 'You shook me all night long' and here it is pre packaged.Listening to this CD has given me inspiration to follow up my acoustic Jimi Hendrix ideas. Well done.The music is a bit to steady, with little variety between how tunes are sung or presented but thats the point I guess. A great CD, pity its so short for the dollars and exchange rate. Sign me up for the next CD"
4,Too funny...,"If you're an AC/DC fan and you have a sense of humor, you've GOT to hear this! Great musicianship and just too...damn...funny! I'd like to hear this band do Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band..."
5,very good,I needed something to pick up my motor wires with some style and buy these. I do not trust the plastic but I think well I enjoy seeing my engine ordered with its wires.
4,Gray Areas,"This memoir is a very interesting look into what it was like growing up for June Cross, daughter of aspiring white actress, Norma Booth, and well known black comedian, James ""Stump"" Cross. Secret Daughter delves into what is was like for a young June growing up, sometimes in two completely different worlds, and trying to find herself and more about herself and her parents. This novel takes us through June's adolescence and college years, on into adulthood and the present. June learns some lessons on her own, but is often persuaded to make choices other children or people do not have to make. Although June started out sometimes having to deny herself and even her kinships, I was happy to see that she fully accepts who she is now. I was happy June got all the answers she searched for for a lifetime, and especially the fact that she was able to reconcile her emotions with her mother and her father."
4,very good read,"this autobiographical story was very interesting, and I recommend it as an enjoyable read...well-written as well as revealing in the way interracial relationships were viewed at that time"
4,Finding one's identity,"June Cross delves into her own background and early struggles to find her identity as a biracial child growing up in an often prejudiced and hostile environment. She comes to a deeper understanding of the mother who ""gave her away"" and the difficult choices that she made."
2,Predictable and just ok,"I really wanted to like this book, but unfortunately it offers little difference to a story I've seen time and time again. It jumps around quite a bit, can be difficult to follow and quite honestly doesn't have very much substance."
3,Secret Daughter,"Being biracial I was drawn to this book. The story was different. Cross was placed with a Black family by her mother, but her mother was still in her life. What was disturbing and shocking to me was how the mother continued to treat her daughter as a second class citizen way into Cross' adulthood. I could not get past that and kept thinking why is Cross even bothering with this woman. Nonetheless the book is interesting and worth reading."
4,Secret Daughter: A Mixed-Race Daughter and the Mother Who Gave Her Away,"The book was well written and a good read. The snapshots of race relations and those involved in the Civil Rights movement were very interesting.I was surprised at the lack of anger expressed by Ms. Cross and her brother, Lary. Their mother seemed very blase about having three children out of wedlock and then giving them all away. I would think the abandoned children would harbor lasting resentment toward their mother. They are better people than most."
1,Secret Daughter an inspiration,"I found June Cross's memoir truly an inspiration. Not only does the memoir deal with the ugliness of racism but also the pain of growing up with a selfish mother. Her story is told with insight and compassion dispite events that may have made the telling impossible for most. June Cross successfully maintained a relationship with a manipulative, selfish mother without becoming bitter which may have been the key to her own success. I found her ablility to navigate her childhood without coming ""undone"" an inspiration. A great book. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a way to understand themselves."
2,Not What We Expected,"Although everyone empathized with June, we couldn't understand her loyalty. We wished she had been as loyal to Aunt Peggy. There were some readers that didn't finish because they felt the story was going nowhwere. Then you had those that finished only to be relieved that it was over. We hope that June has sought some type of professional counseling behind this, because this was not something that you just ""get over"". Having been rejected by her mother and knowing that it wasn't just her (but her white brother and sister too) should have made the blow a little easier. It's evident that June placed a barrier around herself to shield her feelings as an adult. She is a successful lady despite her past and that matters most."
1,not what expected,"I bought this book because I was interested in the content. However, I was dissapointed in the writing style, she kept changing from present and past tense. Furthermore I just couldnt get into the book and gave up about halfway through it. I would NOT recommend this book."
4,Blues Fakebook,"The book is quite good. It has the chords and the melodies. I play the fiddle, so I like having the melodies."
3,Good Songs!,"This is a large collections of blues songs. Easy to read, good arrangements. My only reservation is that it didn't contain a lot of blues tunes that are popular, or are the real classics. That may be the result of copyright issues; may be too expensive for the publisher to provide the most popular songs."
5,A dream come true... a bunch of BLUES sheet music...,I like it !Such a deal !Soooo many Blues Tunes for so little...around 6-cents a tune... Nice !The index is great... alphabetical by tune nameand another list... by artist. Very nice!I am a big Blues fan and I play a Les Paulelectric & an old banged-up 1938 May Bellacoustic 'SLIDE' (rare) guitar that i boughtfor $15 at a garage sale. A 2-inch long pieceof copper plumbing pipe for my 'SLIDE'....So Nice !Having Geezer fun.
2,Looks are deceiving,"I purchased this particular model because I was going to heat a fairly large room, so I wanted something that was going to generate sufficient heat for that purchase. The principal for the heater is to heat the oil inside which in time would provide heat for the affected room. I turned it on high (there are 3 settings) and left it on for 4 - 5 hours. There wasn't any noticeable change in room temp. Thinking the room was simply too large, I moved it to a small bedroom. On high the temp in the room went up marginally. Another thing is this would be very dangerous around children or pets. The unit gets VERY hot to the touch except for the handle in front. It has casters, and it will move quite easily, but when hot you must be very careful.While this unit looks impressive, it's not. You would be better getting a heater like the vornado that generates more heat and moves it around the room."
4,A considered and intelligent piece of writing,This is the third such guide to have been published about Guterson's novel - and easily the best. (It's a novel that I've taught since 1997.) It's not perfect but there is plenty of good material in here to get students thinking - Haytock is particularly eloqunent on Guterson's narrative technique. And she also provides the best novel/movie comparison that I've read so far.
3,not what we expected.,This was not what we expected. We thought we could use it from the cigarette lighter in the car and we can not. Not worth the shipping fee to return it.
4,good stuff,im in australia heard the mavericks on a community radio stationbought there cd and then got the dvd great music good songs anda versitile band lov em
5,The Best!!,"This is a great DVD, I think even if ur not a Mavericks fan u can enjoy this. Raul Malo is an incredible vocalist/guitarist, and eveyone else is wonderful also. I give it a 10!!!!! not a 5"
2,Not Perfect,"This phone does have easy to operate controls and easy to see number pad.My mother has no problem hearing the at her end she just adjusts the volume to suit her. However often times the party at the other end of the line gets audio distrotion or my mothers voice drops out completly. It's kind of annoying for her to have to repeat herself all the time. The operators manual says to disconnect other devices on the line like: phones, answering system, Fax units etc. and it may resolve the problem, well it dosen't, besides this is not even a reasonable request - take everything off line except the Ameriphone?? get real! This problem is consitant with every one she talks to. In spite of what others have said I'm not to impressed with this phone I expected more for my money. I do not recommend it if people at the other end can't understand you what's the point."
4,Ameriphone XL50phone,My husband can actually use this telephone and hear without his hearing aids. Prior to this telephone he wouldn't and couldn't use any of the phones in our home.
5,Ameriphone XL50,This phone was for my father-in-law who is too stubborn to get hearing aids. He is 93 years old. He says he can hear fine with it and he can see when the phone rings. He likes it.
5,VERY QUICK SHIPPING! GREAT SELLER!,"LOVE THIS PHONE. WE BOUGHT IF FOR OUR GRANDMA WHO HAD ISSUES DIALING NUMBERS. IT IS NICE TO HAVE 10 MEMORY NUMBERS ON AND THE NAME RIGHT NEXT TO THE NUMBER. CLARITY IS A GREAT PRODUCT AND WE HAD ONE MINOR ISSUE WITH THE CORD. THE HOME ACCIDENTALLY PULLED A PRONG OUT AND CAUSED THE CORD TO NO LONGER WORK, SO WE CALLED CLARITY AND THEY SENT A NEW ONE IN THE MAIL! NO CHARGE! AWESOME. WORKS AMAZING, VERY GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HARD OF HEARING. IT EVEN HAS A JACK WHERE YOU CAN PLUG A DEVICE THEY SELL SEPARATELY INTO THE PHONE AND THEN PLUG INTO A REGULAR LAMP. IT THEN FLASHES THE LIGHT ON AND OFF WHEN THE PHONE RINGS...FOR THOSE EXTREMELY HARD OF HEARING...OR PLUG IN A DEVICE THAT THEY SELL SEPARATELY THAT GOES UNDER THE MATTRESS AND WHEN THE PHONE RINGS IT VIBRATES THE BED TO GET THEIR ATTENTION. AMAZING PRODUCTS FOR THE HARD OF HEARING/SEEING..."
2,has some problems/shoddy product,"I had bought a similar version of this phone for my mother and it worked fine for her. It broke and we ordered a new one, what I believed was a better model. This particular phone has a distinct clicking in the dial tone and the clarity is poor. Adjustment of the volume seems to not work or is broken. The tone control is helpful but without the volume controller working properly it makes no difference. I have not tried to return this yet as she had had it for about a month before she told me how badly it was working. (she didnt want to complain about her gift:) I will try to contact the seller and let them know how badly this works and ask how we can either return it or have it replaced. Again, I dont know that it is the basic product that is bad or just this particular phone."
3,Not last long enough,"Out of order after purchase one and half year. Sorry, I can not give a high score, but I may have to buy another if I can not find better replacement."
4,Great Customer Service,Purchased this phone with amplifier for an elderly relative who has hearing loss. First one didn't work; called and phone was replaced immediately with one that works great.
4,Review of XL-50 digital phone,"This telephone has 4 ""modes"" which attempt to match the hearing loss curve. It also has a ""boost"" button which you can use to amplify the phone even more. There is also a red light on the phone which activates if someone is on the other line.Hookup is easy, though it does need to be plugged in. The user should play with the settings to see which ones works best. Works great on VOIP."
2,Amplification not working,Thought this would help me communicate with my aunt who wears hearing aids. It has not helped. Sound quality seems to be on her phone and she cannot understand what I am saying. Thinking of going back to old phone which does not amplify.
1,worthless junk,"Mine I got free through a VA program and should have returned it but couldn't find the paper work so I put it by the curb in a free pile. It was just horrible. I couldn't understand the other party, they couldn't hear me well and it turned out to be unusable. I would avoid this model phone.If you are wondering what I did instead, I got rid of the land line and got an iPhone with a bluetooth connection to my hearing aids that puts the phone audio directly into the hearing aids and it is wonderful."
1,Wish I had known !,"Would return the Ameriphone XL50 in a heartbeat if I could figure out how to do so. Had foolishly assumed it would work correctly - but NOT! Also foolishly had thrown away box & receipt.Very bad ""static-like"" interference. Can't seem to adjust the ""Tone"" and ""Volume"" buttons to enable my hearing. Have actually had to end phone conversations as I'm unable to understand the callers' words.Suggest cking w/ ur audiologist before paying this much $$ (which we can ill-afford) and finding one that works. This one doesn't !"
2,"If loudness is all you need, then this is for you","If loudness is all you need in a phone, then the Ameriphone XL50 would be a good choice. The first time I used it, it practically blew me out of my chair.However, if your hearing situation involves loss in word discrimination, this phone does little for that. I returned the phone because it did not improve my ability to communicate. I replaced it with a basic AT&T; phone that has no special features for the hearing impaired, and found the sound of higher quality than the Ameriphone.I am very generously giving this a two-star rating only because it delivers high volume. If a megaphone in your ear is what you need, then go for it."
2,Review of ameriphone XL50,"I received the phone from Warehouse. They said it had been returned but that there was nothing wrong with it, that it was in excellent condition.The phone worked as far as making and receiving calls, but the program function did not work, and that was really important for my mother. So, I think the phone is good, but I would not buy one from Warehouse."
5,loud ringer but not loud enough with severe hearing loss,"Update: I got the wireless lamp flasher and it works great - easy to install. One more thing, after getting the lamp flasher we discovered my mother had water in her ear. After having an ear tube inserted her hearing got better. She still uses the lamp flasher and the phone. Even though she doesn't need the loudest ring setting, the amplification is very good.I bought this for my 91 yo mother whose hearing has gone from moderate-severe hearing loss to severe hearing loss.My mother previously had an Ameriphone (Clarity) XL30 which is also a good phone.The ringer is loud - 95db and the audio volume can boost to 60db (both have tone controls), but my mom still can't hear the ringer. I don't know why - is it her hearing loss? the sound of the ring? Did I mention she doesn't wear her hearing aid? Fortunately this phone has a USB port for a wireless Clarity Lamp Flasher & Bed Shaker."
2,Great phone....while it lasted,"This is a great phone for a senior citizen, until it inexplicably stops working. Purchased this phone for an elderly family member and she actually said at times it was too loud! This is a huge improvement and made it possible for her to enjoy phone conversations again. Unfortunately, after about three months, the phone suddenly stopped working properly. None of the buttons work. For what we paid, this is ridiculous."
4,Works well but has one minus,My XL-50 phone was provided by the State of California. While the phone works well it does not provide a jack for use with a headset meaning I can't use it on conference calls where I'm often using the computer during calls. There is an audio-out jack for headphones or neck-loop but it can't be used with a headset that includes a microphone.
4,She Can Hear Me Now,"I purchased this as a gift for my Grandmother (who needs a hearing aid, but refuses to get one! ARGH). My Grandmother says the phone is easy to operate and she seems to like it. She doesn't ask me to repeat myself nearly as much as she used to. I believe this was well worth the money."
3,"Close, but design misses the mark","I purchased this for my mother who suffers hearing loss as well as macular degeneration. The amplification seems adequate (although it's maxed) and the buttons are large and easy to read. There is one major design flaw in the way users must interact with the phone however. The amplified feature (which my mother always needs), turns itself off every time a phone call ends. This means that every time she needs to use the phone (to call out or to answer) she must find the small blue button that activates the amplifier. This button is located at the bottom of the phone in the middle of a number of other buttons that are a similar size and shape. They should have allowed the amplifier to be active all the time (with optional off button), or made a button for this feature that is at least as prominent in size and location to the picture and number buttons. The phone is a nice idea but misses the mark in a key way."
4,Good product,Releativly easy to understand and adjust. Owners manual is striaght forward and simple to understandWould be nice if it had a hands free speaker.
4,A brilliant follow-up and prelude to a masterpiece,"What happened to this band?In the hey day of heavy metal music, this album came out. The ""Ultra-Violence"" was a mediocre album that did not garner much attention from the world of rock. Then came ""Frolic Throught the Park"" and the video for ""Bored."" Vocalist Osgueda clearly held this band back, but Rob Cavestany's guitar and songwriting skills shine through. Set the stage for a brilliant final album. Three and gone, just like Jane's Addiction(until now, that is)."
5,a classic that is rarely heard!,"This is some excellent thrash material - so why hasn't Death Angel been mentioned ANYWHERE??? Somebody tell me! Excluding the slightly juvenile song ""Bored,"" the lyrics seem to fit the general tone of Death Angel and thrash at the time (most metal cliches are used here - but is that a BAD thing??) and most of the songs are ... fast. My favorite track off ""Frolic Through the Park"" is probably ""Shores of Sin,"" and ""Mind Rape"" takes a close second.On their next album ""Act III,"" they pull a Metallica by going slightly softer. But by the middle of the decade they were already dead in the water (besides a few 2002 reunion shows...) so listen to a time when they were ALIVE!"
3,Okay,"This is Death Angel's second album.This album is not even close to being better than The Ultra-Violence but it is still alright.There is song's I don't like on this album like the cover of Cold Gin,that's by crapy Kiss,the song sucks.Bored is another song that sucks,but I'm not going to say what other song's suck, you decide.3rd Floor rules,Road Mutants is a good song andWhy You Do This.Shores Of Sin is the best song on the album,that song is awesome.This album has a punk style to it but it's still thrash and it's alright.Everyone has there own opinion so you decide,I don't think it's good but it doesn't suck."
1,is this the worst band ever?,i havn't heard the whole album but i heard the song bored on VH1 classic and it was one of the worst rock songs ever played by some of the worst musicians i've heaRD. THE WORST PART WAS THE GUITAR SOLO it was the worst one ever. i heard about 3 notes out of a 7 note arpeggio which is terrible. I hope this band has found another job.
1,Very Disappointing,"The author references only his own unpublished works to support his claim about the Soma plant! There is not a shred of external evidence to support his claim. His logic is awfully weak and seriously flawed -- not even worth it to itemize the details! He does not discuss or disprove other theories about Soma, nor does he tell us why his identification is better than that of others.I'm astounded that Prof. Willard Johnson could say in the jacket that it is a ""well-argued and convincing book""! After 57 pages of padded claims about the identity of soma, the rest of the book is even more padding about alchemy and western magic. This book is a major disappointment. Save your money."
3,"Interesting, informative, but...","it was a dry read. Spess's writing was very repeative. It was interesting, especially for anyone interested in the field of entheogenics, with plenty of connections drawn between Soma and it's anthropologic/historic importance to Eurasian achemical tradition. But, as mentioned in a previous review, Spess gives no reasons as to why his thesis on the identity of the plants used in the Soma ritual is any better than Wassons or that the two may be supportive of each other. If you are someone interested in Soma and entheogenics on an anthropologic level, this book is a important read though I would not recommend it as an introduction to the Soma mystery or entheogenics."
1,unique topic was disappointing,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but I found it very redundant. The author seemed to be making the same point over and over again so it became very dry and boring."
3,a.p.s,"Btw the other kids review, was written by me not johanna- i am extreamly sorry about that and any trouble it might of coused!? !-i was messing around with some friends!-:)...but i did read parts of the book since my own dad had it,since im only under 13 i didn't realy understand it but im shore people older than me will,if u do read the book i recomend u comment about it.Bye"
5,Black Water is T. J. MacGregor&#65533;s Best Book Yet,"I'm a huge fan of T. J. MacGregor's work, and I've probably read and enjoyed every book published by this Edgar Award winning author. Black Water, the new thriller involving psychic Mira Morales and her family, immediately jumped to the top of my list of all time favorite fiction. This time travel/suspense/mystery gives new meaning to the term ""page-turner""; it kept me up the half the night and away from my own work during the day. If you want a really good, exciting read, this is it. Black Water has everything: action, suspense, chills, thrills, romance, and a fascinating and provocative premise."
4,"Read, read, read!","Excellent! If you love a good mystery with some supernatural element, then you should enjoy this book!"
4,Good Book,I would have rated this book higher except that its the third book I've read on the subject and SAMs book was too good and tough act to follow. The reason I didn't think it was perfect was due the the large amount of information provided in this exam cram that wasn't even mention in the study guide. I took this test and this extra information wasn't on the test (or even in its focus); this made the book quite confusing with too many little details in one unimportant area and not enough in some other areas. The test questions were harder than the actual exam so don't let this book hurt your confidence even if you get just 50% on these questions you should be able to easily get 80% on the test. Overall this is a well written book but I felt it went off track at times (no harm done).
1,"I passed the test, but no thanks to this book.","Being someone who's been in the industry for years, I started to read this book and kept finding errors. Mainly errors that were from this book being written with the Windows 98 Beta in mind. The errors could have hurt some users. Basically do not use this book alone. The Cram sheet is great though. I recommend SAMS Teach Yourself MCSE Windows 98 in 14 days over it (I'd give that book a 4 star rating). That book helped me pass with over 94% on the test."
4,Great Study Supplemental!,"This book is very good for helping you pass the Win98 exam. I do think, however, that it goes into too much detail concerning VM's,16-bit and 32-bit drivers,and other core Win98 functions that only programmers would care about."
4,Collection of short stories related to cocaine,"This collection of 17 stories though uneven at times, as might expected, is all in all a worthwhile read. I particularly enjoyed Ten Keys by Lee Child about a guy trying to rip off drug dealers; Susan Straight's Poinciana about a strung out hooker;Chemistry by Robert Ward about the set up in a bar of a self styled stud; Golden Pacific by Nina Revoyr about the sad life of a 13 year old girl forced into prostitution;Sentimental Value by Manuel Ramos about a former star athlete who was seriously injured in Vietnam; Just Surviving Another day by Detrice Jones about the day to day struggle for survival of a black schoolgirl;and Bill Moody's Camaro Blue about a jazz musician who ends up touched romantically by the death of a car thief."
4,Helpful,My son used this product to study for the SAT... Very helpful and a Great Price! Worth every penny....
2,not good for the price,"This MP3-CD player is great for playing regular cd's but I would not recomend this for mp3, If is not the correct format it play's it too fast or too slow"
2,Only plays 128 bit rate,"I was disappointed to realize that the player can only play bit rates of 128. Many of the mp3 files that I have are audio books that I like to listen to while I travel, and they are compressed to lower bit rates. The sound quality was good, but its usefulness is very limited. Also, the display is difficult to see. I returned mine the next day and ordered a player capable of handling multiple bit rates."
3,a near miss IMHO,"I really want to like this product, and think there's a lot to like, especially at this price. But...I have a hard-riding car and have had the player cut out on me repeatedly. And I mean soft reboot, not skip. Which is annoying, but even worse because random play is not truly random! I.E. random play is the same pseudorandom sequence every time! This is miserable for mp3-cdrs."
2,Not a good player if you're on the move,"I liked how this player worked sitting on a desktop or in my car. But when I took it with me on a walk or bike ride, it skipped constantly. I had it in a nice padded carrying case on my bike ride and it still skipped terribly. Sent it back and my next try will the Aiwa XP-mp3c"
1,THINK TWICE!!,It worked very well the first dozen or so times I used it. Now it doesn't work at all. This site doesn't give any warranty information. I wonder why?
2,Bissell,"Price was good, sound was tolerable, but the bags were very expensive.We scrapped it for a Bissell filter canister type."
3,Bissell Vacuum,Worked great but started to short out on the cord after awhile. The first one I bought did the same thing. This is my second relacement and last. Other wise it was a great Vacuum.
5,Awesome vacuum cleaner!,"This has been the best vacuum I've ever owned. After a back injury my Kirby was too heavy to maneuver so I purchased the Bissell Butler. It's great because:- it's light-weight & easy to move around- you can use it with or without a bag- the pole extends so you dont have to bend over- the cord rewinds automatically w/the push of a button- the suction is very strongThe only thing negative about it is that the bags have been hard to find. Couldn't find them locally so I had to purchase via the internet, but that's only a minor inconvenience."
4,Thank You Bissell for bringing us this Samsung Vacuum,"I'm a big fan of just about everything Samsung makes.I have an Avanti electronic washing machine -- in reality, it's a Samsung, but not sold by them in the USA.This vacuum is a similar item. It's really a Samsung VC 6714H.Anyhow, I concur with all the above comments made by others. I also have a Samsung Quiet Storm 9048B. They make GREAT vacuums!The only thing I dislike about the vacuum is the frequency with which the cup has to be emptied. I have golden retrievers, and that hair fills the cup REALLY fast.On the other hand, as others have said, it saves bags."
4,Poor Man's Nuke,"- It's bigger than it appears in the picture, or I thought. The bag is tiny in comparison, but that should not be a problem because of the dust cup.- The cup is fun to watch, but a little awkward to maneuver in tighter space. It would be perfect if it's mounted on the base. Making me wonder whether the notorious Dyson might have even more fun. Just saw someone there mentioning he/she got a $500 Animal for regular job and another $500 canister for under the furniture! Damn, I'm a poor man!- The cord doesn't retract fully, leaving out a foot dangling outside, can't even push it in. But I can live with that.- The wand should be able to retract further, making it easier to store- The brush caught up quite some stuff during the first run, has to be removed by hand.- Got quite hot after short use, maybe that's normal?- The Tool Clip doesn't fit the wand, nor the dusting brush itselfOverall, very good, well worth the money."
2,Like fingernails on a chalkboard,"I gave this two stars because the poses/stretches really are good for your hips. What I can't take is the awful background ""music"" which is akin to the humming sound a light bulb that is about to fail makes. It actually gave me a headache and I couldn't finish the practice. Her shortened instructions are irritating, at least to me. She doesn't speak in complete sentences, ever. Everything is ""knee to chest"" or ""arms to sides"". This goes on for nearly an hour. There is also no flow to this video; it's just one hip opening pose after another, which isn't a bad thing if you just want to work on tight hips."
2,ok product,"does the job, but overall it is not made very well. It frays when you cut it, which can make it unsightly if you are hanging a LED TV on your wall and want to hide the cords. If you are simply using it for cord management behind a desk it will work well"
4,Great beginner set,"Our 2 1/2 year old daughter loves to play with the Thomas Train set at a local educational toy store we frequent. There is always a full blown temper tantrum when we leave so we figured maybe it was worth getting for home...until we saw the price. Today we saw this set in Toys R Us retail location. We decided to start small in case she like playing at the store but got bored quickly at home. She's now been playing with it for 1 1/2 hours straight. She's even managed to completely ignore the fact that there is food around (which she NEVER does!) We will be going back for expansion sets very soon I think.With all the toys she has with batteries and ""bells & whistles"" I love the fact that she is so enthralled with a simple wooden train. Best toy we've ever bought her! She is even making animal sound for the cow, horse & piggy."
3,Nice toy but track is not durable,"My daughter got this train for Christmas and she plays with it constantly however because the track is made out of a soft wood I have already had to take it back several times because the wooden track has been broken. Where the track connects to each other is weak as well and the wood has come off in chunks therefore making it hard to go back together,"
3,Not for three year old boys.,I gave this to my son for his third birthday. The cars are held together with magnets. The south end of the car must connect to the north end of the car in front of it. This confused and frustrated my three year old. The wooden track lasted one day. It is not quite tuff enough for a toddler. This is a toy more suited to kids 4 and over.Caution: small wooden cars make good projectiles.
3,Fun!,My daughter (2 yrs) loves her new train set. It's fun and learning in one toy. Whether its working the puzzle-like pieces or just running the train around the track she has a ball. It's a toy the whole family enjoys.
5,The ultimate Alternative Christmas music album.,Check out Daddy's Drinking All Our Christmas. The old Commander at his tongue in cheek best. The music is sublime.
2,Military History Will Do You Better,"While this book is good at showing how some of the quirks of the game make you use units a little different than real life, this book really offers nothing in the way of strategy that you won't learn from reading military history and tactics.-- JJ Timmins"
2,Price was nice,My heart was a little messed up it showed some black from the shirt part not much push just a wired bra and it was uncomfortable it would have been worth it if I got the matching panties but for the price I guess its nice.
2,I wasn't expecting ancient history.,"The more modern essays in this book are wonderful. Theresa Dulce's ""Spanish Fly Guinea Pig"" contains just the sort of detail that I wanted to read about the life of a human drug tester.However, I would have happily paid less and done without pages 64 to 145. Essays about The bombing of Guernica in 1937, studies of hepatitis in 1945, and Japanese bacteriological experiments in 1938-45 just plain didn't interest me. I suppose everyone interested in medical research should be familiar with the Nuremberg Code of Medical Ethics (1948); sorry, I wasn't. Jesse Gelsinger's tragic story was told in full on the web site where I found out about this book: why would I want to pay to read it again?Save your money. Don't buy the book. The website has enough interesting stuff to read for free, and the extra essays that you pay for in the bound book aren't worth it.http://www.guineapigzero.com/"
4,"Good, but some errors","This game guide is okay, but may not be the best according to others. (I never read any of the other Dino Crisis strategy guides) There are some mistakes, which take of a star in the rating like for example, one of the deceased bodies are named 'Mark Doyle' not 'James Doyle.' I don't know where the author found that. And secondly, the second crane game's instructions from the guide are wrong, they don't work. As far as the walkthrough goes, its pretty straight-forward. There are not plenty of screenshots, but there are enough. The author needs to do some more revising and editing in his future books, and the only reason I rated it 4 stars is because of the errors, otherwise, its an okay game guide."
1,Horrible U.S edition of Saint Seiya.,"As a Saint Seiya fan, I am utterly disgusted with what DIC did to the Saint Seiya/Knights of the Zodiac series. Not only is the original music cut, but the English dubbing is simply horrible. The voice-actors are mediocre but the dubbed script was unacceptably bad. If DIC insist on a English dub, at least they can put more effort in making a decent script."
1,And You Ran. You Ran So Far Away.,"""Saint Seiya"" is a classic. ""Knights of the Zodiac"" is not. And that's unfortunate. The original materials had a lot of potential to be a hit. It could've been the next ""Dragonball Z"", or even the next ""Pokemon"". But, no. DIC's reckless butchering made this show terrible to watch, with its rewritten dialogue, heavily edited fights, and mediocore music. I hate to say this, because edited or not, this show is still ""Saint Seiya"" to me, but please -- stay away from this. The only thing that was remotely good about ""Knights of the Zodiac"" is the theme song, a cover of A Flock of Seagull's ""I Ran (So Far Away)"". If you are even slightly interested in ""Knights of the Zodiac"", then do yourself a favor and get the original ""Saint Seiya"" DVDs. You won't regret it."
1,Buy Saint Seiya instead of this version,"This version is downright disrespectful to the original series called ""Saint Seiya"", which is being released by ADV. This version is poorly scripted, poorly acted, and poorly edited. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE."
1,DIC destroyed this one thoroughly.,"This anime went from armor clad warriors in bone shattering cataclysmic fights to armor wearing surfer dudes in brief flashes of punches.After seeing a scene were 4 unconscious warriors cheer on the main character in their surfer dude lingo, I turned off the tv in disgust. I mean, face down laying on the ground, completely motionless, yelling ""you can do it, dude!""Stay away from DIC. They destroyed Saint Saiya inside and out."
5,Knights of the Zodiac ROCKS!,I disagree with all the reviews thus far. I think Knights of the Zodiac is an awesome show with great characters and awesome music! I can't wait for a KOZ CD to come out. I think this version is way better than the longer version which is too violent and the voices sound too old.Don't listen to the other reviews. KOZ is awesome!
3,Surprisingly slack approach to a challenging discipline,"I'd like to advise a little caution in buying this set: it does not contain enough solid information about how to really ""do"" any kind of ""Pilates-based"" (this is not official Pilates) exercise. If you already bought this video you can use it as a good 'pacer' for breathing and momentum, ..."
3,Too Easy,"If you have been doing Pilates for a while and you want a challenging workout, these tapes are not for you. I have been doing another tape for 6 months now (The Method: Precision Toning), and these tapes presented no challeging excercises. I will use tape 3 on days that I need a light relaxing workout without a lot of effort. I don't think I will ever user tape 1 or tape two. They are way too easy. The good thing about them is that they are only 30 minutes long and the music is great."
5,Great purchase,"I'm going on a trip to Europe in June and this DVD was very helpful. It helped me to decide which cities I would like to visit. If you like Samantha Brown, this is a great buy."
5,"Five stars, one question:","how can anyone resist Samantha Brown? Her tours are always relatively informative; she always seems to be having a delightful time wherever she is; and she's ""sigh""-provokingly adorable. These three programs I found to be particularly interesting in that I managed to learn a thing-or-two about these locations that I never knew."
3,Samantha Brown Germany,"I didn't think it had enough travel tips. She tends to stay in expensive hotels and not worry about a budget. It was nice to get a view of the places, but not helpful if you are trying to find ways to plan a trip."
2,"Good itinerary but not in depth, badly edited, & not funny!","On this DVD, Samantha Brown offers a great itinerary of the Austria & Germany which she visits during the winter but is not nearly as in depth as Rick Steves' or Rudy Maxa! Her bad jokes that are funny 1/10 times really kill the flow of the show as well. Samantha caters to the soccer moms of America but is more concerned about staying in a fancy hotel and getting a fancy dinner than actually learning about her surroundings. She spends way too much time talking up her hotel & eating rather than showing us more sites or offering any kind of history or background of the area. Just like getting half a meal at a restaurant and wondering what happened, Samantha Brown's programs seem way too short and leave the viewer longing for more information, creating more unanswered questions. For a more thorough series watch ""Best of Europe by Rudy Maxa"" or ""Rick Steves' Europe: All 80 Shows 2000-2009""."
1,"Nice video footage, Better without hostess and her lack of class or grace","I was searching for a serious exploration of the country. This dvd spends most of the time focused on the host making stupid jokes and acting quite obnoxious. She has no grace, and resembles a male host vs. a female. She dresses herself up nice and then acts without any class. She might as well have gotten drunk on the show and started belching. I was embarrassed for her. The locals must have thought she was just crude. If she took one moment to notice the people around her, she would have seen that the women are not loud-mouth, gesticulating people. She appears to be trying way to hard to be funny. Better to seach the VHS selection.Touring Switzerland"
1,Vintage Twain but very badly formatted for Kindle,"This is vintage Twain humor and widely cited by translation scholars. However, this Kindle version is seriously flawed. Upon changing the size of the font, each line acts as a separate paragraph and wraps awfully making the reading extremely awkward."
4,very cute,"This costume is very cute. The hat though could be cuter, it kind of reminds me of 'The Flying Nun'! But i have a different helmet he can wear. All in all, it's very cute!"
4,Our son loves this!,"We gave this set to our son for Christmas, who just turned 4. He loves ""all things firefighter"" so we knew this would work well. The coat is decent quality and fits well with room for growth. The siren on the walkie-talkie has low volume. This allows him to enjoy it without the siren becoming too loud (or annoying). One the downside, the extinguisher's quality is poor, and has stopped working after a couple of weeks. Also, the badge keeps slipping off the front of the coat. This could probably be fixed with some double sided tape, or velco. All in all we are pleased and would recommend it for the little firefighter in your life!"
4,One of my masters of male tought,"Mark Lanegan is a man full of wisdom, listening to him you can put your ideas in perspective if your girlfriend dumped you Ha!, can provide to you of new ways to see life, you can mature new philosophies, the man has a fascinating personality, cool , easy, careless about stupid matters, listen ""dont forget me"" , listen ""Kimikos dream house"" ""low"" ""she done too mouch"" with that cool, rough and calm voice the man has, that invites you to serenity , youll be a whole new man after listen to him is therapeuticHM"
4,Ol' Gravelvoice Returns...,"With his last album of fairly obscure cover versions, Mark Lanegan found a niche for himself as a low-key and brooding vocalist with the uncanny ability to transform songs of an incredibly simple and almost sentimental nature into documents of organic honesty and beguiling urgency. ""Field Songs"" extends this talent to a new set of original compositions, as Lanegan's bourbon-soaked baritone drifts effortlessly through slow-tempo accounts of longing and loss, adding a uniquely masculine sensitivity to the sea of voices that fills the contemporary music scene."
4,"Just the ""Fix"" I needed.","This is a really great album. It's sung and played beautifully. I don't want to make a general statement, but it does sound like one might expect it to, meaning ""Screaming Trees"" light. That's fine with me though, I always loved their mellow stuff as much as the other. I won't even mention which tracks are the good ones, they all are. ""Mark Lanegan"" is obviously known for his smooth yet rough voice, and it is the star here, but the band is right on as well. I mean with ex-members of ""Soundgarden"" and ""Dinosaur Jr."", how could it not be. This is highly recommended for anyone with a cool taste in music."
1,not my favourite,"first of all the title suggests that kids with issues are bad people, which is far from the truth. Kristy's neighbors get a foster kid for about a month and she does a lot of bizzare things and is rude and aggressive, even to the baby sitters and kristy feels like she has enough, but then the girl opens up about her life and at the end she is reunited with an aunt and her brother which is good. Also, most of the kids they sit for seem too good to be true and it's like the kids are always ""normal"" so when a kid who is having a lot of internal issues comes along she is categorized as ""not normal"" for being rude and all. Time to time there have been BSC books addressing baby sitting charges with autism, dyslexia, so there is a possibility that the girl may have been dealing with depression or anxiety and that could have been addressed in the book, and may have empowered children who read this book and were dealing with their own issues."
2,Too sad,I found this movie to be sad and depressing. I have a had a hard time getting the sadness out of my head. I could not recommend this movie.
2,Seems familiar...,"Thsi movie tries to play off the relationship of the brothers and it does a fine job but sometimes it feels forced and a bit familiar. Even though I liked the brothers, I feel that the straight one (can't remember his name) makes too huge of a transition over the course of this film. I suppose it could happen....This film seems to borrow parts from other movies. There is the ""Memento"" style beginning and end (which I though was masterfully done), The ""Rites of Passage"" brother thing, and a scene or two borrowed from ""Philadelphia"".Well acted, technically sound, and entertaining. This film could be a good addition to one's home video collection but there isn't much in it that is original."
4,Strathwood lily rain chain,This is just lovely. I ordered more than one to get the length I wanted and am very happy with the things!
2,aaaaaaah ! !,It was the worst comedy show I have seen in a long time. Omg. They guy is not a funny stand up comic in my opinion. Maybe that's why I never heard of him. The product came quickly and undamaged.
5,FANTASTIC!!!,I laughed so hard that I was finding it difficult to breath. Fantastic! If you haven't seen Tommy Tiernan's material before or even if you're an old fan -- buy this DVD! You won't regret it.
5,Indepth & refreshing !,"""Strange Highways"" takes you on a journey few dare to go! An honest and actual investigation into the unknown. Author Jerry D. Coleman taps into the true logic we all wish to express, truly a refreshing piece of work!!"
1,Use An Editor--PLEASE!!!,"While interesting because of the subject matter, this book contains so many spelling errors, typos, garbled sentences, and mis-used words that I could hardly read it. There are errors on every single page! I think the author has some compelling ideas but he really needs an editor--I cannot believe a publishing company would put this out with their imprint on it. Don't waste your money."
4,"Strange Stories, Many Of Which Involve Mr. Coleman","Dealing with Cryptozoology to Mass Murderers. Ghosts and Springheeled Jack, there's something for everyone fascinated with the bizarre. Many tales are personal experiences of the author himself, like the time he was followed down the highway by John Wayne Gacy. Yikes! But as one previous reviewer has already noted, very much in need of an editor. Many errors throughout. And a terribly grainy quality to the photographs. But it will still hold your interest if you're into the unexplained."
4,"Strange places, wierd happenings!",So far I have liked this book as there are a lot of strange happenings in various places across the United States that you would not hear about otherwise. If you like reading about mysterious unknown animals and such I would recommend this book.
5,Fangs for some great jazz!,"Tenor and organ albums don't get much better than this. A pair of Northwest tenor greats, Hadley Caliman and Gary Hammon nimbly work their way through a great set of hard bop classics and originals with the help of Nicholas Hoffman on guitar, Delvon Dumas on the B3 and Jud Sherwood on drums. Caliman and Hammon make for a formidable front line as they interpret Cedar Walton's ""Ugetsu,"" Herbie Hancock's ""Driftin'"" and the breathtaking ""On A Misty Night"" by Tad Dameron. In addition, Hammon, Caliman and Hoffman provide wonderfully written originals that blend seamlessly into this brilliant set. Hammon's ""Slightly in the Tradition"" is worth the price of admission alone. Get it!"
1,"These canisters are hunter green, not black!",Just a warning - These canisters are actually a deep hunter green. I was very disappointed and returned them.
4,Not as bad as I thought it woudl be,"My 8 year old son has been asking for this since it came out. I was extremely reluctant. I was thinking it was very dungeons and dragons-ish and really did not want him to have it. Suffice to say he did get it this christmas. After struggling through the 3 manuals, we kind of compromised on using the real rules versus his own rules. We played for hours and it was fabulous. I think they should make the age limit a bit older as it is a little complicated for an 8 year old. Over all.. very cool game!"
5,Excellent play value for all ages,"Your imagination is your only limit to this game. You can play the provided scenarios ( where the balance of play was well thought out and well play tested ) or make up your own. The mark of a great game, for all ages, is when my 8yr and 10yr olds can beat their father. We can't wait to buy the eagerly awaited extention packages."
5,Heroscape Master Set Review,"Heroscape is a fun, fast paced, easy to learn, game. It combines a 3d board game with a building toy, making a board which you can create. The peices included all come pre-painted,pre-glued, and fairly durable. over all, it is a great game."
4,heroscape,"My son who's 12 loves this game. I personally think it takes to long to set up the game every time you play. It takes him about a 1/2 hour. If you don't mind that, it's a great game."
5,Great for Kids Over 12.,"This is a very good game for kids who get bored with toys quickly, because you can arrange and rearrange it over and over. However, it really isn't suitable for eight-year-olds, as the box suggests. My 8 and 9 year old sons weren't really ready for such a complex game, but my 12 year old nephew absolutely loved it, and continues to play with it regularly over a year later."
4,A very smart battle.,I bought this toy for my kid for his birthday and he liked it very much. I have played with him some battles and we had fun. I would like to give you a suggestion: put instructions in other languages for kids outside the States.
4,Heroscape Master Set,My son loves this toy. He likes to create his own maps and the rules are easy to understand. He plans on getting expansion sets in the future to build on the fun.
3,Heroscape,"I purchased this game for my son. We saw it at Walmart and the only master set thay had was the Marvel one. And then the exspansion sets were for the other Master sets. He thought it was the coolest thing ever. So we went online to check it out, and figured out how to play and everything. So I bought him a set. He loves it. Its so detailed. The game pieces are cool, he likes the dragons. Thank you."
4,Lots of fun,My kids really love this game ... they are too young to actually play the full game but they love setting up the hexes into different configurations and putting the characters on it. Both my son (7) and daughter (5) enjoy it.
5,Great game,"I bought this game for my 8year old brother for his birthday. We tried to play as a family, but it ended up a fiasco. The other day my brother asked if I would play with him. It took a while setting up, but was worth the effort. We played for about an hour and a half, and it was a fun filled battle with robots, agents, dragons, and knights. I ended up winning the game, but my brother challenged me to a rematch and beat me. I enjoy playing this game with my brother because now we have something we can do together. This game is not just for young kids, I am about to turn 15 and I realy enjoy this game. I recommend after a month or two, making your own board and special rules. (we played that the tan ground pieces were quick sand and you couldnt stop on them) It is a great game people of all ages. A+++ great game!"
2,Way to complicated,"This game is for 8+ year olds but I don't know what the person(s) who designed it were thinking. The instructions and setup are too complicated. There are too manny pieces to this game and it was dificult gettig them back in the box. I can see pieces getting lost that are critical to the game. My grandson probably put Heroscape on his wish list because he liked the game pieces. My grandson, his dad and I played the game for a few hours and my grandson enjoyed the game. I don't think he will pull it out and play it with his friends because it takes to long to set up. I was very disapointed."
3,It came in THIS box?,"Hasbro/Milton Bradley are doing a good job alienating parents. The packaging for this product is nothing short of diabolical. Why any company would releaes a game that cannot be repacked in it's box is beyond me. C'mon, it's a game, duh.Too bad as it's a good game. I guess this is what happens when you have good game design but moronic product management."
1,Hero Escape game,I thought the game was to completed to play for my age and also my dad had trouble figuring the game.I really looked forward to receving this game and I was disappointed when I couldn't play.The only thing I injoyed was the playing pieces using them as action figures.I would not recommend this game.
5,Creative strategy game,"This game has been set up since it was opened on Christmas morning. The parish priest dropped by for an unannounced visit, saw the game and asked to play. I thought the sci-fi characters and grusome warriors might put him off a bit but he loved it. It has evolved with each game and we still haven't gotten to the advanced strategies."
5,Awesome Interactive Game,This game really brings my son & I together & he's learning so much that he doesn't realize he's learning - like creative problem solving!!! Definitely worth the money.
5,game,"Christmas gift.He loved it,in fact he we purchased more for his birthday.Thanks again.We will purchase more in the future.Stephanie Haynes"
1,A Waste of Company Money!,"If my boss reads this review and finds out I'm wasting company money buying useless books like this I've got trouble.This book isn't a manual. This is a nice review of accounting in general and describes a few accounting functions. For example, it devotes six pages to a description of Bills of Exchange processing - good reading for anyone but not much about how to mechanically process them in SAP.It mentions SAP, but if you think you'll learn how to use the FI module by reading this book, forget it."
1,It is not what you are looking for,"Whatever it is you think this book is about, it is not what you think it is. The book does not talk much about the SAP R/3 system at all, but a mix of some basic accounting concepts and a little bit of SAP screen shots. Fortunately I borrowed this book from the library, otherwise I really would be kicking myself for shelling out $ for this useless book. If you want to learn about SAP R/3 system, you probably have better luck in your company's training classes. The only useful part I got from this book is a listing of all the posting keys.SAP is not a bad system, it is just very complicated and the training is dismal at best. I wish someone will write a better introductory book.(Review on December 7, 2005)"
1,Sigh!,"See my review of Crosscurrents. Sadly, years later, my general observations still apply. However, ""2 B Organic"" and ""Me and Shirley T"" are good. ""Touch"" (a well-known Classical guitar piece mysteriously retitled) has sensitive ukulele playing but about 1/3 of the way through the mechanical backing jumps in and ruins it.Sigh!"
1,Take a nap,"I read about this guy in the Boston Globe - they said he was the Jimi Hendrix of the ukulele. I bought this. The young man is a competent player, but this music is about as exciting as warm milk. Maybe he is some hot shakes live, but I couldn't even make it through the whole CD. I have many Jimi CDS. This ain't that."
4,Try it - you'll like it!,"I think if you like Earl Klugh and Stanley Jordon you will like Jake Shimabukuro. In Jake's hands the ukulele sounds like a guitar. I heard ""Floaters"" on the radio so I bought this CD.I thought the entire album was going to be acoustic ukulele music. I was very surprised when I heard the other tracks. There are a lot of background instruments. The music is very upbeat but at times the arrangements seem to overwhelm the ukulele.The CD was not what I expected. However, it is a terrific CD.I will spend may enjoyable hours listening to it. I look forward to buying more of his CD's."
4,Pleasant fusion jazz fare from the Ukulele virtuoso,"In this CD, ukulele genius Jake Shimabukuro wraps his pleasant, if not entirely original, compositions with fully orchestrated arrangements. The end result is listenable enough, but does not do justice to his amazing talent. Best cuts are the title cut, ""Me and Shirley T"" (the drink, not the actress) and ""Touch"". A cover version of ""En Aranjuez Con Tu Amor"" falls flat.Try to catch Jake live. There is nothing quite like it. I'm looking forward to his next project, which is presumably an all solo instrumental disc."
5,This guys is amazing!,He is wonderful! It is a very cool cd that I highly recommend. Jake is an amazing musician. I saw him one night on Conan and was hooked after that. I was blown away when I went to a Jimmy Buffett and saw him as part of the band.
5,Perfect replacement,I got this to replace the original shure stylus for my record player. It is a great low cost replacement. My records sound great and I am happy to be able to continue to enjoy my records.
3,Stylus,Was not new old stock the way I thought is was going to be. It is not actually Shure. It does work and I will take it. Live and learn.
5,An evening with John Vance,"The smooth, romantic vocals of John Vance, accompanied by; Jeff Colella on Piano, Randy Landas on Bass and Rod Harbour on Drums, is to be thoroughly enjoyed in the arms of your lover while you sit in front of the fireplace. Or, you could gently take your lover by the hand and slow dance, by candlelight, to John Vance. Savor every tasty note of his standards. I highly recommend this CD."
4,FOR MOTHER ON XMAS!,I REMEMBER THIS SMELL FOR YEARS BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MY MOTHER'S CHOICE OF PERFUME! IT IS ALL WAYS NICE TO HAVE A MOTHER THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE THROUG A SMELL! NO I AM NOT A MOMMIES BOY BUT I DO LOVE MY MOTHER AND THIS IS A GREAT PERFUME FOR THE LADIES!
3,Slow and focused on breathing,"PRO: This yoga video, is slow and focused on breathing, without being 'easy'. Many of the slower paced yoga videos end up not being challenging, this one is. She doesn't over 'talk' but she does give enough instruction that while you are in the pose you can strive to get good alignments going.CON: She gives new names to many of the poses (Adho Mukha Svanasana/Down ward facing dog becomes Mountain). Also, if you are newer to yoga you will not full understand all the aspects of the pose, as there is no resource describing the poses individually."
4,Review of Pastures of Beyond,"A wonderful collection of stories about the life of cowboys and indians during the 1930s, 40s and 50s. The author provides a look back at a period of time in the American West that is now gone."
2,it Was a big let down.,A friend of mine told me that this was a great cd. Now i do like they might be giants but this is crude compaired to Flood or Lincon. Which were much betterOnly about 3 song are any good. Skip this one and get Flood
5,Their Best,"I loved this CD from the first time I heard it. ""Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head"" is the most invigorating song ever written and I just love how funny they can make utterly profound lyrics. They do it all over this CD. ""Alienation's For The Rich"", ""Song Number 3"", ""I Hope I Die Before I Get Old"", are all great examples of hilarious songs that are profound and even the short songs are genius. Everything fits together and there is not a single lull. They Might Be Giants continues to display their wit and musical brilliance, but it all came together here."
4,An Overlooked Effort,"The debut album from They Might Be Giants is very strong. Many people that I know that like this group rarely mention this album. Most of the songs are ""way out there"" and that adds to the appeal of TMBG. The album is worth the price just to hear ""Boat of Car,"" one of the strangest songs out of all of the strange songs by TMBG. But, the rest are just as fun! From the loony ""Put Your Hand Inside the Puppet Head"" to the awesome ""Don't Let's Start,"" you are treated to a lot of musical styles throughout the entire album. If you are a new fan, I wouldn't start with this album, but I would add it to your collection soon."
2,Funny But Forgetable Shoegazer Technopunk.,"They Might Be Giants' 1987 self titled debut is a 19 song collection of interesting sounding ideas that don't work out. The character of ""Chess Piece Face"" stands out as the best of the bunch. These 2 guys obviously had a great deal of fun making this album, especially with a tricked out 80's Casio Keyboard (perhaps with the Air Drum Sticks attachment?) Thankfully as we all well know, they went on to record the theme to ""Malcom In The Middle"" called ""You're Not The Boss Of Me"" (unfortunately not on this album, but it would be out-of-place anyway). Despite my take on this album, it is a very sought after collector's item with prices from $10 to $20 used, and double those new. There are very few copies in circulation with a coninuing demand.It is as amusing as it is underwhelming."
3,Can you capture the Dark Knight in one book?,"The gatherers of the stories for this book must have had a very hard time (in fact their introductions & end notes are very enjoyable to read, even more enjoyable than some of the stories in the book)...The authers tried to capture the Batman saga & to chronicle his appearances in 40 years...Some of the stories are great because they are clasic & very old... they introduced important writers & artists... others were great because of the sory line e.g killer of the dark skies echoing the great character enemy ace (lord Von Hammer)...The book was denied many good stories because of differnt reasons: the Joker had a complete separate volume for his stories... I wanted to see Bats interacting with Gordon & other mature Gotham characters...none of this I found here...a good read but If you're expecting the dark Batman of the eighties with mysterious plots this is not the book for you..."
1,Not worth it,"It's not the Batman that's worth reading. This features a killing, machine gun-wielding Batman of the '30s. A goofy, time travelling Batman from the '50s and they dominate the book. A few redeeming 1970's stories don't make it worth the price."
4,Writers and Monsters,This book is an excellent source for anyone researching the Victorian era and the issues surrounding women writers. The book provides both statistical and interpretive information for any serious student or literary fan.
5,Great book for Saturn car owner,As good as every other repair manual. Great to have to do your own repairs. This book pays for it self in the money you save by doing the repair/tuneup yourself.Has all the vacuum and wiring diagrams!
4,Hakuba Carbon Fiber HG-503MX,"A very good tripod for the money. It won awards for its Pan Handle and grips. Sorry no bubble level built into the tripod but you can always put one on the cameras hot shoe. Very light,compact,user friendly and can support alot of weight."
4,THIS LISTING IS ACTUALLY FOR THE CASSETTE VERSION!!!,"People should note that this listing is for the CASSETTE TAPE version of the BEAT THE BOOTS Boxset!!! I've seen people refferring to it as having ""discs"" and this listing is for tapes, not CDs.Just thought I'd clear that up! Otherwise, check out the other cool customer images of the actual boxset. I have no idea what that picture is that Amazon has listed here."
2,kindle edition,this book has either missing text and or pages. it also has page headers in the middle of the book instead of the top of the page. several lines of text are black squares and rectangles. makes it hard to read and follow.
4,"My Son Loves it, but smaller batteries pose risks",My son loves this little toy. It keeps him busy during feeding time and it's also funny to look at. I don't like that these new toys are coming with the smaller batteries (button batteries) that can be swallowed by infants/kids. How much cheaper is it to use those small batteries vs the AAA?
4,Fun for kids and pets!,"I got this because I love chihuahuas. My chihuahuas bark back at it, so it serves as a good amusement for my pets! I've had my chi-chi toy for some time, and it's quite durable and sturdy!"
4,Great For The Price!,"My daughter is crazy for chihuahuas and we could not get her a real one. We already own a real dog. So when I saw this little guy at Amazon.com, I knew she would love it. Despite of some negative reviews, I still purchased it - and as long as she doesn't keep it on for too long, it is still going strong. No faults yet. It is absolutely adorable, and even if it eventually stops barking, she can still play with it. I definetely recommend it!"
1,"Chi-Chi, She no move!","We were looking forward to welcoming Chi-Chi into our family. We already have a chihuahua about the same size and wondered what her reaction would be to Chi-Chi. Unfortunately Chi-Chi shuddered a bit after we threw the on switch, but no much else. It's the kind of toy that usually has a short life, but our Chi was DOA. On the bright side the return was smooth."
3,not what I thought,"This dog makes a mechanical yep sound and does not sound like you would expect... it is just as annoying as real Chihuahua Puppies... my son loves the dog but is not a REAL Furreal Friend, like we see at Wal-mart."
2,Be gentle with Chi-Chi!,"My 4 year old got this cute little dog from ""Santa"" and by the next day it no longer barked and had a broken leg. [...] For being a children's toy, it's not very durable so luckily it's not too expensive."
5,Cute!,It's a really cute toy for my little 10 month old baby she loves watching it bark. It's totally worth the money I paid.
3,Fun for young children.,"My 3 year old loves this toy. Inexpensive and entertaining. The barking is a bit annoying, just like the real thing."
2,not as good looking as those sold in counter,"the chihuahua can move, bark and up and down, but this one does not have a delicated details like those sold in counter, actually, it looks not like a chihuahua, I'd rather to spend two more dollars to buy one in store !!"
4,Fun dog!,"My daughter LOVES dogs, and would love to have one, but this is as close as we're getting. It walks and barks, and she thinks it's the greatest thing ever."
5,Cute!!!!!!,My daughter loved this little dog. She treats it as its a real puppy. I would definately recommend this product for kids.
4,Cute!,"The bark of this little chihuahua is definitely a little annoying after awhile, but what's to be expected? I had this in mind when I bought it, and it's very cute the way it walks around. Our cats were a little wary...."
4,"The ""Extra"" Art History Textbook: A Writing Manual Roundup","""I know of two books specifically geared toward teaching writing in art history courses. They are Sylvan Barnet's A Short Guide to Writing About Art and Henry Sayre's Writing About Art. Their strength lies in addressing common problems that students face in the art history classroom.

5,Whoop whoop,CASTS GREAT SMALL AND I LOVE THE LITTLE TACKLE BOX SO COOL I CANT WAIT TO USE IT IN THE FIELD
2,RONCO POCKET FISHERMAN,"I bought the Pocket Fisherman for pickeral fishing on Lake of the Woods in Ontario. Fit and finish was good. I followed the directions and it worked well. Casted not too bad. We caught 9 walleyes total; three by the RONCO. My main beef about this rig is that it is very difficult telling when a fish is on the line. My guess is that the rod is so short and stiff that it does not transmit the movement of the fish on the line very well to the fisherman's hand. eg, I felt a tug on the line and it felt like I was reeling in a dead load of seaweed, no fight at all. When I got the ""seaweed"" to the side of the boat, I was amazed to see a twelve inch walleye. I think perhaps there are better telescoping rods on the market. I give this product two stars **"
1,do not waste your time,I got the pocket fisherman for my cat. It worked 1 time.I cast the line for my cats to chase and that was it.this would be one of the best cat toy if it worked
4,Works surprisingly well,"I was shocked at how well it casted and reeled in. I never caught any fish, so i cannot coment on how it handles with a fish on its line"
4,Have not used it yet....,I was very pleased with the item as it arrived on time and was exactly what I was expecting for what I had ordered!!!!!
3,Had one when I was a kid,"Saw it when I was doing a bit of shopping for some light weight camping and fishing gear,I had one as a kid there are more fancy setups for sure but it is simple reliable and inexpensive. Mostly I remember having one as kid and it is still just as fun to use. I keep it in my truck, doesn't take up any room so why not"
1,Bought Two - Both Break After About 20 Casts Each,"Bought two Pocket Fishermans, one each for my 13-year old son and 15-year old son. Both are experienced at fishing and using fishing gear. Both handled them properly. Both Pocket Fishermans broke after about 20 casts. The line would no longer reel back in. There was nothing we could do to fix them. Don't waste your money."
2,So-So,Loved this little item - until I caught a fish. Then noticed the reel holder pops open while trying to reel in larger game fish and it happens EVERY time so you end up struggling to put the reel back into place while fighting to keep your fish on the line and land it. That alone is so frustrating I will probably not use it again.
4,Perfect for catching pocket fish,"At last the solution I have been looking for to catch the pesky fish in my pocket. I have always struggled to find the right combination of weights, floats and rods to hunt down and catch the fish that inhabit my pockets. They are very wily and canny those pocket fish <grrrrrrrr>. The worst ones are the ones in my denims. Oh how they elude and taunt me so!Yet now thanks to Ronco the problem is solved at a stroke. I can easily go fishing in those boring business meetings or when waiting for a train. Perfect. With my favourite Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz and my Ronco Pocket Fisherman I am so good to go. I can fish any time and any where I like. Those sneaky pocket fish have no where to hide now. Gotcha!"
1,not good dont buy,"first fish, no drag, dont spend your money on it, very dissappointed, pitched it..a waste of money and time,the only good thing is it was cute looking"
1,Cant finesse a fish with this Pocket Rod,"i hooked up 3-4 times but the reel is not fine tuned enuff to drag a battle to more than a few seconds. the reel gets stuck and i will lose the line and the fish - end of story for every story. the pocket rod aims for versatility but its small size doesn't yield enuff to keep your line. not even close to a nice try. btw, sender shipped promptly to make it smooth transaction. 1 star for seller - 0 star for the toy."
1,"This is awful quality, don't waste your money or time!","The Roncho is a terrible rod. It should be sold as a toy for five dollars - that is the quality of it. Cheap chinese garbage. The reel has no drag and it looks like it is designed to last as long as the fishing line in it. I returned it asap for a refund. You will be disappointed with this product. It is one of those ""As seen on TV"" gimmicks. Save your money and buy something that will last made anywhere but China."
5,Ronco Pocket Fisherman,I received my Ronco Pocket Fisherman within days and it's exactly as it was described. I just love it and appreciate the quick shipping.
5,The Good Old Pocket Fisherman!,"Great tool for casual fishing, small boats, hiking, camping or a survival pack. I highly recommend this product. It has actually stood the test of time and has proven to be quite useful."
1,Pocket Fisherman,This product was not working correctly right out of the package. It would not extend and then not reel back in unless you pulled the string out. Then the weight bob on the end when flying off and the string spooled inside the handle.I had one of these years ago and the quality was much better. I would be happy to pay more for a good quality piece of gear that would hold up and last because the idea was good and made great for a packing piece of equipment. These new ones seem like little toys for kids.
1,Very disappointed,"I have a set of these on my folding bike. There arent many 20 x 1 1/8"" tire options and these came with my Bike Friday folder. Since they were new Ive had noting but flats and slow leaks. A friend of mine who also has them has had the same issues. We both got ours about a year ago and have both had an instance where we got two flats in one day. Unless your riding in pristine conditions I would stay away from these. They wear quickly and dont hold up well."
1,did not work,"I had to order this for wife, as scheduled shipment of ""Nature's Wonderland Fenugreek Seed"" was delayed by amazon. The replacement reduced my wife's milk supply and stopping it increased milk supply back to the level she had before starting these capsules."
1,Warning: DO NOT BUY THIS!,"I must say that if you really like Duke Ellington, than chances are you are smart enough to stay away from this. Why, you may ask?I'll tell you why. Madacy Records (the label on which this release and all of the other 'Golden Legends' releases appear on) prices their records really cheaply, expecting people like us to get suckered into it and buy them.But I'm smart enough to know not to. The sound quality on this release is terrible! No effort whatsoever to clean up these recordings.Do yourselves a favor and buy 'Greatest Hits' (the RCA release of course) or if you want to dig deeper, buy 'The Best of The Complete RCA Victor Recordings.' The sound quality on both of those are superb.But stay far, far away from this one. There's a reason why this is so cheap.NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,incomplete tracks,"I got this because I'm looking for a specific recording of ""Happy Go Lucky Local"". The cut on this disc is apparently the right one but fades out about half way through. Don't buy it. With somebody like Duke you have to do a little research and get back to original releases as much as possible. You're going to learn more anyway."
5,Great Intro to NLD for Parents and Educators,Recently our teenager was diagnosed with NLD. This book was recommended to us by a psychologist. We found the book to be extremely helpful in explaining NLD (in plain English) and helping us understand how to deal with the NLD child. The book addresses the needs of parents with either young or adolencent children with NLD. I highly recommend this book as a starting point for parents and educators in learning about NLD.
2,not for the older NLD child,"I returned the book. It was designed for the child diagnosed at a young age. We were diagnosed at 15. Found other books that were more helpful (also from Amazon) Nonverbal Learning Disabilities by Marieke Molenaar-Klumper, which is more clinical, but a very good book and Helping a Child with Nonverbal Learning Disorder or Aspergers Disorder by Kathryn Stewart, this one less clinical, and more practical. Talk about the similarities and differences between NLD and AD."
4,Very Helpful Book,This book has provided me with very needed insight into the issues my son has been experiencing and can't express. It explained alot of what we have been going through for years. What we thought was an attitude & disciplinary issue has actually been a learning disability.My son was diagnosed in August '07 with high functioning Asperger's & NLD. He is 11 years old. I have had so much difficulty finding support & knowledge. This book was a good start!
5,Fantastic,"My husband and I were informed that our 8 year old son with Spina Bifida (myelo) and hydrocephalus has NLD. So many red flags have flown high for years now, but I continued to be reassured that he just had learning delays and that we just had an overly emotional child with a knack for tantrums. This book has lifted a large amount of weight off of my chest. Incredibly written and so informational. I know that we have a long road ahead of us (it has been a long road already with his other diagnoses so this is just another hurdle), but I feel much more confident in our ability to try to at least guide Q through life as painlessly as possible. Thank you Pamela for giving me some hope and especially for the guidance!"
3,Nothing new here,"I found the title to be misleading. This book is more instructional than an exploration of the complicated subject of ethics. It presents basic Buddhist ethical understandings, but reads like a rule book. In ""everyday life"" we experience complex and challenging ethical problems, and this book does not address such issues. I gave it three stars, thouugh, because it's simply helpful to be reminded, in another author's words, of the soundness of Buddhist principles and their application."
3,I just don't know....,"But it seems to me this is the origin of the line in the Pixies song ""Debaser"". That's all I have to say about that...."
2,71 years after it was made...,...and still nobody's figured out what this movie is about...which makes it a classic in some people's eyes...go figure...
3,I was fascinated...but curious about a few things.,"I felt this was a tremendous film, and although it's like nothing I've ever seen before, I enjoyed it for its originality and clever boldness. I was wondering if anyone out there knew HOW the eye slash scene was done. I absolutely MUST know. If you can tell me, please email me at pbarnes@ycp.edu Thanks!"
4,Surrealism at its finest...,This film is a surrealist work of genius. It is surely one every good avant garde film lover should see.
5,A must have,"This simply is one of those CDs that you must have listened to. When I heard the first two tracks I was still not very enthusiastic about the music, but as the CD progressed the music got better and better.Some might call it 'Industrial' or 'Alternative', but it really is just Thirwell, aka Foetus. Don't try to categorise it, just listen and enjoy. Listen to the typical Thirwell reincarnation of 'cool jazz' in 'Heuldoch 78', enjoy the manic 'Need machine', or be swept into the sound picture of 'Suspect', you can tell that here is a guy at work who has something meaningfull to tell, not just a bag of wind looking for a quick fix for his ego. So, do yourself a favor and buy this one, you'll never regret it."
4,"Tap Your Feet, Snap Your Neck","Thirlwell never ceases to entertain, each album is a rebirth. Even his lesser-inspired-sounding songs are better than the other (bad industrial) bands with whom he's always wrongly associated. My personal favorites are the swing/jazz songs ""Grace of God"" and ""Heuldoch 7B"". Foetus is dead - long live Foetus!"
5,What is Foetus?,"Who knows? His music is always so unique it's hard to describe. This cd is fabulous. It's...hmm...there's a lot of jazz or blues or something, & the Foetus brand minimal yet intricately wrought noise...it sounds like Foetus, but it's nothing like I expected. As usual, so much range, so unique. Foetus always keeps you guessing. Not only is it different from every other Foetus release, I'm not even sure if any 2 songs on the cd are of a similar style. It's brand new, so I haven't had it long, & I look forward to getting to know every little nuance of the music better as I listen more & more."
1,why does claudia want to marry shea rodowsky?!?,"I have never read this book, but from others' reviews, I learned that Claudia fell in love...with one of her baby-sitting charges, Shea Rodowsky!? Next thing you know, Claudia will be baby-sitting for her brother-in-laws, and Kishi will just be her maiden name-then she'll be either Claudia Rodowsky or Claudia Kishi-Rodowsky. She'll be the first BSC member to be married. Bleah!!!"
5,Long Live Kedrigern,"The Kedrigern series belongs to the best in fantasy. Unfortunately the author is dead and the publisher went belly up, so you can get it only second hand (or illegally on the net).Hopefully there will be a reprint or an e-edition."
1,OH NO!!!,"The author and her husband are infamous for selling counterfeit handbags on the web and on eBay. Please, do not support these people!!"
1,Disapointing......,"Great title but not a great resource at all. No real ""new"" or valuable information. Very few pictures that are in black and white and not very detailed."
4,Good Introduction to Birkins....,"I thought the book gave a good introduction to the birkin. It would be particularly helpful for those who do not already know the ins and outs of Hermes birkins.The author illustrates the beauty of an authentic birkin in detail. There is also a section on how to safely buy authentic birkins online for those who are impatient enough not to wait for one at the boutique.The author gives a style section that is cute and may appeal to a person with many birkins. That's just a fun section.I only wish there were more photographs in the book. Other than that, I found it nice."
1,Totally SILLY!,"First of all this is more of a brochure than a book (it's 50 pages). Now, bottom line is that you cannot guarantee authenticity on anything unless you purchase it at the brand-name store (in this case at a Hermes shop). Inside these pages is more fluff about how to decorate your Birkin (oh please, it's not a Christmas tree!) I found this entire read a complete waste of time and in the end I could not help but think some woman was simply trying to cash in on a current fashion craze. On top of it all the author has a web-site in which she sells these handbags for about $5,000 more than they sell for at a Hermes shop."
1,Handbook of the Fabulous,"Silly book, fluff. Really does not tell you how to authenticate a Hermes bag. Waste of my money."
1,Handbags of the Fab-,I honestly think that this book was a waste of my time and hard earned money. It offers no information that a Hermes Handbag owner does not know.Would not suggest this to anyone.
1,Handbag of the Fabulous,After receiving the book I was informed the author is selling fake Hermes bag. So I found the book to be a huge disappointment.
4,VERY NICE INTRO TO HERMES....,"I had not realized what the birkin was and how important it is to some until I read this. Quite interesting anecdotes, useful advice. I guess for those who are ""experts"" on Hermes, this might seem too elementary, but for someone just learning about it or who knows only some, it is great.I highly enjoyed reading it...the book was a perfect size for an intro to Hermes and birkins. However, I cannot afford these bags, so I'll have to take everyone's word on how wonderful they are in person.I can only hope the author writes another one and moves into offering more photos and more examples of just bags. It's nice to know how to buy online safely, but photos and descriptions of these bags alone would be a great followup."
5,BOUGHT FIVE...THAT IS RIGHT...5 HERMES BIRKINS FROM HALEY'S COUTURE AND ALL ARE AUTHENTIC...SHE IS AN EXPERT WITH THESE BAGS,"YES, I BOUGHT FIVE HERMES BIRKINS OVER 3-YEARS FROM HALEY'S COUTURE AND DEALT DIRECTLY WITH THE OWNER ONLY FOR EACH TRANSACTION. ALL OF THE BIRKINS ARE AUTHENTIC...ANYONE THAT SAYS DIFFERENTLY IS PROBABLY EXPERIENCING BUYER'S REMORSE OR IS JUST A JEALOUS COMPETITOR. I HAVE PROOF OF MY PURCHASES WITH HER AND HALEY'S COUTURE.FROM READING THE BOOK, I USED THE AUTHOR'S EXPERTISE IN SELLING THESE BAGS AND RESOLD 2 OF THEM MYSELF TO SOME FRIENDS.I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR ANY ENTRPRENEURS OR CASUAL RESELLERS...IT WILL GIVE YOU SOME GREAT IDEAS ON RESELLING AS WELL AS BUYING. I FOUND THE AUTHOR'S ACCOUNT OF HOW SHE WAS INTRODUCED TO HERMES BIRKINS AND STARTED TO RESELL THEM INSPIRING. DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT...GET THE BOOK YOURSELF...IT'S A GREAT TEN BUCKS!!!!!!!"
5,"America, why we should all love her...","This CD is for anyone who ever got goosebumps listening to a Souza march, The Star Spangled Banner or America The Beautiful. Do you miss the days when you started the school day with The Pledge Of Allegiance? Do you get a lump in your throat when you see a flag wave in the sunlight? This one's for you.Moreover, it is for the youth of today who don't understand that this a country worth fighting for, even dying for. It is for the jaded who see America as sneaky politicians, taxes and bureaucracy. Listen and feel American Pride."
5,A good statement on Americans,"John Wayne talks about his love of the beauty of America, it's people, history and culture. A good patriotic CD."
5,CD Condition,This John Wayne CD is in great condition and the company provided great service. I received this CD within a week of ordering.
5,"America, Why I love Her",I think this is one of the greatest recording ever made I think every American needs to hear this every day and have it in their collection . This album lets you remember who we are no matter what .
5,Another hit!,This was a Christmas gift and he kept asking where in the world I had even found this one. He was very pleased. Thank you.
5,I love the Duke!!!,"Track 8, The Pledge of Allegiance, should be listened to by every grade school class. We need to keep American Exceptionalism alive."
4,Patriotism alive and well,I originally purchased this as an album years ago. When I heard that it was available on CD of course I had to have it. The CD reminds everyone why America is America
5,"America, Why I Love Her","In typical John Wayne style, he talks of all the pride and reasons he loves America. We owned this album on original 8 track tape and are estatic that it was re-released. Especially in these times, this CD will touch the hearts of many Americans. No one with even a little pride in this great nation will come away with less than goose bumps and a sense of oneness. A great album then and NOW>"
5,A Must Have Patriotic Album,This is a must have album to include in your patriotic collection.I got this cd for the title track Why I love her but all of these sound great.Most of these songs are done with John Wayne narrating and music and background singers in the background.All of these songs are very patriotic.I give this cd heavy play along with Lee Greenwoods American Patriot during the 4th of July and Memorial Day.I'm glad they finally released this 1974 album on cd.
4,has 1 major use,we do a walk for the Memorial Day Parade for which we meet at 3AM. We got to the national cementary and listen to a special part of this and then begin walking the American and POW flags 12 miles to the parade
5,Words from the Duke,After hearing this from the Legendary actor John Wayne. You will learn more about history and the forgotten story about Taps . Then if anyone does say thisMy roots are buried here.Its a good story to hear when you find the CD and purchase it
5,How did he know?,"I still have this CD in my car since I purchased it. I've enjoyed it so much. In the songs, you can hear John Wayne's love for this country. I agree with him that America is the greatest country on earth. There are some songs which I know will offend people of today. One song is called the ""Hyphen"". The message is that anyone who uses it (African-American for an example) is a divided individual. Torn loyalties between countries. Yet, if you love and stand up for this country - call yourself an ""American"" and leave it at that.For those who have seen, enjoy and know what John Wayne stood for - will enjoy this."
5,Long waiting for this CD,"I had this record years ago on vinyl. Unfortunately I don't have anymore an ""old"" record player so I was waiting for years for one of my favourite records. Thanks to the publisher who should think over to publish other hidden ""classics""."
2,I pledge allegiance to the Duke,"The year was 1973. Patriotism was at an all time low thanks to Vietnam and Watergate. One man decided to do something about it. From out of the west came... an actor. No, not Ronald Reagan! It was John Wayne! Yes, the Duke himself. He recorded a narrative tribute (with orchestra and chorus) to America. Wayne himself did not sing, which may have been for the best. I don't know if this album restored anyone's patriotism. I admire John Wayne as an actor, but honestly, this album is kind of corny and boring. If you are more of a flag waver than I am, you may get more out of this album than I did."
4,A good fabric softener,"This product is good, but not great. I've been using it for almost a year and appreciate that it is more gentle on sensitive skin, but the scent is quite strong. I use roughly a quarter to a third of the cap in stead of the full amount to keep my clothes fresh, but not overwhelmingly lavendar scented."
5,"Works fine, scent is natural unlike those mainstream products","I've been using this stuff for a while. It works fine, and the scent is just like you washed your clothes with real lavender.It may not be 100% as soft as those chemical laden products out there, but given the reason for purchasing a product like this, it works perfectly fine. A trade off I am willing to take for the benefits, and give it five stars!"
1,YUCK!!!!!!!,"How sad and pathetic this concert is.I loved the Dolls but this dvd is so bad it almost diminshes their legacy.After seeing how good the Stooges reunion concert was I was hoping for more of the same ...wrong!!It becomes painfully clear from the start that Johanssen in particular is phoning it in.Low point of the show is when they make ""Human Being"" [one of the greatest rock-n-roll songs ever] a sing-a-long.Give me a break!!!!!"
1,Dead dolls don't play,"Man I hate to get negative when it comes to bands as great as the dolls, who in there day were every bit as cool and influental as the press has reported. This is really not the dolls though. 3 dead members and many years might make one skeptical and it should as this performance is uninspired, tired, and lifeless and a really bad idea and performance. If your an old fan you already know, and new fans looking for a glimpse of what made the dolls great had better keep looking. Crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy crummy stuff!"
2,Johansen disspointment...,"David Johansen has been one of my all-time favorites since teenage years. I just thought his voice was like a Wolfman, and his solo band for Live It Up was a revelation for me in my formative music listening years.. I have been a Johansen Fanatic all these years.. And I just got to ask.. Is David ok? Is he having drug problems? Is he sick? Is he eating right?? I saw him about two years ago for a solo show, and he looked nowhere as bad as this.. And, he gives the most lack-luster performance I would have never expected him to give.. Souless most of the time.. incoherent.. It is so sad that this performance is the one saved for posterity.. I can not sit through this.."
5,Replace at every oil change for fresh air,"I like to replace these every time I change the oil on my GMC Yukon. It is amazing how dirty this filter can get after just a few months driving in the city -- it's almost black from the particulates in the air. Don't pay a repair shop to change it, it's easy to do it yourself. After you get the hang of it, it takes 5 minutes to change the filter. My trick is to just remove one of the screws that holds the plastic access cover near the passenger's feet, and I leave the other one a bit loose. Then I give it a strong pull and rotate this plastic cover out of the way so I can get to the filter area. Just make sure the arrow on the filter is pointing the right away."
1,Product Misrepresented,"As a very old customer of Amazon who values everything we ever bought on line, I have do be frank about the Delonghi PAC600T Pinguino Water-to-Air Portable Air Conditioner. This unit looks much better than it is.However, the real problem is the gross misrepresentation about the performance and ""convenience"" of the unit. Delonghi says that there are no water tanks to empty, but obscures the fact that a water tank must be filled once or twice a day to get even minimal results. The unit ""kicks out"" at the slightest disturbance; its engineering requires the owner constantly to attend the unit for it to yield any cool, much less cold air. ""Semi-permanent"" installation is offered, but the unit will never run effectively unless permanently installed. This defeats its ""portability"". In all respects, this product is a failure and its characterization on the web is both false and deceptive."
4,keeping cool,"i have used a delonghi portable a/c for about 15 years (that's how long it lasted, so a very good investment). my model had a bucket to fill with water, which i was looking for again as it significantly increases the cooling. happy to find the pac600t. the first one i ordered, unfortunately, was damaged/defective: when i added water, it flooded my bedroom floor (amazon was excellent with the return). undeterred, i ordered another one, no problems, and am now very comfortable in this heat. it cools beautifully, even without the water. it's a bit clunky, but wheels around easily. sort of looks like a blue r2d2. it is much sturdier (made in italy) than newer models/other brands, which tend to be made in china. highly recommend."
1,What?,"I'm not sure why the description above mentions the inner city when it had nothing to do with it. Two brothers and a friend who've grown up together become hired hit man for mobsters. The conscience of one starts playing tricks on him and another one wants out of the game after a particular murder. I guess the producers of this film were trying to put out a psychological thriller but it was psychological flop. One of the actors seemed like he got high right before shooting the scenes, the annoying little sister with no acting skills that I was hope would get killed by one of the brothers, and the second half of the movie with one of the actors playing opposite himself as his conscience, was entirely too much to stand. And what does the title have to do with the movie?"
4,just what I needed,I love these towels. I was looking for an alternative to Bounty and these fit the bill. It is difficult to find them in stores where I live so I'll keep coming back to Amazon.
1,Misleading name,It says 'triple pack 3 ea' - one would think that you would get 3 packs with each pack having 3 rolls - thats not true - u get only one pack with 3 rolls. typical misleading marketing strategy. amazon - pls take note of this and change the name to 'triple pack' instead of 'triple pack 3 ea'. very disappointed.
1,"$3.33 PER ROLL, not per count",Didn't think I needed to read reviews - but I should have. Chiming in with others that it's titled misleadingly. ONLY 3 Rolls - I could have walked over to the store and bought them for less.
1,Misleading!,"I was also mislead. ""Triple Pack"" obviously means 3 in a pack and ""3 ea"" leads you to believe you are purchasing 3 TRIPLE PACKS (9 rolls) for $9.99, not $3.33 per roll...who in their right mind would pay $3.33 for a low quality roll of paper towels?? We're trying to SAVE money now throw it away."
5,Insightful and enlightening,"As usual, sticklers find flaws. We may observe that no ultimate history of anything has ever been, or ever will be, written. I found this book to be very instructive and interesting. I have yet to read a bad book by Farwell. Highly recommended for the general reader who wishes to get a better grip on modern history."
4,Unknown English Wars,"This is a fascinating book about the unknown, unsung wars that England engaged in during the colonial expansion period under Queen Victoria. It was very, very interesting to learn how the military (on the ground, not in London) used native uprisings and revenge attacks to further widen Engish colonial boundaries in the middle east and India."
3,An interesting read...but lacking important information.,"As an introduction to the period, this is a superb piece of narrative non-fiction; despite being published originally in the early 1970s, the book is decidedly Victorian in style and execution, though very approachable in styleNevertheless, individuals seeking a deeper understanding will doubtless leave feeling unfulfilled; the book lacks in certain information - dates of key battles, for example, are completely neglected, while details of said battles are sparse. The Ashanti and Maori Wars deserved more than ""also ran"" mentions. A good read, sadly falling flat of its potential."
3,I don't want to give away the plot but why why why,"My book club president sent me all 3 ""Cold"" books - I was hooked, I greedily read them all in 2 weeks time. The excellent characters and plot and plot twists had me going - I love, really love the way La Plante keeps a story going after the case has been ""solved"". I loved this book - I liked the Beverly Hills life as a background and I fell in love with Lorraine's love interest too!I cannot write anymore because I don't want to give away the plot - it was very good. I cannot say a negative thing about this or the other ""Cold"" books."
3,Easy Read,"I've read all three in the series now, and the were easy light reading. I've given three stars as I consider it an average book. Not great, not poor."
4,"Accelerates to a suspenseful, riveting, and eerie conclusion","Cold Heart, the third Lynda La Plante crime story centering on beleaguered anti-heroine Lorraine Page, starts off somewhat leisurely but accelerates to a breakneck pace, hurtling toward a suspenseful and riveting, if a bit eerie, conclusion.In this installment, we find former cop Lorraine Page opening a private investigation agency, struggling to put behind her a past of disgrace and degradation. A shadowy phone call places Page in the middle of a series of puzzling deaths.Fans of La Plante's offbeat, flawed characters and author's knack for depicting of the cruel side of life will not be let down. Mystery-solvers, however, might find themselves a bit put off by the book's random events and lack of clues.Lynda La Plante, the creator of the popular Emmy-winning Prime Suspect TV series, clearly has not lost her edge. (Reviewed by Angelo Parra, an award-winning writer and dramatist, who also writes and edits personal and family memoirs.)"
4,If you loved the others you will love this,"Cold Shoulder and Cold Blood were great books now with Cold Heart you can read more about Lorraine Page, her loves and losses. This time Lorraine is set to find out who killed Movie mogul Harry Nathan, was it his wife Cindy? her ex-colleagues at the Police department think so, but Lorraine is not so sure. Will this be the last case Lorraine will be on? read it and find out....."
1,"La Plante, how could you?","Linda LaPlante had a good thing going and blew it. Lorraine Page was a real and fascinating character, leaving the reader happily, although impatiently, waiting for the next book. In Cold Heart, the third in the Page series, as soon as Lorraine meets Jake Burton you know things are moving too fast and the plot begins to really ring false. Linda LaPlante clearly wanted to move the story along as quickly as possible and bring the series to an end. And what an end! Trite, awkwardly written, almost painfully unbelievable and a slap in the face to her dedicated fans.If you care about Lorraine Page, DO NOT READ Cold Heart...she deserves a better ending. A thoroughly disappointing book."
4,I liked it,"Wow- after reading some of the other reviews I am shocked. I loved this book. I was sad and shocked by the ending, but it didn't nullify every thing else good in the story. I am saddened that we won't have any future Lorraine books, but I am sure that Ms. LaPlante will write something equally entertaining."
2,this book is very weak.,"This book is the weakest of the three. Characters are not well fleshed out, this book just wraps up loose ends so that the author can justify the ending. A word to the wise is be happy with COLD BLOOD and COLD SHOULDER. COLD HEART reads like a plot to a tv movie of the week ... one that I would not watch!"
1,Just doesn't compare to La Plante's previous work,"This book was a real disappointment because all the real story-telling and scene-building was overtaken by melodramatic descriptions of unbelievable and unappealling characters. I found myself turning page after page, waiting for a real plot to emerge. Some of the most critical sub-plots of the story received almost no attention. In the end, the identity of the villian was of no surprise to anyone who had read the last 100 or 200 pages of the book. What happened to the suspenseful climax? What happened to the twists? What happened to the heated confrontation with the exposed killer?"
1,Cold Heart not up to the LaPlante excellence found in series,What a disappointment! Cold Blood and Cold Shoulder were such good reads. Then Cold Heart left me cold. What a stinker. The plot points rely on unbelievable coincidence that only amateur writers use. Not up to the typically high storytelling excellence of other LaPlante novels. It is so different in quality that I wouldn't be surprised to learn some day that LaPlante really didn't write this one.
3,"Could be very great, but apparently flawed","First looks: looks great, takes only little bookshelf space, good controls design (better than the other, older sony micro systems), 3 CD, relatively inexpensive (nice ""bang for the buck"")...but, as this system is only 15W / speaker, we would expect it would give a decent performance at low volume!A constant background noise is hearable from the system, for example even if the CD paused, the noise is greater when the CD is playing... The amplifier has a design flaw or it is deliberately of low quality.The ""noise"" is unbereable with headphones.At normal/high volume, this system sounds great but... I still think this product is inconsistant in quality with other sony products."
1,Don't come near this unit.,"The unit looks fine, and the gray/wood look blends in well with furniture.After one year of operation, I began noticing the hiss mentioned in other reviews. Whenever the unit is on standby (no music playing), you can clearly hear a radio station playing in the background. It's absolutely torturous. Imagine watching a DVD on a laptop connected to this device. Every time time there is a pause in the action, you hear a faint sound resembling a radio playing in low volume. If you pay attention, you can make out entire songs. If you live in an area with bad reception, you won't hear songs like I do, you'll simply hear hiss.The sound will not go away when you play CDs...you can drown it out by playing music loud enough. Unfortunately, that defeats the purpose of a bookshelf system.I called Sony, and they have no information on this problem. Stay away from this extremely disappointing unit. I purchased it for $200, and it still retails for $150. It sells on Ebay for $55."
2,"I returned it because of noisy CD mechanism, contant hiss","I bought this system for my kitchen, to provide background music during dinner.I wound up returning it, because of the background hiss other reviewers have noticed (I tried moving it to several different locations, but always had the hiss.), and because of the noisy CD mechanism. We would set it to shuffle-play 3 CDs, and would enjoying dinner, but everytime the unit switched from one CD to another, converstation stoped and everyone turned to look at what was making all that racket. (And we have two small kids, so we're used to racket.)Sound quality was good, if you turned it up loud enough to overpower the hiss (i.e full power, which isn't all that loud). I liked the small remote, and it had all the features I needed.As I mentioned, I wound up returning it, and really wouldn't recommend it."
1,piece of junk,My husband bought this for me because I had been harping for years about the giant system in our bedroom. This was small but I can't even listen to the radio the reception is so horrible. CD's are fine but the changer is ridiculously loud. He spent way too much for this since I usually just turn on my clock radio to listen to the radio and only use this unit for cd's.
1,Not for quiet places,I bought this system for background music. Unfortunately I have to agree with a previous reviewer regarding a constant static noise at low volume. I tried three different systems on different stores with different CDs and all of them seem to have the same problem.I expected more from Sony.
2,Alas...,"I purchased this system because it allowed me to hook up my turntable, and I was very happy with it. I liked the minimal electricity use, and the relatively full sound output. It had a few problems with playing some CD's, but I cleaned the CD's, and everything was fine. Now, after the warranty has run out, it's level of performance is unacceptable. When playing CD-R's, it either refuses to read them, or, when it does, can't change tracks, or plays with a thwup-thwup noise while the CD is playing (this also occurs for some commercial CD's). I've taken very good care of my stereo in the time I've had it, and I feel slightly distressed that I paid as much as I did for it, and it doesn't play my CD's. I'm going to have a heck of a time finding another stereo that has the correct hook-up for my turn-table, and I'm more than a little upset that this stereo didn't stand up to the test of time."
2,Not up to the subject,"I read about 200 pages of this, and quit when I realized that what was most interesting about the book was trying to figure out how the author managed to make Mark Twain, of all people, seem so tedious. The reader is often told how funny Twain was, but rarely given an example. The relationship of detail to big picture is shaky and inconstant. Get this from a library and skim it, but spend your time and money on Twain's own writings."
1,Shame on the Publisher,Mr. Kaplan probably worked years on this book and for what? There is no new material here and this begs the question why would the publisher contract for this book? I mean as a publisher you would want to offer readers some new information for their money insted of rehashing the same information that others books have presented in the past.
1,Warning!,"The Barbie Fashion Makeup Playset contains REAL makeup, in spite of what the product description states. It is NOT appropriate for ages 3 and up. I ordered this for my 4-year-old granddaughter to go along with her Barbie Vanity, and her mother had to take most of the contents away from her. What a total waste of time and money..."
1,"Barbie Fashion Makeup Playset with Face Makeup, Purse, and M","Barbie Fashion Makeup Playset with Face Makeup, Purse, and Manicure and Pedicure Kit is a piece of junk. it is soo ugly and stupid and doesn't work. i hate it. mattel sucks"
1,Doesn't Help With Sleep,"I did not want to go back on any Rx for a sleep aide, so Oncologist suggested something natural to help me fall and stay asleep. It's common for cancer survivors to experience post treatment insomnia. I was hopeful, but sadly disappointed as it did absolutely nothing for me."
2,Great for the expert mindstorms developer,"This is a very well written book. You can tell from the text that Mr. Sato is an expert at Mindstorms.Unfortunately, the book covers chapter after chapter of project parts and programming code that do not ship with the $200 LEGO Mindstorms: Robotics Invention System 2.0 718 piece kit. If you are really into Mindstorms and want to hand-code your programs outside the supplied GUI interface using downloaded languages, this is a great book. But, if you just purchase the Robotics Invention System 2.0 kit, then this book is not going to help much unless you download more software from non-lego web sites, and purchase even more lego hardware. I returned the book."
5,An essential reference for all dedicated Lego hobbyists,"In Jin Sato's Lego Mindstorms: The Master's Technique, software researcher and Lego expert Jin Sato offers an incredible, ""user friendly"" guide to making wondrous creations with Lego Mindstorms. Written by the creator of the MIBO robotic dog, individual chapters include computer programming and source code to craft balanced and functional assembly designs; putting together working gears step-by-step; and explicit instructions on how to create one's own MIBO or other grand projects, and more! Jin Sato's superbly presented, deftly written, 364 pages instructional guide is an essential reference for all dedicated Lego hobbyists."
3,"Dated Information, Building Examples Still Relevant","As you may be able to tell from the image this book is quite dated. It uses the older mindstorms brain. The gearing designs are still relevant, as are the building tips. If you've seen this 'dog' in motion you'll know that it's not that great as far as functionality goes. Lego gears have too much play in them to reliably operate such a mechanism over time. Don't get me wrong, this design is still very impressive. If you're looking for ways to use your turntables for robotic articulation then you should get this book."
5,Excellent for those with neck/shoulder problems,"If you have neck/shoulder problems this DVD is great! It is easy to follow with a focus on breath, pace, stretching. I would say this is a beginner level but if you are having bad neck/shoulder problems it's exactly what you want. I've tried other DVDs and this has been the best. I like it so much I just bought a few more of his DVDs!"
2,Finding the right yoga dvd is HARD.,"This one wasn't very beginner friendly. Also, the production values looked amateurish not giving much confidence in the the program offered."
5,Arrived on time. Just what I wanted,"The cd was a great addition to my Elementary grades Spanish classroom :) we will singing ""Cristo me ama"" (Jesus loves me) in no time!"
3,"Good information, but a bit dry/dull","I bought this on it's original VHS version called ""Reflexology and the living, loving woman"". I never finished it as it just bored me, and a friend wouldn't tolerate playing it even for the free reflexology. I will try again & update this review when I do.There is a short intro about how important it is to take care of your feet and how walking barefoot naturally gives you reflexology by stepping on twigs and pebbles.This is set at a patio by the beach to give a beautiful view. Anne Gillanders, a British woman w/short, curly light brown hair who looks to be in her 50s sits in a wicker chair working on a woman's as well as a man's feet on a table. Sometimes there are marker ink on their feet to show the organ areas more clearly. The lecture is split into chapters by body systems such as digestive, respiratory, etc. At the end she even demonstrates on a baby while he/she is held by his/her mother how to give reflexology on a baby."
1,This video is a joke,"I don't know when this video was filmed but it's in 4:3 format and video quality is worse than a low quality VHS tape (except the titles). This is not a DVD at all!As for the content, the technique is not clearly shown (actually I have hardly found the technique section since the menu was also poorly designed).If you are looking for a good massage videos, try Diana Haynes' titles. This video is not recommended at all."
3,Informative,"This is an informative video,and does give one the basics of reflexology with step by step instructions."
2,no wallet sized foot reflexology cards.,"The Reflexolgy massage DVD was supposed to have a wallet sized foot and hand chart included. It did not. I am happy you sent this review along as I have been with an ailing family member and did not have the time to email you prior to receiving this.Thank you for any assistance you can give regarding this matter.Sincerel,Alice Strauss"
5,Day Workers,Touching and bitter sweet story of three friends who come to America for fame and fortune but find pain and poverty. Should be given to every person to watch BEFORE they cross the boarders. Seemed a bit short but nicely and well done.
5,Totally engrossing story,"I had no idea of what to expect when I decided to buy this movie and was more than surprised at how totally engrossing it turned out to be. I liked how it managed to capture the essence of Latin families, who stick together through thick and thin. It also manages to have a reasonably happy ending. The gay character does not only NOT die, but is shown to be the most stable of the three (very good-looking) protagonists. A welcome addition to the Gay Chicano genre (try Star Maps, Quinceañera or East Side Story)."
5,Excellent!,"This film is an excellent story, that for the small budget created a good drama. It is both a story of a family growing apart and one man's coming out to his family. By far, as Gay Coming Out Story it definitely beats the sad sack which was ""Latter Days,"" it will most assuredly not depress you.Also, lots of sexy shirtless scenes from the hottest of the three latin guys, yum!"
4,Very pretty glasses.,"I originally purchased just the balloon wine glasses, but came back for the entire group after seeing them. These are very pretty, just different enough, a reasonable price, and well made.Each glass has a different pattern etched into it; could be a bonus at a party for keeping track of your drink. The stemware does need to be hand-washed - it won't fit in my dishwasher due to taller stems. Nice glasses stay nice longer if they are hand-washed anyway. The old-fashioned and highball glasses I do sometimes wash in the machine and they do just fine.If you tend to break anything glass, like I do, these are a nice choice because they don't break the bank on price and can be ordered in sets of four as you need them."
5,Very Nice!,"These glasses are beautiful! I ordered the red wine, white wine, champagne, and low ball glasses to match. I know some have said they break easily but I wash them by hand and only give them to people I trust. I had issues with the low ball glasses coming shattered but I got online and emailed Amazon and they sent another box out the same day and they arrived wonderful. Great customer service and I recommend Amazon to everyone! Thanks!"
1,A smashing present,"The gift of 4 glasses, delivered to the door of my brother's new house in Philadelphia was going to be a lovely home welcoming. Unfortunately there was very lttle packaging around the glasses and 3 were smashed on delivery. Not a good experience. I won't be back."
2,not quite,"I got this after listining to a web radio show with unsigned bands music. I must've been in a coma that night. AC/DC B sides at best with a aggravating singer. Sorry guys, don't quit your day jobs."
5,always a riot,"I used to hear Flanders and Swann on BBC TV when I was a child. This is a book of nostalgia for me. Even so, the songs are always fresh and funny."
3,Superficial and outdated,"Being a enthousiastic RC-glider pilot, I have read this book to find it a bit superficial. For instance, it pays no attention to RC Glider contest flying (like F3B), it only mentions USA-build Gliders that already seem to be on the market for ages."
4,say what you will...,"Say what you will, ""Ana Ng"" is still one of my favorite songs. It is a little heavy-handed, and it certainly doesn't make a lot of sense, but even in their least bright moments, TMBG manage to write thoughtful and singable lyrics-- well, if you can figure out what they're saying enough to sing along with them. Plus, ""Purple Toupee"" is really a kicker."
5,Very Satisfied,"I was very pleased with ""Lincoln"", it was shipped on the same day I ordered it and delivered very promptly,exceptional since I ordered it a few days before Christmas. I am overall pleased with the packaging as well as the item itself."
3,"A Good CD, but I recommend the Double Album instead.","TMBG (or perhaps I should say their Record Company) released a Then and Now Double CD that has this album wholesale on it combination with their first album. Unless you already own their debut album or are a purist, I recommend buying that one instead and save yourself some money in the long run."
5,"No, they ARE giants.","Any band that goes through the trouble of setting up a phone number where you can call up and get a song of the day is worth your $12.99.So support John and John. Help them buy a new accordian. Make sure they keep putting out records as fun and wittingly entertaining as this one. Or at least send them a coupon for a free meal someplace.I had to buy this on CD. Had to. The tape machine was so sick-and-tired of me playing this album over and over and over again that it revolted, chewed-it-up and spit it out. Now the joke is on it, because I got in on CD and I bought 100 blank tapes, so there ain't no way I won't get a good liberal dose of ""Purple Toupee"" whenever I darn well feel like it.Not for the serious-minded folk. This album is for those of us who live our lives with our tongues firmly planted within our cheeks. Yeah, that's right...I said new accordian."
2,i dont get it,"I dont get why people think TMBG are that good. Most of the songs on this are just annoying. a couple of the songs had some good aspects to them, like at one point during ""they'll need a crane"" i thought wow if only the rest of their stuff sounded like this. and ana ng is catchy and so is purple toupee and I've got a match is very good. but i wouldn't nessecarily recomend this album."
5,Easily TMBG's best,"This is, in my humble opinion, the best thing They Might Be Giants ever did -- and that's really saying something, because they've made several excellent albums. It's a typical TMBG disc in that it's funny, catchy, twisted, and like nothing else you've ever heard. ""Ana Ng"" is an absolute classic. ""Purple Toupee"" is probably the catchiest song I've ever heard, and would blow Mariah Carey right off the charts in a perfect world. John and John have the uncanny ability to make music that is completely insane, yet curiously accessible. If you want the perfect TMBG introduction, get ""Lincoln."" And then do yourself a favor: get the rest of them, too."
5,"Strangely, my Favorite of Theirs","One thing you have to realize about TMBG, there is much more to them than meets the eye, er, ear. You can not just sit back and listen without paying attention. They are neither farce nor absurdity, they are poets and philosophers.Which of these is my favorite? It's a toss up between ""Ana Ng"" and ""The World's Address"" The former is the most truthful love song ever written, and the second one is the cry of a cynic that once cared about the world and wishes it were still possible to care.It does not contain any of their few songs to have been played on the radio (Istanbul, Particle Man, Don't Let It Start), so there are no distractions from those who do not understand what they are all about.Kudos."
4,People should get beat up for stating their beliefs.,"This was the second album by They Might Be Giants. If you are familiar with TMBG, you know what to expect. Songs with catchy melodies and silly lyrics. There are a lot of great songs here. My personal favorites are ""Ana Ng"", ""Santa's Beard"" and ""Shoehorn With Teeth"". They Might Be Giants fans love this album, and rightly so."
3,Their worst is still pretty good,"I find this to be the least consistent TMBG album. The first half contains some of their best songs (Purple Toupee, Ana Ng) while the second half contains many of their weakest (I've Got a Match, You'll Miss Me, Stand on Your Own Head). Also, the version here of Kiss Me, Son of God is inferior to the original. Not the place for newcomers to start, but still a must for fans."
5,Good for the price,"The ring arrived in a prompt manner with a nice box. It was a gift for a man and came in a pink box, which I thought was odd, but still okay. It was shiny but lost its luster quickly so we cleaned it with silver jewelry cleaner and it was restored. It also started dying his finger which I have never seen a sterling silver ring do, but otherwise it was good for the amount of money."
5,Very nice ring!,I ordered this for my fiance and was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package. The ring is shiny silver and is very heavy. It's heavier than rings we had looked at in the jewelry stores. I'm very impressed with it and because it came so fast. I ordered it Wednesday night and received it Friday before noon.
5,Very shiny silver Men's wedding band,"Ring arrived promptly, photo was accurate. Ring has some weight to it, and is very shiny. Great product for such a low price."
4,Sterling Silver Wedding Band,"Look beautiful, but had to return it too small, order a thinner one in a larger size, was very please."
1,Unable to use it,"Unlike the simpliest of calendar software, this did not open to the current date nor could I set common dates. It was even difficult to switch from one to another day.A waist of money!!!!"
1,hmm...,The title was very misleading. I thought it was an actual calendar for appointments. Very misleading very disappointed!!! I will be more careful when searching for apps for my kindle fire.
2,"Informational, but not what I was looking for...","When I found this, I was looking for a free active content calendar, not a treatise on the history of our calendar...."
3,Lukewarm fusion with brief glimpses of greatness.,"Plenty of musical talent on display, but unfortunately the parts are greater than the whole. There are just four songs on the CD, and each is too long by half. While there are some great riffs and brief grooves to whet your appetite, the music just never comes together with the energy and depth you're expecting. Several times throughout the recording these guys just seem to each be on a different page.This CD was my intro to Schleigho, and I'm thinking I heard a very good band on an off night."
1,Heretical,"This anti-Biblical work is pure conjecture by the author's own admission, and should be treated as such if one must read it at all. Believers in Christ, however, should be warned that the premise of this work rests on ancient heresies condemned by Biblical believers and the Fathers of the early Church. The author has completely succumbed to those subtle and false teachings denying the full humanity and divinity of Jesus Christ, which Christians are explicitly warned against in I John 4."
1,Bizarre paranoia,"Peter Wagner appears to be afflicted with a rather bizarre form of paranoia. He sees the world controlled by a demonic force he calls ""the Queen of Heaven."" He sees this demon in everything from ancient Moon goddess religions to Islam (e.g., the crescent moon), to environmentalism (Gaia), feminism, witchcraft, and even in mainstreem Christianity (e.g., Catholic respect of Mary as the Mother of Jesus). That's the purpose of the book, to help you, too, see that all these disparate religions are really united, and that the Virgin Mary is the demon behind it all.Sadly, many people take him seriously."
1,"""...deceiving, and being deceived.""","'Confronting The Queen of Heaven' ranks second only to the movie, 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'"
4,FABULOUS bag!,"Love this bag! Lots of smooth, shiny buckles and white stitching. The pleather is crackled,which looks great. The lining is a pretty pale blue and the closure strap has a great sewn-in magnet on either side. The top buckles have an additional hole to loosen the sides of the bag. Great detailing on the handles with silver rings and studs. I would've preferred longer handles, but that's the only downside. Fast shipping, too-I got it in 5 days.A bold, super gorgeous bag!!! Well worth the money if it wears well. I hope it does."
5,This Is A Must In Every Home,"I have been buying a certain bath mat now for years! I noticed the last one I bought was different. It said "" soft cushioned cups"" After using it and almost falling, I called the company and told them "" this is an accident waiting to happen!"" I was actually holding onto the top of the shower while the bath mat moved around! I read the one review on the Safety Bath Mat, and that convinced me to order it! It's more than I am used to paying for a bath mat, but believe me, It's worth it! The Safety bath mat is sturdy and stays in place. It has lots more suction cups than my other one! I am very glad I orderd it! I am a senior citizen and can't afford to fall, expecially in the bathtub!"
5,What more could you ask for?,"I got this bathmat because my 1-year-old loves standing up in the tub, as much as try to keep him seated. I love this bathmat because it's almost the full length of the tub, it doesn't move AT ALL, and the top doesn't get slippery. What more could you ask for?"
2,Purchased because of positive reviews; Do not agree with them,"We used this bathmat for 10 days. The surface is too smooth and our feet tended to slip. Plus, the mat does not grip securely to the surface of the tub, and wants to float whenever you run a bath. After giving it a reasonable ""breaking in"" trial, we went to another site and bought a extra-large Rubbermaid mat, which has more than met our expectations."
1,trash,This a terrible product. After several tries I could not get the mat to stick to the tub. Took my shower slipped in the tub....was so upset I just threw the mat away!!!!!!!!
2,My son-- the rising star.,"I bought this movie because my son, Devin T. Quin, is one of people in the movie filmed at the San Diego Comic Book Convention.It was interesting to get some insight into the convention scene and how new comers try to market their work.The movie itself was mildly funny.The best aspect was seeing/hearing/learining about some of the comic industries legends and history."
3,An informative overview,"Bought this as a gift for my son-in-law, who's a comic enthusiast. Watched some, but my personal interest in the subject is very limited."
1,Maybe I expected too much,"I am big fan of the Spinal Tap-Waiting for Guffman-etc. movies and had a lot of hope that Comic Book - The Movie would be a cool addition to my collection. After watching, I am disappointed. There are some funny moments from time to time and Mark Hamil, Donna D'Errico, and Tom Kenny (and his family) are pretty good. The movie doesn't have enough of a story to keep me engaged between funny moments. When the funny moments arrive, they aren't enough to compensate for the rest of the movie. Would I buy it again? Probably, but for less than $10. Get this one used - I'd bet a lot of copies will be in the used video bin in the very near future.In closing, I think Mark Hamil showed a lot of promise here and I hope we see him do more funny stuff."
2,COMICBOOK THE MOVIE? More like COMIC BOOK the wasted $25.00!,"I went into this expecting so much more. But I must say, Mark Hamill really let me down. He loves comics and poking fun at others including himself? Yeah right! There was money to be made so he jumped at the chance to appear in this movie. It was very dissappointing :( I must say HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN. Save your money."
4,A fun 'insiders' look into the world of VO Actors,"The 'plot' was fluff, but seeing the faces behind the voices of some great animation was priceless. Jim Cummings known to millions (billions?) as Pooh passed out on absinth? Worth the ticket price alone!"
1,Very very bad. Fails!,"This switch is very very bad. Its fans are loud beyond belief. Our company bought our first about a year ago and it failed after 6 months. Now, 6 months after we recieved a replacement for it from D-Link it has failed again. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
1,Worst POE Switch ever,Im on my sencond switch already. The first one died abount 6-8 months after I got it. I RMA'd the device. Got a second one from Dlink. It just died on me 2 weeks ago. About 6 month life span. This PoE Switch is the worst i've seen. Noisy beyond belief and they crash after 6 months. DONT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!
1,This switch WILL FAIL!,I have had this switch replaced twice now. It WILL FAIL! Stay FAR far away from this switch. The quality is HORRIBLE. And its LOUD!
3,3,"They are not the best,meaning there are a few things wrong with them. The waist is sooo... high on these pants. I've had other scrub pants and they fit alot better. The seams were only sewed with one single line stitch. Nursing scrub pants need to be made better. I've said my peace, now I'm better. Pam Vehrs"
5,**Correction of previous review**,"Just a note to my previous review, there was a change to the final tracklisting. The mixes included on the CD single are the Original and Airscape mixes, as well as the radio edit. It still deserves 5 stars strictly for the original, and after hearing the Airscape remix on the CD, it seemed better than I had previously thought."
4,An Excellent book on Livebearers for the money,"The author is quite an expert on livebearers and his comments frequently appear in the ""livebearers@aquaria.net"" bulletin board. The book contains good, current information and expert advice, along with both good drawings and good photos. However, every now and then something is ""lost in the translation"" - lyretail swords, for example, are referred to as ""dragon swords"", a name not used here in the US. This is, however, an excellent buy for the money!"
3,Better can be found,"If you are a new fish keeper don't buy this book for the setup tips. If you are looking for a book about live-bearers the sections about specific species are good and can be helpful but the other sections on care and aquarium setup are lacking.I would suggest a more comprehensive book that can be used as they advance through the hobby. I've seen several more comprehensive guides to get someone started, and I've found the Aquarium Atlas series by Baensch to be helpful in species selection and even the sections on setup and equipment are good.CONCLUSION:Buy this book for the info on live bearers, if you want info on other aspects of fishkeeping as well, look elsewhere."
4,Informative,"This book had lots of good information on live bearers. I think it's an excellent source to start out with. If you are looking for very specific information, this may not be the book for you. I was really looking for some Platy specific requirements that don't necessarily include breeding, and other than a short paragraph, there wasn't hardly any information tuned especially for Platys. That being said, It's a great starting place for breeding live bearers. The pictures of Guppies & Mollies were lovely. The fish illness discriptions were well written. But you should not use this as your sole source of information on these types of fish."
4,Book surpassed my expectations,"This book was helpful for me, as I am learning how to breed and care for mollies, guppies, and platys. It was useful in identifying and treating diseases, perfecting my tank, and recognizing the sexes and different types of live bearing fish. The photos are also spectacular"
4,Mollies,"This book was helpful, but did not have as much on Mollies as I hoped. It still is packed with lots of good information."
4,How to share your faith Greg Laurie,Thbook was in new condition as advertised. You would never know this was a used book. I have read it and gave it to someone else to read who wanted a copy but could not afford one.
2,Doesn't live up to 10 Real SATS,"This book while providing one example of each SAT II subject test is not nearly as comprehensive nor as useful as 10 Real SATs. With so many tests in one edition, there is little information on each test. Also, with only one practice test per subject, after you familiarize yourself with the types of questions you're already out of practice material. I don't recommend buying it, but if you're going to take the regular SATs I definately reccommend 10 Real SATs for your review."
1,Outdated edition!!!,"I purchased this book to help my child decide which Subject Tests to take next year. This edition still includes the English Writing Test which is no longer an option. This edition was published in 2000, which makes me wonder how current the test information is. Don't waste your money."
3,dvd skips,I had this for 6 months and now the DVD skips all the time. I hope they replace it no hassle.Other than that its really great.
3,MAG MRD20037 Magnavox DVD player,"I bought this unit and i was surprised find out that it has a great audio, nice bass, however it lacks treble and bass controls. I had to replace the unit due to problem with the power unit a week after I purchased it, now afer 3 months it skips some dvd's during playback. Also, the fan makes alot of noise for its size."
4,Inexpensive value,"I went shopping for a decent DVD player expecting to pay up to $200. I was surprised to discover an entire home cinema system available for less. It was easy to assemble but more importantly, the sound options coming out of this system kicked butt. I enjoy a wide range of musical creativity [Sneeker Pimps to Bach] as well as DVD diversions. This system stepped up to the job. I just hope it lasts."
3,Question,"Hi i dont have the product but im really intersted on buying one, so i would like to know if anybody can tell me if the DVD is a Multi-Zone DVD or if is not. Thanks for your time"
2,disappointing,"The handles on these knives, while having good balance, are the weak point. These knives aren't meant to be thrown. After minimal use they broke - at the handle."
5,One of the most compelling plays of all time!!!!,This was probably the best play I have ever read. Eugne O'Neill was at his finest hour. The use of illusions and paradox brought out the true meaning of this play. It is a must read for everyone!!!!
4,Compelling drama,"""The Iceman Cometh"" is a four-act play written by Eugene O' Neill, an American playwright. It's the story of a group of alcoholics who struggle to retain a broken dream. They are visited by a salesman, who tries to change them, and teach them some lessons about life. What happens from there is for you to find out, as the reader!The play is excellent. Great characters, although they aren't characters you would want to hang out with. The dialogue is sharp and the play builds to a strong climax. This was my first time reading Eugene O' Neill and I must say I want to read more of his work."
3,Read 'Death of a Salesman' instead,"This was an ok play, but I don't understand why so many people like it so much. It was interesting and somewhat entertaining, but it was incredibly depressing and almost nihilistic. The people in the play sit in a bar all day and don't do anything. As a matter of fact, they don't even try to do anything. This play is similar to Arthur Miller's `Death of a Salesman' in the respect that both plays are sad and depressing, but Willy Loman in `Death of a Salesman' is a good, family man who is at least working hard and is at least trying to improve his life unlike the complete bums and pathetic losers in `The Iceman Cometh'. Save your time, skip this play, and go directly to `Death of a Salesman'."
1,HORRIBLE PIECE OF NONSENSE,This may very well be the worst creation of man. Do yourself a favor and buy the new Limp Bizkit album instead.
2,Almost Useless,"Unlike most other Examples & Explanations Series, this one is one of the worst I have read. Authors waste too much time on history of criminal law and MPC, and very little time explaining the law. Common law and MPC are not distinguished and characterized well, and no clear conclusions of law are given. The example are very plane, without exploring the variety and complexity of real-life problems. Unbelievably, only 35 pages are spent on homicide, the most common and complex problem in criminal law, and the examples and explanations for homicide are terrible."
2,Don't buy this book unless it is required....,"I was required to buy this book for my criminal law class (which should have told me something about my teacher). I find that this book really just restates the same thing the casebook says, but without including cases. I want plain language explanation and law.I do not recommend this book. I did try Dressler's Understanding Crim Law, and really like it."
5,Improve your sex life!,"Little thing, big climaxes. Strong vibrations give me the most amazing orgasms. I recommend this item for everyone! I use it during intercourse because I just can't have a g-spot orgasm. I use it to help achieve clitoral orgasm and my husband says he can feel powerful contractions that make him come harder as well. I still have my horribly expensive LELO vibrator which I love as well but this cheaper vibrator is smaller and stronger. Excellent!"
2,Fooled by the good reviews,"I'm sure this item works as designed, but the reviews make you think it is better than sex. Wrong. This is the very basic vibrator, no flash to it. Whoever thought it was all that obviously never had sex before. Disappointing. Spend the extra cash and get the vibrator with pulsating features, different speeds and intensity, and the motor placed mid shaft; you won't regret it."
2,Yeesh!,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. Just tastes bad, don't know how else to describe it. Sorry, but I couldn't even get through one bag. Oh well."
5,love these!,"I love all of the Just the Cheese snacks. They can be a little salty, but otherwise, they are a yummy crunchy snack. There is a bit of an oily aftertaste, but even my kids don't mind that, they all like these as well. I love the fact that there is no soy (so bad for you!), no gluten, and pretty much just cheese. For anyone looking for a crunchy snack that is also good for you, try them. (and natural fats are good for you! don't fear natural fats. you should avoid man made processed fats, like in most snacks)"
1,Wrong move here!,"Doesn't really taste like cheese. It tastes like burnt cheese. Try this before you buy. Put some cheddar cheese in a pan and burn it. Don't just fry it up, burn it. If you like that you might want to try this. The flavor would be comparable but remember the texture will be different as Just the Cheese Rounds are much drier (not greasy)."
5,A Modern Day Classic For Neurology,"It is clear much care has been taken in the writing of this text.I am involved in medical student teaching and this book has been very useful. Neuroanatomy and related topics has always been a bit difficult for many students and this text puts things in a concise,thourough fashion.I have also used it personally on numerous occasions to help review some relatively uncommon clinical scenarios."
4,Actually Good,I was a little woried about this when it was originally released so I was a little hesitant on spending the hard earned cash> I found it fairly cheap on here so I picked it up and I was glad I did. I'm not going to go into detail about every track on this but if you like power metal you should check this out.
1,What Happened,None Of These Tracks Are Original Recordings. They Were Recorded In The Early 1970s. Apparently The Other Viewer Who Gave This Album 5 Stars. Did Not Read The Booklet Inside. Giving Potential Buyers False Information. Take It From Me Don't Waste Your Money.
1,Chubby's originals are STILL absent!,"For some reason, Allen Klein of ABKCO has STILL not released the original Cameo-Parkway masters, so all we STILL get are these horrible re-recordings of Chubby's best hits. Fortunately for me, I've got most of his hits on vinyl for me to enjoy."
3,"Enjoyable, But Not History-Making","A witty and entertaining play, marred by straw villains, political correctness, and too great an indulgence for man-boy love. It won't last (none of Bennett's plays will last) but for the most part it passes the time agreeably."
4,"Different from the script in the ""The History Boys: The Play""?","Does anyone know if there's a difference between the scripts included in the books, ""The History Boys: The Film"" and ""The History Boys: The Play"" books. The ISBNs are 0865479712 and 0571224644, respectively."
5,Good read,Really well written play. It confirms my views of the world and the British system of education.Recomended for the visual reader.
4,education vs. learning--poignant,"Through the characters of the 4 teachers (Hector, Irwin, Dorothy and the headmaster), the author presents interesting and relevant questions about the purpose of learning vs.functions/applications of education, and about the place of true philosophy in its original meaning (love of wisdom) in the industrial and competitive societies. It is such a poignant book, particularly in our American educational system where everything is attached with adollar sign, and selections of institutions and educational materials are potential investments not only for students but also some of the schools to which names of prestigious colleges are their marketing products. The sexuality (and homosexuality) in the play is obviously a relavant developmental subject, however,I felt that it was presented rather disjointed ways, even perhaps, subtlely self-serving to the author rather than to the story."
4,Love this book,"Cuts through all that New Economy hype and gives you the real deal. A wonderfully easy book to read, understand, and immediately use to drive competitive advantage and concrete business improvements.Highly recommended to anyone looking to jump-start their organization's use of technology."
1,Spooky,"This video has not one thing to do with natural childbirth, it is a very spooky political diatribe. Male partners seem to have little if any role in the birth process. As a couples we looked to be educated by this video. We learned we had wasted money. With some people the video could help create fear of the medical community , there by potentially endangering mother and child . Information is power for expectant parents, I advise you to find your power elsewhere."
3,Not a real history of longboarding!,"After buying and reviewing the movie I would have to say that the producers and writers missed their mark as far as the history of longboarding goes. It starts out with a black & white glimpse of old time wooden longboarding and then on to the typical surf movie stops around the world of the boys having fun at these various locations and fails to give anything substantial about the history or any detailed equipment evolution(board design, materials, shaper & design philosophies,etc.). Some of the footage is awesome, but most of the time it was too short at given locations. I've seen better!"
5,A great surfing film on for everybody,"What makes a surfer a surfer? What with surfer culture? Where did it come from and where is it now.Watch this movie and answers all these question and more. With great footage of all types of boards and styles, from all different places over the world, this film is delivers. The soundtrack perfectly matches this movie and enhances the storytelling and doesn't over power the narrative or footage. This is one of my favorite surf flicks.For non-surfers I think it will keep your interest and give you insight into the surfer culture and the different element within this group."
5,"A very informative, but easy, read.",An excellent overview of the Fauna of StellWagon Bank. It includes many wonderful photopgraphs. There is also pretty balanced account of some of the significant environmental issues effecting the bank.
5,Perfect!,"I ordered this product for a friend's birthday present. It arrived even before the expected delivery time, and the product was in pristine condition. It also has a nice woody smell to it. I would definitely recommend this product and seller!"
5,Great listen!,"I really enjoy this CD. It's about the same level/tone as ""Use Your Voice"" which is my favorite album by Mason Jennings. The song ""Little Details"" (#6) is my favorite :D"
4,Excellent Acoustic Ablum,"If you like any of Mason Jennings new music, such as the album Boneclouds, then you will enjoy this album.It is gritty and raw, featuring a much more intense emotional side of Mason and will leave the listener moved on several occasions.So good."
5,Hellhounds Greatest Hits,"For those of you like me who thought the Hellhounds (the Sats minus Dan Baird, sorry Dan) were a better band than the Georgia Satellites, this is the record for you. It's basically covers played like they owned 'em, which is the way a cover song should come across, right? This record smokes from the first track. ""Hand to Mouth"" is one of the great Satellites songs - it should have been a hit. I bought the same record as an import from Denmark a few years ago. Glad to see it's easier to get now. Pick it up!"
5,Listen and smile......... a lot!,"This has to be one of my favourite albums of all time. Sure, it isn't complex or musically clever - what it is, is pure fun. If you want a pick up then this is your album. I only saw the band live once at the Town and Country Club in London in 1989, a gig that has never been bettered in my view. It was beautifully summed up by the rows of fans ringing out their tee-shirts into the gutter at the end of the night!"
1,very cheaply MADE,"I was looking for a diaper baby was convenient and easy for me to manage with my 1st baby on the way.I placed it on my wish list for my shower. I received it at my babyshower and was really excited because I loved the fact that it was a backpack. I want to say I had the item about 2 months when it plastic pocket tore from the inside. At 3 1/2 months the straps started to unsew and by the 4th the strap buckle(also plastic) broke and I had to thow the bag away. I thought that for $35 dollars it should have lasted me much long than that! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE, IN FACT I WILL NOT PURCHASE OR ASK FOR ANYTHING FROM THIS BRAND AGAIN. I WAS VERY UNHAPPY."
5,Fun Movie,"The movie 'Monkey Business' is a lot of fun to watch. Although it is a black and white movie, it has a lot of action in it that keeps your interest throughout the movie.The basic plot of the story is: A chemist (Cary Grant) is trying to come up with a formula to stop or slow down aging. He tests his formula on monkeys and one day while the chemist is out of the lab, one of the monkeys gets out of it's cage and mixes together a successful formula. The monkey takes the formula and dumps it in the water cooler. Whenever anyone drinks from the water cooler, they revert back to their childhood and act years younger. Some of the scenarios are pretty humorous!This movie is great for watching with a friend if you like old movies and need a good comedy. Make sure to have lots of popcorn nearby!"
3,vacation preview,"I'm going to Zion national park on vacation, I purchased the blue ray to get an idea of what to look for and it didn't disappoint me, it done very well with beautiful video of the park."
3,Mixed Bag,"Some nice videography mixed with some ancient videography, came across a little too much like an advertisement where they where trying to sell me something for 19.95 - but it did have some nice parts."
3,Worth checking out if you love the National Parks,"The Blu Ray has a good overview on Zion and Bryce. I really enjoyed the fly overs and also the close ups inside the parks. They give a good description of the park highlights and are very informative. I was also happy with the picture quality. It was crisp and clear and looked amazing in Blu Ray.I am only giving three stars because there is an issue with the audio. The narrator sounds fine but the sounds gets very quiet when they have an interview. It sounds like they are far away from the sound recorder. This may be an issue with my setup but this Blu Ray is the only one with issues.If you love the national parks and want to get a good overview, then pick up this Blu Ray."
3,A 3.5 star book,"Actually, this book turned out great. I wish Amazon lets us rate it as a 3.5 I was really surprised this was a good read. Regina calls Marcus her dragon. He's possessive and very manly. She has dyslexia and can't read but somehow learns. Definitely recommendedBook 2 of The Royal Brotherhood Trilogy"
4,The London Season in 1814,"'To Pleasure A Prince' by Sabrina Jeffries is the second novel in The Royal Brotherhood series. The Royal Brotherhood are the three bastards of Prince of Wales. They decide to work together to better their lives. This story is of Marcus North Viscount Draker the Dragon and Lady Regina Tremaine. They decide to fake a courtship to help their siblings. Both characters have lots of baggage and it makes them very enjoyable. The story will have you laughing, smiling and dreaming of living in 1814. I would suggest all of the Royal Brotherhood Series, `A Loving Scoundrel' by Johanna Lindsey or `When We Meet' by Victoria Alexander."
3,"It was good the first 1/2, but it got really annoying...","Draker was the biggest jerk that I've ever encountered in books... He was always determined to win everything... Regina was headstrong, independent, but there were times when I didn't like her at all. The book was really funny and interesting in the beginning, but in the middle of the book, I was so annoyed with all the characters, I just skipped to the end... It had it's moments, and the end did make up for it, that's why it gets three stars instead of two."
2,Way too melodrama,"I do realize that historical romance are typically a bit melodramatic by nature, but I just found this one to be way over the top. The characters were flawed in their own ways, and as a results of these personal flaws were always jumping to believe the absolute worst in their counterpart and themselves, because of course, no one could truely love them for who they are. There seemed to be no shades of gray. I made it through the book but it was a struggle. Bottom line -- not memorable and totally skippable."
2,I couldn't connect with the heros,"***spoiler warning*** I couldn't really like Marcus because he was behaving like a... hm, well, should I say like a spoiled child for the first part of the book? He insulted everyone in sight, made totally inappropriate remarks, and then went on fuming about how nobody liked him. Well, that's a surprise. Try being nice to someone for a change. Then he made a 180 turn, completely changed his appearance and his behavior and voila, he was the toast of the ton. Meanwhile Regina (I really don't like this name) was just not that interesting a character. Her dyslexia overshadowed everything else about her. Then the way they kissed and groped each other at every opportunity. And the sudden decision that they will marry. Blah. Just not believable. I don't really think anything could work between them."
5,Love it...,"This book is great and I can't wait to read it again. I love the character Viscount Draker because I think that it is hott when he is all like tough and a rogue. I like that he thinks that he is a beast and what not I find it attractive, eventhough it is sad as well. Especialy the way his mom treated him. And I think that Lady Regina and Viscount Draker are a perfect pair and the life that they lead are great. An awesome book. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Another Great One,Once again Joy has written another great art book for people of all ages! it makes a great gift or just a fun read! i have been reading her books for years and still love the creativity she puts into them! Read it for your self and see what you think!
2,I want to save the earth but not be stinky while doing it,"I wanted to give this product a try because like a lot of people I'm getting more conscious about what my life does to the planet. I figured that if this item is as good or better than the standard stuff that I would switch.Unfortunately I found that this detergent is not as good as the standard detergents at removing oils and odors. In fact, sometimes I could not even tell I had washed an item because they were still stinky in the places where one would not want a washed item to still be stinky. In my life that kind of performance just isn't going to cut it. My apologies to the 7th generation to come but for now I'm back to the standard stuff."
1,SLES,"I love Seventh Generation for diapers and baby wipes but just found out that their cleaners contain SLES (Sodium Laureth Sulfate), which is related to SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate)."
1,"Great concept, poor execution","This camera caught my eye because of the small size. Unfortunately, that's about all it has going for it.In bright sunlight, the pictures it takes are bright and vivid. However, in overcast or even brightly lit indoor conditions, it just doesn't perform. The poor medium and low lux performance of this camera makes shots under these conditions too dark to be useable, and no amount of digital adjustment will fix them. Because of the need for extremely bright light, its' utility as a web cam is nearly useless.The manufacturer chose to use a manual focusing knob as an alternative to fixed focus, but since you can't see the focused image, it is all too easy to wind up with blurry shots.Battery life is advertised as 10 days. Even with no photos or video stored, my battery life averages only 2-3 days.This camera is being returned tomorrow. Even as a low priced camera, it just doesn't do the job."
3,Aiptek Mini Pencam 1.3,"This cam is really nice but there is a downside. The button for taking pics is very fragile. I tried calling Aiptek customer service to get it repaired but so far no respond from them yet (I just bought it 5-2-4, it only lasted for less than 30 days). I called and e-mailed Aiptek again, but still no respond. This cam is quite a deal but mine is broke right now so I am really really piss off. Can someone help me get this cam fix, since it is still under Manufacture warranty."
1,POS,"1 star only because you can't opt to choose no stars.I bought this thing about a year ago. I wanted a small camera to keep in my every day carry bag and figured this would be cool since it was small and cheap.I got it, loaded the crummy software, took ssome sample pictures, hooked it up to the computer and nothing. I have yet to be able to get the picture of this thing. I don't know if it's a problem with the software or the camera itself but after several attempts I just put it in the closet and forgot about it."
1,Can't recommend this camera,Even at this price the quality of the photos weren't acceptable. The pictures where so dark in a well lite room I couldn't see their faces. I liked the idea but just not the product.
4,Thought provoking...,"The Farm: Life Inside a Women's PrisonThis book is very thought provoking as it goes in detail into some of the lives of women incarcerated and those working inside the prison refered to as ""the Farm""."
1,Worthless,"The case lasted about 2-4 weeks and then fell apart. Even while it was still sort of ok, it wouldn't stay on the phone and kept falling off."
2,Rather Dry -- No maps,Each page had one activity. I did not see any maps. The description of the activity was not particularly inspiring. I was disappointed with the overall message.
1,Does NOT fit a 1997 Chevy Tahoe 4x4 4dr 5.7 engine.,"Amazon ""fit your vehicle"" guide indicates this fits a 1997 Chevy Tahoe 4x4 4dr 5.7 engine. It does NOT fit, filter is open on both ends."
1,Party Music,"I have not received the item which was surpost to be here June 29th, it's now July 9th I have called and e-mailed, but have not gotten any help. I plan to stop payment July 10th"
1,Not the real Artists on this CD!!!,I'll be more careful in the future. These are not the original artists who sang these songs. That is what I was looking for. My fault.....
1,Beware! Not the original artists!!,"This is a cheap imitation, a cheesey collection of sound-a-likes. A great frisbee!!"
2,collection piece,"While not the best piece in my collection, it was worth the purchase. The harem ladies each tell a tale of passion so the book is a series of short stories. A quick and light read, the stories are not overly graffic but lusty enough to keep your interest."
2,Not worth it.cheapo,"This Boldt Spot Lite is not worth buying. The head strap is weird like a thin girls headband which is not very ""thrill seeking"" and is not sturdy at all. There is another set of extra battery holder which holds 3 AA batteries which is very cheap as well. SO if you are looking for something you can wear outdoors with friends and can move around freely,then DON'T buy this"
5,Very nice glasses,"We have had these glasses for a 3-4 years. My husband loves to use them whenever he has a beer. I agree that they are a little difficult to wash because they are so deep, but they are worth the extra effort."
2,ok,This review is all opinion.they are heavy and need to spread hand wide to grasp these and use.I bought the Luigi Bormioli set and prefier them.They make good gifts! :-)
5,Finally a comprehensive book on this complex disorder,"Having a shy bladder may seem like a simple problem, but it is far from simple and far from easy. Doctors, psychiatrists, sufferers, and others will really benefit from this book. It describes the disorder very well for everyone to understand. It also does a great job of outlining a recovery plan which makes logical sense to the paruretic. If you or someone you know suffers from a shy bladder, this book is a very useful resource."
3,Informative,"Was interesting to know that this problem is more common than I realized.The author emphasized the need for gradual exposure to situations that have proved to be difficult. There was emphasize on a ""Pee"" buddy. At this point I find that very difficult to implement."
2,Not What I Expected,"I gave this book a 2 out of 5 stars because it relies on the ""buddy system"" to overcome a shy bladder. Personally, I expected this book to either build my confidence or to give me the necessary tools in learning how to control my anxiety in public situations. In order to overcome paruresis, this book expects you to have/know someone who is willing to go out of their way each and every day. I am a 21-year-old male, I still continue to battle with the same issues that I had prior to reading this book. I'm not saying that this won't work for you, but just be aware that in order to follow the step-by-step guide provided you will need a ""buddy""."
1,Not worth the paper its printed on,I read this book and found the advice in it to be a joke if anything my syndrome has worsened since reading this book
1,CODENAME PANZERS I & II BUNDLE is REALLY what you want!,"Yes I AM 50yo but I am playing my games on a 52"" TV/Monitor. EVEN SO, everything required waaaaaaaay too much management to get things done. Figures were teeeeeeeny tiny to say the least. My problem is that I bought CODENAME PANZERS 1 & 2 first; I think they did the VERY BEST with this genre. Everything else seems to have just been leading up to the gold standard set by those games. I'd avoid this game."
5,One of the best versions yet!,I love this movie. It is so sweet and I love animated Christmas movies. I just hate how fast-paced the movie is. I wish it was longer and elaborated more and I wish it was on dvd! I think Scrooge McDuck is one of the best Scrooge's I have ever seen!
4,First time buyer...very pleased!,I just received this video and was very pleased with its condition. For Only $2.00 it was in great investment and I know that my children will love it during the holiday season.
3,A Pleasant 30 Minutes,"Well, if you are planning to skip the book ""A Christmas Carol,"" and just see the video to do your paper, or take a test, I don't suggest you use this version. I would sooner use ""The Muppets' Christmas Carol,"" or even ""The Flintstones Christmas Carol"" to teach someone the story. But aside from that, it is not bad. The animation of Victorian England is well done. The Disney characters (especially Goofy as Jacob Marley) add some cute comical touches. I do not feel I would make time for this, but if you have 30 minutes to kill between Christmas duties, this is a fine way to spend it."
3,terror for tots?,"I haven't seen this movie in several years. At this point, all that I can remember is that The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come was terrifying. He comes straight out of a child's nightmare. Other than him, the rest of the movie is pretty much forgotten."
5,An avid Christmas cartoon viewer,"I give Mickey's Christmas Carol a five star rating because it holds so much value in my heart. The characters play their parts well, the story line is told in such a way that even children can watch and understand the meaning. This movie has become a family tradition for us for a long time, and I cannot imagine Christmas without watching this delightful movie at least ten times! I love Mickey's Christmas Carol!"
3,"Disney's animated version of ""A Christmas Carol""","Another animated re-make of the familiar "" A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens. This Disney offering has Mickey Mouse as Bob Cratchit and Scrooge McDuck as Ebeneezer Scrooge (of course!). The bright spot is the comical Goofy as the Ghost of Jacob Marley. A good children's holiday special. Simple enough for pre-schoolers to grasp without losing the sense of the story. Three thumbs up."
4,Autocad Dummies,Never picked up a dummies before. Really impressed with the way they breakout the non useful technical stuff. A great way to get started. Plenty of info for use later when you need it for reference.
3,DID NOT FIT!!,"I purchased these and specifically stated the make and model of my vehicle (2008 Honda Accord sedan). First, I had bad judgement thinking that they were the window deflectors for all four windows, then I realized they were only for the rear windows (hence the term ""REAR"" window deflectors. Dumb on my part, so hey, I figured I would order the front ones too instead of sending them back and ordering the pack of four together. Eventually the front ones (same brand) came and I realized the packaging stated ""2007 Honda Accord"" which has a different body shape than my car I figured the company knew what they were doing and maybe the windows of the cars are the same therefore, the deflectors might fit. WRONG!! Despite me entering my car make, model, and year when I ordered, all four deflectors did not fit. Other than that, they seemed like they were good quality, so I gave it 3 stars, meh."
3,Not Convincing,"I find this production wonderul singing and wonderful orchestral playing, but totally unconvincing. Although I love Natalie Dessay's performances, her Violetta falls short. Dessay is just too innocent, cute and girlish to be convincing. I simply can't see her being a courtesan, or a call girl, or whatever she's supposed to be in this production. And therein lies the problem with me: This ""Traviata"" just didn't do the trick. It was too modern and too sparsely conceived. ""Traviata"" calls for brilliant salon scenes and gorgeous costumes of the Nineteenth Century Parisian variety.Dessay's portrayal of Violetta's death in Act III, however, was incredibly dramatic acting. The best I've ever seen.Ludovic Tezier is another matter. To me he can't act his way through anything. His eyes are dead and his face and body movements totally unconvincing in anything I've seen him do. The voice is lovely, but..."
4,"Fair, but missing some nice spots......","I was impressived by the piano song ""bittersuite"" Zooey played in the film; and Will Ferrell's singing on the song ""I can't tell you why"" should have been in this soundtrack also."
4,"We are all born to win, but conditioned to lose.",An excellent book for people that think they have no hope. This book helps people to realize that everyone can be a winner. Thank you Mr. Timberlake for writing this book. It has been a tremendous help to me.
2,B-A-D - get Scorponok instead,"This would have been a nice toy had it been released without the awful battle station/armor/electronic sounds box. The basic robot is decent enough and nicely articulated but the vehicle mode is pretty lame, with large gaps and spaces in it. The ""powerlinx"" mode is just terrible, where all you do is loosely fit the very lightweight and incongrous parts onto the basic robot to form a dumber looking version."
3,Another history of Chicago drug use,"Bingham Dai worked on Opiate Addiction in Chicago for nine years during the heyday of the Chicago School of Sociology, from 1928 until 1937. Dai's father was an addict in China and the passionate stance taken by the author comes through in the text. As a theoretical work on addiction this is not an important work, in that Dai took the enforcement stance backed by the then commissioner of the Federal Narcotics Bureau, Harry Anslinger. The book is however an excellent empirical examination of Chicago addicts, done almost side-by-side with the famous addiction expert Alfred Lindesmith, who was also studying at the University of Chicago at that time. Dai's strength is his dogged determination for complete and exhaustive case study. It's well worth the read for anyone interested in opiate addiction."
1,Not the best for the phone,"While I certainly was impressed with the vendor selling the product and the speedy delivery, the item itself had one really dramatic flaw. The upper clamp that attaches it over the camera lens makes it impossible to open and answer the phone withough dislodging the entire holster. Not a handy feature, to be sure.What's more less than a month after receiving it, the swiveling beltclip on the back of the holster self- distructed while it was clamped to the rim of my purse. The mechanism, made up of some pieces I couldn't even retrieve, was irreperable, so I had to discard it and order another style from another company.Disappointing, and a lesson to be learned. The hard plastic, and much cheaper, models without that upper clamp are a better design. . . and the belt clip on the back must be redesigned to not fall apart within less than a month of very moderate use."
1,JUNK,This is a junk product from a junk company. I've had more than one (silly me). Save yourself the trouble.
3,Started Off Good....,"Well I was happy when I found this holster because it had the clip to hold the top in completely and not just the sides of the phone. Unfortunately, 6 weeks into using the product, the clip part at the top broke off and without it, the phone doesn't stay in the holster. This is a good product if you don't use your phone constantly and wouldn't have to take it out of the holster all the time!"
3,Works good but leaks,"There is a small in-line filter that appears to be molded plastic and it eventually fills up with sediment and then the unit spills over the top and doesn't pump out the way it did when new. I've written to DeLonghi to ask for a better filter system that can be thoroughly cleaned by the consumer without any tools. Some sort of mini-screw-on filter would be perfect. Otherwise, it is quite and well-made, but the filter is a poor design."
2,You Get What you Pay for!,"It's not very interactive, more like a e-book than a multimedia tutorial. Topics are presented with little or no info on the relationships and effects of the PS tools. It tells you to ""Select Parameters you want"", but doesn't expain how different values effect the image.The software needs to talk, clicking the FF button is about the limit of it's interactivity."
1,The best Teacher,"This is the best personal traning I ever had, to learn everthing there is to learn about photos it has help me a whole lot, best of all I can learn in the comfort of my own home. It's easy and great."
1,Don't waste your money on it.,"Don't waste your money on it. The tutorial is very basic and it does not explain even the basic information it has. In fact, you could be learning more from the Photoshop's help menu. I would not even call this a video tutorial. It is not even the recording of a real person. It is screenshots and text-to-audio software reading the steps for you. No explanation what so ever. I am regretting that I bought this product."
5,Beautiful Recording!,"I first heard the title track from Immortal Memory on uTube and knew that I had to have the CD. Of course my local music store didn't carry it so I searched on Amazon. The entire recording from Lisa Gerrard and Patrick Cassidy is amazing! Hauntingly beautiful, seductive and completely thought provoking. A great CD to play for a romantic dinner or meditation, or whenever one needs to come down from a stressful day"
2,It is so plain!,"The Immortal Memory album sounds more like a soundtrack than a music album with its fullness and uniqueness. It sounds like a part of something rather than one whole artwork. It could probably be a nice Gladiator-type soundtrack. Lisa repeats herself one more time here without inventing at least something that was not heard yet from her, while even the Whalerider soundtrack does not sound that plain. Buy it so that you would actually know what it is, but I would rather listen to the Mirror Pool or Duality one more time than this new one."
5,Embark on a deep & wide internal journey you won't forget,"Once again Lisa Gerrard brings the listener to the center of the human experience, this time by plunging us into a divine journey of life, death, and rebirth. Absolutely one of the most amazing and emotional pieces of music I have EVER heard! Be prepared to really FEEL these pieces in your body/mind. I go from chills to tears to extremely vunerable places within when I listen to Immortal Memory. On this CD Lisa sings in Aramaic, Gaelic, and 'shapes and forms' - yes, Lisa sings in her own language; therefore her voice is accessible no matter what language the listener speaks. Thank you Lisa and Patrick for sharing this important and beautiful piece of music at a time when so many are searching for depth, compassion, and personal exploration. May the listener listen with an open ear and an open heart..."
2,Disappointed Fan,"I am the hugest Lisa Gerrard/Dead Can Dance fan but this CD is very disappointing. Lisa Gerrard's voice is still as beautiful and haunting as ever. The emotion is still there. However, the lush musical backgrounds that usually accompany that voice are absent. I love meditative music, which is what this is, but halfway through it began to feel monotonous. It's as if they used the same synthesizer tone and an occassional percussion the whole way through. I cannot say that this CD is not good because it's better than 90% of the music out there. However, I hold Lisa Gerrard to a much higher standard and I hate that I have to say this is the first time I have been disappointed in any of her work."
2,"If you crave that ""Lisa Gerrard sound"", don't buy this.","I was very excited about Lisa's new album, and equally disappointed when I heard it. I've played it many times, under different circumstances, and find it satisfying only for meditating. It is rather monotonous, uninspiring, and like background accompaniment to a long sad movie, almost as though one of the tracks was left off. So, if you crave the sound that only Lisa Gerrard can give, you'll have to wait, because it just isn't here. Still a fan, and still waiting."
4,"Understated, but it grows on you","When I first received this CD from Amazon, ripped off the cover, and slapped it on the CD player, my reaction was ""is that all there is?"" My initial disappointment was based on the expectation of more dramatic and interesting vocal and instrumental arrangements. But, I've listened to the CD about ten times now and I'm enjoying it more; it is a slow and mostly mournful meditation, but it has a paradoxically soothing effect. I suspect I'll be listening to it for a long time."
3,haunting yet empty,"It is hard not to reference or compare Lisa Gerard's solo efforts to Dead Can Dance catalogue. I guess I was expecting something that would continue DCD tradition. The first thing that struck me was that the dead could really dance to the DCD music but they appear to be haunted and sorry ghosts in ""Immortal Memory"". The music is truly mournful. There is nothing wrong with mournful and haunting program for a dics, but I found those emotions falling little flat in Lisa Gerard's production. Her music sounds very ambitious but never achieves the drama and ""goose bumps"" effect of Gorecki's III Symphony (Symphony of Sorrow Songs) or Avro Part's ""Fratres"". Maybe this comparison is not fair, after all the latter two are classical music's contemporary masters, but I get an impression that Lisa Gerard's aim was equally serious. Maybe she set her goals too high."
5,A Perfect Contemplation upon Forgiveness and Healing Love,"Ever want a space -- a perfectly safe and safely perfect space -- in which any thought, feeling, desire might purely suspend itself in grace? Ever simply want something that would take the chatter and give it back as stillness? Ever need to laugh and to weep at once? Relax and attune yourself to its opening chords and prepare yourself for an allegory of life, your life with all of its loves and slights and presents. Make ready your way for gratitude. I've given this to every person I love."
2,Immortal Memory...Forgettable Melodies,"Although these compositions are characterised by pleasing tonalities recorded in richly reverberant ambiance, they are altogether lacking with regard to melodic development or musical substance. There is nothing memorable about ""Immortal Memory."" Emotionally flat, this disc is positively dreary. This CD contains 57 minutes of excessively introspective, monotonous music that inspires nearly as much emotion as contemplating drying cement. An antidepressant medication may be necessary after listening. A disappointing addition to my musical library."
3,"Haven't listend to it, but this info might help.","I haven't listened to the album or am familiar with Lisa Gerrard's work. But a number have commented that the album sounds like it ""belongs to a sad movie"", ""would go well with Mel Gibson's movie 'The Passsion'"", or that it feels like a soundtrack. From what I understand (but I could be wrong) there is an answer for all of that: The album was written originally to be the score to Mel Gibson's movie ""The Passion of the Christ"". It had been widely reported that Gerrard was hired to do the score, but that John Debney later replaced her. If that's true, what you are listening to is probably what she submitted as the score for that film."
1,Not whats pictured,The pic shows the old round top can which i wanted because the new can doesn't smell the same.Highly disappointed please sell what you advertise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Automate 5,"A very good soft for automation on Windows stations. I use it actually in the evaluation form and will buy it soon the evaluation time is over. Recommended for all users using scripts or other complicated procedures on their PC. With Automate 5 I handle all major procedures, it's very easy to use for non-programmers."
1,Junk science prevails,"While Milton isn't trumpeting the nonsense of Intelligent Design here, he is in effect attacking scientific methodology with nonsense. His arguments sound compelling so long as you don't know anything, and thus he belongs in the same box with the likes of Von Daniken and Velikovsky--authors who were either conmen or benighted fools. Mr. Milton should try using legitimate science to knock Darwinism off instead of pseudoscience and outdated ""information."" Please don't read this, or at least please try to know something about paleontology and earth history before you buy into any of what this book preaches."
1,Milton: Modern Day Quack,"I am astounded to read these complementary reviews of such a blatantly misleading book. The first ridiculous assumption one must make when reading this is that there is an intellectual controversy regarding evolution. There are many questions remaining regarding evolution, but the evidence supporting it is overwhelming. I only have a second year University education and can easily recognize the manipulations Milton makes. I will not go into details as they can easily be found by searching Google for reviews from any credible SCIENTIST. To believe Milton you have to believe that the scientific fields of Biology, Physics, Cosmology, and Geology are all way off the mark. This belief would take more than just a little leap of faith. However I am sure anyone who wants to believe Milton has more faith than they know what to do with."
1,Simple Dimple,"I started reading this book with an open mind but tossed it aside pretty quickly. In the first dozen pages, Milton shows that he either doesn't understand that mutations are the source of variability and that it is variability that natural selection works on, or he is deliberately trying to mislead his readers.He says on page 10/11 that Neo-Darwinists believe that species evolve into other species ""not because of the trivial variation that occurs between all individuals but because of chance mutations in their genetic makeup..."" Surely most people who have an iron in this fire know that it is variation that natural selection works on, and that mutations (according to the theory) provide the variation. I find the word ""trivial"" variation to be misleading, as well. It's a word ploy. I don't personally think of the differences between a Saint Bernard and a Beagle to be trivial.Charles Gramlich"
1,Get the right date Milton!,In one part of the book it is mentioned that in 1875 they discovered Neandertal bones in the Neander Valley. This is wrong! The date of the controversial Neandertal discovery was 1856 not 1875!
1,Pure nonsense,You only need to read the jacket copy to know that this book is nothing but a tired rehash of failed creationist arguments. Reading the book doesn't do anything to change this perception. Read Richard Dawkins instead.
1,This a poor book!,"1- Anyone who is a little familiar with the theory knows that it is adaptations WITHIN species and not AMONG species.2- Determining if something is transitional or not requires looking at it's anatomy, not its name. He is always claiming that fossil only show us human beings or apes, just by confusing the reader using names.3- First he say he is no criationist and he doesn't think Earth is only a few thousands of years old. He also say he has no idea about this subject and in his view nobody has it. After some pages, he try to show us there is significant evidence to a young Earth! He is so confuse in a few pages...4,5,6,7,8...you can find it by yourself if you want it, but I don't recommend this book to anyone who wants to get scientific knowledgement."
1,The usual silliness.,"A rehashing of the usual attempts to poke holes in ""Darwinism"".This book was given to me by a well meaning friend, but I find I spend more time annotating the margins about the deceptions and mistakes than in actually reading the book. For example, the chapter on radiometric dating harps on the innacuracies of carbon-14 dating (actually around 15%)and trots out an assortment of mistaken K-Ar dates, without acknowledging the millions of dates that DO accord with other evidence. Interestingly his references are nearly all from the 50's and 60's, and he is apparently unaware of dating with mass spec. The remainder is similarly vacuous and/or deceptive."
4,What's wrong with challenging Darwinism?,"I thought Milton's book was well written. There are basic assumptions of Darwinism that he challenges. Who says Darwinism is a perfect theory? Milton provides some relevant questions to the idea that every living species on this planet somehow evolved from the slime. I have real problems with Darwinism. I also have real problems with creationism. This book and others are important in that they challenge assumptions and ""scientific"" conclusions that many times don't add up. Why are Darwinists so afraid to admit there may be problems with the theory? This book is very informative. If you're interested in the subject, read it."
4,Beautiful!,"She's not educational really, or durable. But she sure is beautiful and that's what my grand daughter is in to!"
5,Share This One With the Kids,"Myths, legends and folklore about the days of the weeks are presented in an engaging style, beginning with the story of Sunday and ending with Saturday. Perl even explains the inexplicable -- Daylight Savings Time and the Uniform Act of 1967 in a simple and memorable way. Even an adult can remember it.Blue Monday (Monday was washday and ""such work would make anyone feel blue"")is defined and explained. ""Scientists tell us that, after a weekend change in routine,"" Perl writes, ""our internal body clocks are out of harmony.""This is a book that parents will especially enjoy sharing with children. There's a wealth of information here, skillfully and entertainingly presented.Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F. Tiedemann)"
4,The Enchanting La Etting!,"Although this disc doesn't focus on Ruthie's earlier successes ( like ""Ten Cents A Dance"" or ""Love Me Or Leave Me""), there are some rare treats from the marcelled diva. Campy tunes like ""It's Swell of You"" & ""Were Your Ears Burning, Baby"" get the usual crystalline Etting treatment, with hints of the Swing-era bounce coming in towards the second choruses. Gone is her little-girl sound of the 20s, and her mature torch-warbling, though by then going out of style, is at peak performance. Until someone issues a chronological Etting set, you can't go wrong with Take Two's usual pristine transfers on this release."
4,Worth Seeing Again,"The programs on the Blu-ray have been on Hi-Def TV already but the images and narration make it a worthwhile purchase. If you've never had the chance to visit Glacier NP or Banff, Lake Louise, Yoho, or Jasper in the Canadien NP system, this will probably compel you to do it."
4,Greay,"Scenic beauty is abundant in this Blu-ray disk. Well worth the purchase price, and a must if you have, or intend to visit any of the parks featured in this facinating program."
3,Mixed Results,"Some nice videography mixed with some ancient videography, came across a little too much like an advertisement where they where trying to sell me something for 19.95 - but it did have some nice parts."
1,Don't Judge a Show by It's Recording,"This is a sweet and fun show with a sweet and fun score -- it plays beautifully. Unfortunately, this recording is so bad that it actually does a disservice to the author and the material. Instead of recording the Cabrini College (?) cast, the producers would have been wiser to get professional performers in a studio for an afternoon. The vocals are under rehearsed and off-key much of the time. This effort is amateurish at best. If you are considering doing a production of this musical, please don't let this recording dissuade you."
3,Morioka makes it worthwhile,"A satisfying piece of work. Morioka's guitar work is impressive. I first heard him play on Otis Taylor's ""Below the Fold"" and love his groove."
4,The Mark by Dr. Maurice Nicoll,"Very good book, although some areas were explaned or written rather vaguely to me, but generally well worth the price and a very good read!Mike in Alamo."
5,great pictures,My husband is a model railroader and he loved all of the historicalpictures and information in this book. We bought another copy fora train friend.
3,Not much about cross-platform issues,"It's always disappointing to get a book that is one-dimensional.Here's one for you. Linux information? The word Linux is mentioned one time. Apple info? Same thing, so if you're looking for getting your wireless lan truly cross-platform compatible, this book doesn't do it. On the one hand, it's more general than that. But on the other hand, when it gets specific, it's exclusively talking Windows. So that's a minus.Beyond that, it is an ok general overview of the issues involved with setting up wireless lans, and it also has information on other wireless technologies that one might use. Most discussion is for the newbie, so if that's you, maybe this book could help. Although the way technical writing for Windows is, things always sound more complicated than they really are. The typeface is enlarged Dummies style, which is mildly annoying. Large type = little substance."
1,"Cheese Rounds, Herb 'n Garlic...",Save your money. These Cheese Rounds are terrible. Very dry. Very High in Salt...that's all you taste. I would give this a Big Zero.
2,Problems with handle,"This is a very nice looking cane, but the handle is not attached in a solid manner. There are two short round headed brads, one on each side, holding the handle on. They come out when the cane is used. It would have been better to glue the handle on. Also, the brads are placed in an area which makes them irritate the hand of the user because they are where one would ordinarily grip the cane."
5,"Hard to categorize, great music","I love this CD. I rediscovered it recently thanks to an internet video. The music here is hard to categorize but it's fantastic. Jazzy, light and awesome... with a touch of eastern folk music. Highly recommended."
5,"Great product, good service","I'm a skeptic, but over and over again, homeopathy works. Don't know why, it just does. Hyland's Nerve Tonic does what it says it does, and without side effects or mental dullness. Nothing else I've ever used is any more effective, even prescription meds."
5,Works for me,I have been using them for a few years and found the to be helpful especially when I am very tired or dehydrated. They restore my energy and especially help with vertigo or light-headeness.
2,Didn't Work,"I was excited about trying this product and thought it would work based on the other reviews, however, I felt no effects from using these tablets. I have tried taking them regularly and just occasionally, but I did not feel any different than before I started taking them."
2,"sometimes works, sometimes edgy","Sometimes this works pretty good. The problem is, when it doesn't work it has caused really bad anxiety for both my wife and I."
5,Nerve Tonic Order,"Hyland's - Nerve Tonic Tablets, 500 tabletsWhen I ordered this product, it showed that I was ordering 1000 tablets. I received only 500. I e-mailed Amazon and I e-mailed the seller [...]. I only heard back from the seller who does not help anyone out who orders through Amazon as they are not responsible for any typographical errors. They did e-mail me to let me know that they will give me a credit which is enough for free shipping on my next order. Never did get a response from Amazon.Love the product though.Sandy"
1,All hype.,"This product does nothing for me. I tried it repeatedly for over a month and every single time, i did not feel any effect. It was a waste of money in my opinion."
1,Beware the empty bottles!,"The nerve tonic did very little for me but I actually bought a second bottle for my son to try. I bought them at Wal-Mart and when I got home, we opened up the bottle (which still had the red plastic seal around the lid) and the bottle was completely empty. Nothing was inside, so I called Hyland and was told that because I did not purchase them directly from Hylands (rather I went thru Wal-Mart) for this reason, they would not help me. I was told to contact the store for a refund, even though it was clearly a filling error by Hyland. So if you purchase this product from anyone else (even Amazon) then Hylands will not stand behind their product."
2,"It was okay before, but now I've completely outgrown it.","This series of books{only the chapter books in this series} is different than any other little kids chapter books{ that I know of at least} that have black and white pictures in them. This series has not only black and white pictures, but also some color pictures, too. Not only that, but it also has a postcard on the back. When I watched Digimon before{ I still do, but not as much}, I always thought that before Kari came { or at least close to when she came}, the first season was kinda boring, and this book is definately boring. The second season{ the whole thing} was way better than this, along with the whole third and fourth season. If you're a big fan of Digimon and 8 years and younger, this book may be a good choise. But if you're not a Digimon fan, and older than 8, you probely won't like this."
5,"Hot, soaring, freewheeling live show.","Chris Rossbach composed 6 of 7 songs, and showcases his guitar talent, in this 1997 live recording. The 45-minute set soars from rock to jazz/funk to bluegrass (!) to psychedelic. An enjoyable ride."
2,Amateurish,"I only watched six minutes of this though I paid for it. On Demand features I buy from Amazon usually look wonderful but at full screen this one looked very low res and had lots of ghosts and artifacts, especially around the people. I don't think it is an issue with the streaming, I think it was filmed that way. The six minutes I watched included seeing water drops and also reflections on the camera lens itself. At the six minute mark, where I stopped watching, the filmmaker has the viewer watch a man urinating. That was enough for me. If you do plan on watching it in a little window instead of full screen. I felt were I to watch the whole thing full screen I'd have a headache and the little window is not my style. Good luck!"
3,Plot spoiler below ...,"IT'S SLOW! OK so now you know. Its not very good but I gave it 3 stars as I like movies that are off the mainstream and low budget so I gave it a break. Low budget movies with limited resources usually have a nice comedy to them that really trips my trigger but this one was lacking. Should you watch it? Prob not, but why listen to me? I wouldn't :)"
5,Fantastic,I've been looking for a CD version of this album for a while now and wasn't sure I would get the actual one I wanted. Very happy to say that I got what I wanted. This collection is fantastic. It is obvious that the singer and band were having a great time making this wonderful piece of jazz history. Love it!
1,Not Teresa Brewer,Correcting previous review: Mr Slaney rightly points out that this is not the Teresa Brewer CD nor the songs listed in your ad. Would be No stars except ANY Duke Ellington record is good.. Frank Schenck
4,Better than I could have hoped for,"I have to admit that I bought this movie because of my Joshua Jackson crush. I am happy to admit that this movie is so good! The acting in it is great, it is shot beautifully and the story line is engaging. I highly recommend this movie."
4,Great intergenerational film,Good film for younger and older adults. Many different stories going on within the movie which keeps people interested. Excellent acting.
5,Aurora Borealis,"This is one of the best, heart tugging shows that I have seen in a while. The cast is absolutely great! Joshua Jackson pulls at your heartstrings when dealing with his grandfather."
1,Very poor quality and service,"I bought a Delonghi dehumidifer two years ago because of the slick packaging. At the time I was worried that even though it looked good, it might have poor quality. My worst worries were confirmed. By the end of the first summer, the motor stopped working. To get repair service, you have to take it to an authorized repairer--there are only a couple on the East Coast. While there was one within 45 minutes--that amounts to a waster of two hours of travel, including time at the shop. Any way, the repair shop was swamped with repairing the same model. When I got it back from the repair shop, after a month, it still didn't work. Delonghi customer service told me that my only recourse was to continue to go back to their sole authorized repair shop. I decided to cut my losses at that point."
1,thought it was a CD - did not want the lp - Pat Whaley,I had thought I ws ordering the CD so was quite surprized when a lp record appeared. Pat Whaley
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM KITCHEN KRAFTS,"If I actually ever received the item, I could rate it. But I did not. When Kitchen Frafts finally decided to refund my money, they only refunded me the cost of the item, not the shipping costs I was charged. So I had to open an inquiry with my credit card.Like many of Amazon's 3rd party vendors, this one will RIP YOU OFF. Buying directly from Amazon, I've never had a problem. Buying from Kitchen Krafts, as well as other 3rd party vendors, I have never received items and have had to fight for weeks for a refund."
5,"Good muffin cups, hard to find!","I got these cups online after I searched all over town for them. NO ONE had them for sale, even though large muffins seem to be popular. I will buy these again!"
4,fabulous as usual,His emense talent and skill is perhaps best summed up by the fact that his music represents the thoughts and truly the heart of an entire people. This CD is a wonderfully extensive collection of some of David Brozas finest work yet. This box set should not be over looked and is a must have for any well rounded Israeli music collection.
5,Allergies Be Gone!,"This product works wonderfully for my cats, who suffer from allergies due to poor immune systems. Because of their association with semi-feral cat colonies, they're easily prone to upper respiratory issues, too. Viralys is truly effective to nip the allergy issues in the bud. This in turn prevents things from getting worse.It does work, thusly saving me a trip to the vet's office."
5,Great Product for Helping Control Feline Herpes Outbreaks!,We adopted our Simba last year and we later found out that he had Feline Herpes. We have 2 other cats that have also contracted it from him. I give them the gel everyday and in 1 year only one of our cats has had a breakout. This product works great in controlling the outbreaks!! Along with it we use the Comfort Zone Feliway Plug-in for cats and that helps keep the stress levels down in our home. These 2 products are great for Feline Herpes!!
1,Cats won't touch it,I did not buy this on Amazon but wish I had. I paid $20 for this size tube at my vet's office and the cats will NOT touch it. Not mixed in food and will let it just sit there if I put it on their fur. At least had I bought it on amazon I wouldn't be out AS much money. I'm here looking for the human powder supplement hoping that will work by mixing it in the food.
3,My cat's won't eat it.,I had a similar item that I received from my vet for my cat's runny eyes and nose and sneezing. My cats loved it. I thought I would try something a little cheaper and it didn't work out. My cats want nothing to do with it. I did receive this product very quickly.
5,Vet recommended,"I buy this product for my cats because my vet strongly recommends it. I know it says that they will eat it directly, but I've never had a cat that would eat anything directly. I just put it in their food and they take it that way."
2,Not such a great deal after all..,I'll preface this by saying there is nothing wrong with the supplement itself. My two cats have been on it for years. I thought it would be more convenient and I could save some money purchasing on-line versus buying at the vet's office. The packaging looks identical except for one thing - the hole in the tubes I received are huge!! The ones I have purchased from my vet had much smaller holes. I would then enlarge it just a bit with a drill in order to dispense the product into an 5 ml oral syringe. This made medicine time a much faster proposition than these tubes are turning out to be. It's messy and time consuming trying to load the syringe and I end up wasting product. I've not been successful giving it to them any other way. The product cost plus shipping wasn't less then getting it from my vet and it has certainly NOT been any more convenient!!
2,dissastified,I am not pleased with this product at all. We have two kitties who we bought two tubes for and neither of them will eat it at all. Will not buy it again and would wish to be re-imbursed. This would encourage me to seek your products again should you consider refunding this. Thanks so much!Betty
2,paste is better,"We've been using the paste version of the for awhile but got the gel last time. Unfortunately, my kitty won't eat the gel. The gel is also messier."
2,Gonna try the powder,"I have been trying to use this product for over 6 months. I used to work in the pharmacy at a vet, and we told clients that the cats will love the taste. Boy do I feel like a liar! My cat hates it, and giving it to her in an oral syringe is traumatizing her. Just ordered the lysine powder based on its reviews, hope she likes it!"
5,Perfect for my kitty,This is a great product. My cat devours it when mixed in w/his fancy feast. Excellent price and easy to get w/o a prescription. Thanks!
3,Not sure if it's working,This is something I have to mix in with my cat's tapioca pudding. She doesn't eat it otherwise and I'm not sure if she's getting enough to help her.
4,seems to work!,"I couldn't get my cat to voluntarily eat any of the ""treat"" versions of L-Lysine. With the gel, I can squeeze a blob onto her fur and then she has to lick it off (very sneaky, I know). I've been giving it too her four about a week now and her eyes already look a little clearer and sneezing has subsided."
5,Even picky cats should like this supplement,"My cats had chronic goobery eyes and sneezing before they went on L Lysine supplements. I tried the powder first, sprinkled on their food. The cats seemed to resist eating until they were starving, and their was often powder left in their bowls. I was skeptical about this product because of the price and possibility that they wouldn't like it, but both cats eat it all. I squeeze their dose right on top of their dry food and never see a trace of it in their bowls. The best part is that I have seen a dramatic improvement in their health. Both cats have clear eyes and their noses to not run, eliminating the constant sneezing. I had only seen mild improvement with the powder - perhaps because they were not getting the entire dose? I have tapered them down to every other day and still have not seen a return of symptoms. Great product. Highly recommended."
4,Only 1 of my 6 cats will eat it ...,"...but for our cats we'll do whatever works! I can't figure out 'why' he likes it though since it's nothing like the malt and tuna flavor in the Felovite II and the Nutri-Cal, etc. (all 6 of them like those!). The Viralys gel has a pronounced sweet smell very much like that of maple syrup that seems to turn the other cats off at first sniff; to my sense of smell it's almost sickeningly sweet. I don't know if they purposely add something to make it smell like that as an appetizing attractant (ugh) or if it smells like that because it's a necessary component. Either way, I'm sure my cats would be more inclined to eat it if it were made with the malt/tuna flavor."
5,Vetoquinol Viralys Gel works GREAT for our kitty cat!!!,Vetoquinol Viralys Gel for Cats works great for our little kitty cat. It's alittle thicker than the liquid we received from our vet originally & has proved to be much easier to administer. Lots less dripping & waste with this brand. L-lysine aids in reducing the flare-ups caused by Herpes. Was well worth the cost! Apparently my cat enjoys the taste because he doesn't hesitate to lick it up!!
2,Formula Changed!,"I have ordered many tubes of Viralys gel over this last year and found it made a great base for adding powder supplements to be syringed for my cats. This last order I received of 2 tubes, I noticed immediately that the color has changed to a very pale yellow instead of the orange-y color it used to be and the ""liquidity"" is now like that of thick hair gel! What is even more disturbing is that the ""liquidity"" is DIFFERENT in the 2 tubes I received! This would indicate a lack of quality control and a legit reason to be concerned about the integrity of this product at this time. 05/13/09"
2,"Maybe other cats love it, but mine doesn't","It's drippy, oily and difficult to get into my cat. I would not call this stuff a ""gel."" Zeke doesn't like it, and even if he did, it would drip off my finger way before he could possibly lick it off. Perhaps my vet made a mistake in giving me this, instead of the actual ""paste?"" Anyway, it's expensive, and I don't have time to administer this stuff to my cat 2 times a day, as I must use a syringe, tie him up in a towel, and force open his jaws. I am investigating other options, since he no longer is fooled if I mix in a crushed tablet in with his favourite treat (yogurt) either. And if I put this drippy oily stuff into anything, he won't go near it."
1,Not as palatable as the label says...,"I have a kitten that had discharge coming from her eyes and nose, and was sneezing often. My vet suggested I try Viralys, and showed me at her office how much I should use and how to administer it. We both noticed that my kitten was not pleased but decided I would try it given the vet's experience with the product. Unfortunately, it has been very difficult to administer to my cat. She does not like the taste, even when mixed with wet food (she leaves it alone). I tried putting some on her paws but once she tasted it, she left it alone. My older cat does not like the taste either. Had I known that my kitten would be so sensitive to this taste that she didn't like, I would have opted to pulverize lysine pills and sprinkle them on her food instead of spending much more on a messy gel she does not like."
1,"monkeys eat tree sap, cats eat mackrel","Cats are carnivores. Too bad the makers of this product haven't figured it out yet. My cat loves fish and chicken but won't touch this maple syrup flavored stuff my vet recommended. I donated it back to them. Sorry Charlie. Maybe you can get Mikey to eat it, however, Jake won't have anything to do with it. Jake loves Vetri-Lysine Plus Soft Chews 4.23oz"
3,"Arms thinner, but not necessarily good for sensitive skin",Works well on mobilizing excess arm fat; tightening of the skin is less dramatic.It may be hard on the skin if you have any skin senstivity. My daughter's skin remains very red after using it for a few weeks.
2,Fresh smell,I still don't know if this will work for me. Really I was expecting so much more especially for the price they sell. However they work better than the night wrap.
4,4 stars for the best tunes; loved this band,"I was knocked out by ""Gone,Gone,Gone"" the first time I heard it years ago. It never got the recognition it deserved, in my opinion. Great song, great harmonies, and an absolutely killer guitar solo.That said, I don't think most of the songs are quite as good as GGG, except 'She Don't Know' and 'Watcha Gonna Do', but that's my personal taste. This band was populated by good songwriters that could, and did, cover a variety of styles that were at home on the radio without putting you in a diabetic coma.If you're a fan of well-crafted songs, tight harmonies and good hooks, this band is for you."
2,What a let down,"So, I saw that this game was a World War Two, real-time stategy game. I am a big fan of the close combat series and I own close combat 1 through 5. This is not close combat. The manual is vague and poorly written. The gameplay is alright but it seems too cartoonish. People who like any sort of historical realism will not like this game. However, kids might like it. But,I would have been disapponted by this game even when I was ten. I have played it once and will never play it again."
1,boring!!!!!,"This DVD is the worst DvD I have. It show you the sun salutation in the most basic way, no down facing dog, no cobra,no ay other options. the first 19 minutes she expleins, the poses so slowly and bored. the 40 minutes after that,she repites he sun salutation over and over with one leg and then the other for the lunges, but what get my so upset isshe does not give you any modification so you can progres, so she is doing it always the same way.Don waste your many on this DVD!!"
3,Birth of Jesus Recalculated,"Written prior to the 9/11 attacks, the author comes up with a date for the birth of Jesus as Sept 11 in 2BC in a two hour window. What does this mean?"
3,"Cute, but not excellent","I ordered this shirt in the largest size it came in and that did not fit me well. Other shirts in the same size fit just fine. The sizes run much too small and they shrink considerably in the wash, so consider this before buying."
1,wrong battery charger,The battery charger was not the same as the one in the picture. It is a after market charger and it does not work as well.
5,Original equipment - ok!,"Delivered quickly. Product matches the original equipment that I lost in my travels. I tried other ""universal"" battery chargers, but this is the best."
5,Digital camera battery charger,I lost the original battery charger for my camera so I ordered a new one. This one works great! I was so happy to be able to find one at a great price! Without the battery charger my camera was useless.
5,Great charger,I bought this to replace my charge for my camera batteries. It is different from the one I had and I was alittle nervous ordering it. I like it better than to old one because it has a green light that tells you when the battery is charged. It has a plug on it to plug it straight into the wall.
5,Works as advertised - no problems,Not much more you can say - Works as advertised - no problems. That's what you want it to do. Mine is over 4 years old and is charging its second set of 2 batteries and it's still working. Sometimes things get a 5 rating because they do what they're suppose to and you don't notice them.
1,The one star is for Amazon,"I wouldn't know how good the actual Canon charger is, because they sent me a generic battery charger. It works, but it's not what I paid for. BE VERY CAREFUL HOW YOU ORDER THIS!!!I will recommend that if you get ANY charger and travel with it, put a string on it so you're not stupid enough to leave it in a hotel room's outlet when you leave!"
3,"Great for the tensor formalism, but not enough","Dirac does a great job at explaining the differential-geometry.The tensor calculus, parallel displacement, covariant derivative etc. are explained clearly and quickly.However, 69 pages for this theory is just not enough. I found the later part of the book insufficient. It's more of a dictionary of general relativity."
4,Good but not enought.,"This is a very interesting book for advanced undergraduate students from a Nobel laureate, but I think that it could be better. For example, it doesn't say anything about equivalence principle and it uses a very hard notation and has no examples or exercises at all!! It is much more like mathematics than physics."
4,A concise overview of the classical theory.,"In his inimitable concise style, with not a word out of place, Dirac offers a 60 page sketch of the classical theory of gtr. Doesn't cover any of the modern theoretical developments and offers not a single figure, but if you have a strong math background and very little time to spare, this is probably the book for you. No problems included, so serious autodidacts should supplement this with another text such as d'Inverno which does have problems."
5,A succinct book on General Relativity,"When I was first studying General Relativity, a graduate student friend of mine remarked that this little book has about all the information that ""Gravitation"" (http://www.amazon.com/Gravitation-Physics-Kip-S-Thorne/dp/0716703440 - THE textbook on General relativity) has in just a fraction of the pages. He was only partly wrong, and this slim volume continues to be the best summary of this mathematically challenging field. Whenever I need a quick (and not so quick) reference for one of the basic results in General Relativity, this is the first place where I look. Either as a secondary reference or the first textbook on the field, this book continues to be a valuable resource."
1,seller doesn't care,"was not pleased with product but was greatly enamored of company when I found a request for a review similar to this, which I filled out articulating my dislike for the product, which I thought inferior and my pleasure that someone cared, and my willingness to pay twice as much for a higher quality set or take a refund for the one purchased.No further communication since then and I am not greatly impressed."
1,Totally Junk,I bought these earbuds to use with my KRZR and they do not work at all.The seller should refund my money.MC
4,Great but wire is a little short!!,These are great earphones but the wire is just a little too short its not as long as my ipod wire. other wise pretty good sound quality and EASY TO USE!!! hope this review helps you!!
1,Very surprised...,"Initially I was quite surprised to find that this had such a high rating from buyers / users - but then I remembered - there is no ZERO stars rating, so we had to rate with 1 star, giving at least 120% better rating than deserved. Real garbage. Both sides do not function at the same volume (and I use the term ""volume"" here against better judgement). What one does hear sounds like cheap AM radio. What is this joke, Motorola?"
3,acceptable,"This stereo headset, for being free, is decent. You get decent sound quality, but the volume isn't the greatest. They fit in my ear fine, and I go jogging with my phone all the time. The button on the earphones is worthless, and a little bulky, so you have to clip the thing to your clothes, but I can deal with it. Overall I give these 3 stars."
4,OEM Motorola MP3 Stereo Headset SYN1301B,"The headphones work great in regular use, the microphone included in the headset makes life easier when taking a phone call while using the phones mp3 player. The only issue I had with it was while running one of the speakers was emitting noises, however after letting the headset sit for a day it started working properly."
1,Bad Service....,I would not order anything eles from this seller i order this item it did not work could not get any help so i have something i can not use.
2,bad sound + echoes,"I cant really tell between good quality sound and better quality sound, but these earphones sound horrible. THere is static, when listening to music, and the people your talking to hear echoes. It should be better to get an adapter and get a third party headset. (Though i never tried the adapter)"
1,Don't buy it!!!,"I bought this for my motorola RAZR V3 weeks ago. First impression wasthe poor quality of assembly (also the package was nothing but a paperenvelope). When I connected to my phone, it did work sometimes. However,most of time you can hear anything from the earphone. Don't waste yourmoney on this."
5,Great Product,I love the headphones that are made for the mini-USB connection. No converter or adapter- just plug and go and sound quality is great. Great price too!
3,As ordered,"These are what they are; an OK stereo headset that has a mini usb plug end. That's what I needed and what I got, but don't think that these are high-fidelity items. They're cheap OEM stock items that I would never use to listen to music all the time."
1,Not what I was expecting....,This headset is not worth buying. The sound quality is not good. It seems like it will break at any time.
1,Failed and Looked Used,"Poor quality, looked used (had a scratch on the piece where you talk into, and it failed to work in one ear after one week."
2,"It works, unless it breaks...","I was able to use this about 3 times before the answer button part broke. It was jusrt sitting in my bag and the next time I went to use it, the face had broken off. It was not designed well, and the plastic was just hanging on by 4 small posts. I'd say it has build quality issues."
2,Fine if you're short,"The product is actually fine for most uses. No, its not the sound quality of Bose earphones, but its cheap (a lot cheaper than if you were to buy a USB-3.5mm adapter and buy another pair of headphones). There is one thing, however, that makes these unbearable: the length of the cord. I'm 6'3"", and the wire is 3-4 inches too short for me to put my phone in my pocket and listen to music. If I want to develop bad posture or buy a belt clip, they'll suit my purposes fine, but how much does it cost to make it a few inches longer?"
1,Don't work,"I ordered these to work with my Sprint Motorola KRZR K1m. The phone doesn't recognize them. After 30 minutes on hold with sprint tech support, they advised me that they wouldn't work with my phone. They said you need the syn1562a or s200 (same thing). Overall I'm very disappointed in my purchase of this product"
4,Motorola Headphones,Cost of this item is very good and quality is very good. Use regularly on airplane trips and while driving. Hands free is great.
1,Defective and made in China,"Don't be fooled by the low price. The advertisement clearly says it works with the V3M razor. I purchased two of these thinking that even with the excessive shipping charge, it was still worth it. Neither headset works. I have the same headset that I received from Sprint and it works fine. I got one headset to work just once, but when I turned my music volume up full blast I could barely hear anything. All the other attempts resulted in nothing coming through the headset. I then plugged in the one in from Sprint, worked great. So I went to check the return policy - I should have read it thoroughly but I trusted this company. It's not worth getting an exchange or refund because you don't get reimbursed for the original shipping or the return shipping. If I wanted to exchange for a new headset, who's going to pay for shipping? What a total rip off. I should just have gone to sprint - at least I know their product really works. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,not so great,"Firstly, this was not actually a stereo headset, but actually just two mono earpieces. The earpieces were actually both for the same ear too. So, it fit comfortably in one ear and very uncomfortably in the other. Secondly, both earpieces have ripped off of the rest of the device. (I didn't think I was THAT rough on it.) Long story short, this was definitely not the item pictured, but an inferior product."
1,dont buy,"i read the reviews and still bought this item. now im warning you. DO NOT BUY. UNless you are a midget (no offense) these will not work for you. if you plan to put the phone in your pocket while you listen to music, then dont plan on using these headphones. They do work with the KRZR silver (unlocked) but it is poor sound quality. if you really want a way better product to listen to music try this New OEM Motorola Headset Adapter (Emu to 3.5mm) SYN1504. with this product you can use any set of headphones and sound quality is crystal clear. dont fall for these headphones. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, S**T!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY."
3,SOSO~,Sometimes the phone can't detect the connection of this headset. I need replug it again and again. And the quality of the sound is soso~ Other parts are fint to me.
1,Barely-ok for RAZR but NOT COMPATIBLE with KRZR K1m !!!,"The title of this item ""OEM Motorola MP3 Stereo Headset SYN1301B For RAZR V3 V3m V3i V3c V3x L2 KRZR K1m SLVR L7 L6 L2 V360 V190 V195"" is NOT accurate. I tried it with two different KRZR K1m's and this headset did not work at all with either of them. It completely incompatible with KRZR. Which sucks because that was my entire reason for the purchase.I tried it with a RAZR just to see if it worked with *anything* and it did work with the RAZR (although sound quality is not very good).BOTTOM LINE: If you need it for a KRZR K1m, DON'T get this; it is not compatible with KRZR's.If you need a hands-free set for occasional use with a RAZR, this is a cheap solution and you will get what you pay for: a s--ty headset for a cheap price. If you want better quality sound for a RAZR, get something else."
1,Unbearable head phones,I read the reviews and I was warned but didn't listen. I really can't believe that the designer of this headset ever actually tried them out. Unless you have HUGE ears this headset is useless.
3,Great for RAZR and KRAZR,"its a good pair of headphones if all you have on your phone is a usb cable port and no regular headphone port. its pretty much your only option if you want to listen to your mp3s. they sound descent but i wish i could use regular headphones. i would have to buy an extra extension in order to do that. it also sucks that you cant use them for anything else. also, dont lose them, because its not that easy to just find another pair in your house somewhere."
1,another fake item...,"I have a pair of originals that came with my phone and after making comparisons of build and sound quality (the real ones sound terrific!), these are not OEM headsets, but fakes. I'm sure the seller can't tell the difference, so that's why I'm not naming names, but I have informed Motorola of this."
1,Terrible Headset,Well to start off I only was able to use the headset once. The earpiece broke the 2nd time I tried to use it. It really wasn't worth returning for that 1+ dollars.
2,Ugh.,"Worst headset I've ever had the displeasure to wear. The cord is too short. They are an uncomfortable shape/size. The sound is faint and tinny. Even when I'm not on the train, if I turn my phone all the way up, I can just barely hear the music. I had to check the connection to see if it was only halfway plugged in or something, but it wasn't. They just suck that much. Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration. I have to shout for the person on the other end to hear me at all. Every call I've ever attempted with these I wound up giving up on them and yanking them out and just using the handset. Poor design, quality and an overall waste of money."
1,disappointed,Thought it would work for my verizon phone however after numerous emails to sf planet I learnt that these headphones do not work.
3,"Doesn't work with the Moto Q, but...","I got it to work with the Moto Q, which from some digging seemed like it might. Nope. So I gave it to someone with a RAZR. It worked fine, though they reported that people complained about not being able to hear them very well."
4,Great,Motorola Stereo headset is a great desgin headphones fit sung but not a problem and the cord does not get tangled! Also plugs in easily!
1,Absolute crap! DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!!!!!,"Is there a negative star?Much like the recent Cold Spring Harbour CD this is from a horribly bad needle drop probably taken from a cassette that's been sitting in someone's attic since the mid Carter era. There's no fidelity or redeemable audio quality at all.Not only does this disc not sound good it's not even an SACD!What you get here are recordings that have been available elsewhere with much higher quality. I don't know how this can even be a legitimate release. There's no way any owners of these recordings would approve this muddy mess of a CD. Horrible, horrible, horrible!!!!Billy, get your lawyers and yank this disc out of existence. Your fans deserve better."
1,"Correct listing, please!","I bought this CD for $6.99. I brought it home and found out why...the track listings are all wrong. Man, you really have to make an effort to screw up this badly...and make they did!Despite the ""eh' sound quality (""ah, the crackle of vinyl, preserved digitally!"") I found it fun to listen to, once I got past the hilarity of how inept a package and retread collection it is."
3,"Good for NPCs, but most players won't care","I don't know what it is with White Wolf but they seem to be having a really hard time coming up with bloodlines that players will actually want to play as. This book is filled with interesting possibilities, but they are ultimately largely used solely by the storyteller to make colorful NPCs, as the majority of players don't really see much appealing in the chapters. My favorite bloodline out of this book is the ""Players,"" where their disciplines are geared toward pretending to be something they aren't, which I find appealing from a player character standpoint. Otherwise, though, the book's use has been largely limited."
3,the vault - seems like lots of info still locked up,"Good stats, but the testimonials provide scant information. While the Vault will provide good info re: salary, billable requirements, etc., it does not really paint a picture of what its like to work at any of these places."
5,enlightnin'ment,the music of lou christie i've been listening to lou christie since iwas 10 years old.i been looking for lou christie music for long time and i have unable find him in our records store.in kingman or laughlin nv.
4,We got gypped,"This collection doesn't include my favorite Lou Christie hit, ""She Sold Me Magic"". Why? Did they think the fans wouldn't notice?"
3,Enlightnin'ment: The Best of Lou Christie...,"My favorite tune: ""Lightning Strikes."" I stumbled onto it listening to K-Earth 101 FM in Los Angeles - a great pop song. I rate the song 5 stars! Overall, I rate the disc 3 stars!"
1,Audio cassette tape instead of CD,"When I placed my order, I thought I was ordering a CD, instead a cassette tape was mailed to me."
1,product review,"Came packaged as shown... shipping costs were more than should have been on this very light weight package inside a large box.Cheaply made, felt and looked like a toy in comparison to other wind up flashlight/ cell phone chargers I had bought.Not worth the overly expensive price and shipping charges unless you want an expensive toy for your child."
