2,"Enjoyable, but not a compilation and very repetitive","Discs 1 and 2 are the same songs - except disc 1 has 2 of the newer songs and that's the only difference. Just different live performances. Disc 3 had minimal repeating of songs on the first two. So you basically get a book with lyrics and some other interesting information (book is decent) and 2 CDs. Plus, I happen to have heard enough of Mr. Lehrer's interesting songs to realize this isn't all of them. I expected to enjoy the CDs anyway, but the box set turned out to be a big let down."
1,Disappointing,"This boxed set of 3 CDs and a book is an overall disappointment. The book is great, with lots of information, and I'm glad to have it. Disk 1 is the full set of old works appearing on other single CDs. Disk 3 is mostly repititious, with an added handful of non-satirical childrens songs.Disk 2 is very poor - it consists of the same set of songs, this time as live performances, each preceeded by comments by Lehrer and followed by audience applause. The sound volume of the comments is quite low, the performances are at an appropriate sound level, and the applause sections are deafening - the result is that each of the 24 songs requires three volume adjustments. I wish I hadn't bought it - too steep a price to pay for a CD-sized book."
5,PUT IT ON AND LET IT PLAY!!!!!,"Here is one of the very reasons to buy a CD this expensive! This one is definately worth the price of admission to this banging, slamming almost heart shattering club experience. There is no reason to stop listening to these driving beats other than to catch your breath. These two DJ's really put it down with their jazzy, latin and african mixed beats. A must have for any house collection.With CD's like this, who needs to go to a club? But there are only 2 in this package"
5,Informative and Interesting.,I love this book. I wish it would have had the airlines web addresses . It should be updated every year. A must have for airline lovers.
3,SAFETY NOTE! BEWARE CHOCOLATE PLUS DOGS!,"I'm enjoying reading this book, but want to note that on p. 201 (""The Ugliness of Beauty""), the author mentions that his dog, Max, ""loved chocolate above all other foods."" For many dogs, CHOCOLATE IS TOXIC!!! DO NOT GIVE YOUR DOG CHOCOLATE!!!! If in doubt, ask your veterinarian."
3,Trouble with the accent,"The cd's ok in terms of content, but I found Dr Mac's accent to be very difficult to listen to. If you can get past a thick Scottish accent then try the cd."
1,Journey into Weight Loss,I did not care for this product - would not buy it if I had heard it first. I would like to have Amazon give their buyers a choice of hearing part of the products they sell.
5,"Folding Music Stand with Carrying Case, Black",Delivery was quick. The stand is the best portable stand I've seen. It doesn't bind or wobble. It's very practical and easy to use. Setup and takedown is a breeze. I don't see how it could be made any better. I'm glad I bought this one.
2,Not true to the descriptions,"First of all, the carry bag is not ""Zippered"" as described in the Features.The Product Details section claim that the item weight is 4 Lbs and shipping weight is 6 Lbs. However the real item weight is 2 Lbs ONLY. I contacted the seller and they replied back ""it is 4 Lbs when packed."" I was looking for a heavier and sturdier stand and the information provided misled me to choose this product over others in spite of this high shipping cost. I would not have bought it if I knew of the actual weight of the item.And they did not address my question regarding the bag at all. Very disappointed. The page needs to be updated."
4,Book,"Very cool book my daughter will love it. I can't wait till she opens it for christmas, I looked at it and I was impressed"
5,One of the best herb books!,"This is one of the best herb books I have read! I wasn't expecting much of it due to the title. But so many people raved about it being for more than just kids, so I purchased it. I am glad I did.Yes, it is written with children in mind; therefore, it is written in simple, easy to understand terms. But the book covers many herbs and their many uses. It gives simple recipies for salves, tinctures, lozenges, etc.I highly recommend this book for both children and adults. It will be especially useful for any beginning herbalist!"
5,Siltec 1000# Scale arrived quickly..Perfect Condition!,"Since my hubby cant weigh himself on an ordinary scale, this 1000 lb max Siltec Scale was perfect. It was the lowest price of any others just like it that I could find to ship to OHIO the low ship price was fantastic. Scale has enabled hubby to keep a handle on his weight, which wouldnt have been possible without it (even most of his doctors dont have a scale that can accomodate him)> I like the scale for myself also. It lines up with the professional scales at my health club and elsewhere as I am a ""normal"" weight. ..so I am assured of it's accuracy."
1,Meh...,"This scale is probably alright, but mine (ordered thru ScalesGalore via Amazon) didn't come calibrated. It was weighing 45+ lbs light (4 people got on it; it was consistently off that much for everyone)! Reading the instructions, i found out i couldn't try to calibrate it myself without voiding the warranty. So i paid to send it back and then had to pay a 20% restocking fee (that, of course, it not mentioned anywhere on Amazon when you buy it!). The scale is very heavy/sturdy, but the weight does fluctuate a lot when you're standing on it (up and down 5-10lbs). Do yourself a favor and don't order this here unless you are REALLY REALLY SURE you want it. There's no guarantee you'll get one that's set up right, and returns are a pain!"
5,GREAT!!!!,"Great scales.I am obese and am loosing weight. While I don't, nor have I ever, weigh 100Lbs, I do weigh about 500 so I needed a set of scales that could go beyong the cantemporary 250-325 of the normal bathroom scales. These are perfect for that purpose. Big Red LED readout makes it easy to read with-out having to mount the display on the wall, I just leave it at the top edge of my scales. It's well worth the $250 sticker price. They are a little larger than your typical bathroom scales, which is actually a good thing...that makes it easier to balance when standing on them."
4,Great book on self defense,"This book has excellent advice on self-defense. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more on how to protect themselves.I will take issue though with the author's stance on firearms. He makes statements that are blantly false (more people are injured with their own gun...) and others that lack foundation. He states that a firearm can only be used as a ""lethal"" choice, yet uses his own non-lethal example of ""racking"" a cartridge into his shotgun when faced with a mob of youth. The mere presence of the firearm and the sound of the shotgun being put into battery diffused the situation. Studies have shown that the mere presence of a firearm has thwarted more crime than was previously thought, see John Lott's ""More Guns, Less Crime"".Once again this one issue was not enough for me to trash the book. The basics included in this book are the best foundation for self defense I have ever seen.Rhino"
3,"Defensive Living: When Defensive Driving, Diets, and Exercise Aren't Enough to Keep You Alive and Well!",Nice book. How to act to do not became a victim. No self defence techniques ( ex. martial arts)but very appropriate advice to avoid the danger of an aggression.
2,Not really a workbook,"It has things best to try in a group than working by yourself, the tips are common things you have heard before and I wanted a book I could work in, but this book requires a separate book for your work. Good for small group of newbies."
5,"Great for all ages, Nickelodeon experts and others!","This game is really great and I highly recommend it. My 3-yr old girl and my 7-yr old boy both really enjoy it. Even though my daughter doesn't know all the characters, she can search by color and match the pictures on her bingo card to the pictures on the screen. Because it's random anyone can win which, of course, the kids love. This is also great for grandparents who know nothing about Nickelodeon characters and want a fun, low-key game to play. Spongebob does a little video tutorial in the beginning, so there are no difficult instructions to understand. That also means it takes just a couple of minutes before you're actually playing. There are little montages throughout (like 2-min. shorts) featuring various characters to keep their attention. We can and will play this again and again. They should come up with a version with magnetized chips so we can play in the car!"
5,Great value.,"I bought this as a replacement battery because it was so much cheaper than the Nikon brand. It has worked great. At least as good as the one that came with the camera, if not better."
3,Beware the warranty,"The amazon web page advertised a 3-year warranty, the item shipped has a 2-year warranty."
2,Poor sound quality,Sound quality is poor. Some songs are fair some are so distorted by pops and staticAnd that is a real shame since in this day and age it should a snap to have crystal clear recordingI know the songs are 60 years old but there are much better collections of Andrews Sisters for sale.Unless you are a huge die hard fan I would pass up on this collection
1,sub par collection,"The reviewer from Centerville, Utah sure steered me wrong about this box set. The sound is NOT excellent, in fact it's some of the worst I've ever heard, and I've heard a lot of Andrews Sisters collections. The song selection wasn't too good either. As far as the documentation goes, it's so-so at best and the photographs in the booklet were pretty badly scanned as well.Do yourself a big favor and avoid this box set.Buyer beware."
3,"A good collection of songs, but some with really bad sound quality.","I adore the Andrews Sisters.I ordered this CD set because it has titles on it that I do not have on other collections.I am glad that the songs I wanted to hear have good quality, because there are a handful of the songs that have real problems.The static that usually accompanies non-remastered recordings from this era is fine with me. I actually like that since it shows the age of the song.BUT -- some of these songs have a nasty warbled sound to them, as if they came off a bad tape recording. They should not have been included for my money.For a rough estimate, I'd say 3 songs of the first 50 have this problem. Considering the amount of music that is good quality, I don't feel like my money was wasted."
1,Wrong item Listed here.,"I ordered this case and instead got a metal rack for having lights instead . . Totally different item then I ordered,and music 123 only offered a refund,and they refused to send the correct item... What a wrong way to do business. I'm sure they knew what I ordered and what was being shipped . Such a smaller and lighter package.I wish there was a way to know before I ordered. I am so disappointed and let down ."
1,Plastic pieces wont stay together long,"I bought this case on the day I bought the iPhone hoping it would help protect it. Immediately upon placing the iPhone in the back part of the case and then putting the front cover on I realized this thing is not going to stay snapped in place long. I was right. I did simple things like placing it in my pocket, taking it out, placing on desk etc. The plastic pieces unsnap readily, so you will find that you will spend time snapping it back together. It comes with a belt clip...NO WAY would I trust this thing to stay together while walking. The chances are too great that my $600 phone would pop out. CONCLUSION: Buy a better/other case if you intend on clipping it on a belt. The only thing I can see this case is good for is propping it up on your desk like a photo album. For $25, its not worth it. I took mine back."
1,iPhone 3Gs doesn't fit in this case,"The iPhone 3Gs (and probably the 3G) doesn't fit in this case. From the date of the reviews, it was probably made for the original iPhone (2G)."
1,Case damaged iphone,"This is the worst product I can imagine, the case is cheap plastic that has not held up well. I noticed damage to my iphone and upon closer examination I determined that the cheap plastic case was scratching my iphone. If you want to buy a case that will damage your iphone, this is the product. If you want to buy a case that will preserve your iphone, dont buy this, IT WILL DAMAGE YOUR IPHONE, GUARANTEED!"
1,Miserable garbage - Ruins iPhone!,"I bought this case from my local AT&T; store on the day the iPhone came out. My phone's finish has been destroyed by this miserable case despite never having been dropped or mistreated. I've only carried it in a pocket with no other foreign objects.The back, sides, and bezel are all scratched horribly and dotted with deep pockmarks. Avoid this case like the plague. This is the first 1 star review I have ever given.[Update, Feb 2008]: Belkin never sent the warranty claim form they promised to send me after I complained numerous times. The case totally destroyed the finish on the back of my iPhone. I've since purchased an Agent18 case which I wholeheartedly recommend. This Belkin product should never have been released, and quite frankly, Amazon is doing its customers a disservice by continuing to carry it."
1,Nice Looking .... Poor Design,"Got mine from AT&T and returning it. The case makes your iPhone dock useless. The plastic seems brittle and it has undid itself a couple of times. Luckily, my iPhone did not fall off. The clip is only for belts and will not clip onto gartered clothing very well since it is not spring loaded. Since the clip also serves as a stand, your belt will go behind the clip until you get used to it. Definitely a recipe for disaster."
2,"Decent prep-test guide, but won't pass the particular test alone","I just finished my Environment and Humanity Dantes test (5/28/09) and I scored a 52. Passing score is 46. I barely got by. This book hints at some important topics in the test, but misses a lot of questions. I used the book in conjunction with Wikipedia and other online sources. The book gave me a good guideline for researching topics online. I could recommend doing this, but I didn't use a text book and I barely passed. If you want to exceed at this test, buy a text book. If you want to get by, use this book with online resources."
4,Of course it's good.,"It's the Oblivians. There's almost no way it's gonna be bad. Probably not the best starting point for the band, and the sound is even more lo-fi than usual, but so what? It rocks. 18 songs and not a bad one amongst them- ""Feel Real Good,"" ""Five Hour Man,"" and ""Can't Afford You"" are real standouts, though."
1,The bitterest of realities...,"""April Raintree"" is a depressing story which attempts to be uplifting and fails. It is the story of a native girl who attempts to find her identity amidst racism and stereotypes. On one fateful day, her innocence is lost and she must learn to accept who she is and to trust others. Her misery knows no bounds and the reader is left unsatisfied, as April's redemption is not completely won. How could Culleton subject the protaganist to so much pain and angst? It leaves the reader feeling emotionally drained and thoroughly disgusted"
5,As fun a read as I have had in a long time,"Rarely do I enjoy a book as much as I have enjoyed this one. Witty and well written and just fun. But strictly for adults.I have no idea why there are so few reviews here. Since it was published in the late 80's, I am guessing the reading public has missed this treasure. But it deserves to be rediscovered.It does give some insight into the world of business and relationships and a lot of other things as well, as any good novel should.A politically incorrect type will probably enjoy it best."
4,Slow delivery,Took a little longer than expected to receive my book. It was as described when I received it.
5,Eli Sands and his friends are trapped in 19th century America after an accident with their time-travel vessel,"Eli Sands and his friends are trapped in 19th century America after an accident with their time-travel vessel, stranded in different times. Separated, the group must not only make contact with each other again; they must assure their accident doesn't change history itself."
2,Doubt its 100% Copper,I seriously doubt its 100% copper. The cross section of the wires are bright like tin. Where as monster cable is same color as outer wiring.
3,Meh...it is ok,"Fit my purpose to power a 90 watt x2 amp...quality is average, flexibility of the wire is good. Price is what sets this item apart. If you are looking for long runs with high power consumption, my suggestion would be to look for better wire."
2,"NOT OFC, ALUMINUM TINNED!","The only thing good about it was the price. Seeing as it is still false advertisement, I gave it a 2 star."
3,Great for Boys,"Both my sons, ages 4 and 20 months, are addicted to anything Thomas, so they love this DVD. It's not bad, sort of educational since it tries to teach morals. I, myself, don't care for Thomas much, but it keeps my boys happy. One of the better DVDs though, is Songs from the Station, which I highly recommend for any Thomas fans, and it's the least annoying."
1,Horrible Thomas DVD,All Togther- the Whole DVD is Bad but here are a few things that are the worst!1. They Changed the Theme music to a stupid wired rytham that we all hate! Waht happend to the good music we all love?2. Those stupd activtes insted of the intermsiions bewtween stories. What? Even for kids they are dome and piontless and way too easy!3. Have really noticed how the engines look and move> -Yeah! that what I'm Taking about!Hit is absoultoly runing Thomas! I HOPE THOMAS AND THE JET ENGINE WILL BE BETTER!
1,I'm Pretty Sure Hit is Trying To Hide This Turkey,Whoa man this thing was awful. All of the numerous Thomas tapes and dvds there have been I don't think i've ever watched one this bad. A horrible attempt to live on without Alec Baldwin but they got him back in the next one. The intermissions are painfully boring and to top that the theme song is gone. Some people who haven't been watching Thomas since the beginning don't mind that it's gone as much as I do but i've heard and love dthat song so many times. I was so upset to hear that awful tune instead of the beloved song I am used to hearing. They also decided to only put 4 stories in. That right there makes it not worth the money. This movie will make you cry so do not buy this. To top of that Hit Entertainment is trying to take this off the movie lineup. Don't buy it is not worth the money.
2,Boy this video is dumb!,I thought New Friends for Thomas was bad. But in this video the stories don't even make sense! A whole episode about Henry wishing to pull a passenger train. It seemed to me that Henry takes turns with Gordon pulling the express all the time! The stories in general are just inconsistent with the previous stories - maybe they should have watched the previous videos before writing these stupid stories?I didn't like the new computer animation but that wasn't so bad. I gave it two stars because some of the songs between stories were pretty cute. But I hated the educational segments.What a waste of money! Why can't they just stick with what was so successful for so many years?
1,Terrible- Not like the other ones!!,"Please this DVD is very, very bad! When I saw the cover I thought is was going to be good. But when My child saw ths he Fell asleep!! The Engines do not look roght and they move very differently! Also the the opening where it says Thomas & Freinds-What??? That's not the song! Please I really am telling you DO NOT BUY THIS ONE! IT IS HORRIBLE:(!!"
5,Black Coffee,The whole cd just makes you feel good! Pippi is an excellent interpreter of songs and Black Coffee is the a great stepping song. I Love it!If you're blue don't put it on because you won't be blue for long.
2,"""defense against the father""","Those were the words Freud wrote in Jung's first theoretical break with him; and although SYMBOLS OF TRANSFORMATION (as it was later called) couldn't be reduced to a complex, Jung amply displayed his father issues through repeated and even abusive attacks on Freud's work. Jung's thinking here does him little credit; mixed in with some important critiques of Freudian reductionism are countless comments motivated more by emotionality than a desire to build bridges."
4,notes from a beginning facetor,"Of many books designed to get you started ,this was the most carefully written and helpful one that I found. Except that the angles for the Trilliant cut on page 220 simply do not work. Iwould like to know what the correct angles were to be."
5,Berkshire Hosiery,"Great product. Comfortable, good-looking. Price a bit high but that's okay. Color is true."
5,Una gran obra,Mi esposa m había hablado sobre este libro y nunca le dijo la importancia para leerlo pensaba erróneamente que lo sabía todo....cuan equivocado estaba y gracias a ella me dice a la tarea d buscarlo en amazon y leerlo y aprende mucho de él. Una gran experiencia que ahora recomiendo mis amigos.
2,bueno,El tema es bueno pero me aburrio al final ....siento qe todo el libro habla de lo mismo y si mayor interes..
1,"Poor QC, bad welds","This accumulator arrived on time and was well packed. There are dust caps on all of the fittings, including the large ports. In addition, replacement o-rings are included.The accumulator fit my 1988 Pontiac Fiero ok. There was one problem with fitment; the outlet hole is slightly too small, so it was very hard to fit my outlet tube in so I could tighten the fitting. It created some metal burrs when I tried to install it the first time, so I had to carefully remove them before reassembly. The hole should be larger so there is a clearance fit.A pressure test revealed that the welds for the fittings were full of leaky pinholes. This unit will not hold any pressure. I'm not sure why I trusted the welds to begin with -- they are laid on like worms and did not penetrate and fuse the fittings to the body. If you decide to order one of these, carefully inspect the welds. If they are at all questionable, return the unit and consider buying another brand as I did."
4,"Great idea, abysmal quality","Until I bought this mouse I had terrible pain in my fingers from clicking a mouse all day and was developing wrist pain, too. It completely solved my problems because it requires no movement of your fingers (well, besides your thumb) or wrist, however, this mouse is still a P.O.S. After a few months of use, mine developed the infamous ""double click"" problem so often mentioned here. Another person in our office experienced the same. So what are we supposed to do? There is no other mouse design like this, so it seems that 3m is under no pressure to improve quality and a great idea is thus being held captive in this chintzy plastic tribute to cheapness! Sad."
3,Pretty good,"I've had this mouse for over a year now. When I first started using it, it DID help me release tension and stress on my wrist since I have carpal tunnel, but now, my wrist started hurting again and the tension goes throughout my whole right arm."
2,Evoluent Vertical mouse is better,"I tried this mouse about a decade ago. Worked ok for awhile, but then got in the bad habit of using my fore finger on the top of the mouse for hitting the mouse button! Obviously not how you're supposed to use it. But I ended up ditching it and going back to a regular mouse. Fast forward 5 years and I tried the Evoluent Vertical mouse. MUCH better and sturdier, and more comfortable and less ""weird"". Evoluent solved my wrist/hand pain. Never going back."
1,Waste of money,"Very uncomfortable, Waste of money. I do computer production work and thought it would keep my wrist from dragging on the mouse pad. It is not useful at all for high speed mousing."
5,Great change for me to the new 3M mouse,"This product is surprisingly not known very much. I just saw a couple people using it and ask them. They all said you have to get it if you do a considerable amount of work on a PC. I would think it would help anyone with hand, wrist, arm or even shoulder issues. My arm would just get fatigued quicker than I thought it should. I wanted to try something new and it has worked out great. I think I've had it for 2-3 months now and its just great. Takes some getting used to but after you get through that, you're on your way to relaxation. I've seen some reviews and they said it didn't scroll. It does. The fingertips have one button and that is a scroll."
5,Great relief!,"This mouse is great. Better than the EvoulantEvoluent Right-Handed VerticalMouse 3 - Mouse - optical - 5 button(s) - wired - USB - black, silverwhich doesn't support your hand, you have to squeeze it constantly. Also cheaper (especially on Amazon) than Evoulant, QuillErgonomic Quill Mouse Pc and Mac Left Hand Whiteor Zero Tension Mouse. My wife has one at work and I have them on both home computers. They prevented emerging problems for her and allowed me to work on the computer with my dominant hand before, during and after treatment (O.T.) for hand, wrist, arm, elbow problems. If you don't get an ergonomic mouse that supports your hand, you may be solving only part of your problem. I would recommend it even for people who are not having problems - mousing is so much more comfortable and natural (after the learning curve).Only negative is not wireless."
1,Fragile and painful on mac,"My desk is 2.6 feet from the floor. This fell off one time and the top began swiveling. It feel off a second time and the top broke off. It is held on by two tiny tabs.Also, though it helped my carpal tunnel, on the mac there is no easy way to redefine the north south access to something different which led to my shoulder getting out of positon and 4 weeks of chiropractic visits to correct the pain. Thanks, but not thanks. Perhaps the PC software lets you address this, but for me it is a nonstarter"
2,Produced shoulder strain,"I had hoped to use this mouse for times when I have several days of click-drag-release activities. Because your grip is a couple of inches higher than on other mouses, I experienced much shoulder tension. (I saw this problem mentioned in another review also.) Perhaps with the right desk setup you can compensate.Also, I find a stationary mouse such as the thumbball or the Logitech Marble Mouse provides more exact mousing for me."
4,"On my 3rd one, but still happy","It's true, if you use this mouse for many hours a day then they have about 3 or 4 months of life - they start to double click like crazy, so you have to throw it out. I'm on my 3rd one, but it has allowed me to get my work done without pain. This seems like a small price to pay to reduce pain and allow me to keep working. I just purchased 3 of them so that I have about a 1 year supply. Maybe 3M will read these reviews and actually make a durable product, but why would they want to sell fewer mice?"
1,Beware of worsening problems,"I run the IT department in a small office (around 30 users). Four of the users who had turned to this mouse to deal with carpal tunnel issues initially found it quite comfortable. However, that changed over time with each one complaining of pain from the thumb to the wrist.The problem, as far as I can tell, is that this mouse requires too much extension of the thumb -- far more than one would expect in a normal mouse. I'd suggest staying clear of it and replacing any that you may have purchased with an alternative that does not require as much thumb movement."
1,"Screws up your Thumb - get the ""Ergonomic Quill Mouse"" instead!","I developed tendinitis on my right wrist due to computer mouse problems, and decided to buy this product.This mouse helped a bit with my wrist tendinitis, but GAVE ME PROBLEMS WITH MY THUMB!! That part of my right hand where the thumb meets the wrist ached so much that I had to quit using this mouse. The pain disappeared soon thereafter.I now use the ""Ergonomic Quill Mouse"", and it works like magic! Although a bit more expensive than this one, it is well worth the money."
4,Size is important -- Righties only,"Size is important, so why doesn't Amazon provide a sizing guide... Note that large fits better if your hand is 3.5 inches across the knuckles. Otherwise get the small-medium. Also note that this item is only for right hand mousing. But it does feel good. Almost immediately. No drivers enclosed, but it is plug and play. They say that specific drivers are downloadable."
2,Left click button sticks,"I loved the feel of this mouse and it definitely helped my carpal tunnel; however, the left click button started sticking after only a few weeks of use. I ordered a replacement and experienced the same problem. I would have given this mouse 5 stars for the feel, but the sticking button made it just too annoying to use."
5,3M Ergonomic Mouse,This mouse is easy to use and quite wonderful. You can adapt to it in a couple of days. It has eliminated the tired sensation I had been feeling in the middle part of my right hand at the end of the day. I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a computer for any length of time. It is definitely worth the investment.
2,Didn't help me,"I use the mouse alot, and have been having increasing pain in my right hand, so I purchased this mouse hoping it would ease all the pain. I used this about 30 minutes, and it hasn't helped the pain at all, in fact, my hand usually doesn't get this fatigued until 3-4 hours, but with this one, just using it 30 minutes has put me in great pain and hand fatigue. The issue is in the grip I believe. Also, you have to move your whole hand, not your wrist, which means that even if your hand didn't hurt, your shoulder and upper arm will get sore from using it alot. One good thing though is that you will probably build muscles and you will burn more calories just sitting at your desk. :-)"
5,Awesome mouse,"I have used this same mouse at two different companies I have worked for over the last three years. It took a little getting used to the first week, but after than I can use it like a charm. I no longer have any kind of wrist, elbow or hand pain. I highly recommend. Be aware that they come in different sizes. I also suggest using an ergonomic keyboard."
2,Better than Conventional Mouse?,"Before using this mouse, I had a lot of pain in my wrist and fingers from heavy computer usage in the office (9 hours a day, 5 days a week). Initially, this mouse virtually eliminated the pain that I had in my wrist and index finger. But after a month or two of use, I developed new pain in different parts of my hand. So I switched back to a conventional mouse. I switched back and forth with this mouse and a conventional mouse every couple of weeks for a few months, but stopped switching when this mouse suddenly stopped working. Now, I use a conventional mouse and do hand and wrist exercises (I found a great video online but can't remember where I found it)daily. The exercises have helped more than anything else. In my opinion, save your money and don't buy this."
4,Great mouse alternative,This product has cut down on my finger/thumb and wrist pain. I would recommend this to anyone with arthritis or similar problems with their hands/wrists.
4,Great for lots of scrolling,"Great mouse for specific applications. I use it primarily on a PACS workstation to scroll through CTs and MRIs. Keeps you index finger from bulking up from scrolling back and forth so much. No pressure on the base of your palm from resting your wrist on the desk like when holding a regular mouse.All the motion is in your shoulder, not your wrist which takes a little bit of getting used to, especially subtle movements, but for 8+ hours of use, its great."
4,Missing scroll wheel function,"I don't have any wrist injury but having used the mouse too often lately, decided to try this product and give my index finger a rest. In most cases, it is easy to adapt to the new posture, which is quite comfortable.The big drawback is this mouse does not have a scroll wheel. It becomes a major problem when some applications use the scroll wheel for zoom functions. Having just a third button doesn't make up for it. I end up having a regular mouse handy for applications in which I need the scroll wheel."
3,Created new problems,"Although I thought that this mouse was helping my RSI issues (shoulder pain and elbow pain), after a week of using it, it was creating severe wrist and thumb joint pain. Maybe it is just me, but I returned it and am going to try the vertical mouse."
3,Good shape bad firmware.,I used to own the older version of this mouse. it was perfect. It worked like a charm.The new ones with the new firmware are real bad. They go to sleeping mode every 5-10 minutes. It takes around 30seconds to 1minute of hussle to get them out of the sleeping mode. So I have to stop using it for a minute every 5-10 minutes.
1,No scroll wheel,"No scroll wheel, not really ease the hand pain. not comfortable. Return it right away."
4,3M Ergonomic Mouse,The 3M Ergonomic Mouse has reduced reduce hand and wrist problems. It works well in most software I have used it with. A scroll wheel would make it easer to use in SoldWorks.
1,Beware of thumb problems! Get Evoluent Vertical Mouse instead.,"I got this mouse in 2006 to help with wrist pain. My wrist pain went away for a few months and then came back, accompanied by pain in my thumb. I solved my wrist pain by improving my posture and reducing my time at the computer. I stopped using this mouse after about 6 months, but even after six years the discomfort still occasionally comes back. Now I exclusively use anEvoluent Vertical Mouse 3.TLDR: Don't buy this 3M mouse because you'll mess up your thumb. Instead get theEvoluent VM4 Vertical Mouse."
4,NICE ITEM,I GOT THIS ITEM VERY FAST.THIS IS A NICE ITEM THAT WORK ON OTHER PART OF THE HAND.HELP TO RELIEF THE PAIN OF KARPEL TUNNEL SYNDROMTHE DISADVANTAGE THAT I THINK IS THE BUTTONS THEY NOT LOOK LIKE ISA DURABLE FOR A LONG TIME.(NOT SAW COMFORT)BOTTOM LINE-IT WORTH IT.
5,3M Ergonomic Mouse,"Joystick model mouse was recommended by a hand therapist who was treating me for carpal tunnel syndrome. It was easy to get used to, and helped alleviate my symptoms."
5,3M Ergonomic Mouse EM500,"3M Ergonomic Mouse SMALL/MEDIUMAwesome mouse! For someone with initial stages of CTS wrist/palm pain, this is a lifesaver.. very very effective design."
4,nicely designed mouse,"This is really a great ergonomic mouse. I use mine frequently and I'm very happy with it. There are some downsides, though. 1) There's no software to improve the precision of the mouse. Since you're using larger muscles to move the cursor around the screen, it is hard to aim precisely. I would have liked some software to move the cursor more slowly when the arm is moving more slowly -- the built-in Windows options for this sort of thing do not work well. 2) The mouse is optical, rather than mechanical, and so there is a lot of uncomfortable friction moving it around on the desktop, especially with the weight of the arm pressing down on it. I would have preferred an old-school style rolling-ball version. 3) The mouse buttons (click click click) feel uncharacteristically cheap and flimsy."
2,no wheel!,"This mouse probably works fine if you aren't using a drafting software, but if you are an architect, designer, etc, I would not recommend. There is no wheel, which means you can not use the ""dynamic pan & zoom"" commands in programs like AutoCAD and Revit. I feel this is a major shortcoming."
3,"Okay for short term relief, not for long term use","The 3M Ergonomic mouse was a relief, at first, to my painful mouse wrist and mouse-wheel finger. But after a few months of use the thumb rocker caused severe thumb pain. For the past several months, I have been using the mouse only seldom, until last weekend, when I spent a full day on the computer. Over the last five days, I've used it a few more times, but the pain has returned full strength.If you buy this mouse, use it until your pain from using other devices subsides. Then try switching between this device and other devices on a regular basis to avoid developing chronic pain. Once the pain appears and becomes severe, this mouse will be of little use in the future."
3,"different for different's sake is not better, it's just dumb","one finger digit is no better at doing the click than another. In fact, the thumb is the worst digit for getting muscle problems. That's why most joysticks went from top button(as in ATARI) to a trigger(in the stick). Why do you think Air Force Pilots have such great skill? A trigger not a top button. Why in hell does some ""Genious"" do that with the mouse. Because convention is too obtuse that's why. My mother has it because of her hand but a wrist brace works just fine."
1,My Hand is Tingling With Pain,My wrist still hurts I am getting a numb/needles and pins feeling in my hand from this device. It is worse than a regular mouse. I can't believe these reviews are for real.
1,Not ergonomic for me,"I purchased this mouse on the recommendation of a corporate ergonomics expert, in an attempt to reduce wrist pain. I'm sure that it works for some people, perhaps even many, but it did not help me at all. It's sitting unused next to my ordinary-type mouse."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this mouse on the advice of others with work related RSI, and while ergonomically an improvement, I no longer have any access to scrolling. While the blurbs all claimed mac and linux compatible - what they really meant was some function in mac and linux as scrolling appears not to function. A huge disappointment for such a costly mouse."
2,Handle Broke off of 2 Mice with Normal Use,"Ergonomically, this mouse functions fine, but on the 2 that I've owned, both handles broke off within 5 months of normal use. What a hassle."
2,Close but no cigar,"This product is a two-button mouse. It is ergonomic (i.e., it doesn't cause as much stress on the hand as a regular mouse). The big drawback is that I can't scroll with it. Apparently the scroll feature only works for Microsoft products such as Internet Explorer and Outlook Express. I don't use either of these. If they'd write some more software, It might be a better product.I'm now using the Logitech Marble Mouse. It has some drawbacks too, but it has more functions than the 3M Ergonomic MOuse."
4,for my kids,"I bought this for my kids, 5 and 3. This is a lot easier for them to use than a standard mouse or the track pad. I was expecting and wanting more of a joy stick but this works. It was nice that I could just plug it in and have the kids use it with ease."
4,3M Ergonomic Mouse,"This item was recommended by a business associate of mine after seeing me wear a splint or wrist support designed to reduce carpal tunnel syndrome. I typically work about half my time installing computer & surveillance systems but the discomfort was definitely coming from daily mouse maintenance. Upon grabbing one of these devices you immediately feel the elimination of stress in the area where might have had carpal tunnel. I recommend using the 3M mouse at elbow height, forearm in near horizontal position. If you have discomfort in the wrist because of typical mouse design, this device is very strongly recommended. Last note. If the damn number pad wasn't on the right side of the keyboard competing for mouse position, it would be perfect. Now I'm getting more problems typing on the keyboard moved somewhat to my left side. I'm getting out my saber saw!"
4,Ergonomic Mouse,This product definitely made a difference for me. The ache that I was experiencing in my wrist soon disappeared after a few days of using this product.
4,Great mouse - but only lasted 2 years,"I would highly recommend this mouse for anyone looking at an ergonomic alternative. Plug it in and works right away. Only downside is that after 2 years it started reading single clicks like double clicks. So I had to buy another one. So it may not last as long as a traditional mouse.Bottom line, this mouse is way easier on the hands. I experienced significantly less pain and would highly recommend it to anyone with hand pain."
2,Annoying in many ways,"First, this mouse has two sizes. I am 5'8, male, and have average sized hands. The small/medium sized mouse was too small for my comfort. Second, I do not like having the main buttons on the top. Those who suffer from some type of RSI are generally susceptible to other types. Using my thumb so much gave me trigger finger. I stopped using the mouse and went back to my old mouse."
3,From One Pain to Another,"I have very mixed feelings about this mouse. I ordered it based on other recommendations to cure the pain in my wrist I was encountering from too many hours using a regular and marble mouse. I have to admit that to this end, this mouse has worked well for addressing the pain issue. But the new pain I now have is the way this mouse tracks. It is incredibly frustrating how poorly it tracks, and how it tends to jump around the screen for no apparent reason. Even loading the mouse's software tools (not a driver) doesn't give you any way to address this issue. But all-in-all, I guess it's better to be frustrated than in real physical pain.--Update--The tracking issues has been lessened by changing the mouse pad, but unfortunately the pain in my wrist is reappearing."
2,Love it but it broke in a few days,It is difficult to use this mouse with precision but it is much more comfortable than a regular mouse. My sore wrist did not hurt anymore using this mouse. The only problem is it broke in a few days. I sent it back and have been unable to get a new one.
2,Another disappointment from 3M,"This is the 3rd 3M product I have purchased that has been a serious disappointment in quality. The large sized mouse is actually pretty small. I knew that going into it based on previous reviews. Everything said previously is correct about the size.Also, the button some the thumb button has begun to stick. I have only been using it for a few hours and it is already beginning to not function well.I hope that 3M actually reviews what people say about their products. I am not sure I would ever want to buy anything from 3M again. Quality is no longer their forte."
4,Good for wrist problems,"This is a copy of the Anir mouse from Norway, also called a Renaissance mouse. The mouse eliminates wrist movement. I have wrist tendinitis, and this helps tremendously. The mouse is moved more by shoulder movement. If you have shoulder problems, then this is not good."
5,Works well!,This device does exactly what I expected and what was described. I am tatally satisfied with this substitute for a plain mouse!
5,"Best for those with wrist/finger problems, but....","I have major arthritus in my wrists and fingers. This mouse is the answer and cure for the pain caused by regular mouses. But I initially found the little pads on the bottom of the mouse would hang up on my mouse pad. I solved that problem by shaving off the pads so the bottom was smooth. Lately, I have to reboot to reactivate the mouse. For some reason the light on the bottom goes out and the mouse dies. Rebooting solves the problem. I just removed the base to see if I could figure out the problem and removed the front weight (cuz I couldn't get it back in). So far so good. Even if that doesn't solve the problem, I will buy another as I can use this mouse all day long with complete comfort."
5,Great for computer professionals with wrist pain,"I make a living on my computer, spending 12-16 hours a day in front of it. Not long ago it looked as if I'd have to give up my computer use due to severe wrist pain. Some days I couldn't use my right hand at all, and on ""good days"" things weren't much better. Doc told me I was looking at carpal tunnel surgery. Well, that was his opinion. But I wasn't about to go under the knife after seeing the dismal results several colleagues have gotten after carpal tunnel surgery. I kept looking for a product that would solve the problem naturally, and I spent a lot of money on ergonomic equipment which didn't alleviate the problem. I finally came across the 3M Ergo Mouse, and it solved the problem."
3,Comfortable but poor durability,"I like the comfort of this mouse, but I have had the left mouse button stop working on two of them. The first one lasted a year. The second one only lasted a few months."
2,"Good for ergonomics, but limited in performance","I was developing wrist/thumb pain, so I thought it was time to go with an ergonomic mouse. At first, I liked this mouse. My thumb got tired, but the wrist pain went away. However, the performance of this mouse is frustrating. You click on an icon, and nothing happens. So you have to reposition the pointer until you finally hit it. So you waste 10 seconds. But think about how many times you click on something while you are working - those seconds add up in a hurry. Due to the poor response, I've given up. Good thing Amazon had a good price on it or it would have been more dollars down the drain."
4,good for carpal tunnel,"I got this mouse since regular mice gave me carpal tunnel. It took a about a week to get used to, and is pretty comfortable, but if your hand is 3.5"" wide or less, get the small version of this mouse! I thought, the larger version would be better for me since I have relatively large hands, but at just over 3.5"" wide, I think the smaller version might have been a better fit for me."
2,"Awkward, only in a different way","I found the position they thought was neutral for the hand to be quite awkward. A stick that just stands straight up in the air would have been more comfortable, but this stands forward and to the left. Also it's very difficult to use the mouse without hitting the finger button, which on a Mac does something totally random. That button should be much smaller so you don't accidentally hit it every time you grab hold of the mouse. Furthermore, since you rest the weight of your hand and arm on it, it would have been better if the bottom platform were padded like a mousepad."
4,The only Mouse for me,I purchased one for work and after a year or so I had to have one for home. I knit all the time and want to take care of my hands. Make sure you get the right size. I had the large one for a short time and the reach for the thumb was not natural. Otherwise once you get used to clicking the correct side of the button it is smooth and I have very little hand fatigue.
5,The 3M ergo mouse rules!,"I have used these 3M mouse for about 4 years. They are not as durable as other mice, but they quickly relieve carpal tunnel symptoms."
5,Little funky.. would buy again,"I have very small hands so I purchased the small/medium size. It isn't small enough, I can't use my my middle finger to click on the scroll button. I found with practice I was using my thumb instead. At first it hurt my hands in a new spot.. but still hurt. I found that by placing my hand in a little bit different way, I was able to use my thumb and have really gotten to love it. It is different and at first I couldn't do some things and was jumping back and forth with the regular mouse. Now it throws me to use the standard mouse. I'm packing my mine back and forth to work, waiting for my work ones to come in. Don't give up quickly like I almost did... keep trying and one day it will just hit you that... wow.. just have to have my joy stick mouse...."
2,Bought 2. Same problem both times,"This is a nice mouse for a couple weeks, but like another posting I read, I had the same problem- it treats single clicks as double clicks. This can be a pain, as I've accidentally closed windows, and opened things I didn't intend to. I replaced my first one because I liked the mouse, and thought it was just an isolated case and that the one I'd replace would be different. But now my second one is doing the same thing!"
4,Helped my Hand Pain,"Before purchasing this mouse I would get pain on the top of my hand after only 5 minutes of using a regular mouse. This 3M mouse took a bit of time to get used to, but it totally stopped my pain. While it isn't as nimble or precise as a regular mouse, it works just fine and allows me to do all of my tasks pain free."
4,even more relief than other ergo mouses,"I have a evoluent vertical mouse which I love because it gave me immediate relief from RSI symptoms. But I thought i'd give this a try after finding the scroll wheel causes me discomfort. This shape is weird and the scroll takes some getting used to but totally worth the trouble. Love that its so lightweight but it doesn't travel well. Broke mine before the first month was up by taking it on a trip to NYC. Its still working and with a little super glue its ""good as new"", but thats a warning to travelers out there. Can't just toss this in the bag.Otherwise it'd get 5 stars. Just bought 2 more so I can have them on all my computers. Wish there were more places to buy them! I still use my evoluent one too, depends on the tasks you need to do which mouse is 'better'."
5,Lifesaver,"I am suffering from tennis elbow and golfer's elbow, not from the sports, but from working at my desk. I checked out every type of mouse but they all had to have my hand flat. I was in too much pain. Then I saw this vertical mouse. My pain was significantly less in a vertical position. So I tried this mouse. I am so much more comfortable and am adapting easily to this mouse. I highly recommend it to anyone with pain from using traditional mice or suffering from tennis elbow."
2,Uncomfortable,I bought this mouse since I started getting some pain in my write from extended mouse use. I wanted to buy something ergonomic. This mouse itself is ergonomic. The palm and wrist positioning is good. However the bad part was having to move the mouse just like a regular one. It is uncomfortable and clumsy. I found positioning the cursor accurately quite difficult. The mouse would also fall off often from my tilted tray.I returned this and bought a Logitech Trackman. I find the trackman much easier and comfortable.
4,Helps relax my wrist,"Definitely happy I bought this product. Keeps my wrist relaxed and in a neutral position.The craftsmanship seems OK at best. When I first plugged in the mouse, I noticed I could not right-click. The problem ended up being the side button. It was pressed in and seemed to have been stuck. I ended up having to pry that button loose with a knife. Anytime I click that side button it will get stuck. I'm not even sure what the button's purpose is in Windows 7, so I tend to avoid it.The mouse works perfectly fine in Linux. I use Linux Mint 11 and it was simply plug and play."
4,Ergonomic Optical Mouse,This product gives me a different angle for my hand when mousing. Unfotunately my hand is right at the breaking point between the small and large models. I chose the small and probably should have gone with the large. I takes time to get used to but does help with hand fatigue and pain.
4,Makes mousing less painful,"I really like the 3m mouse. I've been using them since before 3m bought the line fromthe previous manufacturer, maybe 10 years. They're not for people who need a scrollwheel,but they're great for everyone else who needs to use large muscles rather than smallones for mousing. Takes a day to get used to. If I try using a regular mouse, my handgets sore after a few days, and I have to switch back to the 3m mouse. I find them rathermore comfortable than any other 'vertical' mice I've tried.The joint between the vertical part and the flat part is a bit fragile.In the decade or so I've been using these, I've managed to break that joint on two mice by dropping them.This time I was able to repair it with epoxy glue; I had to set it so one side was sitting on a book tokeep the vertical part really vertical so the glue would set without the vertical part falling overwhile the glue cured overnight.(Not surprisingly, these mice work fine with Linux, Ubuntu or otherwise.)"
1,3M has ZERO support for this product,"This is insane. I bought the wired 3M ergo mouse. After an exhaustive series of trial and error it does not seem to work on any mac with an Intel Core Duo processor.I just called 3M phone support and all he could tell me is, ""I know it's crazy, but we have no support for this product beyond physical defects."""
3,Some features don't work for Mac.,"I really like the way the 3M ergonomic mouse works as far as ergonomics go. It keeps my wrist in a very good position. Using the thumb to click the mouse left and right buttons would take some getting used to, but it is totally workable, with one exception. I received my first mouse and the scroll button never mechanically functioned correctly. I couldn't actually depress the button without awkwardly and un-ergonomically twisting my wrist. I returned it and got another one. The button mechanically works just fine, but it is not functional as a scroll button on the Mac! This is not something that was noted on the product listing, or even on the physical box of the product! After I had trouble with the first mouse, I e-mailed my question to 3M. They never responded, not even to simply say that what I wanted to do was not possible. I'm going to return it as soon as I can, and I'm pretty unhappy with my experience."
4,"3M Ergonomic Mouse works well, but breaks easily if dropped","This mouse lets me work with out aggravating my carpel tunnel problems. But I dropped it only once on carpet, and it broke! The plastic arm is a lever with very fragile plastic tabs that connect the arm to the base. One of these plastic tabs broke and is rattling around inside the base. The arm is now loose. I will try to glue it. This is a major weakness in this product!"
4,Ergonomic Mouse,"This was a great purchase. I was suffering from a lot of pain in my wrist and this has helped me a lot. I have had this mouse only for a little over 1 month...therefore, take my review with a grain of salt.But this is definitely better than the regular mice."
2,Not helping my over-use issues,"I'm on the computer 10-12 hours a day. I was hopeful that this device would help with my over-use issues in my right-hand. While I did experience some relief initially, almost a month later and I was back to square one, and the over-use issues had moved from my wrist to my upper hand.Might be helpful for temporary relief, but it is not a cure for tendinitis and over-use."
2,Good but not durable,This mouse worked well for me relieving pain in my arm and elbow. However the device did not last 3 months with light use.
5,a great prop!,"This book, though the lines are somewhat dated and absurd, makes a great prop and ice-breaker out and about in the community. Just pretend you're reading it on the bus so the title is visible, then smile slyly at the babe who's checking out the title from the opposite seat. If she smiles, it's up to you."
4,4 STARS FOR BEING SO DARN FUNNY!,"I came across this book recently at a thrift store and I had to purchase it just because it looked really cheesy! I figured for 25 cents it was worth it just to see what it was all about. The copy I have is the original one from the 1970's. Being a woman born in that decade it was really humurous to see what women and men thought about ""picking up chicks"". The book is way outdated but is worth the buy if for nothing else than a good laugh and a coffee table conversation piece."
2,Grossly Outdated,"This book is very much out of date. Most of the recommendations Weber makes would land you in court on sexual harassment charges. However, it would be a good reference for historical research since it was originally published in 1970!"
1,Shameful,Shamefully takes advantage of shy lonely men. Everything in this book is obvious--and if you could do what he suggests you wouldn't need the book in the first place.
5,"A haunting, sideways look at the world the reveals the truth","Leaving me in silence, it froze the marrow of my bones--the words softly painting a crystal picture of horror and truth...and beauty and valor. Holding me in its grasp, not letting go until the last words were spoken, and then asking me to read it again, the character's voices calling in my head like ghosts from a grave--a grave Capote himself dug"
3,Obvious work of a first time author,"Sometimes I think books that are considered ""classics"" are given good reviews because people, who are told the book is a good read, start to believe it actually is. I thought the book was decent but definitively not worth all the praise it gets. I found the writing choppy and unclear is several places. This was most apparent towards the end when Joel became ill. Maybe I fell asleep but I didn't see any clear indication on what his illness was. This lack of explanation made the story a very tedious read. I'm currently reading a later work by Truman Capote and his writing had vastly improved with age."
3,Bogged down,"I found Other Voices, Other Rooms to be an interesting read, although heavy-handed on the descriptive prose. After a while I felt like I was sinking in the bog that Capote was describing. The main characters were not very belivable - very two dimensional. However, because of the descriptive language, I really felt that I was in the time aplace - I'm just not sure it was a time or place I wanted to be."
2,Overhyped,"Thankfully, this is a short book. While the descriptions are truly literary, the story is rambling, uneven, and poorly told. It is dripping with symbolism, and in my opinion it overpowers the basis of literature: The story. The only comparison I have for it is going to a gourmet chef for a meal, and out of the perfect cut of meat, he drowns it in sauce, rendering a primecut usless. Very disappointing to say the least."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!","This is the dullest, most boring and difficult to follow book I have ever read. I wish I could stop reading it but I always finish a book no matter how bad it is. I can't even begin to describe how boring it is, I'd rather read the back of the shampoo bottle. UGH!!"
4,Flood of imagery,"I found myself swimming amidst a flood of imagery which was beautiful yet tended to distract me from the story line. I, being from Louisiana, felt that Capote's work creates the ambience of this region in a very effecive manner - gravel roads and moss laden trees included. I found, however, that the characters tended to be of the surface and Capote denied us the depth of thought and feeling with the exception of Joel. This was truly an amazing feat for Capote as his first novel and I can say that I enjoyed the beautiful imagery thoroughly."
4,Great language and imagery,"Although it starts off a little on the slow side, it picks steam rapidly and spirals into ever more surreal and tragic territory. To be frank, I just finished it and am still trying to sort all of it out (the significance of the title, a possible mental breakdown in the main character's perspective, potential pederasty). A surprising amount of references to gender identity and homosexuality also are found throughout the text as well. However, the two best things about this novel are its well-drawn, often bizarre characters and its beautifully descriptive language. After putting down the book, even though I felt emotionally drained, I simply basked in the afterglow of the experience for a while. Strongly recommended."
3,SOUTHERN GOTHIC,"Granted this book is not for everyone, but for those who enjoy eccentric Southern yarn, this is a real find. Frankly, I don't count myself one of those, but I can appreciate what Capote was trying for and at times you get a glimps of his future brilliance. The protagonist Knox, is obviously Capote, and it's interesting to explore his thoughts. Like I said, not for everyone, but if you are someone who appreciates southern gothic, or has an interest in the singular Capote, then I think you will get something out of this book, if not..well stick with In Cold Blood, or The Glass Harp, but Other Voices, Other Rooms is where you will find the real Capote."
5,An Excellent book! Truman Capote is a genius,"I'm almost finished reading Truman Capote's ""Other Voices, Other Room, and I must say that this is the best book I have read in a long time. This is the first Truman Capote novel I've read and boy!! IT IS EXVELLENT. It is the story of a young boy's search for his father. It is a sad story, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. TRUMAN CAPOTE IS A GENIUS!!!"
2,A Let Down,"Truman Capote is one of my favorite writers, but I thought this book had none of the life and charm of his other books. The writing is too self-conscious. The symbolism is heavy-handed (the broken sun-glasses representing the protagonist's view of life being altered. Contrived!) For this book he was trying too hard to be literary. Capote's subsequent writing was more natural, and was brilliant."
5,This Story Touched Me,I read this book a few years ago and it truly touched me. I could not put it down and read it in one sitting. I still have it and and although I never read a book twice I won't ever part with it. I have read all of his books and all I can say is that Capote was a genius.
5,The Complete History of Hockey Night in Canada,"If you grew up listening to Foster and Bill Hewitt, Danny Gallivan, Ward Cornell, Ed Fitkin and Jack Dennett, this book is must reading. Scott Young, the author played a large role in Hockey Night in Canada on radio on the Hot Stove portions of the broadcasts during intermission. He takes a loving look at Canada's highest rated program on CBC and probably in Canadian broadcasting history. Everything is in it from the politics with the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs with the CBC and their choice of announcers to Esso gas station attendant, Murray Westgate's, ""Always look to Imperial for the best!"" tagline at the end of every hockey broadcast. Growing up watching Hockey Night in Canada in Detroit, (Windsor, Ontario was just across the border) we never knew why some changes were made on ""HNIC,"" but now I do. I sure do miss Foster Hewitt doing the 3-star selection which were the two goalies, and Dave Keon!"
4,sludgey,"This is the major label debut for Rabies Caste-and it is quie good.The music is pure sludgecore,but the vocals arnt snarling and growling-as you would expect from a sludge band-oh no,they are distorted which gives,at least a different (un)welcome(?) effect.The thing that caught my ear on this album is the snare drum,it is very noticible(more so than on other bands albums) and sounds fudgin awesome.The music is mid paced and only seems to go fast when the drummer goes crazy as a mofo.i would recommend this to anyone who wants to get into sludge,cos the best way of describing this is ""accesible sludge"".Good stuff."
4,Great 2-pack,"I'm actually excited this 2-pack came out. The Hobgoblin figure is a repaint of the one that came out in the Web Fliers series but instead of the ridiculous, big plastic cape, it comes with a cloth one making it easily the best Hobby figure ever! PLUS...it comes with the glider that the Web Flier Goblin came without. SWEET! The Spidey is great too. A lot of collectors wanted this Spider-Man done because it's based on Alex Ross' original designs for the Spider-Man movie. All we need now is an Alex Ross Green Goblin figure. Get this 2-pack!"
4,Hoggy needs a change,HI! this toy would have been cool if they have paid attention to Hoggoblin. The looks are ok! even the faded color skin is cool. what's so dissappointing about him is his cape made of a piece of cloth and he even don't have any pumpkin bombs. About Spiderman everything is great. neverseen one before a real collector's item catch the color and is unusual red and black tandem. That makes him great superb.....
2,Look great....but [flimsy],"These figures look spectacular and my kids loved them, but they're [flimsy], with plastic joints that break very, very easily, even after a fall onto a carpeted surface. I've already exchanged one pair, Amazon was great!, and I don't hold out much hope for the second.If you've got boys like mine, these toys will not last long."
5,The Best Value,"For me this is the best choice of oil filters. Obviously, I change oil myself. So, the fewer times I do, the more time is saved. This extended life filter is good for about 10,000 miles. Along with this filter I use Mobil-1 synthetic oil. It too has longer life.Far from an expert on car care, I have never had a problem with any of my vehicles owing to engine oil over hundreds of thousands of miles."
2,Don't get your hopes too high,"Don't get your hopes too high - you probably are not going to get knobs and pulls as shown on the picture and stated in the description.So far, after 3 emails, - no success getting the pulls, which this order was for. I received only the knobs, that I have no need for."
4,"good, but more for collectors","there are two songs that aren't on another cd on this cd. now granted all of the songs are good, this is more of a collectors item. so anyone who is really into Gob should pick up this cd for sure, anyone else should just download some rip-off bootleg version from the internet."
4,Enjoyable read,Although I am not a wrestling fan I found this book really interesting because it says a lot about not only the world of wrestling but our nations culture. The book is well written and thought provoking.
4,Good fit,product is as described; pretty good choice for a replacement. It seems to be made of the same material as the original parts so it may not last .
1,Still waiting,I was called about ten days after purchasing Item and said it must have got lost in transit. They were nice enough to reimburse me some money but still waiting for part about 3 weeks now.
4,good product,"It fits tight. But I got a mark inside when installing, since I did not push the hook first, and pressed it against the base."
2,AVOID product fit was too tight,"The piece was too tight and required LOTS of shaving for the lock mechanism to work properly. Essentially it was squeezing the handle piece so much that the lock would not fully lock or unlock. It took over an hour of fiddling and shaving for it to work properly. In addition the shipping is way overpriced for this item. The color was almost an exact match though, thus I gave it two stars but I would look elsewhere for a piece actually cut right for your Camry. [mine was a 1999]"
4,Nice collection of recipes,"The Minimalist Cooks Dinner is one of Bittman's smaller cookbooks, comprised of about 100 recipes that were previously published in his Minimalist column in The New York Times. This is a solid collection all-around, with a lot of interesting dishes that were new to me, although a few of the recipes -- green salad, boiled rice -- may be too simplistic for anyone but the beginner cook. I did learn a couple of wonderful new techniques from this cookbook that I have since incorporated into my regular repertoire, such as cooking pasta risotto-style and pan-roasting boneless chicken breasts. Most of the recipes I tried from the book were very successful; the only failure I can think of was the 60-Minute Bread, but I have never had much luck with Bittman's baking recipes.If you don't already own a Bittman tome like How to Cook Everything, this book would certainly be a good introduction to his cooking style, and a lot less daunting to get through."
2,Vegetarians Beware!,"Mark Bittman's ""How to Cook Everything"" is a treasure trove of vegeterian recipes, including tons of recipes for cooking legumes, grains, and vegetables. Unfortunately, those sections are all missing from ""The Minimalist Cooks Dinner,"" which is essentially about cooking meat, poultry, and fish. Vegeterian Bittman fans would be better off sticking with ""How to Cook Everything"" and/or trying out ""The Minimalist Cooks Vegetarian."""
3,beware of overlap recipes from How to Cook Everything (HTCE),"The recipes alone deserve 5 out of 5 stars. However, since I own both HTCE and the two Minimalist volumes, I was chagrined to find overlap between HTCE and each of the Minimalist books. The Minimalist books do not overlap.Save your money-- I recommend only buying HTCE. If you are interested in the other non-overlapping recipes, borrow the book from friends or libraries.The Minimalist cooks dinner has a much more user-friendly layout, organization than HTCE and the first Minimalist book. An ideal Bittman cookbook would be all of the recipes from his books together, with the layout and organization of this volume. That would be a truly incredible cookbook, but alas, I keep on dreaming..."
5,More than recipies... Advice to use of what I've got.,"Why do you want to buy a cookbook? If you're a restraut chef or caterer who needs to add several very high quality, very repeatable recipies to their menu, then this book is likely not your best choice. However, if you're an ordinary person who buys what's on sale at the grocery store, wants to emprovise to use what they've got in the refridgerator, and doesn't mind an ocassional dish coming out only so-so, then this is a very good book. It doesn't include instructions for everything (like Joy of Cooking or How to Cook Everything), but does include about 200 very good recipies, each with explanations of what purpose the ingredients serve and suggestions for substitutions, ways to kick it up a notch, or skimp on prep time. That's what makes this such a useful book."
5,The Best,"I own and use both of the major Italian conjugated verb books: ""501 Italian Verbs"" and ""Webster's New World 575+ Italian Verbs."" While both are very good, this one surpasses them. When I have not been able to find a verb in either one I have invariably found it in the ""Green Book."" It would be a valuable addition to your libary of Italian books."
2,Almost Works Fine On Kindle Fire,"I have a first-generation Kindle Fire and the book and verb charts work fine: AS LONG as you turn the kindle landscape (wide). If it's portrait (vertical), it's too small to read.BUT, in actually using this book last night (as opposed to playing with layout and declaring it good to go) I'm revising my review. There is ZERO way to actually go to the verb you're looking for. The publisher didn't take the time to create a real TOC. Instead they reference ""page numbers"". The internal hyperlink ""page numbers"" would be okay if it gets you even close to the verb you're looking for. But when I want a verb starting acc- and end up in the P section, that's just no okay!Either the TOC is broken or the publisher just didn't care enough to do it right. I haven't decided if I'm keeping the Kindle version or not but I will be buying the print edition. The content is excellent, formatting sub-par."
1,not a good kindle buy,I was very disappointed with this book after having used it extensively in hard copy for many years - the indexing system makes it near impossible to use it as a ready reference - will be seeking a refund
4,Seems to work,Haven't had a rock hit yet... but the plastic is thick enough that it should do the trick
3,One cover cracked during installation,One of the tabs cracked when I snapped the cover on my light. I was able to rotate the cover to keep it on the light so I didn't return the item but I'm not overly impressed.I would still buy another one since replacing one of these is still cheaper than replacing a light lense
2,These books did not hold up well after 38 years.,"I read these books when I was in the 5th grade and I enjoyed them then, not so much now. They are strictly children's books. There wasn't anything wrong with them they just should only be read by children."
5,Great,"These are book that can be read and enjoyed by the entire family, adults and children, over and over again. They never get old! Makes even the stubbornest reader want to read."
3,A thrilling crime story that makes it too easy for itself...,A great story is mudded by a long series of improbable turns in the storyline: the hero finds everyone he's looking for without much of an effort. A few characters' backstories are unbelievable. Other characters are awfully obnoxious (e.g. Dudley).
4,"Different for Ellroy, but still a good read...",I am in agreeance with the previous reviewer who stated that this book is relatively 'nice' compared with Ellroy's other books. The plot moves along nicely and only falters in its flashback segment to offer some explanation of why 'IT' all happened. A good book that is well worth a read... If you enjoyed other Ellroy novels then you won't be disappointed.
4,"A Good Warm Up for ""L.A. Confidential""","This book is a great lead in to Ellroy's brilliant L.A. Quartet, mainly ""L.A. Confidential."" But this book---a fictional account of the murder of Ellroy's mother---is also a great precursor to ""My Dark Places."" We get a taste of some Ellroy staples: Dudley Smith and his interrogation techniques, as well as the Victory Motel. This book misses a 5-star rating for one simple reason: the ending is just too simple. Everything falls into place too easily, the ending comes so smoothly it is hardly satisfying. After such a great read, the last part of the book is just too anti-climactic."
4,"""Clandestine"" best seen as a forerunner of LA Quartet","What begins as a virtually straightforward procedural thriller becomes something altogether more nightmarish and is probably the best of Ellroy's early novels. However, the book fails in that the plotting is creaky and in places so extreme in its many lapses into American Gothic overkill that it almost reads as a parody of the LA Quartet which followed. Nonetheless, there is much to be savoured,not least of which is the earliest appearance in print of the loathsome Lt. Dudley Smith (""lad"").The themes, characters and places are very much in tune with the later LA novels and with hindsight this book is definitely a harbinger of what was to emerge in the Quartet"
2,A bit boring...,"I must say that I find this live-cd very boring, there is so much pointless and endless jam here. Very uninteresting. Okey, they had some potential but overall this live performance tends to be LONG boring solos with the guitar-drums-bass line up. I find the Quicksilver Messenger Service ""Happy Trails"" and the H.P. Lovecraft ""Live, may 11, 1968"" to be far, far superior live recordings than this. I would take the singles cd by the prunes instead of this item."
2,Do Not waste your money,"I recently bought this software, thinking it would be something fun to use. I was SO wrong! It continually caused my computer to crash and lock-up. I am sure that it was not a computer problem. Mine exceeds all the requirements of this software. I believe that this is just a really bad software program. Stay away!"
1,SLOW,"This is the SLOWEST coffee maker I have ever used - from the day we bought it, it was slow! It now takes 20 MINUTES to finish a pot. I have tried cleaning, makes no difference. I am buying a new pot (even though this one works fine otherwise) and it definitely will NOT be a DeLonghi"
5,Insightful,"I have read and reread this book many times and still find it one of the most interesting and balanced books on postwar Vietnam. The author, born in England, spent three years in Vietnam as a correspondent for France press.He characterized general Giap as ""ferociously driven, vain, indifferent to battle losses and to the suffering of his people"". He talked about ""the poisoned and scorch earth left by American bombings"", the sepulchral world of the Communist Party of Vietnam with ""its wild menagerie of fiefdioms, provincial power bases..."" and about greed, graft, and nepotism in Hanoi. He also mentioned about ""the melancholy tribe"" of the overseas Vietnamese and noticed Hanoi was ""never magnanimous in victory and tried to erase the very existence of South Vietnam.""When the communist Party claimed to represent the people he talked about ""an absurd act of ventriloquism"" and noted that communist Vietnam was slowly drifting into senescence.Highly recommended."
5,Get the facts behind the headlines!,"This book and memoir ""The Bamboo Chest: An Adventure in Healing the Trauma of War"" by Frederick ""Cork Graham are the best books on Vietnam that my reading club and I have read in the last ten years. Both of them stories that have never been told by any other writers who appear only to be regurgitating the findings of previous writers many of them long since dead. If you really want to know what is behind the veil of secrecy in Vietnam then these ""Shadows and Wind"" and ""The Bamboo Chest"" are the books for you! Both are written by authors who spent more than a year in Vietnam. Graham spent eleven months as the first american political prisoner held in that country since the end of outright fighting."
1,"Tiresome, negative, and unenlightening bore","I bought this book with hopes of learning more about Vietnam. Instead, I waded through Templer's completely negative portrayal of the country and its people. His writing style is dull, and while he tries to support his views with many references, I learned little from this book other than that the author has a very bleak view of Vietnam. One wonders why he spent any amount of time in a place he so obviously detests ... This book was so bad I couldn't even finish it, an extremely rare occurence for me."
4,Awesome Australian Act,"This has to be one of the hottest bands in Melbourne. Amazing instrumental with complex songs that blow you away. This transports you to a different world.Think Mogwai or Godspeed, only better."
4,love it,My daughter loves this bouncer seat. She will actually sit in it and talk while I get stuff done.
2,Too noisy,"We purchased this product for our newborn. We had an older model from 2003 that our twins enjoyed, so we went for the updated model.Maybe I missed something the first time around, but the motor on this model is absurdly loud. So, back to Amazon it goes. Other folks seem to love it, but I would recommend listening to a floor model before purchasing (we did not). Live and learn."
3,Only So-So,"I like that this bouncer has the vibrations switch to help soothe my baby to sleep and I like that it has a removable activities bar. However, when you turn on the bubbles/lights on the activity bar, the noise is incredibly loud. Also, there is no way to lower the noise level on it either. I found my baby didn't like it because it was so loud."
5,Life saver!,Like most new parents I researched everything I bought for my son. I couldn't have been happier with this bouncer. The ocean wonders aquarium bouncer is awesome! I used it from day one. My son wouldn't take naps in his crib during the day but he would sleep in the bouncer. He loved it! He is 7 month's old now and out growing it but I used it everyday until now. It is resonably priced and worth every penny! I never had any trouble with it. It does use batteries pretty fast but so does every other toy you buy. I recomend this bouncer to everyone I know having a baby.
4,"It was good, but my daughter got tired of it very soon.","This bouncer was good, but my daughter got tired of it very soon. The first 3-4 times she was fascinated from the star, fishes and the bubbles. She wide opened her eyes - surprised from the vibrations:-) I thought that finally I have found something that she will enjoy and that will keep her occupied... but it did not work for too long."
3,"great, but cheaply made","my baby loved the strong vibrating motion. for the first couple months, he would be the only place he would nap during the day. i give it three stars because but it's cheaply made - the puppy toy broke after 2 weeks of use."
3,Some small adjustments would make it better,"I used this seat with my baby for her first 10 weeks. During that time she loved it, kicking the pieces to start the music and watching the fish. However as soon as she got the ability to move just a little the seat became unsafe. The belt to keep the baby in is just too small to effectively prevent a child from falling. I would recommend looking for a seat with a more secure restraint system, I have seen them, but I don't know the brands."
1,BROKE 2 TIMES!!!!!,"I registered for this when I had my son. The metal base broke at the bend from the floor base. I returned it and exchanged it for a new one. 2 years later i had a daughter, put together the replacemnt. she is about 6 mths old, 12 lbs and the replacement broke in the same spot?! and just from my daughter rocking it herself, kicking her feet. Be careful."
4,Great except the hanging toys,We got this bouncer to keep at grandmas house and it's great except the hanging toys make an awful noise when you bounce it that is very upsetting to my little girl. There is no way to take them off and they are too low for her to see or to reach for. She loves the vibrating feature and the sounds the top makes and watches the bubbles for long periods of time. The base has a place to bounce it with your foot which is great especially at dinner when you can eat with both hands while your foot bounces her. The only problem is the noise those toys make. If I had known that I wounldn't have gotten it but it's not worth returning it over. Overall we love the bouncer we just wish the toys were removable.
3,It was great for 3 months!..,"I bought this product when my son was 1 month old. At first it was great; he loved it and we did to. But just three months later the sound effect is not working (and it's not the batteries). Instead of gentle sea sound some strange squeaking noise appeared and the bubbles come and go at their will... Also, the switch on the top of the panel was supposed to allow selecting different sound options - this never worked from day 1. Right now we just use it as a seat (took off the entertaining panel altogether). I guess for the money it was an OK purchase."
5,Love it!,"I absolutely love this bouncer. A friend bought it for me and it's been an absolute arm saver. My 3 mo. old is just fascinated with the lights, sounds and bubbles and will actually sit in this chair long enough for me to get myself some breakfast, make calls if I need to or catch up on my housework. The vibration feature in the seat is a definite plus as well. Currently of all the baby gear I have, this one is a favourite and gets used daily.It was easy to put together, the rubber gribs on the frame keep it from moving anywhere, the fabric is bright, colourful and the design keeps him very comfy and in a safe position.An absolute must have!"
3,Makes grinding noise and eats batteries,"About 2 months into using this seat the aquarium part began making horrible clunky grinding noises -- you could hardly hear the music or ocean sounds. It got worse and worse and we finally took that part off altogether. It's too bad, because my baby LOVED looking at the bubbles and fishes. Also, we went through batteries all the time using the aquarium part. It's a neat concept but needs to be constructed more durably somehow."
2,Not what I expected,"When I first saw this bouncer I fell in love wth it! I loved the print and the fish that kiss! My son really liked the vibration. However, it would go through batteries like crazy. I felt like we were changing the batteries every week. My son is 4 months old and he has NEVER paid attention to the fish that kiss. Also, after a few days of using it the bubbles that make the starfish spin stopped coming out so he didn't work. I have since taken the fish attatchment off and I use it strictly for the chair aspect of it. Save your money and buy something else. I was very dispointed with this bouncer."
2,Not the safest,I read a few of the reviews and was glad to know that my baby was not the only one that when fully strapped in fell to the side. I don't know what it is with this chair! We have the kick and play also and it NEVER happened with that one. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it got her to really start reaching and sitting up but as soon as she starting sitting up she tipped over several different times.
2,bad investment,"I registered for this item and was so excited to get it. Within a month of use, the toy bar started rattling very loudly- so much that we couldn't stand turn it on. Fisher price had horrible customer service- I had to end up spending money to get it fixed (even though we had owned it only a month) so when they sent me a new one I just returned it and bought the flutterby bouncy seat- I am EXTREMELY happy with that one!"
3,So-So,"I feel mixed about this bouncer. My son loves the gurgling noises of the bounce, along with the bubbles, lights, music, and vibrating motion. This is a great bouncer and I love all of its features. The only issue that I've had is that it leans back so far. When I first received it it barely leaned back, and now its as if its too far back. My son is only a 2 and a half months old and it seems as if I may not be able to use it long."
2,an inconsistent product,"I've used this with my newborn now for about 5 weeks. After about 2 weeks, the mechanism that makes the bubbles move started making a terribly loud noise, like a grinding, so loud that you can't hear the music over it. I wish I could turn on the music without the bubbles, but all things are on one switch. Then I changed the batteries, and now the vibration for the seat is making a loud noise. Very frustrating. Ironically, my son actually does like the noises and vibrations, so I can't completely pan this bouncer, but being a work-at-home mom, I can't stand turning on the aquarium part. The harsh noise drives me nuts. If you read a cross-section of the reviews here, you can see that others have had this noise problem. I can't recommend this product."
1,have had better!!!,"this was a gift for my second child and i thought that this was a really cute product. but it is not a very liked toy by my baby!! he is four months old and we have used this maybe four times!! the seat that my first born had five years ago, seemed alot safer! this seat has alot of complaints from me!! while the fish are really cute to look at, the back rest of the chair just seems too narrow!! with my first born, there was more of an arch in the back rest and i never had to worry about him falling out, i am too afarid to put my baby in this for fear he will fall over the sides!!! and the staps are way too short!! i would recommend do not waste your money!!!"
1,DANGER,I love the looks of this and the options but it is simply dangerous for small babies. My 2 month old slips over and nearly falls out!!!!!!!!
2,cute but the quality is not so good,"looks cute, the cusion is nice, toys are ok, was a pain putting it together, but all the joints seem very loose, had to improvise and add a few extra screws myself. Guess that's what you get for the money. Haven't used it yet, the baby will be here in two months, we used Baby Bjorn with my first son, he loved it, I got this one just to have something in the ustairs bathroom while I shower, but I wouldn't use it for more than that."
3,Not so great,"This product is not so great the way I expected because it's not so firm, the quality is good and it's beautiful but I thought it was less flexible."
2,neat but not nice,"I received this as a gift for my one month old, we thought it was the coolest thing. Well, if you didnt strap the baby in (and i didnt b/c i always had it on the floor)they always slid sideways. Mine would not take a nap b/c the strap was too small,so i never used it. After 2 months of having it, it starting making the worst grinding noise when the bubbles would start coming up. The motor sounded like it was going to burn up. I also thought that the music was too loud even when we had it on low. I returned it and got the carters sweet daisy cradle and soothe bouncer, we love it and so does my daughter. Since she rules the house now, everyones happy!!"
5,Musical delight for your child.,This is a durable and entertaining necessity for baby. It can be set for music that the little one controls with his bouncing. The aquarium creatures are colorful and keep your baby happy while you get meals ready or yourself.
5,Wonderful Ocean Wonders!,My baby is 2 1/2 months old and absolutely loves this bouncer. He gets so excited watching the little bubbles move the fish and star. He is enthralled--and that gives Mommy time to wash his bottles or send an email or two (or type a user review :) The vibrate function also helps to lull him to sleep.My only complaint is that the bubbles and music stop after about 15 or 20 minutes and he cries when the bubbles stop.
2,Wasted money for us,"We purchased this toy when my son was 3 weeks, prior to buying the swing. My son has never liked this toy. He'd cry within minutes of being put into it. He's also very active, which may be the reason why. There isn't much activity other than the vibrating chair, and watching the water bubble up to music or sounds. He just wasn't interested. If you had to choose between the swing or this due to money or space, I'd choose the swing. He loved it."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!,"I love this bouncer seat! It is so awesome i can put my 4 week old daughter in it when i am washing clothes, showering or whatever and she just sits and listens to the music, sometimes when she gets fussy the vibrations really seem to calm her down! The bouncer was really worth the money!"
2,great for the first year........,"I got this as a shower gift for my 1st son 1yr ago. He loved it but maybe a little too much. After about the first 9 months the aqarium part starting making this awful noise when it would make the bubbles, if you would bang on it a little it would stop but it would always start making that sound again. I had another baby a month ago and I brought out this bouncer and it doesnt even make bubbles anymore and the music sounds like the battery is low but they are brand new batteries. So I think this bouncer is great if you only plan on using it for one baby, but if you plan on using it for more than one child find another bouncer =) cute but not long lasting!"
3,Not worth the money,"I was very impressed at first with the LOOKS of this item however looks were deceiving. The vibrator part is soothing. Howeverthe aquarium part didnt last but a few months, quit working. I replaced the batteries. Still didnt work but my guess there is a short in it.The aquarium part is too big & bulky. My son who is 4 mos old likes to see what's going on around him but cant see with that thing in the way.Also, the seatbelt is not very flexible in adjusting and my son can scoot himself up out of it! Cute chair, but all the extra's not worth it."
3,Entertaining for babies annoying sound for adults!,"I do agree with the other reviewers, my son does enjoy his seat, esp the vibration mode..however, the sound is really annoying! The ""bubbles"" sound is so loud that if I am on the phone and it is on in the background people will stop and ask what that noise is! My older kids and husband hate the sound too. I suppose not too bad of an inconvenience if it is entertaining your child. Still, if you are noise sensitive, try it out at Babies R Us first. On a positive note, it is well made. My son is tall and big for his age and the chair seems longer than most, enabling him to stay in it longer. He is now 5 mos and it still fits."
2,unsafe at 6 mo of age,I never write comments...It was fine until my daughter was 6 months old... she was explorative....the seat belt is too thin and did not support my daughter enough....she would go to reach for things nearby ...and basically she could put her head on the carpet floor...still being attached to the seatbelt..she was hanging over....very scary...I ended up having to borrow my sister bouncer chair that had a thicker more secure seatbelt...
1,"Ocean Wonders should be called ""pre-TV"" trainer","We returned this item after one week of use by our 5 month old son. It should be more accurately labeled a ""pre-TV"" trainer as its designed to mesmerize your child without providing him/her with any opportunity to interact with anything. The suspended toys are too far away to play with and they move very stiffly. It's all about the electronics and sounds that your child is apparently supposed to just stare out for endless hours of mindless and physical activity-less ""bliss.""Pass it by."
2,"Seat is OK, Lousy Aquarium","We bought this for an active 3-month-old boy. The seat is handy at times and keeps him reasonably secure/comfortable while we grab a bite, but the aquarium part is a joke! Good thing it is removable. The bubble maker sounds like a machine gun, and the other sounds are tinny and unconvincing. It just gets in the way of him seeing what's around. Maybe other kids are amused by cheap plastic crap from China, not mine. We'll get a real aquarium instead."
1,Very Unsafe,"I got this in my baby shower. I started using it when my baby was 4 months old and started to sit. It is very unsafe. The seat it not good enough at all and the baby is very likely to fall by the side. I will not recommend it t anyone. Moreover, the music, the fish moving nothing worked for me. Only the vibration works."
1,The toy bar is too heavy!!!,"I got this bouncer for my baby shower and I thought it was very cute. After I finished putting it together I realized that in order to put the baby in and out the toy bar had to be removed which is the case with most bouncers. This toy bar is so heavy that it was difficult to take out without having to yank it out. I didn't even give it a try, it made me so nervous that one day if I take it out in order to remove the baby it would fall by accident and hit the baby, that thing is so heavy! I don't want to handle some heavy piece of plastic over my baby's head on a daily basis so I decided to exchange for the Infant to Toddler Bouncer which is great, the toy bar and toys are soft and even though I still have to remove the toy bar it is so easy and it is very light so its not a problem! I've been using it for a while and I highly recommend it!"
2,not a favorite either,I own almost every ocean wonders peice made. My son liked most of these but the bouncer wasn't one he prefered. I received two at my shower and he seemed to like the off brand one better. He would stay in the ocean wonders bouncer up until he was 12 weeks but then I hadn't put him in for a while. When he was almost 4 months I had to put him down so I could clean house and when I put him in it and turned on the noise he was scared of it. Not to sure why but i'm glad i didnt spend the money on it.
2,buzzing noise,I used this bouncer for my daughter when she was 2 months old. After about a month it started to make a horrible buzzing noise. The noise it so loud that I cannot put my daughter in bouncer anymore!
4,Great! wish it had music though,"great seat, cute color could use for boys and girls, has a vibration option but no music. My son doen't like to spend too much time in the seat, he will nap in it sometimes. he doesnt care much for the vibration or the toys that come with the seat. i attached ither toys to the toy bar, which he likes better and which he can actually reach. the seat is small and bounces well. its small enough to take with us when we go to see grandma, doesn't take too much space in the trunk. overall i'm very sutisfied with my purchase and for a good price!"
5,A must have!,"As a first time mom, I wasn't sure if I needed this, but let me tell you...it's a lifesaver. She wasn't too keen on it at first, but when my daughter was about 1 month old this little item allowed me to take her with me while i ate, worked in the yard, folded laundry, took a shower...glorious!! I was able to wash the cloth part of the seat in the gentle cycle, and then line dry it so it was really easy to maintain.b"
1,Not Well Laid Out,"Great colors, great idea but not well laid out. First off, we figured out how to adjust this bouncer so that it sits up more...if you hold the back bar on the ground with you feet you can pull up the seat and it will bend to a more upright position pretty easily. As for the toy bar, it is so far away that the child can't reach it...at six months old we finally just got rid of ours because our daughter couldnt' stand to be in it where our first daughter had one that she could reach the toy bar when she was very little. The vibration is a bit rough but she seemed to like it. Overall I would never buy it again. I prefer that the toy bar be in reach so they can set off the music and i don't have to do it every five seconds."
3,"Ok, but might buy another company's bouncer next time.","I'd be lost without a bouncer, its the only way I can set my daughter down to take a shower. She really enjoys the vibrating (I don't think she'd like a swinging motion as well as this), though it gives her the hiccups every time she's in the chair. The only problem is the bubble/aquatic sound seemed to be loud and broken after only 3 weeks of use. The bubbles are so loud that you can't hear the music. The company did sent me a replacement part for this problem. But after a few more weeks of use, the new part did the same thing. I might recommend going with another company's bouncer, if there are any out there that play music."
1,Hate this seat my daughter hung off the side while still buckled,My daughter started wiggling and fell out the side she was still buckled in!! She was only 4 months old so not like I had a 1 year old in it!! ALso they can not reach the toys until they are 1 year old!!
4,Your baby will love this bouncy seat!,Wonderful seat. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 star was because I wished it folded up a little better and the bar can stick a little getting it in and out. Other than that this seat has been a godsend. We started using it when she was only a month old. She would even sleep in it without the light bar too. She was a very colic baby and she loved this...believe me she didn't love much in those colic weeks either!DP
5,Awesome boucy seat,"For the price it is great! I would recommend it even if it were more! My daughter first used it just without the fish. We turned on the vibrator and she was happy. When we put the fish on she just stared away. It even made her giggle. I love that the fish are removable for easy feeding or something. This is great, easily washed too!"
5,Great Bouncer,"I initially bought the Rainforest bouncer but wasn't too happy with it. The hanging toys hung way too low and were made of a hard plastic. My baby got his foot stuck in them. I returned it for this one and my baby boy loves it. He smiled immediately at the puppy when I turned it on and watched it the entire time then went to sleep. I actually liked the idea of this bouncer because the puppy is more upbeat rather than soothing like the other bouncers so my baby gets some playtime. By the time he gets tired, the puppy and music shuts off and he sleeps peacefully in the vibrating chair. My ONLY minor complaint is I wish the ball on the toy bar cracked or squeaked. But overall, a terrific purchase!"
1,The Ten Bouncer,"I purchased the Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer this morning. After ten minutes of use the music started skipping. It kept playing about five seconds of one song and then started right back at the beginning of that song. I have read a few reviews, and all of them keep saying the same thing, that the music gets really loud after awhile. Well, now the music is not loud, it just plays two tunes of a song over and over and over."
3,Great! But Watch out!,I was given the seat as a gift for my daughter. It was a real life saver until she started to get a lot of movement. We she got to where she could move even the smallest amount she would fall over the side and be stuck hanging up side down from her wiast. My Sister also had the same problem with my nephew in the exact same seat. So don't leave your child unattended in this seat not even for a split second.
2,"1st one was a charm, 2nd was a dud","I received 2 of the Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncers for my baby shower as I am having twins. After putting the 1st one together I was extremely pleased as it worked great. When I went to go put together the second one I noticed the aquarium had leaked in the package so I exchanged it for a new one at Baby's R Us. The new one I brought home only worked on the vibration setting - none of the lights, sensors or music worked so once again I headed back for a new one. I brought the new one home today and assembled it and what do you know -same thing. The vibration setting worked but none of the other settings worked, and yes I tried different batteries both times to make sure that was not the problem. Obviously a flaw with the product. Tomorrow I will be returning this bouncer for good with no plans to buy this one again. I think striking out 3 times is enough for me. Be Warned!!!"
2,scary music!!!!!!,"My son hates the music in this bouncer. He hates staying in it pretty much and i have to rock him in it to make him feel comfy. I registered for this because I heard it was magnificent. The play pen that matches this is very nice, but the music in this chair is the biggest turn off. It isn't soft and gentle, like other things we have. The music is clunky and low, almost eerie and mystifying, my son looks as if he is going to cry when I turn it on, so I put it on the ocean sounds instead. He is also uninterested in the fish and water scene, whereas he loves the ocean mobile on the matching playpen, which also has softer music, go figure!!!!! I would not recommend thisproduct, but the playpen is wonderful and colorful."
5,A must have for a new baby,"My son (4 months) absolutely loves this bouncy seat! He plays in it and sometimes falls asleep in it. We has used this item since he was about a month old. A relative let us borrow an older one, but it seemed like the incline was too steep to put him in it, so we went out and bought this one. This bouncy seat has been a winner since the day we put him in it."
4,Keeps Baby Bouncing,"My 4 month old loves this seat. He enjoys the bar that has the floating fishes. He also like the toys that are attached to the bar because when he kicks them, a different sound comes out everytime.I have to agree that the straps are not great. At 4 months, he is a big boy and I have to fight to attach the straps on properly. Also, in order to get him in the bouncer seat when he was a newborn, I bought the Snuzzler Infant Support by Kiddopotamus. This secured him in the seat without having him flop over from side to side."
2,Fun But Not Safe,"My daughter, four months old, loves this bouncer and is very entertained in it. The problem is that when I had her in it she got her toe stuck between the hanging green sea creature and the yellow piece that spins on it because all she could do at the time was hit the piece with her foot. Now that she can reach the piece with her hand she gets her finger stuck in it. It has not caused and lasting marks but has pinched her skin as well as scared her. I have to be right next to her when she is in it. I would be careful buying this seat or any others that do something similar!"
3,Straps are TOO Short,"My son is only three months old and already the snaps to buckle him in are almost too tight. The straps NEED to be longer. The toys dangle TOO LOW. The one with the roller hits my son's leg when he swings it. Other than that, my baby does find this bouncer amusing. It will hold his attention for a while. It's light enough to carry around the house so you can sit the baby down in the kitchen to do the dishes, etc."
5,Good Bouncer,"I got this bouncer for my daughter from my baby shower, I really liked it. I used it daily until my daughter outgrew it at about 5-6 months old maybe? She never really liked her swing, but for the first 2-3 months of her life I could only take a shower if I brought her into the bathroom with me in this seat."
4,Wish I had this instead of Grandma,"My mom recieved this item from a friend, and I have the infant to toddler rocker 2005. My daughter loves the Ocean Wonders, she can sit in it for quite a while just smiling, cooing, and sleeping. It is far easier to entertain her with this than the one we have at home. I wish I would have recieved it like I asked instead of my friend buying the rocker cause it was on sale.!!!!"
5,A life saver!,This bouncer has been a blessing for both my son and his parents. Ever since I recieved it when he was 2 weeks old he can't get enough of it. He is now almost 2 months and nothing soothes him better then the calming vibrations and sweet songs this bouncer creates. He is just starting to notice the bubbles and moving fish but they are already entertaining to him. I can't wait to see what comes in the months ahead! I completely recommend this bouncer to any parent of a new little one.
2,Be careful!!!!!,"At first my baby boy enjoyed this bouncer, HOWEVERWARNING: he ended up HEAD DOWN (hanging over the side still strapped in). Although the vibration, soothing sounds and the ocean acquarium are GREAT, I would not have bought it if I knew that my boy would be hanging head down from it. What a scare !!!My baby boy is 4 months!"
2,"Not a ""fun"" bouncer","If you are looking for a bouncer that will entertain baby, look somewhere else. This bouncer is more for calming baby with the water noices and lullaby songs. My brother-in-law has the Kick N Play bouncer which I like much better because baby is rewarded for her actions with lively songs and big, colorful lights to stimulate her. On the Ocean Wonders Bouncer, the bubbles in the bar and water sounds or lullabies will activate when baby plays with one of the two toys, but my 5 week old doesn't play with the toys yet and that doesn't seem like a very exciting reward for her, especially when she gets older. She can make the Kick N Play work already by kicking her feet. Also, one of the two small lights in the top part of this bouncer has already burnt out and it's only been in use for about 4 weeks."
5,What a life saver!,"I put our baby in this seat when I just have to get things done and dont have time to entertain her myself. She loves to watch the fish and when she kicks, the music comes on for her. She could sit in there forever! It is a lifesaver when I have to take a shower and she is wide awake. I just strap her in and she is happy until I am done. I have to say that the vibrating option is for older babies. It scared her when I tried it the first couple of times. Now that she is almost 4 months old she is just at the stage where she will tolerate it."
1,Don't bother if your baby's a mover,I would not recommend this seat for any baby that moves at all. We've tried it twice and our son keeps falling over the sides. It doesn't recline enough. We're using a hand-me-down now that he loves and stays in.
3,Loved the older version...Newer one is already bad...,"I purchased this in the older version for my first daughter who is now 2.5 yrs old. She loved this and would giggle, laugh and kick her feet at the fishies. My husband and I grew so accustom to the music that we sort of missed it when she out grew it. Naturally, when we found out we were having twins the second time around, I wanted to get this bouncer to match the first one. I am disappointed with this version, however. First the strap for the seat is not big enough to completely strap them in. So, I cannot put the bigger twin in this one. SEcondly, the fish have already stopped bubbling. Our first one is still going strong. I've changed the batteries, and checked all the connections, but the fish won't bubble and the music is sounding awful. I'm quite disappointed with this second version. If I could purchase a different one, I would."
1,Poor Design - Do Not Buy,"My recommendation is do NOT buy this bouncy seat. We have twin girls and neither one of them have been able to sit in this. When we put them in, they fall to the side and can't get back up. When they were little, I put one of the girls in it, went to grab something, came back within a couple seconds and she was hanging over the edge. Luckily she was strapped in and the staps did work well, but it was still a scarry feeling to see my infant dangling off the side of this seat. It appears to lean forward too much and neither one of them could stay upright in them. Even now that they are sitting up almost completely on their own, if they lean over just a little bit they fall sideways and can't pull themselves back up. I would recommend the Fisher Price rocking chair that has a vibration mode on it as well. This rocking chair can also be used as a toddler. My girls have loved these chairs."
3,"good seat, not so good toy placement","This worked well for a while, but at three months, my daughter gets frustrated because she cannot reach the toys. By the time she'll be able to reach them, she will most likely have outgrown the seat."
4,Very Useful,"We received this as a shower gift and have enjoyed using it with our son. The assembly was easy with great instructions. The fabric is bright and cheerful and very well padded. My son weighed 7 lbs/7 oz and I have used it since his birth. I haven't had any issues with him slipping or sliding around. I just adjust the harness as needed. A great feature is that you can use the vibration for the seat with or without the music/sounds and lights. It is a great soother and entertaining for our son. At times he is overstimulated by the fish and the lights so we sinmply remove the toy bar. That's a great feature that allows for a variety of uses. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that you cannot use the music/sounds/fish seperately; they must be used together. Overall, we are very satisfied!"
4,good product,"Comfy seat, baby enjoys the fish,water,music & vibration.Vibrations is quietOnly flaw is the toys come of to easily they seem to fall off everytime my son sits in the seat."
4,"excellent baby item, only one complaint","Love this bouncer! On our 3rd baby and all 3 of them have loved this seat. I have washed the fabric seat dozens of times and it has not shrunk, faded or worn in any way. It's very easy to slip off for washing as well. My ONLY complaint is the water level has dropped to about half what it was when purchased 6 1/2 years ago. It's unfortunate that Fisher-Price makes such a great product that lasts the test of time as far as the fabric, construction and electronics go. Wish they could make one that doesn't lose water. I figure the star and the fish will stop spinning/moving as the water level continues to drop."
2,Disappointed ...,"Found this much cheaper at Sears. Based on reviews, gave it a try since the price was reasonable. Am disappointed because there's not enough back support and baby scrunches down into it, with her chin resting on her chest. Not comfortable. Also, was hoping the accessories would detach (some do) and/or at least be colorful, but they're boring. Not stimulating. Would not purchase this again. It does bounce well, though. :)"
2,Watch your step around this bouncer!,"We do like this bouncer except for one design flaw. The legs stick out too far! Nearly everyone that has come to our house has tripped over the legs. I broke my toe on it yesterday. We have now moved it to a place in the house where no one will can walk past it. I think the legs should be more like the older Aquarium bouncer. We had that one with our last son and none of us tripped on it.Beware!""Not a clumsy mom""Houston,Tx"
4,I love this bouncer!,I love this bouncer. This bouncer is so soothing to my baby because the vibrations are so strong. You can visibly see her little toes vibrating! I keep it in the bathroom and it keeps her happy the entire time I am taking a shower and getting ready in the morning. She is 10 weeks old now and I still haven't had to change the batteries!
4,my son loves it,The Aquarium Bouncer is a great item for my son. The first time we put him in it his eyes got wide and he was totally amazed by it. He loves to watch the plastic fish move around and likes the sounds it makes. It can be a little over-stimulating for him though. He usually only spends 5-10 minutes with the aquarium part on it. But he will spend longer periods in the chair without the aquarium attachment. It is a great seat for him when he's watching his Baby Einstein DVD.
3,Was a 4 until the other night!,"We loved this chair for my daughter through 3 mos. She was amazed by the bubbles and spinning star fish. The mode that makes the item turn on by the baby kicking the hanging fish allowed her to realize cause and effect. At 3 mos. my daughter started to pull herself up to try to sit in an upright position and as she pulled up she would lean to her right side. One evening I placed her in the chair right in front of us as we were talking and she leaned her whole upper body over and was upside down for a few seconds until we grabbed her. The baby was not hurt but it shook me up badly at the sight of this.I have never written a review on a product before but I felt so stongly to let other parents know what happened right before our eyes.My suggestion, great chair from birth to the time they start trying to sit up which was 3 mos. for our daughter."
2,DO NOT BUY FOR AN ACTIVE BABY!,"This chair was great at first. It is lightweight, so easy to tote around from room to room. My daughter seemed to like the vibrations and the fish. However, at just a few months old, she learned how to tip herself over - while strapped in - and hit her head on the floor. Luckily, she was on carpet rather than tile - but it definitely made my heart jump! My parent's have the same one for their house and my nephew also did the same thing. I think Fisher Price should recall this chair until they can put a better harness in. If that part was safer I think this chair would be great! I bought the entire Ocean Wonders line... love the highchair and pack-n-play, but have had problems with this and the swing."
5,Provided us quiet time during diner time,"We loved that bouncer seat! We put our baby in it during diner time and she would seat quietly with us (most of the time). It was great also when she needed to nap during the day but didn't want to be in her bed. Now at 5 months old, we don't use it that much anymore but I recommand to any new parent."
2,My baby nearly fell out,"This was a great bouncer until my baby was moving around more (3 mos). She nearly fell out of it twice. Luckily the belt kept her in but her movement caused her to get sideways and hang off. Once was a fluke, twice is a pattern and I no longer use it. I believe that it sits too upright and does not envelop her enough like the newer (papasan) styles."
1,Not comfortable at all!!!!!!!!,We bought this item for our 3 month old and the minute you would put him in it he would scream the whole time----the vibration mode is way too loud and crazy---the fish and music is cute but not enough to torture a child in an uncomfortable seat that is straight and stiff----we bought Carters Baby Bouncer--Baby Vines and it is fabulous---it is comfortable and snuggles them in----it has vibration mode that is just enough and it has 2 music modes---one that is fast music and the other is slower music--it has volume control and even the in utero sound mode!!! Our son loves it and when I take him out he cries to go back in!Don't waste your time on this bouncer try the Carters one!!! Your little one will thank you for it :)
2,mixed reviews,"My son gets bored with the musical bar, it entertains him for about 5 minutes if that. Also never once has he fallen asleep in it. The only thing I use it for is to watch his baby einstein videos. He does like that because when he gets excited over the video he kicks and makes the chair bounce more. I also sometimes use it to feed him in, but the chair alone itself isn't worth the money. My child is way to observant and needs more stimulation than what it offers."
1,Not as good as i hoped,"We got this seat as a shower gift for our first child. First he could not even sit in this seat till he was 3 months old the seat is at a ridiculously upright angle, to much for a newborn to sit in. So all it did was sit and collect dust for 3 months. Second the bar didnt hold my sons attention at all. The vibrations didnt work that good. And the fabric was pretty scratchy. Also my son was a large child 9 lbs 6 oz at birth so he grew very rapidly by the time he was able to sit in this seat he was almost 15 lbs and the bars that are supposed to keep this seat upright would start to bend and reshape. By the time my son was 5 months the bars where so misshapen he was practically laying on the floor. I would not recommend this seat to anyone. We are expecting our second child in a few months and have gotten the leap frog learning seat which we like a million times more."
2,Not for a larger baby,"I bought this as it had good reviews. My baby was 9 pounds 4 ounces. He hated it from the start. At 2 months he finally used it but it never kept him very interested. So he was never in there long. At 4 months he was too heavy and would lean too far back. I would have returned it but my husband threw out the box. Also the toy bar blocks your view of the baby so you don't have eye contact. Also mine made a horrible rattle sound if you took the toy bar off, but that may just have been a defective one. I wanted to return this but my husband threw out the box. I felt it was a waste of money. I guess it might be good for smaller babies. I have now purchased the Baby Einstein Discovering Water Rocker/Bouncer and love that. It can hold up to 40 pounds so you will get more use out of that."
4,Exactly what we needed.,"I didn't give this bouncer 5 stars because when setting the vibration to ""on"", it doesn't automatically start -we have to hit it from underneath to make it vibrate. Our son loves his bouncer. Originally we had the fisher price Ocean Wonders but left it at grandma's house and we decided to get an inexpensive bouncer (since the Ocean Wonders one cost about $60). He likes the music and especially the little dog, bee and sun when they light up. He also loves to grab the little animals from underneath. When our son wants to take a nap, we take off the animals part and just bounce him manually and a few minutes later he'll fall asleep. Definitely recommend it."
4,Product is Fine,"We had an older Fisher Price bouncer hand me down, I was expecting this one to be right in line with that one. Unfortunately, the vibration is much weaker on this model, and it is a little harder to bounce. That said, the construction is quite sturdy and my baby loves it, which is really all I can ask for."
3,Just all right...,"This is definitely the lower end of this type of product. The music function is tinny and annoying and there is not much to engage the baby. My baby was actually upset when I put him in it because he was used to the Fisher Price Acquarium bouncy seat, which he loves. Spring for the more expensive seat, it is well worth it."
4,Life saver!,"Wow. My son loves this bouncy seat. Not only does it entertain him, but also he finds it comfortable enough to fall asleep in. We use this every day. A godsend for when Mommy needs to shower or run out front to grab the mail or make dinner.I like that the music/power controls are atop the ""screen"" and not at my child's feet. There are a variety of options for sounds and music. The seat can be put on a baby-operated mode so that it will only make sounds as long as baby is kicking the toys or bouncing in the seat. If baby falls asleep, the sounds turn off.The fabric on the seat comes off easily and can be thrown in the washing machine. Very easy to clean.The reason I give it four stars, not five, is that it gobbles up batteries."
3,Don't recommend it.,"We bought this item second hand in like new condition. The vibrations work but the chair isn't really made to support a newborn, baby kind of just fell over to the side because the chair isn't made to cradle baby's little head and shoulders. The attachment is probably not going to be turned on. It looks great and has lots of bright colors and little toys to kick, but the bubbles are LOUD like a machine gun. It's crazy. And the water in the aquarium is half evaporated with no visible leak. I'd shop around."
4,Terrific and safe !,"We got this as a gift and another one. This is great for laying your very wee one in after they fall asleep and also for some active play...they get transfixed by the gurgly bubbly water sounds and moving fish etc. I highly recommend as long as they are under 3 months...the base is heavy and sturdy so it doesn't feel like it will tip even when baby kicks hard. The drawback for me was the baby kicks the hard blue plastic poles that hold up the aquarium part...I fixed the problem by cutting the toes off a pair of my husband's athletic thick socks. One sock per pole and he can kick safely. FP should pad those poles. Also, this price seems high ...I've seen it cheaper and check your local craigslist. *it does not adjust so we use a different bouncer chair for more active playtime where he'd like to 'sit up'."
3,Green Meadows bouncer - hard toys only,"I ordered the fisher price green meadows bouncer from Kaplan because the photo showed it with soft toys. I contacted the seller to make sure the toys were soft toys before ordering it and the answer was yes. Unfortunately when it arrived, the toys were hard toys. I contacted the seller who apologized and sent me a return label within a week.I am very disappointed because I want a bouncer with soft toys but can not find one. It seems that nowdays all of the bouncers have hard toys. I am keeping this bouncer because I can't find another one with soft toys so I'll have to buy some soft toys to exchange the hard toys...I am wondering why only a couple of years ago all the bouncers had soft toys and now they all have hard toys?"
3,Satisfied,"My son is not a big fan of being stationary. So anything that I have to buckle him into is not his favorite. However, he has spent a considerable amount of time in this seat while my husband and I eat dinner or whenever I have a less time consuming task to take care of.I do like the bouncer myself. It's very cute and now that my baby has figured out how to turn on the music, he might be more willing to spend some time in it.Also it would be nice if the attached toys were interchangeable with other toys."
3,A fun bouncy seat,"We needed a 2nd bouncy seat and went down the line several stores waiting for our daughter to light up when she sat in the right chair. This was the one. As soon as I sat her in it, her little face lit up and she giggled. However, since buying it, she gets bored and frustrated with it very quickly. I think she gets tired of hearing the songs. She likes to watch the dog shake and the lights blink but I think she gets aggitated after listing to the sounds over and over. The cat and the bunny are still out of her reach. I also use it as a feeding chair by taking the toy bar off and laying a towel over it. She seems to like it just as much without the toy bar on too. It reclines her just enough but not too much. I gave it 3 stars because I think it's overpriced and it needs a mute switch so the lights can still work without the songs...it's not a good sign when the baby gets annoyed by the sounds too."
5,INFANT BOUNCER SEAT,THIS WAS ANOTHER SHOWER GIFT THAT OF COURSE I WAITED UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO ORDER IT...AND AMAZON GOT ME THROUGH ANOTHER DILEMMA...THANKS AGAIN AMAZON...PLEASE KEEP UP YOUR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION POLICY. YOU ARE WONDERFUL
2,disappointed,"I gave this bouncer two stars because of the simple fact that the bouncer part no longer works. My daughter is not even 3 months old yet, and the bouncer doesn't work. After about a month we had to start jiggling the on button to get it to work, but now it doesn't work at all. Its too bad because she really loves the fish attachment."
4,Great bouncy seat,"I have been using this bouncer a lot for my newborn. When my hands are tied up or my husband and I are eating dinner, and we cannot hold her, it is a great piece of equipment to use. She is very comfortable in it and often falls asleep in it. The music lulls her to sleep. We never use the vibration option though. She seems to get irritated with it or it gives her the hiccups. She prefers larger motions, so I am hoping that she will like her new Aquarium swing. Will let you know!"
4,Life saver!,My son loves this seat - he just turned 3 months old and is growing out of it. I don't know what I'll do. The lights and bubbles captivate him. I use it sometimes when he is screaming. In a dark room when the lights are more vivid it lulls him right to sleep. The only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is that the bubbles make a lot of noise and it can be pretty annoying. They almost drown out some of the noises offered such as rain and ocean waves. Otherwise its a great seat.
2,Breakable,"My son didin't care for the sounds and music it played and to be honest they weren't very entertaining to myself or my husband. We have recently had to look for a new bouncer because while my son was in it and bouncing away the left side where the bars that hold it up snapped into to pieces...now you can't blame it on the child because his kicking is not strong enough to do that. Also, his weight was not a factor for this to make this possible in any way! I am disatisfied and i'm angry because what if something more could've happen. As it is when it snapped it made it almost flip over and not only that it made it so that his head was not supported up and it had hit the ground. Please don't buy this for your child, it should be a saftey recall and i'm going to try and make it happen, and if you know anyone who has one please inform them of this matter!"
4,Great bouncy seat,"I bought this seat, and one other seat, for my 3-month-old twins after reviewing many different bouncy seats both online and in stores. It is a great bouncy seat! My daughters like it a lot, it was simple to put together, it is easy to move from room to room, and it has been a very safe product. I have never had any problems with the toys scratching my babies as I've read in other reviews. The seat does not seem to be particularly entertaining to them, however, it is a perfect place for them to relax and wind down. They are happy there for 15 minutes or so when you need a break, or a chance to take a shower! The other seat I bought was a Leap Frog Learning Seat. The Leap Frog Seat is much more entertaining, so I feel compelled to say, if you're looking for an entertaining seat rather than a relaxing one for your little one, buy the Leap Frog seat."
1,Be careful with this seat,I was given this bouncer at my baby shower. My baby absolutly loved to bounce in this seat and I really liked it at first. Then one day it broke the bottom piece that sits on the floor snapped in two while the baby was in it and she fell backwards and hit her head on my hard wood floor. This was not the only time I heard of this seat breaking a lady I worked with said it did the same thing with her son in it. So be very careful!!!!
4,Great Bouncer,"My daughter enjoyed this bouncer until she was 8 months old! Used every day! She could even fall asleep in it. The music is very soothing. And she liked to watch the fish and bubbles. She didn't particularly like the vibration aspect. She didn't kick the toys, but she liked to take them off and chew on them as teethers. Easy clean. She also had the cradle swing and crib aquarium, both of which are necessities."
3,Very Entertaining,"I think this is a very entertaining bouncer. The music and the bubbles are great. They are what kept my boys amused. However, they could never really reach the toys. And mine was missing one of the toys that hung from the fish. I called the company and was told that they could not send me the piece because they do not sell it seperatley. I would have to purchase the whole toy bar. It wasn't worth returning for that. And we always seemed to be changing the batteries in the vibrator. I agree with the legs sticking out too far. My husband hit his toes quite a few times!This is one of the first items I had to put away because my boys lost interest."
4,"Good, but with its cons.","I purchased this chair when my daughter was about 4 months old. It was wonderful in the beginning because she was so amazed by the fish. How ever as she got bigger her size became a problem in the chair. She is now 4.5 months old and the little green sea horse that hangs hits her knee/shin everytime the chair is bounced. Also, they can't really reach that toy bar to play with the toys and the red light on top blew out within two days of use and there is no way to change it.I did though love the different sound settings, and the added plus of the vibration on the chair. Its really defentially a wonderful chair for younger babies.I just wish the toys didn't hit my daughter's legs. But other then that I would reccomend this chair."
2,Not very fond of this bouncer,"We received two different bouncers at my shower. I kept this one at our house because it matched his bedroom decor and looked cuter. I sent the different one to the babysitters. Big MISTAKE. My son hated this chair. The music is too slow and mellow, it made him tired to be in it. It was great if it was nap time. Now that I only work part time I got all my stuff back from the sitter, and he loves the other one. I think it the kick and play, it's bright yellow with red, green, blue, and purple lights. He absoutley LOVES it. He hits the toys, talks to it, kicks it, and wants to be in it. We use it to feed him now. I wish I would have known that in the first 4 months of my son's life. I could hacve had a little more free time. The fish really don't do anything to keep him intertained. All in all, it's great if your child is tired. Not something to keep him entertained while you fold clothes."
4,This has been a lifesaver,"After several evenings of non-stop crying and waking from naps early, we started putting our newborn in this bouncy seat and turning on the vibrator. He no longer fusses and will sleep till we wake him. We even use it during the night if we can't get him to go back to sleep in his crib. He's too young for the dog attachment still. The only problem we've had is the vibrator is sometimes louder than others, like something inside is loose. We haven't found the cause yet; it only happens periodically. I also wish it had a feature to make the seat rock/bounce on it's own as opposed to you doing it. He's getting to where he likes both the vibrating and rocking. But we have backup batteries just waiting since we can't live without it; we call it his little recliner."
5,Bouncer is very portable and comfortable,"My baby loves this bouncer. She's now 8 weeks old and she's been sitting in this for a little over 2 weeks now. She loves it and even better, I love it. It's so lightweight and so portable, I move it from the bathroom (so that I can take a quick shower), to my home office, to the backyard (so that she can sit with the family when we eat outside). So far, I've loved it!"
2,Child Falls Out,"My daughter is now 3 months old and has fallen out of this about 4 times. She is strapped in and correctly positioned, but the straps do not hold a baby in place to where she can't fling herself over the side. Just last week I looked over at her and her head was hanging over the side while her feet were still on the bouncer. The toy bar gets old fast, and already she is not interested in it. The only good thing about this chair is the vibration, but definately not worth the $40."
1,Not a good seat.,"My best friend had this for her first daughter, she is now buying a new one for her next child - the seat sits up really straight - and is really high up compared to alot of other bouncys. Her daughter would always slide to the side and almost fall off, so if she was ever in there, someone had to be there right next to her. I would not recommend this seat.The swing, however, is great."
2,not worth the money,"While this is cute and colorful, the toys are too out of reach to be useful. My daughter struggles to grab them and gets frustrated. I've resorted to attaching other toys for her to play with. Take a look at the user pictures, most of them don't even have the aquarium viewer attached, or the child is in a trance watching the bubbles. Find a bouncer that will challange your child as they grow and start grabbing."
4,Loves it!,"My 7 week old girl loves to sit and watch the bubbles and rotating starfish. The vibrations are perfect and generally soothes her.There are only 2 reasons for giving it 4 stars and not 5. The green seahorse that hangs from the aquarium hangs too low where my infant will unintentionally kick it with her shin. We cannot figure out how to take it off without breaking it, so we've elevated it with some rubber bands. The seat is also not as comfortable for infants like the Papasan swing (we have the swing and she sits so snug in it without sliding). She does slide to the side and down when the bouncer is on. We would have exchanged it for the Papasan bouncer for this reason, but the aquarium motions have proven to be priceless. It would also be nice if the aquarium part would remove and continue to work without being attached so we could lean it on the wall of our changing table or other places.But in all, well worth it!"
5,BEST THING EVER!,"1st time mom and this was my saving grace. We used it for 3 months and was worth every penny. My daughter was really fussy and not much of anything calmed her but this bouncer consistantly did the trick. My Daughter LOVED this bouncer. She liked all the toys, sounds and lights. She will now stare at our fish tank for sometimes an hour. The Vibration option ran on 1 C"" battery,for a month. If I used the lights and music which took 3 C"" batteries they didn't last near as long but, she still was calmed by the vibrations and looking at the fish. I had NO problems with this product...read the directions and cautions and you shouldn't have any problems either. I stopped using it when she became stronger and moved more... seemed common sense to me. It's not a heavy duty toy but a very entertaining and calming product. It's not easy or convenient to store after it's put togeather. It doesn't fold up which is the only reason I am getting rid of it now."
4,Great buy!,"It took my daughter a few weeks to appreciate this bouncer, but now it is a priceless tool for Mommy. I have been putting her in it since she was 4 weeks old and now that she is 10 weeks old, she fusses a lot less and can sit in the bouncer for up to 20 minutes! She sits in it while I take a shower or do the dishes. I also remove the bar and sit her down to watch educational DVDs. At first I was nervous and thought the bar would crash down on her head but once she's in the seat, her weight counterbalances the weight of the toy bar and it stays put. You just can't put any additional weight on it. She still does not like the vibration part, so I don't use it."
3,Great for newborns,"Our daughter loved being in this seat from day one. HOWEVER, at 4 months, she lifted herself up and off the side, landing with her head on the floor and feet in the air. So, we don't use it anymore. It suited us very well for 3 1/2 months and I would use it again for the next child."
4,Terrific for your newborn,"We put our son in this bouncy chair when he was only a couple days old and we used it until he was four or five months old (he just got to big and heavy for it). While he didn't seem too interested with the toy bar with the fish, he loved the comfort and vibration of the bouncy chair. I only have a few negatives--the toy bar is too far away for a small infant to look at and the chair isn't very well padded. I always placed a blanket on it, so our son would be a little more cozy. I would recommend this bouncy chair for your newborn baby--it is an essential piece to your must have items."
4,Bouncy chair hater loves this chair!,"We bought this chair for our 4th baby out of desperation. I usually make all my babies spend their waking time on the floor, but our 4th had really bad acid reflux the first few months and needed to spend her time in a sitting position. She hated the swing and the car seat and I was tired of holding her all day. We've had other Ocean Wonder toys and enjoyed them so we gave this a try. We love this chair! It has a very comfy seat and is just the right angle for a newborn. The toy is engaging and captured her attention right away. Now that she is older she likes to sit and kick the toys to make the sounds herself. Our three-year-old climbed on it and it did not get bent out of shape (a problem we've had with past chairs). It does burn through the batteries though. The vibration feature is very soft so I don't always realize it's running when I take her out of the chair--which is part of my battery problem. We really love this chair and would recomend it to anyone."
3,my review,"TROUBLE WITH LEMONS was a good book it was an action adventure book. Tyler and Lymie went to the quarry to swim, a few minutes later they seen a truck pull off and Tyler swam over there then he swam into a body well that all I am going to tell you you'll have to read it your self. I recommend this book to everybody it is a really good book."
2,Trouble With lemons,"Trouble With Lemons seems to me a little boring. I have to admit some parts were funny. To me, the rest, you're about ready to fall a sleep. In the middle of the chapter you look at the clock. You think how long have I been reading? , 10 min. or 10MILLION YEARS! The characters were poorly developed. I would recommend this book to a 4th, 5th, 6th grader or I think it would be an ideal book for maybe for story time. Over all I'd say it was ok"
3,The Trouble With Lemons,"I liked this book for the most part, but it could have been much better. It is about a boy named Tyler who moves to this new town and discovers a quarry. When him and his friend Lymie go to the quarry they end up swimming. When swimming one of them swims into a dead body. As the book goes on the mystery is revealed of who the victim is and who the killers are. This book's plot was very good, but it could have had a little more action and or suspense. Overall The Trouble With Lemons was a decent book"
4,I don't know what to make of this book.,"The book ""The Trouble With Lemons"" is a good book. It's about a kid who has no family at home and is allergic to just about everything. But one night while taking a swim in an abandoned qurry with Lymie,his best friend, he runs into the dead body of Boo Boo Anderson, the school's janator. On top of that, he's got a bully on his back ,and the killers are after him. He quickly becomes friends with Chuckie, the groundskeeper. Together Chuckie, Lymie, and Tyler try to figure out who killed Boo Boo."
3,This was a good book.,"The book was good. It didn't quite put you on the edge of yourseat, but there was still a mystery to the book that kept youguessing. I would recommend that you read it. Have fun reading..."
4,The Trouble With Lemons- An awesome read!,"It is difficult for me to tell you how much I loved this book! There was a number of reasons why this book turned out to be so good. First of all, it taught me a lot of lessons in different areas. The main character, Tyler, thought he had so many problems in his life, but it just so happens that he had everthing to be happy about. I think this matter relates really well with teenagers that are growing up and searching for who they are.Also, this book kept me hooked so well! You might suspect this book is boring because it is just about some kid growing up, but of course it is mixed with a mystery which makes you want to keep reading. Hope you choose this book for your next read!!!!"
2,The Trouble with Lemons,"I give the book The Trouble with Lemons two stars because it was a slow-paced book. It was kind of boring and didn't have much adventure in it. It told too much detail in too short of a book. When reading, I couldn't stay focused and lost interest in it. I thought the beginning was good, but after they found the body, it slows down and jumps to a different subject. I think it would be a better book if it had more adventure in it and it went deeper into the mystery of who killed the dead body. One of the reasons that I liked this book was that it was easy to read."
4,The Trouble with Lemons is very easy reading.,"I give the book The Trouble with Lemons 4 stars. It was a halfway decent book with many surprises. The surprises came suddenly which was great, but afterward there were big lulls and spots where it was hard to stay interested. I loved the character Tyler. He was a kid who thought of himself as a ""Lemon."" He would trade himself in for a different kid that wouldn't get in so much trouble anytime he had a chance. He figured going to the principal twice a week and using Ms. Weavrly's class as naptime weren't things a good kid would do. Then he and his friend Lymie slipped out of the house out and went swimming in the town quarry. Everything was fine until he bumped into the body. It was BooBoo Anderson the school janitor. What were they to do? This book was very easy to read. I would recommend it to any of my friends. It's great for a kid who needs to pass the time."
3,The Trouble!,"Trouble with Lemons by Daniel Haynes is one of the greatest books I have ever read in my life. The protagaonist is a 12 year old boy named Tyler. He would go crazy if he didn't have his best freind Lymie. Tyler had just moved into this little, normal, boring town. Just when he thought nothing goes on in this town, something happens one night that changes his veiw about this boring town forever. The lesson of the story is even how normal something looks, it might not really be that normal at the end. I recommend this book for 12-13 years olds because I think when you are 12 you would appreciate it more."
2,The Trouble with Lemons,I have just read the book The Trouble with Lemons. I thought the book was ok I thought the book could have a little bit better. It was about these two boys who go to the quarry and then they see a car dump off a body and the guy is dead. Then they swear they will never tell anybody about what happened at the quarry. Tyler always gets beat up by this guy named Beaver he doesn't always get beat up but they fought twice. What I didn't like about the book is there was this kid named Tyler who had all kinds of diseases and allergies. I thought if all these problems that maybe you shouldn't be doing a whole lot of stuff.
2,This book is Trouble,"Sorry to say this book wasnt very interesting, nor exciting. I found it to be kind of lame. It really had no BIG climax and was just a boredum through out the whole thing. If your REALLY bored and have nothing else to do then read this book, it kind of makes you think. bBut for a school project or something, its a big no no!"
1,trouble with Lemons,"I did not like the book Trouble with Lemons. I did not like it, because I don't think it was very exciting. The book would have been better if when they were in the pond they found more than one dead body. I recommend that no one should read this book, because it's not that good."
4,hey,good goood gooood goooood gooooood goooooood gooooooood gooooooooood gooooooooood goooooooooood gooooooooooood goooooooooooood gooooooooooooood goooooooooooooood gooooooooooooooood goooooooooooooooood goooooooooooooooooood gooooooooooooooooooood goooooooooooooooooooood gooooooooooooooooooooood
2,The Trouble With Lemons,It was all right. It was not on of my favorite books. I did not the main character he had to many problems. But it was sort of made it better because it was sort and easy to read. You could relate to it because it was about kids our age. It would have been better if it would have had more characters. The mom and brother needed to be home more.
4,French or fussy?,"Chang has never struck me as a particularly individual player, though she is often described as bold. Like the previous reviewer, I thought her Ravel and St-Saens were good, particularly the St-Saens. The Franck suffers from an excess of restraint that sometimes is effective, but elsewhere serves no good purpose and makes the music seem flabby. Canon though it be, the fourth movement of the Franck is not tightly constructed, and benefits from a gutsier approach, emphasizing the emotional rather than structural logic of the piece. All that said, Chang's tone is uncommonly sweet, and her St-Saens is perfectly judged."
4,Franck/Saint-Saens/Ravel: Sonatas for Violin & Piano,"Sarah Chang's lyricism and command of the violin combined with french romantism worked beautifully in this cd.However with her Franck, i often feel that the piano on several ocassions overpowered the violin (especially the 4th movement) and Chang's rendition was rather weak sounding.In contrary, or amazingly, in the d-minor by saint saens, both of them worked wonderfully, were well balanced. Chang and her Del Gesu was the perfect combination for the saint saens.In the Ravel, i particularly enjoyed how Chang phrased his music. Despite the crazy compositon, everything was in place and neat."
2,"Useful, but one-sided","This is not a bad resource for people interested in the subject, because it provides a good -- though very biased - review of the arguments used by those who oppose therapies aimed at helping people who are not comfortable and do not want to become comfortable with their homosexual attractions. Unfortunately, they ignore any researchers, therapists, or clients who support or see benefit in these therapies, while giving the impression that their work is actually a comprehensive treatment of the subject.At the least, I would recommend searching the NARTH website for the names of some of the editors or contributors to this book, to see what scientists and clinicians on the ""other side"" have to say about their work.There is a need for a more balanced book on the subject, that fairly covers all sides of the issue, but of course everyone is more intent on promoting their own sociopolitical stance."
3,Okay,"This is a basic short cardio drill. Good when you are short on time,but experienced exercises may find it too easy."
3,Works great but...,smells rather unappealing.If you're simply after great function then this is a good product- but you won't want to be using it for a fresh and clean smelling ear :-\
1,Sent me the wrong thing,I ordered tongs and got a spoon. It was a stocking stuffer and I had no time to return the item. Very disappointed!
5,Cool and rustic!,"I ordered a set including this towel bar, a tp holder, paper towel holder and hand towel ring. I like all of them and would buy from this merchant again!"
5,Yep,I put this up in the bathroom. I use paper towels to take off make up and cleaning toothpaste off the sink. Very handy. It works next to the wall by the sink.
4,GREAT goggles!,"I had a pair of goggles that left me with what looked like raccoon eyes for a few days. These were described as not doing that, so I thought I'd give them a try. I like the fit, the look and the function of these goggles. I also like the reflective feature giving some protection from the sun."
1,What a horrible movie!,"Other than Erika Eleniak (which does not look her best), Dracula 3000 offers nothing. Set in the year 3000, a space vessel headed by Van Helsing (Casper Van Dien) found a stranded space ship (supposedly has been missing for a long time). Guess what, Count Dracula is on board, awaken by accident and starts killing the crew one by one before final confrontation with Van Helsing, the descendant of the great Vampire Killer.The Ending is horrible, and as I mentioned earlier, Erika is out of shape so if you want to see her in sexy mode, you will be disappointed. She did wear a short leather pants through out the movie though, but I think she has gained weight.Skip this garbage."
1,This is just terrible,"I watched about 10 minutes of this movie and had to turn it off, the year is 3000 <and no this has nothing to do with Dracula 2000, D3k is a standalone piece of garbage> but anyway, the year is 3000, and if the director or costume designer can't come up with a space suit that looks any better than a cross between a gas mask, some diving goggles and some plastic tubing i could buy at the hardware store for a $1.50, why would i want to watch the rest of this trash fest?"
2,Is it really a plain movie?,"I saw this movie with my friends and we all agreed it was a horrible movie, but would make an amazing Porn."
1,"OMG, can it get worse?!?","This movie was absolutely TERRIBLE! And I am a lover of all things horror, especially vampire ones. And I am very forgiving about cheesy story lines, but this is too much.The movie starts with some skitish 5 or 6 person crew. Everyone is whining and fighting. For some reason, they brought a guy in a wheelchair on board a strange space ship.A bad Drucula is found on board. A guy finds out he is a VAnHelsing (which not even Dracual cares about), a sex bot asserts herself, and then the ship explodes without warning.I don't normally give away movies, but I think it is in your best interest to save yourself and your evening."
1,Steve 500055,I must say this movie does'nt even deserve one star! I paid five bucks for this piece of CRAP! I believe that was the budget for this film also. It was not funny even for a bad film. Terrible all around. I won't even go into the plot because the whole thing is a waste of time. This DVD should not be bought. Save your money for anything else I wish I did!!!!
1,Absolutely terrible,"Oh my gosh, you had to know that any film co-starring Coolio was bound to be a major turkey, but ""Dracula 3000"" is arguably the worst ""vampire"" movie ever. Even having Erika Eleniak parade around in tight leather pants for the whole movie wasn't enough to save this. And the ending...????....great strands of garlic Batman, the worst. Evidently, the director and producer must have run out of cash, because the movie just kinda ended...there was no rhyme or reason to the conclusion. This should have gotten a ""Razzie"" for Worst Movie, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Actor (Coolio)."
2,If Only...,"You know, this movie had the potential to be good camp, but sadly, can't even achieve that. What can I say? The plot is lame, Dracula looks ridiculous, and the ending is incredibly stupid. Want more details? Ok, as one person mentioned, it's the year 3000, and space suits are a mix of cheap gas masks and BARE SKIN!! Hello? At least tell us they have some kind of force shield like in Star Trek! I mean, why the hell are they walking into a potentially hazardous environment with BARE SKIN? ARgh!Then there is Drac. In the year 3000, interstellar traveler Dracula is STILL wearing a cape and out dated formal wear. OK.Then the end. The robot turns to the only living member of the crew, mentions that in 12 hours they are going to fly into the heart of a sun, and offers to have sex with him! THAT'S THE END OF THE MOVIE!! What the hell? Let's get laid, then BOOM!ARGH!Watch this only if you are really, really bored. Or a huge Casper Van Diem fan. Nah, even then, it's not worth it."
1,Oh Dear!,"Oh Dear indeed!Never in my days ,so far, have i come across such a veritable pile of execrement, posing as a vampire film!Made on a budget of two dollars fifty there is still change to spare as a random cast of has beens and ""Never-will-make-its""bumble their way through crude and offensive one liners and delayed responses.Mind you, i must admit that i did laugh when i saw Coolios' hair.Damn funny.All in all this waste of space results in feelings of distaste,worry and overall nausea......but the DVD does make an excellent frisbee!"
1,Burn this movie for the sake of all mankind,This movie is the worst thing ever to be put on film. For the love of God...do not see this movie. I know that when there are so many bad reviews that one person out there is going to say...hmmmm...gee...maye I should see what they are all talking about! Really don't!!!! When I am 75 years old I will still remember the flashbacks of how I wasted 2 hours of my life seeing this movie. It will forever scar me how insulting this movie is to the general public. My IQ dropped 10 points becuase of this movie. My wife divorced me because I could not stop talking about how bad this movie is. I aquired a drug problem trying to stop the images in my head...so bland...so moronic...I remember the day when we saw this movie and both me and my friend simply sat there with our mouths wide open stared at how completely stupid this movie is. This movie and all copies of it must be banned and burned for the sake of all mankind.
1,This movie was a waste of my time!!!,"I love vampire movies especially Dracula films! I was a fan of the recent two Dracula's (Dracula 2000 and Dracula II) and when I saw Dracula 3000 at the video store I couldn't wait to see it!I thought the cover looked pretty cool especially with the modified H.R. Giger look, but I later found out it had nothing to do with this movie!Anyway, Dracula 3000 is not part of this series and is the worst low budget B movie I've ever seen! It truly was a waste of my time and I'm glad I didn't buy it as an addition to my Dracula collection!! The only good thing about the movie was that it was a free rental!I did find the true Dracula III: Legacy at the site listed below! There also is a trailer... It looks great!http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/film.php?id=531"
1,HORRIBLE - Don't waste you time,"Too bad I can't give negative stars. There are 80 min of my life that I will never get back. Where did they get that ""Dracula"" from, horrible actor. Coolio was hilarious though as a vampire on dope. But nothing scary about this movie or entertaining. And where is the ending??? It could have been a interesting story and I would like to see it with a better script."
5,"Poignant, heartwarming and informative all at once.","Probably the most informative and entertaining book I've ever read. This book had me crying, laughing and everything in between. A true story of our own struggle to discover ourselves through our closest living relatives. You can't have a more appropriate title than Next of Kin."
5,A mind and perception altering book,Fouts has written a book that will forever alter your view of mankind and consciousness ... it may be trite to say we are not alone ... but nonetheless true
5,"Heart-warming, enlightening and terrifying all at once!","This book is so enlightening.You will be stunned and amazed by Washoe, Dar, Tatu, Moja and Loulis (not to mention the plethera of other Chimpanzees not fortunate enough to end up in Ellensburg with Roger and Debbi Fouts).I found it difficult to believe how badly chimpanzees have been treated by humans - and what was even more shocking was that the further you read, and the nearer to modern day, things don't change. These social, thinking animals are still being experimented on and caged in windowless boxes.The book is also very heart warming though - and anyone who has read it will never see chimpanzees in the same way again. I am looking forward to the day I make a trip to Ellensburg to meet Washoe et al in person.Stunning, wonderful, adictive."
5,An Extraordinary Gift,"This book is an extraordinary gift. Extraordinary not because the book is moving (it is!), not because Dr. Fouts exquisitely chronicles Washoe's life (and the rest of her chimp family), but because the book drives home the closeness and the kinship we share with our chimpanzee cousins. With the exception of those completely devoid of compassion, you're almost certainly going to feel outrage, then sadness, at how inhumanely and cruelly we've treated chimpanzees over the years. This book should be required reading for everyone; you'll be all the more humble and compassionate because of it."
5,Most unexpected emotional rollercoaster since I was a teen!,"I started the book thinking that it would simply be a good read. Since I went to school at Central Washington University, I met the chimps and Roger several times. I did not expect to be introduced to Washoe as a mother, a sister, and a friend.Roger has tenderly portrayed Washoe and her family as more than five animated research chimps. He has created an emotional, psychological, and intellectual link between us and our ape cousins. He has introduced us to the next ""generation"" of people."
5,Truly enlightening,"At age 62, I still look for writers who will change and deepen my sense of our human nature and our place in the natural world. More than writers about religion per se, I think these writers are able to help us advance our moral and spiritual understanding and reconcile our human/animal natures. For some years I've been reading Goodall and others on primates, but Next of Kin was, for me, a pinnacle illumination. Even if you aren't interested in these types of questions, I think this book will move you deeply. If you ARE interested, may I also suggest the recent Mycelium Running by Paul Stamets.Take Me With You When You Go"
1,Very bad idea,"Nothing wrong with the music, but the whole idea of this CD is horrible. They play crickets chirping and other ""night-time"" noise all through the whole CD, and the Mozart music seems to be more in the background compared to the ""Mother Nature"" sounds. I want to hear the music, without it being masked by irritating noise. What's the point? Listened to the first 5 minutes, then packed it back in the case and stuck it in a box in the garage."
5,The Best!!,"If you've ever heard Roy Orbison sing, then this review is not needed. I've had all his recordings and though there are ones that are better than others, there is not a bad one in the bunch!! This CD is no exception. It has his greatest, most heart rendering selections plus a few 'feel good' tunes also.If you have never heard Roy Orbison sing, then you should have this album just for the sheer joy of hearing something you have never heard before and will never hear anywhere else again!"
3,Reruns of his original songs,"Love the artist. However, the songs selected to be played were NOT in my opinion their best renditions. If I had to do it over again, I would purchase the single song I wanted on the album, and tossed the others away."
4,We still miss him.,"I actually have this album as an import. It's a re-recording of his greatest hits but so like the origional, it's difficult to tell many years passed between the two versions. The likes of Rita Coolidge is singing backup on one of these tunes. Very well done. The sound is nice and crisp and his wonderful voice soars above all."
1,DONT BE FOOLED,"These re-recorded versions of Roy Orbison's classic early 60's hits pale in comparison to the originals. ""All Time Greatest Hits Vols. 1 and 2"" is a similarly priced collection featuring the original versions."
4,Quite amusing.,"Michaela Muntean, Do Not Open This Book! (Scholastic, 2006)A cute little book, this is, that not only gives youngsters a picture of the writing process (and some of its more cantankerous denizens), but also carries a subtext about the care with which a person should choose words-- a lesson which the next generation will be in dire need of learning, given how the generation above it seems completely incapable of same.Our protagonist here is a pig who's trying to write a book, but his audience keeps messing things up by turning the pages. It's possible that very young children may get bored-- this is very much a one-trick pony-- but the story is sufficiently short that that shouldn't happen. And there is a great deal for kids to think about here, and for parents to talk to kids about after they've had a chance to ponder. A fun book with which to explore options with your budding writer. ***"
1,This book is plain STUPID,"I really do not understand these rave reviews. The book looks like it was thrown together overnight. There was no thought put into the ""story"" and the illustrations are nothing spectacular. Only way to describe it is stupid. I returned it immediately and got something more exciting for my 5 year old."
5,A very FUN book!,"At the point that my daughter asked me to check out this book at the library for the 4th time, I knew it was time to buy it! A very fun read for preschoolers and one of my daughters favorites!!"
4,Opened many times,"My son received this book as a gift about a year ago and he's six now and still loves it. And then a few days ago, he surprised his mother by opening the book and proceeding to read it to her nearly word for word. He's in kindergarten so we had no idea his reading ability had reached this far. (We read to him nightly). Anyway, this book has achieved its own place in our family history."
5,I LOVED this book!,"Michaela Muntean is one of my favorite authors, and I have read a LOT of her work. Do Not Open This Book is excellent, and I think it thoroughly deserves 5 stars. The drawing and writing in this book are of fine quality and enjoyable to the reader. I laughed out loud at the silly illustrations for there are many hidden details. The author uses a clever trick to use the reader's name in the story that Pig writes. No matter how easy your name is, Pig says he can't spell it and makes the reader insert it into the story! It is the kind of book that you will want to read over and over again! I love the little bugs that follow Pig around and mimic his expressions! People of all ages are sure to love this book!"
3,Could be overstimulating,"I initially bought this bouncer based on all the positive reviews, plus I needed something to put my baby in for a few minutes. He liked it at first, but I think found the music and lights a but too much. I ended up buying the Ocean Wonders bouncer because he likes staring at things and he seems to be content watching the bubbles and the fish."
3,"Nice bouncer, but my child can't reach the toys!","This bouncer has some nice qualities. The vibrations are nice and will put your baby to sleep easily. It does need some head support though if you are putting a newborn in it. Also, my baby, who is 6 months now and average height and weight can still NOT reach the toy bar! They put it too far away. I know my child does not have short arms. I guess I wish I had bought a different one that had the toy bar closer to the child."
4,A safe place for my newborn,"My daughter was laying in this as soon as she came home from the hospital. It was a good place for daytime naps or for her to just sit in. As she grew, she began to enjoy the arch of toys, however I liked that they could come off if she wasn't in the mood. The best feature was the music playing whenever she kicked. She really got a kick out of that and caught on quickly. You definitely need to keep your baby belted in at all times. My daughter is now seven months old and really can't use it anymore because she tries to lean over and get out of it. But it was a lifesaver for the first 5 months of her life."
2,Don't Mess With a Good Thing...,"I borrowed this bouncer from a friend and LOVED it. My baby slept in it for the first 3 mo. It contoured her body and kept her flailing limbs still. During the day she loved the play bar attachment and I loved that it was more interactive than other bouncers I had seen.Eventually, the left kick pad wore out and I bought the new model Kick and Play to replace it. I love that the sound and lights respond to both kicks and batting of the hanging toys. HOWEVER, this new model is a lot more upright than the old one. My baby is 3 mo. old, but always ends up slumped toward the edge of the seat for a place to rest her head. It would be totally unsuitable for a newborn. I wish they still made the original Kick and Play. Unfortunately, this one is going back to the store :("
2,"Nice bouncer, but....","The manufacturer needs to list the minimum weight for use of the child. This bouncer is too upright for my newborn who is currently 6 weeks old. We recieved it when she was about 2 weeks old. My desicion to prefer this product was due to a great review written in reference to a newborn. It didn't work for our daughter, and we need something to entertain/calm her NOW!! We will exchange this bouncer for a different type that is not so upright."
2,Limited use - Not good for heavier/5 months+ infants,"I am the mother of 3 children (ages 3, 1 and 5 months) so I have tried many products and bouncy seats. This bouncy seat is being returned because it offers minimal support. My 5 month is only 15lbs and when she is in it, it lays back so far that she cannot even reach the toys. We have to put stuff behind her to help her sit alittle more upright.The toys and lights are great, but I would not recommend this item because once a child gets alittle bigger and heavier, the support will not be there so you would get limited use for this purchase."
4,Another good one for Fisher Price!,"We have had this kick and play since my daughter was born. She is now 8 months old. She still enjoys playing with it. She does not always want to sit in it now, but she will sit on the floor next to it and play. We used it plenty when she was an infant. This will say in our collection for the next child."
5,munchkin pleaser,"our little guy loves this bouncer. he loves making it light up and make sounds. i could do without the pattern and colors (i think most baby stuff is kind of ugly-but i guess they dig the colors) but the important thing is it's a fun, safe place for him to play, learn (cause and effect) and nap."
5,LIFESAVER!!! Buy This If Your Baby Has Colic!,"We got this as a baby shower gift. I didn't think we would be using it until the baby was a few months old..boy was I wrong!!!Our precious girl had a touch of colic and most nights, nothing else would do. We would turn on the vibration and bounce it a little and it would soothe her to sleep. She didn't care much for the music and lights at first, but that didn't matter, we just removed the toy bar. We use it everyday and she loves it! The friends that bought us ours are expecting and we are returning the favor by getting them one. I hope they enjoy it as much as we do!"
3,Kick & Play,"This is a great toy. The chair is a bit to upright, but it is very entertaining for infants."
3,Maybe mine is defective,"I had to get this bouncer online because it's discontinued. The seat is almost strait backed, there is no recline like in the picture, so the toy bar is right in her face. (Since the frame is all one piece I know it's not that I assemeled it incorrectlly) She will not stay for more then 2 minutes with the toy bar on, but because she loves to sit but can't sit up on her own yet, she will sit for 30 minutes or longer without the toy bar. This means that Mommy and Daddy can eat dinner together at dinner time instead of after bedtime."
1,Unsafe Product,"I had the original Kick & Play Bouncer and my son loved it. He is now 4 months old and we have used it since. Unfortunately, it got broke by my 2 year old nephew. I went out to get another and this was the one on the market. The seat on this one is propped up way too high. My son was sitting in this seat while I was doing laundry and he all of a sudden started screaming. I turned around and his whole body was hanging out of the seat parallel with the ground. The only thing holding him in was his leg.I called my niece who has a baby the same age as mine and who also has the same bouncy seat. She told me the same thing had just happened to her son a couple days before.I am calling Fisher-Price about this seat. It is unfortunate because my son loves the lights and toys but for safety reasons, he will not be using this seat again."
3,"A+ on Features, F on Durability","This item was received as a baby shower gift and by the time my son was 3 months old, the seat pad had started to fade. We had used the bouncer a total of two months and only washed it one time. I was very disappointed to see this product wear so quickly. My mom has a bouncer from Summer Infant that is excellent. Three boys and 10+ years later and her bouncer looks brand new!I called Fisher-Price this morning and they are willing to send a replacement pad. I will update this review at a later time to comment on the length of time it took to receive the replacement materials. Overall concept is wonderful, but durability was a disappointment.In addendum to the above, Fisher-Price wasted no time sending me the replacement pad. The replacement was delivered in a matter of days. Customer service was on the ball!"
1,Don't buy this item.,"I bought this bouncer for my twins. They both fell out of it!!! The seat sits up too far, so when they start to sit up on thier own they can just fall out of the side, even if you have the belt tightened all the way. I returned it the next day."
1,Not enough information.,"I recently purchased a car seat base, based on the picture on the web site. Babies R Us did not list what it was compatible with. When I received it, on the side of the box it listed the car seats it would fit. Thankfully it was right. Now I'm looking for an infant seat, (bouncer, walker, activity center) something my 3 month old granddaughter can sit in besides her car seat / carrier. None of the items list age or weight limits, different positions if applicable, dimensions or any other specifications. Very disappointing."
5,Well worth it,"Our daughter loved to sit in it and watch the lights and music play at about one month old. (With the constant play switched on)<br />At two months she figured out how to kick and make the lights go herself. She was rewarded by kicking her feet. I was worried it would be hard to make it work, but even the little kicks make it work. She had her first laugh in this bouncer.<br />She is now 4 1/2 months old and still loves to play in it and make the lights and sounds go.<br />I also love to put her in the bouncer without the toy bar on so she can sit where I can see her and talk to her better.<br />A must have."
4,great bouncer!,"my 3 week old son loves to sit in this bouncer and it's the one thing that doesn't make him look all slumped over and uncomfortable! He likes to watch the lights flash, but he's still a little too young to enjoy the kicking and bouncing part! But for now this bouncer is great for him to just relax and sleep in!"
5,Life Saver!,I would recommend this product to any baby from 1 month to 7 months old...my daughter is 6 months old and still uses it. This bouncer has saved me from plenty sleepless nights. My daughter absolutely loves it. My only regret is that she will be out-growing it soon!
3,Hanging toys just a tease on this otherwise good bouncy seat,"My daughter seemed to enjoy the bouncy seat when she was very young. It allowed her to view the world independently from an upright perspective. She also loved the vibration and the lights. The problem with the seat is that she could never reach the toys. In order to reach the toys she needs to be propped up. When propped up she has little support and often falls to the side, which means she cannot be left. She is also less comfortable and therefore will not stay in it for any length of time. The first time she was able to touch the toys (propped up) she was so excited. Those toys most have been teasing her, sitting there out of her reach. Therefore, this toy had limited use once she was interested in reaching and batting. By 5 mo. we were hardly using it any longer. It's too bad that FisherPrice has not fixed this flaw in their model."
3,Too loud!!!,I think the idea of a bouncer is to soothe a fussy baby when I have to cook dinner or care for twin sibling. I found the Kick and Play to be loud and overstimulating. I like the Aquarium bouncer much better--soothing lights and music do the trick!!
3,"Meh, it's alright.",My daughter has been using this bouncer since birth and for the most part likes it. She loves the vibe feature and we have it on constantly. I like that I can pick it up with her in it and move it around the house. The lights and stuff are okay but what really peeved me was that after two weeks the left foot kick pad broke. When she would kick it wouldn't work. So we don't even bother with that feature which is the PRIMARY selling point of the product. C'est la vie.
3,Ideas worth SIX stars; specific examples worth TWO,"The book was worth many times its price just for one chapter, ""Thinking Outside the Box,"" which contains many ideas that are simple yet incredibly creative (timelines, ""WANTED""-poster styles, blurbs, etc.)However, if family holidays, babies, and engagements have somehow eluded you, it is possible to feel VERY alienated from your own life by the traditional examples given. (In this case, please check out ""On Leaving a Trace"" for inspiration on writing and any of Lynne Perella's books for help with artistic expression.)I am just using this book to dip into for practical ideas (structures), of which it offers plenty. Then I quickly shut it and forget everthning else!"
3,Not sure yet...,"Makes OK espresso. One thing I'm worried about - it only heats enough hot water for about 1/2 an espresso cup before the ""OK"" light goes out. Is this normal, or did I get a dud machine? I haven't tried it with two cups yet, but I guess it'll just fill a quarter of each one. This doesn't seem right to me."
3,Not a general-purpose film for Yosemite,"This DVD stays at the similar style as Secret Yellowstone by NG. It is not for people who want to get an overview of this park. It is just focused on some special topics, climbing El Capitan, climbing Half Dome, global warming and the Giant Sequoia.The part of Climbing El Capitan is quite an eye-opener for me, especially the King Swing. It is beyond my original imagination. For people who never have an experience of rock climbing like me, it is very exciting to see this.The shooting quality is good as most films by NG. The animation is helpful to explain the science and geology.Overall, this film is suitable for people who want to know something not commonly seen in Yosemite."
5,Great book for industry professionals as well as investors,"This book is a must own for any financial services professional as well as any investor. Ben Baldwin takes the new investor through the basics of financial planning, teaches about mutual funds, life insurance, annuities in an easy to understand way pointing out the pros and cons of each product. Originally one of the fiercest detractors of variable products, Ben Baldwin was open minded enough to take a serious look and study variable products. His volte-face is as impressive as his credentials. To those who keep claiming that variable products are expensive, fee ridden products, maybe you should really open your mind and study these products. You might even change your mind and realize maybe is knows something you don't, that VUL might actually be the swiss army knife of financial planning."
4,the Key is know HOW to FUND it right,"Life ins. is a most preferred product for retirement if you know how to fund it right. Buy just enough ins. so it not MEC, and put as much as you can for cash value, and it needs time 20+ yr. to accumulate, not a short term.It offer liquidity, safety, Rate of Return, Tax favored, protection for peace of mine.Read Missed Fortune by Doughlas Andrew. so you will understand and think different about permanent life ins.Only about 20% of insurance agents know how to plan it right. The key is HOW TO FUND it right and it NEED TIME TO ACCUMULATE.so start as young as you can in the 20's not in the 50's with the right Agents, TIME IS YOUR GREATEST ASSETS."
4,Provides good background info,"The author does a good job of providing an overview of life insurance as an investment and savings tool. He is able to communicate the benefits of owning permanent life insurance as a supplement to your financial products. However, I disagree with his strong endorsement of the variable life insurance product.This product is one of the most complex products in the insurance industry. Its fees, costs and performance varies widely from company to company. Given the fact that you can simply borrow your permanent (whole life) insurance cash values and invest them yourself (without the sales loads) why pay twice? Overall a good read, especially for those who are not informed as to how to utilize their life insurance as a financial tool.Ivy League Wealth Secrets: That the Master Planners don't want you to know!"
2,"Not what I was expecting, too biased","If you're looking for an objective presentation of life insurance choices, this is NOT the book. This is biased towards Variable Univeral Life. I'm returning this book."
2,Decent,"Although Mr. Baldwin did a nice job explaining the various insurance products, he came across as too much of a salesman.I also found a portion of what he said to be misleading. He talks about how if a person is happy paying their premiums (and expenses) with after-tax dollars, then term insurance is good for them. He then states that by using a VUL product, a person can pay their fees with before-tax dollars. This is misleading in that the premium you pay to the insurance company IS AFTER TAX!The best thing to keep in mind while reading this book is that Ben Baldwin is an insurance salesman!"
2,Wears Out Quickly,All of the plastic Fresnel lens magnifiers have the problem of being very easy to scratch. Even stored in a soft plastic sleeve they will become unusable in a couple of months if you carry them in your pocket or in a wallet. They work fine when they're new. If you don't mind replacing them often they're useful.
4,Functional and Practical,"you never know when your going to need one, but for the price is a must in your wallet"
1,"Don't bother, no good","Don't bother, no good. Get yourself a real pocket magnifier. I found these 3 here on Amazon that worked well and still small for pocket. -Carson Optical Magniflip Compact 3 Power Magnifier-General Tools 532 2.5 Power Pocket Magnifier-SE Folding Magnifier 8X(8X a little too much for me)."
4,"Good, flexible lense","Simple, pliable, good magnification. Should have no problem starting a fire. A nice addition to my bag. Small enough to be there when you need it."
5,A good magnifier,"Compact & flexible. I ordered this along with a similar item with the Carson brand name; this is much better - the fresnel grooves on the Itoya are closer together, so this one is thinner, more flexible, and has better resolution."
3,Exercise Mat,"Great product, the mat cushion's you on the floor. One recommendation is that if you have animals this is not the mat for you. My two cats hair is sticking to the mat all the time."
2,Would not keep flat,This mat did not work for me in my pilates class. It was very slippery and has no traction plus it kept sliding around on the floor and would not roll flat. Maybe for a general exercise class but definitely not as a sticky mat.
4,Handiest non skid work mat,"Ironman Roll-Up Exercise Mat 24"" x 72""This mat is the most convenient I have ever used. It sets up very easy and stows in a small space. After un-rolling there is very little roll-back. The mat stays in place when in use -- even on a hardwood floor.I strongly recommend this product."
4,Snorlax book,My son loves pokemon and just starts reading and this book is perfect for beginner and the story is fun.
3,disappointed and offended,"i was interested in the book when i read about it. i have friends in wales, and i have visited them. so, i really thought the book would be More about wales. but, that was alright, the story was interesting and very boring. i have mixed feelings, mostly disappointed and bored with it, the author had a lot of problems using the american language. he misspelled alot and the punctuation was right in with it. i blame his editor for this. obviously, the editor is not an american. they cremated the book. now, i am also very offended by the way the author tore apart the catholic religion. he shouldn't have done that if you ask me. i was appalled. i always finish what i start, so i had to bear with it, it was so boring towards the middle and end. it was too much in detail about the island and way too long. i will not buy the other books."
4,A well-told saga,"I found this story compelling enough that I bought and read the rest of the series. I did particulrly like reading 20th century history from a Welsh point of view because it is slightly different from an American view. Some of the discordant notes in this novel and the whole series came from the author's unfamiliarity with American geography,law and word usage. Once I set aside the awkwardness of the language, it was a good read. The series as a whole improves once the setting shifts back to Great Britian."
5,Very enjoyable reading.,"I was surprised about how engrossed I got reading this saga of a Welsh coal mining family and their trials and tribulations both in Wales and here in America. The book is broken up into segment stories which are both captivating and often times intense. The author's way of presenting the history of this family brings us closer to the characters and the stories seem to come to life. This was indeed, an enjoyable read."
2,family saga,"The first half of this book was so good. About 1/2 way thru, it began to bog down. The story line seemed to change. I didn't finish it."
5,Great historical novel,A very good read. I am partial to historical novels and this is one of the really good ones. Cannot believe I got in on the free download to my iPad Kindle app.If this is a new author I hope she makes this a series or at the very least continues on this line.
2,A Million Tears,"Another book I did not like. The characters did not draw you into the story, they had no depth, and it seems the author was writing it just to make the money."
4,A million tears,"I loved the first book in the ""tears"" series. However I really got bogged down in the second book, struggling through it now."
3,Easy reading,I found this book refreshing and fast to read. I did not like the way it ended. There was too large a gap of time.
3,A bit disappointed.,"After reading ""A Million Tears"", I doubt I will read the others in the series. It's not badly written (although the author does seem to have a bit of trouble with the comma and semi-colon---often just left out entirely). However, what has the potential to be a really good family saga needs some polishing. Parts of the story were very interesting, in spite of the rather pedantic story-telling style, but then the next few parts would drag, drag, drag. Once I forced myself through the draggy parts, I enjoyed the rest. It did not grab me enough to make me want to continue reading the future volumes, however.I'm sorry I couldn't give it more stars. A project this ambitious is a lot of work to write. But the language needs to be sharper and the characters more three-dimensional. It needs a rewrite."
1,"As realistic as Law and Order, CSI, and Crossing Jordan.","Well, all I have to ask is ""What color is the sky in YOUR world Mr. Feige?? Or maybe someone should send the author a map to find the Bronx because the junk that he wrote must be about some other jurisdiction. Of all places for a Defense attorney to practice law-the Bronx is the most ""defendant friendly"" in terms of its jurors and judges. Juror mistrust of the police, which attorneys capitalize on, contributes to the abismally low conviction rate. A defense attorney merely needs to show up basically. Of course anyone that knows Mr. Feige also knows that he, along with his other Bronx Defenders, have trouble actually showing up to court and handling their cases.Save your money folks-if you still want to read this ""Fiction"" (fantasy is more like it) wait for it to hit the closeout stores when they'll be unloading copies for a buck or two."
1,Not very good!,David Feige and Indefensible are similar to Jason Blair and The New York Times. Pure fantasy and no credibility. The book is poorly written and is not very interesting. I don't see what all the concern is about. Nobody will read this trash anyway.
5,"Great book, but an one important point...","This is the type of book I really enjoy: a work of non-fiction that reads like fiction. The book kept your interest throughout, although some of the flashbacks (it really wasn't a ""single day"" as implied, but was a series of stories that culminated over time into a single day) got a bit lengthy.However, I need to make an important point with respect to the previous reviewer who commented that the author resembles Nick ""Tortellini"", Carla's ex-husband from the T.V. show ""Cheers"". This is absolutely not true! The author is actually a dead ringer for Nick ""Tortelli"" , Carla's ex-husband on the T.V. show Cheers. Just look at the author's picture on the dust jacket, and the picture of Nick on Wikipedia (just search ""Nick Tortelli"" on Wikipedia)."
5,Amazing... Couldn't Put it Down!,"Indefensible is a brilliantly written page turner filled with heartbreaking and disturbing stories. Mr. Feige bravely takes on the Bronx justice system, and clearly (see some of the vengeful reviews on this site) and intentionally has ruffled some feathers. Mr. Feige's deep self-reflection, dedication, passion and wisdom are admirable. I would highly recommend this book."
1,Welcome back from Fantasy island,I know this guy from the Bronx Courthouse. He couldn't handle a traffic ticket let alone a homocide case. Four murder cases in one day? Pure fantasy. The author isn't fit to shine Brenner's shoes!
1,Bullshi*,The author is an absolute idiot. He has never tried a homicide case in his life. I dont appreciate attacking another person behind his back and in print. If he were a real man he would make his backhanded comments face to face. A weak book by a weak willed man.
1,Biased and a waste of money,This book comletely lacks ANY objectivity and is therefore a waste of time. What's particulary disapointing is that the author missed a valuable chance to write a balanced analysis of the crimianl justice system. Shame on him.
5,I loved it,"I read this book straight through, practically without putting it down. It was that compelling. It is funny and heartbreaking, too. The author obviously has enemies, who account for all these negative reviews, but if you are a regular person without an agenda, who can appreciate anger at injustice and compassion for the poor, you will probably understand what the author is talking about. Plus, all those enemies make the book really interesting - he names them. Pretty good stuff!"
5,Illustrates problems with American justice system,this book gives the audience an in-depth view into the American justice system and the flaws within. the book was extremely easy to understand and was extremely beneficial to read as well as gain knowledge that someone outside the legal field would rather never realize. great book.
2,Unreliable,"I think that most reasonable people would agree that there are serious problems with the criminal justice system, especially with regards to the difference in its treatment of the rich and of the poor. I was excited to read this book because I hoped that someone with Mr. Feige's experience would have intelligent things to say about how to make the system better. The problem is that Mr. Feige is so biased that it is impossible to rely upon his judgment. Mr. Feige says with regards to ADAs, ""I despise them and what they stand for"" (195). He seems to believe that almost none of his clients belong in jail. He describes almost all of the judges he encountered in terms that made them seem entirely unreasonable. The result is that when Mr. Feige implies, for example, that a substantial fraction of all DV cases brought in the Bronx are spurious, you don't really know whether to believe him or not. It might actually be true, but given Mr. Feige's slant, you can't really know."
5,"Amazing, Inspirational - A Must-Read for any Would-Be Critic of the Legal System...","After buying and reading about 100 books on Amazon as a pre 1L, and having read almost every ""this is what it's like to be a lawyer"" book out there ... I was finally inspired to take a moment to write a review of this book.It is truly amazing, inspirational and well crafted.And like the previous reviewer, I too am also here to buy several more copies to share with friends and family. This book can be appreciated by anyone, not merely those who are glad to finally see the injustices of the so-called justice system put into words.This book is a feat of creativity, courage and passion.I urge you to buy and read this book. You will not regret it."
4,U581 Scanner,"After a slight mix up with the delivery, I recieved my U581 as promised.The unit worked great except for certain GM codes that were not available. The code was there, but the explanation of it was not available.I thought it might be that I did not make sure to """"Update"" the unit (sometimes the item arrives and there are new updates already that need to be installed).So I read the skimpy manual that came with it, hooked up the antiquated Serial Cable to my computer (they need to include a USB Cable and Software Drivers), went on the website and tried to download the update...it Didn't work.I have tried the unit on about 6 cars in the past week and the only one that I had trouble with was a 96 Buick. It even worked good when used on a 2001 Volkswagen."
5,U581 scanner,I have had my scanner for well over a year now and it gets used alot. No problems so far it has been working great.
4,Very good code scanner,This code scanner paid for itself the first time I had to use it to diagnose and replace a bad coil in my wife's Saab. I have since used it many times on my family and friends cars. I tend to leave this in my automotive emergency bag so it stays in the car in the hot summer months. The screen protector warped and came off because of the heat but I realize that it is my own fault. But the lack of protector doesn't affect functionality. It's a nice product for the price.
2,U581 CAN OBDII Memo Scanner,I tried to update device and prompt comunication failure can anybody help me...I do this with 3 direfents PCs
1,sucked,"this book was horrrible i skipped a whole lot in this book cause it bored me so much .this book just sucked,it was in the banned/challenged section at my libriary and i dont understand whats wrong with this book besides its boring."
5,Great Fun,Mackler weaves a creative and humorous tale that will resonate with teenagers and remind adults of who we once were. Throughly enjoyable!
4,Vegan Virgin Valentine,The book was good. The plot itself was good. The only thing it really lacked was shock value. Nothing was suprising. But the whole thing with the girl having a neice a year youger then her is crazy! if you like the a-list or gossip girl books you might like this book
1,Vegan Virgin Valentine,"Parents beware! This book contains an overusage of the ""f"" word, graphically-described sexual encounters with the boss/boyfriend (detailing the undressing, body part descriptions, hip grinding, etc.), and in the end the ""good"" girl loses her virginity and shows up for graduation in a tank top that says ""can't say no"" without a bra on. This is a heroine??? This is coming of age??? This is our goal for our teen girls??? This is young ADULT reading (18 or over) and in my opinion is NOT appropriate for minors."
1,Translation... My god.,"Having read a good dozen of Natsume Soseki's books, I can assure you that not liking this one based purely off Soseki's merit isn't possible. Every book I've read by the author so far has left me in awe, and so when I ordered the Three-Cornered World I expected yet another amazing Soseki read. How disappointing. I thoroughly believe my hatred for this book stems from the translator and not Natsume Soseki. I really wasn't impressed by Alan Turney. He was redundant and made overall interesting topics into long-winded, arbitrary ones. He's just not a good writer. And so I have to sadly give this book a 1. Giving up on page 97, I really just couldn't take it anymore. I wouldn't recommend getting this copy of the book. If there are any other translations out there, I urge you to try and obtain one of those instead."
5,A Michigan we remember,"The author is obviously a lover of the movie theatre of days past. Will we see their like again? Like him, I grew up in Michigan when these theatres (like him, I'll use the spelling used in their heyday) were still around. Fortunately, some few still are."
2,The author of this work didn't always do proper research.,"Found inaccuracies and speculation. One item in particularly, concerning Donald Harry Fearn just mimicked early newspaper speculation with NO follow up..Many misleading statements.To say his journalism was suspect would be kind."
1,"Not good for wii, nintendo",beware of good reviews on this as they come from people who give glowing reviews of this vendor's products (eforce city) and this vendor only. this is a sign of dishonest shilling.prodcut does not reach screws. tip is not standard trikey and very cheap.there are half a dozen different tri wings that work better for same money from other better vendors around on amazon.
3,Dirt cheap works good,"Very cheap, cheaply made, but gets the job done. always good to have laying around. took my motorola razr v3c apart with these."
1,Be Careful of Prices that Seem Too Good Too Be True,"This product is NOT what was advertised. It does have many useful security bits if you run into those from time to time. The one that most will probably be buying this set for is the tri-wing bit to open Nintendo products and cell phones. This was NOT included in the set. As dissappointing as this was when I received it in the mail, it's hard to complain when I paid about 90 cents for it. Still - this product is not as advertised and that's not okay."
3,Magnet Issues,The Screwdriver had a very weak glue holding in the magnet so I ended up using superglue to hold the magnet in place. The bits were fine but are small so can't be used in other holders.
4,"works for wii, sorta","to those getting this to open the wii, u should now that its not long enough to reach two screws on the case. easy fix though, i put some toilet paper as a spacer between the driver and the bit, worked great."
1,You get what you pay for,"I got this set as an add on for one cent. Its not worth the effort to return it for my penny back. Only two of the bits actually fit in the handle. I dont recomend this set for the tools, but if you need a cheap plastic folding case for a penny, its great."
3,mignetic,its magnic witch is cool wish the bits were a little bit longer but work for what you need. very simple
2,All but the tri-wing,"I bought this to open my Wii.Unfortunately all the bits were there, except the tri-wing. Somebody swapped the tri-wing with another useless bit."
1,Don't waste your time,"If it looks too good to be true, it is. This product is clearly made with the cheapest of materials and it just barely does it's job. At first I thought there was no magnet on the thing, but it turned that there is a extremely weak magnet in there that does virtually nothing. After a while, the bits wouldn't even stay secure inside the screwdriver. Not to mention that the bits and screwdriver came with tons of rust on it. I got this product for the Tri-Wing bit. So how did the Tri-Wing bit work? I never found it, there were the 15 bits, but none of them were Tri-Wing. Bottom line, don't waste your time. Spend the extra dollars for a quality product."
4,Worked for me!,"Great little set of tools, needed it for the tri-wing screwdriver, and at first I couldnt find the right bit, but it was there, I just kept checking each one. worked like a charm!"
2,Falsely advertised,This screwdriver set was advertised as including a tri-wing screwdriver. We needed one for a very important project. The set came but did not contain a tri-wing screwdriver. Enough said.
2,"Cheap set, low quality","The set does offer a variety of screwdrivers and tools. I was able to use it- but the drivers themselves were easily stripped and unusable. If you get this issue and still want to get a job done, try using a metal file to shorten the driver to the part that is not yet stripped.If you want a reliable set try to find another one on Amazon with better reviews. It will be a waste of your time and money to buy something like this. It is from Hong Kong which is not necessarily bad but in particular I am not very happy with this set."
4,Used it to open up Macbook Pro 13' (and my dell inspirion 1545),"This is a good, affordable tool to use for opening up your laptop in order to replace the harddrive. Personally, I used it to take out the screws from the bottom of my macbook pro 13', and replace the 160GB harddrive with a 7200rpm 320GB harddrive, and also I replaced the 2GB default ram with 4GB ram.I'm pretty happy right now :)."
4,Worked great for Wii,"I got this for the Wii, it worked great. Seems cheap, from china, but did the job! I only used it for the one bit."
2,Cheap... You get what you paid for,Well this tool set seemed like a good idea and for the most part it's done its job.I needed the T5 in order to take apart my Sony Ericsson phone and this kit was as expensive as a single T5 screw driver so I pulled the trigger.After using it to disassemble the phone i noticed that the bit had started to wear off at the corners making it more difficult to un-tighten the bolts. Poor materials use.These days i use the magnetized tips as a way to collect the bolts after I used a different screw driver to un-tighten them.
5,Wonderful Book,"I just finished library school and used this book as the primary reference for my final project on ""The Dao of Crisis Communications."" This is a very comprehensive, useful, and easy-to-understand reference book. I read at least 40 articles and four other crisis communications-related books to research my topic, but this was the best in terms of addressing crisis planning in a library setting. I found no other book like it. I highly recommend."
1,Terrible!,"This product is about worthless for short hair dogs. I did a better job just running my fingers along my dogs coat!My dog hated it as well, and he loves being brushed."
2,Same as comb,"Doesn't work any better than a comb. Don't know what I expected, but it was a waste of money. Teeth very close together. Hard to get hair to go through comb."
1,Absolutely useless tool,We have a short haired dog and found this tool to be absolutely useless. The dog sheds profusely but the ShedEnder Pro collected almost zero hair.
2,Not what I had expected,"I subscribe to a blog from a lady who writes about Boston Terriers. She raved about this Shed Ender and how amazing it was. Well, it definitely lifted some pet dander, but not much hair. It might be good for different breeds, but I wouldn't recommend it for Boston Terriers."
2,furminator the more efficient tool,"i got this for my cat (ocicat breed). he's a short-haired cat that doesn't generally need much grooming except when the season changes. shedender worked just like the commericals. one brush and fur goes flying everywhere. it does remove hair however the teeth of the comb are not deep so the removed hair goes either flying or stays on top of the fur towards the back. as u can see in the picture the tool is small. if you have the patience and extra time (and if your pet has the patience too!) u can think about saving some money with this tool. if you want something more efficient, invest some extra money and go for the furminator instead. i bought both and compared them but i'm keeping my furminator despite the much higher price."
1,Do not like this product,It doesnt work on my little dog. He has short hair and it takes forever to get a tiny bit of hair off of him
3,ehh,My mom bought this when she came across it at the store since my cat was starting to shed.Its ok....The whole thing is pretty sturdy. The blue part of the handle is a hard plastic and the grey is a really thick rubber so its easy to grip and won't slip from your hand. The thing is that its hard to brush my cat with this due to where the handle is located...makes it hard to maneuver.Also to me the teeth of the comb seem to small...doesn't take out much hair and I feel like I'm pulling my cats fur when I actually manage to get a bit out..(for the record I have a medium haired cat.)I'd try your luck somewhere else.
1,Trash,"This product was a waste the product overview made it sound like the best thing ever, but after the delayed delivery I tried it out and it didn't work at all! Waste of money!!! Don't buy!!!!!"
5,Former Cynic,"I rarely believe advertisements. Usually people will say anything to sell their product. My cat was shedding horrifically and I went to a pet store to look at these de-shedding tools. If this puppy did not work I was not about to pay 20-39 dollars for the thing. I got curious and came on to Amazon to check it out and see if I could get it cheaper. Much to my surprise, I did and with what I had to pay, was not allot to lose if it didn't work. I have to admit, I am no longer cynical about this tool. It works like a charm and I couldn't be more pleased.I am really glad I have it now. It definitely makes a difference. My cat likes to be brushed but really doesn't like this tool. It is not soft enough for him but he tolerates it and I love it!"
2,For short hair only,This items works on my cat with short hair. This items does not work on my pomeranian or my cat with longer hair. I would recommend only for animals with short hair.
1,doesn't work.,I have a pug and bought this in hopes of helping with his shedding problem. For anyone who doesn't know pugs shed A LOT! I could brush him for hours and still be pulling loose hair off of him so I was hoping for a product that might help. This product was completely useless. It didn't pull off any lose hair and he hated it more then the brush. I gave it a couple tries before I just gave up and went back to the usual brush. I don't know if it would work better on dogs with thicker coats but it was completely useless on my pug.
4,Works pretty well...,"I have 2 cats and both have different types of fur..on the thicker fur it works very well, especially on the under coat...but on the slick type fur..it doesn't gather much. Be very careful on the belly and such because the comb is somewhat sharp."
4,best so far,"I bought the shed ender on ebay and tried it out for the first time this weekend. I have a pug and he sheds a lot. I haven't been able to find a brush that has worked - I have tried wire brushes, ones made for short hair dogs, plastic brushes, and nothing collects more than a few strands of hair.As I said, I tried the shed ender this weekend and this has been the best brush so far. I thought I might be hurting him because there was the brush seemed to have a little resistance while I was brushing him, but he didn't seem to mind. There was so much hair coming out I couldn't believe it! It is hard to use on the legs and sides, but with that much hair coming out off of his back, I really can't complain. This brush is amazing!It takes a few tries to get it at the right angle to brush, but I would definitely recommend it. Also, my pug will lay down on my lap and chew on toys while I do it, so this brush may not work for dogs who like to move around a lot."
5,Best at combing cat hairs,I have used this shed ender on my cat and it gets tons of under hairs out. Can't beleive the difference from this product and the other combs and brushes I have used in the past. I highly recommended the shed ender. In fact my cat loves it also.
4,Shed Ender,"I like this, and so do my cats. It's very comfortable and easy to use. The only drawback that I find is the hair never seems to end!! I can use it over and over and over in one sitting and am still pulling off tons of undercoat. And, that, it is harder to use on the sides of the cats body because you don't have anything to kind of push the brush into except their belly which is, of course, soft. I do like this product because my cat has stopped having so many hairballs and that is the best plus!!"
5,Works for our Persian.,"The ShedEnder has a lot of mixed reviews, but for the price I took a chance. It works great for me. I had no trouble at all using it. The first time I used it I got a mound of hair off of our Persian cat. I have not tried any other brands, so I cannot say which is better, but I am very pleased with my purchase. For the price, I don't really think you can go wrong with this."
1,Commercial is total bull.,"I have a hefty tortoise-shell Manx who is constantly shedding. I saw the commercial for this product, and the gobs of hair it removed from the animals, and just had to have one. Boy, was I ever disappointed! When I try to brush my cat with it, the teeth just float on top of her hair... they don't even go down into the undercoat. Maybe it's because she's chubby, I don't know, but it sure doesn't work for her. I'm left handed, so I had to turn the blade the other way on the handle. Maybe I'm not using it right. I'm still very disappointed. The animals they show on television must have not been brushed in years for them to get that amount of fur off of them."
1,Like FURminator better,I tried the shed ender on my yellow lab (who loves being brushed). She hated it. It seemed to pull hair out by the roots not remove loose hair and it hurt. Her skin would twitch and she would jump each time that happened. I tried the FURminator and it is much easier to use and it got a lot of hair and she liked it. It also worked very nicely on my sheltie.
2,Furminator instead,"The way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use. I would get the Furminator instead, it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes! This technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove."
2,"Does what it claims, but takes forever","This product does what it claims. I recieved it a few days ago and it has performed well. The downside of the product is the size. It does a good job if you have an hour or more (depending on the size of your pet) to spend using it. They tout it's price in comparison to other models costing around forty dollars or more. I wish I had invested in the bigger, more expensive FURminator. I rate this product with two stars, only because it's a hassle and time consuming to use on a larger animal. It would probably be worth it if you own a small dog or cat."
2,one month blade became dull!!!,it worked well the shed ender pro for one month.lab 75 pounds and 40 pound short haired terrier.blade became dull!company replaced the blade free of charge.impossible to reinsert!!unable to reach the company.on hold long time!!!furminator a much better product and cost wise.35$ on amazon.free shipping!!!paid 14$ for shed ender and worked for one month???probably best on cats and very shorthaired small dogs!!
1,Shedender No way...,The teeth on the shedender are to small. I used it on my cat and it really didn't do much.
2,I'm disappointed!,"This steam mop does a great job cleaning, however, the down side outweighs the good points. The handle is not sturdy, and came off a few times while using it. The cloth that came with the mop was flimsy and came apart after using it one time (I used an old towel the second time I used it), but it was difficult to tighten any cloth to the mop. Once the cloth got wet it became looser which made it hard to mop the floor. Needless to say, after 2 tries, I sent it back."
1,The mop you cannot wring out,"Take a dishtowel put hot water on it and strap it to a block at the end of the broom handle. Push it around your floor. Once it gets dirty, keep pushing it around your floor. This is a high priced Swifter and does not clean as well as one. This product is a joke."
1,Better off with a mop and bucket!,"It's the concept that's wonderful ... not the product. It just spreads around the dirt more than anything. At least you can rinse a mop out, with this you have only ONE cloth to work with. Which means laundry, and you can't use it without the cloth. I STILL had to waddle around with a towel on my feet to dry the floor. My grout had mud crammed into it half way through the job (Pets & kids = high traffic and dirty floors!), which only discolored it more. I had to go over it with my mop anyway! It's compact and fits well in a closet but is bulkier than a mop when it's out ""drying"" ... I can put my mop outside, I couldn't with this. It does what it promises ... it's an electric mop ... but modern conveniences aren't always so convenient. Don't waste your money or time, avoid the stubbed toes and UPS shipping fees!"
1,product needs more research!,Used the mop once. The pad tore into shreds after cleaning three small ceramic tile floors. At [price] per pad this is NOT acceptable product performance. Returned item.
5,As Expected,"This Tanita home scale with body composition capablity works as expected. After purchase I took it to a facility that has a commercial body composition test device, also manufactured by Tanita, to compare the results. The results were essentially identical. I do not get a print-out with this device that is available with the commercial device, but the weight and percent body fat were the same.Excellent!"
1,Ignore The Gail Cooke Review!!!,"The Tanita InnerScan BC550 is a decent scale, it measures weight, fat%, body water, and bone mass.IT IS NOT THE SCALE REVIEWED BY GAIL COOKE---hers is a higher level model with additional features--muscle mass, visceral fat, fat% memory, weight memory and other measurements. I ordered this based on her review and now have to pay to return it. Hopefully, the company will take it back.BUYER BEWARE---YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE REVIEWED SCALE"
3,Weaving the Literacy Web,"The book gives you a great idea of how to start your own literacy web for your own book choices. I think the concept is wonderful and I whole-heartedly support using children's books as a focal point for cross-curricular webbing. However, I was disappointed by the lack of examples in this book. As a teacher, I'm always hoping for concrete, usable ideas that I can put into play in my classroom right away. I think it's important to ""share the wealth"" with one another and I felt a bit gipped here. I'd love to see her produce a book with more complete samples and lesson ideas. Otherwise, a great beginning resource and advocate of early childhood literacy."
2,The book was not what I expected!,"I was disappointed in this book.I expected the author to give curriculum based ideas for specific books, for example ""Chica Chica Boom Boom""!Instead it was curriculum based ideas for any book that you choose.I can do that myself without purchasing the book!"
5,Great book on the foundations of relativity,"The reference to ""A."" which Mr. Ecce Nihil could not find is to a German book by Reichenbach, as written in the author's introduction at page xv. Reichenbach's book IS consistent. It is one of the few books on relativity explaining the question of clock synchronization properly and comprehensively ( in the sense of Bridgman's operational view )."
3,"Fun loving,skinny dippin hippies, 2 nudist party crashing rednecks with guns and 1 guy in a 25 dollar halloween costume.","When I bought this one I knew what I was getting. When I watched the first five minutes my thoughts were correct and I was satisfied. The soundtrack is hillarious the acting is bad , some of the audio was absolutley atrocious in a few sequences and the picture a bit orange(worth a purchase as long as you don't pay much).I could have rated this five stars but I swear there's scenes missing.Most likely from lost or damaged reels. I can't imagine they would have cut parts out as it seems relevant to the script or lack there of. Some characters just dissapear with out a trace, never to be seen again.Questions go unanswered(as if u could care) without explaination. Anyway it just makes the storyline or drug hazed banter even funnier. The dream sequence of one of the girls was down right funny as s##t."
1,Usuchi Digard's Bigfoot,"The movie starts with a mysteriously strange narrator, who never materializes again in the movie, who sits concealed by bushes, squatting with binoculars, and declares to us; ""The story we are about to see, is VERY real.""Ah, I guess some things never change.I'm forced to check out the movie and seek immediate medical attention, putting my Bigfoot activities on hold until I complete a course in powerful antibiotics. Bigfoot abducts naked women and keeps them captive in a Bigfoot cave. A pointless Bigfoot movie. A pointless movie."
3,update of beauties and the beast,"I found it to be most interesting altogether the yeti makes off with 4 women taking the first three back to his lair with one escaping, then he finds another girl with her boyfriend having a picnic with there clothes off, the monster abducts her also and plays around with her for a bit while she is unconscious. all together i thought this was a decent movie. some scenes are ridiculious but over all i would not hesitate to reccomend this movie to someone else."
4,Good as a introduction book.,"This book is very good for introduction in ad-hoc networks and protocols. It also can be used for quick start in this field.Another good thing for this book, it is very useful when you write your research paper or thesis because the author already summalized concepts and pros/cons of many ad-hoc network protocols. However, if you need to know and learn in deep detail, do not buy it. The author should insert ""Introduction"" in the title of this book. Furthermore, the price of this book is too expensive that it should be."
4,Good use for defense work,I have been using this book for parts of my defencework. It has provided me the content I needed andclear enough for me to understand. We were lookingfor performance numbers and this book provided uswith the number we wanted from a working system.Good coverage on issues overall.
1,A biased book,"This is the second (expensive) book I bought that is authored by CK Toh. I am disappointed once again. The book is nice in a sense that it's the first to cover ad hoc networks in general, not just routing. However, I find this book extremely biased. The author could have maintained objectivity in deciding what to cover in this book, and how they are described. He spends too much space explaining his own protocols (unfortunately, they are not well recognized in the research area) while fails to give in-depth study of other important protocols. Clearly disappointing."
1,Not a book to have,Luckily I had an ability to read this book before buying. I was very dissapointed with the content. There are quite a number of serious errors especially in TCP description. The coverage lacks depth. The new methodology proposed by the author in his unicast routing algorithm is just another kind of metrics with the same good old SPF idea behind (the description of the idea makes good 1/3 of the book).I would not recommend it to anyone.
2,lack depth in all subjects,"performance data are collected in a purely fixed wireless environment, lacking the most important part of mobility. it is very disappointing to read the whole book written by a PhD holder. the book introduces elementary concepts about everything. in essence, it tells nothing"
3,Book Text,The text in the night pages is black on dark blue which is difficult to read and make an otherwise good book difficult to use with a night light.
5,Provocative&Timely,"I came across Brittany's book in a local bookstore not too long ago. I ended up reading it in two sittings. The book is full of helpful advice for most situations that any teen has faced, and will continue to face. These aren't always the easy answers, but that doesn't seem to frighten this young and very able author. BUY IT. GIVE IT TO YOUR HURTING FRIEND."
2,Not so gentle eye makeup remover,"Although this eye makeup remover is described as gentle with camomille, after using it every night for awhile now, it has dried my eyelids and caused them to be red and puffy. I guess I need to find a truly gentle remover for eyes."
4,A fancy little thing...,"This is a cool and innovative idea, releasing a music single on DVD so that it can also include the video. The video for Hidden Place is interesting. At first glance it just seems like strange images in a repeating pattern, which it is. But it definitely grows on you through repeated viewings. It shows why Bjork continues to be an artist who creates groundbreaking videos with directors who wish to push the medium in order to attain its fullest potential.The two bonus songs are very good too, although the negative is that these songs can only be listened to on your DVD player and not in a traditional CD player, not quite the ideal place for most people. However, this is only a minor gripe and shouldn't deter those who wish to buy this item."
2,"Love the song, Hate the Video","Bjork's videos have always been fresh and interesting, somewhat weird but always interesting. I proudly own Volumen and watch it frequently. But alas, Hidden Place is not very good. This video has no style, it is goo traveling around a woman's face. It starts with a wide shot of a presumably naked Bjork, then zooms in to her hair, then down to her face, then I am stuck watching goo come from her eye, up her nose, in her mouth, in her eye again, all in this cycle for 3 minutes. Now, this is either a joke, or somebody was lazy and couldn't think of anything else. Don't tell me the song fits the video, it doesn't. Anyway, I give it 2 stars because of the other songs and the badass duck that sits on-screen when they are played, because when you think about it, the video is just about the same damn thing."
3,"Adequate for indoor grilling, not worth the price","I received this grill as a gift last year and was rather excited about it; I liked the idea of being able to ""grill"" indoors when the weather was bad. I also liked the concept of the ""infusion cup"" under the grill surface. I was surprised to see how much it cost, though.After my first use, I was less impressed with the product. While it does a good job at ""grilling"", it does not seem to justify the rather steep price tag, especially when products like the George Foreman grill, which I also own (and happen to believe is also overpriced), cook foods quicker and more evenly on both sides. The ""infusion cup"" is more of a gimmick than anything else. I didn't notice any enhanced flavor from the fresh herbs I put in the cup. Overall, it IS a good product, but there are probably other brands available that work just as well for a lower price."
4,"Good Grill, A bit hard to clean","I got this grill for my boyfriend who loves to grill and we live in the city. It does do grill marks for the foods, just let the grill heat up first. Also it is a bit expensive, but I got it for half the price. I don't think it is worth [money]. The grill is a bit hard to clean, but since it is non stick, it comes off easily but hard to get in between the grill. Still trying to find a good brush to get into those crevices. Also the grill is a bit big for my sink, but if I am careful, it does not splash as much. The little cup is a nice feature, whenever we remember to use it."
3,Fascinating but flawed study of progressive rock.,"I found this book enjoyable and infuriating at the same time. Martin's take on prog rock is well informed and thorough. But I kept wanting to argue with him all the time I was reading it.My main problem with the book is that Martin has specifically modified his definition of progressive rock to exclude Frank Zappa. His definition also excludes Pink Floyd, while admitting the Mahavishnu Orchestra. This strikes me as ducking the issue; if Martin were to consider the work of Zappa along side Yes, King Crimson, etc., he would probably have to modify his thesis, and would probably has produced a stronger book.Nevertheless, I am quite glad I bought this. But my copy will be severely marked up!!!"
3,the book argues that punk rock appeared as a new wave music.,"THE BOOK's IDEA OF PUNK ROCK Bill martin's argument is that punk rock appeared as a new wave of music. He completely shatters the myth of it being a type of music against progressive rock by stating that it was a great part of the rock era. The line, ""By the mideighties, punk was either a 'hard-core' taste for a few people with leather jackets,and mohawks or it had merged into a larger new wave scene"" is an example of biased word choise. This is not historically accurate. This resource, however, is scholarly because of the many noted historians in its bibliography. It also goes into a hardcore generation and bands that have shaped punk music. It does not recognize punk rock as an entirely new music, but views it as one large part of progressive rock history. The historical question being persued is what has punk rock provided for progressive rock? This is answered and then the book moves on to other music genres."
1,it takes 150 pages out of 300 before anything significant,"is said about the subject, one is thankful that one doesn't have to sit thru the lectures of this ""academic"".more is said about how ""Prog Rock"" fits into the author's version of Marxist philosophy than is said about the _music_ or the bands and individuals who made it."
2,Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons would be proud,"This book is simply a train wreck in its approach to discussing evrything under the sun. The author has a keen understanding of rock's evolution, but his writing is a shambles. Alternating between indescribable academic Marxist philosophy one minute, to anecdotal mentions of gathering 'round the piano with fellow nerds to knock out a few chords of ""Siberean Khatru"" - it can be a real slog. The one argument Martin has that he fully develops is that ""Yes is the greatest band ever because I say so"". It gets pretty amateurish.There also an annoying habit of quoting Bill Bruford and Robert Fripp and informing the reader that their views on progressive rock are simply ""misinformed"". A much wiser choice is Paul Stump's excellent ""The Music's all that Matters"" which is full of lucid writing placed into a coherent whole. Stump's book will appeal to any music fan - highly recommended."
3,not quite what I expected,"The knob didn't quite fit they way I hoped. Even tightening it as best I could, it wobbled a little. I probably didn't select the right knob for my car.I should add that the is quite narrow and not very comfortable in your hand. The quality was satisfactory, however."
4,Terrific heat retention!,"This is a great vacuum flask for the price. It keeps beverages warm for ages. I can go out to run errands for a couple of hours, come back and enjoy a steaming mug of coffee. I've had it a few months and nothing on it has broken -- it's robust.The only minor downside is that, yes, it does leak a little out of the base somehow. This doesn't seem to affect the heat retention, but it leaves little coffee drips on the counter. That doesn't bother me as I have to wipe the counter down after grinding beans and plunging the coffee anyway. You get what you pay for and this does a perfectly adequate job for the price. I'm happy!"
3,"Leaky Bottom, Now Fixed. Now works just fine.","As I read in another review, the bottom of this carafe started leaking immediately. The glass tube itself isn't leaking so the only source I could find is between the top of the glass tube and the carafe. On the other hand, what coffee it didn't leak was kept hot for at least three hours. I'm going to try to fix the problem and report back.Update: I unscrewed the bottom of the carafe and wiggled the glass tube into place. Coffee stays hot a long time (at least 5 hours)."
3,A Mixed Blessing,"I don't like ""cooked"" coffee. Therefore, when coffee is made, I pour it into a carafe, so the last cup is as fresh as the first.The best thing about this carafe is it does keep the coffee warm for three hours. It is attractive and easy to clean. I have the brushed stainless steel model, and the exterior will shine right up using a soft cloth. The price is very reasonable.My biggest complaint is that the carafe ""dribbles"" when you pour the first cup and makes a mess; not a big mess, but an annoying one. Also, it is quite heavy when full. If I had to do it over, I think I would buy a smaller one. However, this one does hold a full pot of coffee (12-cup)."
1,It leaks,"If not fully upright, the liquid contents leak. The seal contains a stop which does not allow the user to close the top to maximum tightness. If you plan on transporting liquids in your vehicle, I do not recommend this carafe."
1,pretty exterior but.....,I bought it for the looks and guess what? Thats all I got. The lid does not fit tight however i could have lived with that. The main complaint is it leaked not from the top but out the bottom. Not just a drop or two it made a mess! Don't be fooled it is not made in Japan. Be prepared to return it.
4,Glass line 1 liter carafe,"Excellent product. Keeps coffee hot for several hours and doesn't impart a ""metallic"" taste as I have found with the all stainless steel models. Have not had any problems at all and works as expected. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a 1 liter glass-lined carafe."
5,Excellent Value,"I've been using my Zojirushi carafe for about a month now, and I believe it's awesome. Like the other reviews here note, it keeps your beverage hot for hours. For the money, it's a great deal.I'm using my Zojirushi 1-liter along with the Manual Drip Coffee Filter Cone by RSVP (can be found here on Amazon). If you've never tried manual drip, I recommend you give it a shot!"
1,Leaks if it is not upright,"I bought this to carry coffee to work. The first night I filled it with water and turned it upside down to see if it leaked, it did not. The next day I filled it with coffee and again turned it upside down, it leaked making it useless for my purposes. I don't know why it did not leak with water. I have tried replacing the o ring but that did not help. It does keep the beverage warm. But if you have to transport it where it is not upright you will have whatever is in it all over the place."
1,Liner breaks easily 4 of 5 shattered within 12 month period,"after owning a number of thermos' and other insulated bottles, this is the best at maintaining temperature and the easiest to break!parts are available thru zojirushi web site but with shipping and cost of gasket and liner ($3.90 and $8.60, respectively), cheaper to get another carafe. after buying 5 total during the past year, i'm down to my last one. thats it, going to another manufacturer.I did prechill the carafe before filling with ice-water and ice. i put a cup of cold water in the bottle after a prechill of an hour. Followed carefully with ice. Upon putting the 1st cube in the bottle, the glass liner loudly shattered. I have never seen liners break so easily. I did notice on the last bottle i have left, before using it, the glass liner was rather loose in the carafe. i took it apart, and hand tightened everything. so far okay. this is the last carafe i'll buy that is zorirushi made."
2,"Keep content warm, but leaky","I bought this carafe so that I can use it all day to keep water hot for making my tea. It does a very good job to keep water warm all day. But water can get in between the outer shell and liner easily and very often. Every time I pour water, it will leak through the seam under the spout. If I tilt it backward, it will leak through the seam under the handle. Sometimes, it will just leak because too much water go in between the outer shell and liner. I had to put paper tower underneath so my desk won't get wet.It is functionally good, but leaking water is definitly a problem."
5,LOVE THIS SMELL!!,"Black ICe is my favorite smell for the car and it lasts soooo long! When i got the 24 pack in the mail, i knew it was going to be 24 of them but holy cow 24 air fresheners is ALOT! I keep the whole bag in my car and probably wont have to buy air fresheners for the next 5 years :) They are so great to keep your car smelling fresh and even helps if people eat in your car ( you know that nasty McDonalds after smell?) just pop one out and your good to go! great buy so happy i got these."
1,no smell,"becareful here guys, do not last, maybe are too old, plus company doesn't respond you, I am really upset with this company they suppose to replace them but they never did."
1,Caution Removes paint on car console,"Works just like paint stripper, leave it sitting against your console for a couple of hours and the paint bubbles right up!"
1,Misleading description,"I ordered before brent birckhead's review came up and I got taken. This is not a leather case for LG enV VX-9900. The correct internal dimension is: 4"" x 1 3/4"" x 0.5"", clearly not a size that the VX9900 can fit into.Considering that the seller enters the ""product dimensions"" as 4 ounces instead of the measurments, one might suspect that this may not be an honest mistake.I think Amazon needs to take better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers fill out the description properly."
2,Cell Phone Case,"The case is nice, except I don't like the way it is sideways. I prefer a case that is vertical. Also, when you take the phone out of the case while it is ringing it automatically answers the call."
3,enV Holder,The case is stylish and light and the cell phone fits in nice and snug but the one problem with it is that the magnet doesn't work very well. The cover randomly opens up and it sometimes gives me problems while closing it.
4,Pretty good case for LG Env,"This is a pretty good case for LG Env. I do not use the belt clip, which is detachable.Cons: Only thing which I did not like is: you cannot charge your phone with this leather case on, otherwise it is a great cell phone case."
1,Poor Performance,In less than 3 months the tab on the cooker lid broke rendering the cooker useless. Very Poor quality in my opinion.
1,Zojirushi NS-PC10 Electric 5-Cup Rice Cooker,"Burns the rice in the bottom of pot when kept in warm mode. Too hot, even melted the edge of plastic rice spoon."
1,"Rice good, Part Cheap and Expensive to repair","The rice cooker is great...keeps the rice looking good for 2 days before it turns bad. I got this rice cooker over a year now, until one day I try to push open the rice cooker and the push button pop-out and broke a little part that holds the bottons together. Rice is good. Part is cheap. I would buy this item for no more then $50. Now I'll have to upgrade to a better cooker that has a stong and sturdy push open button."
4,Makes very good rice,"I had a problem with delivery where the first unit arrived with a bashed in product box, and the second arrived without even being double boxed. However, I'm happy with the product, and it makes good rice, and the keep warm function works well too."
4,Gets the job done,Bought this as a xmas gift for my mother-in-law. She is quite happy with it and uses it 4-5 times a week. Nothing fancy about it- rice comes out fine every time. It's been very reliable and consistent for the past 2 months.
2,Cook rice daily - disappointed for the brand (after 2-3 years?),"My parents had an awesome rice cooker that lasted well over 15 years, at least. Our Zojirushi was great at first, but has become a great disappointment. After one year of cooking rice 2-5 times a week, it began burning the rice at the bottom of the pan, oozing liquid out of the top, and undercooking the rice. We had to start adding an extra 1/2 cup (rice cup size) of water, which of course, made the oozing liquid worse. We never cook more than 2 1/2 cups of rice!Also, the ""warming"" function was a joke - dried out the rice. My parents' had a warmer that worked, so I wasn't aiming for the unrealistic ... and no, they didn't have a fuzzy logic cooker.Last week, the button that flips the lid open just snapped off. We take good care of our appliances, electronics, etc. so apparently, our rice cooker was only meant to have a short life.I still hold Zojirushi in high regard ... just not this particular model."
4,Rice in Minutes,"I love this rice cooker! It's made my life so much easier. It makes great rice but it turns out better when the rice has been presoaked. If you don't put the right amount of water, it tends to leave a film of inedible rice on the bottom but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty consistent. It's also pretty simple to clean up too.Though I wish it had the timer capability that many of the new ones do out on the market nowadays, all in all, it was a smart purchace!"
5,What a wonderful product..^_^..!,"What can I say. My mom picked this one with me, and it was her first time to shop online. She loves it and can't believe that she can find something that wonderful online. I just love it and use it everyday...!!!"
2,Burned rice on the bottom :(,"I just couldn't get this rice cooker to cook good rice for me. We eat mostly brown rice, so that is all I tried.Every time I cooked rice, there was a large layer of hard, burnt rice on the bottom of the pan. And since I only cook about 1 or 1.5 cups of rice at a time, this makes for an unacceptably large percentage of burnt rice out of the total cooked.Also, with brown rice, when using the normal ratio of 2 c water to 1 c rice, the rice was still uncooked. To get it cooked, I had to use 3 c water and cook it for a long time. And there was still that burnt layer!I am returning mine and will keep looking."
2,Too difficult to clean and nothing special,"The reason I'm writing this review is because of how difficult it is to clean the upper lid. I guess it's not meant to be cleaned thoroughly since the directions say to use a ""clean soft cloth moistened with hot water."" It CANNOT be detached like my old rice cooker.I wish I never purchased this thing. My old rice cooker was $20, way better at cooking rice, but the nonstick was gone after years of use and I thought I'd give Zojirushi a chance since their fuzzy logic ones are supposed to be the best. The rice is not that great that comes out of it. I've had lots of burnt rice at the bottom. Don't be fooled by the name brand. Rice cooking is not that difficult. Just go find a cheaper one that's easier to clean."
4,rice cooker and warmer,"This rice cooker does what it is supposed to: cooks perfect rice every time. It is very simple to operate. You do need to experiment to get proportions right, especially with different grains such as brown rice or heritage rices. Once you get them down, it will provide you with well-cooked, soft, fluffy rice. Keep in mind that the cup provided is not 8 ounces (it is less than that). That being said, if you work within the measurement system of the cooker, you can scale up or down as needed to cook different quantities of rice. I would say the only downside is that is that is doesnt have an automatic off. The warmer will stay on until you turn it off (I haven't actually tested this but it has stayed on for over an hour). The problem is that constant warming is still cooking and your rice will be dried out if you leave it too long. I think having the warmer turn off after 20-30 minutes would be a good feature to have."
2,Different experience from the other reviewers,"I bought this item from Amazon based solely from the reviews and the price. My experience was so disappointing that after trying 3 times, I gave up. Here's what happened: when cooking 1-2 cups medium grain rice, when the cook cycle finished, there was a substantial burnt/sticky later on the bottom, along with undercooked soggy rice on the top. I followed the instructional videos on Zojirushi's website, which told me to rinse the rice and measure it carefully. This did not help. It was not as good as the old Tiger rice cooker with fuzzy logic that I was replacing because it was quite old and too scratched inside.Now, after calling Zojirushi service, I am going to try again. They said that I should wait 15 minutes after the cook light goes off to let it finish steaming. Although I doubt it will solve the burnt rice layer at the bottom, maybe it will make the top more edible. Next time, I will get a fuzzy logic unit again."
1,not a reliable product and bad customer service,"I used to have a very cheap rice cooker ~$25 and I used it for ~5 years without any problem.After our family moved from CA to NJ, my husband insisted in buying this rice cooker although I think it is a little expensive. We finally got it because its good reviews from online. It worked fine for the initial two months then suddently the keep warm switch stopped working.I called the customer service, and they asked me to send the rice cooker to their local service for repairment. Apparently, there are not many local service stores in the country, at least NJ doesn't have one. The closest one is at NY and I have to ship my rice cooker at my own expense.I finally decided not bothering to do so since I would have to buy a second one if I had sent this one for repairment.I would never buy Zojirushi rice cooker again. I would not recommend it to anyone. It does not worth the money."
2,Not as good as Tiger JNP-1000,"The Tiger JNP-1000 will cook your rice more quickly, and the rice will last longer (it will not dry out as quickly as it does in the Zojirushi). The Tiger JNP-1000 is also easier to clean. It will cost a little more, but will be well worth it."
2,Indie Rock Lite,"It's not that I particularly dislike this band, I just think they're overrated on the college circuit. They're a great introduction to ""indie rock"" (not that that's a real genre, but you know what im talking about), but at the same time, their music is pretty empty. it seems like the majority of the album is just filler. ""Postman"" is a decent song, but it's nothing to cream your pants over. it's also good nap music. but i'd rather listen to belle and sebastian. but if you're 16 or younger and dont already listen to at least pavement, you should get this.side note-this band would actually be 20 times better if all of their songs were remixed by whoever remixed postman and they stopped being quite so weepy(it's implied)."
5,their best yet?,"3 albums into a career defined by gorgeous, minor chord drones and no-tempo jams that are reminiscent of the feelies and yo la tengo more than stereolab (to whom they are often compared), aas return with a daring new album of concise, beautiful songs. know by heart is one of the best albums of 2001. long time fans will want to spend a little extra time with this album toget used to the increased guitar and bass and the decreased organ but repeated listens will provide wonderful rewards."
4,Floats by like a lovely piece of gauze,"A dreamy album that makes me think a bit of the down-tempo intersection of Tortoise, Yo La Tengo and early days Death Cab. Late nights/early mornings, naps. Guitar, bass, drums (played w/ brushes, not sticks), vibraphone, hushed vocals. Drony, hypnotic, but varied enough to maintain interest. Rippling lake water."
5,Great product & length of trim,"Setting 5 = 1/2 inch, setting 4 = 3/8 inch, setting 3 = 1/4 inch, setting 2 = 3/16 inch, setting 1 = 1/8 inch. After seeing others reviews, I chose to use a disposable shaver for the clean bikini line, etc. but as a trimmer & shape this does a fantastic job! Really does work both dry & in the shower. I feel very safe using it with the adjustable guard on - NO ONE should be trimming with scissors while this great product is available, it's worth every penny!Remington BKT-2000 Trim and Shape Wet/Dry Bikini Trimmer"
5,When you want to wow them all...,"Want to really impress someone? Try this book. It offers clear directions with plenty of photos. Some of the recipies are time consuming, so be sure to take note of Anne's time estimations before you commit to the recipie. If you are newer at cooking, it will probably take you longer to fix these impressive deserts the first time. The deserts are chocolate to the extreme. Very popular with my co-workers was the Speckled Chocolate Cake. The meringue based cake covered with chocolate required nearly 2 hours of work time to complete, but was impressive. Not for everyday cooking, but a good chice when you have a little time and a crowd to impress!"
5,Gorgeous,I just received this item in the mail and it is absolutely perfect with summer coming. I'm 5'2 and 97 lbs and the sizing was correct. I highly recommend this product to anyone. It's simply elegant and very comfortable!
2,sizing,"I had to give it away. Although I do wear a medium, this gown was VERY VERY large and so I had to give it to a 150 lb woman..someone who is 5ft 3in tall, and weighs 125 lbs and wears normal medium would not be able to wear..it fell off me.So, just be careful when you buy. It was beautiful though...I have ordered before and had only one other I could not wear..it was so small I had to donate it as my twelve year old grand daughter was too young to wear it."
1,Extremely Dissapointed,"Cost vs. quality...I have to say cost wins! I expected a higher quality of nylon material for what these gowns cost, I would have to say judging by how thin this material actually is, the cheapest nylon was used to make these gowns. Also, the skirt is not as full as it looks online, and it is not 54"" long, as I am only 5'2"" & the gown & coat barely reach my ankles. As short as I am I expected this to reach the floor, at least it did when I measured myself before placing my order. The sleeves on the coat are too short and the darts for the fit of the bodice point outward rather than fitting snugly across the chest. If I were you I would think twice about wasting your hard earned money on these gowns, I plan on returning mine. When I spend $121 for 1 set & an extra gown I expect higher quality & a better fit!"
4,I love this robe,I was looking for something that is both pretty and comfortable. This robe is both. I liked it so much that I also ordered that night gown to go with it.
3,robe,This robe is very light and see-through. Not for the cold months. pretty but too low cut.Not worth the price.
1,A Grade 9 Project?,"Great title, great poem on the front cover. You can stop there. It is like someone said to write 100 pages, so the font and content were stretched to make up 100 pages. Don't waste $15 dollars."
2,Practice Cymbals,I bought these cymbals to hold me over while budgeting for a more expensive pair. I own a Wuhan china cymbal and it the best china I have ever heard so I was excited for these to come in the mail.I was very disappointed in how these hats sound. It almost sounds like playing with 2 top hats or a pair of marching cymbals. I would buy these cymbals if you want to give your good pair a rest in between gigs but prepare to not like their sound.
4,Rare B Side is Worth the Money,"With this CD, you get All Apologies and Rape Me, two very good songs, but both easily found elsewhere. A plus with this CD is the song Moist V, in which Kurt blends strange vocal techniques and punk riffs/feedback with even stranger lyrics. This song is a definite commentary on the pre-suicide months of Kurt Cobain's life. For $12.99, it's an inexpensive, well-recorded must for all Nirvana collectors."
3,All Apolgies and Marigold glitter dispite the mess of MV,"Annoyed at the positive reviews of this single, I'm stepping out with a negative comment on the song censered here to 'Moist V.' MV seems to be a warm up song for the recording of the In Utero album, and I don't see it worthy of release, although the remaining 2 selections on this single glow. I was shocked to find such a simple, unlistenable song released on the same single as the sparkling All Apolgies and Dave Grohl's wonderous Marigold..."
5,Huzzah,"This is totally worth the money if you like Nirvana or grunge music in general. ""All Apologies"" and ""Rape Me"" are two totally great songs from the In Utero album but the real reason to get this is the b-side ""Moist Vagina"". It's probably just meant as a joke but it's still a great song."
4,Nirvana's Last Single,"This was the last single that Nirvana released while Kurt Cobain was alive. The b-side that's included, embarrassingly titled ""Moist Vagina"", is pretty good if you liked ""In Utero"" and was a nice addition to my collection."
5,"Buy this for ""Moist Vagina""","This is a great single. Wonderful artwork, great songs, and it's readily availible for purchase by other sellers on Amazon. 'All Apologies' is a lovely song, one of the best on 'In Utero'. 'Rape Me' is another excellent track off 'In Utero'. But the real gem here is 'Moist Vagina', this particular version only available on this single (an alternate version is on the 'With The Lights Out' boxset). And the song does not dissapoint, with it's wonderfully raunchy lyrics and an over-all good perforance by the band. Sadly, this is Nirvana's last single. Nonetheless, I strongly recommend it be purchased by any Nirvana fan, new or old."
4,"Disposable, requires strong grip","Childproofing features mean that this product requires a strong grip. Not for the elderly or arthritic wanting an easy fireplace lighter. My elderly parent could not light it using both hands. Works great for me, but it was supposed to have been a helpful gift. Also, I would not have ordered had I known it was disposable. I don't fault the product, which probably will work well for you, but the description is incomplete."
1,Very unreliable lighters,"I ordered 4 of them. They very quickly became extremely unreliable to light, I'm talking an average of 20 clicks to get a flame. Threw them out even before I had used up 1/4 of the fuel in them and ordered some better ones."
1,Don't buy unless you're young with very strong hands,"Even using both hands, I'm unable to make one of these light, due to arthritis in my hands. I wrote Bic about it and they didn't even reply. My son took one apart tonight trying to dismantle the child-proof feature for me, but all it did was break the darn thing. I bought a four-pack, so I threw out the broken one and gave him the other three. He said it was even hard for his hands to light."
1,Short life span,I bought this lighter for my business because i have gas powered coffee machine. I used this lighter for about 3 weeks lighting it 4 or 5 times a day on average and it began dying with more than half of the gas left inside. After about a month it was a guess whether or not it would work when i used it..so i just threw it out and bought a better one. save your money...def not worth it
2,Not the greatest gloves.,"These ran on the small side and have a lot of rubber on them which makes them hot to wear. They were cheap, though, so I guess you get what you pay for."
4,pretty good compilation-adapted to higher voice,This book has a nice number of Broadway numbers-all for soprano voice. But beware...........the accompaniament is altered from the original score-as are some of the words. So if you want the authentic music from the show........this may not be for you.
2,VERY disappointing,"I owned a Rival crockpot for 20 years and was very happy with it. When it stopped working I therefore bought another (this one) from Rival. I've used it twice. The top doesn't seem to keep the liquid in, even on low, and it burned the food both times. I don't trust it now and am not sure whether I'll try it again."
2,So-So,"I have only two complaints about my new crock pot. The lid is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE! It is not nearly heavy enough to keep steam from escaping. This causes the food to lose moisture, not to mention the condensation that formed on my counter and then ran down the front of my cabinets. Thank goodness I still had the old one and salvaged the heavy glass lid from it - and it fit this one! The second complaint is that it cooks much hotter/faster than the pot I had previously. This may be due to the loss of steam and drying of the contents. If I use the heavy glass lid and cook on low, it does OK but what about those who don't have a glass lid that fits? I guess they're just out of luck. Bottom line is I would not recommend this model to anyone."
5,RIVAL DOES IT AGAIN EXCELLENT PRODUCT,JUST RECEIVED MY RIVAL CROCKPOT LAST WEEK AND HAVE USED IT TWO TIMES SO FAR. FIRST TIME I MADE A POT ROAST WITH VEGETABLES AND IT CAME OUT UNBELIEVEABLE TENDER AND MOIST. YESTERDAY I MADE A BUTTERBALL TURKEY ROAST WITH VEGETABLES. IT ALSO CAME OUT DELICIOUS. THIS IS MY FIRST CROCKPOT. IT COOKS GREAT. I AM GOING TO GIVE MY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES ONE EACH FOR XMAS. THANK YOU RIVAL FOR SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT AND THANK YOU AMAZON FOR THE BEST PRICE FOR THIS PRODUCT. HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
1,Way too hot for slow cooking!,"We have been very disappointed with this crock pot. Liquids come to a steady, rolling boil when it is set to ""low"". High is too high for any kind of cooking. Unless you can stop home at noon to switch the setting to warm, your dinner will be burnt everytime. We gave up on this after only six weeks and replaced it with a Hamilton Beach. Don't waste your money on this heap of junk!"
5,Great crockpot for a lower price.,"I chose this one because it was less expensive. It's not too giant and not too small. Does what it says it does, and cleans up easily. I haven't used the little crockpot that comes with it, but it's very cute and would be perfect for a warm cheese dip or chocolate to dip fruit in."
1,Lid on crock pot.,The lid does not fit and is not heavy enough to keep it firmly on the pot.It allows liquids to escape.I think this could be a problem.
3,Cooks too Hot but Warms fine.,"I do think it cooks way to hot even on low for a crockpot, but I received it as a gift with ""Fix-It and Forget-It Cookbook"" that helped alot with ideas. You can use this one fine if you are home while it is a cooking and adjust the time up by about 2 hours and use the Low setting. I also found the insert hard to clean and food did stick to it. But for 20 dollars it does seem worth it, and it does look nice and the outside cleans up fine. I didn't notice a problem with the lid at all.Good luck, my last one didn't work this well it boiled over all the time and I had to throw it in the trash.Happy CookingSingle Mommy"
2,Too Hot on Low!!!,I bought this slow cooker after deciding to give away my old Crock Pot (which I now regret) and I too have the problem that foods cook too fast on low. I'll be looking to hopefully return this one for something different.
2,Not your mom's crock pot but not as bad as the next Rival we bought,"We got a crock pot for our wedding 13 years ago that we loved until the lid (plastic) fell apart. This was our first attempt at a replacement. The lid does NOT work well for this pot. The moisture constantly bubbled over, making a mess on the cabinet. My children frequently commented on the lid getting ready to ""take off"". I used it less and less before deciding to replace it. If the lid worked better, I'd probably still be using it. As it is, it is sitting collecting dust."
3,Now what do I do?,"I have a Rival Crockpot very similar to this one. The lid is exactly the same. Tonight I was making soup, lifted the lid and the plastic handle broke off of the lid. Now what do I do? Also, when soup is cooking in the crockpot the built up steam makes the lid rattle, this is kind of annoying Other than that, I like the crockpot...but the lid and handle definitely need some re-vamping!"
4,Hot!,It's great! Perfect size and the removeable inside pot is great for clean up when I forget to use crock pot liners. My only issue is that it seems to run hot on low so I sometimes have to switch it to warm to keep it from cooking too fast.
2,"works, sometimes.....","old crock pot burned out and have been using this one for about a year - gets either too hot or not hot enough, inconsistent. also gets hotter on the low setting and internal wires seem to be crossed - plan to replace with a different brand soon as our potato soup this evening was not cooked after 2 hours of cooking"
3,This book feels like it's missing a foot,"By which I mean it leans on occasion. The book's title originally led me to believe it was going to be a wholesale bashing of the Presidency of George W. Bush rather than a scholarly research piece. While the book ended up being well written and documented, I couldn't help but feel the author's claims and conclusions weren't at least a little bit biased against Bush. The author would often go out of his way to point out fallacies and mistakes in the Republican/Bush campaigns, while ignoring that the Democrat camps would often make mistakes that were just as egregious. Also, a very heavy reliance on the works of Bob Woodward raised questions. If you're looking for a strictly scholarly piece, this book is close, but no cigar. You can find much of the same valuable information in the book ""Culture War"" by Morris Fiorina, without the slant."
1,total screwup,"The ad is for a point driver. What you get is a big box of points that are taped together to fit into the driver. You can use the points and drive them in by hand, but you first have to seperate them from the taped edge. might be a good deal if you are looking for points. Doesn't gut it if you are looking for a driver."
1,Very Unhappy!,I thought I was ordering the Point driver because the image is of a point driver but recieved a box of flex points instead... Very unhappy!
1,Kindle edition,"The Kindle version of this isn't formatted the way the book is formatted, and the lead sheets aren't held to one screen. Would be cool to have the book on an ipad even if it's a tad small, but I can't swipe the screen back and forth while playing something. Just thought you'd want to know before you hit the button."
1,It does not have the feature I need,I have expected this one to have the delay-timer as the others one do. But it does not. That's a must feature that I need. and I have to return it. The description could have been easier on Amazon website or at least it should have a better picture to show this.
5,What do you want to know?,"Mine broke after a couple of months. Won't cook the rice, but warmer stays on."
1,Defective Zojirushi Rice Cooker,"When I received my zojirushi rice cooker, I quickly discovered that the ""cook"" button will not pop out, so the rice cooker will not automatically switch over from the ""cook"" mode to the ""warm"" mode. It keeps on cooking until we notice that it is burning. Furthermore, even after we unplug it, the button still won't pop out unless I pry it out with a knife. I am afraid that the button is going to break, so I have to return the whole item to the manufacturer. This was not what I expected when I purchased this [price] item from Amazon.com. I'm sure that this is just a single defective rice cooker, but it is still a real aggravatio for me personally!"
3,Not worth the money,"The List Price on Amazon is very deceiving. This rice cooker List Price is $232. I bought this for $110 and thought I got a great deal. I went to an asian market and found the same rice cooker for $105 regular price. You just have to know what you are buying and what price other places are selling them for.Rice cooker ok, nothing fancy about this. I wished it had a timer though. If you don't plan on eating the rice for 2-3 days, take it out of the cooker and put it in the fridge. The rice cooker seems like it's constantly cooking the rice instead of keeping it warm. I think I have a defective cooker. Not worth the money."
4,This is a great cooker,It has been working great so far. The rice quality comes out fine. Its just too big to move around. So far so good. Lets see how its life is (one of the biggest problems with rice cooker: they fail quick)
5,Zojirushi Rice Cooker,"It is a great rice cooker so far! It's a good deal price for this name(Zojirushi). I would recommend it to anybody. After using it for awhile now, I have no complaints; the rice is cooked well and thoroughly. It's fresh everytime you open up the cooker."
5,zojirushi ns pc 18,awesome product. bought another! the rice always stays moist and never sticks to the bottom of the insert. very easy to use. would not buy another brand.
4,Perfect sushi rice every time!,We have owned this rice cooker for 6 years and have used it about 3 times/week every week. It makes perfect sushi rice every time. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is that it does not do a great job with brown rice which needs a longer cooking time - we still cook that rice stove top. It is a dependable high quality product (unlike coffee makers and toasters these days which seem to last less than 12 months). We LOVE our rice cooker!
2,"Soft materials stink, literally","I chose the Techno Classic over the Techno XT because it comes with a head roll and foot bag. I'm happy with the stroller, but beware of one thing: you cannot use it out-of-the-box because the materials emit such foul fumes!When I unpacked my new stroller, I was nearly knocked over by the strong smell of plastics and solvent due to toxic outgassing. It was the ""new car smell,"" but 100 times worse than you could imagine. I literally got a headache after being in the vicinity of the stroller for about a minute and I was forced to move the stroller outside. I removed all the liners and washed them three times and the stroller sat outside for 2 weeks before I dared to put my infant in it.Also, as mentioned in other online reviews, MacLaren customer service is non-existent. I sent them 2 messages and no response after 4 weeks. So the stroller gets 4 stars, but toxic fumes and bad customer service each deserve a minus."
5,LICENSE PLATE,THE HUMMINGBIRD THAT WAS AIRBRUSHED ON THIS LICENSE PLATED IS SO COLORFUL AND MATCHES THE COLOR OF MY CAR. I'M GLAD I BOUGHT THIS ONE.
5,"Good Balsamic vinegar, especially for the price.","Perfect online transaction. Came packaged to survive and air-drop, so it arrived in perfect condition and on time. The vinegar has a much richer and more complex taste than other balsamics, especially at its price."
1,Not the real thing,"Folks, I ordered this based on reviews I had read here. I wish that Amazon would at least provide the information on the label so a consumer can make a educated choice. First and foremost, this is not real balsamic vinegar. It is Wine Vinegar & cooked grape must, with a acidity of 6%. True Balsamic Vinegar ingredients is: ""is made from the Trebbiano grape. The rich brown color comes from being aged in wood casks, often for decades. Although it is made from grapes, balsamic vinegar isn't produced from wine (as are most vinegars). The authentic product may not contain any wine vinegars - the grape juice is simply reduced and then made directly into vinegar."" and will have acidity of 4%.I made the mistake of opening my bottle and will see if Amazon will take it back."
3,Not that good...,"This vinegar does not taste like 20 years old. I have bought in Italy a 15 years old balsamic for about the same price, and there is a big difference between the two. This La Piana is much mroe acidic and lacks the sweet taste and the thick look the other has. Won't order this item again..."
5,Good value for money,I have purchased this product for the second time now as I feel it the best value for money balsamic vinegar. I use it primarily as salad dressing.
5,Good quality witch's hat!,"I bought 2 of these hats and am glad I spent the extra money, because they will serve for dress up for years to come! Nice quality hat and I love that it's got a built-in adjuster to tighten for my 3 year old's head (and 6 year old's head)! FYI: it fits my head, too! Comfortable and not cheap looking."
4,Very small witch hat,I ordered this hat for myself since I have a small head. It was too small for my jr. high student. Very cute but definitely for a late elementary schooler.
4,Runs a little small,"I really love this hat except that, like the other reviewers mentioned, it DOES run small. It sits on my head and fits half-ways like a normal hat should, but it doesn't stay on if something bumps it. I'm using it for a complete Prof. McGonagall costume and so I'll have to have my hair in a bun. I figure I'll just pin it with some bobby pins to keep it securely in place while I'm wearing it. If it would fit like a hat should I'd have definitely given it a 5 star review."
2,a bit too small but fits on my average head,A bit small but just frumpy looking. I guess Mcgonagall's hat is supposed to have that look? It's nice a soft.
2,Pretty Small/ Not for adults,"I bought this hat for halloween. It arrived very quickly, within 3 days. I was pretty excited with how it looked and the way it was made but once I tried it on it really didnt fit. Now I am a pretty small person. My height is 4'll so you could say I am the average size of a 12 year old child but this hat really didnt fit me and I am sure I will have to pin it so it doesnt fall off. I would probably only purchase this for a child may be 4-8 years of age. It is built very well and I can use it for one of my childrens costumes."
1,Way too Small,"This hat is durable and the design is cute however it's TINY! The hat is pictured on what appears to be an adult but it does not even fit my 6 year old, who I bought it for. It's way too small. Very disappointed since she will not be able to wear it and it cannot be returned."
5,Wonderful Technique Book on Zhostovo Painting!,"After studying Zhostovo painting in Ontario, Canada, with Heather, I found this book to be of great benefit to refresh my learned skills. It has explicit instruction on leaves, flowers, and designing your own linework borders which are very beautiful, yet the guidelines are easy to construct using a compass. The book is easy to follow and her technique is of the finest. You will master brush control if you follow her detailed instruction on strokes. How to load a brush is detailed in depth and no stone is left unturned in this area. I can feel the rhythm and movement in the clear illustrated pictures. A great book to study from...a great teacher to show you how!"
5,As a new ESL Teacher...This book is FANTASTIC,"I often get stumped on new ideas for ""game day"" and this book has helped a great deal in regards to making game day different while learning important grammar in the process. I will never leave home without this book!It has all different levels of games that you can change to meet the needs of your age group.It is very easy to do all activities even if you are in a place without any resources. So now, instead of wondering what to do, I am now looking forward to game day along with my students.I definately recommend this book for new ESL teachers who aren't creative enough (like me!) to come up with new ideas each week.Happy Teaching!"
1,Where's the organization?,"While some of the activities presented in the book look interesting, most are dull and purposeless. Additionally, the organization of the book is extremely poor. While there is an improved table of contents over ""Grammar Games"" it is still a time-consuming process to find an activity for the grammar material being presented in class. Better books are Ur's ""Grammar Practice Activities"" or Woodward's ""Fun with Grammar"". Don't waste your money on the Rinvolucri books."
5,Excellent!,"I've read almost every magickal book on the market and this is one of the best. The spells are easy to follow and execute even if you're on a budget. They are beautifully written, and are excellent templates to add your own touches to if desired. Edain McCoy proves that it doesn't take anything complicated or highly ceremonial to achieve your desired results. In addition to all this, the author spends time lending her extremely helpful and very smart advice in the area of romance, lending an ear to both sides of the ethical debate of manipulative/non-manipulative practices. Most importantly she respects your free will in the decision of which side of the ethical fence to play on, offering sound advice and fair warning of potential consequences while not withholding valuable knowledge. If you're even vaguely interested in the magickal arts, this book is a must have in your collection!"
1,Chair was Defective,"This chair arrived fully assembled, but defective. Two plastic ""C"" shaped ""holders"" on the left side (facing the chair)were broken. Because the ""holders"" were broken, the chair would not remain unfolded. The defect caused the chair to be unstable. When I pulled the chair out of the box I noticed two black plastic pieces in the bottom of the box. These turned out to be half of each of the ""C"" shaped ""holders."" I don't know whether the chair was shipped in this condition, or if the plastic broke during shipping, but any part that is necessary for the stability of a wheel chair should not be plastic, and should not be so easily breakable. I received the chair yesterday and am returning it today. I wouldn't recommend this chair."
1,Made with very soft plastic,"The wallet has not been leather, was made with very soft plastic. the wallet is broken, disengaged and ragged in one day"
3,Basement Jaxx - Bingo Bango,"Bingo Bango is great club fodder, there's no doubt, but it's my least favorite of the singles off of Remedy. Why? Not enough of that maverick Basement Jaxx spirit -- it sounds like any other Latin house track that's come out over the last few years. Harry Romero's mix doesn't quite lift it from that slump, and the Stanton Warriors Mix of ""Jump N' Shout"" makes me jump but not shout with its 2-step breaks."
5,Good,Exactly what I wanted and paid for and is working great for removing the transmission is my saturn. I am every pleased.
5,Great historical content,Researching my indian heritage and even though the childrens stories were riveting the historical content was awesome. would love to find a copy of other book written by the Smith Brothers.
5,"Riveting, even for people with no prior interest in subject","Great find! Many people have borrowed my copy of this book, and everyone has reviewed it favorably.Two things really stood out:1. This book is a must for anyone who has ever been immersed in a foreign culture. It is interesting to see that even under these circumstances, people returning home have great difficulties adjusting.2. The settlers who attempted to bring their German homeland (through agriculture and permanent settlements) to the frontier brought a lot of hardship to their families. The Indians didn't have to live as hand to mouth, didn't starve, and didn't work as hard as they did. The fact that the settlers tried to plant their hamlets in the middle of the Texas frontier (rather than adjusting appropriately for the circumstances) seems absurd and hardly German pragmatic. Small wonder that the abducted children resented their birth families and typically didn't want to go home."
3,The Captured by Scott Zesch,"""A True Story of Abduction by Indians on the Texas Frontier."" Zesch tells the story of several persons who were abducted by the Indians (Native Americans). In the 1800s, many children, most of them white children, were taken by the Plains Indians and adopted into the tribes. When attempts to rescue them came, many resisted. They preferred the Indian way of life and found it very difficult in returning to the world from which they had been taken. Many remained loyal to their Indian family; Many continuously attempted to return to them. The book is interesting and informative but I must say that toward the end, it became a tedious read."
4,RonfromOregon,An extremely interesting history of the Great Plains Indians and the White captives. The author did an amazing job of researching to obtain a complete story of true events.
5,Eye Opening into our murky past.,"I bought this book to do a little research on the old west, never expecting to be blown away by the contents. We've all heard the horrible stories of what happened to white settlers when captured by the Indians. But I'd never heard the stories from the captives, themselves. I'd never realized that sometimes the Indians took captives to replace the loved ones they'd lost for whatever reason. Not all of them were tortured, or treated badly. In some cases, the captives had better lives with their captives than they had before, in often poverty level circumstances.Scott Zesch's book about his own relative is excellent. You won't want to put it down once you start it. He's given me a whole new understanding of a time that I've always felt drawn to, as if I was born out of time. I heartily recommend this book whether you're doing research on the era, or just want an entertaining, and honest look into an era of our past we should hold no pride in."
5,Awesome book! A Must read!!!!,This book was a required read in my history class and I'm glad it was! I loved this book and I couldn't put it down!
4,they lived in both worlds.....,"An excellent account and study of several Indian captives stolen in Texas frontier times, by a family relation of a captive. Gives a vivid rendering of the intense danger of frontier life in central Texas during the mid nineteenth century period. A must read for Texas historians who are interested in the perspective of those who lived with both the Indians and the whites. The detailed accounts give deep reasons and an understanding for the Indian wars that wracked Texas until 1874."
5,Awesome Historical Book!!,Great read for those who want to learn the true history of United States and what happened with native tribes struggling to keep their way of life as well as shinning light to what western life was really like not the sugar coated text books you read in middle and high school! Definitely recommend it!!!
4,Great overall,"This is a great product. It is very stylish, instead of some black ugly thing. I do not notice any change in sound, and the strap is too long. I like the strap on mine to be short, and I had to do some modifications to get it short enough."
3,:/,"It also feels cheap and plasticky, the bottom doesn't seem to have that much grip either. Not sure if it will work too well."
4,Hungarian Airforce WW2,"I found this book very informative. Although not a large volume, it is packed with information and an interesting selection of photos. Essential reading for information on this topic, on which there is not a lot of information in English. Worth adding to your library"
1,Hungarian Eagles: The Hungarian Air Forces 1920-1945,"If you want see many pictures, take this book. If you want know something about RHAF, this book really not very usefull. Almost nothing about operation, not clearity about losses (let alone loss lists) against Soviet Air Force (more clear losses against US in 1944), nothing about ground support units and operation, etc."
5,Nice Quality!,"The quality of this costume is very nice The material is that fake velvet, and the ""S"" is a actually a large patch. Usually kids costumes are a thin material that are dyed with the design, but not this. It's worth the money, and any little girl would be very happy to have it."
4,Good Costume for the money,"Bought this costume for Halloween and it's a pretty good buy. The skirt is VERY short and feels delicate (I'm scared to rip it pulling it off), but that's to be expected from women's halloween costumes. My major problem is that it is VERY hot (but thank god I'm in Chicago and now I won't need a coat) and the boot covers are EXTREMELY small. They're very, VERY tight over my calves (which aren't particularly large and fit into boots with no problem) and don't even cover the top of my shoe. I want to wear the boot covers so that the costume is complete, but part that is supposed to cover the top of your foot is too short to cover the top of my size 9 feet. I tried to stretch them down, but I'm afraid they will rip because the quality isn't that great."
4,Great quality and looks really nice,"Most costumes I've found at this price point are cheaply made from cheap materials. This Supergirl costume was a pleasant surprise. The colors are vivid and rich and the fabric is actually fairly sturdy and nice. The blue bodice is a medium weight, stretchy velveteen, and the skirt and attached cape are a substantial sort of glossy, metallic red fabric. I bought it for my tall (34 inches) but thin (26 pounds) 18 month old daughter for Halloween, and it actually fit her really well, other than the belt, which was too big, but I easily fixed that with some velcro strips. And it still fits her now that she's grown an inch and gained 2 pounds, because of the stretchy velvet, I think. The only thing that is not great are the boot covers, which my daughter refuses to wear because they slide around on her legs and foot in an annoying way that can make her trip. Even after Halloween, she still likes to play dress up in her Supergirl costume."
3,Pretty good for the price,"I recieved my order promptly, with in a couple of days of ordering. There was a 2 inch hole along one of the seams, but I just broke out my sewing kit & crudely stitched it back together. The fabric is decent quality as far as costumes go, & it looked go on. I am glad I read the previous reviews about the sizes running larger than normal. I ordered an extra small & it fit perfectly. I normally wear a size 4."
4,"Cute costume, short skirt!","Overall I am satisfied with this costume, though the skirt is a little on the short side. Which is probably fine for some... just be prepared! Tights helped... Also, sizing reviews said costume runs big, and the sizing chart said the XS fits women with dress sizes 0-6. I'm 5'5"" and about 120 pounds, and my typical dress size is 0-2. The XS did fit, but it fit well... not at all roomy, so it felt more like it fit true to size than running large. The fabric around the neckline tore before I even wore the costume, but I'm giving them a break here since it was probably because I kept pulling on the bottom of the skirt trying to stretch it out.Costume does come with fake ""boots""... you can pull them over your legs like boots and then attach a strap on the bottom over a pair of shoes. Have to have the right pair of shoes though for it to look right... I ended up ordering the super girl boots instead..."
2,Not great...,"Runs big, I bought a small n it was huge on me ... unless you have huge boobs n are a stick figure its not gonna fit."
5,"Bought for a friends daughter, super cute on her",Seemed to be better made than some other costumes we've bought and it really did look adorable on her. She really liked it!
5,Superhero Greatgranddaughter loved this,"I bought this for my little greatgranddaughter and it was a terrific hit. It was purchased in September and she wore it for dressup through Halloween when it became her costume. It seemed a bit pricey, but it was durable and held up well. I love the photos of her as a true superhero."
1,I didn't receive the costume shown in the picture,"I just want to let you know that my daughter and myself were so deceived because although the picture showed a one piece suit, we received a two-piece one, which lets your tummy be seen. It was even more disappointing because I even sent you an email asking you to make sure that it was the one-piece the one you were sending me, and you answered that you would be sending the one shown in the picture in Amazon, but I didn't receive that one!Secret Wishes Supergirl Costume"
4,Cool Super Girl costume,"I love this costume. I'm very petite so the xs was perfect for me. I loved the color and the fabric. The only problem I see with it is that the skirt is a bit short on the back, and since it is such a lightweight material you have to be very careful."
5,Such a cute costume!,"My five year old daughter wanted a super hero birthday party so I thought I would splurge on costumes since Halloween will be right around the corner. I love this costume! It is so cute and the red is so pretty and shiny. You definitely have to get the real boots that are sold on Amazon because the boot covers won't stay over the toes. So with the boots and this cute little number, I think I'm going to be Super Girl for Halloween for at least the next few years, and probably at risk for becoming the ""creepy super girl lady from down the street."""
4,Nice,"Very cute, runs a little big, had to get an extra small. I wear jeans size 3-5 and size small-med shirts. Still had a little room. The boot covers are snug though, but worked out just fine. Get them on and don't plan on taking them off til the end of the night."
5,My little superhero,"I bought this as my daughter's 2 year old birthday costume and she looked so cute in it, it is really good quality, I would have a little person wear a vest underneath it though because she did start pulling at it. Wonderful product."
4,"Good fit, pretty short, otherwise very satisfied","This is just like the photos. I wear a medium, ordered a medium, and it fits. The skirt is a bit short, but not a big deal. The belt is also oddly long - I'll need to take it in a little. Ok...a lot.The spats for the boots are cute, but you really have to have matching red shoes to wear under them to make them look good. Otherwise, they will look a little silly. They don't cover the toes."
2,Fit is weird,"Eh, skirt is really short! Top is an odd fit. Don't like the legging covers. I wish it fit better, because I like the look and the material is ok for costumes."
3,Good for what it is...,"This item arrived in timely fashion, but did have a tear right along the upper seam, which was an easy fix. However, I am a normal size 0-2 in stores and this fit really large. I had to have it taken in before Halloween because it was so large. Definitely order a size down. Not a bad costume, and the material is nice."
3,its ok!,"The delivery was on time and arrived before the estimated date.I purchased the Large costume: boot covers seem old, the color of fabric was all shattered like it has being there a long time and doesn't cover well the bottom of the feet area.The top is a good fabric is corduroy. The skirt is short in the back; I have to wear mini shorts so that I will not be showing anything. The belt is uncomfortable, it has no support like the cape to maintain it in place and will be putting you all night in check mode if it is out of place, and it would be!I'm a 5""6 size 12 to 14 and fit very well. Same the boot covers."
4,"Love the costume, but the boot covers don't do it justice","I absolutely love this costume! It is great quality, and the materials used seem like they will hold up. My only complaint is the boot covers...they don't attach to the boot quite right, so I just ordered some actual boots a few minutes ago and will see how they look. I got the Funtasma by Pleaser Women's Wonder-130 Knee-High Boot. They look almost identical to the boot covers. Hopefully those will work, but like I said, otherwise the costume is great!"
3,hair does feel stronger but not impressed,it works a bit to make it stronger but it wares out on about a week. It gives you enough for 6 applications so is ok for the value I guess.
1,I guess this doesn't work for everyone,"I had high hopes for this product. My hair is very thick and wavy, and has become extremely dry for some reason, so I thought I'd give this a try. I'm on the 3rd application and my hair is getting worse. I followed the directions religiously, but it seems to be frying my hair. Oh well, at least it wasn't expensive."
1,WHAT????,"I purchased this based on the good reviews,....what a waste! I don't know how this could improve anyones hair. This is junk. It made my hair dry or drier than it was and it took a week for it to recover."
4,New Fan to Dan Simmons books,"It was hard to read this book at first because of the situation in Romania and the children's orphanages. I remember seeing it on the news and how disturbing it was. It was a horrific and very difficult to watch. In the end, I am glad I read the book, really enjoyed Dan Simmons style and his beginning narrative leading into the story. I have never read his books before and I am always on the hunt to read different authors. I am into the third book of Dan Simmons's (Winter Haunting) and It is nice to find the grown up characters in different stories."
3,Not too impressed...,"What I enjoy most about Simmon's Song of Kali and Carrion Comfort is that they are very different from a lot of horror fiction. I thought Children of the Night would likely be a new and different take on vampires- and it is. The scientific explanation of vampires is fascinating but that and the true stories of Vlad the Impaler are really the only interesting things about this book. It pretty much follows the same story format as most of Dean Koontz's books: Hero and heroine battle a supernatural villian, or villians which turn out to have a natural explanation; along the way they have a graphically descriptive sex scene before destroying the bad guys and living happily ever after. It doesn't have the intensity of Song of Kali or the thrills of Carrion Comfort and the characters aren't that interesting. It's not a bad book but it's not one that many people will treasure either."
5,Not your average cheesy vampire novel,"Dan Simmons is a wonderful, talented writer who doesn't write on a 12 year old level. This book is more than just a quick thrill, but a wonderfully researched and realized novel with wonderful development, plot, suspense and characters. If you're looking for a cheap thrill, don't read this novel - if you're looking for a mature, realized vision of a vampirism, this is the book for you! A wonderful read even if you're not into vampires and 'horror' stories."
2,A misfire from the master.,"Perhaps I was spoiled by reading Dan Simmons' excellent horror novels A Song of Kali and Carrion Confort (both of which I highly reccomend) but Children of the Night somehow falls flat. The author's take on vampirism as some sort of disease is nothing new, and what's worse, he bogs down the story with the most excesive and boring medical jargon imaginable. The story itself is slow moving and rather uninteresting since Dan Simmons is more intent in impressing the reader with his knowledge of modern day Romania (with which we get endless descriptions of unpronounsable locations) than in moving the story forward."
4,fascinating evil story bound to modern hematology,"Dan Simmons is a fantastic story teller. He describes ""modern"" Romania in such a black way, that one can believe that out of the depths of such modern evil could lurk the ancient evil of vampires. His use of modern hematology and immunology to describe the vampire legend is pure creative genius. Does he know something the rest of us don't. It's almost as if he's describing from first hand knowledge. There were elements in the action which required a suspension of belief. Even vampire legends should be consistent. All in all it's one of the best books of its genre and an excellent read"
3,Great read except for the end,"I thought this was an entertaining, original, and generally well written horror novel. The only thing I could not get past was the end which was a little too much like an A-Team episode for my liking. I almost expected someone to light a cigar and say ""I love it when a plan comes together."" But that aside it was a good book and I have yet to read a Dan Simmons book I really did not like."
4,What a fun twist on the Dracula story!,"Though a bit slow to start, and rather predictable, I enjoyed this book. The medical vampirism made for a unique and interesting twist. And Dracula, or Vlad, himself was a fascinating counterpoint to the modern action. By the end, the pacing picked up and it was over all together too quickly.I would hardly count this as being a sequel to _Summer of Night_, though it was nice to see a grown up Mike O'Rourke. Unfortunately, he hardly seemed reminiscent of that eleven year old boy and there were only brief hints made to the action of 1960. The historical chapters added a rich level to the story and I wish that there had been more of it - so many more centuries could have been covered!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"More of a standard vampire tale than Carrion Comfort, a scientist working on AIDS adopts a Romanian child. She finds out that its blood has unusual properties, not realising that the baby is a vampire child.This gets a few people killed, and with some help from the usual sort of vampire book allies she sets out to find out what is going on, and perhaps cure a disease."
4,A Story of Two Lovers and Their Love of Climbing.,"This is a love story about two married mountain climbers, whose final climb together takes place in the beautiful Tatras mountains of Slovakia.It has beautiful naratives, authentic characters, as well many thoughtful relections.The book ends in Slovakia near the end of the Communist era and recalls to mind how awful that period was in Eastern Europe. How quickly we forget.It is a good read for climbers or non climbers alike, and for anyone interested in the realities of life in Eastern Europe before the Wall came down."
1,I actually stopped reading it,"I rarely stop reading a book once I've started it. Can count on one hand the number of times I've done that--and this was one of those times. Dark, depressing and written like a draft in a writer's workshop. Lacks character development and any ray of hope/light."
1,Not authentic,"The editor has chosen not to include the 10 books of the so-called ""Apocrypha"", which was definitely read by the Holy Apostles. The NT even quotes from them! Without these books this becomes just another modern Bible following the Protestant tradition."
3,Not Worthy,"Disappointed. I had such high hopes for this item. It is an over-glorified electric fry pan, no better than its cheaper counterparts. And as other reviews state, has a really small cooking area. The one I received had a sloppily-applied label, air pockets throughout -- this label goes across the front of the item & lists the temperatures. For the price, I expected better quality. And note that this is not made in Japan. It is made in China. This should be listed on the specifications. I really like Amazon, but not this product, and will be returning it."
5,Excellent Product,"This electric skillet is well made. The pan, which sits inside the heating unit, is heavy and heats evenly. Unlike the previous electric skillet I purchased this one can be kept on a low temperature without having it intermitently go into a furious boil to keep the correct temperature.I have another Zojirushi product (a bread making machine) which is also a quality product.I am very pleased with both Zojirushi products."
5,ZO Gourmet d' Expert,"This has to be the best counter-top cooker EVER! Versatile in every respect. Perfect for a batch of prunes. Bacon does not splatter, eggs perfect every time, fried or poached. The heat control is excellent and even over the whole pan, unlike the usual fry pan item with hot spots and heat ""surge"" every time the thermostat kicks in. The Titanium no stick, magnetic cord socket, micro adjustments of temperature control, over-all superior build quality make this item a value when compared to anything else available. My 10"" Cusinart frypan is now on a back shelf, destined for a new home with a deserving Grand Kid."
4,Great Little Book,"Has a few photo flaws, but mostly a great little book to have. Has lots of history, current information, photos, and maps on all eight of the California Channel Islands. Also has information on boating and local mainland marinas in Southern California. It's small enough to take anywhere. Try to get the latest Edition, as many things do change!"
2,Required for MFT/3 table,"I love the Festool brand, they build really outstandingly engineered products and have no qualms about charging a premium for them. These clamps are an absolute necessity if you have an MFT/3 table and they work really well. However, unlike the rest of their power tools, which you can justify the high prices for, getting charged over $100 for a pair of simple clamps just leaves you feeling ripped off. Truth is, there is no excuse to charge this much for a simple mechanical clamp except that Festool can get away with gouging their customers because they have such a closed eco-system. I love their products, but paying this much for clamps really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. The clamps would be 5 stars if they were $40 for the pair, but at $103 for the pair - I'm being generous with a 2 star review."
4,Work Really Well but Expensive,"These things work really well with the MFT. You can get quite a bit of pressure of these. They work great for sanding, saw, etc. But if you are handplaning on edge, they aren't strong enough but this is an admittedly tough task for this set up. I've also used these on a couple of jigs. Just drill a 20mm hole and you can use these anywhere.The ideal situation would be to own 2 sets of these. There are several times I have wanted more than two of these. Unfortunately, these things are phenomenally expensive. It seems that these things sgould be about $35, $50 tops. The current price of $80 makes one feel they have been taken advantage of in a bad way."
2,cheap metal not usual Festool quality,I purchased a pair of these and loved them at first. After a week of using them they started to stick. I looked at the metal rod and it had little nicks all over it. I then checked Festools owner blog and found many others had the same problem and no answers. I returned them and saw the same set but made by by another company from Australia that makes a multipurpose table. I checked out there clamps and the shaft was made from a stronger steel it seemed. The salesman told me that the demo clamps from the other company had been used for 4 years and no problem. We then did a side by side test and the Festool clamps (2 separate sets) stuck after a little use but the other ones did not. Sorry to say but you can not buy the other company's clamps in the US without the $800 table (not yet anyways).
5,Awesome bearings.,Great bearing to buy if you want to convert your loose ball bearing on your bike to sealed bearings. Comes with everything you need and installing the new cups is simple but make sure you use a rubber hammer or you'll destroy the cups and the bearings.
5,Just what I wanted,"This carafe is inexpensive and keeps the liquid hot for at least 12 hours. The only problem was that it had scratches and little stains on the lid and the surrounding area, even though it was delivered perfectly packaged. I am guessing Amazon sent me a returned item, not properly check. Two out of three items in that order came with scratches! I am a new customer and this is very disappointing, since up to now I did not have any problems with other sellers.I am not returning it because my previous carafe (Guzzini) after six months began to leak, so I need the carafe now."
5,Love this product (and use it often),"This is great to have if you're an avid coffee drinker. You brew your pot of coffee and transfer it to the carafe - the coffee stays fresh b/c it doesn't keep ""cooking"". My mom bought me another one which is handy when you have company - you can make the coffee ahead of time and it will stay hot & fresh by the time dessert time comes around. A must-have!"
1,Don't buy this leaky carafe!,All I have to say is these carafes leak like crazy. Go ahead and splurge for an all stainless steel one. You really do get what you pay for in this instance.
3,"Well Made, Durable, But it Feels like riding a horse","I took this out and had a lot of fun on it, the only problem i found was that i could not keep my legs spread open for a long time, and riding on your knees is uncomfortable! Maybe it was made more for weman. After about ten minutes of riding, i had to get off of it and my legs were hurting. I plan on buying a laydown one instead."
2,Lasted a few months and busted...,"I bought this for a friend. He loved it, and played with it all the time. Well, a couple months of use later, the ball busted and he had to through it away and clean up the mess."
4,Great for getting my strength back,I keep this at my desk at work and when I'm reading documents on my screen I play with this all the time. I especially like it since it offers some good resistance and I recently had my wrist in a splint for 6 weeks so my hand and wrist are weaker than the other hand right now. This should help me strengthen both hands/wrists/forearms if I use it frequently. Don't know if its durable or not since I've only had it for a week but so far so good. It even bounces some which makes it more fun to play with.
2,Too much expensive,"For such a small thing, I expect it be be under three bucks. And it turned out to be small and a little uncomfortable."
2,Not what I ordered and arrived ripped,"I ordered blue and got red. Also, the cloth around the ball was ripped open when I got it exposing the gel inside. It quickly retained dust and debris from whatever surface it was on. Lastly, I am not sure if this is a con or pro but it had a weird fruity smell to it. I don't know if it is supposed too or not. Anyway, I wouldn't buy another one. I have had better."
1,My balls are bigger,"These balls are puny. Sell a larger size, I wouldn't mind paying extra. I bought several squeeze balls over the years and none were ever as small as these. The overall quality does appear good though..."
5,The simplicity,"I, for some reason, get amused really easily, so I got this ball for a stress ball, but I ended up just throwing it around the room. The quality is quite amazing and it seems durable. It didn't end up being a stress ball for me, but it did become one of those ""throw me around"" kind of object in my room."
4,great for physical therapy,"When I have needed ""hand physical therapy"" in the past, I always use an isoflex ball. I love the isoflex balls...but they break really quickly and then sand is all over the place. This appears to be a MUCH sturdier ball...I just wish it was a LITTLE squishier like the isoflex...but it is very good and stays together!"
2,"Not for ""big kids""","The texture of the fabric, and the squishy-ness of the ball are great. The problem is, with repeated use by strong hands, the gell begins to come out through the fabric seems in little tiny balls, that feel like ""pills"" on the fabric. I'd only recommend this for elementary students or people who wont squish it with much force."
5,Great if you are fidgety!,I use one of these at my desk because I am fidgety and tend to bite my nails. It has helped out a lot. The balls are not too hard to squeeze and have a decent amount of give. They seem to be high quality. The price is right too.
5,Worth it!,"I was concerned after reading a few of the other reviews, but I received my ball yesterday, and I love it so much, I bought a 2nd one today! The color I got is a deep purple, but they say in the description that COLORS MAY VARY. (To all the people complaining about how they didn't get the color they wanted). Anyway, it's very firm, but I have average size hands, and it's perfect for me. I have high anxiety, and it relieves a lot of the tension to squeeze the heck out of the ball! It has just enough ""give"" to make it feel good. I've used the other balls with beans in them, and they seem too flimsy, to me. This ball retains its shape - meaning when you squeeze it, it won't stay that way. It goes back into a ball shape. But that's ok with me, too. Another bonus is that there is NO tag on it! Just a smooth ball to squeeze! I highly recommend it!"
3,Not what I expected...,"This is not the kind of ""stress ball"" I am accustomed to. It seems more like a hackie sack with gel in the middle. The ball is covered in a satiny fabric. it is fine and may meet certain expectations but I would have like to have understood before I ordered that the covering of the ball was not the traditional silicon or rubbery material, it is it is a satiny fabric."
5,Great little ball,"First of all I got a purple one yay! (They don't even show purple on the picture, which is odd, but I'm not complaining because it's pretty). This little ball is great for me to fidget with. I'm a stay-home mom doing online college, so I spend a whole lot of time sitting at my computer. Unless I'm typing, my left hand is always restless and fidgety and I always start messing with cords or playing with my earrings or something. Okay maybe I'm just weird, but anyway this ball gives my left hand something to do so it's perfect for me.Also it's great for relieving frustration. Like when my computer is messing up, usually I get all frustrated and yell at it (yes I yell at my computer lol). Well now I've found that if I close my eyes, squeeze the ball really tight, and count to like 5 or 10, it really helps me calm down! No more yelling at inanimate objects lol! So if you get easily stressed, frustrated, or your hands get bored and fidgety, definitely get this ball."
4,It's a decent stress ball but I wish it was softer,"My wife bought four of these and they look and feel great. The problem is that these gels make the balls feel hard. I would prefer the gels actually squish between my fingers a bit. Still, these do the trick.Just another note, I bought an Waboba Extreme ball (Waboba Extreme Ball bounces on water) and learned after the fact that it's the same as these stress balls. So if you're looking for a ball that skips in the water, buy one of these since the Waboba balls costs twice as much!"
2,Too small,This squeeze ball is a child's size. I can barely squeeze it. It is so small.Get a racket ball.Pass this one by.
3,gel???,Feels more like a rock.. Maybe after a few times of squeesing it. ...It may loosen up.. But its really hard
4,straight forward and very organized,"This is a must have book for every Marilyn Monroe fan because it goes through in chronological order of Marilyn's films. It shows what critics thought of the films in the years that they came out, the songs that Marilyn sings or dances to. Along with an extensive review of each film's plot, climax,a nd characters."
2,Very weak...,"The blue LED lights this projects are very weak and difficult to read. Difficult to read, not only because of the dim illumination, but also because of the ""font"" used. I find that the red LEDs usually are brighter on these clocks."
3,A racy and compelling story,"Jennifer Jane Pope's writing is racy and the story compelling. This book is a time travel story that takes a plucky modern heroine and plunges her into the clutches of a Victorian aristocrat who is a villian of the old school. You boo and hiss him throughout the whole book. Teena Thyme is tied up, beaten, and humiliated. Despite her yearning to be free and all her valiant efforts, she remains a prisoner until ...well, I wont give away the plot. If the characters are a bit one-dimensional, they are vivid and lively, and remain in your head long after the book has finished. If I have a criticism, it is that the ending is left unfinished, leaving the reader to wait until the next volume is published until he/she finds out what happens next. That apart, it is a good read and I recommend it."
3,3 1/2 quite a bit better than average for the genre,"Nicely done erotica with some decent character development. Some BDSM, Ds and a cross-dresser. A lot of F/F action. A good read and better than most by this publisher."
5,Stunning,"I can't wait for her next album, and I'm surprised someone with a voice as heavenly and emotive as hers hasn't received more attention."
5,Works great!,"I am using two of these devices to listen to zone2 from my denon AVR. The cat5 run is only 20' long so I didn't expect any issues. One device at my denon, and one device at my amp. Works great!"
1,NOT THERE YET.........,"Despite some Middle Eastern flourishes, these drab, monotonous, neverending dance tunes/electronica would be better suited (perhaps) as low background music for some dingy opium den or (definitely) for the nearest trash bin. Look elsewhere for this kind of music; I wish I had."
4,minimises maths underlying the graphics,"Park does a skilful job of minimising the amount of maths that a newcomer to Maya needs. Or, perhaps, it is Maya that does that. Anyhow, traditional texts on graphics (think Foley and van Dam) are replete with maths. Usually matrix algebra. But also for the physics of ray tracing etc. What this book demonstrates is showing how to use Maya for many 3D graphics tasks, often without having to explicitly deal with the underlying maths. Like manipulating NURBs or single or multiple light sources. Or dealing with shading issues.As is common nowadays in graphics texts, there are several colour plates, with cartoon characters made with Maya. Impressive functionality."
5,Great for college students or people figuring out what they want to do,"What a great book! You could literally live your life with this book going from one volunteer opportunity to another. The book is basically a list of short terms jobs ranging from camps to dude ranches to museums. It tells you if they pay you anything, if they feed you, if they board you, how long the job is for, and it gives descriptions and contact info. This is an excellent all in one resources for jobs in the US so quit the desk job and travel around volunteering for a living. This will inspire you to do it!"
1,I thought this book was terrible.,"This book had hardly any action in it, exept for near the end. In every chapter, I wanted to stop reading the book. Everybody does not have the same opinion as I, so I would say that people that don't like a lot of action in books, I'd say read Cry of the Crow. If you like books with a lot of action and suspense, I'd say don't read it because you will want to stop reading it in every chapter. I, myself would give this book a poor rating."
4,Touching,"There is something so tender about this novel, kind of a ""The Yearling"" only with a girl and a crow. It's a gorgeous look at the natural world and animals, and also the look of a family."
2,Fly into adventure with the Crow,"@riannaThe age I would recommend for this book would be 10 or 11. This should be for 5th or at least 4th grade.Mandy is a little girl who lives the Piny Woods. She loves crows but her brothers and her father are trying to kill all the crows in the forest. The only crows who are still alive are the leader of the Trumpet Hammock crows, his name is Kray,and Nina Terrence, Mandy's pet crow.I found this book not that interesting. I felt like the part When Mandy gives Nina Terrence her food and she looks at Mandy with her eyes big and round."
4,This book was wonderful!,"Jean, your book was excellent! You gave so exquisite details, I could practilly picture everything you wrote about in my mind. It was very emotional. At some points I laughed and then again I whept. The style of your writing was fantastic.I wish I could write like you!!!!!!"
4,this book was great!!!! i loved it!!!!,"this book was sad , but yet funny!my favorite words that nina terrance said was ""i got youv"" and ""ha ha ha , very funny , ha ha ha "" this book would be great for people who want a novel thats funny and sad."
2,I wasn't charmed...,"I wasn't charmed by ""the Cry of the Crow"" like many other have. Although the book finds a smart way to teach us a lesson about the hidden effects of what we do in life, the story lacks fantasy, action, and adventure. Only Mandy and her crow are described in detail and the story would have been about the same without the other characters. Even Mandy and her crow's love for one another didn't jump out from the pages. I found it difficult to care for them in the end."
4,I thought the book was good.,I likethe book The cry of the Crowfor a few reasons.One reason is because it tells you something important.Also she(Jean Craighead George)writes a lot of different books that r wonderful too.If i like the book it most be good!
5,Nothing to say about the best duo born in Puerto Rico,"If you want to know how good this CD is, just buy it. All the songs are beautiful and the sound is great, since all of them were recorded in the fifties and sixties."
1,A Muddled Effort,"If you can look past the poor design and layout, the careless editing and abysmal proofreading, and the overall cheap quality of the book (including fuzzy and irrelevant photos), there is at least a little food for thought here. For a critic who is normally so concise and clear in his theatre reviews, Marowitz proves to be a rambling and unfocused sort in a longer forum. He has some interesting ideas, but they tend to get lost in the muddled and inconsistent style. Probably a must-buy for the diehard theatre enthusiast who wants to stay informed, but a much better overall treatment of the topic can be found in Richard Hornby's ""The End of Acting""."
2,"Interesting idea, but ruined by publisher","If the book was proofread before it was published, the proofreader should never be allowed to read a book again. There are an average of 3 spelling and basic grammatical mistakes on each page. The narrative suddenly switches to another character's viewpoint without even starting a new paragraph - just a new line, no extra space, no separating line.I did read it through to the end because if you ignore the above(impossible, but I tried real hard!) the story is interesting and has a couple of nice twists.My suggestion to the author for his next book is : ""A sequel would be nice, but change the publisher!"""
3,IS for Healthcare Management,"I was required to get this book for a college course, I found it terribly basic and thought the content could have been better covered with either another text or select readings."
5,not too much to add to the great reviews,"For another good cross-examination of the 36 & 24, see pg 200 of Stephen Chang's Internal Exercises. Note the hexagrams and relate them to the dantiens and you wind up with a fantastic internal dynamo. Its also the MCO.Good supplementary bit of info ;)"
2,Not the quality I am expecting from the brand,I have purchased the Yonex Aerosensa 30 before and when I received and compared this product - there was something different to the packaging and the quality of the tube and the shuttlecock. It is not the same as the original ones I get from Japan.It appears that this is made in China. The label in the tube was printed poorly (not the same as my purchases before). The label on the tube and the label inside the shuttlecocks have the logo inside and it says made in china.I will not purchase this product anymore from the supplier as these are not as good as the original ones. I feel that these are fake shuttles and think I won't spend time sending it back to the supplier. (Such a waste of time)
2,Rip off for namesake,"I bought this thinking Yonex makes good product, but after using it I feel like it that it is a fake Yonex. It breaks very fast. I have used some feather ones before but this one just breaks too fast and not that great. Spins way too much, may be thats the right birdie but bottomline I would not buy it again."
4,review for yonex aerosensa 30,"it's brand new and it does not have any defectsheavy head, nice to smach!"
1,Bad product,This is the worst shuttle i have purchased in a long time and would not recommend this to anyone. I am using up 3 shuttles per game.
1,never received,Hello there. I never did receive this product for sure. Please check if I was billed for this and charged.Thanks so much...Hal Ornstein
5,The way Up,"Didn't think he would have recorded his piece on Video but he did. This is a truly a great piece of modern music.And you get to see musicians work their craft.My only compliant is about editing. After the piece was over, The credits rolled over on black. You didn't see the players bowing or the audience giving deserved applause, just sound. EGO? or resisted EGO. Or what? I don't know. Perhaps you can come up with the reason why that choice was made."
5,Amazing!,"This is a must-have title for any fans of Pat Metheny, guitar, or simply anyone of appreciates world-class musicianshipThose lucky enough to have a receiver that can decode DTS-HD are in for a real treat. This is one of the best sounding concert DVD's that I have ever heard in my home theater.Highly recommended!"
5,Great chemistry,"I thoroughly enjoyed this great DVD and watch it as much as I can without getting sick of it from overuse. I even follow along on a Roland handsonic and a wonderful home theater.Watching and participating gives one an appreciation for these remarkable musicians and the perfomance they give here. I won't give any technical jargon, but I will give my enthusiastic thumbs up for this DVD and encourage anyone who likes progressive jazz (or even if you don't, you'll still probably like this also),to purchase and enjoy."
4,PAT METHENY GROUP - THE WAY UP LIVE,"It`s very interesting. I think it`s a PMG positive sharp break point in time. For me, listening PMG since the white albúm, the way up is a picture of several colours."
5,Pat Metheny Group - The Way Up - Live (DVD),The Best Pat Metheny Group Concert Dvd So Far? This Is so Good! Sound & Picture Excellent. If You Are A 'Pat Metheny & Lyle Mays' Fan This Is A Must Have Dvd.
4,"beautiful, but short","The performance is as perfect as you could hope for. This is a concert I'll enjoy for the rest of my life. The sound and the video production are excellent in every way possible. But for all the worthy praise you could heap on this, I'm not sure why you'd want the blu-ray instead of the DVD version. There aren't any extras and the interview at the end is dull (I couldn't finish that part). And newer DVDs are just as enjoyable with the new generation of flat screens as blu-ray. At least to me. Unless there's something more to make you want to pay a higher price for it.One more point to harp on--and I really do love this disc--is that all we get is ""The Way Up"" performance. I'm sure, from having been to several Metheny concerts, that much more went on that night than an hour's worth of music. At least provide the rest as a separate menu item if preserving the special integrity of this work was the main concern."
5,Great roaster for porkchops and fish,We eat a lot of porkchops and fish and we use this grill/roaster for cooking it. This is a great Zoji machine and it's a healthy way of cooking. Cleaning up like all electric grills and roasters is not the easiest thing to do.
5,That poor poor guy,"An excellent series and hopefully on going. Harry Dresden the only Wizard in the phone book cannot catch a break, vampires hate him, demons are after him, his fellow wizards would rather see him get killed then deal with his maverick (but moral) attitudes, and to top it all his only friend is a knight of god who wont shut up about all the swearing!!"
2,An amazing novel,"This was by far the worst book of the series. After I finished it, I decided that I was not going to continue the series; I was done. I am glad that I changed my mind, because books 7 and 8 were fantastic, Blood Rites was below average. As in all of his novels, Butcher creates great character depth. Additionally, the overall plot (the war with the Red Court, the drama with the White Council, the Nevernever, his involvement with the fairies) progresses in this novel. However, the fact that he uses the set of a porn film for this book was a little over the top. I have problems believing that this is where supernatural beings would wage battle. This novel can't be skipped because of its importance to the series, but I wish it could be."
5,Monkey poo. On fire.,"A very good read; it's a fast paced page turner of a magical thriller and has some of the funniest moments I've read in a long time.It's got magic, vampires, prostitutes and flaming monkey-demon poo. What more could you want?"
5,This author will hold you spell bound!,"These books are great! If you love science fiction you will love these books. The author is funny, witty and holds your interest from cover to cover. I ordered the complete set and read through it in a week! I hope they bring the television series back to SciFi. It is more entertaining a series that SciFi brought back, Dr. Who, or as I call it ""the doctor's non habit forming sleep remedy""! I'm going to reread them soon since I enjoyed them so much! I'm sure there were things I missed on the first go around. I'm also looking forward to the next book in the series."
5,I love Harry!,"Oh dear me, Harry Dresden has really grown on me. This book is one of the better ones in the series so far, in my opinion. The details you learn about characters like Harry, Thomas the vampire, and Karrin Murphy make them more real. Bonds are formed in this book, you start feeling even stronger ties with the characters.Then there's the plot itself, which is pretty exciting up until the last chapter. Lots of near-misses keep you on your toes. It was exciting to have the dual plots: fighting the vampires and finding out who's cursing Arturo Genosa. Great action and effortless description by Butcher, as always.I always feel like I'm sitting with Harry at the bar, and he's telling me these outrageous stories over a few beers. I love Butcher's conversational writing style, it's perfect for this series."
4,Moving forward,"Not the best in the series so far, menaing it's still a great book! I really like that the series is moving forward and that the characters develop. And also, Harry is an amazing character, it's worth reading for his witty and rude comments in the face of death alone!"
5,The series has reached its potential - best so far!,"This is the funniest, and at the same time, the most thoughtful book of the series so far. Dresden naively investigates what he believes is a mainstream film maker, who believes he is the target of a mysterious curse. It turns out he is an adult film director, as Harry discovers upon arriving at a set. There are many moments of effective humor, and also some effective deeper moments. We learn more about some familiar characters, including (finally) Harry. The surprises are excellent, and the character interactions are superb. There is still plenty of action, but it takes a back seat to the real strength of this one, which is the story. All of these books have been entertaining, and I've been waiting to see if one of them was going to go a little further, and soar. This one did!"
2,Crappy,"I couldn't get through my first Dresden novel. I made it about 120 pages and realized it wasn't worth continuing. How anyone can enjoy reading about this buffoon is beyond me. The humor is on the level of the Police Academy movies (and not the first one, the only good one) and the plot unfolds at a snail's pace. Butcher should be forced to read Raymond Carver so he can learn how a detective novel should be written. I gave the novel an extra star because the idea of porno vampires is titillating. Too bad Butcher couldn't match the quality of his prose with originality of the premise."
5,"Excellent book, but a true tragedy","This is a very fine book that is among the most understandable discussions of regression and path analysis that I have ever seen. Sadly the author is dead, the press is defunct, and the owner of the press has passed away as well. I actually tried to secure permission to get this book published as a PDF on the web, but I do not know who to ask, and apparently it will not be in the public domain for a long time. Truly tragic.If you can get your hands on this book it is an excellent treatise on the logic of regression and correlation, and gives a very intuitive and hands on discussion of path analysis, a statistical method that is not used nearly enough."
5,Basketry is fun,This is an excellent book. It gives detailed instructions for beginners and lists all the supplies needed. Then it also has instructions for more intermediate and unusually designed baskets.
5,A Great Starter Book,"A top-notch book for beginners, and a great inspiration for those who have already mastered the basics. If you're a beginner, the clear instructions, line drawings, and excellent photography will help you out immensely. The book begins with a simple project, with step-by-step instructions that are easy to follow. You'll be so proud of your results, you'll want to continue, and the book won't let you down on providing finer points on stitching, shaping, center variations, etc. The photos of superb baskets, especially those by Lee Sipe, show you what master artisans can do with the basic techniques. Highly recommended."
5,Pine Needle Basketry From Forest Floor to Finished Product,This book has the best instructions. From Pictures to easy to understand written directions. I have done two baskets with lids. Great for anyone who wants to try.
5,craftgirl,I guess I liked this book a lot . Have purchased it twice. One was a gift. With all the pine needles around the country just think of it as recycling A great book that covers all phases of pine needles. It is like a class.
4,A solid step for global markets,The book gives to the reader all basic information to start to think in Global Terms. All steps to face the new markets are presented in a objective view. Even if you work in a local company the book can make you think about threats which may come from abroad.
4,Flying Goose Decoy,"I had my reservations about this decoy initially but after using it for a couple of seasons I have come to really like it over some others that I have. The full body is well made and the spring mount works very well. It, like other full body designs, is a little bulky to transport but that is something you give up with this type of design. I give it a thumbs up for full body decoys."
2,Not what I expected,"Although it often seems a bit unfair to rate a book lower based on my expectations, that's where I'm going with this. I think my expectations might be similar to yours.I expected this book to have healthy, mostly vegetarian recipes, so I was surprised that so many, many of them were for meat dishes. I couldn't use the book, so I passed it on to someone else immediately.Many of the recipes also use a very small amount of ground apricot kernels sprinkled onto an otherwise ordinary dish, which doesn't seem like enough to qualify the dish as rich in B17.I'd suggest learning which foods have B17, and doing a computer search for recipes for them."
3,The author of this book was hospitalized and fell into a coma from cyanide poisoning from eating 25 apricot pits with honey,"Please be careful. Cyanide can kill you. I'm not saying it couldn't be helpful; I don't know that it doesn't prevent or cure cancer. Certainly it can be deadly, though.According to an article in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition called ""Laterile: the Cult of Cyanide"" by author Victor Herbert, this author was hospitalized and fell into a coma from consuming 25 crushed apricot pits with honey. She almost died. You can die from cyanide poisoning from common foods. Here's the article, which I didn't include initially, which was silly of me. [...]"
5,now now veggies,"the thing with not eating meat is that you really do miss some vital nutrients. it doesn't mean you have to walk around with a slab of bloody beef at all times, but fish (salmon?) and poultry are needed, if even in small quantities.funny thing is, vegetarians take b-12 to make up for the lack of such through a non-meat diet. thing is, i was reading that these forms of b-12 don't absorb the natural way, if anything, it's actually worse than eating meat, as it blocks the b-12 from getting through.effects of lack of b-12 can be neurological problems (i seriously read that) as well as depression...."
2,amateur hour,"For the first time ever with my many purchases on Amazon, I'm going to look into a return. I'm a huge Waits fan but this disc doesn't honor Tom at all. Very, very average covers but various artists that my be good on their own but not great when singing Tom's tunes. Don't bother..."
2,Stick to the real thing,"This album - which I don't own, and never will - underlines the simple fact that Tom Waits covers never improve on the original. So why bother? I spent an evening at a friend's house listening to it, and found it pleasant enough but really not worth having. Spend the money on Frank's Wild Years, Swordfishtrombones or Bone Machine."
2,A SAD TWCD,I like Tom Waits most of the time. It was hard for me to listen to all of this album. This is one I will probably give away or resell if I need some cash. I hope I can find a buyer for it soon.
5,An Explosion of Passion,"I first heard ""Play Dead"" while I was watching a video compilation of Bjork. I was not aware of this song and itimmediately engulfed me like ahurricane. Bjork's stratospheric vocals and thepassionate yet haunting musicwhich accompanied it was an overwhelming display of emotion and conviction.This whenli Young AmericansI first heard ""Play Dead while I was watching a video compilation of Bjork. I was not aware of this song and itimmediately"
5,WHo was it that said techno singers could be emotional,"For those of you who had ever thought of Bjork as only a buch of bleeps and screams this song is very powerful, and stays with you a long time. It has an powerful feel to it, and the strings with Bjork's Bjorkish voice altogether make the song todally awesome. Buy THis!!!"
2,= so-so,"This song was very popular on the UK charts in 1993 for a season. But despite PLAY DEAD's good lyrics and production, I don't really care very much for the song compared to most of Björk's work. It lingers 'round the bottom of the Björk totem pole in my book. ""Darling, stop confusing me with your wishful thinking, hopeful embraces ... don't you understand?"" Very nice lyrics, though. The song drags a lot, and its very ""orchestral"" nature seems to try and dress up a basic and predictable ballad. Oh, but she croons it with all she's got! Perhaps the melodrama is its biggest flaw."
5,"Standard issue, as advertized, no supprises","Direct drop-in replacement to the OEM radiator cap for my 2007 Honda Element. Fits any Element of any year. Very well built, sturdy rubber seal, nothing fancy to break. Other people recommended this exact part to me, and I recommend it to you."
1,Cheap Plastic ferrule,"The ferrule (the piece that joins the two sections) is cheap plastic...it won't last long!! It will start wobbling and may even break if you are a strong paddler. This is a shame since the older version of this paddle was great...the best on the market for the money...now I rate it less than the average paddle for this price range...even just plain CHEAP. Go ahead and spend a few more bucks and get something else that won't leave you stranded on the water. It would be nice if they would go back to the good quality they used to put into this product, even if it costs a little more. [...]"
5,"Great paddles, solid built!","Very solid built. I'm 5' 9"", using this 240mm initial thought would be too long for paddling on my new inflatable kayak. However after couple of tries and adjustment on my part, it seem a breeze to paddle. Given the kayak has a slightly up-slanted haul and doesn't cut water as the hard shell. Nonetheless the paddles felt very solid and responsive."
4,"Angela, True Diva","Gheorghiu is one of the finest sopranos singing today. This is not her best work, but it is still better than what most singers are turning out."
2,Diva,"Excellent singing, but the aria selection should have been more appropriate to her voice. Particularly the french arias were boring and didn't show off her talent."
3,Diva???,"I'll be brutally honest. I only got this album because I was curious and wanted to see if Gheorghiu had improved at all from her other albums. Yes, she has. She has much more flexibility and range. However, her voice is still far to covered and it sound to me like she has some tension going on. It sounds to me as if she's trying too hard to sound like Maria Callas. Callas is Callas and Gheorghiu is Gheorghiu. They are different people and should sound as such.Go with a Fleming album in stead. She has recorded most of these songs as well, and in addition these songs are the songs that every soprano records at one point or another in their career."
4,A BIt Uneven - but great bits make it worthwhile,"We are now through the first 3 seasons and partway into the 4th season. There is some pure gold in this set - the entire family is enjoying it. On the other hand, there are a fair amount of clinkers too - the shows are hit or miss. If you are sensitive to off-color language this set is ABSOLUTELY NOT for you. Many of the best skits are available on YouTube, though the video quality is certainly substandard by comparison. All-in-all, this was a good addition to our home library, though if I had to choose between this collection and the Complete Jeeves & Wooster - Jeeves would win hands down!"
3,A Bit of Fry and Laurie,"Gets better as it goes along, but many of the jokes and skits are, I think, parodies of British TV shows that we don't get--so, though I think they're both wonderful, Jeeves & Wooster was SO much better."
1,totally unhappy with this product,"I bought this so that I could relax with laughs at the end of a working day. The DVDs are unwatchable. The canned laughter is about 5 times as loud as the spoken words. I turned the sound down so low that I could hardly hear the words, but the canned laughter was still so loud that it was painful. My blood pressure raised so high I had to throw the DVDs out. I only got half way through the first one. Unhappy."
2,Jeeves & Wooster It Isn't,"For those used to the brilliant writing of either Jeeves & Wooster or House M.D., this series will be a serious disappointment. Though sometimes genuinely funny, it sadly relies on profanity and sexual humor far too much of the time."
1,Wake me up when it's over,"Fortunately I got this through the library. I wouldn't pay for it. It's dated rehash of a lot of the bad Monty-Python sketch acts...the worst ones...and I love MP. Seriously, half of the jokes were DIRECTLY taken from Monty Python routines, or even Benny Hill, but done quite poorly. Maybe if you were back in that time period, and hadn't seen anything Python, you may have gotten a laugh out of it. Now, the humor seems overly stale, forced, and is just bad. I couldn't make it through the first episode without wanting to burn my library card. Now...that all said, I like watching House...but if you're looking for any of that acting skill in this, forget about it. Again...this takes the most predictable path to every joke or comic scene. I was bored stiff and found it simply boring as he11. So...for those who don't find this review helpful, go buy it and see for yourself what a steaming pile this thing really is, then come back and put your own review in."
5,Bit of Fry & Laurie,This DVD set was a gift for my nephew. He absolutey loved it. He and his friends have watched it over and over. He loves British humor. The delivery time was faster than quoted.
4,A Bit or Fry and Laurie,"It is refreshing to see Laurie showing his skills beyond those displayed on ""House"". He is a very talented actor and has a wonderful sense of humor. These pieces are a fine choice for someone housebound as you can laugh at your own pace."
3,More Than A Bit Funny,"If you like British humor, this pair does a wonderful job of keeping you laughing. I still find it hard to believe that Hugh Laurie can be the harse Dr. House on American TV when he came from such comical beginnings. Enjoy."
3,What!!!!!!!,Its ok i guess. i was thinkig a first this stuff would be like a flock of seagulls or kajagoogoo. its a lot better then those guys. pretty good new wave syth-pop
1,AWFUL!!!,"This dvd is completely worthless. I was hoping to see lots of hot topless college age girls on the beach. But this dvd has nothing but old women- most clearly over 40 yrs old. YUCK!! They even have the nerve of showing grandma aged women like 70yrs old!! Very sickening. Anyway, be warned about this video if you are looking for hot chicks it doesn't happen here. They are either fat, ugly, or over 40 yrs old. Some of the ""Girls Going Crazy"" dvd's are actaully really good and show some hot babes. But the nude beach series is horrible!!!"
2,REPEATITIVE NONSENSE,"The title says, ""From ground up"", but, in actuality, it's from ""C up"". It's not very descriptive at all, nor are the chapters categorized according to effective learning. I stopped reading it after the first few chapters; time is of essense. It had too many theories and not enough fact. If you're an absolute beginner, like I was, try ""Learn C++ in just 21 days"", by Jesse Liberty. That book clearly introduces the basics, and defines the terms of, the C++ language, outside of the Windows environment."
4,"Good book for developer wannabes, Terrible title","The Amazon summary is accurate-this book is not for total newbies, not from the ""Ground Up."" It is for people that have done a fair amount of console application practice and danced around with the MSVC++5 developer (""VC++5 in 21 Days""). At this point, I was saying ""OK why did I do this?"" and bought ""Ground Up"" because it was cheap. It was a pleasant surprise. It gives a good overview of several important aspects of software development using MSVC++5, including database design with a comparison of the different MS tools, Internet applications and HTML, security issues, and polishing up shareware or commercial apps. So if someone is learning VC++5 and intends to do more than point and click ""programming"" but lacks commercial development experience, this is an excellent stepping stone."
2,REPEATITIVE NONSENSE,"The title says, ""From ground up"", but, in actuality, it's from ""C up"". It's not very descriptive at all, and the chapters aren't categorized according to effective learning. I stopped reading it after the first few chapters; time is of essense. It had too many theories and not enough fact. If you're an absolute beginner, like I was, try ""Learn C++ in just 21 days"", by Jesse Liberty; that book clearly introduces the basics, and defines the terms of, the C++ language, outside of the Windows environment."
2,Try to cover everything & end up covering nothing,Good overview of Visual C++ and all the general topics it can apply too. But I really just wanted more details concerning SDI & MDI Desktop Applications programming with MFC.
1,Buy something else. Do not buy this book!,"It is just packed with errors and creates much confusion. The first sample program is Console.exe. You are told to select File/New/Win32 Console/OK. You are then told it is ""Now time to add some code to our example"" but no clue as to where to put it. No reference to creating a text file, saving it as console.cpp and then adding it to our application. Why is the parameter in the CDrawBox DoDraw prototype called String and called cValue in the body of the same function? This is not the book to use to learn anything about C++."
3,kinda boring,"this one I could only do once. It seems kinda boring.....the moves are repeatful and it doesn't provide enough of a challenge. The woman is fun though, very upbeat and encouraging. I wouldn't buy it."
2,"So So, and somewhat irritating","I bought this DVD to add variety to my regular workouts. I do at least 6 mies per day and love walking as it is effective and easy on my joints. The title of this DVD is certainly intriguing and who does not want a flat belly? I realize it is connected to a book and diet, both of which I have read and think just using common sense and eating healthy will accomplish the same thing. However, back to the DVD. It was easy to do, but I found it somewhat irritating. It seems just as you get going you have to stop and do intervals of specific ""belly"" exercises. I would have preferred to continue with the aerobic portion, then do the other targeted exercises. It was pretty short too so I did it twice...twice the irritation."
5,Ellen Rocks,I really liked this walking DVD. It was fun. It had a couple of moments during the last set I got bored but all in all it really worked your body.
5,Works for me,"I have used lots of tapes (started with casette tapes way back when), CDs, and DVDs for exercising. This one is nicely paced, contains additional information should you want it and acceptable music. It's a nice accompaniment to the book which I have also. Lost nine pounds and still going!"
3,Change of Pace,"This is an okay workout and a nice change of pace. This instructor is not quite as stiff as Freytag, but still a bit too bouncy with her unnatural walking moves. The bonus workout at the end is worth the purchase on it's own. You should be able to complete the 8 minute toning on your first try and really feel the results. The walk workout crosses the line and has just a few too many fancy dance steps, but if you can get through that five minutes, it's worth the effort. This is the first Prevention workout that I have purchased that is actually worth keeping in my collection."
3,Steady Consistent-Paced Workout,"I like this DVD. It has enough variety to be interesting, but it's not face-paced, so if you want a workout that will get your heart really pumping and have you sweating, this is not for you. I think it's a good workout for someone between the ages of 40-60 - one that you can do every night."
1,Really Rates Zero Stars,"Normally, I dont review books I havent fully read. I make an exception for this one. I picked this garbage up at a book store and flipped through it a little. I came across a passage where the author tried to justify Clinton's draft dodging ways by stating that Clinton wanted to be President and most Presidents with military service backgrounds served in the Navy. This of course begs the question of why Clinton didnt join the Navy. Knowing this , or any other tough question would never be answered, I put the book down.I did read the bio of Mr. Walker on the jacket cover too. He is far from non-partisan as other reviewers describe. He attended Oxford with Clinton and his background screams Socialist.I see this book is out of print. A wise decision there!"
4,great,well i honestly can't remeber how my son enjoyed these because they where so long ago when i brought them nor can i remeber what i paid but as always if they came from amazon i got a good deal
2,i cant think of 1 who cares it not importent,"test u cant do a ""Big Boot"" or a ""Pump-handle Slam"" u can berrlie move them theri just plain boring scott ok u can do a ""Siener Recliner"" or a ""belly-2-Belly Suplex"" cause u cant move them plz do not by this its just a waist of mony"
4,Putting Morals to the Test,"The Scarlet Letter puts even the most morally secure people's beliefs to the test. The line between what is really sin and what is ""different"" in this novel is one that most cannot define at the end of finishing this book. It makes the reader think about the choices in their own life, and the choices they would make in situations such as those of Hester Prynne, Dimmsdale, and little Pearl. The Scarlet Letter has a wonderful way of depicting the exclusiveness of the early Puritans that is not outwardly horrible, but chips away at the patience of the reader until their feelings towards the Puritans are nothing but distain. The novel uses light and dark in ways that subconsciously show what is Godly and reverent and what is evil and sin. So many elements in The Scarlet Letter just capture the reader into wanting more, and I recommend this book to anyone who wants to challenge their beliefs."
2,"Good, but not a great classic...","Well, I read this in my Intro to Lit class. It was right after Frankenstein, so perhaps that made me like the book more than I normally would. Or maybe it was just Hawthorne's writing style. He tells us the story of Hester, a woman forced to wear the scarlet A for adultery in early Puritan America. How did they know she committed adultery? Her husband had not yet joined her in America and suddenly, she's pregnant. She refuses to reveal the father of her child. For the next couple of years we follow Hester, her daughter Pearl as she grows up isolated, and Pearl's father as well as Hester's newly returned husband...who has a new identity. Sometimes Hawthorne got so descriptive he went off-track, but for the most part, it's quite an interesting, almost soap opera storyline."
5,A Christian Feminist Classic,"Jones' book offers a re-mapping of traditional (Reformed) Christian concepts (justification and sanctification, sin, church) in light of contemporary feminist analyses of women's experience. She's faithful to both the Christian tradition and contemporary feminist thought, writes in an accessible style without talking down to the reader, and keeps things moving at a lively pace. You'll like this book if you're a feminist interested in traditional faiths, a Christian interested in feminism, or a feminist Christian trying to figure out how the two fit together."
5,Not for the faint of heart.,This book is brilliantly done and provocative. It makes you think about what is going on around you and helps search for a deeper meaning of truth in your life. Could be years before I fully understand it.
4,"In the context of his other work, sadly revealing ...","I'd have to say SR has allot to say about this subject that is true and prescient. Indeed nihlism in our time has spawned a cruel age so here I'd like to quote L. Trilling:""It is possible that the contemplation of cruelty will not make us humane but cruel; that the reiteration of the badness of our spiritual condition will make us consent to it.""I use this quote because many of Seraphim Rose's books are bizarre; in part some would say fabrications others would say delusional. Many make a carreer consenting to "" the badness of our spiritual condition"" while swaythed in robes of self sanctity and delusion, in the context of his other works one has to be ever vigilant of this type of ""spirituality""! I admire the struggle of this man but ... and will leave it at that."
3,rangebooster,It provided better reception but was not enough for the area.We still had to install an additional wireless router for good reception.
4,"Almost As Good As ""Taken""","This movie was great. I watched it on an airplane, and if a movie is good on an airplane then that means it is really good. This movie is second only to Taken as far as Liam Neeson movies are concerned."
4,Great movie. I don't usually get caught by supprise.,This one got me hook line and sinker. The ending was a surprise. I'm a fan or Liam's. In book form this would be called a pager turner. As in devouring the book not just reading it. I watched it a second time to see if I missed anything.
4,Not Bad...But Frustrating,"If you had something that important would you let someone else handled it instead? The beginning was odd but I must confess it grabs you and keeps you hanging on. The ending is weak and leaves you hanging. Not bad, but frustrating.On a side note: Would an assasin use a cheap knife? I guess so. In the fight scene I thought that knife looked familiar. I have the exact same knife. $3.00 on sale at Big 5! LOL!"
2,Why was this movie made?,Unknown. Why did it make money? Unknown. Who approved such a terrible script? Unknown. Will January Jones ever learn how to act? Unknown. Is Hitchcock laughing from the great beyond at this mediocre knock-off of his style of films? YES!
2,Dr. Martin Harris awakes . . . I fell asleep,"I rented this movie for $1.99, thinking it was a bargain. Honestly, it was a dollar too much. The plot was predictable and stale. It is a resurrection of many action movies we have seen before. I could honestly sit down and put together the puzzle by making correlations between this movie's scenes and other films I have already watched. I fell asleep before it ended and next morning asked my husband if it was good and he told me I had missed nothing, and the plot's ending was actually what I thought would happen. Truly disappointing film, led by an actor whose previous work I have admired."
4,Sher's Review !,I liked this movie because its all about idenity theft & how people can steal everything from you in a clic of a button !!
3,an older version of Bourne Identity,I have to say I really expected more out of this movie as it had a good cast. It really reminded me alot of Bourne Identity except a much older agent. I did like the fact that it took awhile for the truth to come out so a bit suspenseful in a good way. I am glad I rented it instead of seeing it in the theater. It certainly could have been worse. It did have some good car chase scenes. And I love the cast just not sure they all did their best.
1,"Horrible, weak movie","The plot is thin, the twists are trivial and action is nearly non-existent. I strongly recommend Liam Neeson's ""Taken"" -- a much more thrilling, exciting and well executed movie."
2,It's been done before and much better,"This is a decent popcorn flick, but the story has been told before much more skillfully. The story is composed of the first 15 minutes ofThe Bourne Identity (Single-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)with a hint ofShutter Island [Blu-ray]. In order to make this movie stand on it's own, it needed another twist. Without it, it's a predicable action romp with its only saving grace being Liam Neeson in the starring role. You'll likely know how the story will play out within the first few minutes and, unfortunately, the action has all been seen before with higher production values. Caring about the characters can turn a predictable plot into something special, but the character development in this is pretty weak. All that said, its a decent movie to rent on a boring Sunday afternoon."
2,UNKNOWN,"This movie revolves around CORN...yes, corn, the kind you eat...like a can of corn nibblets there are many nibblets to fork your way through this film of intrigue...acting is good, but like cow corn...tough at times to figure what this film is all about???? However it is entertaining, best viewed when eating fresh corn-on-the cob or better yet...HOT BUTTERED POPCORN!...and a little understanding of German...Actually a fun movie! BUT STILL TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT???? LIAM ON THE DVD COVER LOOKS SO CONCERNED..how concerned can you get about corn?...maybe he was a farmer before he became a man of mystery?"
1,Another liberal movie. Getting Old people!,"Another liberal movie with some weak intrigue to keep you dazed. I mean come on, your not even coming up with original stories to cover up your liberal agenda anymore! Demonizing the free market and glorifying Progressivism. Ya Ya capitalism is full of greed and has done nothing for the world, and progressivism has zero to do with usurping freedom, but only feeding the starving children. The Arabian Prince philanthropist who's only thought is ""of the children"" cracks me up! And of course his harem of concubines is for making more children and feeding them corn OF COURSE! WHY NOT. Lets just get as twisted as we can!This blatant hate of America in movies, is so beat. I could write this exact review for numerous new flicks. And I think I will. Wake up people!! Freedom is NOT the enemy. And if you think it is.... You will have the blood of Patriots and Tyrants on YOUR hands."
4,Ending with a Twist,"Seems at first like a fairly predictable, if unfathomable, situation where a guy's identity is stolen and someone is pretending to be him. For what purpose, we cannot figure out. The story moves along at a good clip, is well-acted and the ending a surprise. I like Liam Neeson, and would pretty much watch him tie his shoes, so that was a plus, too. Still an ""action hero""! A couple of hours well-spent."
5,WOW!,"What a great mystery! I came across it by accident and I love Liam Neeson so I figured why not. WOW. Great movie, great suspense and what a plot twist."
4,good movie,the movie is what I expected from Liam neeson. I enjoy all of his films. I wish that is was longer.
3,Just OK,"After seeing Liam Neeson in ""Taken"" I thought this movie would be as good. It was an entertaining flick with a good plot. The directing pace thru the first hour of the movie drags. The last half hour the pace picks up, the viewers questions are answered and the movie finishes well. Neeson's acting as always is good but during the first portion of the story, he seems just as perplexed as the audience. Once the plot is revealed his character turns from a timid personality into James Bond."
4,A Nice Thriller!,"I enjoyed this one. No this isn't Taken, but it was still very good. The blu ray looks fantastic as well. I am a big fan of Liam in any movie and this does not dissapoint."
3,Interesting film set in Berlin,"Interesting film starring Liam Neeson. While the premise is not new, the story is engrossing and the Berlin background is wonderful."
5,Good Action Thriller Movie,A good movie- we enjoyed it. Action - Thrill - Suspense - def. keeps you guessing the entire movie. We enjoyed & recommend.
3,Unknown,"I bought this movie because i like action. It not one of the better movies done by Liam Nelson but its okay. Actually, he has done better. I won't recommend this movie; its up to you. I'm just saying its okay and not great; its average."
1,Unknown..Wants to a bourne film..,"This was at total disappointment. Liam Neeson, a wonderful actor but this will leave you feeling like you wasted 2 hours ...a total skip, other reviews give the plot, but just skip it ."
3,Ok if You Haven't Seen Bourne,"This movie (like Safe House and some others) are ok if you haven't already watched the Bourne trilogy. These movies seem to be spin-offs of the Bourne trilogy and just have a feel of a cheap knock-off. If I hadn't watched the Bourne trilogy, I probably could have rated it higher, maybe.What I didn't like was that almost all the flashback scenes are ""steamy"". Really? That's all the character can or would flashback to? Those are the most important ""memories"" ?? Laughably, but at the same time disappointingly, stupid. Just dumb and an example of more of the same - gratuitous, useless sexuality. At least it wasn't fully explicit or overly frequent (still disappointing)."
3,"solid movie, but plot develops a little too slowly",a big liam neeson fan. loved him in the grey and taken--but this movie is not as good as those two. the movie is longer than it needs to be and the plot is interesting--but it takes a little too long to get to the climax. movie is very similar to the bourne series--international thriller type plot.
4,A good movie IF?,A good movie. If you look to hard you will see the plot early but still enjoyable too watch. The movie gives you enough entertainment value.
4,My wife and I enjoyed it.,"This was a good movie. We both love Liam's acting. The plot had us guessing til the end. My wife usually guesses things in movies and she guessed wrong on what was going on and I had no clue either. It was a great twist. The only complaint we had was that the movie dragged in a few places. The stunt driving was great! The actors all did an excellent job! The music in the movie was very very well done! My wife really liked the music in the club scene by New Order. If you are fan of Taken, you will like this , but just remember it takes a while for Liam to get riled up and turn into a butt kicker~! lol"
5,Unknown - DVD Rental,"THis was a fantastic movie. You were off on a different tangent when BINGO they changed to whole outcome and you couldn't see it happening until you were well into watching it happen before your eyes. Wow, that was exciting and a great thriller!If you like thrillers, spy-movies, plots that you have to follow to find out where you've been and where you are going, this is the movie for you.Recommend it highly. We have always enjoyed movies that Liam Neeson is starring in. He is really a good actor. I liked the previous one that he starred in where he goes after his kidnapped daughter. That was intense as well.I hope he will venture into other areas like romance, drama, etc. He will do well in anything he tries."
3,A HIT OR MISS INTRIGUE PIECE,"Based on a 2003 French novel. The quality of the main actors and actresses pumps it up but the story is derivative and while the overall concept is somewhat intriguing the payoff just doesn't, well, pay off. The pacing on the other hand is well done so it becomes hit or miss when we are speaking of the plot and packing. The former Statis German detective is the best supporting character. I'd say the first half is more intriguing than the latter half. January Jones plays her usual cold b**ch role which is beginning to make me feel it's the only role that she can do. This film cost roughly $40M and yielded over #134M at the Box Office. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; PLOTTING/STORY: B minus;ACTION/INTRIGUE SEQUENCES: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday."
4,Unknown let's you guessing till the end,"Pretty munch in the same line as ""Taken"". Although could use some editing to enhance the flow. Fast moving and letting you guess til the end. I would highY recommend it if you are a neesam fan"
4,Intense Thriller...Will Keep You Guessing Until The End.,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.This film with Liam Neeson (his second action film after Taken) is really intriguing from beginning to end. It keeps you guessing. Terrific performances from Oskar Schindler and Helen Of Troy. I recommend this film. Unfortunately, God's name is profaned, hence I deducted one star. Rated PG-13."
1,no movie in case,Ordered from amazon. package arrived as usual with shrink wrap intact. no discs inside. unbelievable. No movies and a crinkled up digital copy page inside.
2,Not just unknown - UNBELIEVABLE,"We pitched it after 10 minutes. Loved the previous movie - Taken. It was both exciting and believable, but the setup on in this script was just unbelievable. If you have been married for some time you can recognize your wife, and she is not going to deny knowing you. You would also know if she had an evil twin sister. It was simply unacceptable."
1,Expected more,"I loved the movie Taken and heard this was more of the same. However, I was totally disappointed in the progression of this movie. It was so slow which just killed me. It was also so disjointed that you have to fill in gaps in the plot with your own theories. Also most of the worthy but scarce action scenes are at the end of the movie. It's an okay rental but please don't buy. Like I said, I expected too much and got so little."
2,Bad execution,"The story lined had the necessary ingredients to be good, but it was very poorly executed. Go watch The Grey instead."
2,Was disappointed,"I was really looking forward to a good action movie with Liam Neeson, I really enjoyed him in Batman, and was let very disappointed after watching Unknown. Terrible story line, no plot, bad acting, bad ending."
3,Another unbelievable chase needed?,"Why do directors feel they need to include chase scenes that are so rdiculous? EVEN THE LONGEST ""PURSUITS"" LIVE ON TV DON""T COME CLOSE.i suppose it's the moviegoers who directors think want them? In real life 2 blocks plus maybe a longer freeway chase is plausible-but block after block and they walk away? Please.BTW January Jones part was was well done: underplayed and believable.Ganz and Langella excellent though I don't understand why Ganz had to take cyanide. Anyone?"
4,Great movie!,Very suspensful. Good story and fine acting. Worked for me. Most of the films Liam Neeson is in I find enjoyable. See it!
5,Keep making movies where Liam Neeson is awesome!!!,This movie was fantastic. Leaves you wondering what's going on without complicating the plot on is way to an easy to follow outcome. Too many movie have a reveal that just makes you wonder how and why you got there. Not Unknown. Loved it. Some of the flashbacks were a little to graphic without really adding anything.
3,Both Unlikelely and Predictable -,"'Unknown's' plot involves a series of unlikely deviations from an implausible (overly complex) assassination plot aimed at giving seed companies patent control over a professor's newly developed version of genetically-modified corn. Yet, even within this unlikely/implausible setting, viewers immediately also sense the eventual separation of Neeson from his 'wife,' and joining forces with the female cab driver that saved his life in the beginning scenes. Overall, the film is tolerable, but sometimes irritating because of its implausibility and complexity."
2,Bourne w/o brains,"Just how did the hero learn to drive like that? How did the bad guys find the taxi driver's apartment? Our hero lacks self awareness even with the knock on the head. Bourne knew he was trained, this guy is shallow. Disappointing."
3,Not as good as Taken,"Superb plot twist but dragged down by some mundane acting.Bruno Ganz was given a superbly understated character with an intriguing history to fill out, then hardly any function in driving the story forward. Even the results of his own investigation aren't seen to fruition, as would be the case from a man who knows his fate.Worth renting."
2,UNKNOWN - known plot,"It was claimed - kicks even more butt in UNKNOWN - but it is an exact opposite, where the hero gets his butt kicked most of the time.Expect thrills, suspense and spy-mystery - NOT action pack. Although I appreciate the story, the marketing of this movie is misleading and out of scope.Appearance and acting of Bruno Ganz as retired spy-turn-private investigator Ernst Jurgen is absolute joy to watch.The car-chase scenes are all too familiar (especially in Europe locations) and in my opinion, way too long.In summary, do not expect a ""TAKEN"" action rush movie and you will enjoy this typical spy-thriller show."
4,Nice twist,Interesting story line...Liam Neeson had a great performance as always...support acting was good and believable. It was a good action movie. Worth seeing
3,Too many fake car chases!!,It was the typical thriller. It did have a surprise ending though. Some of the movie was pretty dumb. Good acting though
4,Movie to Watch,"Just looking at the cover you would not guest that this was a good movie, good plot and very entertaining. I really enjoyed it. Liam Neeson is really good in this movie as is the entire cast. It keep you guesting but entertained."
5,Great movie!!,I love Liam Neeson and anything he acts in but I have to say that this was one of his best movies yet ...
1,A stupid movie that wasted my precious time,"Big Liam Neeson fan here, but this movie is below stupid. Based on a French novel that's probably much better, the film follows a professional assassin who, after a car accident, forgets his true identity and believes he is his cover identity, an agricultural biologist. Along the way he meets a displaced Bosnian illegal immigrant who shows some incredible fist-fighting skills (and who just seems too German to be Bosnian), and his real boss who turns out to be a gentle gentleman. And of course, the ""bad guys"" never kill the protagonist without a long speech and, therefore, a chance to get killed first. The last 30 minutes are especially pathetic. It's also a pity that handsome German actor is never put to good use."
2,2 1/2 to 3 stars tops - absolutely nothing special,"I thought this movie was just ""okay"" - in other words if you don't see it, you aren't missing anything.It was basically annoying that they couldn't come up with proof/confirmation after his identity had been stolen -- its explained later but it didn't make the annoyance any less annoying. Totally not a new story line.There was absolutely nothing new about this script - its basic cookie cutter stuff. No great lines, no great acting, no great stunts, no surprises, no value -- just more of the same old stuff.PS: Liam (if you ever read this), you did the best you could with this, it's not your fault. You just didn't have much to work with."
3,"Exciting, but flawed","A man visiting Berlin for a conference is in an auto accident, and suddenly his wife doesn't know him, and another man has stolen his identity. The film has quite a bit of excitement in it, but a significant plot hole. The story line is a bit ludicrous, but the presence of Liam Neeson elevates the film. His depth as an actor brings nuance to a role that could have been an outrageous action hero. The story takes an interesting turn toward the end that explains the confusion of the protagonist. A modest recommendation for a movie that provides a little harmless popcorn fun."
4,For Liam Neeson fans - but not as good as Taken,This is a pretty tight film that was enjoyable throughout. It does not have the all out action of Taken (make sure to see the Extreme Hard Edition of Taken) but for fans of Liam Nisson this is still a winner. Fans who like some action mixed with political intrigue should have a great time with this.
3,you can see it coming!,"Great little cold war type thriller with good performances but the denouement was way over dueby the time it arrived.Strange scene between Langella and Ganz could be a master class in acting but seems like it belonged in another, more interesting movie."
3,Well worth watching,"Movie is definitely reminiscent of Liam Neeson's hit ""Taken"" but with more plot and character development as opposed to the non-stop action of ""Taken"". I disagree with reviewers who claim there was not enough action. Taken was slightly unbelievable with the main character a virtual killing machine, mowing down everything that got in front of him. Neeson's character in this film was much more believable, apparently lacking the ability to kill everything that walks. The surprise twist was an efficient way to tie the questions in the plot together and add a sense of ""danger"" to Neeson's character. While its not the greatest action adventure I've ever seen, it is definitely worth the cost of the DVD."
3,Revamped Totall Recall,"Liam Neesen plays a guy who is injured in an accident and finds, when he wakes from a 4 day coma, that someone else has taken over his life. Are there no original ideas anymore? I kept thinking of Total Recall while I was watching this film.Whil I like Liam and have nothing against him, aren't there any younger actors who could have played this character? The guy was supposedly born in 1964 (as seen in his passport in the movie). Liam is just a little too seasoned at nearly 60, to be playing this guy."
3,Snore a thon,Movie has a great plot but no pay off weak ending but some very good acting just left me wanting more sorry
3,Movie Mixture,Plain and simple this movie is a combination of Total Recall and The Bourne Series tied up into one movie. That doesnt make it bad nor does it make it great. The story is there and I at least could not figure it out until the end. Good action sequences and acting. Its more like a 3.5 stars. Worth watching for a home rental.
3,Too many resemblances with Bourne identity!,"First at all, I must say Liam Neeson is a versatile actor, the cast who accompanied him (Dianne Krugger, Charlize Theron and Paz Vega are to my mind the three most beautiful actresses of the world, Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella) is towering too.But once more, let's remember Hitchcock. ""The three basic elements of a good movie are First: a good script,Second, a good script and Third a good script.Maybe the hand of Roman Polanski (who is in his element with this material) would have carried the movie for better destinies. But the spectacular chases are by themselves the jewel of the crown, leaving behind the raw material of a script which could have been improved.Nevertheless, the film is watchable but it will be forgotten soon. An entertained movie but never a memorable one."
2,Been done better,"First, I really like Liam Neeson and wanted to love this movie. I didn't. It had serious pacing issues, to the point where a good 45 minutes could have been taken out of it. The acting was okay, and despite the amount of stars in this movie, there were more wooden scenes than interesting ones. This type of movie has been done better, and I won't mention by who in case you haven't seen it yet. If I tell you which movie takes the prize for this type of storyline, you'll instantly know ""the secret"" of the film. So I won't.My family, who usually loves a good action adventure, was bored with this one. I have to say, I was too."
3,It's OK,"Interesting twist and a few surprises, but not great. Some very good action sequences and tense moments, but less powerful than other films."
3,"Silly, but action-packed","If you like fast-paced action flicks and don't expect too much in the way of plot, you will enjoy this movie. The amnesia plot got pretty dumb by the end."
5,A Trip Back in Time,"DIRT FLOOR was a personal history lesson on one of the most interesting periods of American history. Custer took me back in time to the point that I could understand what it was like to make do with so little during the Depression. He was born without the presence of a doctor, and from then on he learned how to make do. This family did what they had to do to survive, and Custer tells his story openly and honestly. I enjoyed the book tremendously and learned a lot!"
5,Love it,"What a great movie, after passing the booth at last years comic com I was already interested and am happy to say that its awesome. My only gripe is that most of the film maintains a extremely serious tone which I think would have been a problem if the movie were longer, I like a movie that can play at my emotion. Otherwise great and worth every penny."
2,HE'S NOT ROBIN,"HE'S NOT ROBIN OF BATMAN & ROBIN, VERY SLOW MOVING, BORING, AND NOT A GOOD CHARACTER THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY WHOMEVER..."
2,Who exactly is writing the reviews for this mediocre movie?,"Please, don't believe the hype, and ignore all the stellar reviews: this is one really bad movie! And the female lead's acting--the lady detective--is primarily the reason why--along with a go-nowhere script, and a ""twist"" ending that fails to justify the experience in tedium, and isn't worth your time investment. Poor writing, a run-of-the-mill vigilante plot, and overall mediocre acting renders this movie worthy of avoiding. Again, it's really bad -- you've been warned!"
3,Common sense information,I bought this book looking for new ideas. I found that it was no-brainer stuff that I already knew. I guess it is good to reminded of the simple stuff but I looked through it once and have never looked at it again. You could find the same info online for free.
2,A statics problem folder,"This book is fair. Its strengths are the quantitiy of problems presented and the fact that the answers to nearly all the problems are in the back of the book. The diagrams to the problems are also very good. The weaknesses: presentation of the concepts is light. It is difficuly to build an intellectual understanding of the material from the reading. The ""whys"" are not explained. Methods are presented a la carte. This book desperately needs a solutions manual."
1,9th edition 2nd printing has many errors,"If you are buying this for an Engineering Statics class, I would suggest trying to locate the 9th edition, 1st printing. Although the text portion is identical, the problem sections in the 2nd printing often refer to illustrations that are nonexistant or incorrect. In addition, the many answers have no correlation to the referenced problem at all. Our instructor assigns many problems as homework, and this has caused major headaches for a majority of the class. I have compared the two printings, and the 1st printing does not contain these errors. Otherwise, the book does a very good job in explaining the various concepts. NOTE: The people at Prentice Hall are unsure if new replacements will be available until after this semester (Spring 2003). DO NOT BUY THE 2ND PRINTING IF YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO WORK THE PROBLEMS."
1,I rate this book as being extremely poor!!!,This book is difficult to follow. The explanations and examples are not clear. It is bad enough that the problems are not clear cut. But it is even worse that a solution manual is not offered for this book.
2,Is there a Workbook or Study Guide?,"The many pictures, diagrams and photos are very helpful. However, a Workbook and Study Guide would GREATLY benefit in my study of the subject. Such an ancillary is mentioned in the preface, yet I cannot find one for sale anywhere. Does a Workbook or Study Guide exist for this book?"
4,Judy Garland,"Judy Garland behind the scenes of her life and loves, triumphs and tragedies.Weep No More My Lady : The Best Selling Story Of Judy Garland"
3,Accurate but dry.,"Go ahead and use this book as a reference. Skim it once in a while to refresh your memory about correct legal style. But don't sit down and read it straight through, as I did. I found it slow going and dry."
5,Legal writing never goes out of style,"It seems we all have to learn to read legal documents to some extent even if we can afford an attorney. After all, it's everywhere: case citations, endless references to precedent, citations to authoritative sources and a host of formalities to follow.I found a way to learn to read legal documents - by learning the basics of legal writing. It's a direct path. Because of this book I easily recognize predictive analysis, persuasive analysis, legal drafts and academic legal writing. This has helped me navigate legalese, the standard abstruseness writing style. This is the basis for cell phone contracts and many other real-life situations where it's not necessary to call an attorney.In summary, I got this book just to educate myself a little regarding legal documents. It helped me gain confidence in doing things we all have to do."
5,All You Need,"This book is AMAZING! It is chock full of terms and definitions, plus gorgeous pictures. It is not one of those books with no color or pictures in it. So you not only have a wealth of information at your fingertips, but you also get to see beautiful pictures/examples of terms along the way."
2,Alright,This is a alright book to add to anyone collect. I didn't find this book to be useful to me. Its more along the lines of a children/teen book to learn in science class.
2,"Skip the Way, go for the Mind.","Although I'd agree that for the most part, the two books are the same, the McKinsey Mind does address one important point- that of framing a process of Hypothesis Testing & Validation (actually taking you through some of the basic steps). The approach of breaking down an issue into subissues I found rather useful as it does help in sorting ideas and in creating a structured framework from which to attack a problem. Unfortunately, THAT is one of the only things about this book that I found somewhat useful. If you really want to see it for yourself, go to the bookstore and sift through the pages on hypothesis testing. Invest your money in actual consulting case studies books, as they will be of greater help."
1,"Nothing New, Nothing Useful","Frankly speaking, you will learn nothing from this book. First of all, everything the authors know/will tell you is already in their previous book, ""The McKinsey Way"". Indeed, both books are shallow and superficial. Those two books can be presented in a 5-page summary (more or less the content pages). Examples given are too simple. If that were the real life case, we would never need consultants to solve problems or devise strategies. Furthermore, do we need the authors to write so many pages about how to apply the 80/20 rule? The appendices of this book are useless. Some of the sources listed and their descriptions appear several times identically on different pages.Where are the authors from? McKinsey?!?$... is not a lot of money, but there are million ways to use it in a better way. Most of all, reading this book is a waste of time."
1,"amazingly shallow, specially coming from McKinsey","I was desiring and willing to learn from the McKinsey approach. I can't overemphasize how dissapointed I am with this book. Lots of comments on what to do and why to do it but all presented at a very conceptual level without any information regarding the ""how"". I doubt many will find anything new in this book they haven't heard before, not to mention its poor layout and presentation. If the authors had follow the book's suggestions, the end reult would have been better."
1,I hope there is more to mckinsey than this book,"To call this book a ""survey book"" of the mckinsey way would be an overstatement. Perhaps a better term would be a 200 page infomercial.The constant reference to ""mckinseyites"" and ""the Firm"" are enough to alienate even the largest devotees of their methods.I gave up about half way through. This book never gets past the blatently obvious. I suspect that anyone who would buy this book has at least a rudimentary knowledge of business. I am sorry to say that this book does not go much past there."
1,This is a terrible book...,"This book is unbelieveably bad. Here's the entire book: Decide what your looking at, develop a hypothesis, test it with data, do some communications around your work. Literally. I expected some real, in depth analysis techniques, and this is total baloney. I am an engineer by trade, well versed in six sigma tools and am close to an MBA; in all of that I've never ever seen something so fluffy and useless as this. The authors and ""McKinsey-ites"" who contributed should be ashamed.Gosh, I sound a little bitter ;)"
2,Very few valuable insights,"While I'm sure that McKinsey has many sharp individuals, I found that this book gave me no significant insights into why McKinsey and their methods would stand out in comparison with other major consulting organizations. I came away with little in the way of new valuable tools or frameworks to apply. The authors clearly liked their experience with McKinsey, and come off a bit too enthusiastic in their praise of ""the firm""."
2,Not very pleasant reading: had to force myself to finish it,"This book is not as insightful as how the title makes it out to be. It misses the fundamental point is that the reason Mckinsey is so successful is because it knows the subject matter cold. Or at least it knows it from one client in the industry to apply it to another.Its great to have the frameworks and ideas discussed in the book from a theoretical standpoint but the authors really need to acknowledge the whole subject matter concept. Not everybody reading this book will have the benefit of an org with a 120 year legacy (and knowledge practices on how to acquire subject matter expertise).The book should have recognized that from the outset, and at least made an attempt on how to go about (in a simpler way) the process by which the reader should acquire it."
2,Like a film that does not quite deliver,"The book seems to promise a lot, you know, pick up and use on a project or with your prospective clients right now!No this book is much like many films that we waste our money on due to excellent marketing and hype... Promising a lot and not really giving you anything you can use NOWIf you want to be able to manage projects and deliver them on time and on budget, then there are plenty of books that will give you more than the insight that was given here!Nice cover once you get the glossy jacket off! That's all I can say."
3,Loved Mckinsey way...not nearly as Impressed with this...,"After reading McKinsey way, I immediately went out and bought this book. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of good stuff in here, but I was just not impressed. I think I will reread it, and see if I can draw more from it, but the chapters were not interesting in the first read through. No strategy book is a complete waste, and I got a lot out of it, it was just not what I expected.Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" book sereies and the brand new ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
3,A Very High Level View,"Being co-authored by a business school alum, I had to buy this book. I believe it provides a pretty good overview of how business consultants (mostly strategy) approach problems analytically. It introduces readers to hypothesis based analysis.If you are looking for examples of detailed analysis performed by McKinsey consultants look elsewhere. It is not in this book.Bob Donnellan"
5,"Smooth, Crisp and Careful","The McKinsey Mind is a smooth, crisp and careful explanation about how the world-renowned firm continues to build and rebuild the foundations of top corporations and organizations. The authors, ex-McKinsey consultants, lay bare the mechanism in a methodical format aimed at teaching the reader how the firm does its job. The steps are simple: get data, analyze it well, and sell the results to everyone in sight. The book's main value, though, is illustrating just how to do this in a stylish, subtle, and understated way. The best lesson is imitating the authors.As the back cover says, giving a man a fish will only feed him for a day, but teaching him to fish the McKinsey way is a lesson that lasts forever. Reading the book is certainly cheaper than hiring them to fish for you for a day."
2,More of the same!,"Nothing new in the book.This book is very similar to the first (the McKinsey Way) - more fluff and nothing concrete. Ah! ""structure your study"", ""gather data and interpret it correctly"" , ... come on.. anybody knows that! How else does one come to conclusions (other than fact based, structured reasoning). If you have read the contents page you have read the book! (This may sound harsh, but seriously its true!)The authors themselves mention the fact that they cannot detail McKinsey's techniques and go on to detail their own methodology ""BASED"" on the McKinsey methodologies. We don't need teasers and brand leveraged superficial mumbo-jumbo. Facts - these guys need to walk their talk! (Read the ""About Confidentiality"" section in the ""Introduction"" chapter).Not recommended!"
1,This book was a waste of my time,"If you have ever taken a one or two day Problem Solving/Project Management class, this book will be a waste of time for you. It is a watered down (way down) version of Problem Solving/PM 101. This is particularly ironic because the authors comment on how much better the McKinsey approach is when compared to other successful companies (e.g. GE,GlaxoSmithKline, and others). My experience is that GE's Six Sigma and other ""tools"" blow the McKinsey approach away. It is very hard to believe that McKinsey became a successful consulting firm by implementing these very elementary principles. Either the authors were too scared of violating their Proprietary Information Agreements to write anything of substance OR McKinsey simply has no practices, tools, techniques, or methodology that contribute to their success. Either way, this book will do NOTHING to increase your knowledge of how to solve business problems."
1,Underwhelming to say the least,"Simply put this was one of the worst books that I have read in quite some time. I purchased the book expecting to learn more about structuring, analyzing and solving ambiguous business problems. I was also interested in the discussion of structuring/presenting solutions and managing teams and the client.What I got lacks any real content or depth. For example, gems of wisdom from the analysis section include: find the key drivers, look at the big picture, and don't boil the ocean.This book did not live up to my expectations and I would NOT recommend it to those who are looking for tools to help sharpen their analytic and problem solving skills."
3,"Great for anyone addressing a large case, worships 'the firm' too much","Learning how McKinsey works and thinks is massively beneficial for anyone wanting to become a consulting, especially if they have never been exposed to the field before. I follow it when addressing large 100+ page papers, as well as presentations. The book does get a little lavish with 'the firm' and the sources of evidence used for ethos become obviously repeated and little but still a good book"
1,Big flop,"Big name and promise, but poor content. Any aspiring MC can do away without it. If you find it at the road side, just browse through or couple of visits to yur nearby book shop will serve the purpose. In short don't buy."
4,"Great refresher for MBAs, good insight for Consultants","Don't buy this book if you want to learn how to be a consultant or if you want to learn how to solve problems. BUY this book if you want to get a different perspective on problem solving and presentation techniques that can help you throughout your whole life!Most of what they teach is common sense but this is also to say that the most difficult problems usually have simple solutions. You don't know until you solve them! Or in this case, until you read the book.The most important parts of this book are the MECE technique and the chapter on presentations. If you're an MBA they give you great advice on how to prepare and present your cases, class presentations, etc. If you're a consultant, they can give you good insight on how to stand out during proposal presentations and in creating deliverables.A good book overall."
5,Official Story of Earth Wind & Fire,"I see this DVD before< is very good<I'm taiwaness , so , write english is very bad,"
4,"IF YOU LIKE ""THE STORY OF"" AND ""BEHIND THE SCENE""",Filled with incredible stories as told by the guys with rare old footage of EWF.. Well done and it's so nice to see Maurice White..I loved it!
4,Worth your While,"I just purchased this DVD and I truly love it. I have grown up with Maurice's career and this DVD follows his life perfectly. I grew up in the same time frame as Maurice White and feel that if you never knew the history of Earth Wind and Fire that this is the DVD to get to catch up. This man is the true modest genius of our time. The tour that they are on now is possibly an event to catch if Maurice is with them. The new CD is the most excellent ""back to basics"" I would expect from the GREATEST BAND to play the real music we deserve."
4,Good for the price and concept,"I bought this based on other reviews. It does a great job of covering up my windows and it doesn't look too awful. I live in a studio and didn't want to buy expensive window treatments, and since it's such a small space, didn't want to buy anything without being careful as to how I want to decorate it.This was a great, inexpensive way to quickly get some shades up for privacy without making a real commitment on window treatments.The paper tears easily, but once it's up, it should be fine. I don't really put my paper blinds up since I'm not home during the day anyway. It works well on my window that has an air conditioner as well - I just cut it to size and clipped it with the given clips to the unit.I will say that cutting it was a bit difficult, but I had dinky little scissors."
5,So easy to work with,"These are crazy easy to install. I just moved into a house with tons of windows and did not want to force myself into purchasing window treatments quickly. These shades provide privacy and a little bit of insulation too. If you plan to raise and lower these often, however, since they are paper they may be a pain."
5,Like a manual for the human body,"Everyone has aches and pains at some point in life, and the earlier we learn to self-treat our injuries, the better off we will be later in life. I myself have had numerous injuries, struggle with fibromyalgia and chonic pain. This book has saved me thousands in chiropractic care in just one year. It's such a relief to have help on hand whenever I have an ache that needs attention. I've yet to find an ache or pain that this book does not cover, and the treatment is so simple, even a child can do it."
5,Fabulous!,"Great book! I am currently going to massage school to get my certification. This book was very helpful in learning different places to look for possible problems. I am scared entering the field, but now have a little more confidence jumping in and healing people! This should definitely be part of your library!"
3,Very Technical,"This is a very comprehensive, detailed, technical tome. I bought it for my 85-year-old mother who said she had a difficult time finding things in this amount of copy. The exercises it recommended for specifics pain in specific muscle groups was good -- if you were able to isolate the area and muscles that were causing your pain. Still the informatin in this book is worth a shot at releiving a chronic pain situation."
3,good generic information,"a good book for the layperson to have...not too complicated, and yet still some useful info for the pro."
5,Excellent book to use for the average person,I love this book! It is easy to read and use to find relief within the first 15 minutes. It shows where to press to release the pain and I like that it breaks down where your pain is with a description of the type of pain. This makes it easy for me to determine which therapy to use for relief. Excellent book!
4,"Okay, But...","This a good trigger point therapy workbook, complete with ""rubberball"" tools, but the problem is, once again, this therapy is being touted as the ""be-all-end-all"" approach to pain management and health. Trigger point is a modality, a bodywork modality, and needs to be recognized as such. Just as massage, reflexology,and shiatsu are modalities, there needs to be a line drawn so people don't confuse this with a health book. Gangi's book does much better in defining our path to balanced health, and also redefines therapies such as this one so people aren't confused or misled. High on the list because it's used in massage schools, but not the best for people wanting to find the cause of their pain, and then dealing with it."
3,Dated,"A but pseudo science, but not horrible. Probably worth the money, but will take a motivated reader. Interesting concept in general."
3,Disappointed,"The first part of the book was interesting as he describes how he got interested in the subject.The second part and the actual ""doing"" instructions were much too difficult for the novice.I tried a pressure point only to discover that it was actually a place of referred pain. I still have a bruise on my arm as I pressed too hard. There was no warning that this could happen. It was my physical therapist that told me that I was pressing in the wrong place.Basically, it was no real help to me and I regret the purchase. One needs better skills to execute the procedures. He made it sound like anyone could do this and help themselves. Lots of luck!"
3,Good read but not very useful,The subject is very nicely described. The therapy as such was not very effective for me. It is one of those feel-good treatments if you are worried about facing surgery.I recommend this book a try it might work for others.
2,"The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook: Your Self-Treatment Guide for Pain Relief, Second Edition","This text provides a simple, elementary introduction to the subject of TP therapy, but falls far short of providing a truly useful guide for massage therapists wanting to become skilled in effectively applying these techniques on their clients. This is a large book with very little important information about the nature of TPs pathologies, comprised mostly of body mappings of probable TP locations within muscle groups that are grossly generalized and of little real use in TP palpation. The Davies wookbook is not an expensive guide for understanding the basic concepts, but the serious bodyworker will find little meat to the material before soon needing a much more in-depth guide to go further."
5,A must have book.,"I came across the names of Dr's Travell and Simons many years ago for my long running TMJ pain that was relived by trigger point therapy (PT - Joe). Since then, I concluded you have to be your own doctor am glad to see this wonderful book that gives you direction to take control of your pain. Thanks to these doctors the research has been done and we just have to apply it... Thankyou.I got a copy for a friend too; who is over the moon.This book is worth every penny, you do NOT have to live in pain; PLEASE HELP YOURSELF and OTHERS."
5,The Holy Grail of acute and chronic pain syndromes!,"This is the best book I have purchased and read that is the answer to all my pain complaints and those of my clients. I am a licensed massage therapist and highly urge others to read this book and take care of themselves first in order to be able to take better care of their clients. Very easy to read and understand. I am so thankful I found this book. Claire Davies, LMT is a genius."
5,Love the Trigger Points,"I just wanted to say that anyone that is having pains that the Medical Doctors say is in their heads, get this book. I am an acupressure therapist for a Chiropractor and we work great together. Every day I see people that have been told that they are beyond hope by the traditional medical community and the Chiropractor and I prove them wrong by using these simple but extremely effective techniques taught in this book. I use these trigger points on myself and all of my patients. My motto is ""If it doesn't hurt, you're doing it wrong."" I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to have a better control of their own health and help others gain control over theirs."
5,best 20 dollars ive spent in a while,i just got this book today after reading the reviews on how great it was. i havea a theracane and with using this book i already have had great results. i wish i would have bought this book months ago so i didnt have to go to PT. this books gives amazing detail and great advice on how to massage out trigger points.
4,Got Pain?,"I was in horrific knee pain in 2009 and found out about this book on Amazon. The reviews were so positive that I just had to run out to a bookstore and get the book immediately. I paid the full price. The Amazon price is better. You will spend an evening reading every detail about how to do trigger point therapy and you might not be confident that you're doing it correctly. Keep at it. It works. My chiropractor recommends trigger point therapy. I have small, skinny, fingers and found buying a knobbler, here on Amazon, a worthwhile device.If you are plagued with pain and are willing to learn how to alleviate your pain with Trigger Point Therapy, then this is a good investment, a very good investment."
5,New Hope,I have learned some invaluable techniques for pain management that bring me new hope for a pain-free future. It saves me money on the doctor visits that haven't been as effective as the do-it-myself techniques I am learning in the book. The tennis ball is my new best friend.
5,helpful,Good information. I have found trigger points I never knew I had. Very helpful info throughout the book. I will use for a long time.
5,"Awesome book, easy to use, worth the money","This book is easy to use, but also contains fairly detailed information about anatomy and physiology for those who care to read up.I have used it to deal with several stubborn muscles, including new aches and pains from getting back to the gym after a long period of inactivity. It's paid for itself several times in allowing me to release muscle knots at home rather than paying for a massage."
5,Touch Point works!,"I am so glad that I found these two books! I had scheduled surgery for my carpal tunnel problem. Before surgery I found these two books and tried it. To my surprise, IT WORKED! I cancelled my surgery, and every time I get a pain I massage a trigger point, and it goes away! It's a miracle! I am so excited! All those years that I have suffered from pains in various parts of my body were torture! Each one was addressed in this workbook, and I am so happy that I can do something to make the pain go away EVERY time! I wish everyone who has pain could have these books to try before they endure surgery."
5,Try the recommended massage equipment,"I got this book a couple of years ago, and it is dog-eared with use. I also use Shiatsu, Reiki, Accupressure and a number of other bodywork techniques, but the Triggerpoint work is unique and highly effective. I notice from reading other reviews that most readers seem to be using the tennis ball/lacrosse ball method to get at their trigger points. I have used the balls, too, and they're effective for some deep points that can't be reached in any other way, but I highly recommend that readers purchase the Backnobber (or TheraCane) and a Knobble tool, as recommended by the author, for more subtle control and more consistent results. These tools are available through Amazon. In fact, I'm sitting here writing this with my Backnobber hooked over my shoulder. 'Backnobbing' one's neck, shoulder and back triggerpoints while sitting at the computer is delicious and refreshing!"
2,Therapy,This book is written for the medically trained student and doctor. It is very hard to understand for the average person. I do not have the knowledge to really use the book.
5,triger point therapy,"Good book----haven't had much time to read it yet, but look forward to it after the holidays."
2,Too Pedantic - not user friendly,"This was toooo esoteric - Some of it even contradictory. The author(s) were very informative and knowledgeable, but did not compile this writing in a way that was very usable for the average lay person. I read all of the introductory pages and then referred to different sections. I found it so cumbersome to try and apply that I finally reverted back to my favorite acupressure book, ""Acupresssure's Potent Points"" by Michael Reed Gach. That I give 5 stars."
4,Trigger Point Thearpy,"Informative, good book. Arrived quickly - good price - good company. I am not a verbose person - the previous words will do as far as I am concerned."
4,Good Stuff,Worth every penny. It takes a little practice to get some of the techniques just right but the payoff is great.
4,Empowering!,"There are a lot of trigger points and in some cases it can be hard to figure out what is causing your problem. I haven't found the quick, magical relief suggested by some of the book's stories. However, I have learned a lot from this book about the types of things that can cause problems with different muscles, and this type of knowledge is very valuable. I have been to a well-regarded spine doctor and spent 2+ months in chiropractic/physical therapy and got almost no good information there. ""Don't bend or twist""--gee, thanks... My pain has always been intermittent so it is hard for me to tell whether any treatment helps, but with this book my mental anxiety is much less because I feel like I understand my body a lot better."
5,Cured my back pain,"This pain started in a Ti Chi exercise class about 6 years ago. Just a nagging mid back pain that came and went. Chiropractic treatment helped but I could not do aerobics because it would come back. The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook showed me where and how to treat it. I got relief from the first self treatment and was cured within one week. Since then I have helped my son with his knee pain. I highly recommend this book, much pain and suffering can be avoided!"
4,Educational,"I enjoyed this book up to a point. It was helpful to get an idea of where the trigger points are that could be causing my specific pain. However, so many muscles with their own trigger points can be within the same small areas that I gave up after a while and just went with the first few I had identified."
4,useful directions for self therapy,This book tells how to relieve pain in various place of the body. It can be used on another person or on oneself.
5,"No more pain, without meds!!","One more testimonial to say that this wonderful book really ""changed my life"". Is, as I call it, the ""human body's owner's guide""Of particular importance I like that the author explains in detail what type of activities cause the trigger points to become active, so I can really learn how to better use my body and stay active and perform all the activities i want while avoiding injuries or re-setting the trigger points, and if I do, i know how to ""fix"" them. This has helped me rule out nonsense like ""i have an injured back"" and so on. It turned out to be a trigger point in my gluteus from sitting all day in the office..."
5,This book saves me visits to the pain management doctor!,"After a failed back surgery 5 years ago that left me with more pain than prior to surgery, I've been to 3 pain management doctors, 4 physical therapists, two chiropractors and several massage therapists. I finally found a pain management doctor (Dr. John Tyler)in Colorado Springs who uses the Travell & Simons Trigger Point methods that have provided the most relief for the chronic sciatica, lumbar and leg pain following surgery. Although I have to return for follow up visits from time to time, I'm able to relieve some of the pain myself using the techniques demonstrated in this book. Since I know of no other doctor who uses these techniques, I recommend this book to those who suffer from pain. I hope you, too, will find relief from your pain."
5,Brilliant,"The best book I have ever read. I think everyone should have a copy of this fantastic book. It helped me soo much.It has detailed pictures of the muscles, why they come into trouble, examples of people with problems, various tools and ways to massage yourself. You fee like a professional massage therapist after you have read it.TOPS!!!"
5,The Answer!,"This book is the answer to pain. I was able to find the sources of my neck, head, chest and foot pains. The exercises to massage the corresponding trigger points are easy and highly effective. With many of them I feel immediate relief! If I was a millionaire I'd buy a copy of this book for every person I run into that complains of pain."
5,"how do you say, ""pain relief""?","I have used this book for finding trigger points in my back for recurrent neck and shoulder pain, but when I herniated a disc it did not occur to me to turn to it immediately. It was when I had terrible cramping in my calf and thigh that pulled the book out again. I was able to get relief at 2AM that ice and heat faled to help with and during that time I had to wait for pain meds to take effect. My husband has carple tunnel syndrom that he is able to get some relief from. It is a great book, with picture diagrams, to go with step by step directions. This book is a great investment."
2,Very textbook,"I would guess this was a textbook for physical therapists. I got some good things out of it, but the jargon was very technical. Probably great for professionals. Not easy to read or access the information."
3,WORKbook,"This book is detailed. Which was very discouraging when I first cracked it open. I was expecting a workbook but it much more like a text book. I found it hard to find put any information with out reading everything thing. There aren't any summaries, or steps at a glance, which makes it very difficult to use in the limited free time I have after work. Its not an entirely bad book, it is very informative and detailed. However if you are time limited, not interested in reading a lot or impatient, this is most likely not what you are looking for."
3,The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook,I still have not heard form my friend if she received this book. I sent it to her because I liked it myself.
3,Useful Handbook,"This book was a useful application handbook but lacks much of the theory and research that made the original concepts of trigger point management understandable and universally applicable. However, if one is interested in getting into the crux of the management for a specific pain covered in this book, this is a handy manual. If on the other hand, general principles and applications are needed because one's pain does not exactly fit the patterns described, then this might be difficult based on this book alone."
2,Too technical,The book was written with too many medical terms for a layman like me to be able to easily grasp many of the methods. I am sure if I were better educated I would be able to benefit more from the instructions.
5,Great resource,"This is a great resource for massage therapists and laypeople alike. Practical suggestions for self-help in pain relief, but the information can be easily adapted to use to help others. It translates trigger point therapy it into simple, concise, and readable text. The illustrations are helpful as well. Highly recommended."
5,"I was skeptical too, but It WORKS!","I have been applying the trigger point techniques for several months. I started working on my ""frozen shoulder"" which responded slowly, but positively to the trigger point therapy. So was it just coincidence or maybe placebo effect? I became convinced after I applied the techniques to my knees which have been giving me problems since high school. (I'm in my fifties now). I gained almost immediate relief from knee pain which had been diagnosed as osteoarthritis many years ago. I also had a wicked case of Iliotibial band syndrome and gained 80% relief within twenty four hours of trigger therapy. This shocked me because in the past it has taken weeks to recover from a bout of ITB pain. This book does require some work and study to learn the muscle nomenclature and jargon. However, it is worth the effort. I have gotten more benefit from trigger point therapy than I have from knee surgery and thousands of dollars of various meds and other therapies."
5,Essential for body awareness,"I have been giving this book as a gift, together with ""Back Care Basics,"" since I discoverd its value in taking care of my body. I learned that many of the exercises I have used in the past, even those recommended by physical therapists, were actually doing damage to my muscles. Through the knowledge I acquired in this book, I am more able to help myself. I have severe back problems (scoliosis) and have been able to identify the muscles involved in my ""out of balance"" condition. I am 65 years old and do not expect a cure for my damaged spine; I believe, though, that if I had this information 20 years ago, much of that damage could have been prevented. Even now,physicians are amazed that I am not in a wheelchair. I have also been able to alleviate the discomfort in many other stressed muscles throughout my body."
5,Best Health Book I've Ever Purchased,"For me, this book, along with a thera-cane and tennis ball, has been phenomenal. This book should be on cosmic auto-delivery for anyone over 40. After reading perhaps 30 pages specific to my issues, the techniques over several months have cured long term knee discomfort, carpal tunnel like symptoms that made typing for more than 20 minutes very uncomfortable, as well as hip pain that at times disturbs my sleep. The authors really know how the body works. The techniques have helped, yet not cured, a long standing hamstring issue, though success in other areas has given me hope that continued work will bring the hamstring and associated sit bone discomfort, relief.Without a doubt, this is the most effective health related book I have every purchased in my life and I'm happy to enthusiastically recommend it."
4,very useful,The book is very practical. It is very well organized and illustrated. It is also very clearly exposed. I learned a lot from it.
5,very user freindly,Finally some practical advice about all those aches and pains that can't seem to be explained.This book is very thorough with tons of diagrams.I even discussed it with my massage therapist!!
2,brody,It is a rather technical book and you really cannot do the trigger points very easily yourself. Quite complicated to figure out just where they are. I was unable to use the book for my sciatica poblem as could not really find the trigger points. Maybe someone more advanced in the human body would be better able to use the techniques described in the book. Definitly not for a novice.
4,A lot of pages,"I like short to the point books. I bought this with the use of a body back buddy. I don't know if I will be able to read every page, but there is a lot of good info in this book. To me some of it is obvious, but then again a lot of it is new info. I think it was worth the money. And glad I got it."
3,fibromyalgia,This book is more for the physical therapist not someone who wants to do these exercises themselves. If you know how to do them then you might like this book....I don't understand the terminology because I'm not a trained therapist.
4,Comprehensive,"I find The Trigger Point Therapy Wookbook very detailed and comprehensive. You should only buy this wookbook if you are serious about finding a solution and prepared to study and work on it. I have serious sciatic pain and have tried everything to get relief. The book, with quite a bit of study, helped me located the muscles causing the problem. Using the 'ball' technique I massaged the appropriate 'tigger points'. After 3 weeks, persistence is also required, I have begun to get relief and the pain has diminished. The bottom line is this book is a great book provided your motivated. Its not for the faint hearted and its not a 'quick fix'."
4,good book if yu stick with it,"This book highlights a lot of things you just never consider. The only drawback is that the massaging is difficult to do yourself, but if you can get a massage therapist (or husband!)to get the right spots then it is worth it. I have not been able to keep up with the massages daily as suggested- but when I do them ,I have to admit I feel better. I have stiff fingers and the book points out this is radiating from my neck and forearms. To work on yourself is hard though-"
4,Neck pain relief,"I stumbled onto this book when I did a Google search for 'neck pain'. I bought it for my Dad who has been suffering from severe neck pain for many months. He has tried all sorts of therapy without any relief so I thought the cost of the book seemed worth a punt. Anyway, I haven't read it myself so can't comment from personal experience but my Dad has read the book and tells me that it is very interesting. His only negative comment was that a lot of the terminology is hard to understand for the average person. Despite that, he has started treating himself using the techniques described in the book, and, although far from cured, he says that the treatment is definitely helping. Thank you."
5,Solved a multi-year battle with sciatica in a few sessions,"This book solved sciatica for both myself and my friend.A few years ago, a difficult move in Pilates resulted in deep pain in the sciatic area. This book solved it for me in one session.Lately my friend's longstanding sciatica has been flaring up past previous levels and interfering with her sleep and quality of life. Although I had recommended the book to her in the past, when it solved my own problem, she had never been convinced.I went ahead and sent her the book. She slept through the night after one session, and is almost pain-free after a few sessions at home and one professional session.My father's tennis buddies have been passing this book around to solve all of their irritations. Now everybody loves it, and one of his friends is considering studying trigger point therapy as a career change.My uncle has also solved longstanding golfing issues.This book is nothing short of a miracle."
5,Best self therapy book,"it has helped me improve my persistent shoulder,neck pain, sit bone pains, knee pain....it is brilliantly worth every penny and so much more.."
5,Awesome Reference,This book is a must have to find those trigger points that cause pain and aches throughout your body. It is a necessity read to conduct self massage and treatment. Can't live without it.
5,Favorite composers drawn together,"Hard to select the best from geniuses like Mozart, Bizet and Boccherini but this is a good start."
3,great concert...expected much better sound,I liked the concert a lot.....just expected much better sound...have several other concerts not on blu-ray that sound much better...sounds like there are microfones....3 ft away taking the audio....well at least thats what I felt.....
4,Still Sounding Great,"When I first got this I wanted an HD DVD of a concert just to see if the audio was just as great as people said it was. So I popped 'er in and WOW, was I impressed. They still got it. When Bobby Kimball starts singing you know you are in for a ride.The third song, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, is easily a new favorite. I found myself popping this in just for this one song alone. Watching Lukather rip it up on this track is exciting every time.It looks awesome for the majority too, especially on the close ups. The only real problem with HD is that I it seems I'm always noticing when the camera goes out of focus. Not a big problem, but can get annoying when you are trying to focus on how amazing the detail is on their shirts or guitar straps.Overall the sound is great and the visuals just pull you in and you feel like you are actually there. Definitley a must have for any serious Toto fan or anyone who likes good live music."
5,Toto - Live in Amsterdam,"Great picture, awsome sound, only thing lacking, would have liked to have heard more of a greatest hits package. Not enough old material in full song format. Worth buying!Martin CopperthwaiteSwanson, Sask, Canada"
4,Good Show -,"Been a Toto fan for over 20 years. I've seen Toto many times but only in small venues in the US. It's amazing to see how large a stadium Toto can fill in Europe.Fantastic musicians. Great recording. You can always tell the proficiency of a musician/group by how well they sound live - and these guys are pros.The ONLY thing that disappoints me (why I gave it 4 stars) is the sheer number of tunes from the first four albums (I know - Bobby Kimball). But how about ""Dave's Gone Skiing"" or ""Jake to the Bone""?"
1,audio on this disc is NOT good; no outstanding performances,"I have to take exception to what many have written; I think the audio on this disc is terrible! Sure it's not as horrific as that Sting Live dvd (arguably the worst to date) but it is far from acceptable for this ""musician's band"". The drum production in particular is quite poor.For the record, am a fan of the band (overall), am an audio professional, own a recording studio, and reviewed this HD dvd via an excellent 7.1 tuned home theater.I think that many Toto fans will be expecting both stellar performances and post production, and I can assure you that you will find neither on this disc.I can however, strongly recommend the newer disc, Falling In Between. Not out on Blu-Ray yet (it's rumored later this year or early next) the dvd blows away what you will find on the Amsterdam HD or Blu-Ray.Trust me on this one audiophiles; skip Amsterdam and go right to Falling In Between. the audio is pristine and the performances are much better too."
2,snippets,"i have plenty of music dvd's and usually when they sound to perfect you wonder if the audio was enhanced in the studio, but when i watched the first ten minutes of this atrocity and they played ''medley's'' twice it seems on the disc i never let it get to the second ''medley'' because all they did was play a snippet of ''i'll supply the love'', ''you had me , you lost me'' i shut this thing down and now it will double as a coaster, and as for the sound it definately was not one of the best, you people who thought it was, better listen to ''the farewell tour by the eagles'' where the sound is great but you wonder if it was fooled with in the studio, still i would rather have the latter, this bombastic attempt is for die hard toto fans only and as for great song selection all i can say is ''who you crappin''"
1,"This is NOTa standard DVD, I repeat do not get this if you do not have an HD DVD","OK so everyone can make mistakes but c'mon how many people actually own an HD DVD Player? Not many eh based on the reviews I read...SO...Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT ORDER THIS DVD IF you have a Standard DVD Player.You need to order the description for DVD only.Anyway I had to return two torturous returns, one damaged and one not damaged and that is a lot of pain and suffering since I've been waiting to watch this DVD for around 2 weeks now...GEEZ give me a break.One more last thing, what the hell? Now everyone will eventually have to buy a new HD DVD Player? Is money growing on trees? I think NOT!!!!!"
3,Great Music - Not so great audio mix,"So many reviews said this DVD/BD was great so I bought it. I had no issues with the band, the music, and the video production. My only criticism is that the audio mix was very flat and left the music feeling lifeless. Even my wife commented on it saying, ""it sounds like there is a sheet covering the whole thing.""We have a great setup with Pioneer decoder, Emotiva discrete amplifiers and Destination Audio towers with Velodyne subs. We quickly pulled out our copy of Phil Collins' Last Final Farewell DVD just to be sure we weren't missing something, and we weren't. The audio mix for this Toto DVD is just as good.After watching it, we donated it to the local library."
2,Great Performance Average Sound,"Great performance but thought the sound was well below par. Check out the Paris concert with Jeff Porcaro, much better despite the poor singing from that strange dude (forgot his name). Overall dissapointing, but the groove of Toto was lost after the tragic death of JP. Steve Lukather's sound was not up to it (very distant at times), Paris was amazing!!!"
5,GREAT LIVE BAND,"TOTO WAS NEVER ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS, BUT I LOVED THE SONG AFRICA, WHEN IT CAME OUT ON THE RADIO. WHEN I SAW THIS DVD HAD THAT SONG, I BOUGHT IT. WHAT A FANTASTIC LIVE BAND! THE MUSICIANSHIP IS FLAWLESS AND THE SOUND IS EXCELLENT. THE VOCALS BLEW ME AWAY. BOBBY KIMBALL DOES'NT SOUND LIKE HE MISSED A DAY OF SINGING. ALL HARMONIES ARE ON THE MONEY. IF YOU LIKE GUITAR VIRTUOSITY, WHAT CAN I SAY. IT'S STEVE LUTHAKER. EACH MUSICIAN PLAYS AND SOUNDS GREAT. THIS WILL BECOME A FAVORITE OF MUSICIANS, AND OF COURSE, TOTO FANS."
3,TOTO on DVD,"Good DVD, not great. Now I love TOTO but to be honest, the audio is weak. I have a couple of DVD concerts that the audio mix is poor resulting in a great concert playing not so great in the home. I play guitar and I like the instruments to stand out. If a guy is playing lead you need to hear it not have it part of the background music. I have a very good home theather setup so I know its not my system. I have around 30 concert DVD's and there are about 7 that lack good audio. Shame really that TOTO should be one of these. Otherwise they play all the tumes I love to hear. With good audio this would be as close to 5 as you can get.Keep listening!"
4,Toto still rocks,four or five tracks from this dvd concert at absolutely the best. great to see that TOTO still rocks at 25 years.
4,4-star Flashback,"Despite what the others mentioned I did like the sound (admittedly you need to turn the volume up to get the real good sound) as well as the picture quality, even though it's presented in 1080i only, but hey, that's definitely good enough for a concert video. ""Africa"" comes in awesome, and so does ""Rosanna"". Would have appreciated ""Child"" as a separate tune indetad of being a part of a medley. Still, definitely 4 stars."
4,Toto at their best but next time get another director ...,"In a nutshell, Toto is fantastic on this DVD, the music and the mix are brilliant. A must have for whoever loves music. Why didn't I put 5 stars? Not because of the music.The down side on the DVD has nothing to do with the band at all but with the lightshow and the movie director. The way it was shot makes the show look as flat as an American Idol show. This does not reflect at all the atmosphere during Toto's concerts. Guys, get another director. Watch the tape, for example, of your superb performance at Taratata TV show, years ago, and the great work Pulliccino did with the directing. Hire this guy next time."
5,Simply Stunning,Unbelievably great. Simply the best playing in the popular genre that anyone will ever hear. Forget the less than maximum stars from some reviewers. They have no clue. Great video. Great audio. Fabulous playing. A must have.As for the one idiot who bought this thinking it was a standards DVD. Jesus: 'nuff said! The other person who wanted all their 'hits'. Forget it. Any true musicians want to continue to evolve and progress. This is fabulous. Don't be put off by cloth-eared cretins!
2,Audio and Video quality good...but the band isn't in their prime anymore,"I really love some of Toto's songs, and some of them can still bring it, but some of the band members are showing their age. The lead vocals in ""Africa"" just isn't the smooth, melodic voice you remember from the 80's.Also, my personal opinion is that it's inexcusable to release a Blu-ray disc of a concert and not offer any type of lossless audio. This disc doesn't have 5.1 uncompressed PCM, nor Dolby TrueHD, nor DTS-HD Master Audio (or even high res, for that matter.) **IF YOU ARE A MUSICAL GROUP, WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT YOUR MUSIC PLAYED IN THE BEST AUDIO FORMATS AVAILABLE?** I just don't get it."
3,"Stops blisters, but has trouble staying up on your legs.","These socks do stop me from having blisters on my feet. More specifically, I would get blisters on my big toes from playing basketball. Since using these socks, I haven't had any blisters, but the biggest problem now is the socks do not stay up. SO two or three times during the game, I have to take my shoe off and pull the socks up. I am going to try and get a rubber band or something to hold the socks to my leg...Overall, it is worth dealing with pulling my socks up, to not have blisters..."
2,Oh please...,C'Mon you guys... ever heard of a VCR? Just buy blank tapes and record the darn shows. No need to pay for a video that only fits a few episodes when a video tape can fit 8 episodes. Technology... it's here so use it. =)
2,user un-friendly,"Though I'm very pleased with the feel of the leathery black jacket outside and the inner fabric covering, that's about all that's good about M-edge's jacket.The socket that holds the iLiad is simply too tight. It is impossible to get the stylus out when the iLiad is inside the cover. Also, the outer edges are very badly designed; they force you to lift your fingers a bit higher than usual to make the page turns, which becomes extremely annoying for an avid 1000-pages-a-day reader like me.M-edge's goal to create a good looking cover in the end kills it by turning a wonderful device like the iLiad into one that I just don't want to pick up."
5,Execute trades & trading plans successfully,"The best of what's out there, and a very good book it is. This is not a book on trading systems or money management. It is a book to enable the trader to improve his/her trading. All of us suffer from emotional blockages, many unconcious. It is the result of growing up in less than perfect homes. RBR offers a step-by-step approach to finding and dealing with the blockages the interefer with YOUR trading. Caps on ""your"" because RBR uses a paradigmatic rather than case-specific approach. Next best book so far is Tharp's ""Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom,"" which, while good, is a distant second. Of course, if your computer finds the trades, places the orders and exits the trades, and all you do is have the broker send you a check every month, this book is of no value to you. I haven't become that clever yet."
2,"Good Psychobbale, Not Good Trading Advice","No trading is not a mind game, it is a winning system and you get no system here pal. What you get is motivation to seek a way to win but nothing of substance to improve your actual trading. I would not say don't buy the book because it opens your mind to the fact that you can become a good trader. Becoming a money maker is about a winning system and you will not get it here. You have to learn the rules to the game and these are not them."
3,Ok,"Another psycho analysis book on trading, this one is actually applicable to non trading psychology. I especially liked the chapter on ""Emotions"", as many of it made sense to me and could possibly be applicable. However, the book is nothing special otherwise."
2,Interesting...for about 2 minutes,"It's not a bad puzzle per se. It's just it took me all of 2 minutes to figure out the solution. When I bought it I wasn't sure what the ""trick"" was. There's no hidden switch or moving parts. It's just a normal (other than the color) ping pong ball in a plastic container. The objective is to get the ball out of the container without touching it (or presumably turning the container on its side or upside down). It was only $5 so no big loss, but I only got about $1 worth of amusement out of it. It's rated ages 8 and up, but it probably should be rated ages 7-12 since anyone much over that age will probably figure it out pretty quickly."
3,Great but ceramic breaks easy,The crockpot works great but the ceramic parts like the handles and the lid knob break easy. You have to be real careful when washing and handling.
1,Poor Design,"I purchased 2 a 6qt & a 5qt, seemed like a good idea. Wrong! Hot, heavy, poor design on lid it defies using a pot holder and breaks very easily. Experience speaking!!"
4,Finally a crockpot that can go anywhere.,I love this crockpot!!! It is the perfect size for the 6 of us. Handles make it very nice to transport. Easy to clean. My only complaint is the lid. It tends to fall in if it is not placed just right. I am afraid it will break at some point. Otherwise I am very pleased with all of its features.
4,"Large Capacity, but hard to clean","Generally, I like my VersaWare crockpot. It is large, and I can feed my whole family plus a few extra kids with it. I love that I can brown the meat or onions right on the stovetop in the pot, and then put it in the base unit. It saves me from cleaning up a skillet or dutch oven. I have not used the insert in te regular oven b/c I really don't need to. I have lots of other beautiful pots and pans for the stove and oven.My only complaint is that it is hard to clean. I usually soak it for a fewhours before I can get it clean. But, I like how it looks and have been happy with how it heats up. I feel comfortable leaving it on low all day. On high, it will boil."
2,"Good Looks, Poor Execution","This unit got lots of approving looks for its design, but just wait until you use it! The top fit poorly and eventually slid off on the floor and broke. We have not found a replacement, yet. The pot itself is not non-stick and has several ridges and creases which trap food. With the poorly fitting lid, food dries out over long cooking times. We are very disappointed with this item."
3,Good while it lasted,"We bought it in November 2005 and it lasted until January 2007 with regular use. My wife had just finished hand washing the VersaWare and started to lift it out of the sink when both handles broke off. Luckily, she wasn't hurt and no other dishes were broken."
2,Not what I wanted,"With the heater unit on the bottom, this slow cooker doesn't cook as well as a heater unit enveloping the cooking dish."
2,doesn't last,"we bought this crockpot and it was a very short time before one of the handles broke off. then the pot cracked while cooking with it on the stovetop. it was great when we could use it....heats up well but we've tried to find replacement parts for it for over a year and the company keeps saying they're out of stock and don't know when they'll get more in. They want us to keep calling back every two weeks. So the time I'd save using a crockpot, I now have to spend calling the company? I don't think so."
5,a great pot,"I have used this pot 3 times so far and really love it. It has a great design, and it's easy to use. I haven't had a single problem with the pot, but I have been using crock pots for years now. Using a spray oil like PAM prior to cooking will prevent the burning and sticking, and I have had no problems with the overcooking. It does boil on high, but I never fill it so full that it would boil over. It is a heavy pot, but I would expect that from this material. The shape is nice and will accomodate a roast well. Hands down better than the last pot I had. I did a lot of checking around prior to purchasing this pot and found the complaints you hear about crock pots are the same everywhere. Either too heavy, handles get too hot, not enough temp settings, overcooks, uneven cooking, you name it. There is nothing perfect out there for every need, but I couldn't be happier with this one."
2,The handle broke off,"I love the look of the pot and all the features, however when it was being wash after the first use the handle broke off. I will be sending it back and looking from a differant slow cooker."
2,"""Burned wired"" smell does not go off","The specs of this slow cooker was ideal for my wife, so I happily bought one for her.However, she said the cooker had a ""burned wire"" smell. After verifying there was nothing unsafe, I noticed there is a black plastic cover on top of the heating unit. This area would get very hot, and I can only assume the burned smell came from there. I returned my unit and exchanged for another in hope I could get one without this problem, but it also had that ""burned wire"" smell....This is a wonderful product, but very poorly designed and manufactured. If you can live with bad smell (what is tough, since this thing is supposed to be on for a very long time), then I would recommend this product. Otherwise, stay away and buy from another manufacturer."
1,What a mistake !,"The lid drops in half the time you're trying to put it on. The first six meals or so smell ""bad"" (spoiled)as they are cooking.. I think it's the sealing ring ! What a God-awful smell for a kitchen !"
3,Versaware is versatile,"I've used this crock pot several times and it much more versatile than a standard crock pot. Having the ability to brown food is wonderful, even though it's not quite as big as a rosting pan so it can be a tight squeeze for larger items.The only big fault with this is the odor it puts out that pervades the house. I've checked the unit and don't see anything wrong with it, but it aways has a funky smell. Another reviewed called it a ""burnt wire smell"". It's pretty bad, that my daughter doesn't want to try the food when she smells it.Otherwise, it's a sturdy crock."
1,Didn't last,"Not cool. I am so sick of companies making junk, this is a very expensive item on my budget and it only lasted through 3 uses. Just washing it one day and the handle broke off causing it to fall into my sink and crack. Yippie! Emailed the company and they said they don't have a new one to send me right now, now I'm back to using my itty bitty crock pot with my family of 7. Save your dough."
5,EXCELLENT FOLLOW-UP,"THIS 2ND SET IS SUPERIOR THAN THE 1ST SET AS WE AGAIN FOLLOW THE EXCITING,DRAMATIC AND HUMOROUS ADVENTURES OF THIS PAIR OF ""CO-INHABITORS"". CAN'T WAIT TO VIEW FINAL SET."
5,Celtic Rain,"I`ve heard this album for the first time more than 10 years before and still it charms me. Music played by William and Steve Coulter, Shelley and Barry Phillips is healing and soothing cure.I think that ""Morning Rain"" by William Coulter is one of the best contemporary music pieces for acoustic guitar. Pure and perfect beauty. You could buy the album only because of this track. You could feel the texture of the sound of acoustic instruments while listening to this record.By the way, if you like folk side of Mike Oldfield`s works (as example, ""Voyager"") - you would like this album.And I don`t want to stress on the Celtic style of this record, because it is simply one of the best albums of contemporary instrumental folk music."
3,Alice Walker but not the Best Alice Walker,"By the Light of My Father's Smile is qintessential Alice Walker; that is, the book examines what is wrong with a particular world, offers a solution for repairing that world and making that world more inhabitable for everyone in it. The book illustrates a shift in Walker's artistry. Although,Walker continues to examine intergenerational relationships, she centers this narrative in the spiritual rather than the earthly. What her work illustrates and what Walker herself advocates is that we are too much in the world and not with the world. We are immune to the messages that the moon, the sun, the stars, the earth and the greater spirit send us. Walker's novel offers a look at the world from the perspective of not being in it at all and discovering what we failed to look at and enjoy. It is a pleasant read but the characters are underdeveloped."
3,A spiritual adventure,"Frankly, this kind of book isn't the type I usually read, but I loved the title. If you like novels that read like poems with lots of talk about death and ""the great beyond,"" maybe this story is for you. It left me feeling rather depressed. With the possible exception of the dwarf lady in the church, there were no sympathetic characters. I guess I should've expected that from the woman who wrote ""The Color Purple."""
2,New Age claptrap,"A confusing blend of New Age sermonizing and the predictable ""womanism"". Strictly for those who can't get enough of Walker's ""message""."
1,Will put you to sleep better than a glass of warm milk.,"It is important to read a book like this every once in a while so that you have something to compare good literature against. Having never read any other books by the author this one certainly does nothing to encourage me to view her previous works. I found the writing amaturish at best, and irritating for the most part. I found it neither thought provoking nor interesting but mostly just boring. Spare me from writers who try so hard to instill an air of self importance that they forget to tell their story well or make their characters even a little bit believable."
3,By the light of my father's voyeurism,"I'll confess my disappointment in Alice Walker's the Color Purple which I found to be a movie ""treatment"" to be shopped around Hollywood. So I was unwilling to go back to her works until a friend insisted that I read this book. Well, her male narrator's voice certainly sounded like a woman and probably the author. Its not an authentic male voice. Maybe dead men sound like this but I hope not. She has set forth an agenda that contains spiritualism and philosophy. From the sparseness of the CoP to the extra words of this piece. I have the impression that she had a Thesaurus in her PC working overtime to place an extra adjective in every sentence. She has confirmed my suspicion that she is a mediocre writer at the same time she has convinced me that she is not a good storyteller either. The novel has its moments but they are isolated oases amid a desert of a half baked spirtitualism. The three stars are for effort."
4,Trust Walker's Spirit enough to see/walk thru' her Mind.,"I view Alice Walker's individual works as part of a continuing Life Conversation; one that I count myself lucky enough to be able to share. Therefore, when she takes-up another thread of feminine assertive thought, woven on this occasion thru' the colourful but necessarily complex tapestry of Mundo-life in her latest work: ""By the Light of My Father's Smile"" I am with her all the way in the essential comprehension of the tale. As with all great conversations (even the decidedly ""one-sided"" ones, as in this case!) every single idea that is thrown into the thought-pool does not necessarily float, but, secure in the knowledge that the orator is who She is, you either nod and smile in friendly indulgence, or draw your chair closer. With this book, as with every other Walker-work, the chair was constantly on the move."
4,SMILE HAS SOUL.,"I had never been a fan of Alice Walker's novels till a Native American friend told me about this one. With reservation, I began reading SMILE and was soon transported by the spirituality of the Mundos. They awakened something deep in my soul that was akin to what I felt when I read WALKING THE TRAIL/ONE MAN'S JOURNEY ALONG THE CHEROKEE TRAIL OF TEARS. Keep it up, Ms. Walker. You're a feast for those of us who hunger for what WalMart doesn't have on its shelves.."
4,Pure Passion and Poetry,"My third Alice Walker book, and I was surprised by how much I loved it. Better than Temple of My Familiar and as engrossing as The Color Purple, I found myself on a sensual journey, guided by pained characters who became enlightened along the journey as well. Walker writes with poetic fluidity. Her talent is admirable, to say the least, and I finish the book with a desire to read more of her works."
5,finally,"Nintendo finally releases something that can make the best thing on earth even better, a way to charge the SP up while driving to work.... YAY for them."
4,GOOD READING ON FISH ECOLOGY,"This is an interesting, and very readable study of the problems that have caused major declines within the New England groundfishing industry, and how 2 seperate, but equally interested parties can view a subject so differently. It presents the case in a middle of the road view and throws the blame for the problem at both groups. If you ever wondered why the price of fish has become prohibitive, or how a major eco-system can be destroted while everyone talks, this is a book well worth reading. It is written in language that non-scientitsts can understand and enjoy."
2,Not My Idea of Sherlock Holmes,"I was surprised when I saw how high the avarage customer rating was for this DVD. Then I thought, maybe it is a cult favorite among people who like campy, bad acting. But, after reading the reviews, I see that a lot of people really like it.So, why didn't I like it? I thought the way Jeremy Brett plays Sherlock Homes was too strange. I know Holmes is meant to be eccentric, but the way Brett speaks is too choppy, kind of angry, and annoying to me. It seemed very affected and unnatural. Dr. Watwon comes off as really dopey.The scenery and sets were good, most of the other actors were good, but this was not my idea of how Sherlock Holmes should be done."
5,Brett = Holmes,Jeremy Brett is superb has Holmes. I think even Basil Rathbone would have to admit this (if he were still with us). The Crooked Man is a little slow with not must mystery but the acting is excellent. The Speckled Band is true to form. Not as many episodes as the first collection but oh well.
5,Great Buy!,I have had the mp3 player for over a month. I use it when I work out and have had no problems with it. The arm band is the best accessory i've found!
2,great while it lasted,"I got this just for walking at the park, so didn't expect much but it died after a few weeks. It stopped working and would only shut off when I removed the battery. When I hooked it up to the computer again it didn't recognize it at all. While it worked it was great--easy to use, easy to load songs (I fit about 60)."
3,Missing a page,"It presents noun declension well, making an interesting distinction between nonfeminine, nonneuter, and feminine. It is unfortunate that none of the words have English glosses. It was also missing a page."
3,Good book,This is a good book by Audrey Wood. I don't think it is one of her best but it is a cute story.
5,Good Reliable Readings,This monitor seems to provide accurate readings and is easy to use. It has ample memory. A quality product.
1,inaccurate readings,Great price at Costco - less than $[...]. But what good is it if the readings are not accurate. Diastolic about 10 points lower than actual doctor's office measurements. My doctor said to get an Omron and I subsequently did. Also at Costco - $[...] It is perfect.Re Microlife - very hard to get the cuff on as they want you to wear it.Small cuff was too small. Large cuff was too large.Every time I moved the unit I accidentally turned on the cuff.
1,Not the best book on the shelf,"I used this book in a Course of Study class at Claremont School of Theology. However, I have taught most or all of the precepts that Mr. Savage would have you think are his own but have been in numerous other books and publications since I was in graduate school in the middle 70's. While the ideas are good, his presentation leaves many holes in the concepts and is not nearly as thorough as it should be. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is serious about counseling at anytime. There are many, many books on the market that are much better."
4,Listening Has Awesome Power,"I first met John Savage in Sydney Australia when he led a workshop on ""Story Listening"" It was a brilliant time spent with him.Now fortunately Savage has published an excellent book which is a must for anyone involved in councelling & ministry.What is particulary helpful is the section on ""Types of Stories"" where the author writes about Reinvestment stories,Rehearsel stories,Anniversary stories & Transition stories.These are stories told frequently as we listen to others.The book is very practical & clearly set out."
4,Listening for the Story,"I keep returning to the skills I learned from this book, especially listening for metaphors in stories and dealing with criticism or hostile comments. The advice is applicable to counselors from a wide variety of religious traditions."
5,I got what I ordered & paid for,"I have not read this book cover to cover yet, however I have browsed through it. I will be using it as resource to build retreats and group activities."
2,"Excellent info, badly executed","The author's ideas are useful and well-presented--but the Kindle edition has lots of errors, some of which even alter the sense of the sentence. Our technology isn't advanced enough to do the OCR without proofing the output, and a spell checker will not suffice. This is a perfect example of why proofreaders are still needed. Very disappointed, I returned the Kindle edition and will buy a print copy for my library."
5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book by an excellent author. Kreeft clearly, concisely, and charitably explains various doctrines of the Faith. He looks at the arguments for the existence of God, looks at the creeds, the Our Father line by line with great explanations, the last things, the Trinity, and many other things. Each essay is 10-20 pages long and eminently readable in short bits of time. For a great explanation of what C.S. Lewis called ""Mere Christianity"", read this book."
5,Greater Than the Sum of its Parts,"Kreeft has done it again. He has written a book that cuts through the murk and is useful for the committed atheist and the committed Catholic alike. The title is a little misleading: this book is not a bunch of essays, but a very organic whole. He starts from the very beginning, as did Thomas in the Summa and should every text on Theology, by defending the existence of God. He writes polemically, but without animosity; passionately, but without attacking the opposition; he writes to convince, not to shout down. The last thing this work is is a string of abstruse terms and esoteric reasoning. It is a work that anyone who sincerely searches for truth will profit from."
5,required to must-have,i purchased this book because i needed it for class. we only read a few chapters of it but i really liked it so i plan to read the rest of the book when i get a chance. would recommend it to anyone who is struggling with their faith to those who just want to make their faith stronger.
2,Not the best option,"If you are trying to avoid wheat or gluten, this book is not the best choice. The recipes appear to be designed using wheat flour, with gluten-free substitutions listed below each. If you have any experience with gluten-free baking, you know that simply substituting a different kind of flour is often not enough. So far, the recipes I have tried have not turned out very well, and I have had more luck adapting old recipes that are not intended for people with food allergies. This book might be helpful if you are just starting out trying to provide foods for a child with food allergies, and are having trouble coming up with ideas. Otherwise, your money would be better spent on a book by Bette Hagman or Carol Fenster."
1,Nothing Special,"I found nothing special about this book, to say the least. I am the mother of two children with multiple food allergies. My theory on cookbooks is that if I can get one good recipe or idea from it, then it was worth the money. I buy a lot of cookbooks, and this was the only cookbook I have ever returned."
4,Helpful,"While this book is not exactly what I was looking for because my child is on a rotary/rotation diet, it's a good resource for parents with children allergic or sensitive to wheat and/or gluten, milk and/or eggs. There are substitutions given for each of these as needed for every recipe, conveniently located on the same page."
1,This cookbook sucks for multiple food allergies....,"The format of this book is aweful. Essentially what they've done is to write normal recipes and then list the substitutions at the bottom. I can do this without their help. What I wanted was a thoughtful well written and kitchen tested set of recipes that worked for mulitple food allergies. I made the chocolate chip cookies using their substitutions for wheat, milk and eggs, ""baked sand castle bars"" would have been a better name for them. If I'm going to eat a gritty cookie, it better come with a prize like a diamond or an orgasim. Nobody who tasted that recipe would have ever published it."
5,"Great Recipes, Fun to make!","My son has a severe allergy to eggs, dairy, peanuts and tree nuts and now the possibility of celiac disease has been established. I am always on the look out for new recipes that are easy, fun, and have reasonable substitutes. I love this book, the recipes are great, my son can help me make a lot of what I have found in this and I don't have to empty the bank just to satisfy the ingredient lists!! It is tough to expand my son's menu when he has so many allergies to foods that are in EVERYTHING but this is one of the better cook books I have found. I HIGHLY recommend this to parents of allergic children or even families looking for fun recipes to make together."
5,Excellent kid-friendly cookbook,"My 4 year old son has had diagnosed food allergies since he was 8 months old. It's been hard to find a great cookbook that has good, kid-friendly recipes along with ones that taste good for the whole family and are easy to make. This book is filled with great, common place recipes like cookies, cupcakes, muffins, corndogs, fun snacks, etc... Out of all the books I've used (and there have been many!) this is by far the best one I've purchased!"
4,v thought-provoking,truth be told i only read this because i heard the harry potter kid is/was doing the play in london.wish i couldve read it as part of a book club or class..
4,my opinion on equus!,i think it is a fascinating play as it looks at lots of aspects and i think its gr8 as it shows how alan strang has 2 different religions because of his parents.i recommoned the book although it is disturbing 2 a certain extent although i would most definitly not recommond the film a definite no no!!!!!
3,Interesting..,"I liked the themes of this play but I had found that the way that the play was written was jarring to the themes. It was in a sense; confusing. I loved themes, hate how it was excuted."
5,Simply Profound,"Truth be told, I got interested in the play because of Dan Radcliffe. Initially, the plot descriptions I had read didn't interest me that much. However, curiousity prevailed, and I am so grateful that I bought it.It is an extremely thought provoking drama detailing the story of a therapist and his patient. Under close scrutiny, it brings to light the darker and more mysterious aspects of the human psyche, ethics, and the effects that parents could possibly have on their children.I have only had the play for two weeks, and I have read it many times over. It is easy to read, yet the mental images it gives to the reader are astounding. I thoroughly recommend this book for ANYONE who enjoys theatre, particularly drama that has more beyond it's surface. This is a play that will stand up with the best of of them. From ""The Glass Menagerie"" by Tennessee Williams to ""Tartuffe"" by Jean Baptiste Moliere, this is a play worth reading and performing over and over again."
2,Interesting play,A very strange play. That's about all I can say to sum this play up. Very strange and disturbing.
5,wow.,"I am seventeen years old and in college,and I saw Equus when I was fiveteen.It is still one of the most amazing pieces of modern performing art I have seen. Thankyou Mr.Shaffer for giving us such a magnificant play. Charlotte"
4,A Powerful Play,"Equus is a powerful play dealing with a myriad of issues including psychiatry, love, crime, insanity and family in a compact and readable manner. Even though the play deals with so many complex issues, it is eminently readable, one might even say a page-turner. A final note of interest: the playwright tells us in his introduction that the plot of the play came from a newspaper headline he saw describing a particularly bizarre crime. Although the author never learned anything more about the crime, the headline sparked his imagination. The play, therefore, also serves as an intriguing study of the playwright's own imagination."
2,"Uses too much verbage; and, beats around the bush.","The author includes a quote about two men: one knows what to say but doesn't know how to say it; the other knows how to say it, but has nothing to say. I find him guilty of the former. A classic example of academic verbage when a more simple vocabulary and a more direct approach would have been helpful. I remember hearing a sermon much like this book one Sunday; and, as I was leaving the Church a man in front of me said: ""Pastor, when I come to Church, I deserve to be shot at and hit."" If he had dumbed it up, the book could have been half as long and more interesting to read. I'm surprised Fred Craddock was not more critical in his foreward to the book; I think he was being kind to a fellow colleage. I don't really recommend the book."
4,Roll-a lotion,"My elderly mother had used this product and found it helpful. A fellow resident in her senior apt bldg, who has been a good friend to her, had admired it so I bought one as a gift to her. She has found it helpful also."
4,interesting look into islamic woman's life and fight,"fabulous book, not only beautifully written but also helps to see Islamic women in a new light..."
1,A terrible book that fails to appreciate the understandin Africa,"This book is nothing more than a pathetic and inconsistent rant about the minor troubles of a Muslim African woman. It truly fails to incorporate the real pain many extreme Muslim women feel, or the unbelievable suffering Africa is undergoing."
3,An Astronaut Photographic Reference,"This book is intended for libraries and was published in 1970, so is now rather difficult to find. It is essentially a photographic history of the early manned space program through Apollo 13. It contains a brief (two pages or so) historical abstract of Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo and loads of black and white photos. Most of these photos have been seen before, but there are a few that were new to me. There are a few pages of color as well, and a useful glossary and index. Possibly the most useful feature of the book are the brief astronaut biographies in the back of the book, which include even the later scientist-astronauts who flew on Skylab (and of course Jack Schmitt, who flew on Apollo 17.)This is a great books for introducing kids to the early space program (probably junior high school and older) and has some valuable photographs. Don't expect much serious historical writing here, though; it is mainly a picture book."
1,Arrgh!!! Is this a demo?,"Saw him play in Dallas and bought a cd.Biggest waste of money I ever spent,I should have saved my money for more beer.It sounds like a bad demo,The overall vocal mix is too loud and the drums and bass barely come through at all.The guitar sounds like a bad 80's [copy] of the band Winger with alot less talent in the structure of the songs.The mixing and engineering of this cd was really bad.I would not recomend this cd,I would spend money on a 12 pack of beer instead.It would last you alot longer because I dont think its worth a second listen."
1,Everything to Lose,"I aggree with most of the below reviews.This CD is an embaressment for the artist because of the overall sound.Whoever engineered this CD should get out of the buissness.I have seen Jake play and he is great live but cant bring his sound out on studio recordings.I heard his other CD and its not good either.Not slamming Jake,Maybe he should just release a live CD.Cant stand to listen to this cd again just because of the bad quality sound.It does sound like a bad demo.I could most likely make a better recording on a 4 track,or maybe thats what he did.I dont know but You have alot to Lose if you buy this CD."
3,Talent Excellent/Recording So-So,"I can not imagine someone (earlier review) bought this cd without seeing the young Mr. Crawford in action first. To see the man live is amazing....an old soul in a young man's body - the music just flows from his fingertips. The recording is not the best, but if this is the first recording for The Jake Crawford Band, then I will stick around to see the next and give the talent a chance to shine through. I think maybe someone disenchanted with the local music community may have been a little jealous of the talent. I think song samples are on the band website, so I am headed there now."
3,Eh,"Okay, let me be honest for a moment. I'm an English Major, but that's not English Education major. So I don't like the idea of having to take Advanced Comp for Teachers II. Still, I'm treating it with the respect I would any class I need to take. That said this isn't the best book. Ede proves she has a firm grip on composition, but she name drops more than anything else. Most of the book is fill with what seems like filler. It's not the best text book I've ever read. That said... Eh, it could be worse."
2,Not very useful,"These Focus Notes don't provide any additional material beyond what Wiley's CPA review books have. Also, it seems like they overly abbreviate material sometimes in order to fit it on one page. At times, the organization of the information is confusing. Moreover, this is somewhat of an awkward format to work with - no wonder there aren't very many books out there with spiral binding at the top of the page.The whole point of Wiley books is that they're cheaper than the books you'd get with a review course. Yet, you can get a set of Becker flashcards off eBay for the price of these Focus Notes. I'd go with the flashcards."
5,Good book!,"This author is well researched with the scriptures, and understands the gospel of Jesus Christ very well. We can learn a lot about this life and the life to come, by reading this book, and others similar."
5,Increasing our faith in Christ and in the afterlife,"Loved this book.The Life Beyond carefully uses the scriptures and the teachings of ancient and modern prophets to outline what is known about the life after death. It is very interesting, well researched, and inspiring. It comforts those who have lost loved ones, including little children.It teaches so many great things: for example, one of my favorite stories in the book is about a man, Brother Vest, who died during Oscar McConkie's mission, who President McConkie learned in a vision would teach the gospel to thousands and thousands of his fellow Lamanites in the spirit world. The details included there taught that there is great liveliness in those who dwell in the spirit world. Wow-- the extent to which they are still themselves, even to the details of their tribal cultures-- I appreciate these stories.Great book, written with love. Reading it will increase a reader's faith in Christ and decrease his/her fear of death."
5,A really lovely brew,"I had never heard of English Afternoon tea until I ordered an array of teas to enjoy this Fall and Winter. This is not a brisk, strong tea at all but very satisfying, nonetheless. It has a mellow flavor while retaining the basic character of black teas that I enjoy so much. I will be reordering when supply begins to dwindle. Friends and coworkers have been pleased when I share, too."
3,Not bad,"This afternoon tea is less fruity than other, higher-priced afternoon teas I've tried. Like some other Twinings products (Darjeeling), it's not super high-quality, but it's a good value for the price."
4,Aptly named,"A nice, medium-strength blended black tea. (Not as strong as 'breakfast' teas.) As the name suggests, this IS good in the afternoon, perhaps with a slice of fruitcake or with a lunch of a turkey and provolone sandwich.I drink it black, either with or without food; however, since I do prefer it with food, I probably should try it with milk and sugar, as suggested in the product description. I'm not an iced-tea drinker, so I can't speak to that.I'd never heard of this blend before seeing it on Amazon. I can't always find Twinings, but this was a better unit price than when I do find Twinings of any kind. Aside from helping to preserve flavor, the individual-bag packaging also makes it handy for adding to a gift basket or tucking into a birthday card, especially since it's a somewhat unusual blend.I didn't give this the highest rating simply because there are other brands (Jackson's; F&M;) and blends that I like better than this one, but this is still a very nice tea."
5,A sweet beautiful retelling of a fairy tale just for women who love women,"Enjoyed this sweet tale of beauty and the beast redone as a lesbian fairytale more than i'd imagined i would. A quick read you can knock off in a day if you are keen enough, and you will be because the story quickly pulls you in and doesn't let go. Beautiful, full characters well fleshed out will have you believing in you're own happily ever after. Don't pass this one by, you seriously will not be disappointed!"
3,Cute re-write,"This is a cute re-write of a fairy tale classic. I think the author could have done a bit more with the characters and plot, but it was a fun, quick read."
5,One of the best lesbian love stories I've ever read,"I am so enchanted by what the author did with the story of Beauty and the Beast--the cloaked, guarded Drew, the open-hearted and open-minded Angelique, and the delicate dance that eventually brings the two together is truly magickal. This is a love story that will stick with you long after you've closed the book. This novel will always be in my library. I love this story; it truly is spellbinding."
1,Extremely Disturbed and Pissed!,"If i could, there'd be absolutly NO stars!! ... I don't even know where to begin.. I bought this book because Beauty and the Beast is one of my all time favorite tales, half way into reading it I realize something is wrong... EXTREMELY MISS-LEADING!! It should be written in the description in bold letters that this is a LESBIAN version! I was incredibly disturbed and disgusted! I had to just trow it in the trash. It ruined my favorite tale and ive never been so pissed! >:( what a waste of my time and money. What a way to destroy a beautiful classic story, such garbage. NOT and will NEVER be recommended."
2,Not for more sensitive breeds of cats,"If my cat could talk, his review of this product would be ""YUK."" It's a gamble, depending upon your breed. I'm going back to Hartz chewable multi-vitamins."
5,KC-135....the jet that will outlive anything else flying!,"When it comes to a true iron horse for the USAF, then that honor goes to the KC-135, it's the kind of aircraft that made all those long range missions possible, wether you fly a fighter, a transport, or bomber, with a KC-135 you could always count on the tankers and the crews that flew them.If you want to know the history of this fantastic jet, no home aircraft libray should be without this book, depending on the mission needing flown, from the ""Plain Jane Tankers"" and recon missions of the Raven RC-135's, this book has what you need to appericate what USAF did to fly.For the aircraft buff like myself, this one book you ought to have!"
5,Everything you wanted to know about the Boeing KC-135,"""Dr. Bob"" is a popular speaker at many military functions in the Omaha area. This comprehensive work is an opportunity for his talents as an academic, as well as somone who's ""been there"" in the cockpit, to shine. Lots of technical details as well as interesting history of each K/E/RC-135"
4,GOOD STUFF!,"Although there is nothing groundbreaking on this album, it's still a solid release from The Rods....it's your standard issue early 80's metal....and I don't mean that in a bad way at all! This album (as do other Rods releases) stands up well next to anything Saxon, Priest, Manowar or Maiden put out during the same time period. It's a solid record that brings you back to the days when metal was trying to gain a foothold in America, when metal was metal and there wer no crazy sub-genres! If you like the classic metal sound or you want to check out metals history, buy this record...it will not dissapoint you and will bring a smile to your face!"
3,okay,It was an interest book and different reading but it was a good story but I was not crazy over it!
2,Hard to see screen and Cingular tries to steal your money,"The phone is actually a disappointment. The color screen is VERY hard to read outdoors and even indoors unless the lighting is dim. The rings are too quiet - even at the maximum setting. Other than that, the phone is OK.Cingular plays the stealth service plan game - they tried to tack on 'roadside assistance' plan (I never agreed to such a plan) and had the nerve to say that removing the plan was a courtesy. They also failed to apply my govt employee discount"
3,"Good basic phone, excellent reception","Pro: Just a good basic ""stick"" phone like everyone else is saying, and it has great battery life (at least mine does), and a nice user interface -- easy to setup the address book. I'd buy it again.Con: (1) Very ""hot"" magnetically -- will make LOUD pops, hums, chirps and squeals on any nearby powered speakers (hey -- you can tell when a call is coming in!), will jiggle nearby CRT monitors. Much more than any other phone I've owned. It's like it's really trying hard to reach out!(2) Display very hard to read in ambient light -- and you have to push a button to bring up the back-light, then ""undo"" whatever you did by pushing the button. This phone does NOT need a color display -- my LCD wristwatch is easily readable in most any light, but not this phone!(3) Buttons not well placed -- especially the upper two ""soft"" buttons."
4,Amazing Little Phone,"With all of these owners and their new-fangled cell phones with their bells and whistles on them, many people are pretty surprised to see me pull out this antique (in terms of cell phone technology anyway). No special screen. No picture capabilities. Just a Plain-Jane ol' cell phone. Yep. Suits me just fine.I get great reception. A great basic service plan. And I still have the original battery in this sucker! Can you believe that? Most people can't. But it's true. I swear! I've dropped it about half-a-dozen times, too, but it just keeps on working. Amazing little guys. My little snoogy phone. Yes...my itty-bitty, little snoogy phone. I love you snoogy phone. Yes I do. I love you..."
5,Best stereo ever,"This bluetooth car stereo is awesome! Works better than the stereo in our Ford Edge and the bluetooth sounds clear. If you dont have one, get one! Also easy to intall and has an awesome look to it."
5,Awesome stereo at an awesome price,"I am not one to leave reviews for stuff very often but this little stereo has blown me away. If you are the least bit techy you will love it. USB/SD on the front and an aux port. On top of that the built-in bluetooth is killer. I paired it up with my blackberry 8830 and it works like a champ. My wife calls me 10000000+ times on my ride home from work and now I don't have to fumble around with stupid star-trek like earpeices or a sub-par speakerphone. There are a ton of nice little add-ons that you normally wouldn't expect from a radio at this price. The external mic. for example is great. In addition, they include an aux cable for you (Saves a few bucks and a headache). I am thoroughly impressed. Quality product and you can't beat the price. BUY ONE TODAY!!!"
3,Big product low Support,"UI just buy and install my radio couple of weeks ago, it works great, sound (music and phone) quality is great, all functions work fine, using the internal mic the call quality is good enough but using the additional mic the quality improves a lot. It only support a 1MB SD card but it works ok with my 2MB SDBut my device have a great issue, any time I detach the front panel is restart to fabric default when I connected it again, I lost all the configuration so I have to start all over again (except the Bluetooth). I send a mail to VR3 support team but they never respond I'm still trying to fix this problem"
5,timeless!,"There is nothing like an old "" I love Lucy"" show. They are just as funny now as they were then."
3,TV Show Freezes,"Although I love Lucy, it's one of my all time favorites, the show always freezes! Sometimes I don't get a picture until the next day! It's very frustrating! So I love Lucy, I just don't like the constant interruptions."
5,I Love Lucy Volume !,"It is fantastic to see Lucy and the gang in HD. I love crawling into bed every night and watching another episode of I Love Lucy. It's so wonderful to be able to see the characters clearly and to pick and choose which episodes I'd like to watch without commercial interruption. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves a silly, imaginative housewife who always seems to get herself into trouble, but always finds a happy ending. I love Lucy!"
5,Classic good humor,"This is a timeless classic that I never get tired of seeing. The creativity and talent in this group of four actors is always entertaining. Grateful for their hard work! Some times tv can be a positive influence on their audience. Writers should always keep the standard high, even if the network doesn't require it."
3,lacking,"This is what the editors consider the ""best"" of season one episodes. However, you can just buy the whole season instead. Here's the problem with instant videos - there is no bonus features, which for a classic TV show like Lucy, you definitely need the extras. Also, as stated, if you buy the whole season it's $14.99, but be warn, it's not the complete season one, instead it's episodes that whoever feels is the ""best"" of I Love Lucy's season one. Now, that seems ridiculous to me, because you can get the complete season one box set with bonus features for the same price - so why the hell would anyone get this!?"
4,The ending of this book took me totally by surprise.,"As a teacher, I am always looking for new stories to share with my students. This one is wonderful and full of the emotions that children find it so hard to express in words. I can hardly wait to read this book with my students."
5,A really good book! !,"This book was a great book,there are so manny things to think about.Like what if you where in Little Willy's place.If you go to the library check this book out.It is good for all ages to.Everything has a reason for happening.if you get a chance to read this one would be a good one to read."
4,Fabulous,"The race was going to start.The crowd was cheering. When the mayor started to speak, the cheering stopped. There was a big silence.The race was just going to start. BANG!!! the race begun, little Willy was in the lead. The other racers had to slow down for a curve but little Willy didn't have to.WILL LITTLE WILLY WIN THE RACE????IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"
4,World of Dogs,Little Willy lives on a farm with his Grandfather and his dog Searchlight. Little Willy was having a good time until one day Grandfather became very ill. A few days later a tax collector came and told them that Willy's Grandfather hadn't been paying his taxes. Little Willy went into town to buy Grandfather some medicine. Then he saw it.ANNUAL DOG-SLED RACEADMISSON PRICE: $50.00PRIZE MONEY: $500.00Will this be the answer to his problem?
4,STONE FOX,"I liked the race.Willy entered a race to save the farm, but he entered with the undefeated champ, Stone Fox.Willy started in the lead with Stone Fox in last place, but after half of the race Stone Fox was passing people fast. He had just caught up to Willy. See who wins in the book Stone Fox."
4,Sensationly Sad,"Little Willy lives om a farm with his grand father and his dog Search Light. His grand father got sick, but little Wiily still had hope. One day a city slicker came to there door step saying they owed some money. Little Willy did not understand grand father had paid every bill and so had he. If he didnot pay it fast he might lose the farm!! But his worries were over. He saw a sign which said dog sled race. Willy entered it. Will he be able to win the prize and pay the bills?????"
3,Best Book,"The book Stone Fox, by John Reynolds Gardiner, is a good book. It is about a kid who goes in race with a champion sleigh racer. He tries to earn 500 dollars. In the race you can have as many dogs as you want, but Willie only has one dog. His dog, Searchlight, is brave and strong. I don't want to give the ending away, so I will recommend this book for people who like action books."
3,Stone Fox -_- ***,"This book is about Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardner. I liked this book. I gave three stars to this book because it is a sad book. I like happy endings. The main characters are Willy, Willy's grandpa, and an Indian named Stone Fox. This book is about Willy's grandpa who owns a potato farm and gets sick because he owes $500 in taxes. Then Willy sees a poster about a dogsled race. He would never lose with Searchlight his dog. The ending is really sad. I think Stone Fox did a sweet thing. I would recommend this book to my big brother."
3,Stone Fox,"I gave this book 3 stars because at the end it made me almost start crying. I love animals. This book was about a boy named Little Willy. Little Willy had a dog named Searchlight. Their farm had gone broke and they needed to pay their taxes. It was $500.00 to pay them. Little Willy had entered himself and Searchlight into a big sled race. There was a man named Stone Fox, he had never lost in a sled dog race before. Stone Fox was an Indian. Your going to have to read and find out what happens at the end."
5,Full of sadness and happiness,"This book is about life -- life is not perfect. A child sets out to achieve the seemingly impossible, and he doesn't get much help, support, or encouragement. His goal keeps driving him forward, that plus the love and joy between himself and his dog, Searchlight.The surprise ending is bittersweet. We all cried at the finish line.The adult problems -- depression, debt, and fear -- are simplified. Very young readers can kind of bypass the implications of all that adult stuff. The child character -- Little Willy -- has struggles of his own, which come through loud and clear.The implacable burden of heavy taxation comes through, too -- here comes the tax man.I read this out loud to my family of boys. We enjoyed it very much. Every chapter has at least one sketched illustration.If your older kids are interested in this topic -- a child helping a stricken parent and meeting difficult goals -- try ""The Barn"" by Avi."

2,Stone Fox,"I kind of liked the book, Stone Fox by John Reynolds, because I liked that little Willy wanted to save his grandpa. My favorite character was little Willy because he was the main character. He was a caring character in the book. I think the story is good because the end was really sad. I would recommend this to anyone who likes sad stories and a little action."
2,Searchlight favorite character,"The book I read was Stone Fox, by John Reynolds Gardiner. This book is about a kid named Willy. Willy lived on a farm with his grandpa. But his grandpa starts to die because he owes too much money. There is not much action in this book. This book's ending is very sad. I would not recommend this book to a person who likes action books."
