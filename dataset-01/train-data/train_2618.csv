3,An uneven transitional effort,"""The Passion of Anna"" forms a bridge between Bergman's great ""couples battling adversity"" films of the mid-1960s (insanity in ""Hour of the Wolf""; war in ""Shame"") and the more intimate, personal struggles of ""Cries and Whispers"" and ""Scenes from a Marriage."" Largely due to its nature as a transitional film, ""Passion"" often lacks focus. It can't seem to make up its mind whether it's about relationships or external hardships, and in trying to deal with both areas, the film ultimately covers neither one especially well. The subplot with Bibi Andersson feels undeveloped, as if Bergman had planned to follow through with something else but never got around to it.Despite the thematic problems, ""The Passion of Anna"" has much to recommend it. Ullmann and von Sydow are, as always, outstanding, and it is interesting to see how they handle their cryptic roles. All Bergman fans will want to see this intermittently-inspired film; others should approach with some caution."
3,Yet anoyher flaw with the bergman collection???,The movie itself is fascinating but the transfer is so-so. I don't know if it's a problem with my copy but the image is notcentered (I had to rotate the image).
4,Genius at work...,I am amongst those Bergman fans who prefer his post-Persona work best. I find many of his late 40's-50's films too calculated & highly pretentious (especially films like The Silence & Winter Light). One of the best Bergman films of the 70's
5,Excellent Harmonica Book,"Great Harmonica Book.These songs are covered:Day by Day, Black and White, Candy man, THE FIRST TIME EVER I SAW YOUR FACE, Take me home, country roads, what have they done to my song ma?, SCARBOROUGH FAIR, georgy girl, everything is beautiful, ME AND MY BOBBY MCGEE, cherish, rose garden, SPINNING WHEEL, HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN...and more..."
5,Good as any electric shaver for a fraction of the cost,"I originally bought this shaver from a local drug store before heading out of town. I was leaving for an extended trip to a location where I wouldn't have easy access to electricity. During that trip, I grew to love this little shaver. After returning home, I continued using it for about 7 more years before needing to replace it. I replaced the blades & foil a couple times. Though it wasn't always easy to find replacements in local stores, I'm sure the internet will solve this problem for me in the future. I like this shaver so much, and it's so inexpensive, that I bought two this time around."
1,Cheap is expensive,Simply put this shaver starts off with a bang and two months later peters out with a fizzle. I know foil screens don't last forever on a shaver but 60 days after I bought this shaver it was already nicking & cutting my face up. Do you replace a foil screen on an inexpensive shaver like this ? ....No....you toss it in the garbage and learn that cheap is expensive.
4,Great little shaver,"This is a great little shaver, especially for the price. Not perfect, but then I'm not sure what a perfect shaver would look like (I prefer blades for the most part). I'm not a heavily-bearded person but I've used it at home and traveling and it works quite well for me. As with other shavers I've had, it seems you have to keep going over certain spots several times to get a ""smooth"" feeling (I even have to do this with certain places with my razors). The one set of batteries has lasted several weeks (and they're even the rechargeables). Lots of nice features--beard/sideburns trimmer, immersible in water, etc. All in all I would highly recommend it, again particularly at this price."
3,disappointed,Convenient and inexpensive but disappointed that three out of four I gave away as presents worked. The head of the shaver kept falling off so it was useless. But the other three worked fine.
2,Not great,"Its a decent deat for $10 especially since its washable. But if you miss a couple of days of shaving (like the weekend), don't expect it to do a very good job getting ""long"" hairs. Since it flips into a case I expected it to contain all the loose hairs inside. Instead, it leaked them out all over things in my travel case. Also, if you use it a couple of times and don't clean expect to be cleaning your clothes too since during operation everthing inside tends to vibrate out. The trimmer is horrible. Its very small and curved so it was very difficult to trim my moustache quickly. One great feature is that it won't turn on unless its flipped open for use; so no worries at the airport. That and it holds its own cleaning brush. Spend some money and get a real razor."
1,Not what i expected,"I expected a shaver that would actually ""shave"" but it doesn't. I tried it out and it barely scraped the surface of my stubble. Maybe I misunderstood its purpose and it was meant only for removing the odd tiny bit of hair here and there. Even so, calling it a shaver is very misleading as it simply doesn't shave. Fortunately it was not too expensive, but I think you are better off paying a few more bucks and getting a proper shaver"
2,You get what u Paid for,"Bought this to keep my face clean shaved between hair cuts..... Works of if your facial hair is very low but dont expect it to cut longer hairs......It wasnt worth the money in my opinion, but then again you get what you pay for."
3,good value for the $$$$$$,"This razor is an excellent value. It is sure not a replacement for the blade (if your a blade man) but it serves well on the road for a little touch up. As all electric razors have done me, this one gives me quite a bit of irratation and razor burn. Be sure to use with some electric gel (it is a waterproof razor). It makes cleaning the razor a little more difficult, but saves your hide..........gym"
5,"I rarely write reviews, but had to for this..",Purchased this little razor from Amazon in Feb 2008. I have just taken my first trip using it. I cannot believe it. I have a $120 Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver at home. This little guy gives me just as close a shave as the Panasonic - and with less time going back and forth. It even gets the neck hairs very well. Now my wife is asking me why I spent $120 on the Panasonic - and I don't have a good answer...
2,Average Shaver at Best,"I brought this after using a Norelco Rotary for years, and found this disappointing. I need to use a razor to touch up what this shaver misses, and I have to work at shaving with this razor. It is small and compact and uses standard batteries with little power drain. It is probably best used for a travel razor, but you won't like it as your daily shaver. It will not cut light hairs, and works best on heavy thick beards."
1,Great design and features but DOES NOT WORK,"I really don't understand how the designers, who obviously put so much though into this thing, let it come to market while this ineffective. Honestly, you could not shave a balloon with this thing. It feels solid and well built, it has great features (battery power, size, water-proof, built in trimmer, built in foil guard/lock, built in cleaning brush) but you could get a better shave if you clicked you heels together and wished for your facial hair to fall out. I don't even have thick facial hair and this thing is useless. I do not understand how it got so many great reviews...it's not worth it."
3,Good shaver but large & heavy for travel,"I bought this shaver for travel. It's a great shaver. I have used it every day since it arrived several weeks ago. But, it is not exactly a travel shaver. Yes it operates on batteries. But it is almost the same size and weight as my regular shaver. Braun 370 dimensions: 4.75"" high x 2.25"" wide x 1.125"" thick at center. I expected something much smaller and lighter."
3,Not for People with Arthritis,"This razor has good battery life and shaves as well as any electric razor I've ever used. However, if you have arthritis or other hand/grip problems, you may find this razor difficult to use. The on/off slide button is flat and difficult to move. The trimmer is very small and slides out perpendicular to the side of the razor. It's difficult to slide in and out and awkward to use. There is a small cleaning brush in the base--a nice touch; but, again, difficult to get a grip on to slide it out. Finally, although it's washable, the instructions tell you to coat the shaving screen with a light machine oil or cooking oil after each washing. Unless you normally travel with a bottle of Wesson Oil, that's an inconvenience."
5,Braun 370,"This is a very nice foil shaver, which happens to run on AAA batteries. The pop-up (actually slide out) trimmer is a little awkward to use until you get used to it, since it sticks out from the side. My husband uses it in our RV where we may not have 120 volts for a corded shaver or charger, and its compact size and light weight are also advantages."
2,Decent but not a Monday morning shaver.,"Its a decent deat for $10 especially since its washable. But if you miss a couple of days of shaving (like the weekend), don't expect it to do a very good job getting ""long"" hairs. Since it flips into a case I expected it to contain all the loose hairs inside. Instead, it leaked them out all over things in my travel case. Also, if you use it a couple of times and don't clean expect to be cleaning your clothes too since during operation everthing inside tends to vibrate out. The trimmer is horrible. Its very small and curved so it was very difficult to trim my moustache quickly. One great feature is that it won't turn on unless its flipped open for use; so no worries at the airport. That and it holds its own cleaning brush. Spend some money and get a real razor."
3,"Nice, But Room for Improvement","I enjoy having a smaller electric for travel. And the swivel design that protects the screen is a nice innovation. I always take this on trips, leaving my bulkier Norelco at home.I also own an earlier model of this shaver-about 3 years old--and it gives a closer shave. But the shave provided by this model is close enough.My main gripe is the lack of a built-in rechargeable battery. Disposable AA cells are expensive, and rechargeable AA's are less convenient than simply being able to plug in the shaver or place it in a dock.If this shaver had a rechargeable built-in battery, it would definitely earn a 5-star rating. Until then, I'll consider it ""average."""
5,Have used this for 4 years now,"At my University, I am required to be clean-shaven. For someone of my propensity, having this little fella in my bookbag has saved my butt from a bunch of demerits. It isn't as clean as a normal shave, but does the trick if you only have one day's growth, maybe two. for me the evening of the second day it really gets kinda ragged when I used this. I have recommended this to many a freshman :)"
4,excellent travel shaver bargain,"This is an excellent travel shaver (rotating cover) but not as good as the Panasonic ES4815s which I reviewedPanasonic ES4815S Pro Curve Compact Mens Shaver With Double Blades, Blue/Silver."
3,I Am NOT Impressed at all,I bought this low-priced shaver after reading the rave reviews. But it hasn't worked for me so far. It takes too long to shave; it is loud; it doesn't give me a close shave. The search continues...
5,Great little shaver,"I would not use this as a primary shaver. It's narrow little head isn't as efficient as my big Braun. However, for travel and back-up, it is wonderful. Has plenty of power and is small enough to stow away with ease. I also like the fact that even with months between trips, I can simply slip in a set of back-up batteries and be ready. A rechargeble just isn't well suited to this role."
1,worked 4 times then head broke - no replacement parts,Worked 4 times then head broke due to flimsy construction. Braun site had no replacement head. Typical modern day made-to-break junk then they want you to purchase another. This cost me $6 per shave. Braun buyer beware.
1,Doesn't Shave at all!,"This shaver is very poor quality. I'm 18 and have very light facial hair (I only have to shave about once a week). This shaver didn't shave anything at all! I tried it with shaving gel, without, water, and dry. I ended up only with a bunch of cuts and no shorter facial hair.I ended up cleaning everything up with my Schick Quattro. Stay away from this product; you get what you pay for."
2,OK Not Great,Was so looking forward to this ........ gave as gift to brother and he said at first was great but approx. 2 wks. later it had plenty of power but no shave (sharpness of blades I guess). He rubbed over his face as usual and it left more hair than it cut. I had read previous reviews and thought it would perform longer than it did ......... disappointed !!
1,Horrible shaver!,"Among the hundreds of enthusiastic reviewiers, I noticed one that gave one star and said the shaver doesn't do its job and only hurt his face. Just our luck that the same thing would happen to us.My husband tried to shave with this darn thing and said he had to go over the same spot multiple times and still it would just hurt his face and cut nothing! He ended up shaving his sore face with his old shaver.Now my problem is how to get rid of a used shaver. Can I return it? Who would buy a used shaver and that doesn't even work well? My husband told me that we should never give this product as a present. Anyway, the lesson is that one should not believe something is great just because it has hundreds of 5 stars."
2,Just OK,"I have this unit probably for last 2 years, I also had first generation of this unit which was 5615. This is a OK unit compared to 5615 which was superior in every way. Like any big corporation, Braun got a hit with the 5615 and then they totally screwed up the dynamics of 5615 and came with PocketGo 370. I am looking for replacement foil and cutter block for my old 5615..."
1,"Oh, god, It hurs!!!","Yes, it's cheap, but it's cheap with a reason. God, it can hurt your skin so badly, I really don't understand why it could get so many 5's. Trust me, don't even think, stay away this shaver. I just threw it away."
2,Good Quality - but only for lighter beards,I have had this razor for a year now. It still is in good condition and mechanically works well. It is very well designed to protect the foil and be kept clean. Unfortunately for me I have very heavy facial hair. This razor just can not give me a clean shave under any circumstance. I had a Titanium Turbo for a year before this razor and was very satisfied with its ability to cut my tougher than average beard. I am very disapointed with this razors ability to provide me with a clean shave. The best it can do is leave me looking patchy if I use it twice a day. I would have gave it one or no stars but it is too well designed and built to deserve that sort of flame. I would only recomend this to someone who has a light beard.
3,Good value,"First time electric shaver user. It does not cut as close as a manual bladed razor would. The foil gets pretty warm/hot after about 30 seconds, I have to blow on it to keep it from irritating my face. It feels well made. I wouldn't use it as an everyday shaving device, but it is good for 'touch ups' here and there between shaves with a manual razor. Also great for travel.Since they can be purchased for $20 or less, I would recommend them. If I was looking for an electric shaver to replace manual shaving, I might try a full size rotary shaver."
1,Won't cut longer whiskers,"This thing has little bitty holes in the screen instead of slots. The whiskers have to go through the holes to get cut. Try threading a hair through a needle. It might cut short stubble OK, but it just won't cut a three day growth of my graying blond beard at all. No how, no way. Run the thing across your face until it's raw, ain't gonna happen. I suppose I could shave three or four times a day and it might work, but I am retired and don't have any reason or motivation to do that. For 20 years I wore a full face beard and didn't shave, just mowed every few months. If I could find a decent shaver I might shave twice a week maybe, just to get around the ""toothpaste in the beard"" problem. This thing won't do the job for me. Too bad, it's a nice widget otherwise. Sure wish it worked for me."
5,Best portable shaver yet,"With the price of razors going through the roof, I was amazed to find a quality electric shaver for under $ 20.00. I have used this little gem for at least 35 shaves . . and it not only gives me a good shave, I'm still on the first set of double A batteries !"
5,Great Shaver,This shaver arrived to me just 5 days ago. It's very good. I recommend it to anyone. I think better will be to use it every day. Thanks to Braun!
4,Braun 370bk Cordless Shaver w/Rechargeable,"I like the shaver very much, however, there isn't anything rechargeable about this shaver. You can only use batteries in it; there is no cord or anything that indicates that it can be recharged. If I was to receive a rechargeable--I didn't.This shaver is very good for what it is intended. The only compliant that I have is that it is not RECHARGEABLE!James A. Brownlee"
5,Good shaver/great price,"I've used a variety of electric shavers over the years. I was looking online for a good price for Norelco or Panasonic replacement blades and cutters, some of which cost half as much or more than most razors. I saw the Braun 370 and liked the reviews I read. I initially bought it to use when I travel. I've used it every day for a month. The shave is as good or better than my more expensive shavers. The first set of batteries lasted nearly three weeks. To try to keep the planet ""green,"" I will look at trying rechargeable batteries."
5,Bargain,"Fantastic little shaver, great for roadtrips or storing at the office for when you forget. May not be the best for those with heavy beard, but good enough, and simply amazing for the price."
4,It works great,"I bought one for my boyfriend because he grows hair faster than any other human being I know. He didn't think that he was going to like it because it is a AA battery foil shaver, but he did and he loves it! He doesn't use it all the time even though I wish he would but before he needs to go to work he runs it over his face and it's done. And it didn't cost me an arm and a leg to buy it for him. Bonus, it's washable and I thought that that was only what really expencive shavers would do. Think again!"
5,A well designed product,"My shaving routine has me using a foil shaver and then following that up with a Gillette Mach3. The P-70 is one of the best foil shavers I've ever used and overall one of the best designed products I've ever seen. It's completely self contained, waterproof, has a built in trimmer that retracts and even has a small attached brush for cleaning the foil blades. Plus the cover is built-in. I read the previous reviews, bought one and agree 100% with all of the great things said about this shaver. I'm thinking about buying an extra for a spare. If you find something you really like, I find it's best to buy a spare. No telling how long they'll be around.Highly recommended!"
5,Men's Shaver,"This item was a gift and the recipient is quite pleased with the ""PocketGo"" Men's Shaver."
4,Great little shaver,"I got this for when my other razor needs recharging and I forget, or when I need to run around the house to get or take care of something. I like that it's portable and can go anyplace. It looks good and feels good in my hand. It shaves fine for me but then my beard isn't too heavy, which may be a problem for some other people. I like it!"
2,don't understand all the fuss,"I purchased this razor based on the great reviews I read here. After using it for a couple months I finally just gave up. It was my first purchase of a foil razor, vice a rotary, and I had high hopes. After multiple, multiple, swipes in multiple directions there was always hair remaining whether I used it dry or in the shower. I would get cuts along my neck even after having used it for months. If I skipped a day or two shaving over the weekend, this razor was near useless for the job come Monday morning. Portability and size and the price are all big plusses, but in the end I was buying a razor and this did not do the job well."
3,good for a travel shaver,"I have never used an electric razor before and this is my first time.One thing is you cant be using this shaver to save time because you would be done with a better shave sooner if you used a razor.the down motion does not seem to cut any beard, it made no effect on my 1 day old stubble and it got cleared( not completely) once I started more of upward moion.I finished shaving about an hour ago and my face is still itchy and red and I still got some stubble left and a few small nicks despite using the pre-shave gel.may be i have a sensitive skin..Its definately good as a travel shaver, but i may not like the irritation if i have to use it daily.May be it takes time to get used to it?for the price( around $10) this is a good product."
4,14 Bucks For A Terrific RAZOR,"I cannot beleive I only spent 14 dollars on such a great little razor. I bought this to do quick shaves and it does just that. Do I get as close of a shave as I do in the shower? No, but it does a really good job in between shaves. Don't hesitate to get this razor. It works on two AA batteries and it is also waterproof. Great little gadget!!!"
5,Good buy,"I bought this razor specifically to get me through a 2 month trip, and it worked flawlessly, even better then the Remington I use at home. I went through one set of batteries (2 AA, the unit is not rechargeable) after the first month or so."
2,"Well, it is better than nothing.","The price tells it all. It simply doesn't give a good shave. About the same as my dull Norelco shaving heads. Don't expect to get the same quality shave as you will get with a more expensive model. Even my Remington, which was given to me on my graduateion from high school in 1955 (yes, 1955) gave a comparable shave."
4,Just fine for travel,"Like other reviewers, I'm aware that most shavers leave a little stubble behind that needs to be mowed with a blade. I bought this shaver, however, for traveling in the new age where we can't carry our usual complement of supplies when flying. It does a pretty good job, even dry, and that's a plus when in a hurry as I often am. I can now leave the shave cream at home -- one less liquid hassle. The batteries are a plus too as I don't need to bother with yet another charger. So far, I like it."
4,Handy car shaver,"I keep it in my car for those days I forget to shave. Easy to use and works very well. I normally use a Norelco and the Braun shaves as close as that but not as comfortably. Very noisy! Love the cover. Protects the razor head, you can't lose it, prevents it from accidentally turning on, and it doesn't need a case."
3,just ok considering everything,This item is most convenient especially the ability to wash the cutting blade daily in the sink but I find it to be less than satsifactory in terms of closeness of shave. But then almost all Braun's have this same deficiency in my opinion. The other Braun pocket shaver which is black but also functions on batteries is better in that regard which I also purchased but it cannot be cleaned by water.
2,Electric Shavers not for everyone.,"I bought this shaver since it got good reviews, however if you have been a Gillete user all your life like me, this may not work out for you. It did a good job shaving my cheeks and chin, however under the chin and neck area it had a real hard time. Then you end up using the shaver over and over in these areas until it gets red with irritation. It could be that the shaving screen that this uses is not good for those areas. Norelco or some other brand may work better. Although the price is very cheap I have to return this unit."
2,"Okay, light-duty shaver for a low price","I needed a travel shaver to take on a trip to India because I was warned not to use a blade razor to avoid getting contaminated water in a facial cut. While the price and size of this shaver is okay, it just didn't shave that well unless I went over the same area several times. But doing so irritated my skin too much. End result is that I used the shaver for quick touch-ups and I ended up looking like I needed a shave for much of the trip. Might work well for light beards, avoid it if you have a heavy, fast-growing beard."
3,Braun PocketGo P-70,"This is not a bad shaver for the price. Very compact and easy to maintain.It does not do a very good job on the neck, otherwise it gives a closeshave."
2,"Works well, but doesn't last","I just used this as a travel shaver, and it worked really well, for the month and a half I had it. Yeah, it broke after a month and a half; cheap plastic."
1,Misses a lot,"I bought this for travel about a year ago. This is a very frustrating product to use. You have to go over the same places again and again and again, and it still misses hairs. I finally gave up a bought a different razor."
2,Average or below performance,"I was excited about this little shaver at first. I have loved my 10 year old Braun foil shaver, but it's no longer available. I love the size and the design of this P-70, (except for the poor side burn trimmer design). It seemed great as a shaver to keep in my bag to complement my new Braun home shaver. Then I realized that it was leaving LOTS of uncut facial hair. I don't have a thick beard, in fact, quite the opposite. Yet this little shaver requires 2 to 3 times the normal shaving effort and time. The design and the idea is great, but the cut is below average. I personally would not likely buy it again."
2,patchy fail,"With all the positive reviews, it may just be the type of facial hair I have is incompatible with this razor. It misses patches and requires many passes to get much of anything at all. I have tried wet/dry +/- shaving cream. All combos lead to similar results."
4,Good travel shaver,"I normally use a blade and, when on trips over 1 week, do take a blade and shaving gel. However, I got this for 2-4 day getaways. It gives an (IMHO) acceptable shave. Not usually using an electric or being used to one, it seems my face takes a little more heat when I am done using the Braun instead of a blade, but nothing bad. It is easy to throw this into the travel bag as the flip top protects the blades. Clean up is easy with the snap in brush and running the head under water. At first, it was a little hard to open the battery compartment (as I take them out when the shaver is in storage) but that got easier after a few openings. Not sure about frequent use, but for a few days, it has my vote!"
5,Outstanding - this is my second one.,This razor works extremely well. My beard grows out at an angle and this little Braun is the only one that picks up ALL the hairs. It is my second one - I wore out the first one (purchased in 1989).
3,Not quite as small as previous version,I kept a smaller Braun in the car for years (it fell apart).Cover rotates around nicely.
1,Product returned,The shaver did not function or turn on when I received it. I returned it to Amazon for a refund and bought a Panasonic from Amazon as a replacement
3,Cool Device,"Its a OK device for below $20.The most positive feature, its Handy. But it needs two batteries."
5,husband loves it,my husband has burn up so many plugging them in and letting them charge too long and I wanted to find him something he could take in his car but not have to worry with the dead battery and worry with chargingHE loves this and you can get batteries anywhere...
4,"Great product, but impossible to get cheap replacement parts","I dropped the cutter block in the sink and couldnt fish it out, so i tried buying it online. That alone costs $10 plus shipping. It cost more to ship that cutterblock than to buy another Pocketgo. A replacement foil costs $10 plus shipping also, which is ridiculous."
5,Perfect travel shaver,"I had the predecessor to this model for almost ten years; with a pair of lithium AA batteries it would last seemingly forever. Both it and this model are very lightweight and small, which is what makes it so perfect to keep in a travel kit. This new model has the added advantage of the head being washable under a sink. My old model got chewed up by a dog... otherwise it would have kept going :)"
4,DR-Z 400SM,"I'm using this on my DR-Z per Braking's recommendation. They suggested me not use their POW02 bracket that was listed for my bike because I was not using OEM pads. I tried it before contacting them, and it is nowhere near right. That bracket gives enough room for a 330mm rotor. This bracket, the pow13, gives a much better caliper location with a 320mm rotor, but it's still not ideal. Using Braking brand pads, the pad sits right at the edge of the rotor. Using EBC pads I get a slight overhang. Since I'm not aware of another brand making a relocation bracket for the DRZ400SM to use with the 320 rotor, this will have to do."
2,Poor Kindle Edition,"The Kindle edition contains a large number of errors, in the hundreds, likely reflecting poor or non-existent proofing of scanned text. Most are obvious and distracting (""1"" for ""I"", for instance); occasionally, they render sentences incoherent, and it is not clear what the originals were. Rarely, but non-negligilby, they change meaning--we have ""Wonderland"" for ""Wunderkind"" in the story--yes--""Wunderkind""."
4,A master of characterization and setting,"What strikes me most about McCullers is the simple yet rich complexity of her characters. While some of the earlier stories in this book felt too incomplete for me, as if they were more vignettes than stories, the tales grew stronger as I read on. The Haunted Boy is my favorite because it resonates with a sad truthfulness as a boy struggles to cope with a tragic event from the past which he's yet to deal with emotionally.I think any true fan of literary storytelling will admit that, though perhaps not always perfect, Carson McCullers' writing as a whole is a sample of this genre at its best."
5,Beautiful and Essential,"This collection of McCullers short stories, or basically lesser known works, is truly essential for any fan of her writing. Many of the short stories equal and rival the poetic power of her best longer works including the two novellas captured here. Also the reader gets to take a journey through her writing as several different periods of her life are represented from earlier to later works, written shortly before her untimely death. For my two cents, the short story, ""Instant of the Hour After"" is worth the price of admission by itself, as it is a brillant little story that immediately recalls McCullers own marriage while beautifully illustrating the daily trials and costs of living with alcoholism, as the centerpiece of a relationship. You will cherish having this book in your collection."
2,Too many problems with Kindle edition.,"I returned this edition to Amazon after reading The Ballad of the Sad Cafe only, because of the lack of a hypertext link from the table of contents to the beginning of each selection, and because of the frustrating number of typos in the text. To find the Ballad I had to scroll through the entire book looking for the beginning of the story, which the TOC showed was on page 195, but the Kindle edition doesn't include page numbers, only ""location numbers"", which bear no relation to the page nos. It was like reading a Project Gutenberg edition of a free classic, but I expected better for my $8.25, thank you."
2,Collected stories of Carson McCullers,"I have been a huge fan of Carson McCullers since I first read one of her books. She writes in a very personal voice, and weaves great stories that I find very nostalgic. I am particularly drawn to The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, which I have read numerous times. However I was truly dissaspointed in this collection as it appeared to have been written by a blind dyslexic. So many errors that at times I found it painful to continue. This was one of the worst Kindle downloads I ever ordered."
3,OK for a rewrite,Ok the american version is ment for kids and was totaly redone for kids in america. If your an older person who is a fan. You might want to eather pirate the japanese version or go to japan and buy them.
5,Year of the SEGA/SI,"Well, this is a purely based football/soccer game. It has a long line of heritage dating back to 1993, when the original, and soem say the best arrived on our amigas/pc 386 sx25's.If you like soccer/football then ull love this game. Its a lot like other god games in fact, u have the ability to choose your team, buy/sell players, contract deals, pick tactics etc etc. It has improved massively this version, you have far more control over training, tactics and players moods which all allow you to improve, or unimprove your team!In all this games is huge and the more u play (i suggest u download the elp manual from the site for tips) the more u will be involved and discover all the tweaks that make it so addictive!"
2,Very dissapointing,"If you are looking to buy an introductory business book for someone withgout any business knowledge, such as a high school student, this book is not a bad choice. However, for anyone with more than one month's experience out in the business world, this book will dissapoint.The author lacks experience as an entrepreneur and business person and it really shows in his writing."
3,Decent book,The author seems to have a pretty good handle on the topic but doesn't really say all that much that hasn't been said before in a thousand other books.
3,I was dissapointed after buying it on the hype,"The hype surrounding the book promises a guide book on how to start up a fast growth company. That is why I purchased it. But upon reading it I have discovered that it's more of a Business 101 college text book overview of entrepreneurship. The author has chosen to go for breadth in place of depth. Most, if not all, topics are covered in one or two brief paragraphs. So if you really wish to drill down into marketing, or finance, or selling, etc, you need to look elsewhere.Still it's a decent read written by a young man who has passion for the subject of entrepreneurship if not real experience."
2,Not nearly as helpful as the title suggests,"Going by the title I assumed this was a hands on entrepreneurship manual for launching a company but in reality its more of an overview of business history, marketing, finance, operations, HR, etc. Think textbook for Business 101. Too bad the author didn't stick to the theme promised by the title."
5,Great start for entrepreneurs,"The title of this book, ""Roadmap,"" does a nice job in capturing what the reader interested in entrepreneurial ventures can expect to get by reading it. Like a city map, Roadmap describes the significant landmarks that are encountered in the entrepreneurial process and how to deal with them from a practical standpoint. I found the chapters on putting the right team together and the venture capital process to be most informative. For those interested in more detail or additional reading on one or more of the various topics covered, the book provdes ample references. I highly recommend Roadmap to anyone serious about starting a business, especially someone going out for the first time."
1,Sickeningly awful,"To think that ""Honey"" was No.1 in the United States for five weeks gives you a good idea of how depraved our society is. It's this kind of sappy emotionalism that gave birth to the kind of over-vibratoing American Idolish disposable pop-trash that pollutes our radios today.It rhymes ""what the heck"" with ""hugged my neck"". That's just silly."
5,"Bobby Goldsboro: new to me, and brilliant!","This greatest hits CD just touches on what Bobby can sing. Honey is a beautiful song with such emotion. Autumn Of My Life was introduced to me by a friend - thank you friend*.I am new to Bobby's music, but through Amazon, and the content on this CD, I am certain to add more of Bobby's music to my collection.The song about the Clown is quite lovely as well - right up to its end when we meet the Clown!Buy it, and build your collection of hits from this memorable era."
5,NOT THE CRAP THEY SELL AT TARGET,I DID NOT EXPECT THE WEIGHT OF THE PACKAGE. I DID NOT EXPECT HOW HEAVY THESE WOULD BE. THE DESIGN IS EVEN NICER IN PERSON AND VERY STURDY STRUCTURE. THEY ARE THICK AND HEAVY.THE SERVING SET WAS ALSO A SURPRISE. ITS PERFECT
5,Very Nice Book for ID'ing Trees,"great photos, descriptions in helping us ID trees in our area. book has a good feel and a good size."
5,great tree book,"Great pictures and good info on trees, a must have for those wanting to learn how to identify trees! I used it for a class in addition to the required text and I got an A."
3,A good secondary reference,"This book relies heavily on color photos of bark, leaves, flowers, and fruiting bodies. This method makes winter identification diificult, and even when in leaf subtleties which differentiate species may not be evident. I use the Peterson guide to trees and shrubs (ISBN 039535370X) as my primary resource, and use the Audubon book as a secondary source."
4,National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Trees,"This is a excellant ID manual for the trees in the eastern USA and Canada. I feel that the way the manual is layed out is a big plus. The photos are very good. This is a book for all levels of the studing of these beautiful kings of the earth.The only area that can be improved (in my opinion) is the IDing of trees in the winter stage or off season.Overall, this book/manual is very portable and is easy to transport, fitting well in a backpack."
2,"Pretty, but mostly useless","If you are serious about identifying trees, this book won't help much. A lot of the most common trees are omitted, particularly in the oak family. The thrust of this book seems more toward the odder varieties. I wish I had my money back."
4,"Not bad, but flawed","All photos, no drawing a plus - photos of bark, leaves (both summer and fall colors), fruit. It has a rare tree the ""Franklinias"" not seen in the wild since 1803 and it doesn't have the Japanese maple, one of the most common trees here in the Northeast. Otherwise a good guide."
5,National Audubon society field guide to n. american trees eastern region,All the audubon books are extremely helpful & easy to use. I keep buying them as gifts because I have most of the collection myself. You can't go wrong!
4,"beautiful book, but very small","this was a beautiful book, but very small in size, be sure to check the size of the book to make sure thats the size you want."
5,National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Trees: Eastern Region (Eastern),Product received in great condition and very useful.
2,"Good reference, poor guide","After reading the many glowing reviews of this book, I must conclude that I am either dumber than a rock or else as mean spirited as the Grinch, or perhaps both. I am a big fan of the Audubon Society, but perhaps the society should stick with birds. This guide to trees is not a guide at all. It is a reference. Almost any other guide you may purchase is going to be superior to this one if your goal is the identification of trees. Of course, this book contains plenty of information and offers much to learn, and there are some, though not enough, nice color photos; so it is a worthwhile book. But it is not an effective guide to tree identification. On the other hand, I have found this book to be very effective as a frustration inducer, stress elevator, and aggravation intensifier."
5,Pleased but with some reservations,"The book is an important addition to your personal Tree Identification library; however, it won't be the only book you'll want to own for the purpose. There are many clues for identifying trees. This book does a good job with color photos of leaves and flowers grouped by look-alikes. Although, sometimes the photographer didn't seem to understand what was important to include in the shot. I just wish I didn't have to flip back and forth across the book to see everything about a particular tree species. Those very thin pages in back are tough to turn."
1,Useless - we all have internet,"My cut : you must be really fooled by the pics to buy this book. There are lots of detailed guides online. Not with color pics, butvery helpful. And probably you want some surprise when you play, don't you ?"
1,this took the cake,i have read my share of strategy guides this one sucked B!@#@. Sure it told you about the bosses ahead but the strategies for the bosses sucked and i missed half of the mini items that i needed so. never buying for anyone.
3,Left out stuff,"While this stratagy guide, does tell you the basic out line of the levels and where most of the items are, they leave many out. I want my 20$ worth man! and this guide ain't doin it for me. (What do you do when you see a headless french man running through the forest? Ya stop laughing and reload your shotgun!)"
2,Pass on,"I don't know. All of them sound about the same. And the sad slow movements simply make no sense. I mean, WHY? What's the point? Really. Look elsewhere for good vivaldi I say. The fast movements all sound similar, and the violin and cello are mostly blurred by the winds anyway, so if you like strings mostly, you can forget this. You will mostly hear the recorder and the bassoon, only occasionally will you hear the old period violin, and more rarely you will hear the cello. Even though scored for several instruments, Vivaldi only uses some of them on the slow movements. In the fast movements you can't really know whether an oboe is even playing."
1,States obvious / Waste of money,"The book I have by title ""Study Smart"" with this ISBN was published 1992 but has a yellow cover and lists author Theodore Silver. The book is not worth the costs (financial, time/effort). The tips that are practical to use are obvious and can be summarized in a few words (don't worry that you don't understand everything you're expected to ""learn"" and attempt to learn from multiple sources). The remainder of the book is waste and not feasible for implementation for anyone that cannot devote an impractical amount of time toward study efforts. The book also contains a number of confusing typographical errors in a number of mathematical examples (for example, variable ""X"" is later stated as variable ""Y"").I recommend DO NOT BUY this book."
3,Good for those with corporations,This is a good in-depth book but not necessarily for those with small businesses or an advertising budget of less than huge. It is from a corporate standpoint so did not apply to me but has some interesting information.
3,Good but not the best,"I ordered the video based on one viewer's comments that the Video would be simpler to follow than the book ( don't know if he read the book) but what I found was the video was hard to follow. She talked very fast and it's only 55 minutes long leaving the author with little time to go into details about each shape. However, overall I found the tape interesting and very informative I just think that it would have helped if the video were longer and there was some type of assessment that viewer could have taken to determine what shape he/she is."
3,Meh...I don't know...,"Ordered this video for work, but actually saw Susan Dellinger in person on a business outing. Three stars for being entertaining, but I'm not sure how much actual value to get in your every day business dealings. The author pigeon-holes your co-workers into these limited personality types and attempts to tell you how to work with them. Personally, I think a better method of improving your workforce is to take the best qualities of each personality and help your employees achieve those aspects.But it is a highly entertaining video."
2,There are global warming films that are much better than this one.,"I found this film slow-moving and its slowness caused the target to get lost. While the concept of looking back was a good one, I feel that its execution in this film left something to be desired. After a half hour I started skipping hoping for something better but did not find it. MUCH BETTER FILMS ON THE SUBJECT ARE AVAILABLE."
4,My Concern,This is an excellent compilation of Kabbalistic terminology and concepts. My only concern is that the author legitimizes certain questionable sources that may have been better not mentioned in an otherwise well done book.
3,Not too bad but could be better,"The outside stitching is acceptable, but in the inside there is some irregularity on the stitches.The swivel belt clip is detachable but should be also removable, that is, the part that attaches to the belt clip should also be removable (screw) so that it fits better in the pocket when you don't want to use a belt clip. Still, it fits fairly well in my back pocket.The treo 650 fits nicely, but sometimes it is hard to adjust the snap closure to close firmelly.Overall, acceptable quality for this price."
4,You really shouldn't judge a book (or Album) by it's cover.,"I picked up this album for a $1.99 at a local store. Initially I was skeptical about the quality of the music I could expect when I saw the very boring and stock cover (very Kenny G like). Though after listening to the first few tracks all of my initial worries where forgotten, this album is anything but stock and boring. All the musicians do a great job and sound wonderful together, though in my opinion Nancy Walker (Piano), Mark Kelso (Drums), and Roberto Occhipinti (Bass) are the real stand outs. For what I'm assuming is being treated like a background mood music CD this is a great album. Truly a great buy."
2,The Mortician's Art,"Well it looks like Toscanini on the cover. It sounds like Toscanini. The fleet tempos also point to the Maestro. But even with the passage of time (this disc has been in my collection for over two years) I cannot say for sure.Yes, Toscanini normally recorded in dry, deadening studios but this is an intensification beyond measure. The remastering has gutted these radio-recordings of whatever ambience they initially had. Worryingly, there is no hiss. I can live with our high frequency friend if it comes in train with orchestral warmth and depth of tone; its absence here is disconcerting in the extreme.The Ninth from this series is equally aridBeethoven: Symphony Number 9compared with the performance from ArgentinaBeethoven: Symphonny No. 9 in D Minor, Opus 123; the latter is awash with hiss but the calibre of the music-making soon nullifies its presence.I do not want to judge Toscanini in Beethoven on the basis of this disc. I suggest you don't either."
1,UTAH SUCKS,"Enjoy it while you can Utah, This will be the best you can do. Also no one expected Alabama to do near as well as they did, so you do not have a lot to brag about. If Utah was in the S.E.C their record would be 6-6 at best...So enjoy the moment !"
3,Hieroglyphics stamps review,"The hieroglyphic stamps are well-constructed and useful, and the accomanying booklet contains a minimal description of the context and use of Egyptian hieroglyphs. I used the stamps for a hieroglyphics activity at a Vacation Bible School program based on ancient Egypt, and they worked very well for that."
4,Good to Use With Children,"I had gotten this item in hopes of spending time with my little sibling, teaching her a thing or two about Egyptian writing. I had expected to drag her into this, but, surprisingly, she came in with full excitement because she had already learned about hieroglyphs in school (I'm way past remembering what 2nd grade taught me).We had a wonderful time creating words and names with the stamps, and learning more about the lettering and symbolism from the book. Although I'm not too familiar with Egyptian writing, I can only rely on what the stamps provide, and so am hesitant to base my full trust in Roehrig's research.But, all in all, if this kit is directed to families, then it is highly recommended."
4,Understanding heiroglyphs,"This book will appeal to anyone with an interest in Hieroglyphics and how they were used. If that person is you, this is the book to get you started. Five thousand years ago, hieroglyphics were developed as a writing system and used only by scribes. Their meanings were lost in the passage of time until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone in 1799 A.D. which revealed a translation of the mysterious Egyptian symbols into Greek. The hieroglyphic characters were discovered to represent sounds rather than words. This book includes stamps and an ink pad to use to make your own words and sentances in hieroglyphics as you learn their meanings and start to become proficient in this method of writing. It is highly entertaining as well as very educational. It is beautifully illustrated as well."
3,"B+ for content, C- for packaging","I always like to run active items past a child or two before interjecting my own opinion, so my homeschoolers had a bit of fun today withFun with Hieroglyphs. Most everyone (including me) had trouble closing the flap after putting the tray of stamps back into the box cover. Several commented that the rubber stamps were hard to fit back into the tray and no one could figure out where to put the book that accompanies the kit come reassembly time. (I had taken the book out and the slot that it fits into is not readily apparent.) Don't expect long term use from the packaging this kit comes in, especially if you're using it in a classroom situation.The book that comes with the kit is very well done and provides a wealth of information for upper elementary students interested in Ancient Egypt."
1,missing 2 stamps,would not recommend this seller. Sent several emails telling them that there were missing parts to the set. With no reply from them some three days later. If you buy this set be sure to make sure all 24 stamps are there.
4,a good read,"this is a well told tale about some interesting people in fairly ordinary life. it is a great read and not as sentimental as his other works. i liked the setting, the characters, and the pace of the book. the story wanders a bit at the end, but still ends well. i think he is one of the best writers today for vivid prose about the place or the scene, and often chooses just the right word or phrase to bring us there. i didn't care for 'bridges', but gave this a chance, and it was well worth the time and money. and lastly, it isn't a chick book at all. just a good read.david"
1,A string of cliches that don't make sense,"There is really nothing about this book to recommend it. It is mostly a string of cliches attached to characters that don't make sense.I would agree with the book review that stated ""The result is yet another half-baked attempt to recapture the magic of Madison County."" That is really the only one of Waller's books worth reading. And yet he keeps spewing them out."
5,One of the best from Robert James Waller,Very good transaction. Excellent novel and the seller was excellent todeal with.
2,A mid-brow read,"Waller, why are you writing this stuff? You're an elderly gent,retired I assume, who made a bundle off the sugary-sweet andsappy BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY. Take the big money you madeand run brother--quit demonstrating your literary nincompoopismo!"
4,A New Chapter of Neo Tokyo,"The wind of change triggered by Akira's mega psychic wave has finally leveled Tokyo. In the wake of September 11th, reading this issue gives you tremendeous chill as how very bad it is to live in a post apocalyptic world. Great mirroring of our contemporary war-anxious world."
1,Waste of time and money,"This movie is a waste of time and money. It is supposed to be the story of solomon and is way off the mark. It's poor production, bad visual effects, and the sound quality is extremely rough (somewhat quiet at parts, and extremely loud in others). The only way that I can see the other reviewer of this movie giving it 5 stars is if was one of the actors or the Production company!!"
5,Makita impact.,"cant complain about this impact. have used it many of times with no complaints. very strong, durable impact. cant go wrong with a Mikita."
5,BTD142HW,I purchased the BTD142HW to remove screws and bolts from ten sections of high school bleachers. The unit performed flawlessly and even suprisingly in that it removed half inch lag bolts from the hardwood floors. The light was also useful when working on the undersides of the seats in the darker areas.
5,What to do without it ??,"I had been toying with the idea of buying an impact driver for some time, and I finally bought the Makita about 2 months ago. Since then, I forgot what it was like to not have this tool. Buy one!"
5,Best Impact EverMakita BTD142HW 18-Volt Compact Lithium-Ion Cordless Impact Driver Kit,"I have owned this makita for the last 4 yrs and have used it every day on one project or another. in short, to date it still has the power and force as the day I baught it over 4 yrs ago, And just now had to replace 1 of the 2 batteries the came with it when i purchased it 4yrs + ago. baught the other one with the 3.0 battery about 5yrs ago and it is still going strong as well."
3,Industry-wide poor design,"Good power and battery life, but all these Chicom driver/drills have the same problem: the directional switch is too close to the trigger finger, constantly being unintentionally bumped to the center (off) or the opposite direction. The reversing switch should be nowhere near the trigger finger. Imagine the huge sweatshop where all these tools are assembled, brands distinguished only by the colors of the plastic housings. Makita might get ball bearings, Harbor Freight bronze sleeves. Ain't globalization grand?"
2,Not as good as a Panasonic 6506,"I like that it has Li-Ion and a light. It is specified that it has considerably more torque than the Panasonic 6506 (1280 vs 867in-lbs), but it just can't drive screws as fast?My hunch is they exaggerated the what it does. It has a much lower price than the new Panasonic with similar ratings - there must be a reason that isn't shown in the specifications. Could be that the peak torque has less total energy - thus is drives much slower."
3,Ok but not enough to remove wheel lugs,I bought this at Home Depot to remove wheel lugs from my race car but it wasn't up to the task. It's rated at 100ft/lbs (1200 in lbs) and the lugs are tightened to 94 ft/lbs but it couldn't loosen them so I gotta find something with more torque.
4,Impact Driver has power to spare,"I've had the Makita BTD142HW-B impact driver for about a month and used it on a couple of projects. It has plenty of power for driving screws, but the variable speed trigger is a bit too sensitive for fine work. When I need muscle to drive screws, I use the impact driver. When precision is required, I use my Makita drill/driver to drive the screws. This impact driver would the perfect tool to use for building a deck!"
5,Excellent buy!!,"Hands down the best money I've ever spent on tools. It's very light, well balanced and powerful."
1,batteries are worthless,i had this drill for just over a year and haven't charged them more than 20 times and both batteries show bad per their charger. Being the batteries cost about as much as buying the drill i would say i'm disappointed to say the least as i was expecting more from Makita..
4,Belt Clip,Very nice driver but belt clip not included . Makes it unhandy about 60 % of the time . Thought that was kind of cheap on Makitas thinking.
4,Primus is great!,"Primus is great, and great fun to play. These tabs for the most part are accurate. Some songs are not, but close enough that you'll get it. I really only have two problems, one is that some songs that are listed and tabed as played on a 6 string bass, are actually played on a 4. This is only a little bad because some songs sound better on a six, and are more fun. Problem two is a little one, and one you probably wont share. I hate that they include the traditional music, if you can read music you would want a music book not a tab book. It cludders the book up and takes up space that could have been used for other songs."
2,"Not the original ""Mack the Knife""","I ordered this cd because it had ""Dream Lover"", ""Splish Splash"", and ""Mack the Knife."" However, the ""Mack"" song is live and it is not indicated on the cd. It's just not the same."
4,nice very nice,this is one of my favorite cds. bobby's live recording of mack the knife is the best!!!! 18 yellow roses is truly a sweet melody. i listen to this cd at least a couple times a week.
2,I was disappointed,"While some of the songs on this album sound like the original arrangements, many are not. I was most disappointed with Darin's most famous song, Mack the Knife. It's a live performance and very jarring if you're expecting the old tried and true version. A few of the songs are good but overall, I've heard better."
3,Good CD!,"This is the first Bobby Darin CD I bought, and it's a good one. It greatly spans the depth of Bobby's vocal range, and singing career. His voice had no limits. It starts off with ""Splish Splash"" and ""Dream Lover"", both well known favorites. Then, it heads into ""18 Yellow Roses"", another classic favorite, and a hipper version of ""On Broadway."" There are live versions from the early '70s of ""Mack the Knife"" (this was his favorite version), and ""If I Were a Carpenter"". I think they come from the ""Live at the Desert Inn"" CD, from 1971. The real show-stopper is ""Happy"". It's a beautiful song Bobby sings with strong feeling and passion. The only downside is it does not say the performances of ""Mack the Knife"" and ""If I Were A Carpenter"" are live. Beware of that before you buy it. Add it to your collection."
3,Kitty Kat Condo Missing Something,"My Kitty Kat Kondo arrived filthy dirty and missing most of the instruction label that is affixed to the entrance. No instructions were included and the label on the box says ""Item 25701"" My order was for ""Item 25702"". It sounds like I may have gotten an older model. Very disappointed but it's cold outside and I need this item to keep a stray cat warm, and can't wait for a replacement to come."
3,OKAY FOR WHAT I NEEDED,The product was delivered as described. Had a little bit of trouble getting the dome to align with the base but with a little elbow grease I got it done without having to have my Husband help me....My cat has enjoyed it a few times but during the summer heat he prefers to stay outside of it since it can heat up inside. I did have to wash the bottom part but with a little Dawn liquid and a hose it removed the smell and clean it nice. Just let it dry i the sun. We'll see how it does int he winter months.
3,Worth keeping....but not by much,"This item arrived in a large outer box, floating with no inside bag or packaging. It consists of the top and the base, solid plastic, which fit together fine.My major complaint with this item is that it does not include the front door, which is most likely just a piece of rubber that would fit into the two holes and swing. For the price, it should be included.Also, the measurements led me to believe that the MEDIUM Lectro-Kennel heating pad would fit perfectly....but it does not...you will need the SMALL size.Otherwise I am satisfied so far, and Homie is breaking it in nicely."
4,Cold Weather Protector,The Kitty Condo is a great buy for the price.. I looked at similar Igloo (Doghouses) at local retailers in my area and found that Amazon offered a Better deal in regards to price and size. The shipping time was less than a week and my cat almost can't believe he now has a home so comfortable! My only request is that the door should be included but for the most part I am quite satisfied!
4,Kitty Kat Condo,"I sets u easy, and works fine. I'd like to see some sort of very soft flexible doorway cover on however.I find it amuzing the the vert cover is labeled ""Dggieloo"" as well."
3,Does what it says - just,"It's ok - the cat likes it well enough. Shipment was crudely packaged and hard to open. The top doesn't fit the base very well - it's warped. Since all it has to do is sit there, it works. Can't pick it up except by the base. I wouldn't buy another one."
3,Base is not sturdy,"The base of the product is not that sturdy....I tried to fit it with the help of a screw but it didn't help. However, after putting it on patio floor, didn't notice any issues.The seller should have checked the product before shipping."
1,Shipping Difficulty,The first one I received showed up with no box and without the bottom.I did an exchange and the second one came in a box but the connectors that attach the top to the bottom were broken.I plan on writing the manufacturer to see what they have to say about it. It is an awesome little house if it would be constructed a bit better they way it attaches
1,not as good as it looks,"This case from Speck has many pros and cons, however I think the cons outweigh the pros.PROS:-The bottom folds up for docking, updating, and charging-The screen protector does a very good job-Hold switch, headphone jack, and click wheel are not covered, and therefore easy to use-The surface is grippy, so it doesn't slide aroundCONS:-Because of the grippy surface, it is very hard to put in your pocket-Though preventing scratches, it dulls the finish of the iPod-At the place where the bottom folds up, it leaves a line on the iPod surface that is very, very hard to get off-If the screen protector moves, it could easily damage the screen. The grippy strips that keep it in place will leave marks on the screen.-The case pulls away from the screen protector at the top, which I found very annoying. There was no way to prevent this.-If you remove it, it is easy to accidentally leave marks on the screen and the rest of the iPod"
1,Just doesn't fit well,"This just doesn't fit well. It's a nice idea but the screen protector is designed such that the case pulls away from the screen. It probably would still protect the ipod ok, but looks bad! I eventually replaced it with a DIO Leather flip case (WAY Nicer!)..."
2,Lite on Flavor........,"Low-fat/fat-free versions of fave restaurant items like Red Lobster's Cheddar Bay Biscuits, White Castle Cheeseburgers, Boston Market's Cinnamon Apples and Olive Garden's homemade Italian Dressing. The dishes in this book definitely don't taste like the restaurant versions of the same thing, but what can one expect when you extract most/all of the fat, which, I hate to say it, is what gives fast-food it's flavor. I have only used this book four times and have owned it for over 8 years. If you are a die-hard fast-food junkie and want to eat healthier and don't mind skimping on flavor a bit, then this is the book for you. If not, save your money."
4,Create Healthier Versions of Foods You Crave,"The recipes in this book are great. It's fun to create your favorite restaurant items at home, especially when you know the ingredients are fresh, and healthy for you! I haven't experienced a bad recipe yet, but you must keep in mind that removing a lot of the fat will not make it taste exactly like the real thing. Trading the negative ingredients for a great-tasting positive is OK by me! The only downfall is that some of the ingredients may not be easily found at home, and there are a lot of steps in the preparation of many recipes. This book is an excellent tool to help calm those ""no-no"" food cravings we get while dieting!"
5,Adorable Costume!,"I was surprised at the high quality of this Halloween costume! So many costumes are kind of flimsy; this one is well made, lots of nice details and will hold up through a lot of my 4 year old son't abuse. It's not even Halloween and he's worn it many times already and it still looks brand new. Easy to clean too, and it fits him perfectly! Thank you, it continues to make me smile! Susan"
2,Seller is less than forthcoming about this product.,"The costume is fine (not spectacular), but the seller was less than forthcoming about what they were selling. This is a Rubies costume. Based on the picture which looks significantly different than the Rubies costume; the price; the seller's representation that this was a BOS (I learned later that is Brands On Sale), not Rubies, costume; and the stellar review posted, we thought we were buying a high-end, spectacular costume. You can find this same costume a million other places for much less money."
4,"Not Really for Spies, Cops, and Locksmiths","John Minnery has written something of a standard book on the subject of (lock)pick guns. If one surfs the interent for this subject, most often one will find this book and no other. But the book is not all that much about techniques. Rather most of the book, though not all, is descriptions of some of the various pick guns that have been made.Minnery's pick gun made from a coat hanger caught my attention. It's easy to make and I think it works better than the standard mechanical pick gun offered by Southhord and others. Also the pick gun made from a Dremel jigsaw tool caught my interest. Something that Minnery does not mention is making a pick gun out of a non-oscillating electric toothbrush.I know a locksmith that keeps a pick gun on a charger in his service truck. And I know one who told me he used one so seldom that he wasn't sure if the charger worked. They are not a guarantee that one will be able to pick a lock. So much of this depends on practice."
3,different and not as good,"I ordered to replace broken pieces. The molds have been changed, so the plates no longer stack properly.The quality is still pretty good, except for the salad bowls. They're a markedly paler blue than the rest of the set. I'm keeping them because I have no options, other than buying used ones at a much higher price. Disappointed they're no longer made in England, with appropriate quality control."
4,The best ever,This book was the bomb! Even though Andie is now with Joey in the show. It was nice to read the book.
1,Better go elsewhere for help,"Unless you believe that there really are such things as brain farts and brain viruses (pleeease, let's not dilute the real meaning of the word virus, computer viruses are enough), I highly recommend that you buy something based on real science, not pseudoscience, such as NLP. It is bad enough that there are already so many people in this world who are followers of NLP."
5,Ghost is now truly visible,Ghost has Proven once again why he is one of the best entertainers in the world because of hardwork and dedication.the album is nice it is a muct have.
1,Total Disappointment....!,"Bad graphics, bad build features, etc....as a matter of fact, I didn't find one thing I liked about this product except for the glossy box presentation...as for me, it was $ wasted....!!"
1,Sad Excuse for a Game,"The game is supposed to simulate ""model"" rail-roading not a real train. However this poor title not only is no fun to play it has a terrible interface.The levels pose little effort to complete. The worst challenge is getting simple ""layouts"" to connect end-to-end. Forget anything complicated for ""model railroading"" as this game will only torment you to frustration.My money is much better spent on a real game like one of Sid Meier's fine railroad games. Isn't the point of a ""train game"" to simulate a real train or rail-road building experience -and- be FUN to PLAY?"
4,"Great, but not as great as...","No, perhaps this doesn't have the ""sparkle"" and depth of Verbruggen's first, landmark recording of the cello suites (still available, suites 1-3 on Harmonia Mundi Franc - #7907071), which are truly incredible. But that may just be that the bloom has faded from me and the surprise and awe I felt at first encounter with that first CD. But this release still has treasures awaiting anyone who loves the suites and exploring Bach's capacity for nuance. Much clearer than with bowed or plucked strings, I think. Like organ music, but only with a virtuoso musician playing with the heart of Bach."
4,Cello Suites,"Marion Verbruggen has done what I believe to be the first recorded transcription of the famous Cello Suites of Bach for flute.The playing is actually quite clear and very well-paced, but sadly, lacks the emotional depth which one feels when listening to this in its original cello format. This is the only reservation I have for this recording, but for any Bach enthusiasts like myself, it is indispensable as a recording primarily for its novelty. I do however suggest that you listen to the Cello Suites of Casals, Jaap ter Linden, or Mstislav Rostropovich before you buy this CD, so as to have a deeper appreciation for this musical piece. You might also want to look into the transcription of this piece for Lute done by Hopkinson Smith before trying this CD out."
3,thin but cute,I liked how the earrings looked on my ears...they just came off too easily. I have some active grand kids who play ruff. The clasp on the earrings did not hold tight enough. I wear them when I am not around active kids.
1,too bad,I recently purchase the Hp 5270 & I was dissatisfied. The DVD/CDRW would not open no matter how often I tried. I returned the computer to the store & tried the display units & found that they would occasionally would not open. I tried to open the DVD several times & on each display unit (2) there was a problem. I finally opt for a Toshiba laptop. Otherwise I did like the computer but the DVD is an important part of a computer.
5,GREAT COMPILATION OF HAWAIIAN KUPUNA KNOWLEDGE,"THIS IS A FANTASTIC COMPILATION OF INTERVIEWS ABOUT CRITICAL ASPECTS IN HAWAII. IT ALLOWS YOU TO FEEL LIKE YOU JUST SPOKE TO LOCAL HAWAIIANS AND REALLY GET INSIGHT INTO THEIR POLITICS, SPIRITUALITY, CUSTOMS, ETC. IT IS WELL WRITTEN AND A FUN READ. IT HAS HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL WHO LIVE IN OR VISIT HAWAII (TOURIST, PERSONAL, OR ACADEMIC). AN EXCELLENT REFERENCE."
1,"BEWARE! Not the classic cartoon director, just a TV rip-off!","This is NOT the Tex Avery of the classic MGM, Warner Brothers, & Walter Lantz Cartoon fame. This is a cheap TV show, released by DIC, ripping off the classic cartoon director's name and shamelessly using it for its main character & series name.You will NOT find the classic Droopy here!You will NOT find the classic Little Red here!You will NOT find the classic City Wolf here!You will NOT find the classic Screwy Squirrel here!You will NOT find the classic Lenny & George here!You will NOT find full classic animation here!You will find yourself using this DVD as a practice target.For the real TEX AVERY experience, get these DVDs!Tex Avery's Droopy - The Complete Theatrical CollectionLooney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume OneLooney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume TwoLooney Tunes - Golden Collection, Volume ThreeThe Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection"
1,This isn't Tex Avery,"The cartoons on this DVD are ""in Tex Avery's style."" That is, they've used many of the tropes Avery did -- fast action, sexy women, (allegedly) goofy characters -- but managed to avoid anything resembling humor. The cartoons are annoying at best but more like painful to watch.There are plenty of collections of Avery's ACTUAL work on this site and elsewhere. Don't waste time or money with this."
4,These cartoons are hilarious,"These cartoons are from the ""Wacky World of Tex Avery"" series that ran on TV in the late '90's. They are done in the ""Tex Avery"" style - stretching characters, popping eyeballs, shattering teeth, etc - and have new and original characters, such as ""Tex Avery"", ""Power Pooch"", Pompeii Pete"", ""Freddy the Fly"" (my favorite), and ""Einstone"" the cave-genius. If you love funny animation and frantic story-telling these cartoons will be sure to bring lots of laughs. I've got them all, and frankly, I think the other reviewers are shockingly ignorant. Anybody who loves and follows animation knows these shows and recognises them as totally original and very funny."
1,The unit I received is totally inaccurate,"From the other reviews, I can only assume that I got a defective scale. It reads between 1.5 and 2 times the value I get from a digital postal scale as well as another brand of handheld scale that is very similar to this one.For me, it was a total waste of money since I can't trust it at all. If the error is not linear, then I can not even cut the reading in half to make an estimate.It is not worth my time to return the item, so in the trash it went."
3,SMALL HAND-HELD POSTAL SCALE,"The postal scale works, but is rather difficult to handle. I have been using mine regularly to see if I can become better athandling it, and I suppose that I am -- but it is still so small that it is hard to get an envelope into the grip and to read theweight. I find the weight numbers badly inscribed.SMALL HAND-HELD POSTAL SCALE"
4,good for less,"for the money they work great. Of the three I bought mine seams to be right on the weight. I gave the others to friends, no complants."
4,Portable Postal Scale,"This little device is simple to use and accurate enough for weighing envelopes. It's small, portable and looks cool too. If you want higher tech or greater weight scale, get the OXO Good Grips scale. But for deciding how much postage to stick on an envelope, this is all you need."
1,"cheap peice of junk, add a hook & it might make a good lure","got to to fill in for a $25 super saver free shipping, would have been better off paying the shipping, I plan on adding a hook on it and using it as a lure."
1,handheld postal scale,"It's a great little handheld postal scale, which I had bought previously in a local stationery store. I never received my order from this seller, despite several contacts. The money (<$10) was not the issue. Seller unreliable!"
2,Too good to be true,"This wig, while inexpensive is not of high quality. The fibers are frizzy and cheap. It would be okay to wear for a halloween party, but if you are looking for a long, silky, wig this is not the wig for you."
2,Petroleum Jelly,Ingredients aren't listed on the jar and I didn't see them on the sellers page but this stuff is basically petroleum jelly.
3,"Helpful approach to vocabulary, but be careful!","The Gimmick series uses a technique of learning several synonyms/antonyms at once to increase vocabulary rapidly, and that is very helpful. But two MAJOR cautions about this book:1. Some of the answers in the back and some of the definitions themselves are wrong. Often the wrong person of the verb is given in the answers, and I have run across at least one completely incorrect verb definition. Furthermore, when the author teaches vulgar terms (part of the gimmick) her English definitions often fail to capture the offensiveness of the Spanish words.2. The lack of a complete glossary and the author's habit of using words not yet introduced in the exercises make the translation drills tedious.That said, this is an interesting review of Spanish basics for people who already know some Spanish. Despite the author's claim in the introduction, it is difficult to use this book to learn Spanish from scratch all by yourself."
1,"There are much better ""Teach Youself"" guides out there...","If you are looking to teach yourself Spanish, I do not recommend this book. Unlike most guides, this book is designed for someone who already has knowledge of the language, although it advertises itself as a book for beginners and those with no background. Instead try Spanish the Easy Way by Barrons."
4,"For Reviewing Spanish, It's Great!","Adrienne's ""Spanish in 32 Lessons"" is a good review book for re-learning Spanish. I emphasize the word ""review."" It does have drawbacks for someone who has never spoken a word of Spanish [such as no pronunciation guide], but for one who already knows the simple, logical rules of Spanish pronunciation, so what? It is nicely arranged in 32 chapters that can be used as weekly self-teaching ""courses"" if that is one's goal. It teaches the basic essentials and makes no bones about the fact that it is not a complete text, but does have the ability for anyone to start using those first halting words and phrases.I especially like its compact size such that on my morning bus commute to work, I can easily review a chapter and pick up a few more commonly used words/""modismos"" that either I'm not acquainted with or have not used in a number of years.This reasonably priced book, for those especially wishing to review Spanish, is well worth the money."
3,"Some Good Elements, but Whoa to the Publishers","""Spanish in 32 Lessons"" is not well-laid out or organized; it is harsh on the reader. I can confirm the other commentators' observations that it has a substantial amount of mistakes and typos. Also, it contains no pictures or commentary. Still, after I checked it out of the library, I decided to buy it, chiefly for two reasons. In one recurring type of table, a word or phrase is presented, and then 1) a translation, 2) an associated synonym (word or phrase), and 3) an antonym (word or phrase) are given. Also, at the end, there are separate extensive lists of verbs & prepositions (phrases) and of idioms. These aspects of the book are valuable for expanding vocabulary and learning how words work in context and in combinations. The other stuff -- noun and verb lists, conjugations, and miscellaneous grammar and language points -- is OK, but the lack of organization (or an index) means you do not know where anything is."
4,Blind Rage,"This movie was a decent watch. Purists once again got uptight about Daredevil's suit, which wasn't too bad. Still, Daredevil, the Kingpin, Hulkie, that's enough for any Marvel fan. (And this movie is dirt cheap!)"
4,More DareDevil than Hulk,"Even though this movie seems to focus on DareDevil rather than ol' Jade Jaws its still cool. DareDevil's origin is pretty much untouched, however his suit got redesigned... istead of his red suit, he has a Black one, with no DD and no Horns... kinda reminds me of Snake eyes from GI Joe. Any way this movie is sure to satisfy die hard comic fans, especially those into Marvel."
4,Bill and Lou-The Indredible Hulk,"I remember as a kid watching the Hulk series. Tis is a typical follow up of the series starring Bill Bixby as the human form sort of speaking, and Lou Fierrgo as the monstrous Hulk. Any fan of the hulk or marvel comic book series should enjoy this story about Bill Bixby's challenge to control the Hulk within. I dont feel i should include any spoilers since this is a classic worth seeing and two thumbs up for it anyday. The reason for a 4 star rating is due to the lack of the suspence and a too predictable story line. Like the series you can always sort of forsee the plot before it happens, but never the less its worth viewing for fans of all ages. Cheers"
3,Heavy Industrial Sound,"I gave them 3 stars because I haven't actually listened to the album in its entirety, but the songs that I've listened to are quite good. This band sounds more industrial sounding than metal, which is quite obvious when you listen to the title track which stands out with its heavy industrial techno sound (which is not a bad think). The lead singers voice is not bad for this type of music. If you enjoy listening to bands like The Kovenant then I'm sure you'll enjoy Deathstars."
4,Very interesting book.,"I really liked this book. I found it to be a very ""smart"" book. Its definitely not wicca 101. The personal experiences with the dieties made me want to explore my own paganism. The only problem that I have with this book is Judy Harrows' chapter. In my opinion she was a little rude when it came to her own practices. It is obvious that she does not believe that the gods are literal beings but she seems to convey it in such a way that she is practicing ""real"" paganism as opposed to the fake reconstructionists. Overall I would say buy this book."
5,Clifford entertains!,"My 4 & 5 year old daughters have been playing this one for a year now. It has never hit the bottom of the CD game pile! It is fun, while it teaches - which is the best part! You search for 4 jewels while you try to get things done for Clifford's party. There are games along the way as well as thinking adventures. One game involves sorting grocery items into their correct places on the shelves - which helps teach counting and spatial skills. There are plenty of activities to keep your child busy, and teach them something too! I highly recommend this one! Who doesn't love Clifford! ""Woof!"""
3,great game but disk vibrates badly while playing,"This is a great game - my 5 year old loves it. It's irritating that the disk is so off-center that it vibrates badly in the PC drive. It made so much noice that it disturbed other passengers on a noisy airplane. I finally copied it onto a new blank disk just to quiet it down. They really should have better manufacturing standards. Otherwise, we love the game."
1,WILL NOT WORK WITH MAC,Even though this item stated it would work with mac- it will not. I have both an older powerbook G4 and a brand new imac quad core- and it will not work with either one. it states on the back will work with mac OS 7.5.3-9.2 - Since my powerbook is over 4 years old this means it will only work with VERY old macs. So now the only way my daughter will be able to play it is if we feel like booting the imac in windows. Much more trouble than I wanted to go too for a game for her.
1,Does not work on Mac,"This is an old game, does not work well on XP and will not load at all on my new powerbook MAC as it has an Intel chip. I wasted my money and my daughter is upset...beware."
1,Not compatible with Mac OS x,"This product was a real disappointment since it only runs in Classic, It will not run on OSX, even if Classic is installed."
3,Clifford the Big Red Dog game,"This is a game that I thought my grandchildren would really love and it was just OK. They did play it but not as much as I thought they would. Maybe it is just them, but they were not highly entertained."
1,Does not work with Mac!!,If you don't have an old pc don't waste your money. We luckily got it to work on our pc laptop that is 10 years old...but not on our macs.
4,Good Educational game,"This was bought for my 4 year old granddaughter. I only watched her try to do the adventures the first time she played it. She seemed to like it. Her mom says she is still playing the game even after 6 months. I think it's a good educational game which is why I bought it. Delivery was prompt and the game was in good working condition, but it's case was broken in some areas. That should have been better. We were lucky the game worked fine."
4,Clifford,"I picked up a used copy of this and installed it so my nephew could try it when he came over. He absolutely loved it. His eyes bugged out when he saw it and he gets little experience on a computer so far so this was very eductaional for him as well, in that respect."
4,Learning Games,It is an excellent tool to help engage your kids in thinking and learning creatively.
2,"""Hooked on a Feeling"" NOT the original Blue Swede #1 US hit","Don't know where they dredged up ""Hooked on a Feeling"", but I've never heard this re-do before.You have to be careful with these Curb compilations. They ain't Rhino or Hip-O.Also, they could have filled up the CD to make it a better value. 12 cuts? Only about a half-hour of music."
1,No preview,CD 22 HITS i WOULD NOT BUY IF IT HAD A PREVIEW. AFTER THIS EVEN I WILL NOT PURHASE A CD UNLESS IT HAS A PREVIEW.
4,great records of the decade cd,fast efficient shipping is greatly appreciated. the music quality was good and satisfactory.
4,No MP3 on DVD-R,"While the overall on this receiver is near to excellent, it's good to let others know that this head unit, top of the line for 2 din in pioneers mobile entertainment, DOES NOT PLAY MP3 RECORDED ON DVD-R as other low end head units do.ProsNice graphics and interfaceParametric EQ6 Disc DVD changerEasy to set UpInstallation cables detachable (if not in use, ex A/V in, A/V out, etc.)ConsMP3 recorded on DVD-R are non playableDiscs inside changer are not identifiable you have to memorize themInformation about the files should be longerTricky installation for parking brake safety featureHope this helps."
3,"Good recipes, not enough photos","Charmaine Solomon has some of the best receipes for the novice Thai cook. This book is full of her wonderful recipes that if followed carefully will never fail to help you produce quite an impressive feast. However, this book also comes in a hard cover edition that has not only similar or better recipes but also many more good photographs to inspire you by. This book literally pales in comparison, hence the three stars."
1,Pure Liberal Lies And Hatred,"This is a hate-filled book written by a closed-minded liberal who has only one goal, which is to attack, attack, attack.... It's the same thing we've seen numerous times, which is: If you have no message of your own, make personal attacks on your opponents. It's Carvillian in that it makes no attempt whatsoever to be engaging on the issues, instead spending it's time spewing the author's personal hatred of our current President.Save your money, I read it, and I my time would have been better spent hitting my head against a wall repeatedly. Pure garbage."
5,Couldn't have hoped for more!,"I got my Graphire thinking I would only use it for drawing, but I'm so in love with it now that I use it for everything! It works great as a drawing tablet, but also seconds as a mouse for me and is great for presentations. The easy-access buttons work really well and the pressure sensitivity works perfect in The GIMP. (Note: I use Linux - Debian, Sabayon and Ubuntu - and it worked out of the box). I would highly recommend this product to everyone!"
5,Great!,"I've drawn on the computer for years using the mouse, and finally decided to try out a tablet; I will never go back to the mouse now. I love my tablet. It's very sensitive to pressure and works great! I'd definitely recommend this product!"
4,"Great, but...","I have rather large hands, as in most large size gloves don't fit me, and I find that the diameter of the pen could be increased by a millimeter or two for my person comfort. The buttons are also a little small and close together, again only a problem because of my long fingers. The action is very sharp and sensitive which is why I'll never use another regular mouse again."
5,I love my tablet!,"I have not had my tablet very long, but I am already adjusting to it, I have found it to be very easy to use, although I can still draw a little better with a pencil. It makes coloring with photoshop much easier, and is a great tool for those of us without enough money for a larger tablet or a tablet PC."
3,Play the game with a friend,"This game is not as bad as the other 2 reviews make it out to be. As far as turn based games go on Xbox, I think theres this and that dai saiku game and thats it. This game features destructable environments, weapon unlocks, and while attacking with say a rifle it switches to a first person perspective so the amount of damage is based on how well you aim. It really is an inventive game, dont judge this game by its graphics thats like judging a book by its cover. And as the title states play this game with a friend and it will be a much more enjoyable experience."
1,garbage,"I know calling a game garbage is pretty severe, but you have to understand Future Tactics Uprising is really bad. There was no reason to release this game.You have hardly no options at all during strategy battles, and the graphics are pretty bad and blocky. Not what you'd expect from the Xbox.I hope you don't buy this game. You'd be better off without it."
3,It is a Gasket but NOT a Drain Plug,"I just want to warn buyers that the title is WRONG. This package only contains 2 gaskets. The title says ""Oil Drain Plug AND Gasket"". I know the pictures didn't show a plug, but from the title I thought that it was included. You are now warned so don't order this is you want both."
2,Mediocre,"A big step down from ""On"". In fact, there is only real two ""good"" songs on it. At its worst it sounds like Night Ranger or Billy Squier."
5,Good Machining,"Good machining, wrench maintains size. Shifter is not too tight or loose. No surprises, will buy again. Does not scratch bathroom fixtures."
3,Hmmm....it's alright.......,"The main character was a great tough take no prisoners individual. A CIA agent Reese Whitiaker goes undercover in a terrorist organization for one thing and finds out there is a bigger problem. Reese is constantly tested and holds her own. She is coming off of the loss and contemplating divorcing her other half who also is a CIA agent. The flow of the book was okay, I wasn't riveted, but I do wish there was more interaction on the romance part with the two characters. The majority of the book concentrated on Reese and her missions, including a mission to save her husband. I don't know if this can be constituted as romance, but it was okay if you like a strong female character."
3,City of Rocks Idaho,"In response to the critics of my City of Rocks guide, it is still the most accurate and complete guide on the market. The book began as a self -published labor of love in 1985 and, like the City, has been constantly evolving. I have been working on a new, fully updated, all-photo guide which will be out by fall '03. Until then, the 2001 edition of ""City of Rocks, Idaho - A Climber's Guide"" provides the most accurate maps and route information of the area."
1,Huh?,"Its time for serious update. This guy has been rebublishing the same stuff for years. You might as well buy the first edition for nickels since nothing really has changed. Difficult to follow topo's, bad trail info, and lack of info are just a few of the problems with this book. Maybe used in conjunction with Calderone's book you'll get a good idea about the climbs, otherwise go without and ask around and you'll most likely get better info."
3,I wondered why shopping was so important,"This is a good read, certainly for those interested in history. It was a bit light and wasn't helpful in terms of marketing or research, but interesting none the less."
5,Great Book For Shoppers and Sociologists,"I loved this book. Every page was filled with interesting facts I did not previously know. Who knew the word Muzak was invented in the 1930s? Not me. I was constantly reading passages aloud to whoever was nearby to hear, (my mother, my best friend, my boss, a random student in the Starbuck's).I would suggest this book for anyone interested in the socio-cultural aspects and impact of shopping."
4,Good book,"Another great novel!I love all of her books, this one just fits in with the rest. I recommend it."
1,home again,"I have read the majority of all the Kristen Hanna books and absolutely loved them. Then along came Home Again!!! Hanna what happened.? I would say that 80% of the pages in the book had the word ""tears"" on it. After a while it got to me a game as to how long it would be before Iread that word again. How many times can you stroke a cheek?? Don't bother spending your money. I total waste."
3,Home Again: A Novel,I love reading Kristin Hannah's books but this one seemed very short and almost pushed to finish it.Somewhat disappointing.
1,Totally predictable and corny!,"Her more recent books are better, but she' still reads like a soap opera. For when you have nothing better to do!"
4,"Home Again, A Novel","It was good, but too predictable before you got very far into it, you knew what was going to be the ending."
3,Leased liked,"I have read numerous Krisitn Hannah books, usually can't put them down but this one is very dark and depressing. There was only one other book of hers I didn't like the rest I have loved."
4,storyteller,"This is the second Kristin Hannah novel I've read. I enjoy the way she uses words and her phrasing. Her use of nouns as verbs etc. I wondered how Madeline's friends and the church felt about Madelaine and Francis's (a priest) relationship. The fact that he loved her and they both knew it. Nothing ever happened between them but there was still that little bit of intrigue. Angel, Francis's younger brother, is the classic bad boy who became famous after leaving his family, pregnant girlfriend and trailer park life behind for ten thousand dollars. The circumstances that brought him back is truly karmic. The same thing seems to happen in real life. The good, kind people who have their priorities straight to begin with, somehow get the short end of the stick. However, their pain seems to aid the truly lost to find their way in their convoluted world. I seldom read a book that makes me cry but this one did. Good read!"
2,Maybe it's not for everybody . . . .,"Okay, I'll be the holdout here; I just didn't really enjoy this book that much. It's the first Kristin Hannah book I've read, and will probably also be the last. Yes, all the characters are flawed and real, but the truth is that they have so many weaknesses and problems and issues that for about the first three quarters of the book they nearly drove me crazy! I just didn't LIKE these people much at all, and the story seemed very dark. The last quarter of the book becomes more hopeful and focused on possibility, but by then these folks may have worn you out. And even though I am a recipient of donated tissue myself, I found it pretty hard to empathize with some of Angel's fears."
4,Heartwarming..predictable,"This was a truly enjoyable and heartwarming book, despite its predictability within the middle of the novel. It involves the struggles of a single mom who happens to be a hardworking cardiologist, her rebellious child, their faithful friend, and a celebrity. The chapters alternate between the lives of these four well-developed characters whose lives drastically change throughout the span of the novel. The main character's daughter, Lina, comes off as a whiny teenager at some points, but she realizes the love her mother has for her. Although he does not seem to realize the sacrifices her mother had made for them, she accepts and acknowledges her own faults. The celebrity, Angel, whose name is truly an antithesis of his personality, is a dynamic character who changes due to circumstances affecting his life dealing with mortality, family, and love"
3,Enjoyable easy read,"This is the first book I have read by Kristin Hannah, and I enjoyed it enough to order two others. I enjoyed the storyline of the mom and rebellious teenage daughter, and I felt the storyline with the two brothers and the donated heart was very touching. Kristin could have left out the dead brother ghost action, I didn't feel it was necessary. The book was easy to read, not the best that I have read, but still very enjoyable."
3,Storyline and ending do not seem original,I have read many of the authors books and was disappointed with this one. Ending and storyline were very unoriginal.
4,Great!,This book was moving & poignant. Made me think what would I do. I enjoyed the honesty in the book.
5,Easy and fun read.,A great read. Starts slow but in the end it is a great book. I laughed and even cried. Must read
1,Achtung: Kauft Nicht!,"Most of the speeches on this video are cribbed from _Triumph of the Will_ The editors attempt to be slick by saying something to the tune of: ""Hitler delivers an important address to the German Nation,"" when in fact it is just another speech to the party at the 1934 rally. I wish some reviewer would have mentioned this before I bought it.Also, the picture and sound quality is atrocious. Just get the the DVD of _TOTW_ and forget this garbage."
3,"Not long enough, bad picture quality, but nice speeches","This video is too short - about 50 minutes. The picture quality also leaves something to be desired - I have seen clips of the same speeches on The History Channel that were of much better quality. On the plus side, it does contain the best parts of many of Hitler's most important speeches."
2,another boring speech,"I bought this video to see how exactly Hitler convinced the Germans in his speeches that Jews were evil or why what he was doing was okay. In fact the term ""the Jews"" Hitler never even uses once. It's a bunch of boring speeches that have nothing to do with anything. He speaks of how Germany's youth is Germany's future and it should be as strong as steel to a young German audience. He says nothing controversial or outrageous or inflammatory."
2,works but not what I was hoping for,I was hoping that these would clip on my eyeglasses but they do not. The quality and finish is good I just wish they fit my glases better. I still use them but if I lean forward they will fall off.
3,"Low Back Disorders, 2nd edition","I rated this text as just OK (3 stars)because it is really a textbook for physical therapists, not a manual for patients trying to improve their low back. It israther technical and written for the physical therapist, giving instructions to the physical therapist such as ""YOU should have the patient do such and such."" The text is not directed to the patient. As a textbook for physical therapists, it is probably excellent (5 stars)."
4,"Technical and scientifically detailed, but very good!","Like the title says, very good and interesting book, but not a very easy read. I would recommend first reading Rick Jemmett's book on Spinal Stabilization and only after that giving this a try.Anyway, I loved this book and immediately ordered also McGill's other book! Can hardly wait to get it as well... :-)"
3,Question re 2002 vs. 2007,"I see that both editions link to the same collection of reviews. Has anyone compared the two editions, or do you know what the difference is? The older one is cheaper."
3,Very technical,I suppose you'd have to be really interested in research to rate this five stars. For practical application I found it somewhat limited.
3,A slight stumble in the Kihn cycle,"Sorry, Greg--this one didn't work for me particularly well. There was quite a bit of dancing about architecture that I don't think worked as well as the filmmaking anecdotes from ""Horror Show"" or ""Big Rock Beat"". The 'twist' ending was exceptionally unsatisfying to me, and I just plain didn't enjoy this as much as the first two books in the series.I will, of course, buy the next one. I like Kihn's writing style enough to give this book a cautious recommendation, and for fans of the blues I recommend this highly. Add a star to the review if you're a John Lee Hooker fan."
2,I Had to Buy the Whole CD to Get the One Good Song It Contained.,"If you are an avid fan of Billy Swan, you need read no further. I'll confess right up front that I am not. However, I ran across his version of ""I Can Help"", and fell in love with it. It's apparent that the time-honored tradition of packaging one or (if you're lucky) two hits on a disk, then filling the rest with garbage, is alive and well. The remainder of the songs are at least passable, rather than terrible, and I knew going in what I would get. For me, at least, the one good song was worth it."
5,"Extraordinary lives, extraordinary language","I am impressed by the literary quality of the writing. There is delight in the discriptive words Dan Tripps selects so that his portrait of each of his subjects is unique. He has a gift for setting the place and time and for making his subjects three-dimensional. Tripps introduces us to the person behind the scenes, behind the celebrity. Like a coach, he shows empathy for his subjects' struggles while applauding their achievement and encouraging us likewise to achieve. I highly recommend this book not only for its uplifting content, but also for its aesthetically satisfying language."
3,Worth reading,"The concept for the book is great, and the author has interviewed some very interesting people that have done amazing things. The only problems I found with the book were that the author sometimes injected his own world hypotheses into the text, and that he often added a pithy quote and/or a lauding comment at the end of a profile, when a simple quote from the person would have done just fine. Overall, worth reading, though."
3,Just OK,"The camera is small and attractive. The daylight pictures are great, as they are with all Olympus cameras. Flash pictures are lame unless you are within 8 feet of the subject. It comes with many pre-settings but most are useless without a tripod. The built-in lithium ion battery lasts FOREVER, which helps offset the fact you have to charge it in its own little cradle. Downloading pictures to your computer is a little annoying-- it wants you to use the Olympus Master software that comes with the camera. But, once you attach it using the USB cable, the computer treats it like another external drive and you can just pluck the pix off that way. Finally, shutter lag is a major downside for me. It feels like a full 2 seconds. There's also a ""movie"" option-- it takes low-res movie, a feature I personally could do without. But overall, no complaints about picture quality, which is the bottom line, isn't it?"
4,Pretty Good.,"I think it's a nice little camera for the price. Takes pretty good pictures both indoor and outdoor. Movies are good only if recorded outdoors in the sunlight, also high quality sound recording. My only concern is the plastic body of the camera which I didn't realize it was plastic untill I received it, which makes the camera kind of fragile and not very practical - gotta be very careful with it especially if it's in your pocket. But so far I've been happy with it as my party going or taking around everyday camera."
3,"The Rogue Squadron Tetralogy, Book 3","I understand that this series was capitalizing on the popularity of a computer game, but it would have been better if it didn't have the title of ""X-Wing.""That minor beef aside, the first 4 books of this series form a tetralogy featuring the exploits of the ace starfighter squadron. For post-Return of the Jedi novels that are not about Luke, Han and Leia, these books are not bad.As for the best novels from the era of the movie saga, I highly recommend the following 5-star novels:Cloak of Deception (Star Wars)Shadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul)Labyrinth of Evil (Star Wars, Episode III Prequel Novel)Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (Star Wars)Shadows of the Empire (Star Wars)"
5,A Good Book!,"Although there are few battle scenes, the book is good. Since the trial of Tycho Celchu is one of the biggest things in the book, it is important to understand that if you don't like that part, there are others that are great too, like the scenes with Corran Horn in Lusankya."
4,A Slacker.,"This book does capture what Stackpole is aiming at, but failes to grasp this nail-biting tension of the others. The X-wing battle scenes are what make this book stand out. However, this book has almost none. The best part was the sudden apperance of the Lusankya (a SSD). I'll admit it, The O.J. trial was like sleeping tonic to me. That is about what the trial of Tycho is. Okay, but not the best"
5,really good,This book really show's what it takes be a rouge. Not only do you have to be one of the best fighter pilots in the galaxy you also have to be a cunning warrior as Corran Horn showed during his escape from the super star destroyer Luanske. Wedge also showed that he really has what it takes to be a leader. Also the fact Corran was the son of a Jedi was really neat.
3,Boring Until the End,"If you like to watch ""Peoples Court"" you may like this book. There is plenty of legal mumbo jumbo as Tycho's trial drags on and on. There is no action until the end, and then the ending is too unbelievable, even for a Star Wars novel. There is too much concentration on the political environment in Stackpoles books, and not enough action. Prepare to endure long secessions of meaningless character interactions."
3,The Krytos Trap,"Standard entry by Stackpole in the Rogue Squadron Series. Even allowing for Corran Horn's latent talent in the force, his escape from Lusankya seemd easier than it should have.Corran's discovery of his family's Jedi heritage seems like a set up for future adventures in the Corran Horn story line.The rest of the story seems mostly a set up for the next book, The Bacta War, which I am acually looking forward to, based on the first 2 books of the story."
5,a very good book,"The book is very entertaining. It gave us a view of the twisted personality of Iceheart. The part that I liked best, was the part where he used his grandfather's lightsaber to escape from Lusyanka."
3,Looking for some fiction - Submarines are always interesting,"This is the story of the crew of the submarine USS Nebraska on a three month deployment. What is nice is that the author pulls stories from the whole crew, not just the decision makers. He gives an insight to their past (what got them in the Navy), present (how they handle being under water so long), and future (what the sailor wants to do as a future career). The story really makes you think about: are nuclear deterrents still relevant in a post cold war world? Obviously some people think so. As you read this you also have to wonder, could I handle that much isolation?"
2,Don't bother with this one!,"I HATE this litter box! It is truly one of the worst and most aggravating ones I've bought. The lid does not click on the pan well enough to prevent pee leakage. The cats go up the steps, squat and then a stream of pee comes directly out the side where the lid and the pan meet - even with the lid firmly clicked in place (believe me I check and check again). I even resorted to using duct tape to make absolutely sure the thing wasn't coming part. Result? Soaking wet duct tape AND crystallized pee in the seam of the lid: yuck. And it doesn't help enough with the tracking problem: we still have a large area around the box with little grains of litter."
2,jerusalem scrolls,"THE STORY WAS EXCEPTIONAL"" THE BOOK ITSELF, I WILL NOT GIVE TO ANYONE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD UNDERLINED AND WRITTEN SYMBOLS IN THE BOOK. THIS WAS VERY DISTRACTING TO THE READER. IF IT HAD BEEN A COLLAGE TEXTBOOK, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT STORY.AS A PLEASURE BOOK, IT WAS NOT."
3,Good Buy But Some Problems,"I purchased the toughskin about 3 months ago and it helped keep my ipod in basically A+ shape. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is even though it is durable, not everything on it is built to last. The belt clip is cheaply made and through wear and tear eventually begins to crack. Also you may wanna buy something to protect the toughskin protective screen because eventually it gets very scratched and begins to faze the look of the picture. Another problem which is kind of minor is the 30 gb piece insertion leaves a mark after long term use. Overall for whats on the market today this is still the best buy to keep ur ipod for lasting them horrible falls and bumps."
4,"Starts to show it's age, so clean it...","I have had this for a few years now and the clear skin gets a bit dirty after a while. A good scrub with a dish sponge brings it back. It is also a bit bulky, but it protects your ipod from bumps and bruises. It took a 5 ft fall on cement without a problem."
1,Yellowed and saggy after a few months.,"Looked great out of the box, but after a few months, I've just had to dump it. The screen cover was sliding all over the place, letting all sorts of grime in and resulting in scratches. The plastic used to be clear but turned a nasty icky yellow on the corners - it's not just dirty, as I've washed it thoroughly; it's the plastic itself that changed colors."
5,I LOVE THIS CAMERA BAG!!,"This is a great little camera bag at any price, but particularly at $6.99. It's a nice fit for my Kodak EasyShare digital camera, which came with a pouch that didn't fit it at all. The Case Logic bag has a belt loop in addition to the shoulder strap, and it has a nice little front pocket with a mesh panel that's great for holding chapstick, a credit card, and some cash (or a spare battery and memory card). Well built, attractive, and compact."
4,Nice bag for the money,"Bag was received very quickly. Nice compact size, durable, just what I needed."
4,good size. durable exterior,"I bought this for my Canon SD500 and it holds the battery charger, 1 spare battery, and flash card reader. It's great for traveling."
5,Yummy...,If you like couscous thats one of the best brands around. high quality grains. the containers fit nice on my cabinets and the mouth are wide so you can scoop up as much you need.
4,New to couscous,"Until recently, haven't eaten couscous. Great surprise...I like it. Tried this sampler pack. Good introduction at a reasonable price. Texture of the cooked couscous by this brand is not as firm as I like but ok."
5,Very good product,"It is a great product, tastes great, my favorites are tri-color and tomato cous cous. I have nothing bad to say about the product."
3,"Lucent, insightful, but a bit academic.","Mr. Shippey has authored a volume of great interest to all Tolkien readers and fans. He elegantly accounts for various aspects of Tolkien's writing, including his image of evil, mythology, and how Tolkien used his encyclopedic knowledge of philology & old english texts to compose 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings'. In addition there are interesting comments relating to how Tolkien's works were initially rejected by the literary community. The only small minus is that the level ofacademic detail is occasionally perhaps too deep for the book to be of general interest.It is however curious how 'The Lord of the Rings' seems to escape analysis. Even after reading Mr. Shippey's very good book, it still seems to me a miracle that such a gigantic and brilliant work of fantasy could ever be written."
5,Philologist Roadmap,"This is an excellent book for anyone who wants an in-depth view of Tolkien. Most people today aren't philologists, so a lot of the depth of Tolkien's work is lost to the average reader. Shippey does an awesome job taking a microscope to the text and showing the incredible intricacy of The Silmarillion, Hobbit, and LotR. He shows the reader which ancient works Tolkien used for his own subcreation, as well as the way that those 'real' worlds and words affected his. It's definitely a great book for anyone who's interested in learning more about Tolkien and how his work is an extension of his philology. It shows how masterful Tolkien was, and how sophisticated his work is. Shippey is an amazing philologist in his own right, and the analysis in this book shows his academic caliber."
5,The best book I've read on Tolkien!,"Tom Shippey is the first Tolkien critic that actually understands where Tolkien was coming from when he wrote his masterful works. His book goes in depth to explain where Tolkien got his names, ideas, and what it was he was really trying to accomplish. Lord of the Rings fans will love the info, and true Tolkien lovers will gain insight and depth to their understanding of this genius of a man. Tolkien is aptly called the ""author of the century"" for more than one reason. This is a great book!"
4,"For a Highlander: The Series fan, this is slightly familiar.","A good read and a good romance, although the story does bear some significant elements similar to the classic 100th episode of HIGHLANDER, ""Comes A Horseman."" Check out the parallels between Shayne's Nidaba and Nathan, and Methos and Cassandra."
5,Maggie Shanye does it again!,"I am a huge fan of Maggie Shayne's paranormal fiction, and Destiny is among her best. The book kept me rivited. The detail and description of life in the ancient time of Sumer is absolutely fascinating. Her characters are appealing and well drawn. No one writes romance like Maggie.Although Infinity is still probably my favorite book out the trilogy, Destiny is not far behind. It's definately a keeper and a re-reader! I can't wait for Puabi's story in the fall."
3,Not As Good As the First Two Books,"The first book, Eternity was great. The second book, Infinity was good. This book was OK. I thought it dealt too much with their past. I think the other books should be read to understand the heroine better."
2,Up the creek without a pump.,"The lotion itself is good but the pump broke on my 3rd use. What a pain in the butt it is to open the container and dip my hand in to get some out every time I need some. Then my hands are glopped up when trying to get the lid back on. I'm going to be frustrated for a long time with this because I have a lot of lotion left. The real fun will begin when I can't reach the bottom with my hand. The edges are nice and sharp on the top of the opened container. I look forward to ripping up my skin, damaging my hands and wrists while I try to soften my feet. Not a fair trade off."
4,Foot Miracle,"I was first introduced to this product in my podiatrist office. I liked it so much that I ordered it from amazon. This is the second time I have ordered the 32 oz.pump jar. Its great, it is not oily, but it lubricates those dry areas including elbows, hands and feet."
5,It Works,"I have tried many products over the yr's but THIS is the last foot cream I'll ever try again because IT WORKS, simple as that, period."
1,Cueshe? Or Should I Say Cliche'....,"This album is so disappointing. If you really wanted to listen to good music you should look for albums from bands like Sugarfree, Bamboo, The Dawn, Kitchie Nadal, Barbie Almalbis (Barbie's Cradle/HYP), Imago, The Radioactive Sago Project, Cynthia Alexander and Wolfgang.The band is a trying hard Creed/ The Calling sounding wannabe. yes, they have an advantage in posting or should I say selling the album Thru Amazon.com. But we are talking about quality... Cueshe doesnt have it. Two vocalists who doesnt have have any talent.A disgrace to the Filipino Rock community.Forget about this album buy The Dawn's ""Harapin"" instead."
4,I want to be...,"I am looking to start my own company. This book was a good start. However, if you are looking for HOW to organize, this is not the book for you."
3,Not as helpful as I had hoped.,"While this book is helpful, it fell short of my expectations. I found it lacking in a lot of areas. One thing I did like was the CD that came with it, so that you can access forms."
4,Good resource to get started,"I thought it interesting that a Professional Organizer didn't actually write this book, but instead, the author interviewed several different organizers thus giving you ideas and methods from a variety of sources. The book includes some good marketing ideas and a CD with sample business forms to use."
2,"Ok, not great...","The book has a lot of information, but I would prefer to have simpler everyday guidelines, instead of general comments about organization."
2,does not come with the CD,"I am happy with the book. However, the book stated that a CD with forms and worksheets would be included, and wasn't. I would go directly to thier web site to order and pay knowing it will all be there!"
1,Howard Hughes - A live,"Interesting video for the uninitiated, but otherwise not worse the money. Get a book about the life of HH, it will give you more insights than this relative superfical video. I bought it by accident, as I thought it is a book. :-("
5,MST3K at its best!,"Stumbled across this on Netflix, and bought it Amazon. Classic MST3K. One of the very best!And so politically INCORRECT! American kids are shown as cowboys, and every other ethnic group similarly depicted."
3,"Ok, some good songs but as often is the case it is a complation with some bad choices",Not great but I usually mix the music up and use the tunes I like so being it wasn't expensive not too awful.
5,a real winner,wonderful collection- good clear sound- you can't go wrong with this collection-can't wait for Vol. 2
4,Nice Christmas songs,"This cassette is 29 minutes and 52 seconds and has the regular Christmas songs on it. White Christmas sung by Bing Crosby, The Christmas Song by Nat King Cole, and Little Saint Nick perform by the Beach Boys; the only group on the cassette. I liked it and I think you will to."
5,great songs,Good oldies for Christmas joy; loved all the songs. took me back to my childhood which was awhile ago. with the purchase.
3,Fine background Music,This is a fine recording for background music. The selection of song was average but fit the season. Good buy with other selection.
3,A twisty tale,"Nicholas Paleologus and his deceased brothers and sisters are the descendents of the last emperor of Byzantium. Their eighty-four year old father Michael is still alive and lives in a large house called Tennor in Cornwall. When Elspeth Hartley, Mr Tantris's PA shows Nick the missing window of the Day of Judgement at the church of St Neot and hints at the fact that it may be immured somewhere in the structure of Tennor thus immensely increasing the value of the property, Nick and his brothers and sisters have only one thing in mind - to convince their father Michael to sell the house to Mr Tantris. But it will take much more than simply convincing their father..."
4,BlastMatch,"I tried this product and it does what it suppose to. Just make sure you got hard surface and the right kind of tinder. It comes with only one. But not bad for the price. Another toy you might need to use some day, or not."
2,"Greene still interesting, book a disappointment","Having read the first two volumes I eagerly awaited the third. It is a major disappointment for at least three reasons. The first is that Sherry seems to have merged his identity with that of Greene, making frequent references to himself (and name dropping in the process). He even includes a photo of himself on a donkey, making himself look a little ridiculous. Second, he is obsessed with Greene's sex life. While quite interesting, Greene's sexploits get a little tedious after a few hundred pages. Finally, Sherry takes up many pages with summaries and long quotes from Greene's books. I can read Greene's books for myself, thank you very much."
3,Extreme browser customization,"The book covers using the Internet Explorer Construction Kit (included on the CD) to build your own custom web browser. Mainly this involves putting a new 'skin' on the browser by using customized graphics, like sheet metal, or custom buttons. There is one chapter on securing the browser from visiting certain sites. If you have an interest in using the software on the CD to build custom web browsers for PC then this book is for you."
1,Disappointing,"This book was a disappointment. The artwork on the cover is enticing. Essentially the book is a series of anecdotes with few tips or advice of real substance. A much better book has been written by an Australian author called ""Charming up Profits"". I would have to say that the book was a piece of sef-promotional self-indulgence doubtless designed to support the author's speaking engagements. I had expected so much more."
5,Dealing With Breast Cancer,"As a newly diagnosed woman with breast cancer I found Katherine Russell Rich's book to be one I couldn't put down. The thoughts and emotions she decribed for herself mirrored what I have been thinking and feeling. I would recommend her book for anyone entering ""Cancerland""as she so aptly put it."
1,not a great read for survivors,"I found this book terribly depressing and agonizingly cynical. As a cancer survivor, I was truly disappointed to read Rich's assessment of her struggle. Cancer isn't easy, of course, but we hear enough awful accounts of the disease to not need a book describing the constant unhappiness of the self-indulgent journey of one who seems so focused on only seeing the difficulty. For anyone involved in a struggle with cancer, I recommend that you do not read this book. Read something uplifting rather than something that drags you down, because there are amazingly powerful success stories filled with hope and blossoming joy. A woman (especially one struggling with cancer) can be realistic while being strong yet positive, determined yet hopeful."
3,"Okay story, but not an inspiration!","I bought this book because it was touted to be humorous, wise, uplifting and insightful. I found it to be depressing, whiny, angry and self-serving."
4,Good Read,"This is a memoir of a cancer journey as experienced by the writer. There are a lot of parts in this book that are not sugar coated, but the tough parts are leavened by the author's retrospective insights and wit. It's a strong personal account of someone moving on in life while going through many stages of treatment, remission, more treatment, etc., etc. Sometimes I did have to put it down for a while just to absorb it. Good read on a tough subject, but eventually we all know someone who has had cancer and there is a lot to learn from this book."
5,Awesome!,Delivery was super fast!! Book was exactly in the condition described (used with minimal wear and tear to cover)! I'm very satisfied!!! Thank you!
5,new,bought this book new at a great low price compared to my school bookstore which would have charged 3x more! I received this book right away after placing the order.
2,No real new insight....,"While I am a fan of David Brin, and also find some of the chapters within this book interesting, none of the authors really brought any new insight to the work 1984 or to George Orwell as a literary figure. The idea was to avoid scholars of Orwell's works to get new and fresh responses. But by doing so they also ended up going over all the old ground that those scholars have gone over for decades. Funny enough, scholars of 1984 would have known about all the same-old, same old issues and topics and may have tried to find something new to write about.The chapters are on sex, law and politics. Yes, we've read and heard this all before. How about reading the old stuff and THEN trying to find a new angle? Sorry, but two stars is as much as this work is going to get."
3,Black is black,"I really didnt expect this poor perfomance from LOS BRAVOS, a marvelous spain rock group that conquered our hards in the 60-70. All their songs in spanish got the attention of young and not too young people and Black is Black was the only one in english that we accepted and rated 5 stars.But in this item,all songs are in English and maybe because of that I didn't like.Furthermore the rithm in Black is Black is completly different and very poor if you compare with the original.I wanted to buy their original songs in spanish, but the offer was too expensive.Any way I will continue remembering this wonderful music group."
1,No original,"There are three different versions of Black is Black on this cd, but none are the original and the best, don't waste your money on this one if you're looking for the original version, of course if you like the disco version its for you."
1,Will Damage the Back of Your iPod,"There is a clear plastic piece on the back of the case that is used with the belt clip. This plastic piece will rub against the metal of the back of your iPod and leave a scratched circle. It even left a faint circle of scratches after I put on a fairly tough decal from Decal Girl on the back of my iPodThe plastic circle even managed to rip the decal. This was after I tried to put a layer of clear scotch tape over the plastic piece to help with the scratching.Part of the clear plastic piece that I'm trying to describe can be seen in one of the user photos. The other side is a larger, flatter plastic circle that contacts directly with the iPod.I would not recommend this product for use with the belt clip."
3,"Nice, but overpriced","Nice to cushion my son's ipod, but ridiculous price for the bit of plastic it is. No circle shield/dial protector like we had hoped for--my husband's toughskin has that which is pretty nice. Overall, a bit over-priced and wished it came with said protector. I might buy this again."
4,Great iPod case,"This is one of the toughest iPod cases I've seen. I keep my iPod in the car (hooked up through a digital input into the stereo) in this compartment. I didn't want it being scratched up during car turns and whatnot, so I found this. ToughSkin is right. It looks cool, adds grip, and doesn't reduce the functionality. The only problem I had with it was putting the clear plastic screen cover on... I had to work at it for 10 minutes. That's why I am giving it a 4/5. But maybe that was my mistake... just couldn't figure out the right way to do it? But once it is on, it is on, and it does exactly what it's supposed to do. I would buy another if this one broke. (Maybe then, I'd have more luck with the screen protector)."
5,Excellent product,"I have used this product for more than a month and I am more than satisfied. The Ipod fits perfectly in this ThoughSkin, doesn't wobble or anything. All buttons and controls of the Ipod are reachable, and the Ipod is very well protected against falls, bumps and scratches."
2,Totally scratches the IPOD,"I have 2 kids that each have the 30G IPOD and got this case to protect it from getting scratched. WRONG choice!!! Each IPOD is terribly scratched from this product. We have discontinued using them and feel sad for wasting so much money on two of them. The screen protector moves around, dirt gets under the rubber and acts like sand on the IPOD, and it is so hard to get in and out of pocket it isn't worth the headache anymore.I gave it one star because if you do drop the IPOD you may have a chance at recovering it undamaged."
3,Nothing Special,"While this product is inexpensive and does protect the ipod, a leather case is more convienient. When I need to hook up an FM-transmitter to the ipod, I have to remove it from the case - which is a bit of work. It does provide easy access outside of the transmitter issue. The screen gard that fits within the rubber skin does not lineup real well but seems to hold in place."
4,great for the price,"This is a great product. It is rubber, not hard plastic as its photo may appear. It offers good padding for minor shocks, and the glass screen is removable. The glass screen is great to protect the ipod screen from scratches. The only downside is that cleaning this screen is quite cumbersome (doesn't come off easily, doesn't fit back in easily). But overall a must-have for all Ipod owners."
4,Good for the price...,"Very good product that keeps your iPod safe, except thatit gets dirty quickly. Otherwise its fantastic."
3,Will Scratch the Back of Your iPod,"In general, I agree with the reviews for the product. The rubber case and screen protector are well-designed enough to protect the iPod, at least the front of it. The back of the iPod is a different story.If you have a 60GB or 80GB iPod, the back of the iPod is completely exposed to the belt clip, which will scratch your iPod. I got the case a couple of months ago, and have left my iPod in it since. When I finally took my iPod out of the case, I noticed a circular scratch deeply etched into the back. If you do get this case, I'd suggest placing a scratch protector or something on the back of the iPod."
5,great product at a great price,"They gave me a great product at a great price. I will definitely buy from them again, in the near future."
5,Great value Awesome Case,"Bought this for an 80GB Ipod Video, fits nice and snug. Very durable, nice grip, has a masculine look to it. ""Toughens"" up the Ipod. Is used on a construction site and have had NO problems with it. I highly recommend this case to anyone looking to protect their investment from scratches,dents and shocks."
3,OK but could be better accomodating to adaptors,Like the feel but the opening at the bottom was too small for my FM transmitter connector so I needed to cut away some of the material. Also the plastic cover that slides over the screen should be larger and fit better - you can easily lose this piece. I choose not to use it anyway.
4,iPod Video ToughSkin with Belt Clip Black,"Wonderful product. Performs every bit as promised. Very easy to use...No bothersome flaps to deal with. The protection for the screen is nice too. But could they not have made it look a bit more sleek..I mean, does it have to look as if it truly is made out of recycled aeroplane tires?!?!"
4,$29 and more flexible than it looks,It looks like this is tough hard stuff but actually it's wigglier and not as bulky. Get the invisible shield on it first before using the toughskin so you don't get any scratches on your ASSET.I use this all the time.
3,"great case, but needs to lose weight.","This case is great at protecting your ipod, in fact this probably has the best impact protection of any other ipod case that I've seen, however it's not without some negative aspects. First off, this case is a bit bulky, which is a problem for me when putting in or taking out of my pants pocket. I'm aware that the extra rubber is what makes it impact resistant, but it also adds some inconvenience. Secondly the case leaves scuff marks on your ipod during removal or insertion, this isn't that big a deal...as it's not permanent, but may be more of a problem if you plan on taking your ipod out of the case frequently. Overall, the case does a great job at keeping your ipod safe, but it's just a tad bit bulky for my taste."
4,It needs,"Something like this is need to protect the thin shelled Ipod and this does a really good job. since I use the Ipod to provide music and my darkroom and have the Apple speaker, something else is needed. The Ipod's base sits into the speaker unit and must be removed from the ToughSkin in order to use the speaker. It's dificult to get it in and out of the case but having destroyed one unprotected Ipod, I place put it back into it's case."
2,Hard to get on,"This thing is tuff, but you have to have to struggle to get it on, since it is made of rubber. It is make pretty cheap as well. No way it is worth $30. And it is even harder to get it off. If you have some sort of base station or charger (I have a pair of Logitech mm50 speakers), you cant plug it in with the skin on, you have to take it off. Only buy this if you plan on never hooking it up to a pair of speakers. Mine just sits on my desk, since I dont want to take it off and put it on every time I want to plug it into my speakers. Buy a thinner skin, this one is way too thick."
4,Capuchin,"This is great. It protects my iPod really well.The only problem is that I can't connect my iPod directly to speakers when the skin is on; I have to use a cable, which doesn't charge the iPod. I wish there was a connecter/extender to put between the iPod and speakers. I've searched the web and the only thing I could find is still being developed and planned to sell at close to 100.00.But, for a protective skin, I like this the best."
2,"It works wel, but service didn't help","I really like the product, but wh I ordered it they told me that it would come with a $20 rebate, as of yet I haven't got it. The product is good, butte service was less than desireable."
4,buy this instead of the stackable filters,"This filter is a direct replacement for the large HEPA filter for the Sears and Honeywell air cleaners. Beware, the alternative that is being sold is a stackable filter, but you need to buy FOUR of them, which totals a lot more than the cost of this filter."
3,"With 3 Stars being average, this book rates 3 stars.","This is a good book that covers the topics well. Much of the information on counters and their impact actually comes from the Help Index, without additional comments or added value. Too bad, because the synergy and impact of multiple counters on performance is one area that really could use more thorough coverage.The added value that an outstanding performance tuning guide would provide is missing from most of the Windows 2000 performance tuning guides that have been published. The best current resources at this point continue to be experience and digging through the Microsoft Technet whitepapers.If you need a handy shelf reference, this one's as good as the other ones out there, though I believe the Microsoft Windows 2000 Performance Tuning and Technical Reference is slightly better for both begining and experienced performance tuners."
1,Poorly Written and Factually Inaccurate,"Very Disappointing. Not only is this book extremely poorly written and difficult to follow, the technical information presented is of little value and mostly invalid. The author starts with false assumptions, continues through flawed logic and erroneous (and usually irrelevant) calculations - to arrive at dubious results. I was optimistic when I bought this one, as it proclaims to be written by ""one of the world's leading Windows 2000 benchmarking and performance experts"", but this book has led me to seriously doubt the qualifications of the bestower of the title. Pass this one by."
2,8 Great throws......,"8 great throws, then the handle snapped off when it hit a spruce tree... No warranty because it was used. It very well could have been defective, but I would never it buy again."
2,Like watching paint dry,"You know a book is bad when the instructor admits it's boring. The knowledge is good, but this is an academic military history book with no sense of prose or style that would make the reader want to continue reading. Instead, this book made me want to sleep. It's almost tragic that a topic as fascinating as military tactics and battles could be made so boring. Where's Max Boot or Victor Davis Hansen when you need them???If you need a cure for insomnia, then I give this book 5 stars."
5,This Classic Is A Fundamental Must Read for American Military Historians,"You may not agree with everything Prof. Weigley argues for in this book, but he undoubtedly produced a great scholarly work that forces subsequent historians to take his thesis into consideration when discussing the history of American armed forces. Even if you do not agree with his central argument, his book is worth the read just for the narrative of American military history. Highest recommendation."
4,Good overall.,Very good information although perhaps dated in a few areas. Served my purpose as a good resource for a thesis.
2,"Good topics, but hard to read","I had to purchase this book as part of a class for a military course. I thought the book would be interesting considering the fact that my undergrad degree was in history, but I was disappointed. This book is a difficult read and I often find myself re-reading parts of assignments because I can't stay engaged."
3,"Not Definitive, and Flawed","Russell Weigley is a good historian when it comes to such topics as the organizational history of a military organization, such as his excellent History of the United States Army.This book is somewhat pedantic, a little too boring, and written by an historian who doesn't appear to understand soldiers or soldiering. When writing of how a country has waged war, and how it may continue to do so, this is a must, and it hasn't been demonstrated here.There is value here, though, and it should be read by all and sundry. For a better understanding of the American soldier, and how and why he fights, perhaps a better choice is American Army Life by John Elting.In my opinion, as both a soldier and an historian, is that Professor Weigley was a little out of his depth here, and attempted to categorize how American armies and their generals choose to fight their wars. It isn't as simple, nor as complicated as the author attempts to demonstrate."
4,Funny yet good,"Ok so we did this workout video in PE one day, and I thought it was SUPER strange. First of all the guy is half naked in the middle of the desert, and then you got these wierd movements that he does, and then this wierd sounding narrator that says 'exhale' like he's retarded.But here's how the video goes:In the VERY beginning of the video you just kinda lay there watching 500 precautions go across the screen. Then after listening to people say all these wierd yoga words for 10 minutes, the workout begins.In the beginning you just kinda sit there and the half-naked yoga guy says all this wierd stuff that relaxes you.Then you move onto the actual workout portion, which isnt long, like 10-15 minutes. The workout part was actually pretty good for toning my abs.After that you lay on the ground for 3 minutes positioned as if you fell off a building.Overall I would suggest buying this video, because its short, and perfect for a busy schedule."
1,in good shape? don't bother.,"I really enjoy yoga and am in quite good shape and I was extremely disappointed in this video. It had no effect on my abs. I felt no burn. I could have done this while asleep. Bottom line: if you can see your feet, don't bother with this tape."
3,Yoga for Abs,"This tape is OK. If you have ever done any other abs video (e.g., Tammi Lee Webb, Denise Austin), and you're in pretty good shape, you will hardly be challenged. I don't know if this tape works because I've only used it once. But I do know that my abs do not feel worked this morning. If you want yoga and relaxation, this tape is pretty good. If you want a hard workout for your abs, get another tape."
2,It Doesn't Work!?!?!?,"The voice in the video is very queer. It doesn't present the tranquility I was looking for. In addition, the moves don't really help if you want a nice ab, even running or situps shows better result than that. Plus, the quality of the video tape is BAD, 'snow-flakes' were everywhere!!! I must confess I'm disappointed:("
3,Beware of this video,"While I enjoyed the workout, I was very disappointed in the instructional value of this video - particularly since it is marketed to beginners. The moves he demonstrates are VERY hazardous for those with lower back issues, and not only doesn't he show modifications, he doesn't even caution you to be careful. I probably will not purchase any other Rodney Ye tapes - there are other instructors out there with much better products."
5,I hate to exercise!!!!,"I hate to exercise and get bored easily, so I was looking for something ""different"" when I bought this tape. For the first time ever, I can actually say I enjoy and look forward to doing this tape every day. The first time I did it, I didn't think I was getting much of a workout...until the next morning! Now I'm hooked!"
3,30 minutes of tape -7 minutes of yoga,"You will not do any yoga until about 12 minutes of advertising and warnings have been displayed plus the obligatory yoga mood adjustment scenes for a couple more minutes. Between minutes 18 and 22 Rodney does some serious ab work but thats about it. All those promos that say ""good for the beginner and something for the more advanced"" are standard marketing hype. Its just not worth the cost."
1,Not Enough!,"I expected more from this video based on the reviews. I, who am not in particularly good shape, did not find it challenging. Worse yet, it was WAY TOO SHORT! I expect at least a 25-30 minutes of yoga and workout. What I got was nothing but promotion. BORING! I will donate this one to the library"
4,Great video workout,"Rodney Yee is a wonderful, gentle yoga teacher who inspires students with his fluid, easy workouts. This is a perfect video for someone who is just starting out. While nothing beats doing 1,000 crunches a day, this video will help to strengthen and tone the abdominals in a smooth, gentle way. Yes, you'll feel the burn but not so much so that you'll become discouraged. This video can be done everyday. it's only about 15 minutes long so don't expect to be drenched in sweat. The video is shot beautifully and you'll feel rejevunated!"
3,Living Hell Yoga,"If you are 20 pounds overweight, forget this Yoga project. You may wind up in the emergency room of your local hospital. It is beautiful to look at, but by no means is it for beginners.This video is for those with somewhat toned bodies and under 50. The asanas are difficult to execute if you have flabby abs, heavy thighs and shallow breathing. I know that I'm being hard on Rodney Yee for his proposition that anyone can do these poses. The man is a master at what he does. So for what it's worth, enjoy the scenery and go at your own risk with the poses.So lose some weight and then pick up this video because it is not the road to quick ab building."
2,What a joke!,"I agree with the others who gave this video a bad review. It was too short and didn't work the abs. There is also the issue of ""back safety"".I'll stick to crunches. They're safe and effective.On the positive, the scenery was beautiful."
4,A good start,"This tape will relax & challenge you at the same time. It is a very good ab workout, not strenuous but the slow controlled movements will speak for themselves. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
2,Was not pleased,"I bought this tape with hopes of it being easy to follow and for beginners. it's easy to follow as far as pace, however the instructor (Rodney Yee) does not explain how to get into the positions very well. The scenery is very beautiful and that was the only thing that kept me watching. I watched it once and haven't since."
3,"Not really for beginners, especially ones with bad backs!","I bought this tape because I'd heard really good things about Rodney Yee and I was looking for ways to strengthen my abs. I think there should have been more warnings that some of the moves would stress the back (they did mine!) One move had you kind of rocking on your spine, and for someone who had back surgery, this is NOT something I wanted to do. I did start the move, but my back was not agreeable to this! I bought a couple of other beginners tapes which I hope will eventually allow me to try this one again in the future."
4,"First yoga video I have ever bought, it will not be the last","I have never done yoga before, until I tried this tape. At first I thought that this is way to easy...how can this work? Well it does! I do this tape everyday after my cardio tapes and I love it. After my first workout, my abs felt tighter. I have been doing this now for about two weeks and I can not only feel, but now I am beginning to see the difference.Buy this tape you will not regret it. It is a great way to round off your workout, or just to do when you are crunched for time!"
1,Riddled with errors,"I have never seen a non-fiction book filled with so many errors! It says that Joan Fontaine won an Academy Award for To Have and Have Not. Audrey Hepburn is not included on the list of actresses who won Oscars for first films or first leading roles. It lists all three African-American actors who won for Best Supporting Actor, but on the very next page declares that only two actors, Denzel Washington and Cuba Gooding, Jr., won, suddenly forgetting about Lou Gossett. Marie Dressler died in 1934, not 1933. It goes on and on. This book could have been a wonderful reference, but with all these mistakes it's undependable."
3,This book published long time ago,I got this book for my International Intellectual Property Law class. It is really old book. So lots of things changed since. You should check information's. I did not like this book that old. Somehow it is considered as a reputable source. If you don't have to buy it don't buy it just borrow it from library.
2,IP Law Professors - Avoid this book!!!,"Although this book purports to be about international intellectual property, it approaches the subject with such a leaning toward the US system that I feel as if I'm re-taking an intro to US IP. This book is bad. The cases, while illustrative, are nearly all US cases. Consider other alternatives when selecting a book for your class - perhaps a book that understands the word ""international"" means something more than US law."
1,Robbery,"Dont waste your money on any of these posters, they are simply regular printouts that you can do yourself at home!!"
3,The better of the two Merle Christmas CDs,"This CD gets released over and over with different names and the songs in different orders. I consider it a must because it's got the best version of ""Silver Bells"". I collect Christmas CDs and make Christmas CDs for family, and so I've got a dozen versions and Merle's version has the best pacing and arrangement, a classic. (The other Merle holiday CD available through Amazon does not contain ""Silver Bells"".) Then, of course, it's got the other classic ""If We Make It Through December""."
1,OUT OF DATE,"NJ Civil service change its testing format, i believe back in 1998 0r 1999. It is now similar to NYPDs test. The other way to get hired in NJ is through the NJ Chiefs Association test, which is covered briefl in the book."
5,Ya Gotta -- Ya Gotta,"If you are a fan of Rosemary Clooney -- this is a ""must have"".If you only know her from the 50's -- this is a ""must have"".The lively, young, exuberant Rosemary Clooney of the early years never left. After a sad passage in her career, Rosie came back as strong as ever -- but there was a deeper understanding of the lyrics that she chose to sing. This album shows without a doubt the effect that singing before live audience can have on a person of great talent. This is Rosie at her best. At 74 years of age this lovely lady is still communicating with her audience. This is the ""basic"" Rosie at her best. This is the only ""live"" concert recording of the Clooney voice. And it is a necessary addition to any ""pop"" collection. We lost her far to soon."
3,a decent book with good cgi info for programmers,"this is perhaps one of the less clear o'reilly's books. the author makes a good effort on a (sometimes) tricky subject, but his explanations are not always satisfactory.to compound the issue, the author's coding style is a little annoying. embedding unusually long fragments into decisions, unneccessary string appending (vs variable interpolation), etc.. this leads to a more formidable 'look' to his code examples.there is a lot of good information to be gained from the book, though. for programmers who haven't learned cgi yet, i would suggest this title. for those with little or no coding experience, this book is probably not for you."
2,Too much filler,"I'm a fan of O'Reilly books and I bought this one on the strenght of the brand name. Unfortunately, it just doesn't live up to other O'Reilly titles. This is probably as much a function O'Reilly's high expectations as anything. This book contains way too much filler and source code listings. Also, a lot of the content is simply reprints of FAQs. I can't really compare this book to other CGI books, but I definitely do not recommend this book to anyone that is already familiar with CGI and Perl."
2,Disappointing,"In recent years, O'Reilly have really distinguished themselves in their ability to select top-notch authors, offering clear and accurate books that carefully balance the tutorial and reference aspects of technical writing.Unfortunately, they missed the mark on this one. The author made a valiant effort, but the subject matter simply isn't sufficient to fill the book. The result is a lot of padding interspersed with very sparse information content. The verbosity handicaps the book as a tutorial, and completely ruins it as a reference. The information content is sufficient for a book of perhaps a third the length.The best thing I can say about this book is that it may be the ""least bad"" choice - a sad reflection on the state of CGI literature. There's so much of it, and it is all so BAD. The subject matter lends itsself better to a concise summary form - perhaps as an appendix to a book of broader scope. Perhaps a good CGI reference already exists, but I have yet to see it."
5,Great book...,"I'm a new perl programmer and I thought this book was very useful. Example could have been more together and then explain it in detail. If you can get this book, get it. Its great!"
2,"Too many pages, too little information","This book starts out explaining each section and in the process of doing so keeps losing focus on what it is really trying to explain and many times doesn't end up explaining it. Also, there is way too much information crammed in there that really has no value. The burden is on the reader to identify and disregard it. The only reason I bought this book, is because it had the O'Reilly name on it. Next time I will be careful about buying O'Reilly books."
2,Lots of fluff,"Not easy to understand. Sometimes it is difficult to follow what the author means. There is too much detail, which I feel was getting in the way of understanding CGI.I was initlally exicited , but after reading the first few chapters, i think i will have to look elsewhere."
1,Lightweight at best,"This book is a waste. It has about 2 chapters of any real value. I'd recommend O'Reilly's excellent ""Learning Perl"" by Schwartz and Christiansen. It has as much useful information in its CGI chapters as the entire ""CGI..."" book. And you really have to know Perl anyway to understand the ""CGI..."" book. So start there and see what happens."
1,A total waste of my time and money.,No wonder it is out of print. I bought it based on the O'Reilly name. But this book told me everything has to be taken with a grain of salt.
3,"Not bad, except for the examples","The book is a good overall intro to CGI and Perl. The examples, however, are not very accurate. Most of the examples leave out the semi-colons which cause errors, but other than that, its not a bad book."
1,Don't even waste your time. Very disappointing.,"If you are a beginner with programming, this is definitely not for you. Get the Learning Perl book to understand Perl first, then come back to this book and understand CGI. The examples are boring. The explanations are dry. A nice remedy for insomnia."
2,nice tv but....,"dont break the remote. if you do you wont ever be able to use your dvd player or anything else with it. in order to watch dvd's or anything you have to get onto the video1 or video2 channel. you can only do this with the input button on the remote. ive bought multiple universal remotes and none of them worked. emerson has discontinued this model and they no longer stock this model's remote. they will send you to 1800-remotes. you will be quoted a price of about $35 plus tax and shipping. my price for TN came to roughly $42. so if you have kids that like to break remotes, a pet that chews on them, or youre prone to random fits of rage and like to take it out on your remotes then id suggest you steer clear of this tv."
1,Pass this one up,"I will break this review up into 3 parts for ease:1.) Regular TV viewing: Maybe the best aspect of the TV, colors all look decent for the most part, decent clarity as well...overall 3/52.) DVD's/movies: Same as television, I also noted somtimes that really deep reds and greens have a strange flicker and it makes the picture look unpleasant. 3/53.) Video games: Worst part of TV. These annoying black borders cut off significant parts of the image (health bar/points) and when displaying more of the vivrant colors they flicker. 1.5/5I am a bit of a audio/visualphile so I may be a little harsh, but I am very dissapointed with this TV on the whole. OK for regular TV viewing, but if you are a bit of a ""tech-dude/chick"" steer clear of this machine."
1,They sent me the wrong picks,I ordered those picks together with the .50 size picks.I got the .50 size picks in a thin size packs and I got another .50 picks in a thin/medium size pack.
5,Very Helpful,My husband died in November 1999. A few weeks after his death I went to a book store searching for a book that might help me with my intense grief. I found this little book and as I read it I couldn't believe how each day's reading seemed to be just what I needed that day. Ms. Stern's words seemed to touch me personally each time I picked it up. I have bought several copies for gifts as friends have lost their husbands and I recommend this book to any grieving widow.
5,In business? Know anyone in direct sales?,The stark reality is haunting. I have arelative who fits poor Willy's description.Business can be disasterous on those who don'tsucceed. It is really a tragedy that Irecommend to fully pity the loser's point of view.
4,Mrs. Larson weaves an intriquing WW2 romance.,"DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT is a rare ethnic romance between an Asianhero and Caucasian heroine. For this I applaud Mrs. Larsen and ThomasNelson Publishers. The story is a unique romance showing how love can prevail over prejudice and bigotry. It is nice to see someone writing the stories I would like to read as well as giving me the hope of a market for my personal Japanese romances. Thank you, Mrs. Larson, I enjoyed reading your novel."
5,I thought it was wonderful.,"This is a lovely story about good people in a horrible situation. Jean is very real, she grows slowly into a kind, mature woman. Tom is incredible. The book has a very deep message about prejudice and responsibility for your own actions.I enjoyed this book very much. I found it by accident at an outlet mall on a discount counter. The book was so good I came on line as soon as I finished it to find the next one in the series. I can't wait to find out why life has in store for Tom and Jean! I hope the next book will be available soon."
4,A surprising treasure,"I am so saddened to see that this book is out of print because I think it is exciting to see someone telling a story through verse. Yes, I know this is not unique. I have read a few other memoirs and ""novels"" that were written in verse rather than prose. Which is why I don't always feel that the choice is effective. After reading this book, I wanted to find more works by Kim Addonizio.I pray that this book finds its way back in print because without it the literary world has lost a lovely light."
4,A must have for any Win32 Programmer's Collection,"My only criticism of this book is the title ""Win32 Programming"" which encompasses far more than just GUI programming. This book does not cover many important sections of the Win32 API (no single book can), it focuses primarily on GUI programming.If you are writing Win32 applications with a GUI interface, this book is a must. No other book is as comprehensive and I found the text as well as the code easy to follow (and I'm not a C/C++ programmer)."
5,The single best reference to beginning Windows Programming,"This book is KEY. By that I mean that regardless if you choose to use MFC or not (and I do a lot of stuff that does not, being a graphics person) this book offers insight into programming, the mess that is Win32, and how to deal with it. If offers help regarding the various versions of Windows and the associated history and language conventions, the most correct and incorrect ways to deal with typing issues that some compilers would let you get around but would hamstring you later in porting your code, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, it is readable. It isnt very often you get a programming book you can take somewhere and read it, comprehend it, come back to the compiler and run the sample code later and still retain comprehension. You can do that with this book. Code is good, the explorer progs are better, but the text is first rate. I would buy this and Petzold, and your choice of MFC book, and you should be well on your way."
5,This book is well worth every penny!,"This is a great book to own! I continuously refer to it, and occasionally sit down with it to learn new topics. It also gives a great description of how owner-draw items work (menus, etc.) and their differences between straight-Win32 and MFC. Great coverage on bitmaps and how to use the device context for drawing, with excellent straight-forward examples!"
1,"oops..NO CD-ROM!!! , oops again..NOT HARDCOVER!!!","This is a GREAT book! Unfortunately, it NO LONGER comes with a CD-ROM!!!So if YOU have the time to MANUALLY key in over 140,000 lines of code, then you SHOULD buy this book....assuming that you could make NO ERRORS!!!!???As a minor point, it also comes as two(2) paperback volumes.This is not a problem for me...I like paperback, BUT it is one more point where this product is being MISREPRESENTED."
2,Not for beginners,"If your looking for a book to get you started programming windows, then dont buy this book.Its not a ""How To Book"", it a reference book.A waste of money if your a beginner."
1,"To be honest, the book is useless, and here is why :","Because it contains so huge examples, that it's impossible to follow the code.With almost every example, you can find a sentence like this :""Don't worry about what does it mean"", or ""You really don't have to know that"".I think, you got the picture.Although, there are over 1500 pages, explanations are very bad, and incomplete.The book is probably usefull to highly experienced win programmers, but againDo they need a book about creating windows ? I guess not.If you are new to windows programming, you won't learn anything from it.In the matther-of-fact,you could give up after a while (while = few months), like I did."
1,can't open the door,"I bought two books at same time:One is Petzold's book(the best one),the other is this book(bad one). Petzold's book explain very well how to compile the code.It also has very good example.But in this book, I don't know how to compile the example.I tried to see Make file because I already have experience with make file in Petzold's book.But I was surprised at the size of make file in CD-ROM. I also tried to read some page about VC++ envirnment in this book,still nothing.Again I load the examples in VC++ envirnment and tried to compile using VC++ envirnment,but it failed.I think that the author assume the reader know how to compile his example. That is not true.Even if your room has diamond,if you can't open your door,it is nothing.Maybe this book has good example.But I can't open the door. How can I compile codes after I changed them???"
2,Does not live up to Dummies expectations,"This is easily the worst Dummies book I have ever purchased. It is only for the most novice user who has no experience in other email or PIM programs. It is too elementary, coverage is too skimpy and the poor index makes it nearly worthless as a reference book. A good example of this book's failings is its lack of discussion on how to create an internet type signature for your email messages. The authors spend far too much time trying to be cute with humor, effort which would have been better spent making a decent reference. Pass this one by."
3,A severely flawed look at pieces of the craft.,"To the writer: For whom was this book written? Who was the intended audience? What's with the ""thesaurus"" words peppering the text? Why all the conjecture? Why not just ask the composer? This is a treatise I'd hand back to the student for major rewriting."
5,A Wanted Man,"Brianna McGraw is one impressive heroine. Strong. Courageous. Invincible--except when it comes to Trey Morgan. This tough, tender story set in the Old West is pure pleasure to read. Nancy Parra gives us an old fashioned tale of endurance, committment, incredible sacrifice and love. Pick up a copy of A WANTED MAN, and spend a few hours in the rugged West with Brianna and Trey. You'll be glad you met them and joined them on their journey."
5,A Wonderful Story,"This is a beautifully written western love story. Brianna is intelligent, tough and compassionate. The depiction of this woman, a recent transplant in the west from Boston, setting out to capture a wanted man for the bounty is absolutely believable. Trey Morgan, the ""criminal"" in question is a perfectly delightful hero. He tempers his own strength because he is so fascinated to see what his petite little captor will do next."
2,product is great - price is rediculous,"I love this product. I have two of them, one that had worn to a point it can't be used any more. I wanted to replace it and thus this order. I couldn't believe the price. For a piece of foam with hook & loop it's crazy expensive. I bought it any way but am giving it two stars because of the price."
5,"wonderful, endearing full of useful info and inspiring","a great book, my children enjoyed it, I enjoyed it, offers the fairy tale magic and the wholesome herbal knowledge - lovely illustration too"
1,The Herbalist of Yarrow,"As a clinical herbalist myself, I am excited to find a book that both honors my avoction and the old religion. This book was first introduced to me at Herb school and I longed for a copy to gift my grandchildren with. I now have a grandson and I am ordering a copy for myself as well. I teach herbal day camp and this will be a loving addition to my teaching. the story is instructional as well as fun for adults and children alike. The plants also are ecstatic with the book, (I read it to them!) I highly recommend this to all earth loving plant loving peoples"
3,Good outline,"I read this book for a class on American History during the 1960s and it gives a very good outline of the Chicano Movement of the time. For someone who knew nothing about the subject before picking up ""Chicanismo"" it was very eye-opening. Garcia is extremely knowledgeable about the topics he speaks to and I found this book to be a very good exploration of the causes, effects, and components of the Chicano Movement in the United States."
3,Old Wayne not Classic Young Wayne,Growing up my family owned two different Wayne Newton LP albums. One was Wayne's very first album titled Merry Christmas to You and the Second was Merry Christmas from Wayne Newton. I have been looking for alternatives to the costly process of searching out mint condition LPs and having them ripped to CD or MP3.THIS ALBUM IS NOT IT. This album is Older More Swing style Wayne when I am looking for Young crooner style Wayne from the 60's. If you like Wayne's style as he is now this is the album for you. If not keep looking.
3,"Merry Christmas, a prosperous New Year and God bless.","This was Wayne Newton's second Christmas album. It was originally released in 1979. It features mostly older Christmas songs plus a few originals. The older ones are mostly nothing special, although he does do an exceptional version of ""Silver Bells"". Another notable ""oldie"" is ""Jingle Bell Hustle"", which is a disco version of ""Jingle Bells"". This incredibly dated track was actually released as a single, and not surprisingly wasn't a hit. As for the original songs, they are a mixed bag. ""It's the Season"" is very good and ""It Could Have Been a Wonderful Christmas"" is above average, but the rest of them aren't that memorable. This is a definite ""middle of the road"" Christmas album."
3,A must for Christmas music fans,"I am Wayne Newton fan and a collector of Christmas music so when I saw this CD I knew it had a place in my collection. I wouldn't say that any of the songs will become immortal classics but there are some ""b-grade"" classics which will become favourites for those who don't take their Christmas music too seriously - particularly ""Jingle Bell Hustle"" (yes, it's exactly what the name suggests). This is a decent album of enjoyable Christmas music."
3,Just fine but not a miracle produce,"My son just doesn't seem to be able to hold a pacifier in his mouth on his own, and these were no different. He seems to like them okay but I was really hoping he'd be able to keep these in his mouth on his own, like other people seem to have experienced."
4,Very Pretty,This dress is well made and very pretty. I do think all of the dresses offered for the American Girl dolls are over-priced.
5,Fabulous!,This is really sweet. Much nicer in life than in the picture and the picture is pretty good! The slippers that come with it are just to die for!
5,Beautiful,Beautiful dress and shoes. Very well crafted. Bought this for my niece because she just got her first American Girl doll. Fits the doll perfectly and much better price than what the cloths on the American Girl doll site cost.
3,Good Job!!,"This dress rox!! The only downers are that the bow in the front is not attached to the dress exept for in the middle. this means that i could- and i did because i didn't like the look of the bow in the front- take the bow off if i wanted to and that the shoes dont stay on very well at all. Otherwise it is a two thumbs up:] (oh, and i didnt think it had much educational value because there is no time period base)"
5,Beautiful!,"Very pretty and well made. Picture looks great; but, it is much prettier than the picture. Lovely dress! Great quality and color."
3,disappointed in Lockwood,"I LOVED her first book, ""I Do, but I Don't"" so I couldn't wait to read her 2nd novel. It was a cute story but definately did not have the same charm and sarcasm as her first."
5,WHEEEEE!!!!,"This was such a great read! So enjoyable...I almost didn't want it to end..it was hilarious and what was even more funny, was I could relate to the main character in alot of bumbling ways!"
3,Cute read!,"I have to admit, I did not enjoy this book as much as Lockwood's ""I Do, But I Don't"". Part of it had to do with Jane, the main character. About halfway through the book, I began to wonder if she was ever going to straighten up and fix her life. How can someone go from having a job to doing nothing day after day and not want to change? But in finishing the book, I had my answers. Sometimes when things get so bad, the only way out is to continue down!The romantic storyline is somewhat predictible which I found disappointing. Lockwood used some of her same tools from ""I Do But I Don't"" for the romance portion of the story. And that creates predictiblity.Overall, though, it's lite reading and fun."
2,Where was the Editor on This One?,"This was my first exposure to Cara Lockwood, and being a connoisseur of chick lit, I was looking forward to an exciting, smooth read. Talk about a lesson learned after judging this book by its cute cover. Normally a molasses-like plot irks me more than anything, but this time it was Lockwood's shoddy fact-checking that overshadowed her novel's dragging, mundane storyline. Case in point, who out there doesn't know that the awesome dad from the 80s Molly Ringwald movie is *not* from ""Sixteen Candles"", as stated by Lockwood, but is in fact from ""Pretty in Pink""? Exactly. Unforgivably glaring blunders like these, including others like the misspelling of actor Sean Astin's name (Lockwood calls him ""Sean Austin""), made me lose complete faith--and consequently interest--in this evidently hastily-pieced together, poorly edited tripe."
1,Horrible!,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Choppy and best and cheesy at worst, this book is filled with unoriginal plotlines, boring and undeveloped characters, 'crazy' adventures that just make me embarrassed for the author, and love stories that I can't care about.The romantic scenes read like a preteen wrote them, fantasizing herself as the heroine, and the author seems to expect you to care about characters that you know nothing about. I find the father especially irritating, as he seems to embody all of the author's personal prejudices. The heroine is spoiled and whiny, never acting anywhere near her age.Obviously this piece of drivel was written quickly, and with no thought to the actual story. You would be better off reading just about anything else."
1,Design flaw,"Great MJ Lenses. Unfortunately, arm broke off after a month of _very_ gentle use. Got them replaced and the second pair did the same thing."
1,IL Series of Re-recordings,"I have given this a low rating because what is important to me when purchasing music from the 50 & 60s is finding the original recordings by the original artists. This isn't it. To be fair, when it comes to The Crystals, that's difficult to do. Though these records are close, I want the originals. For some reason, these artist are just difficult to find in the original form. Though there were a number of items by the Crystals available (mostly imports), none boasted ""original records by the original artists"" But this CD cost less than any of the others, and I thought I'd give it a chance."
5,This is a great album.,"This is like the Sonny I remembered from earlier albums, like, ""Southern Gentleman"",""Sonny"", and ""Honey"" (the three albums I am trying to locate). Sonny's style and mellow voice is unique and makes for easy listening."
5,Great CD!,Cd is in great shape and made a great gift. No damage to case or CD and it arrived one day before Christmas!
3,Lacks common cultivated species of Southern California,The breadth of this guide is insufficient if you want to identify trees walking around the city of Los Angeles.
2,"A lot of information, didn't like format","I purchased several of these NAS field guides because they are very highly rated. Unfortunately, I was really dissappointed when I received them. They are way too small. At 4.2 by 7.8 inches they probably make good little guides to put in your backpack/purse but the way they are laid out seemed really odd to me for a field guide. I like to have the pictures on the same page as the information about the tree/flower/animal etc. These little books have the pictures in a separate place from the rest of the information so you have to go back and forth all the time. And with the small size, this is really inconvenient to do. It's just a personal preference I guess but I may have looked at the books once or twice since I bought them and now they sit to collect dust."
5,field guide,THis is a Cmas present for myself from my stepdaughter. She didn't know what to get me and I recommended this book since we may move to Denver.
5,Nice guide for at home or the field.,This book offers excellent photographs and very extensive information on trees. I use it often and have had great success identifying trees that otherwise I wouldn't know what they were. nicely organized and easy to use. The compact size is awesome for travelling and taking it hiking. Another great Audobon guide.
1,Not so easy to use.,"I think the main problem with this book is that it separate the pictures from the texts. What's more, it separate the pictures of leaves, flowers and fruits/nuts. This made it really time-consuming to find all the pictures and background of just one species... Imagine doing this in the field! How annoying it would be. Furthermore, perhaps because it's a book from last century, the printing of the text pages are not clear at all, my eyes hurt after reading it for more than 20 minutes. All in all, it's disappointing. Trust me! Don't buy this book!"
4,National Audubon society Trees,I found that the color pictures are very good and the descriptions are very helpful when in the office or outdoors. the only draw back is that it does not have descriptions of shrubs for the western region. I will look for a book on shurbs..
2,not what I expected,"In buying this book I was hoping to get an idea of the stories in Egyptian mythology since I knew little about it. I was disappointed however because the author spends too much time in my opinion on the origins for learning the myths rather than the actualy stories. He goes into great detail describing the temples and shrines that the actual glyphs were found in. He even goes to the lengths of telling what museum some of these artifacts can be found in. While this is also an interesting subject, in buying a book entitled Egyptian Myths I was really hoping just to learn what they were."
5,Best Kindle Envelope,"This case fits like a glove and provides just enough padding to keep things secure without making my kindle look like a pillow. I love the color of the case with the red fastners which really make this stand out. Some may find the leather string closure a little annoying, but it works really well once you get the hang of it."
3,So-So Start,"The book picked up steam as it went along, however, the ending was so convoluted with so many things happening and so many twists and turns that it was a bit hard to digest it all.I realize the author was going for humor in the first installment of what seems like a series, but she took it just a bit too far. Lime Jell-O mold on the head might be somewhat amusing, but added to a high-speed bookmobile chase, head-shaving and an old teacher in pink leather, it started to cross the line into silly and even ridiculous.The most annoying thing was the constant use of ""my laundromat."" We know it's hers...we didn't need to be reminded of it in every sentence.I'll read the next installment, but there's definitely much room for improvement as the series moves along. I just wonder how far it can move with such a limited character/setting base."
3,Domestic Diva Mysteries,"I ordered four different books in the Domestic Diva murder mysteries paperback books. I have been reading many murder mystery series written by women. Generally, I like the mysteries as the main character, a woman, is enpowered in the course of the novel or the series. Reading such material allows me to feel positive about women's thinking on serious subjects. However, the domestic diva series was not as expected. The writing was uninteresting. I'm sorry, as an avid reader, the books in the series did not hold any interest to me. I was hoping for a new murder mysteries series about women who used their intellect to solve mysteries. This writing was truly fluff."
5,Frank Davis...Real New Orleans food,"I am a native New Orleanian. This is one of my favorite cookbooks. New Orleans being a port city has a variety of cuisines ...French, Spanish, Italian and much much more. These recipes are unique to this area. I have alwaysenjoyed watching Frank Davis weekly cooking spot every Tuesday on WWL TV in New Orleans. I bought this cookbook for my niece for a Christmas present. I love the dialogue and the easy to follow recipes. Great tips. I would recommend this cookbook for everyone."
3,Missing something,"I can hardly distinguish between the mixes, save for the length of each. I was hoping for a mix you actually could dance to ....hopefully Krafty Pt. 1 is has a bit more variety. If I had to choose a favorite, I would say the Phones Reality mix is the best choice. And of course, the video is great."
5,Gimme one more chance!,Another maxi single with a typical New Order mark on it. Very interesting dance mixes and some new interpretations on the single. Buy it now!
4,Great Video but beware: PAL format,"This is a great instructional video but beware. This DVD is actually in PAL format. It will only play if you have a DVD player that can handle both PAL and NTSC formats (multisystem). The player also needs to be region free. The box didn't say what format it was in so it was pain to figure out the problem.I have 4 DVD players (Sony, Pioneer, jWin, and a Toshiba 7"" portable). It will only play on the portable Toshiba and the jWin (which is, ironically, a really cheap $30 model). On the Toshiba 7"" LCD screen the picture is fine. But on a regular set, the picture quality isn't that good because of the PAL conversion.Otherwise, the actual content is fantastic and the instructional method first-rate. The PAL format is the only thing that kept me from leaving 5 stars especially when it's listed here on Amazon as being NTSC."
3,Not NTSC,This DVD is NOT NTSC as advertised. It does not play on normal DVD players. It did play in my Mac computer.
4,Does the job.,"Appears to be hand made, you can see faint finger prints. This, too me, is a bonus It is sturdy and well made, performing as designed. Why not five stars? That would mean I wouldn't change anything, and I do feel that it is rather plain."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"The US military has decided to move more overtly after the Neo-Tokyo events. An aircraft carrier group is now on location, with both a scientifc and military purpose. They want to study the psionics, and see if they can gain control of SOL, among other things.Tetsuo is not a big fan of theirs, and decides blowing the crap out of them would be good."
3,Wild Times,"I was looking for books on New Zealand because I very much want to go there when I found this one. The title grabbed me straight off. I liked it because it wasn't a touristy book, but it gave enough information and history to make me thirsty for more. The author hits the high spots and throws in his own humor that kept me reading. I recomend this book to anyone who wants a charming look at Coaster history and society, and what it has to offer a vacationer."
5,Great first humidor!,"I didn't go with a smaller humidor so that I would have room to grow and with a low price of $42, it wasn't much of a burden. It was well worth it. The appearance is great, the structure is sturdy, and the seal is excellent and it keeps the humidity level easily."
1,Terrible craftsmanship even for a cheap humidor.,"I bought this humidor thinking it would be nice to have a larger humidor with a nice window in it like the current 25 count I got from cheaphumidors.com. Boy did I make the wrong decision. Like another poster here I didn't receive the key to my box which I thought, ""Ok no big deal I wasn't plan on locking it anyways."" So I go to open the humidor and I hear this thunk noise when I lift up the lid...THE GLASS IS JUST FLOATING IN THE WOOD. It's not sealed in any way other than you can't remove it. I attempted to fix the glass myself thinking I could make the best of a bad situation but all I really did was cost myself the return. Lesson learned, don't buy a cheap humidor with a glass top unless it's from cheaphumidors."
1,"100-cigar Bally Glass Top Humidor Review sold by Hometown General Discount, LLC","We had a few issues with the Humidor when it arrived. The separator that was on the bottom was slightly cracked and the Humidor would not go above 55% humidity. We thought there might be an issue with the Hygrometer, but we took that out and calibrated it and had no issues. After doing that we realized there definitely was an issue with the Humidor maintaining the proper humidity level. The product itself looked awesome. The inside smelled of cedar and the outside of the box was a beautiful wood color, but unfortunately had to return.I will say the vendor Hometown General Discount was very good to work with, they shipped the humidor in the time frame specified and they accepted the return and credited the account back in a reasonable time frame.Hopefully we just got a bad humidor out of a large batch.Best of luck to the rest of you in your purchases!"
3,Humidor,"Bought as Christmas gift for husband, received on time. Box is clean and attractive, spacious with upper shelf and 2 lower compartments with movable divider. Well crafted. The only issue is the analog humidity gauge did not work and after contacting the seller, they did offer to send a replacement, but also recommended buying a digital gauge for accuracy. We declined the replacement as my husband already had a digital gauge. But, him being what he is, he calibrated both gauges. The analog was accurate during calibration, but when placed in the opening in the front of the box, would not work. So make sure you have a digital, never rely on analog."
2,Disappointed,I ordered this item as a birthday gift for a family member and unfortunately it did not work properly. I had to return the item and would have been happy with a replacement if the customer service wouldn't have been so poor. Not once was their an apology- not for the poor quality for the particular item I received and not for the waste of my time because I had to return it. I would not refer this company to anyone based solely on their lack of professionalism and common courtesy to a paying customer.
1,Where's the key?,"This humidor is what you would expect for $60, not great, not terrible either, low end quality... Its a larger $20 box (like you would get in a tobacco store) but with a glass top, crooked lock and humidity gauge... and mine came without a key. I called Amazon and was told to contact the company for a key. I tried to contact the company but only get an answering machine that instructs businesses to leave a message. So disappointing, such a senseless hassle.. If I could return this I would and I'd spend the extra $40 and get a good humidor and deal with a more reputable company... but I haven't been able to, so it will sit on the shelf in my office and be a constant reminder that I am idiot for being a cheapskate."
4,Great for the money,Like everything about this product so far. So far the humidity has not gone above 59%. Not sure why but will give it some time.
3,"Good smelling humidor, crappy hygrometer","The humidor itself seems to be in good shape (the cedar smells amazing), but the hygrometer that came with it is a useless piece of plastic. Tried recalibrating it 4 or 5 times without any luck."
2,winter not so good,"In the summer this humidor is fine, but works horribly during winter. Probably due to lower ambient humidity. Although the seal seems very good (close test), itt is not very good at keeping the humdity. Invest a little more money if you live in an area with colder winters."
1,"Save your money, maybe spend more","I have now had this product for about 3 months and it is terrible at holding humidity. Although i live in an arrid climate, this humidor is not worth any amount of money since it will not hold humidity above 55%. I've seasoned it several times, spent nearly two hundred dollars on humidification systems. I recently purchased another humidor (Comtemprary), and I'll write a review on that one when the time comes in about 3 months."
4,"Good humidor, great price!",Great looking humidor with a glass top allowing you to gaze on your cigars without opening.
3,Hygrometer useless,"The humidor itself is fine, but the spring-based hygrometer is useless and cannot be calibrated. It just reads 40% RH all the time for me.I wish this humidor was available without a hygrometer. I have to put something in just to fill in the front. I have a Caliber III internal hygrometer. I guess I'll have to get an Adorini hair hygrometer to fill in the front."
2,Not bad!,"This is not a bad product but except the very good concertos by Kissin, there's nothing memorable here. If you're looking for a complete piano (solo) works set, buy Ashkenazy instead. Much better!"
4,pretty good for cheap strings,"these strings are great for the price, they sound nice and are pretty long lasting but dont last or sound as nice as higher end strings but who cares when the strings are affordable. these strings are great for people are starting because its cheaper and its not a big deal when you break a lot of strings."
4,STRING LIGHTS,"I'm pretty happy with these strings. They have a nice feel and are easy to bend, while having a bright crisp tonality. However, you pay for all that on the bass side because they are a little weak in that aspect. I'm using them on a ""Little Martin"" parlor-type guitar which has a pretty mild bass tone anyway, so I enjoy the brightness that these strings offer. They are very inexpensive and last pretty well if you take care of them. All in all a great product!"
5,Aged to perfection.........,There is a considerable difference in deeper tones and resonance when used with an aged Spruce top acoustic guitar. Your best buy for the money.
5,worked fine,My son had the strings on his guitar in a fairly short time and was pleased with the sounds they made.
2,Just okay,I replaced the factory strings on my daughter's Yamaha FS 720 S with these and immediately noticed that the sound was thinner and more tinny.Won't buy again.
5,guitar strings,I really liked this product. It came very soon after I ordered it and they work great! They had great sound and everything. :)
2,just dont like them allways out of tun,there is not a lot to say about them that was my money for something i can not get no uses of of them nothats not wot i was paying for but now i cant not play it thats money im out of!!!!!!!!!!!! not r they going to make good for it????????????????/
1,Don't Buy These!,"These strings are terrible. I put them on my guitar and they would not tune! The high E string snapped before I even tuned it. They sound awful, they sound like metal clanging together. Worst guitar strings I have ever bought, and I am very disappointed with what I got."
2,"Not great, but cheap","The strings just weren't good quality. They didn't sound great, and went out of tune really quickly, but I was just looking for something that would work until I got real strings, and that's exactly what I got."
3,Blame Amazon,"These look like nice strings but they came up at the top of the list for this search ""light nylon guitar strings""I was in a hurry, I didn't notice ""accoustic"" in the description...My badI still Blame Amazon..."
2,Poor quality,"Got it yesterday..Poor sound, and one string broke one day after successfully installed, automatically...I should have known it, cheap price gives nothing"
4,Pretty good but i like Extra Lights,"I tried these out, but decided i like the extra light strings better. These sound a little louder but that's about it. The extra lights are loud enough and easier to play."
5,Great product,Great product. Use them all the time. And the price was great. I use them on my Acoustic guitars. Thank you.
3,Broken strings,Needed to replace some broken strings and this was a economical choice to replace them with. Not bad but there is better.
5,5 stars and two thumbs way up!,"I thought that this was a very good book, and even though I am 17, it is still a good book to read. I have almost all of his books, which I got a long time ago. I have always enjoyed reading these kinds of books."
3,Only bought for one song,"Bought this Cd only because I'm a huge Doobie Brothers fan & wanted their performance of ""Black Water"" for my collection. Otherwise, the Cd is average & unless your a huge fan of the ""Today Show"" or one of the artists on the CD. Nothing exceptional here."
2,Is it worth a penny?,"My answer is ""yes"". Why? Because the cover is cool.Despite that ringing endorsement, I don't recommend reading any of the Worlds of Power books. For nostalgia, I recommend simply playing the games. But if you had to read one, for some reason, this would be the one to read. As a third grader, I found it touching, in places. As a nineteenth grader (third year of grad. school?), I can't think of a single reason to read it again. But, a penny is a penny, and those stocking do need stuffing..."
5,Awsome book.,"Yet another classic from F.X.9, it combines totally cool weapons, awsome enemies, and a great plot. This is a must read for any age."
1,"nice pen, but only one in my pack worked","I love this pen, but it doesn't seem to have much ink and one of the pens in the pack didn't work at all - I wish they did, I would order more. Also, too expensive to return, not worth the money."
4,Awesome Product,I try my best to stick with all natural remedies so I'm always looking for EFFECTIVE products. While this allergy spray didn't help my husband who gets really bad allergies in the Spring due to pollen....it helps me with my everyday post-nasal drip allergies.I only have to use it like 2-3 times and my allergies will go away. I love it! I love that I can give it to my kids too with no side effects.
2,Don't waste your time,"There are many well-written, persuasive books on how to have a great birth. This is sadly not even close. What you have here is a rambling, punctuationally challenged, poorly written, typo-ridden excuse for a book. There is one excellent point made (thus 2 stars given), which I will summarize here to save you the trouble of reading this book: If you are pregnant and you want to be one of the ones talking about how great your birth was, do what the people who rave about their births do: hire a good midwife, take Hypnobirthing classes, and have a homebirth. If you want to be one of the women with a horror story to tell, do what the women who tell horror stories do: hire an ob (surgeon), take no classes or only the hospital-offered ones, and go to the hospital. There. That is the ONLY thing worth reading from this book, and I've given it to you fast and free. Now go on to read a really excellent book about birth, like something from Henci Goer."
3,Rather Judgemental,"As a daughter of a doula, and someone who tried to have a home birth and then had to have an emergency transport, I am very open to home birth and think in many cases it is the best way. However, I thought the author of this book spent way too much time dwelling on the negative aspects of a hospital birth and not on the positive aspects of a home birth. Not only that, she really didn't leave room for any options. As I said, I had to have an emergency transport to the hospital after trying at home for 30 hours to have a natural birth. I cannot accept guilt for my decision, sometimes these things do not work out, no matter how badly we want them to. Also, I didn't appriciate how judgemental she was about breastfeeding, both I and a friend of mine tried desperately to breastfeed, we tried everything and it didn't work for us. Women don't need guilt like this, they need a positive representative of home birth."
5,A Must Have for Pregnant Moms,"This is my favorite book to give as a shower gift. I love it so much that I've already given several as gifts to family and friends. I also started selling it because I decided that this was a book that my students had to read.This book is like a roadmap for pregnancy and birthing. I thought I knew a lot as a childbirth educator but I was surprised by how much I learned from this book. I really wish I would have had this one during my first pregnancy, I would have made some different choices.I think it would be the best book to buy when you first find out you are pregnant. It would save so much heartache and pain during labor.This book is also helpful for doulas, midwives and childbirth educators. They will certainly have a better births if they have their clients read this book and it will help them to become better teachers. It has helped me to be a much more effective teacher.Overall, I give it 5 stars. I can't wait to see any other books that Ms. Wildner writes."
5,Genius,"Definitely one of the best books of it's kind I've gotten the opporunity to read. Loved the pictures - and the advice is good, even though some things are near impossible for the average human. Very nice spectrum of information."
2,not THAT super!,"I did not learn anything new that i have not read in cosmo (the magazine). Actually I would rather read cosmo then this book... There are a few positions to try... nothing new. And a few suggestions on oral sex and other things such as turn ons. Overall, the book was ok, the pictures were a let down and i would not recommend this book to anyone. I was not that impressed with it."
3,sort-of super,"This is a great book to look at. The text and color are fabulous and the pictures are photos of the pretties people Mr. Davis could find. But I ended up feeling like I was reading a compilation of Cosmo articles. I'd heard all the advice before, and felt like I was comstantly waiting for something new and unusual. This is a great book for the younger audience (I wouldv'e had great fun with it at slumber parties circa ninth-tenth grade), but for mature adults who need some good, honest, smart advice, this book falls a little short!"
3,Change...,"This disc features several good songs, the most notable being, of course, ""Change of Heart."" They are offering this up at an attractive price. Check it out! Three stars!!"
1,Easy Read but save your time & money,"Just pick up the phone and dial.In a nutshell, that is what the book says to do.If you're looking for some new ideas or that 'silver bullet', it's not here."
3,Good for beginners,"This is a great book for people that want to add telephone propsecting to their marketing arsenal. It gives all of the basics that seasoned pro's eventually learn. The best thing i got out of the book is the ""key is to gradually build up your confidence to the point where you begin to understand that the negative thoughts that impede you from calling are false."" So instead of buying the book, just keep cold calling until you build a big mental muscle to overcome the call reluctance and realize that people are really nice to talk with. the book is not worth the price."
2,Save your money,"I've been in sales management for years. This book is not bad but it's not not good either. The bad parts seem to be original and the good parts have been lifted from other books. There are better books by Tom Hopkins and Tony Robbins. My favorite book on the subject is Dudley & Goodson's book. The author of fearless cold calling must like it too. That's probably where he got a lot of his material. Save your money. Buy Hopkins or Robbins or Dudley & Goodson. All the sociology degrees in the world won't won't improve what this book is missing, credibility and originality."
2,Suggestion,"This book will probably do no harm, but it concerns me that it is an oversimplification. If overcoming the fear was that easy, why would you need this book? Spend your time and your money (it is only about 2 dollars more) for the real bible on the fear of cold calling, and go with the proven, scientific research of George Dudley and Shannon Goodson."
5,Great striker!,Build quality is good. Strikes a fat stream of sparks. There's enough room in the case to stick in some lint or char cloth.
5,Awesome Product,I ordered this along with the fire starter cubes and its a great combo. The Strike force sprays a lot of sparks to start a fire. When paired with the fire starter cubes you can make a fire anywhere. Perfect for a bugout bag or for the prepper.
4,Disciples Prayer Life - Excellent Workbook,Excellent Bible Study book for a class offered at my Church. It's one of the best investments I've made. Really gives an indepth understanding of God and how to personally relate deeper in prayer. Well written and good study excercises.
4,Good album,"I bought the album just to get ""Wheels"", long a favoritw of mine, but the other selections are good, too."
1,Horribly written account of a true story by a poor writer.,This book is written as though it was the 'Old Testament'. In fact it contains more 'scripture than details of the happenings.
4,Additional details on this performance,"The previous review recommended obtaining the ENO Opera Guide to Don Carlos for a libretto. This is available for $11.44 from Calder Publications in the UK. Note also, that Opera Rara has instituted a series of Verdi opera presentations of these broadcasts. I have obtained Macbeth, the first, and is contains a libretto and the typical high Opera Rara quality of literature, etc. Don Carlos is on the list of those to be issued and will be a state of the art version of this same performance."
2,No mind over no muscle - just a fancy title,"if you are interested in the history of Judo then may be this is the book as it is ""supposed"" to be written by the founder. But there are more comprehensive books around on the history and the evolution of judo from jujitsu and how it becomes a sport in Olympics. However, if your expectation is to read about how to use your ""mind over muscle"", learn or even get a slim insight of a little bit practical skills and technques, they just aren't there - zero."
4,Rotten Ralph is funny,My 5 year old daughter finds this book hysterical. I like reading it to her. I agree with the other person that the cat should have consequences for hurting the other persons's feelings and being so bad. His owner should give him consequences for his bad behavior.
1,Irwin Laser saw guide did not work at all.,When I installed the Laser guide on my saw and turned on the saw the laser did not come on at all. Very disapointing. No laser light at all.
4,21st century for 20th century tools!!,"I installed this on my 20 year old B&D power miter box, and what a difference. Instantly, I knew exactly where the blade was going to cut, without having to sight along the edge of the blade, as I had been doing for many years. You do have to keep the arbor bolt and nut extra tight, to avoid blade slippage. But I'm going to try a drop or two of silicone sealer between the laser and the blade, and see how that works. Regardless, it's a neat device; wish I could fit one on my wet saw!!"
2,Laser Guide,"Made my saw blade wobble and reduced the thickness of material I am able able to cut. It works but limits the saw, i wouldnt buy it again."
4,Murder remote/ Shrouded way,"A very enjoyable mystery/romance set in a village in Scotland. Lots of local color. But buyers beware, Murder Remote and The Shrouded Way are the same book with different titles! I didn't read the blurbs closely enuf and ordered both. This book is not up to the standard of PERTURBING SPIRIT by the same author, but that was probably my favorite novel of its genre that I have read. I strongly recommend Murder Remote (The Shrouded Way)."
5,Great Bed Shampooer at Bargain Price,Yes...you can spend more for the high sides and fancy look of the more expensive items. But why? We use this for an adult in a hospital bed and it works very well. Plus it is portable! Blow it up initially to 95% capacity...let it stretch for an hour or two...then inflate fully (it stretches). Vendor had great price. Compare and save with timely delivery. Fully satisfied.
5,Great Birthday gift!,I bought this for my niece for her 4th B-day and she loved it not only was it cute it's very durable and I witness her listening to keiysha cole in it every time singing word from word great gift she really enjoyed it.
1,Are you a real person or a runway model?,"Most of these hairdos are not for regular people. Some are so ridiculous-looking, sort of like the bizarre haridos you sometimes see runway models wear but that you never see anyone else in public wear? Several styles look like the model just rolled out of bed, stuck her finger in an electrical socket, or perhaps is having some sort of substance-abuse problem. Don't waste your money on this book."
3,5 minute trendy up-dos,Not what I expected. Most of the styles are for teenagers. It would have been nice to know that these styles are more for teenagers. But it is a very good book for that age group. The book came in excellant condition and in a timely manner. I would order again from this seller.
1,A waste of money,I shared this booklet with the rest of the stylists in my salon. It received nothing more than a good laugh. The styles are nothing that any of us would dream of wasting our time( if even only 5 minutes) and the hard earned money of our clients on. Even my 17 year old daughter told me how ugly the updo's were and threatned to never let me touch her hair or her friends hair again If I ever did a hair-do as hideous as these were.
2,Skip it!,"This show is poorly written and hurried through. They don't get very deep into any one subject and just when you get interested in what they are saying, they go onto to something else. There are better shows out there on this subject. A&E and History Channel have great documentaries on the supernatural."
4,Blood Sex Magik,"This book makes no apologies. It's sexually graphic. It's violent. There are no pure of heart heroes. All fine qualities that make this book of dark fantasy enjoyable to read.The short stories are well done. The author doesn't waste pages and each story comes to a satisfying conclusion. All the short stories except the first revolve around sexual fantasy. It's not [x-rated], per se, but it wouldn't take much effort to move it into that category, if you catch my drift.The included novel, Caliban, is an engaging story centered around the struggle for personal power and revenge. A bit on the bleak side, but hey, this ain't no Dean Koontz novel, thankfully.Recommended."
1,Ick,"Got this for a Christmas present. Plugged it into my Dell Inspiron laptop and it lit up, detected and I was able to plug a keyboard and mouse in and then blamo it died. No light no nothing. Tried on several other computers and the thing is dead. Lasted a whole 8 seconds.Very cheap - get what you pay for I guess.I would advise to stay clear."
1,crap,"just like the other two reviews state, i too plugged it in, it worked for about a minute maybe less and bam, dead. all i had was a mouse and a number key pad and they both worked for a few seconds and it died. i tried it again and it did the same thing. i'm returning it and getting a belkin like i should have done the first time."
2,Title misleading,"the words ""self powered"" in the title made me believe the hub had an ac adapter and was true powered hub..it is not, its a bus-powered hub. Title was misleading. Too cheap to be worth shipping it back though."
4,Observation,"My familiarity with this camera is limited to the information on amazon.com, so my observations should be taken as that of a spectator rather than a true critical review. Nevertheless, we all make judgments as to purchases without actually handling the item, especially on-line. This is based on the criteria I would apply if I were considering purchasing this item.I would expect a camera in the $1500 range to have more than a 3.2x optical zoom. Cameras costing less than one-third of that now have up to 10x optical zoom. 3x optical zoom is rapidly being relegated to low-end or ultra-compact cameras, neither of which fits the Leica. It is more in the price range of digital SLRs with interchangeable lenses, so I would expect a more powerful lens if there is no option to change it."
5,Harry Manx is my hero,Manx opens a new listeners mind to what is possible with a unique style that combines bluegrass with indian roots. His years living overseas before returning to Canada have shown to add to the broad range of influence from where he draws such a unique sound. His lyrics are thought filled and one of a kind and i would reccomend this CD to anyone who is trying to expand his bluegrass/new age folk horizons.
5,Tremendously talented.,"I just saw an interview with Harry Manx on a Canadian Blues programme called ""Talkin' Blues"". I have to say i was totally knocked out by his very sincere approach, his gentle manner and calm and happy countenance.He's got to be one of the nicest musicians on the planet. He's also tremendously talented having studied the Mohan Vina under the guidance of V.M. Bhatt for 5 years in India. This is NO easy task.His sound reminds me of Kelly Joe Phelps but perhaps his style is a tad more varied.If you buy any CD of Harrys i don't think you'll be disappointed at all."
2,Double vision,"If you're sober and viewing this watch, it's just plain ugly. Have a few drinks, and you'll think that your vision is impaired. I wouldn't buy this watch in either condition!"
5,Outstanding,Beautiful and comprehensive for the periods covered. If you like skyscrapers you'll love this book
1,Bad impression,I have not received the book. It is the second time I make a purchase and not get what I bought. I am very dissatisfied with the service. It is very unlikely to return to make a purchase through Amazon
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on!,"This author is stunningly ignorant about the book's subject matter! But what do you expect from someone who also writes books about horses, rabbits, fish, ferrets and parakeets? For starters, the Alaskan Malamute is no more ""ancient"" than 1935, the year it was registered with the American Kennel Club. I could go on and on and on, but to do so would mean writing an accurate book and no one is paying me to do it."
5,A Prospective Mal Owner,"As a prospective Mal owner I found this book very imformative, more so than some of the larger and more expensive books which I have in my collection. Especially the section ARE YOU THE RIGHT PERSON FOR A MAL. I found this especially interesting as a Mal is not suitable for just anyone. A well written book with plenty of good information which some other books don't cover enough. I recommend this book to anyone, new and old Mal owners alike."
4,Great training tool,"Standard equipment in knife training. Perfectly sized to replicate a fighting knife or bayonet. Stiff enough to let you know when you've been ""tagged"" but not sharp enough to hurt you. I would recommend that anyone who is learning how to defend from knife attacks own one. Well worth the price!"
2,No manual controls,"When set to manual, it just gives you full power. No manual adjustment in the power control. Item was returned for this reason."
3,609s not made in USA,"I just bought a pair of 609s, so I can't comment on the durability. What did surprise/disappoint me is the discovery that these New Balances are made in China, not the US as I thought all NBs were made. Part of my rationale for buying these was the belief that I was supporting American workers and a company committed to staying in the US. I didn't realize they outsourced some of their manufacturing.One thing I can comment on off the bat is that these 10EEs definitely feel tighter than other wide NBs I've worn in the past. I've got a pair of Asics regular width and these 'wide' NBs feel just as tight. If you're going to buy online and want the feel of a wider width along the lines of a 2E, perhaps consider going with a 4E(if they make them) or opting for a different style of New Balance."
2,"Great fit, poor quality","Love the way the shoe fits, but after less than six months of very minimal wear (I don't run, don't hike and basically sit on my duff all day) the leather is ripping away from the sole at the toes."
2,Shoe runs narrow,"Bought these for my son who takes a 8 EEEE. I and he have been wearing NB for years as I take a 9 EEEE. Anyway, these are too narrow for him. His foot is pushing the tongue way up and the laces have to be loosened all the way. And the shoes still aren't wide enough. Compared to 608s which were wide enough nlast time. They are not the same width as previous new balance shoes which always fit us perfectly. We can both wear Avia, I have have bought their shoes and they are fine but I like both brands. Can't wear 609s though"
5,Favorite shoes ever,These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. Please continue to make these.
2,A disappointment...,"I've had nothing but praise for New Balance shoes before I received these 609's. In the first three days of use, the heel padding wore through on both shoes (never happened so soon on my other NB shoes), so badly that I had a nasty blister on my left heel. A shoelace eyelet ripped out, too. I'm just surprised at how poorly these held up. I'm not ordering shoes online again. Better to get the right fitting shoe at a store."
4,Satisfied,While I've always been a 608 fan the last ten years or so I was tempted to try the 609 model out. Very comparable in design and quality but it does appear they have ramped back a bit. Still all leather (assuming) upper and comfortable sole but the logo and some stitching has been sacrificed. I wear my sneakers to work as well as play and the 608 would give me a solid year and a half of daily abuse before needing replacement. I'll give the 609 a year at best. New Balance makes a decent shoe for the $$. I've paid more for less for sure.
5,New Balance - A Great Deal!,"The shoes came in days before expected, and are everything we have come to expect from New Balance - - comfort, good looks, an all-around good deal."
1,WORST COMPANY EVER - DO NOT BUY FROM SHOES.COM,"I bought the sneakers, tried them on and had them on my feet no longer than 3 MINUTES.. I returned them expecting a refund. According to shoes.com they claim the sneakers appeared to be ""worn"" and they do not accept returns for ""warn"" sneakers. I explained to the customer service woman that the sneakers DIDN'T FIT ME and I only ""wore"" them for 3 minutes, not more than that. I also said to her ""Why on earth would I wear a pair of sneakers that DON'T FIT?""She got quite rude and said that ""whatever the warehouse says the condition of the item is, that's what we follow"" It would be impossible to even remotely find any issues with the shoes, they were returned in PERFECT CONDITION!I'll be buying from shoebuy.com, it was a mistake NOT buying from them again in the first place."
1,Safety Issues of NB Men's 609 Sport Shoe,"I like wearing the NB Men's 609 Active Shoes. However, when wet, they are like 'walking on black ice'. I have fallen twice in fast food restrooms on wet tile floors. There is no traction when the soles are wet.At home, I tested my NB shoes with another of my name brand shoes. Again, the NB soles are very slippery, creating no traction. I believe there is a flaw in the NB Mens 609 that cancause a very serious injury when wet."
3,slick on wet asphalt,"I've had various NB cross training shoes over the years and really liked them. But I've never had any that were so slippery on hard wet surfaces as these are. Even after a few weeks of wear, they are still like ice skates when the walking on wet sidewalks and roads. Be careful!!!"
5,Can't Ask for More of What a Shoe Does,I've had 609's for what seems like donkey's years. Three years at least. I don't understand the comments about poor quality. The only negative I can think of is that the laces are twice as long as they need to be and I end up stepping on them if they are not tied right. These things still have another year to go at least. I've been looking at other NB models to possibly upgrade. But why spend $80 when I can still get the same great shoe for $60? I know my size and the shoes come in the same color I am now wearing. One click of the mouse and they'll shortly be on my doorstep!
4,Very interesting...unique subject matter,The book is extensive (in my mind) and covers many of the most boneheaded airplanes ever developed.
3,Juice's CD,"In the beginning, I didn't know. As I listen to it more and more, I realizes her voice isn't quite the same as the voice in the [...] It might be another person imitating her voice or a ""digitally remastered"" voice which I am quite sure what it means. At any rate, I am not totally satisfied with the product."
4,A Modern Classic on Coptic Orthodoxy,"This book, though small in size, is enormous in the breadth of information on the Coptic Orthodox Church it offers. I would not recommend this book as a final step in anyone's journey to knowledge of the ancient Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt, but it is an excellent beginning or median reference work that is sure to fill in missing gaps and tie concepts together. I do, however, agree with those who fault the binding for being weak; if you use this book frequently, prepare to have it rebound."
1,sent to the wrong buyer,"I bought this book, Unfortunately is seems it was sent out prior to my purchase.I contacted the seller and was told to go to amazon.You would have thought they would have sent back my money after the emails sent:("
4,Broken Things,A wonderfully 'cleanly' written book about challenges and choices we make in life and the directions they often lead us.All though this is slightly Utopian in nature it is more uplifting than depressing. It would also be a good book for book clubs with a variety of discussion topics.Allie has an opportunity to reconnect with others from her past and re conciliate any wrongs.
5,A great read!,"I had never read an Andrea Boeshaar book prior to this one and I have to say that she has brought me back to contemporary Christian novels. This book is well written, with a few exceptions(a lot of sauntering & smirking), and I was enticed to continue reading the other two books available in this series. This book will challenge your walk with Christ as the characters struggle with their lives past, present, and future."
1,Broken Things by Andrea Boeshaar,"Anyone who has ever suffered through a broken relationship will find encouragement and comfort in Andrea Boeshaar's Broken Things, a story of hope for today's world. The characters are warm and genuine, and one cannot help rooting for them as the plot unfolds. I truly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it."
2,Nightmare - but it works,"I have been struggling with this thing for 4 days.1. Book is poorly written. It talks about things you can do, without clearly explaining how. (No details, or examples given!)2. Help is just the book - again.3. Tutorial is cumbersome, worst one I have ever come across.4. However, 30 days phone support is included. The problem is that the techs are not up to speed on this program either. After a phone call, I was able to use the program, in its most basic form. As far a using multiple re-dos, Corel techs didn't know anymore then I did. 5. When a knocked out image is sent back to photoshop - you don't see it as knocked out - you have to drag it into another screen. This is one of those ""little"" things that the instructions don't cover, that drove me crazy."
4,A friend of James Crumley,"and Crumley writes the intro. If that is not enough of a recommendation, you need to read more. Our hero is another man of dubious goals, who becomes involved with very bad people, while looking for employment and love in all the wrong places. Good action. Interesting grammar. South Texas has a hero."
2,Yoga Breathing shouldn't lead to hyperventilating,"I tried this video, and couldn't make it past the first ten minutes of the first trimester. She goes so fast while telling you when to inhale and exhale and i found myself hyperventilating and had to stop. My husband gave it a try as well and barely made it as far as I did. It is just too rushed, causing me more anxiety and failure to breathe correctly. Not worth it. I will have to go find a new one tomorrow."
2,I'd get a different video,"The production quality on this DVD is horrible. It sounds like something I could make in my backyard. This I would overlook if it was an outstanding yoga workout. But in the second trimester, some of the moves involve moving from a flat, lying position to a backbend like move very quickly, and it makes me dizzy every single time. I doubt I am the only pregnant lady this would happen to. I am a beginning yogist, but not completely inept. I liked having three workouts tailored by trimester, and the rest of the moves were good, but I wish I had purchased a different DVD."
1,Waste of Money,Bought these a couple weeks ago....one of them broke within a couple days of wearing them. Spend a little more money and get yourself a decent pair. Don't waste a dime on these.
2,Mostly immature bragging,"There were several very good chapters about the early explorers and fur traders. But for the most part, these were overshadowed by the rest of the book which contained mostly bragging about how stupid people can really act and get away with it. The chapters about the dope-head rainbow people, the drunk bull riders and the whore chasing RVers were totally one sided and mostly unnecessary for such a book. It seemed like Grant was just using these stores as a springboard for telling his own life story about what he likes and dislikes and how much beer he can drink. Some good, mostly BORING."
4,Good read,"Some of this was terrific, some not so hot! Overall, a good read. For sure it was interesting and unique."
4,baseball cap,"This cap looks great, but again, it is a Christmas gift, so I'll have to see how the gifteee likes it !"
4,Works fine for intended use,"I've only ever used these pencils to fill holes left by countersinking nails in new construction and for that, they work. Be sure to do all of your other finishing (wood stain, polyurethane, etc.) prior to using the product because it's just colored wax after all. As your last step, use a Blend-fil pencil of the appropriate color to fill holes and make them blend in. It doesn't surprise me - as the other reviewers noted - that these pencils do a lousy job of repairing scratches. I don't think the manufacturer intended them to be used for that, however."
1,Nice idea,"This book contains a nice idea, though the designs in the book are not great examples of the art form. Someone wishing to learn how to design with formlines might be better off using an exhibit catalog such as Kwakiutl Art or maybe An Analysis of Form by Bill Holm. There are many subtleties in the art and this book makes a valiant attempt to describe the art form but in the end fails in terms of examples and description."
3,log,The book was okay but sloppily researched but understandable given it was probably published in the late 1800s.
4,Beautiful book!,"We keep buying this for children, but all the adults who see this are mesmerized! A winner!"
3,Disappointed,"Because my computer crashed and I replaced it with a newer one with Windows 7, I can't use this game. I now need a game compatible with 64-bits."
1,Yukon trail?,The game would not load on my computer. There was no way the grandchildren could play this game. They need to update their product.
1,Could not use it with my computer,"I bought this, since it was part of the ""Trail"" series, but was unable to use it on my computer. I have Windows 7 and this does not work with Windows 7. The description mentioned it worked on Windows. Seller should put on his site what versions of Windows it will work on. It was a waste of money, since it would cost more to send it back, and it is unusable."
4,Great Memories,"This is a memorable album, each track will warm your heart and soul and fill them with warm memories of one of the greatest voices of all time."
4,Olympus Leather case,Camera fits nicely in the case. Small compartments to hold extra battery. Also has loop to attach to your belt to avoid loosing it.
5,My kids' favorite toy,"I was surprised to read the negative reviews on this toy. It was both my daughter's and son's favorite toy at 1 year of age, so naturally I thought to buy it for my nephew's first birthday. It is still in perfect condition and plays beautifully. Yes there are less expensive pianos with a lot more features, my kids have those too. But honestly all of those features are superfluous for a toddler and have the tendency to drive parents crazy (who needs to hear a kid pounding on a piano board with horn sounds and a back up drum beat?). This toy is worth the extra money."
5,The best all around instructional video.,If you love the game and know the game and want to teach the game this video has it all. It is a must have.
3,Good,I think it would be good supplemental reading for folks early into their recovery. It's OK reading for old timers.
5,excellent thinking,Dr. Paul has always been a pleasure to listen to; now I can say he's an even greater pleasure to read.
2,There's more to Quitting Drinking than Quitting Drinking,"I read this book after I read ""You Can't Make Me Angry"" by the same author. This was his first book and is much less stimulating, or informative, in my opinion, than ""You Can't Make Me Angry""."
5,Bags of Soul,I love Milt Jackson. His playing is just the best. The musicians on these CD's are incredible. I just love this compilation.
5,Surfin' Music,"It's fun to go back and listen to this music. Two songs predate Dean to the time when Arnie sang with Jan. The music is certainly from a more care-free, simpler era and puts some fun back into life for a short while."
1,bunk,"Lawrence Guiles' well-researched book on Tyrone Power is far and away superior to this very poorly put together hokum by Hector Arce. Guiles puts Power's life in an excellent perspective.One of the reviews mentions the acknowledgments, but there are no source notes, which all reputable biographies have. So as far as what anyone told Mr. Arce, we have no way of knowing, as he does not attribute the quotes. Unless you can call an anonymous source an attribution. I love the section where he talks about what Tyrone Power was thinking while he was alone. Wonder what his source was for that one. In the Audrey Hepburn book by Diana Maychik, she acknowledges people who in court said they never met her and never spoke to her. So forget the acknowledgments.If you enjoy fiction, this is the book for you."
1,National Enquirer in hardback,"This book leaves me searching for words to describe it. It rambles, expects the reader to accept what the author is saying without him naming his sources(to protect their privacy..whatever). With that aside it is badly written to add insult to injury. Some of it sounds absolutely juvenile.No wonder Tyrone Power's friends come out blasting this book. I only paid one dollar for my copy...and I still feel ripped off.If you are thinking about buying this book, go to the grocery store instead and get you a National Enquirer....it's on the same level.Since there was no ""zero"" to rate it.......I had to give it one star."
1,A secret to Power himself,"The title says everything. It must have been a secret life if no one intimate with Tyrone Power knew of his bisexuality. So if his friends and family didn't know this, then how can you expect a biographer like Hector Arce (how is that pronounced?) to know what Power was thinking when he was alone?Was Power bisexual? I don't know, never have claimed that I did. I think he may have had some homosexual encounters in his lifetime, but his main preoccupation seems to have been women. Along with his three marriages, he had affairs with Judy Garland, Lana Turner, Loretta Young, Janet Gaynor as well as other non famous women."
5,Great book!,My son loves this book and we have read it for two years now. It is not scary to him and still part of the Halloween spirit.
4,Fun bugs with pop ups,"Have to be very careful with toddlers while reading this, very fragile pop ups, which most are. Fun halloween bugs"
4,This has great content!,"I think that this is a really good book, however there are better. I reccomend this for kids just learning to read chapter books. However just because you're older then that doesn't mean you can't read it. It has good content. My teacher read my class a picture book in 4th grade. That doesn't mean we're that level. But she says it is a good example of writing. Read up!"
5,Great show,"I am reviewing on behalf of my wife, who said this was great. She said it's funny and witty, quite enjoyable. The ordering went smoothly and we have no complaints with the viewer or with loading onto our Kindle Fire."
2,Preview,Not mich to see or wnjoy so do not waste time or money onthis piece of video. I had no idea this would be so borin at all. So my advice just forget it.
2,not for me,"Free Agents Pilot is ""not"" original , is a copy of others series of tv. One more in the list : "" let's try get some money with this"".No future in this ""Free Agents"".Only suitable if you are young and never watch another ""Like this series""."
3,PR Cruisiing Guide,"I have used cruising guides for many years. Some are better than others, but one cannot safely navigate in shore without one. Pavlidis' guide is nicely written, and he has made corrections to GPS waypoints that were erroneous in earlier editions. His ""chartlets"" are nicely drawn, and his directions are easily understood. My main objection is that unlike most guides that are spiral bound (easier to keep open to a page under way) this guide is a soft-cover book. Remember, there are no other guides to the PR & DR out there except Van Sant's ""Gentlemen's Guide to Passages South"", which has very good info, but not as much detail about PR."
1,PR Crusing Guide,"Thought it important to note that there are some serious errors in this cruising guide. The basics are fine - but some navigational specifics are quite different from reality. For example, the entrance to a particular harbor near La Parguera was reported to have ""9-11' at the entrance"" - after carefully sounding the entrance found it to only carry 6-7'at the most. There are other examples of this as well that I have discovered in Vieques and on the south coast of PR. From my experience, cruising guides are typically conservative in their chartlets and reporting of depths - as they should be - but this one does not seem to be.I would not rely on this for anything but basic information."
1,"""Cruising guide"" to Puerto Rico","Poorly written, lacking in important information, overpriced, but otherwise OK. Maybe I have been spoiled by other cruising guides, but this one leaves a whole lot to be desired."
5,If you are Ready for Love... You are Ready for the Best,"I may have to rank this as the best cd Walter Beasley ever put out and that is saying a lot with all of the great music he has already had. His remake of Free and Be Thankful for What You Got are simply wonderful and soulful. I Miss You is another soulful song where Walter shows his vocal ability. She Move Me really slips up on you and gets you dancing in your seat and not notice. Walter is one of those artist that as soon as I hear he has something new I don't say let me hear it, I go buy it. Once again he made me feel like I got more than my money's worth."
3,"Worth it for former agent's Sherman, Newman, Paolella, & McIntyre","I modestly recommend this video, as it contains the on-camera comments of former Secret Service agent's Tony Sherman, Larry Newman, Joe Paolella, and William ""Tim"" McIntyre, all of whom I have spoken to and/ or corresponded with myself. That said, I do not endorse Seymour Hersh's book, per se...but there is much of value in what these agents have to say.Vince Palamara-JFK/ Secret Service expert (History Channel, author of two books, in over 30 other author's books, etc.)Pittsburgh, PABEST JFK ASSASSINATION BOOK: ULTIMATE SACRIFICEBEST JFK SECRET SERVICE BOOK: SURVIVOR'S GUILT BY YOURS TRULY :)"
3,Another Short-Played Hits Set By Curb,"Since his two Capitol albums are out of print, this is your only chance to get those hits. But with the inclusion of four big hits from his earlier period(available on dozens of compilations) instead of ""What's The Score"", ""She's A Heart Full"", ""Old Coyote Town"", ""Come From The Heart"" and ""Shot Full Of Love"", this is unwisely put together. Try to get the Import-Album 20 COUNTRY CLASSICS(1998) from EMI in Great Britain. Then you'll get both albums and all hits on one cd.With that said, not all his hits from the Capitol-period were top-notch either, especially boring ballads like ""Senorita"". Adding a horn section to ""Heartbeat In The Darkness"" made that one his last no.1 single, but I didn't like that direction particulary. The big stand-outs from these singles were Bob Corbin's ""I'll Never Be In Love Again"" and Bob McDill's ""Another Place Another Time"". Two heartfelt performances."
5,One of the Greats,"I don't think Don Williams knows how to sing a bad song. The man has a phenomenal voice. I already had most of the songs on this album, but there was one I loved and didn't have, and I believe this may be the only album it is on. That is the song ""Desperately"". I couldn't find it anywhere digitally so I ordered the CD. Consequently I added a few more songs I didn't have, like the beautiful ""Another Place, Another Time"". Do add this album to your collection. If I could give it 10 Stars I would."
5,Most current book on Software Configuration Management,"Excellant book. Probably the most current and up to date book on Software Configuration Managment that is available today. Marion stresses the program management focus and technical aspects of SCM while at the same time providing practical implementation advice. Including, how to safely ""violate"" the rules, which she calls ""cheating fair""!She covers the need to apply SCM to ALL development work products and files produced and used by the engineering team. A significant difference from the advice contained in classical SCM texts.I only found myself dis-agreeing on implementation approach in one or two minor areas.bob e v aka bob ventimiglia"
1,Only has a few good songs,The CD is ok. You may be better off just grabbing the hit song off I-Tunes. This is not a CD you will listen to more than once or twice.
4,Reconciliation - Episcopal style,"I am a former Roman Catholic who had not ""received"" the Sacrament of Penance for 30 years. I am now Episcopalian and found myself recently fascinated with ""forgiveness, reconciliation, confession"" - Episcopal Style. Martin Smith's book is one which touches the heart of the matter and leads the reader to appreciate what Reconciliation can mean to those who will choose to experience it through private reception from a priest."
3,jeanr,I loved the setting of this book. Who doesn't dream of living in a old castle in France? I did not get how the past owner's life fit together with the present owner's?
5,very good book,"I loved this book. It was a wonderful story, with a deep plot line and new and interesting settings. It was a fun read. If you like history, romance, legends, ""treasure"" hunts, you'll like this book."
5,A picture is worth a 1000 words,This book is a testament to Joseph H. Pilates and his unique system of exercise. To be able to see pictures of Joe and his more advanced students is a guide and an inspiration to students of Pilates. This book will appeal to those who practice Pilates with access to equipment. To these people it can be a manual well worth its price. Observing the form in pictures helps to do the exercise in proper form and learn new techniques. The volume and variety of exercises is also great. Once again a great book for pilates students.
2,Not two sided,The Amazon write up says they are two-sided as in earlier versions of Kodak Anytime Picture Paper but this batch even says on the instruction sheet NOT to print on the non-glossy side.
5,A wonderful recource!,"I was impressed by the amount of information they were able to cram into this book. I don't think that there was one aspect of storyboarding that was left out. It covers the techniques, tools, and methods artistically as well as how to approach it from a business stand point. This book has an overwhelming amount of examples(most of which are full color) of storyboard panels, useable forms, and reference. The recource section is invaluable to anyone in the field. It covers literally every aspect that I had a question about. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Awesome informative book,"This is a textbook I'm reading for my storyboarding class, and it has all the information a storyboard artist would ever need. Easy to follow, lots of examples, good exercises."
5,Sojourner a home run,"I just finished Andrew Mishkin's booked titled ""Sojourner"" and I couldn't put it down. Mishkin, a Senior Systems Engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), helped to design, build and operate humanity's first operational MARS rover. The book starts back in the 1960's with a General Motors built rover which was meant for, but not flown on, the Lunar Surveyor missions of that decade. He explains how this machine became the basis for several JPL skunk-works created machines including the one that finally did the job in 1997. The book contains just enough technical information (both hardware and software) to be interesting but not so much as to lose the non-technical reader. There are two added chapters which cover the missions in 2001 and 2004."
1,"Disappointing, spun, but well written.","On the good side, it is fairly well written. As a previous reviewer noted, however, the author makes much ado of the politics and conflict at JPL. In some chapters, it gets hard to read through the self-inflating undertone, but it seems fairly obvious that it is the author himself who is the cause of much of the conflict. And now that the era of ""faster, better, cheaper"" space disasters is behind us; it is clear that simple luck played a leading role in Pathfinder's success - a point the author somehow seems grieved to admit."
5,Excellent Book On Robotics,"In Sojourner, Andrew Mishkin does an excellent job of presenting the success of the Pathfinder mission to Mars, as well as the challenges of getting there. The book gives a brief, but thorough, history of robotics at JPL starting with the lunar rovers and working its way up to the creation of Sojourner and its clone Marie Curie. Mishkin has a talent of presenting technical material in a way that is easy to read and understand, yet provides enough of the technical information to excite and inspire engineers-myself included. Anyone with even the slightest interest in engineering robotics will gain much knowledge from this book!The book also provides insight into NASA's day-to-day operations during the mission. Explaining difficulties of scheduling shifts on Mars time, dealing with communications issues, and even correcting bugs in the system. Praise to Andrew Mishkin for this piece of history."
2,Author Mitchell makes Keaton look like a God,I am not a big fan of Debroah Mitchell's book Diane Keaton: Artist and Icon. She is an actress not a God. I will say I am a fan of Keaton but this book went to far. Hollywood stars today are treated like their better than everyone else. Liberalism is portrayed all over this book. Too much leftist talk for me!
3,South Beach Revisited,"This book is basically the South Beach Diet for the Francophile. There isn't anything new here; however, those who enjoy following South Beach would likely enjoy this book too."
1,Know Object Orientation in Java? DO NOT buy this book.,"I can't believe the reviews this book received on this list. I blasted through this book in a matter of days with zero idea where any of the five star reviews come from, let alone 4, or 3 stars.If you are a decent hacker in Java already, DONT buy this book, you'll waste your money like I did. It provides no 'secrets', is super lengthy without explaining anything difficult, and simply relates programming in Object Oriented environments in a way that I absolutely could not understand. Could be just me, but I found this book to be utterly worthless and am donating it to my fireplace for good consumption.Don't buy this book unless you haven't a clue what an 'interface' is, or what inheritance is/does/means, they spend FOREVER talking about this simple OO concept ;<.However, if you don't know OO, buy it I guess."
2,"100-page pamplet becomes a 300 page, $45 book","Is it the publisher or the author who had the idea of turning this pamphlet into an expensive book? Somebody should be ashamed. It uses the typical tricks--large fonts, wide margins, generous line spacing, repetitive sections, thick paper--to stretch the text out as far as possible. Even then, they still need some repetitive appendixes and an index to get past the 287 pages of margin-endowed material.Plus, they include a CD which is really just an advertisement for more products from the author. But we get to pay extra for it. The word ""hucksterism"" keeps coming to mind.All that said, the content of this pamphlet is excellent, and definitely worth reading. I just don't see why the authors didn't turn it into a white paper and put it on their site to help sell their other products."
1,Gets Nowhere,"I think the five or four stars are by some one from prentice hall itself. This book tries to do OO, UML and Java, but gets no where. The flow is not maintained. If you know Java a bit, do not buy it. It is waste of money and time."
1,There are much better OO book available,Poor writing and editing make this book very difficult to read! Uninspired coverage of OO design leaves me wondering where these 5-star ratings came from. More in-depth OO design articles can be found online.
2,Not good,"Bought this book thinking it will teach me as much possible about UML and using Java in the examples just made it more attractive. But I was disappointed when the authors only used two types of UML diagrams in this book(class and sequence diagrams). Where are the other diagrams? Markedly missing is the Use Case diagram, the authors just jump from initial specification to class digrams, totally ignoring the use cases. This style is followed throughout the book. The diagram sketches is another downpoint of the book, it doesn't matter if they were drawn by professional artists, they still look unattractive. To wrap it up, I wont recommend this as a good buy."
2,Some important ideas - very poorly presented,"There are some very important ideas communicated in this book. But it is not well written at all. The authors repeat themselves incessantly.There are also many errors. I am surprised to see that this is a second edition. I recommend that you wait for the third edition.The authors even voice opposition to some wonderful design methodologies that were invented elsewhere. No reason is given for their wariness of building objects that act like functions.Go to a bookstore, read the table of contents and Appendix A. That is really all they have to say. It's good stuff, though."
2,The most difficult-to-read Java book I've seen so far,"The premise of this book is excellent, but the execution leaves quite a bit to be desired. Coad's style is choppy and disjointed and I found it extremely difficult to read. I know of one other person who had such a hard time with the book that he gave up after 10 pages. I didn't make it much farther. You're better off with Bruce Ecker's ""Thinking in Java"" (available free online at www.eckelobjects.com/eckel) and a good OOD book such as Bertrand Meyer's ""Object-Oriented Software Construction"" or Scott Ambler's more accessible ""The Object Primer"""
3,"It was okay, but is not the last word on the subject","I read this book cover to cover. In my opinion a lot of the examples were rather contrived and not as related to the real world of professional programming and design as I would have preferred. The examples, I felt, had a lot of boring get/set methods but didn't teach anything about the java class hierarchy. I don't feel myself to be a better programmer or designer for having read this book. I think a better book is ""Java Design Pattersn: a Tutorial"" by James W. Cooper. Cooper's book has examples that in the process of teaching the ""Gang of Four"" design patterns uses simple swing examples that help to refresh the reader's memory of how to code simple Java GUI applications."
3,Good in Combination with other subjects,"This book has a place in introducing KISS (Keep it simple stupid) OOD rules of thumb. It does a good job of presenting a formulaic and repeatable approach to avoiding serious design pitfalls, but does only a mediocre job of explaining what the real impact of what it terms ""poor design"" decisions to be (i.e. impact to flexibility, maintainability, extensibility, etc). If you're involved with distributed programming and are looking to develop your architecture and design skills as expressed in UML modeling and Java implementation, read this book as a companion to ""The Art of Objects"", ""UML Components"" and ""Refactoring""."
4,"Pretty good book, a little expensive","Good OO concepts, but the book could be condensed into a much thiner and less expensive one. I didn't like the hand-written design sketches. The Author sells Together/J, there is no excuse for providing the readers with well formatted, UML based drawings. Unless the author thinks that hand-written sketches are more ""charming""..."
5,This book really opened my eyes,This is a great design book and an excellent tutorial in object-oriented design. Although the book uses Java I have already found myself applying some of the design techniques in C++.
5,Excellent combination of OO principles & Java concepts,I read with great pleasure this book. Being an enthusiastic Java programmer I really appreciated the excellent combination of OO design principles and Java concepts like interfaces.
2,Could have been a really great book....,"I had high hopes for this book given all of Peter's work in the past. There is good content in it but it is really in too rough of a form. Almost like finding a needle in a haystack.This ""book"" reminds me of what I would see come across my desk during the tech edit phase of the book, not the finished product. The CD-ROM does not add much value other than to the price of the book.I would really like to see this in a second edition. And lets try to stick with UML notation the next time around!"
5,"Easy to Understand, Useful",The one-line summary says it all. I found this to be a good balance of theory and practice. The code examples effectively illustrate the concepts. This book is for people who want to write code.
2,The First Book on Java Design,"That's how the authors refer to this book on the back cover... and it shows. After reading the first painfully practical chapter I found myself craving for the detailed, theoretical narratives of ""Design Patterns"".Don't get me wrong. I bought this book looking for examples and found them. But I was hoping for gems of wisdom and got a text book.Although, this book's saving grace is its examples. I find my self picking it up every few weeks seeing more and more of the experience the authors have packed in.I expect we'll see more mature Java OO books from these authors and others very soon. Wait for them."
3,Okay headset.,"This is a decent headset for the price, but it feels a little cheaply made and one of the ears only works sporadically after only using it for a few weeks. I'm fairly happy with the product and the malfunction doesn't bother me, but it's definitely not the best headset out there for this price. Keep looking, this one probably isn't worth your money."
3,"Not a bad book, just not a great one either.","I read the Irish Devil, and this does not compare. I will try another Lynn Bailey book to make sure this just wasn't a fluke. Don't misunderstand, if you don't have anything else, read it. it is just too predictable without any extras to make it worthwhile. I thought Nicholas and Rietta deserved a better story or at least a more adventerous one."
3,Ehh.,"This Certainly does not replace fresh lemon peel in recepies, but in a pinch, it will get the job done."
1,Corel KPT - no show,"Note the previous review dates for this product. I tried installing it on my new 27"" Mac, with no success. Photoshop does not recognize the plugins. I loved the old KPT filters; but they will evidently not work on the new Macs, and Corel has apparently made no effort to inform customers of this fact."
1,Corel KPT collection,"Corel KPT collection, a plug-in for Photoshop does not work in PS CS5. Nowhere is this information available at the time of purchase. So I wasted $99 and cannot use the software. I find this highly annoying. Worse, Corel does not offer support, since the product was not bought directly from them."
1,Previews too small to be of practical value,"The previews are so small that they are of no practical use for me. I use a 27"" monitor and the tiny previews are just totally useless. They are larger than postage stamps but that's about all the positives I can say for it."
3,certification problem,"The product is fine, but when I tried to register this, I received a message that the certification number was invalid. Please provide assistance with this. Thank you."
4,My first acid trip,"Odder than Oz.Wilder than Wonderland.Take the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. . .animate it. . .throw in a fat Transformer. . take a naked girl who sucks the life out of demonic force until she becomes a gigantic naked woman (who coincidentally earlier blew up Professor Shorty to orgasm). . .anime it. . .stick a detective--who never, incidentally, finished his first film--on the case of a psychotic dream implanter then top it with. . .Paprika (everyone's wet dream).""That's all folks."""
5,More Paprika please!!!!,"Well, the animation was impressive. The plot pulled me in, it really does have a matrix undertone to it, and since I liked the matrix, this was more of a reason for me to favor this film!!!!"
4,A Visual Rollercoaster,"Great Animation, Kon's best work...visually. The story on the other hand only serves as an excuse to keep this animation rollercoaster going. However, this film looks so good it never gets slowed down by the story. I think Millenium Actress tells a better story but Paprika is a three course meal for your eyes."
3,Not bad,"For an anime, you can rent it and not feel cheated. The story ideas are good but all in all it just was what it was. Not too shabby"
4,"Trippy film, terrible Blu Ray transfer","A wildly colorful, trippy film that has a similar dream manipulation theme as Inception, still has my head scratching yet wanting to see it again (because like my first viewing of Inception, it was a challenge to gather all the puzzle pieces). The same director created one my favorite Animes: Millenium Actress. He has such a wonderful ability to take you to another world. I love how his mind works.The colors and visuals are eye-popping; unfortunately, the transfer is no better than a regular DVD. Edges remain fuzzy and it was actually hard on my eyes. I've heard some blu ray critics say the soft pallette was intentional, but there's difference between soft and just plain fuzzy.I've yet to explore the extras (and there is a nice array). I am hoping one of them will help me delve into fully understanding this thought-provoking piece."
4,"A fun, twisted story.","The soundtrack definitely helped shape alot of my mood during the film. Good job there, as it was nice music---esp. the pop tune. As the story went, it was full of unpredictable scenes (anticipation is good in great movies), making me always wonder what's next. Some of the really strange scenes that had a sexual nature to them caught me a bit off guard, but it's funny 'cuz I also got a touch of pleasure out of it. That sort of thing can interest me.Fun & twisted isn't exactly a favorite but I did enjoy it. Some spots did touch that nerve where you say to yourself, 'I'm not sure I'll watch that [for the nature of it]...'As far as Dr. Chiba and Paprika... ohhh... (starts to fantasize)"
3,Twisted.....,"Wow...Interesting perspective on dreams. Decent psychological thriller that many will miss because it is animated format. This movie shows you how relatively tame dreams can become down right creepy. I bet you never thought a parade of microwaves, animals, and dolls would give you chills, but by the end of the movie just that music will get you going. Interesting theories about the different dimensions of personality and how some are prevalent during dreams while opposites exist while awake. I did enjoy this movie but I follow that up with What the #$%*? On another note, get the regular version because this animated tale (unlike pixar flicks) offers little improvement in high definition."
2,Couldn't connect at all,"I got this movie in the mail all excited and pumped to watch it...only to be totally unamused. The storyline sounded great to me, but...while watching it the story became FLAT. Things just became ridiculous (not in a sci-fi cool/unique/interesting sorta way). The movie looks and SOUNDS trippy (reading about it before seeing it) and sci fi-ish, but..I didn't get that feel at all....I'm sure other people would enjoy this movie, but I don't recommend it for someone into anime movies or sci-fi. I didn't like the voice overs nor any of the characters."
4,Breathtaking Dream Sequences Compensate for a Tangled Plot,"I'm surprised it didn't occur to me before, but a feature length anime might just be the perfect setting for poking, prodding and exploring the nuances and surreality of a living, breathing dreamscape. And, while it may mask its intentions with an over-complicated storyline and a few underdeveloped supporting characters, it's quite clear that Paprika is really only here to chart those mysterious waters. Without the limitations of a special effects budget or the fear of a not-so-seamless transition between live action and CG, Paprika cuts loose its reservations and opens the doorway to an unbridled imagination. The end result is a continuously shifting, mystifying, perplexing picture that's as gorgeous as it is confusing - and not unlike a wild, vivid dream itself."
5,Paps,Eerily calming and chillingly skin crawling. Reminds me of a dream from waaay bay. Definitley worth owning and watching at 3am. Nice!
2,Disappointing Storyline,"Flawless animation, cool soundtrack, really bad storyline.I was looking forward to Paprika being a great story but was very disappointed. The story writer Yasutaka Tsutui starts out with an intriguing premise but it is never developed into anything interesting or inspiring. The story becomes just another piece belonging to the men's entertainment realm of boring fantasies. Satoshi Kon's brilliant animation talent deserves a better script.On the technical side, the audio on my DVD was almost inaudible at a few points and the faded audio didn't seem part of the storyline."
2,"Simple story, complicated presentation","The story at the beginning seems difficult, like you are wondering where the story is going, like what is all this about. But halfway through to the end you'll see that the real story is actually very simple. I actually felt like it actually wasted time on trying to make the story seem complicated when it's not. Not my favorite. I've seen more exceptional ones. Anyway, loved the blu-ray quality on my PSP."
1,Unimpressed By This Film......,"Unless one is a die hard fan of the anime genre itself, I can't imagine what all the fuss is about with regards to ""Paprika"".Paprika's storyline was NOT very original. This storyline seems to resemble the movies ""The Cell"" starring Jennifer Lopez and ""The Matrix"" trilogy, only ""Paprika"" was done using anime. Based on this assessment, I wasn't very impressed with ""Paprika"".I also felt that watching ""Paprika"" was exactly like watching just another cartoon. I think that perhaps ""Paprika"" would have had more impact if it wasn't an anime, but a regular movie with real actors in it instead."
1,Animated child's cartoon.,"Don't waste your time or money watching this. Animated 80's style cartoon, with brief animated nudity atthe end. Gives you a headache, just watching it."
5,Unique amongst unique,"All i have to say about Paprika is what a wonderful movie it is. It doesn't take long after the movie starts for you to start gasping at how imaginative the movie is. With its focus on dreams the creators had no limit to what they could put in here and it shows. Buy it and watch it, then watch it again, and watch it a couple dozen times after that."
5,An Animation Tour de Force,"Maybe something of a SPOILER at the end.Paprika is fast paced and beautifully animated. At times it is a little difficult to understand, but if you pay attention you should be able to follow along. If you like the previous works of Satoshi Kon then I think you will like this.Best I can describe is that there is a new technology that allows you to share dreams with other people, someone steals the technology, and dreams and reality start to merge. If you were able to follow along with movies like the Matrix this shouldn't be too difficult."
5,A cracker of a Book!,"I wondered how this book would play out after the shocking beginning, but I shouldn't have doubted Peter Lovesey's skill. He writes a great book! His plots and characterizations are wonderful. In this book the curmudgeonly detective Peter Diamond is confronted with a crime that comes too close to home. He is sidelined by the brass for this, the biggest murder case of his career, but he vows that he will use his unique talent to bring his wife's killer to justice. There are more red herrings and leads for him to follow, and we the readers think it's a whole slew of different people, but Lovesey plays it out until the startling conclusion. This is a thickly textured and compelling book, and it is also a watershed book for Diamond. We wonder at the end what kind of man and detective we will have in subsequent stories. This is probably the strongest entry in an already strong series."
3,Good Diamond series entry,"Solid, but the plot has a couple of major logical holes (the killer is supposed to be clever; yet, he/she does some really stupid things), and I agree with the earlier reviewer that the con man character was criminally (hehehe... :-) underdeveloped."
2,Not Sturdy Enough for Us,If you have a gentle cat these will work. We were trying to use these to transport trapped cats for spay/neuter and they could barely contain the cats.Don't think it is the product so much as our intent to use them for a purpose they might not have been intended for.
3,clothes pins,I like these clothes pins... I fell they are a wee bit pricey. Had I been able to find them locally I would not have bought them on line.
3,Not very strong,I bought this product because i wanted clothes pins that would not leave a mark but these are way too soft.. the hold is very weak and would not hold thicker/heavier fabrics.
1,a weak Osprey title,"I'd have to agree with Mr. MacDonald's review. Originally written in 1975, this book is showing its age. The scope is too broad. There is some good basic information here, but the illustrations are abysmal. The interested reader would do well to investigate the other Osprey titles on this period. They are more focussed and therefore of more usefulness. The most egregious error repeated in this book is the mythical prowess given to the longbow. More recent research has debunked this commonly held belief."
4,"Hesitant at first, but was mildly surprised","I have never been a big Cruise fan, but this one was pretty darn good. I think I actually liked it the best out of all the MI movies he did. It has some great funny moments which helped a lot. Thanks to that dude from Sean of the Dead! Tons of great action and minimal love story (thank goodness! coz I can't stand love stories). If you don't buy it, it's definitely worth renting!!!"
4,Ghost Protocol,"A good action film from the series mission impossible. Thou i have most of the series, because i like action movies, mission impossible movies are just ok for me, thou they do have some good action sequences."
2,Boring...,"So when I heard this movie was coming out, my first thought was 'isn't Tom Cruise getting too old for this?' I had no desire to go to the theater to see it or purchase it on DVD. I ended up watching it because a friend rented out of a red-box thing. Anyway, I was bored out of my mind. After the initial action sequence, I passed the time by searching for and downloading new games to my phone to keep me busy. Sure it had action, hence the 2 stars, but the long drawn -out plot was snoozville."
2,Nothing Like the Others,"Boring is the first word that comes to mind after watching this film. The acting is mediocre, the script is so cliche (Russians missile codes and the threat of nuclear war again?! Oye Veigh!) as to make one laugh. It fizzled as quickly as it began. The first three Mission Impossible movies were very good, but clearly the creators of this blaze film did not know when to stop. STOP NOW!"
4,very good film,I really liked this movie great action sequences solid storyline good cast. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the franchise and hasn't seen this yet.
3,Mission Impossible ghost protocol,"Pretty good, the others are better I thought. I only saw about 2/3 of movie..then forgot to watch the rest before my 24 hrs was over.... I will watch again later..."
4,Don't let MI-3 put you off,"After the hyper-serious but I'm not buying it snore-fest of MI-3 you would be forgiven for giving this a miss, but that would be a mistake. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to see past MI-3 and give the franchise another chance, you will be rewarded. Lawrence of Arabia it isn't, but it has rediscovered it's sense of humour, and Tom effectively takes the piss out of the easiest person on the planet to take the piss out of: Tom Cruise. Simon Pegg, much though I love him, is rather stale in his apparently ubiquitous role as comic relief, but none the less, the movie comes across as suprisingly fresh and fun. There is much more of a classic MI ""look, this is ridiculous nonsense but just go with it"" feel to MI-4, and if that is what you are looking for, you will be rewarded. This review will self destruct in, oh no it won't this is the Internet, this review will persist for a long time. Too too long."
2,Someone needs to retire from movies,Movie was Okay and I would not watch again. But after 3 drinks it did start to look better okay .
3,not even close,"Not even close to the original movies. The story line got lost in all the ""action"". The directors seemed to want action rather any type logic."
3,"Good, but I wouldn't buy the DVD","Finally, a nod back to the first movie in the series--Cruise got to be a bit arrogant here, which works for him. This one didn't have quite the cast of the first, nor the surprising good-guy-turns-out-to-be-bad plot, but it did have some cool twists. Why not give the mask to the bad guy, too? And the opening scene with the female assassin reminded me quite a bit of The Sting. Don't want to give away the rest, but the surprises continue, including brief nods to the first and third movies. Perhaps a bit too silly in places, not as good as the first film or Brad Bird's other films, but still worth seeing."
1,Terrible movie. Time for Mission Improbable and Tom Cruise to retire,This movie was by far one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. The plot was ludicrous and the acting (over acting) was terrible. A nuclear missile is flying towards the United States and nothing is done to launch a missile towards the attacker? I paid $8.00 to watch this garbage. First I rented it for download. It never showed up in my movie collection for download. So many people liked it that I went ahead and paid again to stream it online. I wouldn't even recommend it if it were free. I want my money back.
1,lots of action--that is all.,"Acting is poor. Mindless explosions, story is way out there. The last scene is really bad, worst acting in the history of the universe. And I am being kind."
2,Boring,"Cruise is getting too old for this franchise. The action scenes were okay, but too over the top cartoonish. Much prefer the earlier entry's plot structures."
3,Aging well,"This Mission: Impossible is getting kind of old. But I still enjoy it. I fully expect the next movie to include gadgets that allow the geriatric Ethan Hunt to track down the kidnappers of his grandchildren. And I'll watch it and hopefully still enjoy it.Barely makes 3 stars, could have been better with an improved supporting cast that had been expected from the previous movies."
2,Boring,Very disappointed! Nothing at all like the first 3..................MP#3 was pnenominal! Very predictable and did not keep my interest.Some good action scenes but kinda cheezy ones too!
4,Better than the last,"I don't always like Tom Cruises movies but his Mission Impossible movies have been pretty good. If I remember correctly the last one was pretty good and I liked this one even better, It was as always action packed but left you wondering til the end who done it and what was going to happen. A good entertaining movie which I have said many times is why I watch movies. I don't care for real life - I live that daily already."
3,Just Okay,"I expected more from this installment in the Mission Impossible series. It was just *somewhat* entertaining, so I gave it three stars"
1,Don't waste your time,The movie is a boring collection of action sequences connected with shots of Tom Cruise sprinting. The action scenes overwhelmed the plot.
3,"Impossible story, IMF team never gets hurt","This one was over the top. Good stunts. Within the first five minutes, my wife was saying ""this is really bad""."
4,"Lots of Action, Good Story","This movie had lots of action and a good story line. If you liked the other Mission Impossible movies, you'll probably like this one too. That being said, some of the action elements of the movie seemed forced just, action for action's sake."
3,"Diversion, of the viewer and something to do","The plots works at capturing your interest, mostly with technical effects. and generally succeeds. It pleasantly fills some spare time and tries to hook you into the next such movie."
4,Best one of this franchise,I loved this one a lot. This was an 'Edge of your seat' action movie I would watch again and again.
4,Much improved,"They corrected a lot of the MI series issues, like odd looking effects and added some light humor while keeping the interesting plot that makes MI a favorite."
4,Good movie,I think its better then skyfall 007 in my opinion I love all the gadget use in the movie down to action very good watch
3,OK,It was an OK film. Typical Tom Cruise Mission Impossible fare. Lots of action and some comedy in this installment of Mission Impossible Protocol
4,decent flick,Was a fun flick to watch with decent amounts of action. Not my favorite of the series but worth seeing.
5,Keeps you on the edge of your seat,My wife and I enjoyed watching this movie we streamed from Amazon Prime. The movie had a lot of action that kept your attention from the start to finish. I would watch it a second time.
3,It's an Good Movie but not great,"Lots of action, lots of special effects (CGI and compositing). Tom Cruise's acting is typical Tom Cruise - good but not Academy Award winning type performances. Probably the best of the Mission Impossible series of films. Some viewers who are truly deep enthusiasts of the M.I. films will love this release. Myself and other adult family members - find it a good enough movie to watch, but not very memorable. Would I buy it again, probably not."
4,"Bond, Bourne, and Hunt","MI4 is a full-on rollercoaster ride for anyone who is a spy-junkie. The movie is nicely loaded up with plenty of action scenes, from fist fights to car chases. There's also plenty of cool gadgets from the climbing gloves to the mobile command center to the spymobile with the data windshield. Espionage... Intrigue... Good stuff. I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise the person, but his characters always deliver. Ethan Hunt is a super-spy, always thinking on his feet and inspiring his team to push beyond their limitations. From Russia to Dubai, the scope and adrenaline will keep you on the edge of your seat."
3,Mission Impossible - Could Be Better,"If you like special effects, this is definitely for you. AS for the storyline, in my opinion, it doesn't compare with those of the original. The acting is so-so, but in this particular genre that is almost expected. I bought it for my husband and both he and the friends he watched it with loved it, so I would say it is definitely more of a man's movie."
5,The Best Mission Impossible Movie,"This is a fun, entertaining, high powered action movie, great job. I think it's the best of the series by far. I liked every element of the film. Plus it looks and sounds terrific. Buy it."
1,"Jumbled Storyline, Disconnected Dialog and Seems Staged","I found the storyline jumbled, the dialog disconnected and many of the scenes not of nature in the movie seemed very staged.Tom has seen far better days with the likes of Jerry Maguire, Risky Business and Top Gun... This IMF/Mission Impossible franchise needs to go the way of the goonie bird and dinosaurs, it has lived past its shelf life."
1,Even the Action Sequences are Boring,"Look, we all know why we watched this turkey: to see Tom Cruise clinging to the glass sides of the world's tallest building. That's what they used to sell the thing, the rest is just the usual action-movie bag of tricks. Nothing in the screenplay makes the remotest amount of sense. I particularly like the irony of a movie filmed largely in an Arab country - but featuring a Swedish terrorist.This is unquestionably the worst-written, worst-directed, worst-acted and worst-edited film I've seen in years. And as for the sequence of Cruise ""climbing"" the Burj Khalifa, it had all the suspense of watching Jello set. It was patently obvious that the film-makers had build a horizontal facade, so that, rather than climbing, Cruise is actually crawling along the thing, wearing a ridiculous pair of suction gloves.Cruise at least tried to juice the thing up. His co-stars seemed to have drugged themselves in order to dull the pain of delivering their lines."
1,Waste of time,Only the second time I have left a movie theater (Batman and Robbing was the other one) in disgust that I wasted my time and money on this piece of c-rap. Avoid at all costs; you have been warned.
1,Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol,"Once again, a company (Paramount) is using Ultraviolet to screw over the customers. Paramount won't let you actually OWN your digital copy. You can only use it on one computer, and without that, only with streaming wifi. When will Ultraviolet figure out how to get these companies to stop being so greedy? If you want this movie on your Ipad, etc, you have to buy it again somewhere else. Forget that! I'll just watch other companies' movies, such as Universal's. Thanks for nothing Paramount!"
1,effects are pretty pathetic,"Hard to judge it on any other realm.. We all know our expectations for acting or even directing tend to pretty low for ""action"" films.. but if you're not going to even bother spending a little extra time on the effects even on a relatively high budget film like this then what the hell?!!?But judging from many of the other reviews ... I guess all you need to do is spend the budget on good advertising to convince the public that they like what they see."
3,Worth Renting,"Rent this film, if, for no other reason, to support the oh-so-talented Simon Pegg. The movie doesn't break any new ground, but if you need something to do on a slow day, there are worst ways to waste time."
1,Complete waste of time.,"Oh my God, but this was terrible. The plot was silly, the stunts were ridiculous, the dialog was for 4th graders. I would drink poison before sitting thru this monstrosity again."
2,Comic Book Stuff,"This MI film is slightly more credible that the ones before it, but it's still far from believable. The plot, characters, gadgets, and general tone of the film are strictly comic book stuff. Nothing is believable. Still, it's entertaining, if you enjoy comic books. If you're looking for a realistic action film, OTOT, pass this and the rest of the MI series by."
4,Finally; it's Mission Impossible,"If you are a fan of the original TV series, you will be disappointed with MI 1,2, and 3. They were a great deal less of ""Mission Impossible"" and a great deal more of ""James Bond."" However, with MI: Ghost Protocol, the original feel of MI is back. If this is the pattern of the next they could reboot the franchise using this as film one (just toss away the other three or re-name them)."
5,MI MI MI. What a Movie!,"Action, Gadgets, and Story Line. All mixed well together. A fun movie in the MI tradition, and from all appearances, a part of a new trilogy??? I hope."
4,Non Stop Action,"I have really enjoyed this last Mission Impossible movie, Ghost Protocol. I wanted to give it a full 5 Stars.The reason why I did not give it 5 stars is the following:The effort to create a really action packed movie, was achieved. However, to my opinion, they wasted much of their special effects by including a sand storm in the movie, with the result that for several minutes nothing was seen but dust and sand flying around. I guess, I like my movie clean and bright where you can see and enjoy every part of it.Other than that, it is a very nice movie to spend a couple of hours on, munching on popcorn and drinking your favorite soda."
2,Weak,"loved first and third in this series, this one not so much. predictable and ridiculous at times. humor attempts were just that, attempts, and the plot was disjointed. Forgettable."
4,Another good Mission: Impossible film,"Don't get me wrong, I think Tom Cruise is a little bit creepy in real life. As an actor, however, he is passionate about what he does and it shows. It's always cool to see the stunts in this film series and all the gadgets the agents use."
2,Meh,"We were looking for an action movie and at least it filled that need, however, it wasn't a particularly good action movie. The technology was dorky and the story line was confusing and not very compelling. Mission Impossible #1 is still the best of this franchise."
4,Back in action...and in style!,"Any doubts the fans might have had about Tom Cruise being able to carry off another Mission Impossible have been erased (or detonated) after seeing this. A prison break, secret infiltration, comic relief from Simon Pegg and the glitchy equipment, and twists and turns all down the line make this an A+ effort. Plus the tower climbing scene and the little revelations about Ethan's past add to the tension. Well done."
4,Great popcorn movie!,"Loaded with the right combination of action, plot, and laughs to enjoy a night in. You'll even like Tom Cruise."
4,good action,"was very exciting and didn't waste time with rhetoric, also had some humor. Ties in well with the previous movie"
4,Good movie,Its a good movie. I am a fun of the old MI tv series but not much of the new MI movies but I enjoy this one.
3,not great movie but fun to watch,was an ok movie. wasnt the best of the series. did have some decent action scences. it is part of the series that is why i watched it. it was free also
1,Kept rebuffing,Movie kept rebuffing so we quit watching it through amazon. We end up watching on netflex without any problems.Enjoyed the movie. Wish we could of watched it through amazon.
2,It's mission impossible,"Not a fan of the Mission Impossible movies past the first, and yet I still watched this movie. It was a fun action flick, but there are a lot of better movies out there in this genre."
4,For MI Fans,A predictible storyline and spectacular special effects delivery what MI fans come to expect. The supporting cast add more interest to the movie than the Tom Cruise character.
2,exactly what you expcted,I think the movie would have been more believable if it had been animated. Tom has made a ton of movies but is still having trouble with rhe whole acting thing
1,"Movie is great, but UltraViolet is HORRIBLE","I like the movie a lot (hence pre-ordering it on Amazon), but I'm beyond disappointed in the ridiculous UltraViolet digital copy crap that they've started using. I can't import it into iTunes, which means I can't manage whether or not it's on my iPad in any remotely easy way (major fail). Not only that, but when I went to register the disc on Flixster, there isn't even a link available for me to register the disc and download the digital copy. UltraViolet is a poor technology that hasn't been thought out and isn't wanted by the consumers. I want a digital copy that I can do what I want with, not one that the studio is going to tell me how I have to use. Like I said, the movie is great, but UltraViolet is garbage."
1,I WANT MY 3.99 BACK WHAT A TERRIBLE MOVIE,"SAME OLD STUNTS DIFFERENT PLACE, SAME PLOT, NO TWISTS NO BRAINS, THE ACTION WASNT EVEN THAT GOOD, STUPID BACK STORY WITH THE NEW BUDDY CHARACTER, NO SCENES OF EITHER US OR RUSSIAN GOVERNEMENTS WONDERING WHY A MISSLE WAS LAUCHED THE MAIN BAD GUY HAD TWO LINES IN THE WHOLE MOVIE, IT WAS PRETTY MUCH 99% TOM CRUISE CLIMBING TALL OBJECTS AND JUMPING AROUND, THE GADGETS SUCKED TOO, A DEVICE THAT JUST HAPPENS TO MAGICALLY CHANGE HOTEL ROOM NUMBERS, THIS MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY A 5 YEAR OLD....AND PROBABLY WAS"
1,James Bond Rip off at best .,"Nothing will ever make me believe that Tom can do the impossible. He should have been in a wheel chair by now paralyzed. This movie is unbelievably foolish at best and that's putting it nicely. The only interesting character in the film was the woman assassin. And even she didn't have along enough time to save this cliche'. This is a perfect example of what American cinema has been reduced to. To watch someone walk through everything untouched takes suspension of disbelief. The whole car scene was just ridiculous at the end and how he walked out of it. If you want to see a good movie that's unique watch ""DRIVE""."
1,Absolutely terrible.,"This Mission Impossible was the nadir of the series. Previous installments had compelling action sequences, decent acting (see: the last one with Phillip Seymour Hoffman), and a dynamic, interesting story where the characters had at least limited interest.This one has none of these. It was even worse than the over-the-top John Woo-directed installment. Brad Byrd seemed as interested in getting laughs all the way through as in creating a compelling movie. Instead he creates a terrible cheese of a movie with cheap laughs and zero compelling elements.This movie is a joke. Don't waste your money."
1,rip off,What i got from this guy was a dvd version of the movie in a cd case with a blu ray cover on it. What a piece of trash. buyers beware you might get ripped off too
2,Where did the urgency go?,"Someone took a risk and put a lot of humor into this story, but I think it cost the film its sense of danger. I could never really believe that this group of people were involved in something as serious as they wanted me to believe they were."
5,babbs2410,It was well done How ever Sandstorm part was false I have seen them in person like that fast but does get orangeand I have seen Burj up close I felt his pain I like to know where the high tech car came from with screen on windshield realyno distraction
1,Wish there was a zero star rating,"What a steaming pile of garbage. Save your money. This one isn't even worth watching. The first one was good, second was pretty decent, as was the third. This one however was horrible."
4,ghost rocks,great action movie tom cruise does not dissapoint....non stop action...and the storty line from the previous mission impossibles stay intact.
5,MI--06,I have followed all of the MI movies and this one I think was the best..I just couldn't believe a human could climb down the side of that building and get inside thru the window..The ending surely will not be the end and yes I can't wait for MI--07..
5,best of the bunch!,"simple and salient review. just saying.it's got the best little bits from the first 3 movies! you don't need to watch the 3rd movie but if you have this one will have a bit of a bigger impact for you. good writing, good action/ set pieces and solid acting. looks great on blurry btw."
4,The Cruisenator,"Mission: Impossible Ghost ProtocolTom is his own worst enemy when he talks to the press, but give the man a break, he has been giving us good entertainment since 1982 ""Risky Business"", ""Top Gun"", ""Minority Report"", ""MI-1"" and so on. This version of the beloved TV series Mission Impossible does the original show proud. I have seen every TV episode of the original show and Greg Morris, (RIP) went to my high school in Cleveland, OH. No greater tribute can be given to the show than to have Mr. Cruise whip up some fantastic action for fans to enjoy. I won't go into the story and actors and all that, because they were not going for the Academy Award. Action, action, and more action, and that's what we got. Great action flick, the ""T"" man is in top shape for a 50-year old and this is very enjoyable to watch."
3,Déjà vu,Not a bad movie and not very exciting either. But how many movies are based upon the same madman concept. A lot. There is some good acting with the exception of wooden Cruise. For $4 it's okay.
5,Mission Great,One of the best MI movies to date. Good story line and lots and lots of action. Worth waiting for.
2,Hunt; Ethan Hunt. (Que Bond music): Da-dat ..Da-duuuuuu!,"The name's Hunt; Ethan Hunt. So, you're going to launch a Russian nuke at the U.S. to start a nuclear war and change life or Earth. Thank you, Q, for all the tech-toys I will need at the right time. Is that a bad guy with bionic teeth?Cruise should have taken another item from our favorite British agent: How to look cool when you're over 50. I could not take this old man seriously in jeans and a hoodie. Tommy looks too old to wear the clothes of a teenager.Finally, how does our super-agent, who handled dozens of enemy agents across several time zones get his ass kicked at the end by a frumpy, overweight, 65-year-old? Enough was enough at that point. If Cruise is going to take Bond's plot, then to be trained better and dressed properly, Hunt needs to leave IMF for MI6."
3,Really good the first time I watched it...,Then I watched it again and it was just okay. I lost interest mid way but I love Jeremy Renner and that kept me through for the rest of the movie.
5,Fun movie,This movie is the best Tom Cruise movie to come out in a long while. It never takes itself too seriously and yet has the chops of a good action movie.
3,similar to other mission impossible,Was an all right movie. You could guess what would happen next. Probably wouldn't need to watch it again. All right.
5,"No guilt, just pleasure","Intelligent, breath-takingly incredible, beautifully well-done. The best MI movie to date, and we're now looking forward to the next one!"
4,good flick,enjoyed it good flick. nice special effects and story line. would watch again. tc does a good job on these movies.
2,Just OK,Was worth the 1.99 rental to watch during a cross-country plane ride. Glad I didn't see it in the theaters.
4,More of the same...that I like.,"If you liked the other MI's, then you'll like this one. Bigger and more outrageous action that fun too see. I thought the story was engaging and I cared about the characters enough for the action to be exciting."
4,Your Mission If You Choose to Accept It,I've always held the opinion that as an actor Tom Cruise gives a solid performance. His latest Mission: Impossible is no exception. The action is here along with some nifty gadgetry. The scene in the multi-level parking garage is pretty cool too. Expect the unexpected twists and turns that accompany the MI agents and don't forget to buckle your seatbelt.
1,Beyond Stupid and Unbelievable,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.This movie will kill brain cells.The plot is full of holes.Many scenes that are designed to be exciting, just left me saying, ""Yeah right.""A lot of other stuff is just stupid.A twenty-foot wide fan for cooling computers in Mumbai? Please."
3,Ghost Protocol OK,"Entertaining, but not the best of the Mission Impossible flicks. Now that it has been weeks since viewing it, I find that I don't even remember much of the story line."
1,Terrible,The action was great but the story was way too many holes in it. Summing it up. It was a mix bag of action with little thought of the story.
2,Ghost Protocol,The trailer was the best part of this movie - the movie was disappointing - too gimmicky and no real tension. The Dubai portion of the movie was more a travel ad than a key part of the plot.
5,Surround sound?,Great action film and the best of the Tom Cruise series. I was wondering if anyone has a Blu-ray disc that a DTS soundtrack on it? My copy will not play the Dolby TruHD soundtrack. The DTS is not even the MasterHD track. Do I have a defective disc?
5,Bird is the Word,"I was not impressed by 1 or 2. I never saw 3, but we saw this one at the dollar theater and enjoyed it very much. Brad Bird's first live action movie. You can really feel the danger, even in 2-D. Proprioception, I think is the word."
1,Go outside and mow the lawn instead,"You'll find more invigorating excitement mowing the lawn. Hollywood has lost touch, I just can't get into the same old story rehashed over and over and over and over."
1,YOUR WEBSITE WON'T LET ME DOWNLOAD TO MY TIVO,WHO DO I CONTACT TO MAKE THIS WORK?? I'VE TRIED AND TRIED BUT ALL YOU WANT TO HELP ME WITH IS HOW TO DOWNLOAD TO MY KINDLE FIRE. I DON'T OWN ONE!!!
1,Could not watch because o9f audio track off on last two movies I watched This is for MI-Ghost Protocol and Expandibles2,"I rented this movie to watch on my new computer from Amazon and it did not play properly, the audio track was off I could only take ten minutes of lip movement waiting for the voice to come after the lips move or before, etc. Calling Amazon and being put on hold twice and disconnected while on hold, and waiting for 10 minutes or more for help I gave up so I rate this film as lousy since I did not get to watch it. Same thing happened a week or so before when I watched Expendables 2 and it had the same problem. IT seems more and more of recorded messages and the time that takes to talk to someone is ridiculous for companies who make millions and billions each year that they cannot afford to hire enough people to make you want to buy anything from them. John W. Allen"
2,I already watched this movie.,The Mission Impossible movie franchise isn't fresh anymore. The first two movies were great but the follow up films are just old and tired and boring.
2,Couldn't Even Finish It,"I gave it a couple of stars, just because I actually like the MI flicks, and they kind of grew on me, so after reading the critics, I figure it was worth a shot...but it all seemed like 'play-acting' and suspension of disbelief for all the stuff they did was a little much. I mean, they should have made it more cerebral and less physical, but the seemed to have gone in the opposite direction, like they would with a *rising* action star, and not Tom Cruise.I won't go into details: I sat down, ready to enjoy a movie, and got more and more bored. Finally couldn't watch anymore. TC needs to go back to acting school, and learn another way to seem 'angry' other than just lowering his head and looking up at his opponent...I'm so sick of that little 'move' of his which he started in MI1, and I guess somebody liked...anyway, no good."
3,mabey na,not the greatest movie ever but it had a few moments! however the moments were not worth renting tom cruize is a bit to uneventful for me. maby next time
4,Liked it!,Watched this movie on an airline flight and it kept my attention well and enjoyed watching it. Definitely worth the money and worth the time to watch.
4,Tom Cruise was Great,"Lot's of adventure, suspense. Great movie. I would recommend people to buy this for there collection of Mission Impossible. Tom Cruise is really the new James Bond."
2,Tired Plot; Good Ensemble,"For an MI episode the plot was right out of a Steven Segal movie from 1996. As Maxwell Smart might say ""the old steal the nukes from the former Soviet Union"" scenario.If you ignore that the main premise has totally been done a gazillion times the action, thrills and cast interaction keep your attention.One thing lacking was the jaw dropping final chase sequence, but the actors somehow made up for it. This almost might make a better TV series than a movie franchise if you could get them to reprise their roles on the small screen."
2,"THE ALMOST ""IMPOSSIBLE MISSION""...STAYING AWAKE DURING THIS FILM !","The first ""Mission Impossible"" feature film was excellent. Solid cast, good script, and, it worked. The next two features were only fair, so I was hoping ""Ghost Protocol"" would get the franchise back-on-track. But, i was truly disappointed.The script needed better focus, the entire production was about 10-15 minutes too long, and the cast was only so-so. Cruise's nod to ""being hip"" & ""current"" with his ""hoodie"" image was/is really a stretch ! Could have done without that for sure.All-in-all, outside of a few special effects, ""Ghost Protocol"" was a film that I hoped would pick-up-speed, get focused, or, just plain get to the good part of the script...but, alas, that was not to be.Confusing, disjointed, only mildly entertaining...and w-a-y too long. (Spoiler alert: The ""chase"" sequence during the sandstorm could have been shortened by about 2 minutes and might have been good. As it was, I kept waiting for it to be over !)"
4,Happy Arrival,"I bought my brother the first 3 movies and then another. The 4th movie I got him, he already owned. So I got him this instead. It arrived in a reasonable amount of time with no issues."
3,"Entertaining, but nothing special","It's always amusing to see brands show off their products in movies. For Ghost Protocol, BMW took center stage with their X5, 6 series, and upcoming i5 electric vehicle. Dubai's Burj Khalifa was also showcased with an extramural climb by TC, but it didn't actually give a full sense of the building's height. The story itself was depressing even though the feeling of global devastation wasn't conveyed very well. Overall, the movie had some good action sequences and some entertaining comic relief...especially when Hunt and Brandt were trying to board the boxcar."
1,Can't know if I like it or not,"This movie was looking pretty good but about half way throught the movie it got all choppy, then it froze. It tried to come back a bunch of times but finally I gave up and just stopped watching it."
4,Good but not great,"I was entertained for 2 hours, but I won't be adding it to my permanent collection. Tom cruise is still a good actor even if a bit crazy."
3,It's ok!,"I liked the action but I didn't think that it was the best in the series, but at least it was better than MI III"
3,Just your standard series continuation film,Didn't like the plot that much compared to past MI films. Special effects and setting were a bit contrived as well. Just an average action film. Expected a bit more from the budget and franchise.
3,Save your money,Too many shootings and no interaction between the charactors. I thought Tom Cruise was a lot better in Knight and Day.
3,A bit cheesy,I found the movie a bit cheesy and far fetched. It was very hard for me to get into it.
4,Not too bad,"Good action as always. Stunts weren't too ridiculous for the most part, and enjoyed seeing Simon Pegg have a bigger role."
3,Good but not great,It is your typical one man army saving the world from disaster. Although I did like some of the special effects.
4,I Liked It,It kept my attention through out the whole movie. Some great stunts. A lot of action. A pretty good plot.
4,Mission Impossible--liking Tom Cruise,"Not a fan of Tom Cruise or the prior Mission Impossible movies. Actually rented this one because of Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg. While I still don't care for Cruise after watching Ghost Protocol, Pegg added some lightness and humor to the script, and Renner put another good humored tough guy into the mix. Oh, and I'm a fan of the director Brad Bird, who directed Iron Giant and The Incredibles. The action sequences were breathtaking. As the star, of course Cruise is going to do most of the awesome stunts, and him crawling up the side of a building, and fighting the bad guy in a parking garage had me holding my breath. If there is another Mission Impossible movie with the same actors and director, I would watch it."
4,great movie,I love this movie. But the DVD was used and had a lot of scratches which made the movie stall.
4,Solid action,I gave it 4 stars because it had some really memorable action scenes but it dragged a little in parts. It's an overall good movie night pick though.
4,Tom Terrific Scores,This is the franchise's best movie. The cast has great chemistry. The movie was brilliantly directed and acted. There aren't many movies that I can watch more than once; this is a keeper and one I love to watch again and again.
5,Perfect Action Flick,"I couldn't resist getting this for $10. I'm not a fan of Tom Cruz, but I am a fan of this movie. Perfect mindless action film that keeps you going. I loved it! One of my favorite movies from last year!"
3,Story line not the best,"The action scenes are what make it, and of course Jane Paula Patton. Let's see more of her in action roles. While I like Simon Peggy in comedy roles, I think this is ill suited casting. Goofiness doesn't add to the plot or the character"
5,Great movie!,This movie is great! Action packed and exciting until the end. Loved in the theater and love on bluray. A movie I can watch more than one or sure
4,Great For Teens/Parents,"Ghost Protocol is a great movie choice for parents if your kids have grown past films like The Lion King and Ice Age, but are still too young for anything R-rated. With its mature storyline and action-packed footage, Ghost Protocol has an R-rated feel, but without the excessive sexual content and bad language that accompanies true R-rated movies. It's a great compromise for parents and those teens who're in a hurry to grow up.My only negative comment about the movie is that a couple of scenes are difficult to follow due to the mixture of action and dialogue."
1,Horrible B grade movie,Tom should be totally embarrassed by this production! I want my money back! It was horrible! It looks like they shot this movie with an iPad! Cheap!
1,POOP,That's all I can say about Tom Cruise and this joke of a movie a piece of poop like him and the movie!!!
2,Save your money,"Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is a terrible movie. The plot is a joke. The studio appears to have locked five writers in five different rooms and told them to write a scene based on a city. The scenes were then stiched together with a totally implausible plot. At the end, Tom Cruise's character can't even beat up an old white guy in a colonel sanders suit. Terrible, terrible movie."
2,I just kept waiting ...and waiting ...and waiting,"Sorry folks. This DVD was pretty much a waste for me. It was simply....not engaging and even boring.You have to credit Tom Cruise. He is no doubt a fine actor and a Guy who deservedly can be proud of his physical conditioning. But, that just could not save this movie.Jeremy Renner was utilized poorly. The movies stunts were sometimes laughable.All in all ...I would save my money. Unless of course you want the movies you watch to have all the great reality and suspense of a poor reality TV show.What is most dismaying, is that with just a bit less over the top unbelievable stunts and a bit more real character development..it might have been a fine movie."
2,Digital Copy is CRAP,"I really like the movie. However, the Ultraviolent digital copy process is ridiculous! Too many steps to download. Can only play through the Paramount manager, which must be downloaded as well. Can't find the movie file on my computer. Will not play through iTunes nor will it play on a mobile device unless that device is connected to the web and the movie streamed from Paramount.In the future, I'll boycott all Paramount blu-ray releases and only purchase HD versions of movies through iTunes."
1,can not play in HD via amazon website.,"Since i can not play this in HD via the website, I am giving it a one star review. Don't start getting all greedy now amazon, its not like you!!!"
1,Not a good movie,This movie is not very good. I guess it's ok if you like Tom Cruise as much as Tom Cruise does. He's on screen probably 90% of the time.
2,caricature,"How sad. They took a great concept/series and reduced it to a caricature. Bad script, bad directing, over the top, unbelievable, and just plain stupid. Don't waste your money. I wish Amazon would give you a refund in these cases. I paid for this, and quite frankly, will only finish the movie because I did."
4,Awesome Movie!,"Fantastic effects, beautiful scenery and exotic places. You didn't have to think as much as you did in the first MI but still it was very entertaining and I'd watch it again."
4,Great action!,The movie was good and had plenty of action scenes. The idea was somewhat far fetched but seems to be the norm lately.
3,Five Star movie - minus two for Ultraviolet,"Great movie. Good cast, fast paced, great locations and excellent action scenes.The extras were definitely a value add to the product. The extra on filming on the side of the Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai was amazing!Minus two stars for the misleading copy on the product packaging.It does not contain a digital copy or the ability to get a digital copy in an industry supported format.Instead it has a redemption code for the Ultraviolet streaming service.The service is poorly implemented really shouldn't have been released to the public with the issues it still has.The inclusion of ""Ultraviolet"" support for this product is not value add to the consumer."
4,Bird spreads wings with live action,"As I expected with Brad Bird directing, MI:GP is well and carefully constructed. It's fast paced but unrushed. The characters are distinct; their interactions fun and credible. The action is intense, the stakes are high, and the whole thing is leavened with a good amount of humor. And some of the stuff Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt suffers caused me to wince and cringe in sympathetic pain.I'd quibble in a couple of places: not a fan of the title sequence that basically previews the movie, and Ethan Hunt falls off of things just one too many times prompting my daughter and I both to laugh where that was obviously not the intended response. Still, a respectable action flick and an interesting addition to animation director Brad Bird's resume."
4,Predictable,Ok but time to retire this saga . I would like to recommend but it's totally up to your taste.
5,Relaxing and enjoyable,"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a good movie to watch on a relaxing Friday night. It does not have too much action that it becomes overwhelming. Humor also breaks the tension of most serious scenes. I enjoyed it from start to finish, and thought it was an improvement from MI3, which I found not very interesting due to its usage of a lot of already existing ideas that have been used in previous movies. I would watch it again."
4,Ghost Protocol Does Not Disappoint,"While the story left a little bit to be desired here and there, overall, the latest Mission Impossible is very entertaining. The scenery is great wherever the agents must travel, the action is non-stop, and the technology is all very cool. I went in expecting the Mission Impossible series to end with a dud but I'm more hooked than ever now."
3,ghost protocol,It was ok. Pretty much the same o'l thing. I found it entertaining but on a slow pace. I would recommend it.
4,Best Mission Yet!,"Finally, an M:I movie that doesn't take itself so seriously. Although the premise is not a humorous one (global destruction), the movie itself and the cast seem more lighthearted thus making it less dark and serious. Simon Pegg pretty much gives any movie he's in a shot in the arm, and Jeremy Renner's acting chops fit in well with the rest of the cast.Sorry we didn't get to see Ving until the end, though. All in all a pretty good flick and the blu ray looks pretty freaking awesome ( especially the shots of Dubai)."
3,Just Good!,"I felt that this MI did not live up to the other's.The movie just was missing something,maybe because it seemed to drag from action to action!I realy enjoyed the last three sequels.The stunts were breathtaking, leaveing you on the edge.MI-4 may have been just one to many sequels,it wasn't bad but it sure wasn't great!"
5,another good movie,I like it and the video quality is very good so get this one! Don't forget the popcorn and soda :-)
3,Another T.C. Movie.,This is your typical action movie. It's the same as the other MI movies in my opinion but I'm glad I saw it.
2,Mangled Gift,"I purchased this as a gift and was pretty disappointed. Upon receiving it the movie case was disfigured and the cover was rippling and bulging in places. I didn't have time to return it before I gifted it (bad on my part), but if it won't play for my friend, it will be returned."
3,It's okay,"Tom Cruise was a lot more than I expected and would have given it a higher rating except a few days later I watched the recent 007 films, Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. They pale in comparison. The photography, the writing, the acting and so forth are all far better in the Bond films. That said I enjoyed Ghost Protocol too. It ran at a faster pace. Had an interesting story. It's an adventure film which runs from scene to scene until the climax. I've watched it several times. Nevertheless it's not a gripping film like Casono Royale with Daniel Craig and Judy Dench which commands your attention from start to finish. Ghost Protocol is the best of the Mission Impossible he series. People were quite right. The films got better as the series continued. Great second hand buy."
3,"Decent movie, not the best but not the worst.","The movie was not bad. Worth renting, not buying. There is decent action but it's not like a Borne movie or something."
3,Just Okay!,"This movie is average at best--not one of the better mission impossible offerings with Cruise. The action is good, with breath-taking, unbelievable stunts that almost make you forget that the plot is weak. I'm was surprised they put Paula Patton in a role that called for more sex appeal and edginess. Patton always comes across as a nonagressive, good-girl type and very boring. Zoe Saldana would have been perfect for the role."
4,things go wrong for Ethan Hunt and the IMF,"best of the series. - most real, grittier, I think!A movie where, for a change, everything goes wrong again and again for Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and the ousted, disgraced, Impossible Mission Force for most of the movie but they win in the end, nevertheless.Much more teamwork than previous movies. Contains spectacular shots Tom Cruise hanging outside of the highest building in the world. This shots are done without blue screen, without a stunt double. Cruise said on Jay Leno he trained for 6 months to be able to climb up and repel down this Dubai tower.Done with much less special effects than you might suppose.I have seen this movie twice now, and it IS really the best action movie of the last year, IMHO. When al the other movies with blue screen are forgotten, this will be remembered."
1,"Worst MI, by far","Just thought this was all-around terrible - action scenes were OK, but the story had a number of cheesy turns and a dismal plot. Maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind for it, but I am very glad that I didn't see this at the theater."
4,Protocol,"I just watched this movie its worth watching from start to end. From the squeals I am not fond of the first one but second,third, also fourth are worth it. I did not see it in blue-ray."
1,Flash bang boring - don't bother,"This is just another big-budget movie with not much real creative thought. The story is preposterous, the characters completely hollow and it just leaves you wondering what happened?It's like ordering a birthday cake made of sponge rubber and covered in frosting.It seems that Hollywood can rake in the cash without having to actually build a storyline that hangs together - even a little bit.2 hours wasted."
1,Not about the movie/About the service,"Not providing review for movie. Service disrupted continually over 24 hours. I could not even finish the movie in time. I like Amazon. I have a Logitech Revue, and Comcast high speed cable. There are so many things that can go wrong with downloads, links in the chain, but I don't have this bad a problem with any other services."
2,Rather watch 007,"I recently started watching this movie wondering why I hadn't seen it yet. Answer, I had and it was just forgetable to me. Needless to say i didn't finish it once I realized I was bored again!"
2,didn't finish watcing it...,the connection was inadequeateit went from HD to lower quality to enable viewingbut it kept stallingso i quit watching :(
2,MISSION IMPOSSIBLE GHOST PROTOCOL FOR DUMMIES,"This movie is so phony, it's an insult to one's intelligence. The special effects are greast! Its appeal isin the action scenes that can only appeal t morons."
3,Its an action flick.,This is your standard over the top action flick no more no less.I would recommend this if you want a slower passed action flick with poor acting to help you pass the time.
4,what you'd expect,"a fun action film, that didn't require having to use my brain! lol!worth the watch...nice film footage too. enjoy!"
4,better than the last,If you are a fan of Mission Impossible you will want to see this. It had great special effects and it needs yo be seen on a HD television.
3,Light entertainment,Pretty amazing stunts -- just wish they would also consider including some of the laws of physics!Some tings they do are definitely IMPOSSIBLE!
3,Was pretty good. Had a decent story and good mix of action.,Was a pretty good. Had a decent story and good mix of action. One of the better Mission Impossible movies.
4,lots of action!,"It moved quickly and kept my attention, but I'm a romantic and would have liked to see him and wife at end together."
4,Nice movie,"Nice script, just like the other MI movies in the past, acting is ok, but the draw here are the action sequences and the plot"
2,2hr 12min Apple & BMW commercial,Just watched Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol and the Apple and BMW product placement couldn't have looked more out of place if they tried. I want to like Ghost Protocol but it's so rife with product placement that it's basically unbearable.
2,Mission Impossible--Ghost Protocol,I have enjoyed the other MI movies but this one relies too much on special effects while the story takes a back seat.
4,another Cruise hit,I have enjoyed all of the Mission Impossible films and this one did not disappoiint. It is one that I would see again
4,The best of the MI movie series,"I don't need to add much to all the reviews here. I just want to say that, in my opinion, this is the best movie of the MI series, staying truest to the original tv series. The story is complex, intriguing and very taut. The action is fast-paced and sufficiently used, without overpowering the story flow (whereas with MI 2, the action sequences overshadowed the story). There is even some lighthearted wit and humor interwoven into the intense drama and thriller of the story. A second best in this series would be MI 3, which also stayed true to the series' integrity. The first MI movie (with Jon Voight) is good, but lacks the cohesive structure of its sequals. I think these movies get better with each attempt and new story. I hope they plan to make a fifth MI movie."
3,Just OK,"If you like action, Ghost Protocol is OK. Unfortuantely, Amazon doesn't have many streaming titles. So you're kind of stuck with this. I used to have a Blockbuster a few blocks away from me. The key is ""used to"". That's why I watched Ghost Protocol"
3,MI:GP,"Overall okay movie, some of the stunts and gadgets were too over the top even for MI. Felt like they were really reaching to bring the movie together, MI:1 is the best. Glad I waited for the video."
2,Decent at Best,I had high hopes for this movie. I did not get to see it in the movie theaters when it came out in Dec 2012. The reviews were great and I did like the 3rd movie that was made in 2006. But with all the positive reviews this movie got I expected this to be the best one but it was NOT. I like Tom Cruise and love a lot of his films. When he had that whole backlash thing I thought people were being dumb. But I was BORED. And even if I felt some action scenes were good and creative I kind of felt that I have seen this all before. I would say the only reason to see this is if you liked the other movies and do not care if you are seeing the same old thing again and again. I think this should be the last Mission Impossible film but with it's big box office I do not think it will be.
1,fell asleep ...,"This movie could not keep my mind engaged, so the action becomes meaningless.Cerebral juices lulled. Most movies keep me awake ... i fell sleep."
3,Fell asleep...,"Fell asleep...didn't keep my interest very long. Or I was super tired....Nah, it didn't keep my interest very long...OK one more word..."
3,Ok,Typical MI movie. Tom Cruise is his usual self in this movie. I will pass on the next iteration of this series.
2,So disappointed!,"Don't get me wrong--I love the movie. It's a lot of fun to watch, which is why I bought this version, which advertised digital copy. My kids are going on a road trip in a couple weeks, and I thought this would be great for them to watch on our Android tablet. I don't even own a Blu-ray player, so the ONLY reason for the purchase was digital copy.We've all seen digital copy advertised on TV. The commercials make a big deal about how you can watch a movie on your PC, TV, and portable devices. Unfortunately, when I transferred this film to my Android tablet, some kind of copy protect prevents it from playing. Not being very tablet-savvy, I'm kind of at a loss.I was going to buy a whole bunch of digital copy movies for my kids' trip, but now it looks like I'll have to find another way to keep them entertained for three weeks in the car.This is the first Amazon purchase I'm seriously disappointed in. :-("
2,Snore.,"After all this time, I would think that this series of movies would get more exciting instead of less. It's like they sleep-walked through it: same old thing. Boring plot, less intrigue, blasé acting. Isn't this supposed to be a thriller?"
3,Pretty Good,"Mission impossible movies are typically very smart, action packed, with a good plot. This one seems a little bit too self-aware. It knows it is a mission impossible movie, and instead of sticking with the same old formula, it became a gadget movie. Too many unrealistic high tech devices that played important parts in the story. All-in-all, it is entertaining and worth watching, it just has a few too many wholes."
3,Nothing Special,"This was an 'okay' movie...nothing special about it. The so-called 'Special Effects' weren't even that special. Climbing (and almost slipping) while hanging from the outside of a tall building...so overdone. Watching Tom Cruise do it, didn't make it any better...no matter how tall the building was supposed to be.The characters were boring and the storyline contrived. I actually found myself rooting for the far more interesting Bad Girl. The ending was oh-so predictable. Again, nothing special here.So, if you have nothing better to do and have some time to kill...go ahead, watch this movie. Just don't expect anything special."
3,Mission UnBelievable,"Ghost Protocol is another in the series of U.S. government covert action films proving why Hollywood loves a villain. In this film, everyone we meet cannot be trusted, even the good guys. If explosions, mixed martial arts fighting and fast cars keep you on the edge of your movie seat, then this film is for you."
1,Weak premise and unbelievable even for an action movie,Bad guy walks away from a head on collision??The story is not credible. The bad guy is either super human or there is a sub plot about secret human testing that I missed. It was a major distraction.
2,Not good,Cruise should hang it up and find a new bimboAnd help raise his children and quit ScientologyGood for Katie Holmes for running away and saving her child
5,Great Movie,"Even though this movie seemed pretty short compared to the previous movies, I'm glad to finally have it in my collection. THis was actually the first...and LAST movie I ever saw in IMAX. IMAX is such a waste of money...seriously. I'll stick with a regular movie."
2,Brad Bird is slumming,"Hopelessly silly plot, poor special effects. Paula Patton is the only bright spot. Tom Cruise looks ridiculous most of the time. Why is the entire movie less exciting than a single episode of ABC's ""Missing?"" Get back to animation, Brad Bird. We need you."
5,Brad Bird is a Natural,"In his short career I want to share that if he is not THE BEST he is one of the most talented of the modern breed of ACTION Directors. He shows with this addition the versatility to run a diversity of genres. I went with my wife to watch the advance screen of this movie on IMAX. And we have a remarkable experience pack with tons of gadgets, stunts and a very talented cast. For the rookies to this movie franchise they wont be disappointed or clueless. For the M. I. experienced audience this will achieve and maybe impress, I WAS!, for the multi sequences full of action, stress, and laughs too. In these struggling economic times + struggling lack of entertaining movies, I will highly recommend M.I. GHOST PROTOCOL, if is in IMAX it will add a lot to your experience. As in Dark Knight: IMAX, all the high action sequences of Ghost Protocol are in FULL IMAX! THANK YOU BRAD, TOM, JJ and THE IMPRESSIVE CAST and CREW for this experience!!!"
5,Great action drama,Tom Cruise is in great form and totally believable as the action hero. The direction and cinematography is superb. This is by far the best feature in the franchise.
4,"Fun show, kept the franchise moving much to my surprise","Enjoyable show, Tom Cruise thinks highly of himself of course, and it's movies like this that just may give him reason so to believe... Worth watching if you enjoy the other Mission Impossible flicks!"
3,It was not the best but not the worst either,This Mission Impossible was an entertaining movie. I would recommend that people watch it at least once but not buy it unless they have urge they need fulfilled.
4,very fun,action packed so if you liek that you will like this. The team is so good together. Great rental movie.
5,"Pretty good movie, fast paced",I'm pretty sure I caught all of the irony & smart aleck comments in this movie because I laughed the whole time!!!
3,"Not bad, but not great.","I had heard great things about this movie, and that it blew away all the previous Mission Impossible movies. Unfortunately, I think that was just a lot of hype that was spread around to attempt to revive Tom Cruises' career. The movie was okay, but definitely not the best of the series."
4,Running along the edge where the unlikely meets high-performance reality,"At times this next ""mission"" of the franchise leaves me breathless and heart pounding. I have never base-jumped, and can only imagine the blended terror and thrill; but the long, action filled scenes and split-second timing works as all of us have come to expect from Ethan and his team. As the action unfolds, the plot reveals itself grudgingly. Every time I anticipated the next factoid to zoom into focus, a twist of fate intervened. Great entertainment!"
4,Good effort,Was worth the watch for the special effects alone Iam not a Tom Cruise Fan but the movie was good enough to keep my interest at least
4,Action,There is lots of action but that is expected if you seem the previous Mission Impossible movies. There really isn't anything special. Tom Cruise is solid in his role.
4,MI-ghost protocol,This movie was enjoyable but I don't think that it compares to the first couple that were made. If you just enjoy the action you will like it. It's worth watching.
3,"Action, action and more action!","Non-stop and sometimes incredulous action! Good movie but some of the stunts were a little far-fetched. Too much ""just in the nick of time"" stuff."
3,No quite the same standard,The story line wasn't up to the same standard as the previous movies in the series but still worth seeing and owning.
3,"It's entertaining actions, but ...","a lot of it makes no sense. I don't want to give too much away, but characters have nifty gadgets, which are technically impossible (but it IS Mission IMPOSSIBLE, so ...) but then aren't wearing body armor into the potentially dangerous situation, or they take actions that turn out to be unnecessary. You don't think about the inconsistencies while you're watching it, but it leaves a bitter aftertaste that a little better writing/producing could have avoided. I think I had higher expectations due to JJ Abrams involvement."
5,Best One so far of this Series,"Of course the tools and gadgets are far fetched, or are they? Hmmmn Makes you wonder what you don't know won't hurt you. Bar none the best so far."
5,Great Movie!,"This is such a great movie! A perfect blend of comedy and action, making it entertaining for everyone! I would definitely recommend this to others!"
4,Good if not taken too seriously,"This movie adds a lot more comedy than the other Mission Impossible movies. It's lighthearted tone allows you to enjoy the movie a little more. The others in the series are so far fetched, it's hard to believe any of it. The laughs in this one distract from how unrealistic it all is. I thought it helped the flow and added more depth."
5,Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol {HD},It was a good movie. Tom is my man! HD is the only way to watch a movie like this!
3,Just another movie,Failed to capture the audience in my opinion. Weak plot! The only thing holding it together are some of the action scenes.
4,Cool Movie which holds together pretty well,It still doesn't have the impact as James Bond or the original Mission Impossible but is a fun movie to watch.
4,Mission Impposible,"Love the Mission Impposible franchise,Tom Cruise is fantastic in this role. Hopefully he will continue churning them out yearly till he,s 98"
3,Good but not as Good,"We have seen all of the Mission Impossibles and although this was in the running, it was a little too 'out there' even by MI standards. Still interesting and exciting."
4,Pass the torch,"Agent Ethan Hunt must take his mission impossible team to save the world again. Only this time there is no support beside each other! As good as the rest, a fun ride."
2,"Movie OK, download time unacceptable","We enjoyed the movie well enough, but the download to our Tivo box took well over three hours. We ordered the movie and then had to wait until the next night to watch it. Not good."
2,Predictable but entertaining,"Add to Tom Cruise's coffers if you must. One way or another, Suri will benefit and you'll get an hour and a half of cheap thrills."
5,Tons of Production Power,"Nice. Too the point. Moves along at an optimal clip.Hats off to them all. The side-kick lady did well, but, should havebeen a better ""pick""--more beautious!! As in the all-star james bond types of the past--non-minoritous.Overall, Labor-intensive to the max. Enjoyable.5 star absolutely!"
2,blah blah blah,too corny.. too many buddy scenes.. it was a big yawn. action scenes were neat not enough to carry the mushy bull crap.
2,Subjective,"My wife enjoyed this movie much more than I did. There aren't any real faults I can complain about but, to me, the strength of a movie like this is tension and suspense, but because so much of this movie is rehash and cliche, there isn't any tension or suspense."
5,The best Mission Impossible movie yet,"I really, really enjoyed this film. My heart was pounding during the tower scene. I thought I would come unglued. Definitely the best Mission Impossible yet."
4,Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol Blue Ray,"Excellent Movie. Great special effects spectacular scenery . When they show the tallest building in the world and the camera pans downward, it gave me goose bumps..fear of heights!!"
2,Sadly exhausted,"They've run this franchise into the ground. Over produced, over complex, boring... Even through all the action. Go back and watch MI 1 or 2 again. This one is the death knell."
1,Disavowed again....,"How many times can a man be disavowed by his employer and still come back to work for them? I found myself more concerned with Ethan Hawk's 401K then anything else. Did he roll it over after being disavowed? Did he have to pay the 10% penalty? His CPA's head must be swimming with the constant being fired and rehired. Crap, I hope his health insurance didn't lapse either. By the way, the movie sucks. Cruise ran around, climbed buildings, drove cars fast and got the bad guy. Boring and nothing new at all."
2,Don't Rent Or Buy HD from Amazon its a RIPOFF!!!,"I'd like to rate the Movie but AMAZON IS NOT CAPABLE OF STREAMING HD!!!! Rented this movie in HD and like always cut out several times and they blame my bandwidth even though I get 20 mbs and even tested my conection. AMAZON if you can't support streamin in HD then stop conning people into renting or buying HD movies from you, just tell it like it is and only offer what you can provide which is SD!!! By the way, the parts of the movie that I did watch, but after getting cut off so many times I was simply too P.O.'d to enjoy it."
2,Worst of series,"This is the worst of the MI series. Jeremy Renner is a nice addition and hope he is in any future movies. Ving and Michelle only appear in the last few minutes of the movie and seemed to be thrown in for die hard fans of the series. Do not waste your money, watch it on Netflix if you have it."
4,Mission Impossible combo pack - good deal,"Recently got into Blu-Ray ... It's great that you get Blu-Ray, reg DVD and a digital version all in one pkg."
5,Great Movie,I ordered this movie since I've seen all the previous MI movies. Sat in my living room with amenities and watched a great movie from beginning to end with the action scenes taking my breath away.
4,So you're wondering what's this edition with the yellow border...,"When the impressive sequel ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" got released on DVD, the version that got a wide release had that crummy Ultraviolent streaming extra feature and retailed for $19.99. As a Wal-Mart exclusive, Paramount also released an version without Ultraviolent stream extra with a retail price of $14.99. This version contains a yellow/goldish border around the front cover. That's the only difference. If you can live without the Ultraviolent extra and the ugly yellow border then this edition is well worth the discounted price."
3,Thrill a minute action...,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable action flick with great gadgets, car chases, good fight scenes and Tom Cruise who's not taking himself too seriously. But gee, he beefed up for this movie, photoshopped perhaps?Yes, if you enjoy this type of movie, you've probably seen it all before including a nuclear threat on America. But it was fun, and very easy to watch.And it's set up for number 5 which surprised me."
3,"Worth $1.00 - for the ""fun""","I don't watch many movies over a year's time. Two to five rentals tops. I don't watch movies such as ""Mission: Impossible"" for a storyline or other such nonsense. I watch a movie to get away from reality for a few hours and just see something that I could never afford to make. I always look for value - and this movie gave me incredible value. I was entertained - period. Multi-$$$ sets, interesting camerawork, a new take on the theme song, take a trip to enemy soil in Dubai (where people hate us and our traditional yankee values - that I'll never give up ), and watch Tom Cruise wrinkle up like a prune as he ages. Definitely worth $1.00 (which came out of my wife's wallet).If I want storyline and reality, I just have to turn off the computer, pack up the DVD, and get on with my life."
2,Little Ole' Cookbook,"This is an antique cookbook with a bit of information on several appliances. The book is terribly dated and not very useful.On the other hand, it is fun to see what we were cooking several years ago."
5,amazing,"When I ordered this book, I wasn't sure it would be what I wanted. It's quite amazing and very interesting. I love cats and wanted to learn all about how their bodies work. Most books give only some info regarding this but this book gives all that I wanted."
5,Excellent book for future graphic designers,I actually took a couple of classes by John T. Drew (author) and by some of the other people who wrote articles in this book and the other two volumes. This book gives step by step instructions on how to come up with ideas for projects and is great for those who need help with the process part of design. I would definitely recommend this book and the other 2 volumes for future graphic designers. Also for those who get the opportunity try to take a class with John Drew because he really knows what he's talking about.
2,This book is not clear.,"He tries to simplify the math. Result: Unclear explanations.He mentions Markowitz allocation and says that the portfolio projected using historical parameters did poorly. Then what do you do? His equal part allocation?He apparently strongly support indexing based on poor mutual fund performance. Later he says the title of the book is in honor of Benjamin Graham. Graham is famous because of his methodology to choose stocks based on fundamentals. So what? Indexing or stock picking?Frankly, I found the book a bit confuse because he did not clearly answer the above questions."
3,"Interesting, but ...","This book of William Bernstein is really interesting, but...should be ""addressed"" to people that is much into number analysis, statistics and so on; I mean that the concepts are interesting, but the way Bernstein writes is full of numbers, diagrams etc.; I found this book a little bit ""too scientific"" for my taste...!"
1,"Oversimplified, and inaccurate","I bought this book because of the intriguing title. I was very disappointed upon reading it, and would suggest it should be retitled, The unintelligent asset allocator. I would not use the material in this book to build a portfolio for any of my clients."
5,smart advice,"Smart, direct, and to the point. WB wastes no time describing to the reader his approach and the statistics that support it. For those of the math-inclined a very nice book on investing. It's powerful when an investment advisor backs what he/she says with data - a rare thing in today's world of financial guessing."
3,This book if for Mathematicians!,"Okay - this book appeared on some list on Amazon as one of the ""Top 10"" asset allocation books. I think the author is very intelligent and knows what he is writing about BUT warning - this is not a book for anyone who is not good with statistics and numbers. I feel that I have average intelligence and I think I understand the overall points of Bernstein's book. However, it reads like some statistical theorem - very esoteric. I found it dull and very laborious to get through. Painful and some parts barely understandable - written for mathematicians and statisticians! If you want the same message but MORE UNDERSTANDABLE - read ""Common Sense on Mutual Funds"" by John C. Bogle. Ahh - much better and same information. If you HATE math - the same message (much simplified) can be gained by reading ""The Coffeehouse Investor"" by Bill Schultheis. (Too simplified for me but fast read and basically can get you on your way to asset allocation quick, easy and effective.)"
4,Intelligent Asset Allocator,"Great book about historical returns and how to adjust your asset allocation accordingly. Good book for anyone interested in indexing their investments. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of time researching and reviewing their investments, this book offers easy solutions. Easy to read, as well. Not bland like many other investment books."
3,This version is ready to retire,"Eddie Cochran / Greatest Hits (Curb): Eddie Cochran made some great music. I've had this Curb version for many years now and I've appreciated having it but this CD has seen it's day and it's time to find a better source. I discovered here in Amazon that there is a Bear Family Records CD of Cochran's best songs (called ""Rocks"") and since I have come to trust the great quality of their productions, I'm gonna replace this one for that one. 5 stars for Eddie Cochran, but only 3 stars for this Curb CD."
4,the ventures a classic group for surf and summertime,"First off I would like to say rest in peace Bob Bogel.My favorite tracks are all of them but Hawaii five o stands out.Bob's guitar work was a signature,kinda of Duane Eddys style.Great album for the price even though there isn't any on this album."
4,This a great CD-Classsic Rock and Roll Instrumental,"The Ventures are awesome especially on their two signiture pieces ""Walk , don't run"" and the ""Theme to Hawaii Five-O. This is one of my favorite instrumental CDs. The playing of the Ventures in awsome from the firery ""Slaughter on tenths avenue"" to beautiful ""theme from A Summer Place""."
2,Works like a non reusable camera!,"In the beginning it will work fine, but then it will malfunction out of the blue and take your important files with it. The Maxtor 40 Gig External Drive erased all my work out of no ware one sunny day and I used a file recovery to retrieve my work. This happened 3 times where the third time I couldn't get nothing back and now it just plain doesn't work. Stay away from Maxtor it's not even worth the cheap price!"
5,Engaging,"This toy was easily and creatively encorporated into broader and extensive dramatic play themes using other toys and blocks, both Tolo and non-Tolo."
2,1 Deep,"Im not feelin' this CD as much as the other Z-Ro records, most of his CD's have lyrics that hit home, this CD is boasting about rims, cash, and no song has the hook im lookin for. ""Let tha truth be told"" and ""Still Livin'"" are my new favs- check em out"
5,great buy get it,This is a great product and great buy. if you need a tank this gets the job done if your begginer or pro.
2,Clueless history of technology irrelevant to real world of cellphone,"This book disappoints severely. Usually Levinson is well on target, but in this book he clearly misses the mark. His examples are massively out of date - in Israel the cellphone penetration was not 75% in 2004, back in 2003 it was 105%, etc etc etc. Levinson has taken a considerable knowledge of change in technology and then applied sloppy research and bad examples to the world of cellphones. Here in Singapore we are also in the over 100% penetration rates for cellphones, and several excellent books about the real impact of cellphones - such as Rheingold's Smart Mobs, Ahonen's m-Profits and Kopomaa's City in the Pocket will give you much more than this. What is most annoying, is that the book is mostly so badly off its topic.I do not recommend this to anyone, not even fans of Levinson. Reading this book will guide you wrong. Luckily there are ample better books about the real world of cellphones. Don't buy it."
2,"Boring, myopic and uninformed","Now for a book that's 180 pages long, it's BORING. This guy can ramble. And despite this he says very little in each page. It could all have been more succinct in 100 pages. He clearly knows a little about a lot about the phone but this book manages to avoid being coherent. Next he seems to write to serve the purpose of the title ensuring to find the cons in any other form of media he can bring up even if he contradicts his point by basically just describing exceptions to what his point was, while trying desperately to find pros in cellphones each and every time. These cons include computers, the internet, and blogging. These are all topics about which the viewpoint is misinformed and skewed and lacking. The book falls flat with padding from the start and apart from some info, it's generally not worth it."
4,The most ridiculous review ever....,"Yes, i know this is moronic, but I just wanted to warn any fellow Gail Kim fanatics such as myself, that the above image is NOT the DVD cover; rather, it's the event's promotional poster. If anybody knows where something like that may be purchased, I'd appreciate the feedback!"
2,Not What I Had Hoped For,"I had waited a long time for this dvd to become available for sale. Then when I finally purchased it from Amazon it was a waste of money for me. It was not what I expected at all - and I am so disappointed. First of all I did not want to see Mike Sardina in his underpants in the first scene and I did not want to hear the family fighting and shouting at each other and using the ""f"" word very freely. I had hoped to see more of their singing instead of their troubled personal life - but suppose that is their story. I wish I would NOT have spent $24.95 buying it.I would rather have just bought a cd of their music as I was a fan of theirs and even went to Mr Sardinas funeral.The photo on the front cover was very attractive - but the content was not !!"
5,"Great Product, Easy Install","This is the same product they had at my local NAPA store, but at a lower price. Installation was easy (required E8 external torx socket that was hard to find on its own). Lifts great."
5,The Bread Machine Cookbook V Received,"This cookbook arrived promptly and in excellent condition. The packaging was excellent and easy to open. The book itself is full of wonderful, delicious bread machine recipes. I have used many of the recipes and love them,."
4,great. but not perfect,"I love this workout, but the layout could be better. The choice of chapters is limited. They should have enabled mix and match for all the chapters. The way it is now -choosing between only one long workout , with a repetiotion of the main program ,or separate shorter workouts, is a little disturbing. I wish it was more flexible and more varied. The program itself is paced well and takes care of most major muscles while benefitting from some aerobics as well.A nice workout for beginners-intermediate exercisers, and a nice change from the eternal :walk, walk,walk! from Leslie's production line."
5,Great Cardio and Toning Workout!!,"I actually didn't care for Debra's first workout, but I thought I'd give her cardio/weight workout a try. I am SOOO glad I did. I love walking workouts, but needed a break from the ""walk, walk, walk!"" woman, and Debra fits that bill very nicely. Even though I am not overweight, I do want to keep fit, and aerobic workouts with turns and steps just don't work for me ... I end up getting frustrated and quitting. The cardio in this workout is a step up from my ""regular leader"" (okay, I'll just say it - Leslie Sansone) in that Debra adds some fun steps (mambos and cha-chas; dancey but NOT DIFFICULT!) and uses weights for better upper body work. Debra also has a very encouraging, positive attitude ... something to look forward to in the morning! Plus I LOVE the upbeat music! :-)"
4,Gets Me Moving,"I read the reviews and decided to purchase this dvd .... I got it put it in and really liked what I saw ... now it took me a few weeks to get to it but now that I'm doing it .... I really like it...it's a REAL total body workout .... I'm reved up and ret to go once I'm finished. I enjoy that the people that I'm follwing look like me and other people I know .... you kind of get that ... if they can do it so can I feeling, no super fit sports model to try and keep up with. The next thing you know ... it's cool down time. This is in my top 3 workout routines."
5,Amazing Product,I got a facial from the Nordstroms spa and this was one of the products I purchased afterwards. Even though it is a small bottle that is pretty pricey it lasts for a very long time. One pump will cover the entire face. It makes your skin very soft and it looks moisturized. It also helps repair old scars. I highly recommend this product.
5,Good seeds,Just good quality Thai sweet basil seeds. The package came with a little instruction in print as well. Good retailer of rare plant seeds.
2,No Luck,I planted them in started seed tray and watered them.... Try to get them to grow three times with no luck...
2,Seeds,"Well I gotta say I got the seeds in about a week, faster than I thought but they don't grow! So I'm stuck still buying my basil from the store."
5,A crackling debut!,"Jack Kerley's The Hundredth Man is a stunning new serial-killer-with-a-twist novel. The basic plot, involving a Mobile (Ala.) detective pursuing a murderer who decapitates his victims, is familiar. What's different is that the cop's brother is a psychotic killer himself, albeit an imprisoned one.Detective Carson Ryder uses his brother as his personal Hannibal Lecter, quizzing his insane sibling about the murders, and using the clues he doles out to pursue the investigation.It's a refreshing change to read a crime novel whose protagonist isn't all-knowing, ready to solve every mystery with incredible intelligence and Holmes-like powers of deduction. The fact that the detective needs help, even if it is from a murderer, makes a nice addition to the story.Kerley may not yet be the master of the genre that Thomas Harris is, but he's gotten off to a great start. The Hundredth Man is a crackling debut.Reviewed by David Montgomery, Chicago Sun-Times"
4,hard-boiled thriller,"Carson Ryder is a homicide detective of the Mobile Police force. When headless corpses start to turn up he and his partner Harry Nautilus try to solve the case despite the tremendous opposition provided by an ambitious superior. And in the meantime Carson also tries to save a boozing pathologist from becoming fired. Carson has a secret and it is through this secret that he may (or may not) be capable of solving the murders. But there is no such thing as a free lunch, so Carson will have to pay for the information and how far is one willing to go to find a serial killer?This is quite an enjoyable read, even though the ""hard-boiled"" language is now and then quite over the top and it is questionable whether in real life a superior would be willing to oppose the detective work as much as implied in this book and whether one would be willing to transport a knife by sticking it into one's leg... But not at all bad for a debut thriller."
2,Forced,"The hook to this book is incredible. I read the first few pages and knew I needed to read the rest. The crimes are interesting at first. Unfortunately, the book as a whole is not good. The writing, especially the dialogue, is overdone. The insane brother is unnecessary and annoying. Most of the plot is taken up by the protagonist melodramatically caring for his alcoholic ladyfriend, rather than doing any actual sleuthing.Thriller isn't my favorite genre, so maybe those who have a soft spot for thrillers will enjoy this more than I did. I've definitely read thrillers worse than this one, I would chose this over a lot of Patterson's books, for example. And I think Kerley has promise, given that this was his first novel. Some thoughtful editing would've gone a long way to tone down the excessive drama and help Kerley's ideas shine."
2,what a disappointment,"Heard really good things about this novel but was very disappointed. Normally can make it through any book no matter how bad but had to give up on this. Concept is there but the writing skills aren't. Not helped by an extraordinarily irritating protagonist - tries to be ""interesting"" but has opposite effect. Shoot the editor - he/she did a lousy job. New editor and maybe a better sequel."
2,A bad Start!,"Jack Kerley made a very dissapointing 'debut' with this novel. 'Hundredth Man, The' is just another serial killer suspense, without any point of originality and - even worse - with a plot so ludicrous, so unbelievable, that you'll feel a jerk to lose your time with a so bottomless book.To say the truth, Mr. Kerley made a direct rip-off of Thomas Harris celebrated characther, Hannibal Lecter, in the figure of the insane brother of the detective who is investigating the case. But all the similarity stops just here. Lecter has something to do and to say in Harris's books but the weird and crazy created by Kerley is just a crazy crying all the time!.Don't lose your time and your money."
3,"I'm OK, you're OK, but these people have problems","I enjoyed the book, but in my opinion, there are a few too many crazy folks in this story. Crazed killer haunted by his past, crazed brother haunted by his past, detective haunted by his crazed brother, and the crazed killer, and the crazed killer from his first case. Luckily, he now has an alcoholic new girlfriend. That should work out well.That said, I did find the story entertaining, just a few too many plot twists and turns. Even with all the flashbacks, of which there are many, when it was over I still wondered what exactly happened to turn the killer (the main killer, not the killer from the first case, or the killer brother) into the crazed killer he becomes."
3,A good first effort.,"The character of Ryder and his history is intriguing if a bit familiar. I really enjoyed his experienced partner Harry. The crimes are suitably unusual enough you really want to know who and why, and really don't know until the end. But the secondary characters were, for the most part, easy stereotypes and their issues much to easily overcome. All-in-all, it's a good first effort, but I'll hope for more from his next book."
3,Another who thinks like a killer,"Where do they come from? If all these detectives have this ability, how come we need to wait til the bad guys make a mistake? Oh, I forgot. This is fiction, and as such, is passable. But can someone give us a variation?"
3,theckman,"Not bad. I read it because it was recommend...not nearly as good as any of the ""Rain"" books."
1,Do NOT order this!!!!,"Great memory, but a company called BlueProton Consulting will be shipping it at a hugely inflated cost. I was charged $12.50 to ship something the size of a postage stamp. Pretty lame. Eff you Blue Proton!~!!!"
1,Beware of the seller: BlueProton,I purchased a 4 GB SD card from this vendor. Unfortunately my camera did not recognise the SDHC format. I contacted them so I could return the SD HC card(it works only with SD card apparantly). They provided a return address and form which I duly filed and returned the product. I asked for a non HC SD card or to return my money. It has been 3 months since. The company now does not even respond to my emails.I was not ahppy with the purchase from Blue proton.
4,SDHC Card & Reader,"The BlueProton reader is made of cheap thin plastic. However, the reader works without any problems. I did have a problem with a bad Sandisk 4gb sdhc card. The card was replaced and everthing works as is should. The reader fits easily into a shirt pocket. Great if you want to take the reader to work. For the price, this reader / card combo is a good deal."
4,Does the Job,"A little flimsy-feeling, but a great deal and perfectly adequate. I use it to review pictures from my camera and generally just leave it attached to a usb port."
5,Good deal,Bought the card and reader for less than everyone else charges for just the card on sale. Works fine in every product I've put it in so far.
5,"Good Deal, no problems","I bought this because the card reader that is on my computer will not work with high capacity SD cards. This works as described, and requires no software. Enough said."
1,Heavily Weighed My Hair Down!,"I was really hoping this would be a good deep conditioning treatment, especially for protein purposes. But, no such luck. Used it after my wash and sat under a dryer for about 20 mins. After rinsing, it wasn't all that good of a detangler. My hair wasn't very difficult to comb while wet, but there was some snagging. After roller setting & drying, my hair was VERY HEAVY. There was no bounce in my hair, it's absolutely flat & blah. Wrapping my hair took more effort than it should. Since it's so weighed down, my hair doesn't even keep the shape. To the touch, it almost feels like I heavily greased my hair with vaseline. With that said, I'm still on the hunt for a good protein deep conditioner that doesn't weigh my hair down or feel greasy."
5,Great recipes!,"Just reading the recipes makes your mouth water. I have only tried two of the recipes, but both were wonderful. The pictures are fantastic and the book, with it's spiral bound hardback, lays open easily. Several of my family members were so impressed that they had me order this book for them as well."
1,Author Needed,"I've been waiting for an author to tackle this topic by writing either a non-fiction treatment of the involvement of Blacks in the Holocaust or to focus on concentration-camp survivor, Ms. Valaida Snow's life story. Unfortunately, this author chose neither. She lacks the scholarly knowledge and writing skills to meet the challenge of such a project. This appears to be Dr. Camp's personally published pamphlet on an area she failed to research. Her religous agenda is apparent throughout this cursory, poorly thought out fictionalized narrative. No mention is made of primary or secondary sources. I hope that in the future someone with the required training will make a serious untaking of this challenging and untouched area of history."
5,Luffy is goofy,"Monkey D. Luffy wants to be king of the pirates. He has no ship, no crew. When he gets them, he doesn't do piratey things like robbing and sinking ships. He doesn't kill people, just beats them senseless. He spends his time defeating bad guys, crooked police and politicians. His body has the power to stretch like rubber. Unfortunately his brain seems to be made of rubber too. Why he calls himself a pirate instead of the more accurate adventurer is anyone's guess. Still, the adventures are great fun and a load of laughs. As long as you keep your food under lock and key."
5,One Piece,I like the series and Funimation it self as an company one of the most companies that deliver great and good voice acting to there anime they put there heart and soul into the anime like One Piece to Full Metal Alchemsit at a good price for one full season. I just got back into One Piece and love it hoping to give funimation my money for this anime with great story lines and even great characters. Glad they stick to the series openings and endings dub way to go Funimation for there choices of singers who are very good at there job you make this One Piece fan very happy.
1,Switch to bluray,"There's no reason for them to be releasing 4 disks per set, and then only giving 24 episodes.Even if it isn't HD they could still fit 100+ episodes on one disk.This is no different from what they did with DBZ, they see that people love this show and find a way to milk every single penny they can."
5,She has literally loved it to pieces!!,"My daughter is now 18 months old. We bought this book when she was just over a year old. It was exactly what I was looking for - one picture, one word per page. I was worried because it wasn't a board book, but my little girl was so interested in it I relented and let her look at it independently. She's done very well, but she loves it so much it is falling apart! I'm sure this book has increased her vocabulary greatly and I can't recommend it enough!!!"
4,One of my 1-year-old son's favorites!,"We got this book as a gift. I thought it was an awful lot of pages for a 1-year-old, and it's not a board book. But it's among my son's top 5 favorite books, and it's proven to be quite sturdy. With just one picture per page, it's very easy for him to focus and learn while we read together. He especially loves the animal section at the end."
3,bathroom remodel,This is a good enough book but lacks specifics. Great deal of text deals with common sense stuff that most people would already have done.
1,This book is a scam,It's a vanity press special. The book is horrible and only serves as a bullet point on the child author's resume. The writing displays a complete lack of emotional maturity. The whole piece is an exercise in narcissism. Don't waste a cent on this piece of trash.
1,This is awful!,"This book is a most horrible example of literature. The ill-prepared characters are only outdone by the premature events which lead to an overly-condenced piece of vanity press. The illustrations only worsen the situation, because of the fact that they are poorly-drawn and using cut and paste from the internet. Giving this book one star is too generous, and giving this to small children may result in crying.P.S. The last reviews on this page with 5 stars were writen by the author. Simply disgusting. I loahthe him for that."
1,Know this kid,"I'm a firend of his brother, so I've met the nice author, and he's a nice kid and all, but he stunk at this book. He founded a violin charity group and is in the kid's hall of fame for it, but all of the reviews on the back are by family friends and the book was a stink bomb. And the reason the rating is so high is because his friends and family wrote good stuff about it so he was famous, moreso, and earned cha-ching, and wasn't thought of as a book writing failure. Book stinkerooni."
1,Pay no attention to the last 3 reviews.,"I have noticed that the last 3 reviews on this page are fakes, obviously, because no one speaks that way. As for the book itself, it does not deserve the 3-star rating it has, which is the result of fake reviews. It's aims, writen by a child, fell about a mile from the lowest expectations of an author. I despise this book."
3,This had fantastic potential...,"I was disappointed in this book. The Hudson Valley is a magnificent well for story tellers and I was excited to read about the generations who had lived in a single home and worked on its orchard.This is much more a creative writing guide than a history of a house/family. Philip spends chapters describing the writing process, but not enough about the actual home/family. The writing parts would have made an excellent preface, but the book needed more substantative history.Too often Philips interupts herself to backtrack to modern times.This had great potential, but left me looking for another book."
1,The disappearance of a purchased item.,"This product never arrived, and I completely forgot that I'd ordered it until this request for a review appeared. Dammit."
2,My old diaper dude bag is better/ sturdier than the new one i got,"I bought this bag in black/pink color to replace my daughter's old diaper dude bag in orange/gray color which we used for almost 1 1/2 years. I like this bag because the outside pockets fit my daughter's Dr Brown bottles. However, after only 2 weeks of use the seam on the side of the zipper of the main compartment started getting loose and parted. We don't put too much stuff inside the bag - just a pair of clothes, 4-6 pcs of diapers, small/ thin wipes container and a small milk container. I love my old diaper dude bag and i would have loved this except that the diaper bag i received is not as durable as our old one."
4,"Nice, sturdy bag","The bag is nice and sturdy, but could be a little more spacious for the size. The pockets are pretty small, although we manage to stuff a bottle in two of the pockets and maybe a bib in the other."
3,Touching Christmas tales,"Of the three stories. My favorite was the tale written by Tori Phillips. She writes the Twelfth Knight, and the story involves Alyssa Cavendish. She must chose a husband among the suitors her parents invite to their castle. Alyssa is known as a hellcat, so her father must bribe the would-be suitors. Little does Alyssa know that there is a ""knight"" in disguise to woo her. A fun read and light. I finished in a day."
5,EASILY THE BEST BOOK IN THE X-WING SERIES,Stackpole is a creative genius. The characters are well developed and the action is incredible.THIS BOOK ROCKS ! THIS BOOK ROCKS ! THIS BOOK ROCKS ! THIS BOOK ROCKS ! THIS BOOK ROCKS ! THIS BOOK ROCKS ! THIS BOOK ROCKS ! THIS BOOK ROCKS ! THIS BOOK ROCKS ! THIS BOOK ROCKS !
5,THE Greatest X-Wing Novel yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an action pack book that is the greatest X-Wing book yet. The Rouges resign, all of them, and decide to go one-on-one against Isard who not by chance has settled in Thyffera, the planet that produces bacta. And Corosaunt is suffering from the Krytos virus, whose only cure is bacta. So the rouges go after Isard and the bacta. Hence giving the name The Bacta War. People might think me crazy but i thought it was quite funny. Especialy the diologs between Booster and Corran. It wont be easy because they have a ship feared even by the New Republic fleet. The Lusankya. One of the only remaining Super Star Destroyers left in the empire. Or whats left of it. A book that will produce lots of laughs and you will not be dissopointed with it at all. Trust me. One worth bying"
2,This book was boring just like all the other X-wing books,My opionion of the X-wing series is that they all are really boring books. The best part of the X-wing series is when Corran Horn found out he was a Jedi. I've read 47 of the Star Wars books and the X-wing series is the worst!
4,Grab a broom and a dust pan...,"...because it's time to take out the trash! That's right, now that the New Republic has Corsucant and, because of political reasons, is focusing its military might elsewhere, the now freelance Rogue Squadron has to take on Ysanne Isard and her Bacta Cartel alone. But that's okay, impossible is what Rogue Squadron does best. A fitting close to the first cycle of stories in the X-Wing series. Highly recommended."
3,Stackpole's Second Best Effort,"If you made it through the first 3 books you will be relieved to find that this one is much better. Finally some action, but Stackpole manages to still find ways to waste the characters time."
5,Great!!! Stackpole Does It Again!,"The Bacta War was a top- notch book! Stackpole is one of the only SW writers who gives their new characters, (almost everyone) depth. He excludes the boring details about events that most SW fans already know about (Kevin J. Anderson) and skips to brand- new action. A great break if your sick of the same old Luke, Han, Leia, and their twins novels. I mean how many times are they going to get kidnapped, anyway?"
4,"Action Packed, Well developed characters !!!","Stackpole really did an excellent job on the Bacter War. There has been a grate improvement since he wrote Rogue Sqaudron, which to me was the worst in the series. However I do like his style of developing his chareacters before killing them. You get to know about every commandig officer aboard each of the Impstar Duece's and SSD's.I thought that was really help. It was tedious to me at times but gave story more depth. Another interesting aspect I liked was his use of betrayel trough the series. Even though I thought the situation with Bror Jace and Gavin were confirmed Stackpole would surprise me with a different ending for their situations. I would have given this book 5*'s but I hated those ground missions."
5,The Bacta War was the best book of the series.,The way that Booster was buying up all of the warhead launchers he could find so that he could arm the station for the battle with the Lusankya was a great strategy that Stackpole came up with. The final battle with the Lusankya and the other sStar Desroyers was the best space battle scince Endor.
4,"Where were Luke, Han, Lando, and lea?","Some of them appear a little, but not enough. They should be the main characters."
5,The best of the X-Wing series!,"While I was slow to get into the series, I am sad to see it go. Bacta War is a fitting conclusion to the series. The dog fights are some of the best I have ever read. The moments between the action were captivating. A must-read"
3,Bad B movie,"Slightly cute, almost comedic at first with the horribly bad acting and shoddy camera work. Mostly bought this movie because it had a dachshund in it, but after a while the bad acting just gets annoying."
4,"Lithium Springs is kind of like a new ""Earnest Goes Green"" film!","This film was done by an independent film maker and it does at times show that they had a budget to stick to. But some of the scenes you wouldn't know it as they are simply gorgeous! I will not spoil it but picture is an Indiana Jones crossed with an Earnest Goes Green type film and you have it. The real Star is ""Fred"" the dachshund. He is a natural and fits in the plot and film nicely. If nature, saving the environment, money grubbing politics and the like are your type of a family movie (and yes this is a lets ALL sit home, grab the popcorn and it is safe viewing for all) do so. You will laugh, some is a little over a child's level but they will easily identify with the characters and again FRED, he steals the show!"
1,"Sorry, this movie was a disappointment....","Unless you are wanting to punish someone, Do NOT purchase this movie! I only bought it because I am a dachshund fan, with two of my own, but I would have been better off using my money for dog treats than on this low budget movie! I had to force myself to watch it though completely, just hoping it would get better...but it never did! It is filled with bad acting, out of date costumes, and a very cheesy story line. The ONLY good thing about this movie were the shots of Fred the dachshund. I would have enjoyed just watching pictures of the dachshund minus everything else that was in this terribly produced movie! Sorry, but if you are looking to purchase this movie for the same reason I did, don't waste your money!"
2,Lithuim Springs,Not what I expected. A little too corny for middle school. It would probably be good for 3rd or 4th grade.
4,covers,For as small as they are they protect your phone great. I would recommend anyone to get them for your phone if you don't want to spend a lot of money on other covers.
3,its ok- easier to grip phone,"The case is more of a soft plastic; I thought it would be harder, but I do like how it has grips on the sides. It's a lot easier to hold my huge phone now. Other than that, there's nothing special about it but it doesn't seem like it will crack like my otterbox did!"
3,Orange Cell Cover,"I bought this cover for one it is orange, but I also thought that it would be more.. shinny!! But it aint. I guess I didnt read the listing if it. It shows your phone a whole lot and when it rains, your phone gets soaked with wetness!! Overall I did like it."
5,Fun and Functional,"So many of the cases are just thin plastic and don't have any grip. This case is flexible, has sides that are textured so it's easy to grip and doesn't slip. It's a great color and fun design."
3,"Good, but doesn't fit great.","It looks good and it's definitely slim, but the fit isn't that great. It bows out a little on the sides, and makes the power button pretty hard to use."
3,the rods are weak.,first day I got it the rod broke as Im trying to clean my .22 i was taking my time and not rushing the cleaning process. overall I like the product but wish the rods were a little stronger
3,Not really compatible with my air rifle,I ordered this kit to clean my new Crosman Trail NP .22 rifle. The .22 brass brush and adapter were just too big for my rifle. I could get the end of the brush in and then it would get stuck. I was afraid of scratching the inside of the barrel so I just gave up.Even the slot tip did not fit in the barrel. I ended up using the .17 brass brush and a fabric cleaning tip to clean and oil the barrel.
1,"Nothing lined up, totally useless","Not recommended! Poor quality, The screw together components do not line up, it came to me already cross screwed. Useless."
4,OK for the small price...,"The guide rod was very unsteady and flimsy, I was afraid it would snap each time I used it. But it didn't. You get what you pay for, and so far this kit is nothing nice or fancy, but it also has done its job thus far."
5,Rifle cleaning kit,"Used it when it arrived and doe's a great job. Would be nice if it came in a box,rather than the plastic holder,or even a cloth holder,would have worked. Will make something myself,easy enough too do. But again price rule's and if in the market for this type of cleaning kit then this is a good buy."
3,Decent but Repetitive,"I really like Texhnolyze and the theme song ""Guardian Angel"" is cool too. I wish they had the original of the song and not just the extended one on this disc. I got my copy of this as a bonus in a set with the first DVD of the anime series. I recommend it as good music to fill a room but not to be focused on - it can get boring. Some of the tracks just drag on, but others are fun. ""Guardian Angel"" is the highlight of the album, though."
5,Rent is the best!,"The piano/vocal selections from ""Rent"" are the best. Okay, so they don't sound EXACTLY like the recording, but nothing's perfect. All of my favorite songs are in the book, and most of them work well on piano. Some of the rhythm patterns in the rock songs (like ""Rent"", ""Out Tonight"", and ""What You Own"") may be and should be altered so it would sound right on the piano. Songs like ""Halloween"" and ""Another Day"" are transcribed perfectly. All of the songs are great and there are cool pictures in the front of the book too."
2,Doesnt Work for Piano,"The music in Rent is great but it doesnt ""port"" well over to piano (at least my level of play)."
5,Rent is the best musical ever!!!,"Because Rent is the best musical ever, so of course the vocals selections of it are also the best!!!"
4,A Good yet not great book of music,"This book is a good book for an experienced piano player. By the music that is contained in this book, you do not get the feeling while playing it, as if you were in the theatre listening to the band. Yet, it is a good book to learn and discover the favorite melodies of the hit broadway musical. If you are a true RENTaholic, it is a must have!"
4,Great printer for photos!,"Like most printers this works best in high quality mode. I was recommended this printer for photos. It works great with even low quality photo paper. The images are clear, color is good and the ink does not smear. The salesperson said that you can spill water on the print so I tested it . . . image (on photo paper) did not smear or come off the paper.Test with card stock did not fare very well. The pictures were not clear. The printer was able to handle the thick stock without any jamming.In fast mode even the text is a little pixilated and not really clear.Conclusion: with good paper this makes long lasting crisp clear images in high quality mode. The printer will not print to the edge of the paper so for a photo printer you will need a cutter."
4,"crisp, fast, clean","This printer is fast, and produces excellent quality, crisp, clean images. My only grumbles are that I haven't found 3rd party ink (the brand name stuff is shockingly expensive), and that the variety of paper sizes it supports are somewhat limited.I haven't had it long enough yet to get a good sense as to how long the cartridges last, so maybe the pricy-ness is justified (if they last a good long time, that is).Otherwise, this is an excellent workhorse quality color printer."
2,"Not the usual ""Wilton"" look in cakes","Jenne has some fun, creative and original ideas for cake decorating. Yes, they do look a bit sloppy, but then these are not the usual ""Wilton"" frosting daisies and roses. The reason for just 2 stars is some of the recipes aren't very good with questionable instructions. For example, the one for Chocolate Granache calls for UNSWEETENED chocolate and cream. That's it. And it's absolutely vile tasting. I ended up using Jacques Pepin's recipe from his ""La Technique"" cookbook. And the Konditor cake needs a special Croquembouche mold which will set you back about $90-$110. I think this book is for more experienced bakers who can spot a questionable recipe, but then they probably have better cookbooks in their libraries."
2,Disappointing,"After reading all of the reviews on this book I was left confused by the extreme selection of critiques. After seeing the beautiful carrot cakes on the cover I decided this could hardly be the work of a ""sloppy"" decorator and went ahead and ordered. What can I say, the cover most definitely does not reflect the level of work inside, which can only be described as ..well.. sloppy! My 12 year old daughter had produced better looking cookies than these!! I can't say anything about the recipes because quite frankly none of them inspired me to try. The only thing that interested me was the explanation on how to make checkerboard or pinwheel cookies, but I didn't need to buy a book just for that. So, if you're undecided about whether to purchase this book as I was, my advice is save your money!"
3,The same book,"If you purchase this book, it is no need to purchase the one titled Decorating Cakes and Cookies by the same author. It is the same book just a different cover."
3,Interesting for sure,"This book has some good cookie recipes and techniques,but the decorating style is very sloppy.If I walked into his bakeshop and found the pictured items for sale,I would pass."
4,Gorgeous!,"Lovely pictures, easy to follow recipes and great directions.If you are interested in decorating cakes, this is a nice book to have."
3,Cheap packaging.,"This compilation of Peggy Lee hits has the look and feel of a generic, quickly-assembled collection of readily available commercial material aimed at the mass market. Maybe it was advertized on one of those cable television infomercials, or manufactured for the impulse purchasers at Walmart and truck stops. In any case, genuine Peggy Lee fans and close followers of her career will want a remastered, intelligently edited collection that provides information about the original recordings, their labels, and dates of release."
4,First Introduction But It's Good,"I've never listened to much Peggy Lee before, but in an attempt to get to know some of the traditional pop singers better, I selected this album. I am really quite impressed. The song ""Is that all there is"" is a great song, and so many more of the songs are really good. Her voice is excellent, and reminds every now and then of even Billie Holiday."
1,Invicta Repair Kit,1st time I used the pin removal toolthe threaded part fell apart. Wasable to clamp together to get itworking.(weak point on tool)Will have to super glue to repair.
5,"Excellent value, great addition to digital photo work","Making selections is as easy as pie with the Wacom pen tablet. Using the lasso tool in photoshop was painful with a mouse, but is much easier with the pen tablet. The pen is about the size of a normal pen and is quite comfortable to hold. There are two customizable buttons on the pen which you can set to keystroke modifiers like ALT and SHIFT, making switching between adding to a selection subtracting from a selection possible without having to use the keyboard.The low price of this table is worht every penny, but with the accompanying software (Photoshop Elements 3), this is a real bargain."
4,It was great.,"I loved this product. though i just got a new laptop and it has vista on it. the product installed well, but know that the photoshop elements 3.0 doesn't work AS WELL on vista. other than that this entire product was flawless. -STUDENT"
1,This isn't the comedian.,"I bought this tape set thinking it was featuring the comedian Carrot Top. It's not. It's an educational animated cartoon adventure. A previous review had led me to believe otherwise. I'm sure the tapes are fine for those who want the cartoon, I only put a one star rating because I had to put something in order for this review to be printed. Buyer beware!"
5,Innovation of monster speaker,"This is some great speakers, i got mind a week ago and they sound great even on my bluray the sound come out smooth and even,be sure to have a great amps for turntables and a great receiver to kill the sound out with these baby, this is the{""godzilla""}of monster speaker it pushing 1200 watts of power and i mean ['power']don't be fool by imatation this is the real deal; buy it; get it; and live it. ted brown"
1,don't waste your time,"The speakers that were sent, Well one was hardly working and the other sounded loud but was not very good on the low end......So my search is still on for A good low end sounding pair"
2,Somewhat unique writing style,"This book consists of a series of interconnected stories set on the Great Plains. Mainly they are about a field hand named Sorry. Writes in choppy, subject-less sentences like this one. Really gets annoying after a while. Thinks it's a unique midwestern style. Can't agree with him there. Sorry."
3,this is definitely not a 4-burger grill,"1. This will NOT fit 4 regular size burgers. Even with a junior burger, you can only fit 3.2. Cleaning is NOT as easy as it was portrayed. You will need to wash it as you would with other pots and pans.3. Does not cook pork chops evenly because of the bone.4. The top plate is not as hot as the the bottom plate.Summary: it does the job. But for the claim of it giving you the best grill meat? Well, if you are comparing it with McD or BK. Buy this grill if you want a quick meal with less cooking effort. But if you want ""good"" food, this is not the solution."
4,"O.K., but...","This grill is built pretty well, but the grease catcher coul be bigger, and it seems to take a lot longer to cook stuff than maybe it should."
4,If You Marinate It Will Taste Good!!,"I don't do the cooking with this grill. My job is to clean it and before this we had the grill that did not have removable grills and it was hard to clean. It took me forever to scrub it that I was tempted on many occasions drop it on the floor in hopes it would break so I wouldn't have to scrub and clean it anymore! so when we got this new grill and I was able to remove the grills it was so much better and easy to clean and I love the new grill!Some reviewers are complaining about their food not tasting good and I think that some of those reviewers are expecting to just throw on a piece of meat, chicken or fish and it's magically going to taste great.PEOPLE: You have to marinate the food first with a tasty marinade sauce that is either home made or a prepackaged store made marinade. Just let whatever you are going to cook soak in the maranade for a while and your food should taste great!"
3,George Foreman GRP4P grill,"I like my new George Foreman grill because it is so easy to remove and wash the plates. That is a big plus. However, it seems that the top grill does not get as hot as the bottom grill. It has a smoother pattern, and that side does not get as brown as the bottom."
2,Not so great,"I just bought the George Forman grill after really enjoying a Krups panini maker I've been using all summer at a friend's house. I thought this alternative would be more versatile (for meats in addition to sandwiches) and easier to clean with the removable plates (panini makers don't usually have this feature). Well, I was immediately disappointed by the small cooking surface, at least 30-40% smaller than a panini maker. And the grilling plates, while removable, also seemed very lose and the overall of the machine wasn't very sturdy. So, back in the box it went and I just ordered a panini maker instead (actually a Delonghi as it has strong reviews and also allows for oil draining so will hopefully be a better combination of the features I am looking for. I'd pass on this product unless you are already familiar with these George Forman grills and know what to expect."
1,Not what we'd hoped for!,"Don't know if this was a defective product or a problem with the GRP4 in general, but the upper part of the grill did not get hot enough to toast bread in paninis, or to grill burgers. We had to flip the sandwich/burger over to get that 'brown' look.As a result, we chose to return the GRP4 for a refund.In the past, we've like the George Foreman products. We hope this was a fluke!"
3,Not that great,"This grill takes a little while to clean, but it's fairly easy and the non stick surface has held up well. It kind of smells of burning plastic when you cook. Food comes out somewhat dry. And it can also crush burgers. Maybe it's good for ease of use, but not for great meals."
3,Worked pretty well until one of the grill plates broke,"This is a decent grill. It did pretty much exactly what I wanted it to do and never had a problem until recently.I don't know whether to blame myself or the grill, but when I dropped a grill plate the feature that snaps the plate into the grill snapped off. I know that I dropped it, but I don't think a 3 foot drop should cause a grill plate to snap and become almost useless. Also George Foreman does not sell replacement plates anymore.The fact that you can remove the plates is nice, but they are not very easy to clean. A dishwasher alone will not get these clean. Get ready to scrub.It would be nice if it heated up quicker as well.Overall a decent product though."
1,Item looks like it was used,"I purchased this as a Valentine's gift for my husband. The top of the grill is white paint with flat black painted over white paint for the handle. The line between the two colors is not sharp and looks like they used poor tape and it leaked under. The black paint has an awful scrub mark with what looks like steel wool! Also, the front of the bottom plate (outside) is scratched and missing the coating. I didn't even plug it in. So unhappy. I still own 2 of the original small white ones. I currently have a huge red one that I have used for 4 years but the heat light is broken and the plates are no longer non-stick. Thought I could replace it with this. Do not purchase if you plan on leaving this out for everyday use. Already returned it."
3,why i removed george foreman from wish list,"the price went up, as I have noticed is customary when I put something on my wishlist but I don't buy it right away - shame on you!"
3,"OK, but not stellar.","I don't cook meat, so I didn't think I would want one of these until my sister used it for shrimp and portabellos. Then I was torn because of the mixed reviews here, but decided to ahead. I am not thrilled, but I still use it.Cons: Like many other reviewers, I find the grill cooks unevenly. I have to press down hard with both handles to cook somewhat evenly, and even then I sometimes have to take food on one side off before the other is done, and sometimes I even have to flip food.The instructions say to heat up for 7 minutes before you start! So if you add that in, it's not as fast as people say.Pros: Shrimp and scallops cooked on this taste great, as do portabellos. And eggplant parm is less of a hassle than when using a frying pan. So it does have some value.Overall I would say it has a very slight positive impact on my life in the kitchen."
1,"Not totally useless, but close",This grill is not very accurately described. It is described as a four burger size grill. We tried standard quarter pound frozen burgers and could not even fit three on this grill. Maybe 4 mini burgers would fit. The first time I used it was on some butterfly porkchops. It is suppose to cook from top and bottom at the same time. I raised the lid several times over a period of fifteen minutes and the top was hardly cooked at all. I got the spatula and was going to toss them into my trusty skillet to finish them off. When I flipped them over the bottom was black. May as well have an open grill. Also after about the fourth use the supposed non stick surface stopped non sticking. It would be an improvement if they would make the plates out of cast iron and forget the non stick stuff that don't work. The only plus to this grill is that the plates can be removed and soaked a while.
1,Stopped working after 1st use,"This my first grill of any kind. Unfortunately, I can not rate this product, since it stopped working while I was cooking my 1st fricken steak. I can't figure out why it suddenly shut off after about 15-20 mins and never came back on. I tried every plug in my kitchen, but it was dead. Needless to say, I have no idea if this product is really great or not. Hopefully, my replacement grill will not be defective."
1,Doesn't leave grill marks!,"The whole reason grilling is attractive to me is because of the grill marks. We bought this two days ago and made salmon filets the same evening, only to find that they looked exactly as they might have done had we cooked them in a non-stick frying pan.I'm not sure what the point is. The distinct grill marks you see on the packaging are faked, and you can tell because they are not the same thickness on each of the food items shown, nor does the distance between each line correspond to the distance between the ridges on the grill!Plus, you can't control the temperature of the thing. It's either on or off.I can't say the salmon turned out bad, but it was a little overdone (we followed the directions in the recipe book which said 9 minutes for a 1-inch thick filet)."
1,Does Not Drain the Grease !,"I've used two different George Foreman Next Grilleration's and both produce the same result. I do not know why they do this, some fault in the design I suppose. These grills do not drain the grease! The whole point of a George Foreman grill is they are supposed to remove the grease and fat from the food with little effort on your part. This particular foreman fails at just that."
4,smokeless,it's awesome the smoke doesn't fill up like it would on a regular pan/griller because the fat and fluids are drained down. doesn't quite cook it as quickly because the plates are detachable i guess as other reviewers have noted. easy to clean though.
5,George Foreman and A+,The George Foreman GRP4 is a wonderful indoor grill. I especially like the size and the removable grill elements. It's so easy to use and clean.
4,George Foreman Grill -- Better than the 'ole gas grill,"I like the removable grill plates feature, which makes it much easier to clean than the earlier fixed plate model. However, the heat transfer to the grill plates is slower, so it takes longer to get up to operating temp."
4,Works well. Sometimes uneven cooking.,"Great little grill for steaks, chicken, veggies.Sometimes when I am cooking steaks the top will have a nice dark cooked color, while the bottom of the steaks will have that greay, cooked in a pan look. Tells me the top is hotter than the bottom, or the pressure from the top grill cooks more efficient than the bottom.Overall I would suggest this grill to a friend, and would buy again no problem."
5,no problems,Everything arrived on time. It was in excellent condition and I have no problems with the product! Love this grill- it's perfect for us. Its the perfect size and I love the removable plates.
2,George Foreman GRP4 Next Gen Grill,"This was a replacement for my older 72in George Foreman Next Gen Grill. As other reviews have stated, this does NOT heat up correctly and sear/grill the food. It produces a lot of steam and bakes the meat, not grill it. I contacted the company and their solution is for me to cut the electrical cord and send it back to them with $7.50 and they will send a replacement. I don't think that will be a solution, since many people are having the same complaint. This product is not the same as older models. I have had 3 Foreman grills and this is the only 1 that has not worked correctly.I would think twice about buying it until they fix the issue. It seems to be the top grill that does not get hot enough. The bottom of the meat sears a little but not the top."
2,A disappointment!,"This grill simply does not grill. I've tried hamburgers, chops and fish, and it all sort of simmers but does not brown or get crisp. My old Foreman which did not have removable plates worked wonderfully. Unfortunately, I gave it away before I tried this new one, and now I'm stuck with this which doesn't do the job at all. Very disappointed. I would have sent it back, but I ran out of time."
4,George Foreman GRP4,"I bought this as a step up from the original GF grill and I must say I like this one a lot more mainly due to the fact no more standing and scraping the stuff off the grill surfaces without being able to put it in the sink or dishwasher. That alone make this beast worth its weight in gold but add to it the added grilling surface which I can now stick 3 5-6 oz chicken breasts on!! If you are on the fence on which one of the GF grills to get like I was it came down to size and price and for under 40 dollars I am now able to grill 3 chicken breasts at the same time in roughly 9 minutes give or take, plus I can now wash the surfaces in the sink."
5,Removable plates = Excellent,"We have used an older smaller GFG for a long time. We have been trying to cook ahead for the week more so it was helpful to increase how much we could have on the grill at one time instead of waiting for an hour to cook a bunch. Having the removable plates is our favorite part. It makes cleaning the thing so much easier and less cumbersome! Great improvement! It heats up fast, and cooks evenly. Hopefully this one lasts forever like the other one."
3,The love I lost...,...my Champ. I read removal trays (got excited!) did not read any further. I fail to notice there is NO timer or automatic shut off. I miss my Champ. P.S. Love the RED!!!
5,Grill,"Oh, George what a handy kitchen helper for the working generation. I've had many of these grills and I just keep updating mine with a newer addition. Love it!"
5,Love it!,We use the George Foreman grill for many different things. After seeing the amount of grease that gets cooked out of hamburgers on this grill I could not eat them any other way. The removable plates on this grill make it perfect. We loved our old Foreman grill but trying to get it clean without submerging the electric parts was a chore.
4,Works Great,"Slow warm up, but real convient. The plates come out to be put in the dishwasher for clean-up."
3,George Foreman GRP 4P grill,This grill was not what I expected as it's not really large enough for four large burgers. I do like the removable grill plates.The grease tray is poor quality. I would not buy it again.
4,grill review,"The george Foreman grill does a good job doing what we bought it for. This is our second one, we liked both of them."
5,A pleasant surprise,"First indoor grill I've owned, and I'm impressed with the results. I find it much easier to use and easier to clean than I had expected. Fortunately, reviews of various models steered me to one with removable nonstick grilling plates for quick cleaning, for which I am grateful. The nonstick feature still works fine after repeated uses. The grilling times suggested in the manual did need to be adjusted slightly by trial and error, but that has not been much of a problem, even for this novice."
5,These Grills are Wonderful!,"I bought this one for a gift. They didn't have the removeable grills when I bought mine. This is one of the most used kitchen appliances in my kitchen.My husband likes a BBQ'd steak rain, shine or snow! It is so nice not to have to go out in the weather to cook a steak! And it is so fast! 3 mins to cook a ribeye steak. No more waiting for the coals to get hot. I also like how I can throw a frozen chicken breast on it and it will cook it perfectly in about 4 mins. Makes great grilled sandwiches too."
2,Great! But died after 4 months...,The grill worked very well for the first 4 months. Today I went to turn it on and the thing was unresponsive. No LED lighting up as usual. It didn't warm up. Dead.
1,Factory Defect,"One of the heating plate latches (top right) was not positioned correctly and was impossible to latch, so I returned the unit."
3,It was just OK!,"I thought this grill would replaced my old Foreman grill, but it didn't. I bought this for the convenience of being able to detach the grill plates to wash, but noticed that the parts seemed flimsy. The cooking grill was the same size as my old Foreman grill, too. So, all-in-all, I had to return this item, didn't want to keep something that I deem inferior to what I already have. (However, if you have never own a Foreman grill, this grill could be a could start.)"
3,Mixed feelings here,"I have the smaller grill which I have enjoyed quite a bit but it doesn't cook very much at a time so I bought this one. I was expecting something similar in cook times but this has not been the case. The grill takes much longer to cook chicken then the smaller grill though shrimp cooks in about the same amount of time. Also the grill does not cook evenly, the left side cooks slower then the right.I do like being able to remove the plates to clean them though. Cleanup is easy and quick."
3,Easy clean but slow heating,The removable plates make cleanup very easy. I purchased this unit because the original foreman grill I had was so difficult to clean. The drawback to the easy clean is the slow warm-up time and lower cooking temperature as the plates do not make great contact with the heating surface. I does not brown things as well as the original.
4,"George Foreman GRP4 Next Generation, removable plates","I ordered one of these for my son-in-law and then ordered one for myself. He loves his and I do like mine. Heats well, cooks great. I had another George Foreman type grill and it had a timer feature which I do miss but the easy clean up of the grill more than makes up for the lost timer."
1,"George Foreman GRP4P Next Grilleration 4-Burger Grill with Removable Plates, Platinum","Grill is long and skinny, dimensions are unclear as to the grill size. Had to return it due to this! To skinny to fit two burgers, but too big for one burger, not well designed, especially for a new style."
5,It's Great,It is wonderful. It cooks everything to perfection and the removable heating plates make clean up a breeze. Just the right size for two or for one big steak like a porterhouse. I just love it!!!!!!!!!!
3,okay product,i'm not sure I would purchase again. it is almost as easy to just cook it on the grill outside
4,IT WORKS AS ADVERTISED,"I resisted buying one of these because I thought it just another kitchen gadget that would only take up space, but bought it because a frequent guest, when asked how he wanted his steak, told me he cooks his 5 minutes on his G. Foreman. I respected his and his wife's taste so got the grill.I like it. I use it. With the removable plates, it's a cinch to clean."
2,Very Disappointed,"I have always loved my Cooks Essentials' George Foreman grill, and decided to upgrade to this unit since it had the removable grill plates. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in the performance of this grill and have gone back to using my original grill. This grill does not get hot enough to sear the food, and it was a waste of time using it. I didn't bother sending it back since I would have had to pay for shipping, which means I'm out the total cost of this unit. Never again!"
3,George Foreman removable plate grill,"There was supposed to be a bell that went off when the food was done and there wasn't. There was also supposed to be a light that went off when the heating element reached the right temperature and there wasn't. Consequently,my food burned. I have just written to the manufacturer. If I get no satisfaction I will return it."
4,Best George Foreman So Far,"This is the best George Foreman so far. I love the removeable plates. They make cleanup so much easier. The only thing I don't like about the grill is that there is no on/off switch. You must unplug the unit to turn it off. So keep working George, and you will have the perfect grill someday."
2,No frills George Foreman Grill,"Looking to replace my aging Nuwave Oven I bought the George Foreman Grill -- Wrong!!! The grill is hard to clean and you must wait for the darn thing to cool off before removing the heating grills; by that time the grease has hardened and trickled under the heating plates, ugh! It's okay for hamburgers but not for steaks. The grill won't sear the steak without cooking it to death. No timer on this one and it's very seldom used. All in all, it's a 'cheesey' addition to my cookware."
2,"Looks Good, Cooks Bad","This GRP4 grill :PROS: Looks good,cleans up easy.CONS: Cheap made, Cooks terrible to much cycle time between on and off, Don't like the grease catcher loose on counter-top. Do not Recommend!!Note: Returned this item after 2 uses. Ordered the Hamilton Beach 25285 grill. After 2 uses it is hands down the better product. Try it you'll like it."
3,George Foreman GRP4 Secpnd Generation,This device has no controls or timer therefore it has to be carefully watched. Read the description carefully and check to see if it is desirable.
3,Not hot enough,Cleaning the grill is quick and easy because the grill plates are removable.The only problem is the grill doesn't get hot enough and it won't sear the meat. Sometimes I even have to turn the meat over because the bottom grill plate doesn't seem to get as hot as the top.I think the grill temperature should be 50 or 75 degrees higher.
4,Great product for anyone that enjoys cooking,"This is a fantastic product for anyone who enjoys grilling and doesn't like to check the weather first, this is a year round grill. I've enjoyed using this product for many years but once the removable plates were added I'll will never not own one and I got rid of my outdoor grill."
3,This is tiny!,This grill can fit maybe one small sandwich. It's a lot smaller than what I had expected. I couldn't fit more than 1 chicken breast on it.
4,cleaning the g grill,"To clean all of georges grills , put a hot wet paper towel with a little soap on the grill. close lid. let sit for 15 minutes and scrubbing will be kept at a minimum"
3,not as good as i expected,"good size wise for grilling more than one thing but found the upper grate did not brown up whatever you cooked as well as the bottom one, maybe due to removability of plates"
3,Better and Not So Better,"My original GF single grill was very, very hard to clean. This GRP4 is very, very EASY to clean, thank you.True to the reviews this one heats up very slowly, so slowly that in much the same way as a charcoal bbq, you need to start heating it up long before you cook.I'm not sure if it ever gets hot enough to sear a steak but the easy disassemble, easy to clean feature is appreciated."
1,Original grill is better and cheaper,I loved the original Foreman grill. When the nonstick coating wore off the plates the grill became extremely difficult to clean. I expected the Next Grilleration to perform as well as the original but with the added advantage of removable plates. This was not the case; the plates took a long time to reach grilling temperature and were not able to maintain this temperature when the meat was grilling. The meat steamed more than grilled.I returned the grill and replaced it with a first generation George Forman. I am now very satisfied!
5,Much better than previous Foreman grills,"I had a standard Foreman grill for about a year, and never used. When I did use it, it sat on the counter for days because cleaning it was such a pain in the neck.I got this grill about a year ago and use it all the time. The removable plates make this an indispensable tool. When you are done cooking, just toss the plates into the dishwasher.I also have some feedback after using it for a year. I actually wash mine in the sink more often than in the dishwasher because it is so easy to do. I do recommend stocking up on the George Forman sponges because they only last a month or two, and they work much better than anything else I have found.I have had some Teflon come off the bottom plate, but not enough to make me upset. 2 or 3 small scratches, and 2 holes about half the diameter of a pencil. In fairness, the holes are on top of small bumps which are the contact point between the 2 plates.Overall I am very happy with this, and would recommend it to anyone."
3,A little disappointed,"The plates aren't that heavy, and it doesn't get as hot as the original, so the meat doesn't get as browned and seared. But the removeable plates are nice for clean-up."
2,Don't waste a good steak in it!!!,"This product is a big disappointment. The other reviewer hit the nail when they said it does not get hot enough to sear meat. It's a trade-off for sure -- you better decide whether you want ""easy to clean"" or ""good to eat""."
2,Non stick coating comes off,"I bought my grill about 6 months ago and it was working great. I liked it so much better than my old grill that didn't have the removable plates. At first it was very easy to wash the plates in the sink. Eventually it started getting harder to get the plates clean even though I washed them right away. Tonight I was washing them and the non stick coating was starting to bubble up and big flakes of the non stick coating started to come off. At first I thought it was something that got burnt on the plate, but now I see that it's actually the coating that came off.This is the second time I had a problem with the coating come off a GF grill. It came off my first one, but only a tiny bit on the nubby parts that were raised up, but nothing like this.I contacted the company and I'm waiting to hear what they say. No way that the coating should have come off like that considering I used the special scrubby to wash it."
4,"George, the next generation","Well we have had the old george for about 5 years now and loved it, and the one thing we hated about it was washing it, so we wanted the removeable parts to throw in the dishwasher, that part i LOVE about this machine. What i dont LOVE , is that it doenst get terribly hot, so the food needs to be eaten directly from the machine or its cold in no time. I was hoping i could fit more on it LOL so i guess maybe a little bigger one would have been nice. There are more Geroge's to pick from but i don't think amazon has them all, but all in all, this is a good choice for the money, its easy to use, delicios and healthy and the ease of cleaning REALY make it the 4 stars!!"
2,"Doesn't heat well, top doesn't lock into place","Bought this as a gift for a family member. After a few uses I had a similar experience to other reviewers. A few chicken breasts we tried didn't heat well, and were tough on the outside. Same on repeated attempts. It was also difficult to lock the top plate into place. When a coworker said they wanted one we just gave it to her, and she's had better luck. I think I would rather stick with using an outdoor grill, or a broiler if that's not available."
5,Works great and so easy to clean!,I am impressed by this little dude! Grills very well on both sides and is so incredibly easy to clean. I'm happy with it. :)
1,Meat Sticks to the Grill,I have been using Geo. Foreman grilling machine since they came out. I have noticed that the teflon coating quality is is bad. Hamburgers stuck on the first use. The Non Stick Teflon does not work. I am so disapointed that the quality of this product is soooo bad.I took it back and got another one from a different store same problem.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
4,"Good for the price, but...","This grill is my second one from G.Forman - and in general I knew that I was buying a solid piece of machine. Unfortunatelyit has some cons, such as:- lack of any regulations in terms of power - it grills very quick - sometimes too quick- the upper plate is definitely hotter than the lower one therefore you have to watch your steaks, because they can easily become overgrilled from one side.- the device was supposed to ""knock out fat"" It does it just because you don't use oil, but the fat from the meat rather stays in it than goes down to the little plastic drain. Maybe I will try putting it in a different position with a different angle and it will eventually go down.Now what's good about it:+ it doesn't take much space but at the same time you can easily cook few things on it+ price+ removable plates are really great and easy to clean I just put them in a dishwasher.+ it does the jobIn general it could be a little bit better but for the price it is still a good buy."
3,"Caution, items on Internet are smaller than they appear","Wow, this thing looked huge in the picture. When it arrived it was tiny! We could barely fit 2 burger patties on it. As a grill, it works just like you'd expect, no complaints there. But if you think you'll be able to cook dinner for two on it, you're mistaken. It will probably fit everything you need for dinner for one, so if you're single, go for it. A couple will need 2 and a family will have to eat in shifts."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype.,"I was excited to get my grill as a gift having had it on my wish list for a while. I anticipated great meals from the great reviews I read. Well, no more. Despite having read (and followed) the directions and cleaning the plates after each use (in the dishwasher), everything scorches before the inside is even cooked. Last time I tried using non-stick spray but that only made the problem worse. As other reviewers have noted my top plate is worse than the bottom but if I flip the food then both sides ended up an ugly black. So much for the hype on this one!"
5,Great product,We LOVE the George Foreman grill. How handy whether in a hurry or not for just the two of us.
3,How do you grill cheese on this?,"Like the removable plate. One reason I bought this is because the information said ""even makes grilled cheese"".We don't eat meat and that was one of the uses we wanted it for. Unfortunately nowhere does it say how tomake grilled cheese with it. Tried a few times but the cheese melted all over the grill. Called customer service but the man there had no idea how to make it but did suggest using a half and no more than one slice of cheese. The products is very nice but don't think they should advertise that it grills cheese without explaining how."
3,George Foreman GRP4P Grill,"The grill itself works very well. It cooks quickly. Clean-up is easy. However, while unpacking the grill upon receiving it, the grill slid out of my hands and fell back into the box from approximately 12"" high, landing on a side handle, and breaking it. I was able to use super glue to re-attach the broken piece. But this incident made me feel that the quality of the product material was not very strong."
2,It's Ok,"After making this purchase, I found the Hamilton Beach Meal Maker grill that is bigger and about half the price.You decide."
3,Not nearly as nice as the earlier ones,"I just bought this grill as I love the little one I have, but wanted one a little bigger and the ""removeable plates"" idea really appealed to me. I figured you could pop them into dishwater while you're eating and a cinch to take care of. First, there's no timer on this grill, which is a feature I dearly love on my smaller one. Second the removable plates aren't all they're cracked up to be. It takes too long to pre heat and because it doesn't get as hot, it takes longer to cook the food, which results in the food not tasting as well. I ended up getting the GR26TMR model, which is family size with a timer and plates the same as the original. Absolutely fantastic!! This one still only takes 5 minutes to pre-heat & cooks your food in the same amount of time as the smaller one. As for cleaning, throw some wet paper towels on it & close the lid. By the time you finish your dinner it's practically cleaned itself."
2,sucker punch'd,I bought this to replace a 3yr old Sunbeam I got from Walmart for $15-which worked GREAT -the convenience of removable plates are obviously a trade off for heating effectiveness-it takes forever to pre-heat & doesn't keep the heat as well once cooking begins-I guess it's ok for a quick steam for chicken or veggies BUT definitely not a good sear for a steak-the ridges are anemic -back to Walmart!
5,GREAT GRILL!,"Cooks food in no time! I have found that food generally cooks in even less time than the Instruction Booklet chart indicates. The food is juicy and tender. And the run-off grease pan is great for helping the waistline! I like the fact that there is no ""On-Off"" switch -- just plug-in or unplug. The non-stick removable plates are fantastic. Easy to insert and remove. I do find that soaking them for a few minutes does help to make clean-up a bit easier. I usually soak them while they're too hot to clean right away, anyway, so it doesn't take me any more time. It's a nice looking grill, as well. Very streamlined."
5,This is wonderful,I haven't seen another grill I would have preferred. The grill easily comes out for cleaning. A feature not seen in most indoor grills.........
5,love,This grill is a MUST have for anyone who wants to cook healthy or just quick. Either/Or works with this grill! This is a great product and really easy to clean. I have used it for the passed 3 months and really regret not ordering it much sooner!I was so satisfied with this product that I plan on ordering more of them for family members!
5,George Foreman,I love my George Foreman grill! It was a great investment especially if you don't have an outside grill. Takes hardly any time to heat up and cook! Great product!!
4,Great Product,I am well pleased with this product. I owned one many years ago but hated cleaning it. The removeable plates are Amazing! I would recommend it!!!
4,Careful washing!,"The grill seems a bit hot - using recommended temps, pork chops were dry and fish fell apart when we opened the grill. I think Canola Oil here seems required - not a spray but wiping before cooking with a paper towel. We decided to wash plates by hand but be careful (put something soft down in your sink) because I have permanent scratches in my stainless steel sink where they rubbed when my husband was washing them. My GE dishwasher doesn't do a very good job with ""stuck on"" things."
2,Needs to be MUCH Hotter,"I owned a first generation GF Grill... although it was a PAIN to clean, it cooked reasonably well - top and botom. Once it broke, I bought a GF Next Grilleration model with removable grilling plates. The first time we used it, it was an extreme disappointment. Fearing that we had not done something right, we read the 'book' and tried it a few times more - same results... the grill does NOT get hot and any food cooked on it .. is terrible, to be kind. The bottom gets hotter, but still not enough and the top NEVER gets anything but luke at best... constant turning to get a bad result - DON't BUY! .. or you can have mine for the shipping cost."
3,finally easier to clean!,"definite improvement with the removeable plates for easier cleaning. Temp control is just ""OK"" you really need to watch your food since there is no control. i never got one of these things because it was difficult to clean, now i use it every now and then when the weather isn't great to grill outside."
1,Piece of junk,Do not buy. Cheap quality. Made in China. Removable plates would not reattach after removing them grill. This George Foreman grill is not made by Salton the original company that made the first grills.
2,Just doesn't get it,"I bought my grill after several friends and relatives raved about how well it cooks and how easy it is to use. Well, it is easy to use and easy to clean. And I guess you could say it cooks. But it just doesn't get hot enough to call it a grill, no matter how long you preheat it. You get no carmelization of the outside of food, no brown crunch, no grill lines. The food is cooked but there's no ""umph"" to it. I've had to take the grilled food and throw it in a frying pan to brown it and make it appealing enough to serve. I'm very disappointed and use mine less and less often. In fact, I'm thinking it will probably be making an appearance at my next garage sale."
