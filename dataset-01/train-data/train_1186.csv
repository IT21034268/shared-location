5,Maid to order,It was just as was described. It was great came quick in the mail. I would have no problem buying from this person again.
2,Wretched transfer!,"Maid to Order, while an entertaining film (definitely not great, but good enough to entertain), suffers drastically from a terrible transfer. Call it ""Lionsgate Syndrome."" The studio dredges out this film from their vast resevoir, a film in slight demand from a sentimental audience (I do love the 80's), and just-well, transfers it. No clean-up whatsoever. The original film stock in all of its grainy, fuzzy-looking glory are presented here, available for public purchase for the first time on DVD (as of 2002).The fact that it's available on DVD is obviously not to amass consumer respect, but rather to make a speedy dollar; there are no extras (not even a film trailer!), no actor biographies, no movie stills, none of the cheap-o extras one expects from a cheap DVD-just the badly transferred movie. Allow me to reiterate this: all you get is a badly transferred movie. It's VHS quality on DVD. Scrap it."
5,Wonderful movie but overpriced due to rarity of DVD,"Ally Sheedy is wonderful in this feel good movie. Also you should appreciate the singing by Merry Clayton on ""I Can Still Shine"". She is an amazing vocalist with an amazing history/look her up in Wikipedia. OK, one problem with the movie, as I write this, the DVD is out of production. $52 new or $20 used is too much for the DVD. Powers that be....Can we get this cleaned up and reissued at a reasonable price please???"
2,VCR tape was better quality,"The disk has major drop out, poor sound quality and is blury. My VCR Tape is much better quality. I was dissapointed."
2,not an exact fit for the PSP,"I bought the case thinking it will be great to have a metal shell encasing the $250 game unit. The case look pretty cheap, but the biggest turn off for me is that the case leaves too much room inside so the PSP will slide around and possibly get scratched. ALso there is not enough room to put anything else inside, yet there is all that extra space. Not cool."
1,Get something else,"This case has a 'pocket' in the lid made out of some material that I worry would scratch the PSP screen. Also noteworthy is the case doesn't really leave enough room for the wrist strap if you have it attached to the PSP - it will fit, but somewhat forcefully."
2,PSP case,"the item picture seems to convey the fact that the case will form-fit the PSP, so as to keep it from moving around. this is not true. the interior is spartan and has two clips that secure the PSP from motion, however, once put inside the case a little jiggle reveals that the PSP will move about. i have placed a piece of soft thin flannel on the interior and fold the edges of the cloth over the PSP before closing. also the hori screen protector seem to be a mandatory accessory."
2,Good but could be better,"I got this case with the need of protecting my PSP. The first thing I niticed was the mesh, and I did not like that pressed against the screen. To remedy this I folded the cleaning cloth over the pocket to protect the screen. Other than that it is an OK case as long as you store a umd in the mesh area to keep the PSP snug and in place. (ONLY PUT 2 UMD's in the mesh part, Doubling them up to store 4 will put excess pressure on the Screen.) Im sure you can find a camera bag that will work better but this seems to be ok till something nicer comes out.This case will hold 3UMD's (4 counting the one in the PSP), cleaning clothand your earbuds allong with the PSP.All in all this is more of a replica of their case for the Nintendo DS."
4,"This case is ""safe""","Allright, this case is for good protection. When closed, it give no acess to it whatsover, and completely sheilds it from dropping it. You can easily store one umd in the little cut out below where the psp itself stays, and also, the mesh in the above could hold a variety of things, like the earphones, or more umds. The mesh wouldnt scratch your psp screen unless you really overloaded it with a bunch of stuff (charger car keys ect), and the can also be propped up a little in the case itslef for movie veiwing. Also, there is a long strap the comes with it. Overall this case IS good. I bought mine in a store today, and wanted to share my experiences with everyone else.(out of *****)PROTECTION: *****STYLE: ****DURABILITY: *****USEFULLNESS: ****"
5,Great little guide,"After reading in Time Out Chicago that Ms. Blumberg was going to be signing her book at a local tea house I thought it might be a good way to learn a little about something I know nothing about. What a wonderful little guide book! While somewhat slim, it's chock full of useful info. I also purchased a copy for some relatives of ours that visit frequently. And in fact I think I'll buy a few more to give out to guests. As tea becomes more popular I'll look forward to Volume II!"
5,Fisher-Price Smart Cycle,I have bought two of these for my grandsons that are 3. They are wonderful educational toys . I recommend it highly. So do their parents.
3,NO A/C adapter?!?!?!,"I liked this SmartCycle until I saw that it didn't have the capability to plug an A/C adapter. There is no way that I'm buying 4 ""d"" batteries all the time because my 3 yr old doesn't understand turning it off means leaving it off. I'm glad i bought it here and not retail. I'd be even more aggrevated if I paid full price. Now, he'll he using this for exercise while watching any of his Disney movies."
4,Fisher Price Smart Cycle,Our 3 year old grandson loves this game. We had to put a time limit on it or he'd stay on for an hour.
3,"Delay, since this gift didn't arrive with batteries or the option to also send","It would have been much more helpful to have clear knowledge of the need for batteries, so that this Christmas gift arrived ready to use. Otherwise, fun for indoor winter exercise."
5,Awesome education and exercise!,"This was a present for my son and daughter ages 3 and 5 and they both LOVE it! Not only do they love it, so do my 8 and 10 year old boys who sit on the ground, pedaling it with their hands to play against each other! Fun for the whole family for only $50! I can't think of another video game they can get so much exercise with!"
3,Didn't love it as much as I'd hoped.,"I thought my son was going to be crazy over this, and he so wasn't. However, the Diego game did save the day.Parents may not want to invest if your child is over 4, however the combo of the physical activity (no resistance on pedals at all though), with thinking skills is nice."
3,"Needs better pedals, and an electrical plug.","My kids enjoy this game, but they have already worn out the pedals. I've been to the hardware store to buy replacement bolts, but with less than perfect results. Also, I'm surprised there's not an electrical plug. We've gone through lots of batteries."
5,Everything but the safety helmet!!,"I bought this for my niece who isn't quite three yet, but is quite advanced in speech and problem solving. I was concerned that it might be too big for her (an average size 33 month baby). But she fits on it fine, and loves it! After her daddy set it up, she ran to her bedroom to get her bike helmet before climbing on for a spin! I don't think she quite gets the video game part, but enjoys the heck out of riding her bike."
2,"Not at all durable, too costly for what it gives, only reason to buy is kids can get some excercise","This product is kind of waste, except for the fact that kids get some excercise. Too expensive and no durability. Compared to similar educational toys, especially V-tech V-smile motion, games aren't that educative and interesting. Less number of games available, and they are costlier than V-smile games.I got this Feb 2009 for my kid, before mar 15 the right pedal is broken, it lost its threads. We have to throw it. Wasted money on this toy. Though my 3yr old son was very much obcessed to this toy, he was disappointed as the pedal is broken."
3,Stupid Oversight,"Only just got the toy today as a birthday present for my 2 year old - who is already fighting with the 3 1/2 year old over it. (We expected that.) But the stupidest oversight on the part of the designers, was that the on/off switch is within reach of the rider - right next to the operating buttons and shifter, in fact. So of course BOTH my kids cannot stop just switching it on and ff constantly. It's making me nuts already. Why couldn't they have put that switch on the back or on the front - out of reach while riding?!"
3,Disappointed Rider,"My 4 year gets very bored when he rides the Smart Cycle. He doesn't last more than 10 minutes on it. We have had this toy for almost a year now, and I don't think he has played with it more than a dozen times. This is definetely not an excercise toy due to the fact it has no resistance when the child rides the toy. Also, the Smart Cycle runs through batteries. I had to go buy rechargable batteries. Finally, we own 3 different games, but they seem to have the same concept except with different characters. With all the technology available, I think Fisher Price could of made this toy more fun!"
2,it's an ok toy,Fisher-Price Smart CycleMy son got this toy for christmas. The first few days it worked great but then it started shuting of and some times would not even turn on. It seems like the wire connection was not working. Also it only takes batteries which should be a BIG NO NO in kids toys. All the toy makers should know by now that you have to have a plug addapter. who wants to go through all those batteries. If your child forgets to turn it off ( which most will) then the batteries don't last but a few times. It a big flaw. They could have done a much better job in the design overall.
4,how to start the smart cycle..,"I am writing this in the hopes it may save some others frustration. I bought a smart cycle, brought it home and set it up. When i switched it to on, nothing happened. I followed the directions perfectly, nothing. Checked the batteries and wiring, all good. Eventually I brought it back and got another, same problem. Only later did I find out I had to turn it on initially by holding down both handle bar buttons for a few seconds. After that, it would turn on and off normally with the power button. THIS IS MENTIONED NOWHERE IN THE MANUAL, and had I not lucked out and just tried it, I would have wasted time exchanging it for a third cycle, as neither responded to just the power button.Overall, it's ok. I agree with others that it is marketed as an exercise-as-you-play toy, but only the two or so racing games require pedaling. All the others you just use the joystick and its not too comfortable"
5,Still holds interest,"My two little boys (aged 4.5 and 6) love this toy. After a year, they still play with it. To me, that makes it well worth the money. Both boys know how to hook it up to the television and insert the games. It can be difficult for the little ones to know that they've fully inserted the game. My six year old has a form of autism and some sensory issues. He gets good sensory input from cycling. I've found that learning while doing a form of gross motor activity seems to be helpful in retaining what is being learned. That's just an added bonus. We're looking forward to adding some new games this year!"
2,Waste of money.,"The SmartCycle was on the top of my 3 year old's Christmas list shortly after they were introduced by Fisher Price.While we haven't had any real problems with it, I'm still left feeling as though it was a waste of money. The graphics are terrible, and gameplay is slow and much more simple than initially expected. And, as other reviewers have mentioned, the lack of ability to actually save progress on games played makes for frustrating repetition.Over the past 9 months my son has probably played with this toy about 5 times, at no more than 15 minutes each.I can definitely see where some children would actually enjoy this bike, but it seems to be more of a novelty than anything."
1,Greatly Dissapointed,THis toy must have Battereis to operate. IT did not work out of the box and customer service had to be notified. It was a real pain by the time we were finished --Not worth the trouble
3,Could be great but have to work out kinks.,"My 3-year-old loved this toy as a Christmas present. She rode it often!! The problem was by March a pedal had broken off from a stripped thread. We had it welded back on, as my child loved this toy, and then the other broke off!These bikes get plenty of ride time and need to be made of as tough stuff as our kids are.Also the battery thing, it should either come with a chargeable set or be a plug-in. Although the battery life is good for regular play.The bike is absolutely wonderful and exciting for my child. Keeping her busy during the cold winter months. Some tweaks from Fisher-Price is necessary.Fisher-Price toys however have been great and durable in our past buying experiences. Pedals need not to strip after only a few months though."
2,Some major flaws!!,"I don't think I would waste my money again. It does go through batteries extremely quickly and it is difficult to make sure your 3 year old always turns it off. It does frequently ""freeze up"", which is very frustrating. The pedals rotate loosely (not enough resistance), so it has been difficult for my 3 year old to control.For $100, I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Not quite what I wanted it to be,"First off, my boy (4) was so excited to get this for Christmas. He loves playing with it and has never complained. I on the other hand......don't like that he can leave it on and kill the batteries. We have yet to wear out all those D batteries through continued use. It always happens that the cycle gets left on and eats the batteries....can't believe that there are no more games. There were a handful of games available when we bought the thing and apparently no new ones have come out since. I wonder how much it matters, though, since most games are basically the same. They're different enough that my son enjoys some more than others, but they are in large part all the same.Overall I think it has been a success, but the battery issue and the lack of variety of software makes me think much less of this toy than I did when we bought it."
5,Needs another power source!,This has been a very fun educational toy for my grandson. After changing batteries three times in one month I think there should be an automatic shut off or another power source for the cycle. I like the fact that it encourages children to be active while playing video games.
3,"Fun, not addicting like other video game but wastes batteries","We bought this for our 5 year old and 2-1/2 year old girls and they really like it. The games are fun and it helps them get their exercise. I do not like it because it doesn't have automatic shut off and it uses batteries. So, if someone forgets to shut if off, you will need to change the batteries. This is expensive, let alone harmful to our environment. There is no reason why it should not have an ac adapter option. So anyway, we have had this for 3 weeks now, and it has not been touched for at least 2 because it ran out of batteries when one of the kids left it on. The good thing about it is that they have to petal for most of the games, so they get tired and do not want to play with it all day. And if they don't have to petal, they do not want to sit on that seat for too long, so it serves the same purpose."
3,You dont need to pedal!! ;-(,"My wife and I bought this toy for our son thinking that the concept was great. What better way to combine learning, fun and exercise.However once my son started playing this game it became clear that there were portions of the game where you did not have to pedal. It ended up that those were the games that my son ended up playing. This toy ends up becoming a low grade video game machine where he plays in a bad sitting position and does not get the exercise. We were pretty disappointed. I am not sure if all of the cartridges have ""no pedal"" games on them."
5,SMART CYCLE VS GRANDSONS,WE PUT HIM ON AND IN TWO HOURS IN WAS AMAZING HOW MUCH HE HAD TAKEN IN!! But if you are buying sight unseen....please know that they will need 4 d batteries......my grandson was quite perturbed with mistake.
4,For All Parents of Preschoolers,"My 4.5 year old boy needs a little more resistance than the pedals give. He likes to push hard and def. makes the pedals work hard. One of the pedals fell off after 2 months of use, but easily fixable. He not always chooses the most educational programs but at least he is being physically challenged while watching TV. He is addicted to TV, like most kids, so this was a great middle ground for us. I also like the fact that he has learned how to use it himself so his technological skills are being utilized. It was worth the purchase and I feel 4-5 is the perfect age. It is def. too complex for my 2.5 year old. It was relatively easy to put together. I would recommend this to all parents of preschoolers."
4,Good but needs to be able to be plugged in,"We've only had this for a couple of months and my 3 yr old son likes to play it when we have batteries. The problem is that 3 yr olds like to push buttons and move switches, so he's always walking by and turning it on so when he wants to play with it, the batteries are dead. Too bad you can't plug it into the wall for power."
3,"Great exercise, absolute fun, poor replay value","Our four year old son loves his Smart Cycle. He doesn't learn anything new from it but it does reinforce his numbers, letters, and shapes. The toy sits in the middle of the living room and he will sometimes just get on it and pedal away without turning it on. He hasn't played with it roughly but it does seem very sturdy and kid resilient.Our boy has a lot of fun on it but it is waning. The only complaint- and it is an outstanding one- is that the user has to play through the beginning of the game to get to the later stages. There is no way to save the progress made, no way to go directly to the other challenges.The later stages could be fantastanomically full of learning and exciting gameplay and we just don't know about it. This toy is great fun but the flaw kills a lot of the replay value."
1,PIECE OF CRAP,"My son loves this toy. It is fun for him to play with and easy enough to set up himself.BUT.We are on our THIRD SmartCycle. The first one, the pedals did not work directly out of the box. The second one worked for 2 days, then when we turned it on, it was just white lines across a screen. The games wouldn't load at all. I'm pissed that in less than a week I've had to replace it twice. Plus, the graphics suck, the games are expensive and most of all... IT IS A GIANT PIECE OF CRAP!!!! Don't buy this unless you are ok exchanging it 14 times."
4,Great Educational Toy,The grandson loves this product and plays with it more than anything else he received from santa.
4,Years of fun,"My father-in-law bought the Smart Cycle for my daughter for her 5th birthday. I thought she would outgrow it in no time. It's now a year and a half later and we are still pulling it out and plugging it up at least once a week. We've never had any problems with the wiring or the pedals like some of the other reviewers have. To keep it interesting, we've had to invest in numerous cartridges. The educational value is excellent, although easy for my daughter who is in 1st grade. It's definitely geared more for the pre-school set. All-in-all, a great purchase."
1,"Nice, but has Fatal Flaws","We purchased this for our son for Christmas, as he is physically 8, but mentally about 4-5. He simply has not had much opportunity to enjoy it, as the batteries only last about 1 day. I refuse to keep buying batteries so we are trying to decide whether to pass the problem on to someone else, or wield a soldering iron and add an AC power adapter.The gameplay itself is not really that stellar either. We were not expecting PS3 or XBox type video, but perhaps close to PS2 or Wii quality. We purchased two games and the graphics are really blocky, worse than I remember from the game systems from my childhood even.On a positive note I'm glad they used cartridges instead of DVD's, as small kids destroy them really quickly.I believe they should have built this as a controller for a better system, such as the wii or even the older PS2. I love the idea of combining exercise with gameplay, but not sure this is it."
3,could be much better,"okay, but graphics are very poor quality and especially in an age when they are used to Wii/Xbox360/Ps3 they notice. My 6 year old won't use it and my 3 year old does, but only a little. He can't recognize key details (road signs pointing to the exit) due to the poor graphics quality, so he plays for 10 monutes and stops. It is also repetitive - buy 1 or 2 cartridges and you are set, they all seem to be the same."
4,Great Fun,"Got this as a Christmas gift for my three-year-old son. I can't keep him or my seven-year-olkd off of it! In addition to the game it comes with, he got the Hot Wheels cartridge, which of course, is a hit with a little boy! Some assembly was required, which I didn't know ahead of time, but it was pretty light. Nothing more than a phillips screw driver. Already, his recognition of alphabets has gotten a lot better!"
4,Best Christmas Present!,We bought the Smart Cycle for our 3 1/2 year old little boy who is extremely active. He absolutely loved it and can work the entire system himself (after a week of practice). We bought a battery charger and rechargable batteries after reading reviews suggesting this. We haven't had to change batteries yet. I think the key is teaching your child to turn the bike off any time they get off. We are very happy with our purchase!
4,smart cycle,"this toy is just great...we got it for our 3 yr old. she is a bit small for her age so it is a bit difficult for her to reach the pedals but my other two daughters ages 4 & 6 absolutely love it and for those children who do not know how to ride a bike it is great training. we have only tried two games, the one it came with and a dora game and both are fun for the kids and it also helps encourage hand eye coordination. overall i think this is a great toy. my girls will enjoy this for years and years to come...and the games cover all ages in my home which is great. although for a 3 yr old this toy might be a little advanced but once they get the whole pedal and look at the tv instead of your feet thing down it is a great learning tool that is fun too...."
1,Another Poor Quality Fisher Price Product,This toy did not work. Imagine this is the big gift for your 3 year olds xmas and plugging it in only produced a half yellow and half black screen. Well that's what happened to me with this piece of crap toy. I know that those are strong words but FP should be ashamed of themselves. This is the 3rd year I have purchased a FP toy that was defective at best and at worst they could have injured my children (last xmas the play 'n learn piano overheated and scorched my daughters pajama pants and the prior xmas I had batteries explode in my son's baby swing).
1,What a waste of money,"Our son received this for Christmas. From the start it was obvious that it had wiring issues. We never could get a clear picture. We returned it to a major retailer and exhanged it for another one. We get the second one home, assemble it and we couldn't even get the piece of junk to turn on. What a waste of time and energy. I do not recommend this product at all."
4,please exchange it!!,"I got this smart cycle for my daughter's birthday adn she loves it though, when she drives about 5minuts,Screen on the TV get wabbly and runs border lines, sometimes screen get so messy and I can 't see the proper screen. it was torn box with new smart cycle inside though, looks like broken toy came from mail order...I am so disappointed. is there somehow can I exchange or refound? I try to blow the dust and clean the cartrige, check the connections and change TV, but I am quite sure now, I got broken smart cycle...please exchange it!!"
5,smart cycle,"I purchased this item for my 3 year old grandson for Christmas. We haven't used it yet, but I'm very hopeful he'll love it. When we received it, we opened it just to make sure everything was there. There was no instruction manual. I contacted the Crazy Pirate, where we purchased it and they sent the instruction booklet out to us. They were very courteous and helpful."
2,Pedal falls off every time my son tries to use it!,"My son is a slow learner-he keeps trying to use this toy even though it breaks EVERY time he tries to ride it. The petal falls off every time. I ordered a new pedal (at my expense) but that one falls off also. I thought it was installer error so I had a more fix-it handy person reinstall it. Still broke off. Would not buy it again. If it didn't break, could be a good toy but can't tell since it keeps breaking!"
2,Nice idea but very poorly made...,"I bought this for my two grandsons, ages 4 & 6, for Christmas last year. The concept is a great one but needs electrical hookup. But for me the deal breaker was that it really needs to be made more durable. It didn't last but two weeks and fell apart. They did not mind repeating the games which helped to build their confidence as they mastered more and more. But it would have been nice if they could of had their own names and scores like a lot of the other software has that's out there. Like I said ... GREAT CONCEPT but lacking in durability."
4,Exercise and Fun,My daughter thoroughly enjoys the Smart Cycle. She has spent hours on this bike pedaling as if she were going somewhere. I have enjoyed the hours of constructively occupied time my daughter has been dedicating to completing each video game. She loves this toy and because of the fact that the toy combines exercise with video games it is the only video game I have allowed into the house. She has also improved in her ability to ride her bike and this I would also attribute to the hours on the Smart Cycle developing her muscles. :)
4,Best game ever,My Granddaughter is 4 years old and loves her cycle and all the games. It is also teaching her cordination with the peddling and steering. I recommend it.
1,Fun while it lasts!,RIP OFF. I have purchased two of these smart cycles. The first one my son was too young and it was year before he could use it.(my fault) He used it 3 or 4 times and then the games stopped working. I changed batteries and nothing helped. You could hear the game but not see it. I read some reviews that the electrical wiring sometimes messed up.Also the peddles kept coming off. Since I had it for a year there was nothing I could do. I bought another and he used it for about a month and the pedals kept coming off again. Now we have lost the screw on one and stripped the screw on the other. Guess I could make some pedals out of duct tape. I am out $250 for a cycle that my son loves but cant use. They know the pedals are a problem and they have not fixed them.UPDATE: I bought my kid a Nintendo DSi and he loves it only $120 plus some games of course. Should have bought this to begin with since they even have educational games for little kids.
2,Not suited for all 3 year olds,"I purchased this smart-cycle last night for my son, who is an older 3 year-old (turns 4 in May). The box states ages 3-6, so I figured he was old enough to use it. After I put the cycle together, we found he could not reach the pedals (at the highest adjustment). My son is on the smaller side, but his feet are at least 5-6 inches away. Needless to say, I had to tape some of his blocks to the pedals.Another issue we have encountered is the key (game)- every time he bumps against it the game turns off.Suggestions for Fisher-Price-Allow for the pedals to adjust (not just the seat)-Somehow design the seat to adjust even closer to the pedals-Make the handle bars adjust according to the seat/pedal adjustmentSuggestions for Parents-If you have smaller children wait until they grow some more, or....-Tape some blocks on the pedals :-)"
1,What a turd!,"Batteries really? How stupid are the people at Fischer Price? It's going to cost me a fortune to run this thing. Also, huge flaw ... The joystick doesn't even work. Never did. We can't maneuver through the game whatsoever. Also, the graphics are straight from the atari 2600 I used as a kid. Just terrible! I highly recommend passing on this gift. Great idea for a toy. Horrible execution! Bunch of idiots at FP!"
2,Smart cycle,"I bought this cycle for my grandson. He enjoyed it for a while. Then went to order new games and when he got them they were for the newer model. It said on the games that they were for this cycle, but when opened they would not work unless I bought the new model. It was misleading"
2,my grandsons favorite,"I am so disappointed. I bought this in advance of sales for Christmas for full price of nearly 130 dollars. We began using it at Christmas (now on sale at walmart for 30 dollars), and already the ""keys"" to be plugged in to the side no longer work. I know he is a boy, and can be rough, but he barely ever used this aspect of the toy. We did it for him. Useless. Do not waste your money. Concept is awesome but not durable at all"
2,Poorly Built,"As with the other reviews, my son 4 absolutely loved this toy...while it worked anyway. The screws that connect the petals are slightly too small and there is no washer on the other end. This being the reason for the petals continually falling off. Also the game has a tendency to short out occasionally and just turn off. Very frustrating for the children. And then there is the whole D battery issue. Lame design for sure. Put your money somewhere else. If you are going to spend this much on a machine for exercise for the kids just put out the extra hundie for a Wii or go with the V-Motion for less."
4,A Great Gift Idea,I bought this gift recently for my daughter's 5th birthday. She LOVES it and has been using it everyday since she opened it. I love the fact that it incorporates excercise with learning. I also love that the games are age appropriate and I can control what games she is playing unlike internet games. We live in the desert so when it's 112 here she will have something fun to play and ride a bike indoors! I highly recommend it.
2,Not well thought out.,"I am writing this after having the SmartCycle for 1 year. I felt it was important to voice my opinion after the thousanth time changing batteries, and my general frustration over this product. We have already had to have one replaced from the joystick not functioning properly after 1 month of use. The graphics are poor considering the posibilities in this era,and with all of the other posts of frustrations, (not being able to save games, players etc.)I would not recommend this product."
1,power system failed completely with very little use,"We used this thing about 3 times, during which it ate through 2 sets of D batteries. THen it would not turn on at all. What a waste of effort, materials, labor, shipping. Of course now it's been more than 30days so Amazon won't take it back. This is why the world is awash in garbage!"
3,No Wheels!!! No People!!! Just bricks and plates.,Bought this hoping to get my niece and nephew started. There are no lego figures or wheels so making moving cars will have to wait for another lego set purchase. Wish there was a picture of the contents.
5,Legos,"This bin contains 1000 Legos(Legos are VERY fun and safe!!). If your child likes building Bionicles, Star Wars, Clickits etc. then they will like this! Legos are also very educational. They teach kids to use their imaginations. But, if your child is under the age of about 4, dont worry! There are also bins containing Duplos, and Quatros, wich are made for youner children(they are like Legos only bigger). Legos make a great gift."
2,"Seven Hundred and Ninety-five Dollars and eighty-six cents. Take it away, Seth and Amy","I mean, REALLY?!?! That's almost eight dollars per piece, yet otherwise, I've never seen a brick collection on this site during this year that averages more than a dime apiece (LEGO regular generally averages six to about ten cents per piece; Megablok Micro, its rival in size, about 4.5 to 6 cents.)Is this a mistake, I hope? Or am I missing something fundamental?smalling_60626@yahoo.com"
3,Always a risk when buying used.,"The price of this unit was nearly $340.00 less than the original asking price...I discovered why. It appears all of the pieces are in there, but there are so many smaller pieces I would not be able to tell if any were missing, and I refuse to count it all. I did discover one piece that absolutely does not go with this set. Clearly, it belongs to another set. The worst part about this unit, IS THE SMELL! Previously used indeed. I had to empty the box, and take it outside to wash the grime away from the inside bottom, and some of the pieces too. Have you ever tried to clean a one or two-pronged Lego? It's a bitch. I don't think my five year old nephew is going to care when he gets this, but the thought horrifies me that he puts any of these pieces in his mouth, and who knows what kind of germs get injested. Overall, I will buy Legos brand new, in a sealed box next time."
4,If I Only Had It,"I am still waiting for this lego set to come. It's been on back order since November and I ordered it for my grandson for Christmas. I was excited to see its availability online, because I didn't see this set in any stores, but was disappointed to find out it was not going to come in time for the holidays. I am hoping it comes by the end of January as Amazon indicated. I'm sure it will be popular with my grandson, who loves to create."

3,Elegant looking but pricy.,"Fast shipping, pricy but elegant looking and very easy to install in a narrow space, the lighted button is very easy to see in the dark."
2,flaky button,"While this doorbell get high marks for its aesthetics, the button mechanism itself is unreliable...in about one in every four presses it becomes stuck in the 'in' position, causing your doorbell transformer to buzz angrily until you go press the doorbell button again to un-stick it. Sadly the quality of its insides doesn't match its nice facade."
2,contains dangerously incorrect information,I can't comment on the accuracy of the rest of the book as I haven't gotten to Wyoming yet but the safety information on bears does not distinguish between black and grizzly bears and is only correct for grizzly bears - for black bears it is TOTALLY WRONG and could get someone killed! (the same publisher's Hiking Montana book also contains the identical incorrect information)
4,not a rip off but not vital...,"I'm giving it 4 stars just because it means Hollywood Bowl is on DVD and, although the quality of it isn't stellar, considering how low-fi the original recording of it was, I'm not about to quibble about it. The interview is interesting since I didn't catch it on TV originally and, yes, I even like having ""Parrot Sketch Not Included"".But it's not vital unless you feel like being a completist. With the exception of the Hollywood Bowl show, it's not even a particularly good introduction to Python.But to spite all that, I like it."
3,"How are the German episode & ""Parrot"" live?","A&E continues their bizarre treatment of Python material once again. It's great to put together Hollywood Bowl and the Aspen reunion show to constitute a ""live"" title, but the German episode (which should have been on the lacking Life Of Python disc 2) and ""Parrot"" shouldn't even be on this set. Some Secret Policemen's Ball bits would have been more appropriate, but I'm sure there's a rights issue there. As for ""Parrot"": is it worth paying 2-disc price for clips you've seen and a 5-second gag of all 6 pythons from 1989? A&E should have taken the redundant clips off their Complete Series discs and just added the original bits from ""Parrot."" Oh well, I still bought it all anyway."
4,"Worth it, if only for the Hollywood bowl","An almost excellent collection of Python, the Hollywood Bowl segment being the best of the bunch.Some of it, decidedly isn't ""live"" however. (Insert dead parrot joke here.)"
4,Monty Python Live!,Wonderful Concert film of Monty Python at their height. Very nice movie and quite enjoyable. The skits are recognizable from the show and it is fun to see them doing the skits live!
2,Good Python but poor recording of live shows,"I have wanted this item since I first saw it back in the 80's but it is extremely difficult to find. When I saw it on sale as a DVD collection I pulled the trigger quickly. However, I was quickly disappointed. I had assumed that transferring the video to DVD would have been an improvement on the audio and video capabilities of the shows but I was wrong. And on a HD TV the poor quality of the recording really stands out. I really enjoy Python sketches but I found myself getting bored and frustrated with the actual quality of the media itself."
4,"Abridgement of ""Song of the Sky""","Readers be aware ""The World Aloft"" is an abridgement of ""Song of the Sky."" I own both books and use the paperbacked ""The World Aloft"" as a portable travel copy, since ""Song"" is a thick, heavy book. If you are unable to procure ""Song fo the Sky""; ""The World Aloft"" captures the essentials of the original book: treasure it and learn from Murchie."
2,Disappointed . . .,"The reviews of this book were generally favorable but after I finished reading it I was dissatisfied. The book is not a novel in the traditional sense; rather, it's a group of loosely connected short stories that add up to less than the sum of their parts. Boyd is a decent writer -- I have no complaints about her style -- but her book had almost no impact on me; when I was done with it, I had to go back and reread parts of it to refresh my memory of what I had read. Not a good sign for me of a memorable book."
2,LOST MY INTEREST,"There's nothing worse than a book that has you up until the end. Unfortunately this was one of those books. It was a good quirky novel, up until the last few chapters, when it just became a muddled mess. What was the point?! The book completely lost its focus, & I lost my interest. Blanche McRary Boyd forgot who her main character was & the book went downhill. All in all, a big buildup with an even bigger disappointment."
4,Love it,"The structure is a little wonky (it would have benefited from a more conventional plot arc), but the content is lovely. Specific, searing details, a voice that strikes a perfect balance between country hick and observant authoress, and insightful but non-preachy commentary on race, class, and gender."
5,One of my all time favs,i have run into people who have seen this movie or remember this movie and all you have to do is throw a line out and instantly you have a conversation started. this film has some of the funniest one liners. its hard to remember val kilmer before fame and fortune.One of my all time favs by far
5,Real Genius,"I am of the 60's generation, and this one just fits right in. Val Kilmer young but very likeable is great as the wise one. I have been waiting for this one to come out on DVD, I own the VHS version also. Have been a fan even with Top Secret, but this one is my favorite. The pranks they pull at colleges has not changed in years, and the reality of our government and how things are discovered are still true today. Great easy watching and love for popcorn....."
4,A cult classic,"The witticism come fast in furious.I've loved this since it's first release, while I was in college. It motivated me, and gave me some one-liners that I still use."
4,"quirky, funny movie about smart kids","This is a ""teen movie"" in that it follows the formula fairly closely, but the details are delightfully different. For one thing, it's about smart kids that actually act like smart kids (I can't think of another such movie offhand). For another, it's populated with characters that are distinct and memorable (I'm especially fond of the hyperactive girl). And finally, try to think of another movie where a character says ""radiatively coupled to the ground state"" and means it...This is a definite pick for smart teenagers, but I recommend it for adults as well."
4,Love this movie,"For the time period, with all of the 80's movies, this is an underrated gem. Funny, simple and easy to watch."
4,"""Good 80's Comedy!""","Val Kilmer and William Atherton star in this 1985 comedy.Two students learn that they're building a lazer weaponfor the military. I grew up wathing this and always likedit. It's nice to have it on dvd that has good picture andsound, but no extras. I recommend this good 80's flick."
3,Real Genius,"Val Kilmer is terrific in this early comedy, as he shows that he can play eccentric very well."
4,Good movie for the 80's nostalgist,"I remeber watching this movie in the 80's remebering it as Val Kilmers platform to stardom, I always wondered what happened to the little dude in the movie.Then sex and the city came out and everybody was talking about Sara Jessica Parker, I honestly think that little dude is a pre-op Sara Jessica Parker, the faces are identical! And where did that little guy go? So anyways I like this movie escecially for the popcorn scene at the end, but now I can't share any of my friend's ""fondness"" for Sara Jessica Parker. He's a She."
4,Good.,I really liked this movie starring Val Kilmer. I liked the characters in the movie most of all because they were mostly all likeable except for the evil guy. The story is he created a machine that can penetrate through basically anything and the teacher who is evil takes it to the government. My favorite part is when the beam hits his house and the huge thing of popcorn explodes in his house. I recommend this movie for the 1980sness to it.
3,Real Fun,"Real Genius is a funny mid 80's teen movie. It takes place at a California college where a group of exceptional students are working a laser beam. It appears to be purely for science, but ends up being part of secret government weapon. Val Kilmer stars as Chris Knight the top student and genius. Instead of being a geek, he is flip and off the wall. Mr. Kilmer gives an affable and likable performance. William Atherton plays yet another heavy and young Gabe Jarret gives a solid performance as a teenage genius and Mr. Kilmer's sidekick. The film is fun, but a paper thin plot holds it back."
4,"Genius of a film, but keep ad libs that follow the story","The cast is fine in this smart comedy where 15 year old Gabe Jarrett comes to college to participate in a science project, not knowing its director(William Atherton) is using it to develop a secret weapon for the government. This lazer weapon can hit a human target from outer space.I found some of the sexist humor to be distracting, i.e. one of the science students in the lab tells the other guys, ""Let's go, girls!"" and at the weapons testing site a female general commands attention from the brass who are running the project. Humor is welcome if it seems to have something to do with what is going on in the scene. Special effects and the hilarious popcorn scene were all worth watching again. Debbie Foreman from ""Valley Girl"" has a bit part and seems to have been taken off the major studio casting call list when she refused to wear a few less clothes."
3,ROFL,"This is one of those comedies like Airplane, Blazing Saddles, Naked Gun, Hot Shots, etc. that you need to at least see, but really should buy and add to your video library. I was happy to see this and the Val Kilmer comedies ""Top Secret"" and ""Willow"" come out on DVD."
5,REAL GENIUS IS A REAL TREAT!,"Most definatly a 5-star film. The quality of this DVD and my satisfaction easily warrant such high praise; A wonderful DVD to add to your collection of favorites. I just purchased this movie from Amazon.com and couldn't be more satisfied. Great '80s comedy staring young Val Kilmer as a brilliant student and mentor. If you were an '80s graduate, you will undoubtedly enjoy this film. Superior quality coupled with timely shipment by Amazon made it most enjoyable. Highly recommend for anyone who loved Weird Science, Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, & St. Elmo's Fire."
4,Val Kilmer Party Dude,Val Kilmer is the ultimate party dude who happens to be a genius. Fun and crazy.
4,Never Gets Old,"This could have been a complete disaster. I think only the creative casting of some very talented actors and the fact that it is a light-hearted romp of a comedy keeps it from nose-diving into the contrived climax. It's occasionally corny, but fun. Oddly, it doesn't seem too dated. There are period references, but can easily taken in historical context. I was probably 17 when I first watched Real Genius, probably at a hotel or at a friend's house on cable. I can say that this movie has withstood the test of time for me. It's as funny today as it was then. Michelle Meyrink is an excellent counterpoint to the typical bimbos in teen movies. I'd have like to see her in some more films. Val Kilmer must have been trying to break into Hollywood here. He's really the movie's heart. Don't expect A Beautiful Mind here, but played back-to-back with Weird Science would be a great 80's retro geek fest."
4,Real Genius is Real Genius,"I have loved this movie since I first saw it in the 80's. Okay, so it's another one of those 80's goofy adolescent movies...it's fun. Because of the rapid banter and inane situations, its one of those movies you can watch over and over and still enjoy. Where else can you see a dorm turned into a winter wonderland, a rocket scientist living in a closet, popcorn blowing the roof off a house and Val Kilmer in bunny slippers?"
5,Captures The Essence of College Life,"""Real Genius"" is a gem among 80s movies and college films. Filled with all the music, intrigue, and uniqueness of the 80s, ""Real Genius"" is a great 'remember when' film to watch for those of us who grew up in that crazy decade. Beyond that, ""Real Genius"" is a great portrayal of college life. Take your more recent, contemporary 'school' films - practically all they revolve around is teenagers trying to have sex or going out with the most attractive/popular person in school (with the ultimate objective of having sex with them). ""Real Genuis"" has an original storyline that doesn't link to a quest for popularity or sex drive. Anyone who's ever gone to college will connect with this film, as it has all the earmarks of undergraduate education - from final exam panic attacks to heartless professors who assign impossible projects. All in all, this is a great film...I just wish it'd be released on DVD!"
4,VERY funny movie,"It's a shame Val Kilmer doesn't do more comedies. He was great in this (and in Top Secret.) If you're a Val fan and haven't seen this, do yourself a favor and see it.If you're not a Val fan...see it anyway. It's a riot."
4,Fun and sadly overlooked film.,"I first saw this years ago on Comedy Central, and only caught the ending. After waiting for it to come on again, I loved the wittiness of the movie, and the great light-hearted comedy. Overall, I can't complain much about this movie. Sure, it's not an acting masterpiece like the Godfather, but if you liked Revenge of the Nerds, you'll love this movie."
5,"Fun, high jinks and genius!!!!!","I love Real Genius I watch the DVD almost every night and will probably melt my DVD machine! The film leaves me with a warm feeling and recharges me. It is a feel good factor movie, granted it will not win Oscars, Baftas etc, it does its job magnificently. The cast is well picked and the film's climax is just perfect, made even better by Tears for Fears' song 'Everybody wants to rule the world'. So if anyone is reading this review I will end by saying to you, if you are down, depressed buy this film and watch it it will bring a big smile to your face!!!"
4,Another 80s movie that takes me back,"This is a movie from my youth and eventually, we just had to break down and buy it! It is hilarious! If you have never seen this 80's classic, check it out. You will not regret it. Val Kilmer is just great in this movie and although most of the cast was unknown at the time, and many may still be, this movie holds up."
3,Really Genius,"Real Genius was the 1st time I saw Val Kilmer. He is very funny. At a school for genius young people, you see how some of them cope with their skills. Val was once a very serious student & almost went brain dead. Now he copes by being a funny goof-off. I enjoyed the antics & behaviors that are brought out of these real genius's."
5,STILL AWESOME,"Total 80's flick, however, it had a smarts to it that just made it timeless and CLASSIC. There are so many little gems that KILL. Just as ""Spies Like Us"" was basically a little lacking in some areas, it had moments of greatness. Real Genius is ALL GREAT, every frame. Absolutely worth a viewing (renting), although this is proudly a TOP DRAWER DVD for me."
3,"Movie Great, DVD blows","The movie itself is great. Cheesy, but a true 80s classic. Unfortunately, this DVD version is horrible. If you already own the VHS, don't bother with the DVD. There is nothing extra on the DVD at all. No commentary, no notes, no trivia, no cast info, no original trailers, nothing. Totally slapped together. I'm sick of McDVDs like this. Personally, I'm waiting for the Special Edition that you *just know* they will crank out once the market is saturated with this version."
4,Pretty Good Movie...,This is one of Val Kilmer's first movies and a pretty worthy effort on his part. He plays a hot shot physics (or something) student who is a little bit on the eccentric side. He is teamed up with a 15 year old hot shot and wackiness ensues.the scene at the end of this movie is classic as are some of the lines used.
4,"Floating, sir...","I will not waste anymore time with this; the movie was, is and will always be a great cult/80s classic. Val Kilmer is brilliant as Chris Knight. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that there are no deleted scenes; specifically... ""Knight!!! What the hell are you doing?"" ""Floating, sir""..."
2,Awful graphics,"This game has very disappointing graphics - There are lines running through the entire game. Tried an adaptor and the batteries, hoping that was the problem, but it wasn't. Not worth the money."
2,Disappointing...,"Playing Texas Hold'em was disappointing. You can only bet/raise a pre-set amount specified in the game settings before you play. I agree, the graphics are sub-par. I will give it another test to make sure I'm not missing something, but if not, I'll be returning it."
2,not very useful for us,"I was hoping to read more about detailed dealing with reflux and perhaps my expectations were wrong. This book talked a lot about what we already knew, a lot of common sense. It's a very thin book that I went through very quickly. I wasted my money and if you're looking for more about reflux the internet is the best tool. If you're looking to make peace with yourself with a reflux baby, this might be the book for you. However we didn't need a book to tell us to be nice to our baby. We love her wholeheartedly even if she screams and throw up all over ourselves every day. We were not depressed about it knowing that she will out-grow her reflux in just a few more months. And sure enough, now that she's 3 months old she's MUCH better."
3,Laborious Technique,"Although the artist produces beautiful paintings, her techniques seem tedious and laborious. She admits ""...my paintings take several weeks to complete ..."" p.14. She glazes many washes of watercolor over double-wetted (""priming"")drawings: ""The quintessence of my style is the gentle buildup of fine wash upon wash."" p. 30. She says, ""even the delicate, light shades in my paintings require several washes."" p.36 In essence, you would be painting over your painting several times; it's like painting the same picture over and over. I wish someone would write a book on alla prima watercolor painting."
5,Great service,This book arrived very quickly and the condition was really good. I am very happy with the service. The actual book is wonderful and the instruction is excellent.
5,Flower painters bible,"I first came across this book at our monthly flower painters class, and was so impressed with it I ordered it from Amazon straight away.It has become my Flower Painters Bible with good informative instruction on painting in stages and design. I often open the book for inspiration, and members of the class dive into it."
3,Less then I expected,"The faceplate is both cool and easy to instal. However it only comes with the top half of the controler. So it disrupts the ""coolness"" of it because the sides and botem are still white and gray."
4,"great condition, great book!","Thank you, this will make a great addition to my library,I've already read most of it, and really love it!"
4,good deal,"I love the sweater and the color. The fit is excellent and and really good quality. The price was awesome, I would order more cashmere sweaters without a problem."
5,Fantastic!,"What a great album. From the haunting intro to the rockin' ""Reindeer Are Wild"" or the surf rock intrumentals like ""Lakota Women"" - This album has got it all!"
3,a bit too advanced,"v-smile is a great concept but the games are very limited. This one is for children 5 and up. If they had more variety in the games - or made the games more ""generic"" I think that kids would like them better. Why does the game cartridge, that comes with the V-Smile system, have some sort of bad Brittish or English accent? My kids really hate that. Its a bit hard to understand in parts."
1,Too Complicated,"I bought this game for my son. I am very dissappointed in it. It is too hard for a child to play. Heck, I have a hard time with it. I love VSMILE and all the games but this one."
5,An Excellent and Scholarly Introduction to Classical Apologe,Excellent introduction to Classical Apologetics as opposed to Presuppositionalism. Puts the subject clearly in its theological and historical context
3,The worst of the guttermouth collection,"I believe this is the worst of the guttermouth collection, When I listen to it, I just get sick of it incredibly fast, but buy it if you must"
3,Certain songs only,"Don't get me wrong; this album is just fine, but even Mark, Stever, James, Scott, and Derek would agree that this is not the real Guttermouth. James T. Nunn said, ""We've done some of our best stuff under pressure"", which is why only a few of the songs on this album really hit the nail right on the head with a catchy tune. If you want RAW Guttermouth, then look into either Musical Monkey or The Album Formerly Known as Full-Length LP."
1,Not a good pacifier.,"This seems like such a good idea, but my daughter hated these pacifiers. They were always snapping shut on her, and the closures seemed to press into her face and not be comfortable. I offered them over and over, but finally gave up. I found one in the car months later that I'd left there for an emergency, and I offered it again, but she still couldn't keep it in her mouth."
3,Panda Pacifier really really cute but...,The whole concept of the pacifier closing when dropped is amazing and the panda decoration is so cute but the structural design is off. The 2 pieces that close over the part the baby sucks on stick out too far when the pacifier is open and when the baby is sucking on the pacifier it leaves red marks on their cheeks and also tends to fall out more because of this. Designers should have angled back the plastic to accommodate for the protruding covers.
3,Paci that stays clean!,"This pacifier would of been great if I had given it too my daughter when she was younger. I was tired of cleaning of pacifiers that she drops at 10 months and found this one. She didn't take to it as she was used to the old one. I love how it closes when it hits the ground. However, when she picks it up off the ground she can't open it back up to reuse and tries to stick the whole thing w/ the plastic cover back into her mouth and that doesn't work well. So I don't use it as pacifier anymore it is more of a toy when we are shopping that she plays with trying to open and close!"
3,Did not stay clean.,"Overall, this pacifier was good, but every time it was dropped it did not close like it was supposed to. It completely defeated the purpose."
2,"Nice photos, poor floor plans","While this book contains many fine crafted houses, nicely photographed. As an architect, I was very dissapointed with the 'sketchy' floor plan presentation format. Not only do the plans lack a sense of scale (It would be nice to see proposed furniture layouts that could better indicate how people relate), but kitchens and bath rooms are shown just as boxy rooms (no fixtures or casework!)"
5,The Heart of the Family,"We just finished building our first family home in 1999 and I wish I had this book before we began! We looked at 10,000 floorplans and now live in a craftsman style, family friendly home in the woods. What a gift is a well-designed, well-built house. But the heart of the family is not the building, but the love and commitment which grows between family members by God's grace.For another book published in April 2000 on the family home, take a look at THE FAMILY CLOISTER: BENEDICTINE WISDOM FOR THE HOME, by David Robinson (New York: Crossroad, 2000)."
4,Both fun and educational!,"My wife and I bought this for our oldest daughter for Christmas. She's four and loved the movie upon which this game is based. Although it isn't her favorite v-smile game, she quite enjoyed it nonetheless. As parents, my wife and I found this game a little more challenging for our daughter in terms of its education value.Probably the most educational game is in the market where Ariana must find different items on a shopping list and then count the number of each particular item needed. There are a number of other great games that involve counting and expanding a child's vocabulary. These are probably the two educational strengths of this particular game, as a child the age towards which this game is intended (4 to 6 years) is probably already familiar with matching and colors -- the other two strengths of this game."
5,A great game,"My daughter absolutely loves this game. It is more challenging than some of the other, but not too hard for a 4 year old. This game is not as educational as some of the others, but is great for math/counting skills. If your daughter loves Aerial ahe will love dressing her up in hats, and jewelery, and love helping her shop in the market for different fruits an vegetables. I think this one is great,"
4,One of our favorites!,"Alot of these v smile games have really crappy graphics, this ones not so bad and out of all the games in this age range, it's one of her favorites. I purchased the v smile for her for Christmas along with about 7 games. My only mistake was to give them all to her at once. As with any 4 year old, who is having their first game system experience, she would play a game for a minute or two and then get discouraged and put in another. I had to take them all away and let her choose one game to play per day. Whichever game she chose for that day was the only one she got no matter how hard she found it. That did the trick, she learned how to play all of them in this manner and now I let her choose as she pleases. These are great games for the age group, this one in particular."
2,not the best v smile game,"I purchased this game, The little Mermaid for my 4 1/2 year old daughter. She became frustrated when she had a hard time moving Ariel with the joystick underwater, Ariel moves very slow. She became bored with this game and did not find the games to be fun or challenging."
3,Little Mermaid didn't float,"According to my almost 5 year old, she didn't like it as much as the Care Bears game. Moving around and navigating Ariel was a not as easy. And the games was not as fun as the ones in Care Bears. THis game may be more suitable for 5-6 year olds."
2,Fun but not too much,"This product was a pretty ok game, but the system it is compatible with hasbeen terrible. I think this version is about 3-4 years old. We bought it brandnew 3-4 years ago, and the system started having issues after just a few months.We threw it away after it sitting on the shelf for about a year. When itworked properly, my children enjoyed it, but that was short lived. It was playedoff and on for about a year and then the system almost quit working all together.Hopefully, the new version works properly for a long time especially consideringthe amount of money invested in it."
4,teach your kid to count and match,Little Mermiad v-tech smile is a very cute game for a little girl. It has a lot of the movie in the game and ariel's majestic journey has helped my daughter learn to count fruits and vegs. and match different items found in ship ect/ect. It's worth the money.
4,Glad It's Back,"S L & G is indeed an overlooked group from the 80s. Not the best technical musicians, but they certainly tapped the root of that pre-grunge, introspective sound that is found in those groups like The Damned, The Chameleons, and The Church. Mellow with an edge. House of Love may be of interest for some S L & G fans, too! Heck, maybe some Smiths as well. Why not?"
1,Warning - doesn't work for treating a UTI,"I was so hopeful after reading all of the reviews that this product was going to work for me. Sadly, it didn't work at all and maybe even made my symptoms worse. I used it for over two weeks and my UTI never got any better. I finally went into my doctor and had to take a 10 day course of antibiotics. I asked my doctor about these types of products and he said that they may work to help prevent UTIs but should never be used to treat one."
5,s florida,"I have used this for my dog who has had chronic urinary problems, she will still get an infection now and then. I will start her on cleartract a few times a day when I suspect an infection starting and most times it will stop it.Update: I use this as a preventative for my Bichon. I just put a little in her food every morning with a bit of water and she has been free of uti's for over 3-4 years."
5,Clear Tract Works,I suffer from frequent UTI's and have found that Clear Tract helps clear them up. I just follow the dosage instructions and I feel better within the day. If I go on a maintenance routine then I find I rarely get a UTI. I have been using this product for quite a while now. Try it and I think you will be happy with it.
5,Miracle Product!,"I've suffered from UTI's (one about every 3 months) for over 15 years and was constantly on antibiotics and having to run to the doctor all the time. Then I would get yeast infections from being on the antibiotics, no win situation! Since I've been taking Cleartract (I take the capsules though) I haven't had an infection in over a year! This stuff is a miracle! Thank the Lord!Update... I'ts been almost 5 months since I posted the review above and still no more UTI!! I take 2 of the capsule form of this product every night. It's just wonderful!! I can't say enough about how great this product is!!Update #2... It's been almost 2 1/2 years since I posted this review and STILL no infections, woo hoo!! I love this stuff!!"
5,It changed my perspective,"Even though it's a children's book, and I'm way past being a child, I enjoyed this book so much I've been looking for it for four years now. I live in Guatemala C.A, so it's pretty hard to find books which are not bestsellers. But anyway, if you're having doubts about your life and the way things have turned up, read this book, it will change the way you see things, for the better, and who knows? you might end up feeling like a child again (such a wonderful feeling!)."
3,for younger children,I thought Mountains of Tibet was written more for children age 6 or under. It is an alright book but much too simple for 9-12 year olds.
3,Love is the Tender Trap,"I wouldn't rate this as Shulman's or Smith's best work. I've been told that they didn't get along that well. But it's still worth reading.After you read it, watch the Sinatra movie!"
3,The Celebrity Underside,"If you enjoy watching the inability of celebrities to take control of their lives, this program is for you. It's sad that the so-called beautiful people have painful, ugly lives. Makes one feel so happy to be ordinary!!!"
3,storyline good but lacks enthusiasm and appeal,"After watching Season 5 and comparing it with other seasons, the storyline is still good and entertaining. However in this season I lack enthusiasm, emotional appeal - as if the emotional connection between the characters has weaked. I don't know if it depends on how the actors are directed or that the viewers is not drawn deeply enough into the lives, feelings and issues of the characters as in previous seasons.In some of the episodes the storyline is abrupted, and the viewer just see the outcome but now how something happened (took place).Overall L-word is worth watching and has a few funny episodes and scenes like the mud wrestling."
3,Dislike characters,"This show has become almost unbearable to watch with certain characters, such as Phyllis, Joyce, Helena and Jenny.I especially hate Jenna's character, I truly just want her to die already. Why didn't you kill her off instead of Dana?!"
4,Season 5,"Season 1 is and always be my favorite. However, I really liked Season 5 (except that there was way too much Jenny). If you are a Tibette fan, you'll want this DVD set."
4,L-Word Season Five,"If you are a fan of hot lesbian sxx & drama, then there is no shortage of it in the Fifth Season of this Showtime hit!Jenny's a b*tch (what else is new?) and everyone still wants to sleep with Shane... sprinkle in some Sapphic prison scenes and the L-Word makes for great TV anyday!"
1,Delivery has taken over 2 months,"the seller claims he sent the product, but I never received it, and now he promised to sent it again and it will take again 2 weeks to deliver. I had no idea I was buying from some one other than amazonbig mistake from my part, and very poor service on his part. He never sent a delivery confirmation. I am sure he sent it through the cheapest and less reliable carriernot a good experiencesara schmidt"
3,Great if you like Soft Porn...boring otherwise,"While season four added too many plots resulting in a series that felt disjointed and characters who moved like robots through plot twists completely lacking foreshadowing, series five goes off in an even less satisfying direction.The scripts for this season can be summed up in two sentences, ""We've run out of storylines. Everyone please remove your clothes before the audience drifts off to sleep.""It is pretty sex with nice bodies and well done lesbian oriented sex, but with few exceptions, don't expect any stronger plots than the average X rated movie."
5,best purchase,i would for sure buy from this seller again fast shipping great quality loved everything thanks
5,Couldn't Stop Watching,"This show is so good that I watched each season over the course of a weekend at a time. You really ""get into the characters"". Watching/waiting/hoping for Bette and Tina to get back together was so much fun. I don't understand why some folks don't like Jenny Schecter (Mia Kirshner)-she's my favorite character on the show and she's downright gourgeous! I look forward to the 6th and final season."
5,The L word,"Great series, I was never really into this show, but I cant stop watching it now, although I cant stand some of the characters now I still love the show. It's a great show, can give some insight to those who doesn't approve or accept gays or lesbians."
4,L WORD 5 - GREAT STUFF,"I didnt know what to expect for season 5 after the strange ending from season 4. But it does have a little bit of everything and definately keeps you wanting more. Shane's hair is a bit over the top, but other than that its a great season. It does take a few episodes to get into the swing of things. Then finishes with a bang !Great stuff"
5,L Word Season 5,This season is so much better than season 4! I just wish the seasons would come out faster so I can get caught up quicker!
2,The L Word - The Compelt Fifth Season,"I purchased season 5 and was very disappointed to find that the last disk only has the final episode on it and is missing the 2 previous episodes. I made a complaint to Amazon who sent me a replacement of season 5 which has the exact same problem! Therefore I was not able to watch the complete series! Very annoying as it seems to be a manufacturer's problem as both disks are the same and go straight to the final episode! Needless to say I was not happy with the outcome! Very disappointing...Regards, Grace Battaglia"
3,No eng subtitles???,I have seen all seasons of the L word with english subtitles but this season has no subtitles???!
5,Informative & Educational - Grand Canyon Hikes,"Great overview of hiking trails in the Grand Canyon, which makes trip planning very productive! Great overview that covers trailhead locations, hiking distances, elevation gain/loss, difficulty rating, general maps (still need detailed topo maps), water availability, landmarks, scenic highlights, etc. Great value!"
3,Great Scenic Trips,"This book offers hikes for the more adventurous souls. I gave it as a gift to someone who really likes to explore the less traveled paths and among many books on hiking the Grand Canyon, this book seemed to fit the bill. I'm waiting to hear from my friend, when they get to go, and find out first hand how they enjoyed the various hikes."
5,great product,I love this product. I have a passion for film photography and this canon shots better then the canon rebal k2.Very fast shipping great condition and the seller is very informative....All together great product and service i look forward to buying more products from this seller .
5,An inviting history of grand eating,"Roy Strong's Feast is inviting history of grand eating examines the social history and cultural phenomenon of entertaining and feasts; from its early heyday in the 9th century when a Babylonian emperor invited 70,000 guests for dinner, to modern times. Engaging historic black and white photos pepper a culinary history which provides plenty of insights on the background and evolution of the idea of the feast and the culinary celebration of food."
4,Food for thought,"An intriguing book on a universal subject. Feasts are ultimately a spectacle where food is used to project personal influence, make deals and curry favors. As Strong shows, these motivations haven't changed thru seismic changes in the art of the meal (introduction of fork and spoon, tables, sugar, spice ..). The prehistoric culinary history spanning the Greek and Romans is fascinating, as is the rediscovery of these ""excesses"" under the watchful eyes of the church. The post-renaissance portrayal becomes less intrigue and more detail, although there are some nice segments about the effect of sugar, the rise and fall of spice and the emergence of etiquette. The latter half of the book could be more entertaining, but all in all worth a read."
1,Pins fall out easily,"I rarely opened my cases, but both of mine lost the pins that hold the lid on within a few weeks. So now the lids don't stay on, making them useless if you want to take them anywhere."
1,Waste of Money!!!,"Don't waste your money on these UMD holders. Altoid Sours tins or Ice Breakers tins work just as well. You only pay $1.75 for each one, and you get candy. They can hold 2 UMDs like these can. So, instead of paying $5 + shipping, just buy 2 Altoid Sours for $3.50!!!!!!"
5,The Confession,"I first saw this film in a theatre in Munich while I was statlioned there in the Army (1972). It was stunning. Years later, it was shown on the A&E channel (about 1992). Since then, I have tried to track it down on VHS or DVD, but no luck (I want it NTSC with English subtitles as I do not speak French). About five years ago, Costa Gravas was interviewed and he stated that its anti-communist message was not welcome in Hollywood, and that the film was being repressed. A bit of research that I did brings out the fact that the film is based on the experiences of Rudolph Slansky, and it is quite accurate as to Stalinist methods of repression. As a movie, it cannot qualify as ""entertainment;"" just too gripping and horrifying. It has been compared to the quasi-novel, ""Darkness at Noon,"" which was loosely based on the tragedy of N. Bukharin's liquidatilon by Stalin in the 1930's."
2,every song sounds the same,"This is the same album Billy Childish put out last month and will put out again next month. He's cobbled together about three ""original"" songs from riffs stolen from Link Wray, the Sonics, the Kinks and Bo Diddley. Then he's managed to alter them just enough to put out album after album of supposedly ""new"" material. And it seems every album sells better than the last. The music is good, simple rock'n'roll, but who does he think he's fooling? Get this if you must, but you'd be wiser to stick with his previous bands, the Milkshakes and Thee Mighty Caesars."
4,Nice little comb,"I agree with others that the teeth could be closer together. It does do a nice job on my 'stache, though. It glides through the hairs whether they are waxed or not. A little long to keep in breast pocket but durable enough to keep in back pocket. Sturdy and nice craftmanship."
5,Maybe the best book on prosody yet,"I'm using Kinzie's book right now in a poetry class I teach. I think it's one of the few books to actually talk about the kinds of tensions that make poems work and not work. I'm especially impressed by her discussions of the way lines and sentences work with and at times against one another. I haven't read in any of the recent crop of books on prosody anything about the relationship of sentence to line, which makes Kinzie's work all the more exciting and original. And smart. I recommend this book to anyone who's really interested in the kinds of questions all poets must face. I wish someone would've given me this much information before I got to grad school. It's a terrific book, and not so hard to understand as the numbers of pages might suggest."
2,Terrible,This movie wasn't that great.You really didn't care who lived or who died.The only good thing about this movie was Eric Roberts.To bad he got killed off so early.
2,Not too awful but the acting was incredibly poor (IMHO),"The movie was fairly decent for the genre, nothing especially great about it but nothing too terrible except for the dreadful quality of the acting. Stunningly bad.Good storyline and not too bad for popcorn fodder.....just please, hire competent actors whenever whoever decides to make a movie makes a movie....don't hire friends of friends or street people or wherever the people in this movie were found. Ruined what could have easily been a 4 star rated film."
4,Scary m,This is a very dark scary movie that has a lot of depth... You have to really reach down into your mind and soul to understand this girls horror and how she makes it through a long lonely capture. There are times that you are not sure if this is really happening. And I will be sure that I travel with lots of emergency tools and with plenty of company. The young people in the movie are very good actors.
2,KEEPSAKE IS NOT A KEEPER,"Although a twisted surprise ending concludes this movie, KEEPSAKE is another torture exploitation film focusing on the degradation of women, passing itself off as entertainment. Writer/director Paul Moore allows our ""heroine"" Janine to consistently do stupid things and fills the script with numerous faux escapes in a sloppy attempt to create suspense. There are more plotholes than Swiss cheese but to avoid spoilers, I won't go into them here. KEEPSAKE also suffers from slow pacing and bad acting. If you stay awake, the finale is effective, but it by no means redeems the movie."
2,HMMMM,"This movie was super sluggish at times, dark, and definitely not for the faint of heart, or.....other parts of your anatomy. Twisted ending for sure."
3,Ok for 1 time watch - but nothing special,"The movie starts off well with susbtantial tension. However, things go rapidly downhill and it becomes a monotonous exchange between the 2 people - I greaw tired of the repeated escape attempts ! Ok for 1 watch but nothing special."
2,Waste of a rental,"It was a bored to death night & I had $2 to burn I guess. You may like it, but I didn't even go through the whole thing."
2,"To complex for me, dudes:(","Graphics look ok, sound's ok, but I for one do not wish to spend a few hours studying the manual before being able to play a game. And even then it's a drag to input all your commands and having to return all your troops and credits to the staging area at the end of each mission!"
2,Money better spent elsewhere,"I owned this game for less than 2 hours. I recommend you download the 2150 demo, play it, uninstall it, then go buy Ground Control. It's a much better game."
3,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","I love RTS games in general, I recently bought Earth 2150 and have put a good 25 hours into the game. Here is what I think of it: Highs: Great futuristic scenario, cool 3d engine, great weapons. Lows: User interface, software bugs, hard to control units in the heat of battle. The biggest problem with this game is the user interface. Compared to other RTS games such as Age of Kings, or Command and Conquer, this game offers a very awkward and counter-intuitive user interface. The so called Total 3D Warfare loses it's ""Wow"" factor pretty quickly. It is a decent buy overall, especially with the price cut by a third, but I wouldn't call it one of the greatest real time strategy game around. The designers should take cues from other RTS games on the GUI, then this game will be a contender. Overall, the game's OK, nothing to stay up for."
4,A GOOD C&C like game,"Normaly I don't play ripoff games, but this one defenatly blew my mind! I often play as the United Civilied States (UCS in short). This game kinda reminds me of Total Annihilation almost too. It's 3d graphics are amazing! So a 3DFX card is required."
2,Good grafics but average gameplay,I recently downloaded the incredibly big demo of Earth 2150. I thought it had impressive 3d grafics and all that other stuff but ultimatly all the rotation just made the game confusing. Some of your units don't even do what they tell you. I think all the game comes down to is another bad game like Tiberian Sun. They make it look cool when it isn't really fun.
2,Not that good,"The game is good but the building and all units are the same color and it is hard to tell who is who and what is what. The graphics may look good generally but if you look closely the details on some things are horible! The guys who made that game made the units with diffreent shapes and lines so it make it even harder to see. Units and building are so covered with shapes and lines, that it reminds me of a low budget movie.Also when it is night in the game, You cant see anything! I have a 100% vision my friend and that game is nothing but poop."
5,215O! That's what time it will be when you're done playing,"I purchased this game based upon past reviews. Boy I am glad I did, without going into to great depth here is a brief description of the game: harvest, build, and FIGHT.The graphics are excellent and game play is fairly easy (once you're past the learning curve). I cannot comment on replay ability because I have finished a complete mission yet.The 3D effects are unbelievable, but you better have a 3D card (I have a Voodoo that I love).I feel this game was money well spent, (as I'm sure you know there's nothing worst than getting a game that sucks) and look forward to many hours of playing."
4,Adjustable dovetail template,Overall the template is well made. The one let down is that the t-knobs on the set screws tend to slip. I'm replacing them with hex head screws. It will take a bit more time to set the location of the pins but I'll be sure they won't slip.
5,Just Beautiful,"After years of searching, was finally able to restore this treasured storybook back to our library. (Thank you, Amazon.com, for not giving up in your search to find it for me.)"
3,Mad Hatter,I received this product in great condition! The best song on this CD isChange of Seasons.
3,Some really cool tunes,"Overall I like this CD, my favorites are a ""Change of A Season"" and ""Good With The Bad""."
2,not their best day in the sun,"""Disregard Of Timekeeping"" is the album to get by Bonham. Pick ""Mad Hatter"" up only if you want an out of print album to finish your collection of a band. Bonham is undoubtely Led Zeppelin wannabe's, but at least Disregard was listenable. This gets lost in a prog-rock mess. You can find a review of ""Disregard"" I did at [...]. As someone who listens to rock ablums weekly for a review blog and loved ""Disregard"" from the first minute ... ""Mad Hatter"", no matter how much I tried, wasn't worth reviewing for my blog."
5,A Sure Bet for you 80's Music Fans,"I've looked high and low for the CD version of ""The Kings Are Here""(my album got trashed during my college years). I finally found it with two clicks of a mouse. And I wasn't dissapointed. The Kings sound as fresh as they did back in 1981. The songs ""The Beat Goes on/Switching to Glide"" and ""Partyitis"" are worth the price of the CD alone. They contiue to be great party songs. The rest of the CD has some hidden gems which I forgot about, but they are great toons (""Run Shoes Running"", ""It's Okay"" and ""Right to the Top""). I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves 80's alternative rock like ""The Romantics"", ""The Kingbees"" and ""The Knack""."
5,The Kings are still here.,"Contrary to some of the reviews that I have read on this site, the Kings never went away. They were just pinched into a corner (Like a lot of good bands) by the stifling Madison Avenue record company machine that promotes only what they believe will sell to non descript consumers. (How else can you explain the Back Street Boys & Britney Spears). This album is excellent and holds it's own and then some over today's contemporary pop/rock. To get even more information about the Kings, check out their web site...!"
4,The other songs rock too!,"I bought this for beat goes on/swichin' to glide. I was pleasantly surprised that the other songs did not suck. There are a lot of fun songs on this album. it's okay, and go away are great simple songs, If The Stars Come Out Tonight is great!!! I got this from the other sellers for $7.50 and it is well worth it! if you like the 2 hits I am certain you will find many other songs on this disc that will surprise you too."
5,Fantastic and Undiscovered,"The Kings quickly came and went, but what they left behind is definitely worth owning. Released about 1980, this is a great collection of pop/rock music leading into the alternative rock era. Many people point to ""We Will Rock You/We Are the Champions"" by Queen, or ""the side B suite"" on Abbey Road as the best multiple song runs ever recorded. The fact is that ""This Beat Goes On/Switching to Glide"" surpasses anything I've heard, and is worth the price of the album. 5-stars!"
4,Royalty Reigns!,"... and then....then....they came! The Kings! What a sound!! It was nice to hear a good groove, good keyboards, and understandable (if not meaningful) lyrics! ""This Beat Goes On/Switching to Glide"" is the ONLY hit I remember ... If you want to know about the end of the 70's and the beginning of the 80's, this is as good a place musically to start as any other album from 1980. It may even be a better one; you won't be overwhelmed with anything political or social here; just fun grooves that make the most cynical people bop for a few minutes."
2,Eh...pedestrain fomulae rock. What's the big deal?,"I didn't rush out and buy it when the ads hit Rolling Stone. I waited until a few years later & scored a used copy. I see now why they didn't last. Shoot, the guitars don't even have any ""crunch"" to them! This really might be fun if played overly loud & you are half-snockered...but other than that it's pretty much formula rock. So were the Ramones. But there was a reason why THEY were around a few more years!"
4,The Fish is Back!,"After waiting four years for another Reel Big Fish album, it's natural that some fans would get overly excited to a point where no album could ever meet their expectations. What these people fail to notice is that, yes this album may be upbeat in many ways, but what ska album isn't? They experiment with punk a little more than before, and maybe it's a little catchier, but it's still an amazing album. With the exception of a few cheezy lyrics in the opening track, this is Reel Big Fish at their cleverest and wittiest. ""Lust turns to disgust/A heart of gold into rust/A soft touch to a slap in the face"". This is a fun, witty album that actually captures a little bit of Reel Big Fish's personality through their biting sarcasm and humor. This is Reel Big Fish's finest album, by far!"
3,just cuz it's RBF,"When i popped this cd in my stereo the other day, i was thouroughly disappointed by RBF's latest. WHAT HAPPENED TO SKA???????? *sigh* i'm sure more straight rock fans will appreciate this album, but if you love ska, you will be disappointed in what RBF has put out this time. RBF's prime, in my opinion, was back at 'Turn the Radio Off' and i recommend ska fans go buy that cd, not this one."
3,They did what Less Than Jake did.,"I'm not going to say they sold out, because people that say things like that are stupid and pigheaded. But this CD is NOT ska. If you're looking for ska, buy Turn the Radio Off. That's an excellent CD. They've done exactly what LTJ did with Borders and Boundaries. In fact, this CD SOUNDS like Borders and Boundaries. It's pop with horns spliced in. One thing I do have to give RBF props for is their vocal harmonies. Scott is doing an AMAZING job with the backup vocals and Aaron's voice sounds better now. *sigh* If only it was ska. But don't worry! There IS hope! Aaron the singer, is in a new band with a bunch of guys from Jeffery's Fan Club, and it's GOOD SKA! The band is called Forces Of Evil and it's pretty funny cause they all have names like ""Aaron EVIL"" but it's really good ska music. Check it out!"
5,Ratings For Cheer Up!,"1.Good Thing=Great way to open the album and very catchy 9/102.Somebody Loved Me=Slow at the start and kind of boring 6.5/103.Ban The Tube Top=One of the best songs ,very catchy 10/104.Good Thing=An ok song but not the best ,quite short too 7.5/105.Where have You Been=Great guitar, great lyrics,great song 10/106.Suckers=Not the best but still good and catchy 7.5/107.What Are Friends For=A good song but not great 8/108.A Little Doubt Goes A Long Way=Starts to grow on you 8.5/109.Dateless Losers=Very good songs,very catchy 9.5/1010.Valerie=Good song and good drum and bass intro 9/1011.Rock 'N' Roll Is Bitchin'=This song gets on my nerves 2.5/1012.New York,New York=A good cover of a classic 8/1013.Sayonara Senorita=No point to this song 4/1014.Boss DJ=Good reggie Song 8/1015.Brand New Hero=Good Guitar intro,good song 8.5/1016.Drunk Again=Not to sure about this song 5/10"
1,Reel Big Garbage,"It's really sad to see a band that could have been the best ska band out there to fall so fast and hard. I have all 3 of there major album releases and still contend that their first album (Turn the Radio Off) is one of the top 5 ska albums of all time. Their first album being so great is what makes this album such a bitter pill to swallow. They have sold out, but I don't know who they have sold out too. The music lacks direction, creativity, or anything necessary to keep your attention. This is uninspiring dribble."
4,There are some great songs on this CD,"Well I am a big RBF fan and while there are a few songs that dont belong on this CD,most are good or awesome, Where have u been and Good Thing are the best, A little doubt goes a long way is classic RBF. Valerie is another tune which only tru RBF fans will love. Brand new hero is alright. Dateless Losers is alright as well. I dont especially like these songs, Somebody Loved Me,Rock N Roll Is Bitchin, and Drunk Again, Besides that I like all of them at diff levels. Ban the tube top is a good good song,The cover of Boss DJ was almost def gonna be good, I mean its covering Sublime and saying that this album is the same as a previous one is stupid. Its jus the same kind of music, what do u want from them, to change their whole sort of music they make, people are stupid, Great album again from RBF, buy it, u dateless loser."
5,Another Great RBF CD,"RBF, if they are your cup of tea, does it again on their newest album. Catchy guitar riffs combined with a fuller horn sound makes this album different from either WDTRSH? and TTRO. Check out the newly arranged Boss DJ and Scott's great vocals on Drunk Again for a good sampling of the range of the band. A good album for those who like the band, but for those who are new to RBF i would suggest Why Do They Rock So Hard?."
1,GOD AWFUL,"I love ska and punk and i love reel big fish. HOWEVER this album is HORRIBLE it isn't even really ska. There is no intragration between the music and the horns. It is just rock with random horns thrown into it. It dosnt sound any good. The only good song is ""good thing"" and thats it. Actually the cover is pretty cool too. Other than that the cd is not anygood. Turn the radio off, and why do they rock so hard? are SO MUCH BETTER buy them instead."
2,Not at all worth getting,"The first two albums are really really great. ""why do they rock so hard"" inspired me to learn guitar! (I ended up being too lazy, but anyway...) This album is a major disappointment. It really is pop-ska and it is incredibly uninspired and uninspiring. Listen to the samples and you'll see! These songs are really cheesy, and not in the cool-cheesy way that some of their past songs have been. This is not nearly as bad as britney spears, but it's not really worth getting."
2,Boring,"I REALLY wanted to like this album. I've listened to it multiple times, hoping that it would hook me like their last one did, but the only question that I kept asking was, what happened to the fun ska band from ""Turn the Radio Off""? One of the best things about RBF was their ""F-You"" attitude and sense of humor...two things that are sorely missing from this CD. Every song on this disc seems to be screaming ""Please play me on the radio"", but there's nothing catchy or original about any of them. Seems like they're just trying too hard to be hip and forgot how to have fun. It's simply just boring, and your money is better spent elsewhere."
2,Dissapointment...,"This CD is simply boring! RBF is one of my favorite bands and after seeing them in a couple of concerts which were extremely awesome,I can't imagine going to see them to hear the songs of this aweful, backstreet boys clone of an album. Its so full of pop that there should have been a warning label for us ska lovers stating simply that there was NO SKA. And don't tell me that a few horns in a song make ska music because then salsa music would be ska too.And talking about warning labels... Where were the swearing and the funny bad language to express a point through humor? They truly became an NSync that can play instruments. Soon they will be doing Chili's commercials.Cheer Up should be bought as a gift but not for yourself because you'll end up feeling cheated like I did."
2,"How can I ""Cheer Up"" when listening to this album.","It really suprises me when people say that this is the best album by RBF. Maybe this is my opinion, but i don't buy RBF CDs to get cheap sounding ska-pop, I buy RBF for the good ska, good lyrics. I don't really care for the cutesy, popish lyrics and this album is not one you can skank to, either. The guys in RBF are some of the most talented musicians out there, i just think that in this album they catered more to the mainstream pop instead of giving us old RBF fans something to skank to and enjoy like previous albums. I am hoping that the next album will be a return to a sound similar to their previous albums."
1,What happend to RBF,"I couldn't wait to hear this CD. But after I heard the first few songs, I was wondering when they were going to get back to their old swearing, and commical lyrics. It never happened. If your a classic RBF fan, then all your going to get is dissapointment. What happend RBF?"
2,cheer up,"I got this the day it came out and i wasn't too happy. Most of the songs sound way too much like the ones from ""Why do They Rock so Hard"" and but the subjects of the songs aren't funny like RBF usually is. Another reason it doesn't sound like RBF is because they don't use any profanity on this album. Even though I don't think it's that good, if you're a loyal RBF fan, you should still buy it"
2,Cheer up........,"well...It been 4 years since reel big fish have released a NEW full length cd. And in this long waiting period, they have lose many fans, and their style has been changed. The new cd is Pop with horns. (THe SKA is lacking) In every song, they complain about how much they [stink], and how life [stinks]. Ok...I bought that theme for the first cd, and got tired for it in the second. But now it's just getting ridiculous. Some songs are good, but the cd is just plain ANNOYING. So even if you have always liked RBF, this cd is definitely questionable."
5,If You Don't Have This...You're Missing Out!,"The Reel Big Fish is one of the best ska bands...EVER! If you don't own this CD, and you consider yourself a ska fan, you MUST buy Cheer Up!! I've played this CD for many of my friends, and every single person has loved the CD. The songs, no matter what they are singing about, are upbeat and happy. The horns are great! No matter how angry or upset I am, all I have to do is pop in this CD, and I suddenly feel ten times better. I bought this CD about 3 months ago, and it has hardly left my CD player! The best songs are #1, #4, #8, & #9, although it's really hard to single out any songs on this cd. Trust me, normally, when you buy a CD, half the CD sucks, but Cheer Up is an abberation. So...GO BUY CHEER UP! You won't be disapointed!"
4,No Selling Out Here,"This is gonna be short, but I must stress that Reel Big Fish have not sold out. Cheer Up! may not be uber politically driven like all the other new wave punk bands such as Green Day and NOFX, all I can say to this is thank God, I don't want bands to preach to me, I want them to entertain me with their musical talents, as such Reel Big Fish fill this quota, so put that in your pipe and smoke it."
4,cheer up,this cd wasn't there best but it was cool. I hope this cd won't be there last because this isn't the type of going away cd i would have liked it to be.
5,Reel Big Fish Is Back,I ve Been Waiting along time for this album .It seems like it took forever to come out but the end result is awesome.This album goes to show you how much these guys have matured in there song writing as well as there Playing ability(the solo on Rock and Roll Is Bitchin says it all)Proves that they have much greater things coming for them in the near future.
1,BIG DISSAPOINTMENT,"ok so Turn The Radio Off is one of the best Albums I own, its been worn thin 2 times and repurchased each time. They are an awesome band and are amazing to see live... it is total pop and so NOT RBF, there is no fast beat pump you up music, no guitar solos, no real horn section, it has become total pop music"
4,Change isnt always good,"But by no means is this cd bad. it seems that long time labelmates rbf and goldfinger have both decided its time for a change of pace. Although i like goldfinger much better than rbf, i like this cd much better than Open Your Eyes. Sure, there's no more fast-paced ska songs such as Beer and All I want is more. But rbf does keep true to all of the energy they have put in their previous releases, unlike goldfinger. You wont be disappointed you bought this cd, but i recommend you buy their previous releases first (they're much better)"
4,"Great, yet not the best RBF","I have to say after 3 years and changes in the band, it was worth the wait. A truly great cd. Different vocals, guitars, chords, and rhythms than any other ska or rbf cd so far. Recommended for fans and newbie fans of ska. From ""where have you been?"" till the last song, it's truly great. The only song that doesn't really fit in is ""NEw York New York"". WHich is confusing why they put it on the cd, yet it has good signing to it. Out of 10 i would give it an 8."
5,Great action flick,This is a great flick about the strengths and weaknesses of men. This is funny and deadly serious at the same time. Good choice for an action movie.
5,epic,"An epic movie filled with tons of action and suspense while fleshing out a story that, while predictable, is powerful and thematic."
4,Epic.,Great motion picture. Looked good. Mel Gibson as a director has an eye for casting that is his strong suit.
5,Awesome!!!,This is the best movie!!! I have seen it many times and can't wait to see it again...Love it!!!
5,awesome,"Braveheart is a great movie for anyone looking to watch a great movie. Plain and simple, watch it if yoy havent already."
1,"Overly dramatic, historical inaccuracies","This movie borders on the ridiculous. Historically it takes too much license, and while the battle scenes were well done, the script was poor"
5,Great,This movie purchase was for my husband.Great movie at a good price.He was very happy and has viewed it several times.
3,Bloody Goodness,Do you guys know how violent this movie is? It's just like 3 hours of Mel Gibson slaying dudes.Violently. Explicitly. And without remorse for life or limb or even history.And it is awesome. Kind of a boring Bluray though. I would recommend one with more behind the scenes goodies.
3,God for starting GM's or people new to Star Trek,"Ok, don't let the 3 star mark fool you. Any one who is serious about gaming in the Star Trek universe should have this book(if just only for the GM Screen). The book contents, how ever, will be most useful to people who are either new to GMing or new to Star Trek. If you are neither of these, I would suggest getting the other more important books and then this one."
3,Interesting piece of glorification writing,"This well written account is not exactly a historical account, more of a collection of legends and myths, as if it were written by the Chechan ministry of information. This is sort of a classic western view of 'good and evil' and chivalry and savagry and colonialism and resistance. Much like Lawrence of Arabia and his own view of the 'noble savages' he served with. Oddly enough this book is a modern ccreation of the genre, it would be more interesting if it had been written in the 19th century and for that reason one might as well go back to the sources on which it is based such as Tolstoy and Dumas. The modern day terrorists in Gadhestan use these types of legends to excuse their campaigns of ethnic-cleansing and to glorify their modern day massacres at places such as Breslan. It is sad to see a western journalist adding to these excuses.Seth J. Frantzman"
4,Shamyl and the Caucasian Wars,"This is romantic history. Orientals are exotic, Pushkin is swarthy, Germans are militarists and the Russians are, well, Russian. The prose is full of sabres, kinzhals, samovars, mazourkas and limitless steppes. She thinks that shepherds live where there is no vegetation and that the raskolniks were defeated at Poltava, so there must be other mistakes. But it is no worse for that. It is a good read and seems to have most of the facts. This is history as experienced rather than described."
5,My All Time Favorite Childrens Book!,"I Love This Book! I Would read it over and over when I was a child. The story of the old lady and all of the animals she invited to live with her (among them an aligator named Alexander) is wonderful. The illustrations are fabulous and I can picture them to this day. Unfortunatly, I lent my copy to a ""friend"" several years ago to read to her grandson and never got it back. I am currently looking for a copy. I really hope I can find one so I can read it to my children some day."
5,My daughter's favorite book!,"My daughter checked this book out so often from her preschool library we just HAD to purchase it for our library at home! It's a great story about team work and the value of being involved in a community... no matter how big, small... be you an alligator or magic mouse!"
5,One of the Best Children's Books in the World!,"One of the best children's books in the world (along with Lovable Lyle and Moon Mouse!). I first read it as a child of four; I loved to read it when it was raining outside, so I could imagine that I was having the same adventure as Alexander! The characters and illustrations were great! On many occasions, I wanted to leave home to live with the Old Lady and the animals! By far, the best character is the Brindle London Squatting Cat....my kids disagree, their fav character is the Magic Mouse, as she remains invisible to keep the Cat from catching her! Love this book!"
5,A True Classic Bedtime Story,"I love this book! I can distinctly remember reading it from my childhood. Now, I want to read it to my four children and I am trying to get a copy. It is a special book - the story and illustrations are great. I actually can't remember the exact story line - just that I LOVED the book."
5,Way to go Jr!,"After watching this DVD - I can honestly give it the ""Thumbs Up"" for the manner in which Jr. allows us into his ""NASCAR"" life. He truly does give one a feeling for what it takes to succeed with his career choice.The direction of this DVD, the method of filming, and Dale's candid talking to the camera let's anyone even remotely interested in stock car racing get insight into this lifestyle. He comes across as the boy-next-door in a good way....even with all his bleeped cussing! It's good to know that this young man still tries to maintain a ""normal"" lifestyle.Purchase this DVD because you're interested in NASCAR. Purchase this DVD because you're a Jr. Fan. Purchase this DVD to see how a North Carolina Native remains true to his fans and family. Just purchase it!"
5,AWESOME!!!,"If you are a Dale Jr fan,this dvd is for you!! I'm a hardcore fan and I loved this.It shows the other side of Dale off the track,him with his buddies and just hangin out.He lets you into his life which it pretty neat considering not many other drivers have done that.In the hidden footage you even get to see his cat Bud which adorable!!!He shows off his new home and the shop."
2,ENEMA would be better,Ok so it got a bonus star for it being a little good all in all its just Jr. and his life.
4,Not the best but Good,There are many other Charley Pride albums to pick from that will provide you with more songs. This cd has some good ones but being a Charley Pride fan I would recommend it only if you want to collect a large number of his albums. Looks at albums with 20+ songs.
3,A decent text.,This is not a bad text to have in your library but it is a bit rough to follow. Some of the proofs are left out which might otherwise help out understanding.
1,"cryptic, brief, leaves you wanting much more...","Unfortunately, this book was used as the textbook in a mathematical statistics class taught by the author at UC Davis, which I was enrolled in. I found the book to be extremely brief, cryptic, and failed to even begin to explain the subject at hand in any kind of depth. I am an engineering student and am accustomed to technical material. This is the kind of textbook that gives the sciences a bad image. Being rigorous does not imply that you must be cryptic. Statistics is an exciting subject and this book utterly fails to inspire, explain, and enlighten."
3,"Good for first semester, lacking for second semester","This is a well-written guide for a first year law student in their first semester of legal writing. It goes into great detail on writing one's first memorandum, with sections on researching, writing the memo, and a paradigm for how to construct a proof of a conclusion of law. However, once I got to writing my first appellate brief, I found that the book devotes a mere 16 pages to actual writing of the brief. This was extremely lacking and provided very little useful guidance as to this important milestone in a law student's career. I had to buy another book on the subject, doubling my expenditures on legal writing texts."
4,A necessary beginners book to legal writing,A necessary beginners book to legal writing this teaches you how to write all of the necessary legal writing documents with ease.
3,"Another view on ""Sweets for the Sweet""","While I agree in general with the other reviewer, this recording deserves a closer look simply because of Edison's solo work. Granted, Edison is hampered here by the backing of some lethargic strings and some uninspired arrangements but his virtuosity is exemplary even in this contrived setting. For the true Sweets Edison enthusiast, there is plenty of the blues-ridden obligato work that defined his style. You just have to tune out the schmaltzy undercurrent. Not his best effort but it shouldn't be altogether dismissed."
1,Kindle Textbook,Amazon sells this book in the Kindle version in the Kindle store. This format needs work it is not suitable for the Kindle and as a computer download for KindlePC it was awful. We had to return it and rent the book for my daughter. Please work out the bugs as buying textbooks for the Kindle is great.
3,Just Okay,"I'll be completely honest and say I bought this DVD because Cou on the cover looked a little like Edward Elric. Moving on...I wasn't quite as disappointed as I expected to be. After I checked out the artwork inside the case and the back more closely my heart sank because I knew I was in for some very generic fantasy story. Yes, the story and characters are very very typical of what you would expect in a RPG type anime. Surprisingly I sort of enjoyed the first volume. I haven't watched such a simple and innocent fantasy anime in a long time. I find the cliche characters endearing in a way...even though they had me laughing at the cheesiness of the show. All the characters are 'cute' looking especially Cisqua who I instantly fell in love with. I have a thing for girls with guns. Especially big guns. There's really nothing to rave about this volume but it was colorful enough to distract me for a while. Sometimes simple and uncomplicated can be good for the tired soul."
2,Irish Barbie,I was very disappointed in this doll. Does not have much going for it and highly overpriced. She still hasn't been taken out of the box.
1,disappointed,I won't be giving this book to my grandchildren. I have really liked the Woods works previously but find this frightening for children. Too bad- I don't even want to donate it to the library.
1,Bright and Early Thursday Evening,"As a parent and a teacher of young children, I feel that this book is totally inappropriate for the age level 4-8 as directed. I would not recommend it for any age level. In my opinion, it is completely ""off the wall""!"
5,"The book was great, everyone should read it!","The story Bright and Early Tursday Evening is about a girl that woke up and dreamed she was dead. She dressed to go to her funeral.After her funeral a potato from Idaho dropped in.The potato said, ""Let's eat,I'm thirsty."" So she gobbled him down in one bite. A crocodile said ""That sranger was my best friend. ""I didn't do it,"" the girl laughed in remorse, ""And I'll never do it again."" I enjoyed this book because I like tangled tales and I like how the author wrote the book. I would recommend this book to another fourth grade student if they like books about funny stories and tangled tales. If I could change anything I would change the girl eating the potato in one bite. It sounds gruesome and not right.The book was great! Iloved it!! Everyone should read it!!!"
3,"Strange, but I enjoyed it","My 2 year old son wanted this book because of the ""chicken"" on the front. I quickly discovered this is not really a children's story. It's a strange upside down, backwards poem. I found it amusing and enjoyed the creative use of language, but won't be reading it to my son."
2,this book is just weird!,"My children & I LOVED ""the napping house"" -- This is a totally different kind of book. It is a very odd book w/ illustrations that remind me of Salvador Dali. If you liked Nightmare before Christmas -- then this book is probably perfect. Just don't get this one expecting to receive a book similar to ""The napping house"""
3,Ordered wrong item in error,The dictionary was ok however my search was for a french dictiobnary not sure how a regular dictionary popped up and was ordered again I do not like to return so I ended up buying on at a local book store
3,Better choice for 1st graders,"We bought this Smartridge to go along with our son's V-Smile. It is a good game, but I had to rate it 3 stars because of the age recommendation. I bought this for my almost 4 year old son and it is very difficult. It is better suited for 6++ year old children. It goes over math concepts like addition, find the missing integer, etc. Otherwise it is a fun game, I only wished they had included better instructions on how to play some of the games."
4,Great Game for Pre-Schoolers and above,"This game is really great for Pre-Schoolers and above. I bought it for my son when he was 3 and a half. He had a hard time with it because it had areas that he didn't know were off-screen (garbage collecting portion). The factory portion was really hard for anyone younger than 5 because the battery match-up you have to understand and know patterns really well. It is a great game for kids in Kindergarten and for kids who pick up details really well. It seems to start out like the whole game will be easy for a younger kid, but then it picks up into harder games."
5,It's Grrrrreat,My son love's Spider Man and to own his very own V Smile Smartridge is not only fun but very educational. He has most of the Smartridge cassettes and thanks to them and has a big jump start towards kindergarten.
4,Great Product,"My son loves this game, he is really learning a lot, and I like to sit and play it with him! Keeps us interacting together while he is learning. Great Product!!"
3,sounds like elvis,"cd has 15 tracks by various elvis imitators such as Jimmy Velvit & Gene Summers. Some of the tracks are ""Rockin' With Elvis"" ""Goodbye Priscilla"" and ""Elvis Stole My Gal"" Not bad for the price."
1,WARNING: ENTRIES OUTDATED AND NOT QUITE RIGHT,"This title has two disvantages: there is a lot of information that is not referenced and that there is other which is completely outdated. Surely, I will not recommend this one for any newcomer and much less for any professional in the field. Illustrations are the only interesting thing in this title, and not so much so. Look for other ""dictionaries"" on Egyptian religion if you really want to know..."
5,Wonderfully surprised,"When I received my order I could not believe my eyes. The bible was so beautiful I was amazed, so much so that I ordered the only other copy for my son and his family. If there had been more I would have ordered them as well for other members of my family and friends."
5,Wonderful product and great customer service,I was thrilled to receive this beautiful Bible as it is a wedding gift for my daughter. The entire book is gorgeous and this is something that she will treasure and keep for a lifetime. It came with a picture frame and plenty of room for keeping family records. It is easy to read and has an elegant over-all presentation. The seller delivered all that she promised and more!
2,Worthless,"Most of the material seems to be borrowed from other sources and the writing style is beyound basic. This chiropractor assumes that people can not get past his antiquated ""research"". I would not waste the 30 minutes it takes to read this book, which it looks like no one else is."
5,Real healthcare!,Every parent should read this. Dr. Ressel is inspirational; his book causes you to think! He and MANY chiropractors avoid vaccination...and I get it...drugs are not the answer to everything!
4,Good piece of hardware,"This is a good piece of hardware. But a couple of things to be aware of: 1) This is a ""tapered"" jig. So if you look carefully on the front right side of the male slot, you'll see it's about 1/8"" narrower than the left side. This is how it gets one side tighter than the other. One side slides in easily and eventually gets tighter as the male part gets increasingly wider. 2) Pay particular attention to making sure your M and F pieces align on the left side and that your boards are the same width. This important for achieving the tight fit at the other end of your boards. (I first did a test cut using 2 different widths of boards, and they didn't fit, and I freaked...at first)I agree with other writers that the whole OmniJig could use a major upgrade, putting precision adjustment knobs instead of trial and error stop blocks for example, would really help....Tom O'Brien...All Quality Woodworking"
1,Disappointing Picture Quality,"I bought this camera last summer to replace an old Olympus APS camera that I'd had stolen. I went with this Canon APS because I had always been very happy with the APS picture quality, ease of picture taking and because I've liked the quality of Canon products in general in the past. This camera has been nothing but a disappointment. My pictures are grainy; the colors are washed out; the world through the shutter of this camera is drab, dull and blurry. I've tried everything from adjusting the film speed I'm using to switching who I use as a developer...The results are always the same when I get my prints back. Do not make the same mistake I did and waste your money on this camera."
2,Out-of-Focus,The photos from the first roll came out great in terms of color and focus. But the last 2 rolls have produced mostly out-of-focus photos so I'm very disappointed right now. Hope most of you are having better luck with this specific camera.
2,miss,"not all the functions advertised were available. for instance, the ""mid-roll change"" does NOT work. another, the manual focus is NOT available at all."
2,default to panoramic,"I bought this camera because my old Kodak Advantix stopped working. I loved the size and style of the Elph, but everytime I took a close-up photo, the camera defaulted to panoramic size. At first I thought the camera was defective, so I exchanged it for another one, and the same thing kept happening. I asked the developer, and they said it has nothing to do with the developing process. I am not sure if this is true or not, and Canon doesn't mention this default factor in the manual. After wasting several rolls of film, I finally returned the Elph and got another Kodak Advantix camera. The pictures that did develop normally were sharp and clear however, and I would have liked to keep the Elph if not for the unpredictability of the sizes that came out."
2,Disappointing,"The camera has the virtues and vices of the APS system--It is small and convenient to carry, has multiple picture size options, and is easy to use. But I am very unhappy with the picture quality compared with my ELPH LT Sport. The pictures are a bit blurry in comparison. It may matter to some that when you remove a film cartridge, the roll is set to ""exposed"", so you can't switch film speeds without sacrificing the remaining shots on the roll being removed. Not an awful camera, but not the best. I purchased this camera to replace my stolen ELPH 370, and am less satisfied with it than with my older camera."
2,give me a break,"If the reader above is such a layman and doesnt even havea job, then how can she write such an outstanding reveiwfor the 2 star book. how bogus."
5,Lea Symbols Near Vision Chart,"This is a great little product, very handy to carry with you from school to school for quickly checking young children's vision. Accurate and at a good price! Highly recommended!"
5,Please Please Give Us What We Want!!!!,"Oh Eugene,Is that really you typing that review of your own music?? Give us more, make it true. We love it so and would love something new.. Anything. This is classic stuff. Get it and be saved!!Please record more...wherever and however...Eugenuis or Captain America or Vaselines!! With Love, Travis"
5,Rides me Raw,"I love this album...thank you kurt cobain for yet another great band I found through you..like the Raincoats and on an on. The songs on this album are so fun, so right on and so easy to get stuck in your head. ""The Day I Was a Horse"" and ""monsterpussy"" are two songs I find end up on almost every tape I make to listen to in my car. Perfect to listen to while up to no good."
4,Scottish Piss 'n Vinegar,"The music of The Vaselines probably would've never been released on CD has Kurt Cobain not been such a big fan but, like Half Japanese and Daniel Johnston, The Vaselines were finally unleashed on the masses in the early 1990. Thank God! It would've been a crying shame to have ignored great sloppy noisy pop nuggets like these. The songs are short, catchy and are both cute and psycho at the same time. The Day I Was a Horse, Slushy, Son of a Gun, Rory Ride Me Raw... If you like The Pastels, Teenage Fanclub, Jesus and Mary Chain, pratical jokes or breathing, chances are, you'll enjoy The Vaselines."
4,wonderful indie pop,"This is great British pop in the tradition of Lush and St. Etienne. If Evan Dando and Julianna Hatfield were suddenly transported back to California in the late '60s, this is the kind of goofy but well-crafted hippie pop/folk that they would have come up with. Great stuff."
5,music for thee that requiers pepto bismol afterwards.,"That's right. This band the vaselines make me ill in the stomache and everywhere else,but thats a cool thing though knowing that there is only one other band i can think of that makes me want to vomitt,and that band is nirvana.I dont know what it was exactly that made kurt like the vaselines i guess it could probably lead down to the simple fact that the vaselines are a raw band. If i were to ever get a record deal i would do the same thing take two or three songs from a band i liked and redue them. In my case the band i would probably cover would be the cars, i would take the songs just what i needed,my best friends girl ,and tonight she comes and add a little distortion and get my other guitaris to play the lead parts that the cars keyboard player plays. But back on the story of the vaselines yes! they in my oppinion are one of the best punk bands and they have one of the most raw sound you could imagin."
3,Real weird :-?,"This band is basically a really weird soft-punk band who get publicity coutesy of Curt Kobain. They're a good band, like someone else said really bored teenagers with some cool ideas. I particularly like the last track, it has a folky but driving beat and a wailing guitar tone. No hope is also a good track and there are some nice 'silly' pop songs, like dum-dum and Oliver twist. Some of the songs are (deliberately) blasphemous, but not many. You can skip 'em over and there's a lot to choose from with 19 songs in total. I also want to give a shout to 'hairy', great song. The vocals are acutally good, too. None of that wailing, affected screeching, just simple folk-singing."
5,Best Product,"I've used this leather conditioner for years and it is an excellent product. Easy to apply and does a wonderful job protecting and making the leather look very nice. I use it on my dress shoes, motorcycle boots and leather coats. A little goes a long way and I consider it a very good value. Will buy this product again and again. Shipped very quickly as well."
5,The Queen of salsa,Its just the best but I'm bias I love Celia wish more people would its typical Celia and great.
1,Cheap knock-off,It's a cheap version of the real Apple armband. It looks cheap and feels cheap. I returned mine.
4,not bad,"not a bad product, the top of the ipod hangs out, which sucks if ur not carful but armband is very comfortable and for the price, you cant beat it!"
3,Generally good but igniter broke.,"Whether you are using this torch in you workship or in the kitchen to make creme broulet the torch can be set to do the job. It also includes a soldering attachment to use as a pointed soldering iron when needed. My problem with the torch is the the piezo igniter stopped working after about 6-8 ignitions. I have not yet investigated why, but it may have been damaged by the heat of the torch. In the meantime, I have used a Bic lighter to start it. After that it is not problem. I will probably send it back but I threw out the packageing so it may be a problem. I think this is a good torch for the money even if the igniter does not fuction but I only rate it 3 strars because of the malfunction that happen so soon after the torch was purchased. Hopefully others will not have the experience I have had."
2,Second unit craps out? Don't buy it.,"We've been through two of these micro torches, and both have failed! The only thing more disappointing about their premature failure (8 months each of light jewelry usage) is the idiotic web site, which used to be pretty good.I can't believe there's no support section! There's no troubleshooting guide, no FAQ, no manuals, no forums or other usage data of any kind! Perhaps someone told them that plumbers don't use websites? Then why all the fancy flash and catalog work, but the outright removal of important data?Maybe they can say why, but my take is that they stupidly think they own this market and don't have to do any support work. Bad move.David Smith"
1,The Worse,"I have this Lion King V smile Smartridge my four year old Daughter it doesn't keep her interest at all. It's to slow and it has nothing to do but jump over logs there's no animals like in the movie, the harder level is just the same as the easy version I wish I could get my money back, future purchaser the game that comes with it is great that is the best one for your little ones to grow with.Signed Take my advise Please"
1,Amazon Needs To Get Their Crowbars Straight,"Ok, I don't have this album and only put a star there to have my say.The problem is there are two Crowbars and they are very different.The album cover in this listing is from the 1973 Crowbar, by the Canadian blues/country rock band. Amazon lists some of their albums under Crowbar '70's. But there have been some re-releases in the 90's, which can be confusing.But the song listing here is for the contemporary American doom metal band Crowbar. Anyone expecting one and getting the other would be very disappointed.I want this particular Canadian Crowbar album that is pictured. How about it Amazon, can you sell me this one?"
1,WAY OVERPRICED!,I bought this and was not impressed with the cream. I than saw Eye Revival on Amazon and how similar it was but it was over $70 CHEAPER!!! I have since bought Eye Revival and have been happy with the results but really happy that I paid A LOT less. Try Eye Revival instead and save yourself time AND money! You will not be disappointed!
2,Single-minded pursuit of a goal,"I was struck continuously with Parker's unchanging selfishness. The entire expedition nearly died just to reach HIS goal. He defies the police to enter forbidden mountain areas, ends up getting the entire expedition lost and his best guide nearly dies as Parker drags him over mountain passes in single-minded pursuit of Parker's goal. Even at the end, he casts aside a woman he loves because he deems their cultures ""too different"" and, although he thinks she may be able to cope with the differences, he admits it is he who cannot. Nothing seems to reach this guy. He's determined to have life meet his expectations, no matter what cost."
1,Try other Amazon books on wicca,"The spells do not work. Furthermore, it is unethical to cast ""revenge"" spells...and don't be fooled by the title, there is no actual spell here that tells how to turn anyone into a toad."
4,"How to Turn Your Ex-Boyfriend into a Toad: And Other Spells for Love, Wealth, Beauty and Revenge","This is such a fun book! It has some practical and some not-so-practical spells in it for all occasions. Best for people who have a bit of backgroud with already knowing how to cast a circle and do their own rituals. These, to me are like ""the cherry on top"". Great book, quick read."
4,A cute view to Magick,I Thought its was great especially when you touch the star to make the book's powers yours and yours only. Its a great pick me up when you've just broken up with your boyfriend or if your down on your luck. Whether or not the spells work is up to you.
1,I am being nice by giving it one star!,"I do admit, I have never read it. And I dont mean to be critical, but I am going to be. The title,to turn your ex-boyfriend into a frog, that is wrong, no witch would do that, because, to any witch, it is common knowlegde, any spell casted comes back to you 3 times the power, I dont even want to read this, I have better things to do!"
5,The spells will do it all...,"Ibought this book in june and now, i am a self confident woman, i trust myself, others and i feel better about myself...i got rid of my neighbor, my pet is now my best friend and i am more powerfull then ever...athena and Deborah, thanks, i owe you one...."
3,Got it for my wife.,She wanted it...I got it...I think she enjoys it. I am only writing this cause I have to.
2,"Just a rong, messed up ripoff","This is just a stupid view of the bibel. It`s not only for idiots, its main message seems to be ""God will do your bidding, but u hav to be evil first, and then u go to hell. Plus, it has to hav the name it has. I thought it meant the bord game, not a book. If u r thinking about buying it, DON`T!It`s a waste of$."
1,misguided,"This is a seriously warped cherry picked view of the bible. In some aspects she will chose a quote which fits her view, but then contradicts the bible completely. I am only a new christian but i can see how a book which denounces the existence of the devil or talks about reincarnation is seriously misguided. I am not being insensitive to those who say it has helped them but i would suggest the best thing to do it pick up a bible and learn the truth."
5,My Apology to Hay House Classics,"I wish to retract the comments I previously made on the ""package statement"" I previously submitted. Since the arrival time of my order was long over-due, I was quick to react and fault Hay House. The US Postal ""Service"" is surely at fault for apparently misplacing this as well as other mail due me. My apologies to Hay House.Sincerely,Louis Arnone"
1,The game Of Life and How to Play It,"Simple comment, The Game Of LIfe and How to Play it According to ""Jesus"".... This needs to be know before the product is purchased."
2,Not what I needed.,I got bored about 1/4 way through the book and stopped reading. The book did not teach me the lessons I need to advance in life.
4,Well written ancient principles,"I enjoyed the book and thought it was well written. However, it was smaller than what I expected it to be. I have enjoyed sharing some of the principles of the Game of Life with others."
3,Play on Player,"A timeless classic The Game of Life and how to play it by Florence Scovel Shinn shares insight into daily living.Centering on the power of intention, this book uses the analogy as a game in dealing with life's hills and valleys. Through selfless love and devotion, one can make it through any crisis.Broken down into many short chapters, The Game of Life and how to play it by Florence Scovel Shinn gives you a guide in empowering you to achieve your dreams. With Christian guidance it makes anyone a believer in the world of possibility."
3,Size of the print.,"I was a little disappointed in the fact that the print is so small. It is not really easy to read. However, the content I give a 5 star rating. I would suggest getting the book THE WISDOM OF FLORENCE SCOVEL SHINN,this has 4 complete books by Mrs. Shinn."
4,Great book,I bought the book for only 1 cent. It came in very good conditions and I am enjoying reading it....
3,Positive thinking brings material rewards,"The main gist of Scovel-Shinn's philosophy is ""positive thinking"". So long as you think positively and avoid doing evil, you'll get everything you want, especially money. I say ""especially money"" because most of her examples involve people needing and getting money.I guess it's okay to be money-oriented, but there are other more important facets in life that she did not discuss as fully. Thus the diminished ratings."
2,Condition of book,the condition of the bookwas poor would not recommend seller. the book itself is very very good and would recommend purchasing from different seller
3,The original,"This book is the original for those interested in the Secrets of Attraction. It was written in the 1920s and sounds stilted because of that. The information is nothing new if you've read other books about Secrets of Attraction, but it is the first."
5,"An excellent ""How to"" Life book",This book is wonderfully simple and explains clearly the best ways to get what you want out of life. Not only that...it's short :}Heidi Wooten
2,just bad,"A book on wishful thinking,offering no real advice but to have faith (mostly in Gods plan) . Being an atheist myself, I can't believe it is so praised, since all it does is advise positive thinking and references lucky coincidences of questionable validity."
2,"The Game of Life And How ""JESUS"" Plays it.","I agree there are many good beliefs and teachings in this book (which I will take to my heart), but the concepts are too religious for me. I consider myself f to be Pagan, I believe in a higher power, the power of one's mind and nature, but to bring Jesus and bible verses into every sentence is too much for me. If I would've known this book is so heavily based on Christianity I would I would've bothered with it."
5,Enlightening.,"Love her writings. A very easy, yet informative read. Very thought provoking and enlightening. A must read for anyone wanting to improve their quality of life."
1,Bummer Bird Bath,The coating did not last and just peeled off. Now I just have a plain black pastic thingy but I still put water in it for the birds. Now they can skate around on it.
2,A disappointing collection,I should have read closer what songs were included. A disappointing collection of a fading stars' not so super hits. Better videos/bigger hits can be seen online.
5,YAY!!,this is an great Barbie....it show how ancient Chinese dressed....now they need babies from all regions of the world
1,HEARTBREAKING,"If you are a Clint Walker fan, don't watch this movie. It is unbearably heartbreaking and painful to watch."
3,Clint Walker,I LOVE Clint Walker which is the only reason that I ordered this movie since he did not make that many. I was disappointed - it was weird with no plot
2,I WAS IN 6TH GRADE WHEN I SAW THIS,"OH BOY ..BACK THEN IT WAS THE COOLEST MOVIE I EVER SAW AND THE BLOODIEST. LIKE WHEN VINCENT PRICE GETS BLOWN AWAY. BUT NOW I AM OLDER, I SAW IT AGAIN, IT DID NOT DO A THING FOR ME. IT WAS LIKE THE TITLE IMPLIES THE MOVIE WAS ""MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE"". IT WAS NOT THE ONLY MOVIE THAT HAS DONE THAT TO ME. TUNNELVISION WAS ANOTHER ONE I THOUGHT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING IN THE 70'S ...I RESAW IT NOT LONG AGO AND THOUGHT...WHAT WAS I THINKING?"
1,More Dead Than Alive,Great movie but this version was edited....I do not know why big studios like MGM would release an edited version of a movie...
1,Would have been fantastic if it had fit,"At first look, this seems to be a fantastic bath bench. It appears very sturdy and easy to use. Unfortunately, the description of the item is WAY off. It will not ""fit a 19""-28"" bathtub."" The smallest width it would fit is 28"". Had it fit, I think I would have been extremely pleased with the product. But since I was not able to use it with my 24"" bathtub, I had to return the item and seek a different bath seat."
3,BIG,Much bigger then I thiught it was. It almost wont fit the tub and Will not fit near the ends.But strudy and secure. Easy to remove
2,Unable to use because of tub design,"The product itself is of nice quality, however I haven't been able to use it. This bench requires a tub that has a ledge on both sides. Most newer tubs do not have that ledge against the wall, so there is nowhere for that side of the bench to rest on the tub. My recommendation is to check to make sure your tub will accomodate this type of bench before you purchase it. I know now I needed a bench with legs on it. Just something to consider."
2,Not as advertised,"Although this product seemed sturdy enough, it did NOT fit my ""standard"" size bathtub. I called the manufacture directly and was informed that the ""front"" of the tube was too wide (3.5"" to 4""). The bench would not adjust for this width. The advertisement did not mention this, which I think is an important measurement to mention. This is the first item I've ever had to return to Amazon.com. Which buy-the-way was very easy. I purchased a tub chair instead which worked out perfectly (also from Amazon.com)."
1,Bad all around,"I received this as a gift because my little boy's name is Alexander. I think it's poorly written and poorly drawn. My husband and I are not ""PC freaks"", but we are both disgusted by how violent and rude the fruits are to each other. The nutritional information is also not accurate. Since when are oranges a source of calcium to any meaningful degree?"
2,The Psychology of Facial Expression,I was hoping for many more pictures to illustrate body language. This would be a good book if I was writing a Thesis on the subject and needed references.
4,REALLY 4 1/2,"I also like the other reviewer found this to have some hiss to it. But not that bad, the quality of the music out weighs the hiss. His guitar playing is excellent like always along with his vocals, also great song selection and the songs are all very long another plus. These are all early live recordings, so the good points out weigh the bad, so try it I think you will agree."
2,Confusing Directions,"The other review is right. I bought this product specifically to do box joints and finally gave up after three hours. It is fairly easy to set up and nicely made. I have not tried the dovetail joint template yet, so maybe it is better. But please, someone at Porter Cable re-write those directions. They are not very clear. For example, there are six bolts used in the construction of the jig. Two are shorter than the others. No mention of this in the directions or where to put them. Also the lock nuts used to secure the templates do not move easily. I switched them with the regular nuts. But there is no mention of how to secure the template with those locking nuts in the directions. Had to figure that for myself. Most of the products in my shop are from Porter Cable but this item probably should not have been one of them."
3,Mediocre,"This jig works fairly well once you get everything aligned. The problem is it's a pain to get everything aligned. There are no measurement markings, gauges or guides to help line things up. Additionally, the directions are absolutely horrible.It comes with a non-carbide dovetail bit and Porter Cable compatible template guide. I'd prefer not to have paid for either one of them since I did not need them.The front and top clamps are tightened with knobs instead of cam levers (like the more expensive jigs) and it is easy to scrape or pinch your fingers while tightening either of the front two knobs. The clamps are also made of thin metal which bends too easily.Although this jig is somewhat cheaper than the high-end jigs, I really don't feel like I got much for my money."
4,setup and instructions,"Once the product was out of the box, the assembly instructions were fair, they weren't the greatest. I was making nice fitting joints in less than 30 minutes. Unless you have some decent mechanical skills, the directions for assembling the jig can be better. Once set up correctly I did encounter a problem with the jig's edge guide moving on me. To keep any settings from moving on you, I highly recommend that you use some Locktite on the bolts and the nuts since there is no actual mechanical locking devices there. Other than the corrected problems I found the jig to be dollar for dollar a fine value."
4,Porter Cable's 4112 is made by Hart Design Tools-Mystery Answered,"Exerpt from Hart Design Tools:Featured in numerous articles and reviews, Hart Design's ""Made in the USA"" GFK1200 (also made and sold as the Porter-Cable 4112) has become the industry standard for accurate and affordable dovetailing. It's big brother, the GFK1800, gives woodworkers even bigger capacity for all their joint making needs. Whether it's half-blind dovetails, rabbeted half-blind dovetails, through-dovetails, or box joints, the Hart Design GFK series of jigs can do them all."
1,Poorly designed and manufactured!,"Well I bought because of the Porter Cable name. Problems appeared around the 5th drawer...the problem is due to the poorly manufactured left side adjustment bracket, it's only held in place by one poorly located screw, the bracket flexes enough to create a bunch of problems. The second problem with the jig is in the clamp down plastic knobbed clamps (2 of them stripped out) and the clamp is not hefty enough to hold work pieces in place...I suspect the plastic knobs stripped because the clamp flexed enough. Save your money and avoid this product. It's time consuming to setup and frustrating to keep it aligned. I've designed tools over my life time and this is an example of how a pretty simple jig can be messed up by improper selection of materials and poor execution in the manufacturing and test of a product. Oh, and my experiences with the random orbit palm sander by Porter Cable...uugggghhhhh!"
3,heads up to bosch owners,"This looks like a great jig, esp. for the price. But I won't know for another two weeks because I need a special templet guide for my router! Before you buy, look at your router and determine if it accepts the p-c templet guide. I own a bosch, and I love it, but it requires either an adaptor (to use the included p-c part) or a special bosch templet guide. This shouldn't be a deal breaker for anyone who's into tools, but you should know ahead of time to avoid delays and disappointment."
4,Dont listen to bargain bob,"I'm not quite sure what Bargain Bob is talking about, but he describes thin unit (and a film scanner) as the poor mans digital camera. With the price of the camera plus the scanner, you could purchase a very nice didgtal camera, so don't fall into that trap. If you want film, buy a film camera, if you want digital, but a digital camera...don't just get a scanner."
1,EOS IX Lite vs EOS IX,Bought a EOS IX lite originally - had lousy pictures - was going to give up on the APS system - but then saw on EBAY the EOS IX ( not lite )and gave that a try - WOW! the difference is incredible. The pictures were sharp and clear - my advice is to NOT buy the EOS IX lite but rather find an old EOS IX - you will not be sorry.
5,Fido Fleece for dogs is the best!,This is my third purchase of fido fleece for my dogs and I love the quality. Fido fleece is the only dog coat with the velco down the back of the coat. This makes it so much easier to put it on a squirming dog! It can go right over their harnesses or I can use a collar instead. They have no problem going pee or poo while wearing their coats. The coats give them plenty of room to move around. My dogs don't like the sound of the velco when I take the coat off of them but that is the only bad thing I can say about this product. It's a great product and I highly recommend it if your looking for a warm coat for your best friend!
3,Well made but...,"Very well made, love the fabric and design but the sizing is all wrong. I contacted the company before buying with my dog's measurements and they said to go with the girth size. Well the girth size is ok but the coat is way too short - makes her look like she's wearing a monkey suit! And the size that is larger is only 2 inches longer which won't really make all that difference. My dog is a mutt, she's a normal shaped dog, neither elongated nor stout. Needless to say I'm quite disappointed, I was so looking forward to keeping her warm and snug with this coat."
5,The river between us,"This book is great example of historical fiction. I would recommend that people (kids especially) read past chapter one, before deciding they don't like the book. Chapter one can be construed as ""boring,"" but wait till you get to Chapter two when the real story begins"
4,The River Between Us,"The River Between Us is a novel by Richard Peck. It's a historical fiction that takes place mostly in the year 1861, in a place called Devil's Back, Illinois.The main character is a girl named Tilly, who's telling her grandson about when she was 16, during the Civil War. Their state is divided into two sections, The Yankees and The Republicans. Two mysterious, very wealthy people, Delphine and Calinda, come to stay with Tilly and her family. The neighbors say that they are spies. When Tilly's twin, Noah, goes off to the war, their mother sends her off to find him. She says that she can spare Tilly, but she can't spare Noah.There are many mysteries that are later uncovered that were absolutely surprising to me. It's a great book for everyone. The River Between Us contains love, friendship, and hard times. Overall, this book was a really good book that's hard to put down."
5,A great book,"Richard Peck is a wonderful writer, and this is one of his best. It's a look at one of America's most famous events from a completely different perspective. The women from New Orleans grab you and don't let go. I enjoyed it so much, I've given copies as gifts."
5,unigue and interesting historical,I thought this idea was really interesting. the mytery of the two young women who comne to stay during the war. It was really good. sometimes richard peck writes sort of a group of stories like in year down yonder. but in this book its more like a novel and I like that better personlally. And for those who like interesting Historical fiction read also Prairie Whispers . It's super.
2,A boring book with a useless plot.,"""The River Between Us"" is the third book I've read by author Richard Peck. The previous two were ""Amanda Miranda"" and ""Fair Weather: A Novel."" I disliked both tremendously, so I didn't have too high of hopes for this book. The summary of ""The River Between Us"" sounded intriguing and full of mystery, yet neither of those elements surfaced within the book. Peck's writing style is staccato and bland, and I couldn't warm up to any of the characters. I was often confused, and I had to reread the first chapter to understand the last chapter. I truly feel this book was an utter waste of time. I do not recommend."
1,BORING,I only read the first eleven pages because the book was so HORRIBLE. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. ITS REALLY ZERO STARS!
4,The River Between Us,"A little muddy town in Illinois is home to Tilly Pruitt, whose life changes when two women from New Orleans unexpectedly come to live with her poor family. The women's names are Delphine and Calinda. Months later, Tilly's brother Noah sneaks away to fight in the Civil War. After Tilly's mother falls ill, she orders Tilly to bring Noah home. Tilly and Delphine set off on this quest for the rest of the book. Through Delphine, Tilly learns about life in New Orleans and how racist people can be.I liked that this book was very descriptive, was suspenseful, and made you feel like you were in the story. I disliked that at times I couldn't tell when or where the story was taking place. I would recommend this book for people who like serious books with little humor."
5,A must-have for all Titanic lovers,"I hadn't even finished looking through this wonderful collection before having to quickly sign on and place my review here! What a surprising, impressive, and very authenticated collection. The box itself is a replica of a small steamer trunk. Inside, the treasures are truly wonderous! There is nothing cheap here. The postcards, the booklets, the ship's plans--some of the postcards have original writings and postmarks on them. Notice the water spots on some, indelibly marked and haunting to look at. The materials used to create these momentos are thick and sturdy cardboard-like; nothing flimsy in this little trunk. The ""Notes"" booklet is fascinating itself...I felt as if I had truly boarded this ill-fated steamer, and wished to rent a rug and deck chair upon arrival to my cabin!"
5,The best daily tea,"Love this stuff. Great price. After a fair amount of comparison drinking, I've come to the conclusion that PG Tips is the tea for me."
5,English Tea,My son went to England and brought back this tea. I fell in love with it and could not find it here in Florida. Amazon!!! and the price was great and I just love my PG Tips Tea.
2,Bought For my Dorm Room,"I bought this for my dorm room for my six suite mates and I, but we barely use it. It'd be great for the work place, but it's just too much tea for us!"
1,Bought on may 15 and haven't received it yet,"PG Tips Black Tea, Pyramid Tea Bags, 240-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)(Purchased on May 15, 2012)by PG TipsHaven't received my product yet, and it's been 3 1/2 months since i bought it.Can i get my money back?"
1,Little Tiny Ice Cubes,"You will need 3 of these ice cube trays to equal a regular ice cibe tray. Two iced dinks and you're out of these little tiny ice cubes.Too much space taken up for minimal ice cubes, look for something else."
1,Bad design,After a lot of shaking the ice cubes still didn't come loose. Just stick with the conventional trays and don't waste your money with this.
3,Functional but smelly,"I do like how the eye pillow works but I really wish there was a removable cover. The scent at first is great but quickly fades and then has a strange odor. I had some essential oils so I put a few drops of lavender on the edges and then worked the eyebag in hopes of revitalizing the nice original scent. It worked for awhile and then started smelling strange again. I knew the smell would diminish but I hoped it would end up with little to no scent...not the ""barn"" type scent it has. it is not awful just a little strange."
5,Great Eyebags,"I get frequent headaches/migraines, when I feel one coming on I lay down for a short nap with the hugger mugger eyebag over my eyes and I find it to be very soothing. The scent of the herbs is not overwhelming. It also helps when I can't sleep, I put it on and within minutes I'm fast asleep"
4,Terrific,"I love this eyebag. It smells wonderful and works well hot or cold. Also, the weight is just right. My only complaint is I wish you could remove and wash the cover."
5,I love it,I love this eye bag. It's the perfect size. It's smells so good and relaxing and is so soft. It arrived quickly without problems. If anyone wants one this is the one to get.
4,Featured Track!!,"For some reason, this page doesn't include the description of the most important track on this item. This CD features the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky. But nowhere is that mentioned on this page..."
5,Canon Rebel 2000,This Camera takes incredible pictures. It has a wide range of shutter speeds rangeing from 2000 to bulb. plus hte 7 point auto focus syste is hand in most situations. Plus it is very light making it easy to carry around.
4,Hmmm - Not Blu-Ray and Maybe Better To Wait For the Entire Series?,"This is a terrific temptation, especially if you don't already own any of the series DVDs. After all, how tempting is it to have 5 seasons worth of episodes instantly available! So much better than buying individual episodes and cheaper than buying each year separately. It is an incredibly long stretch between seasons, and a 5-year set provides a lot of viewing!The downside, and the reason for 4 stars, is that at this point, it would be better to buy the series in Blu-Ray, as the HD format wars are over, and with the final season coming, it seems sort of weird to buy such a ""so close but yet so far"" set. Still, the Blu-Ray point is stronger. I think I would regret not having an HD version in a year or two. Come on, Eileen - where's the Blu-Ray version!?"
5,Ronnie Dove's velvet touch makes for enjoyable music.,"This double c.d. is a re-issue of two Ronnie Dove 1960's albums.Here are 22 tracks of relaxing, easy listening music.Four songs made the pop chart from these two albums.Those are here, and 6 b-sides.1. ""One kiss for old time sake"" -- 1965. (a-side)2. ""A little bit of heaven"" b/w ""If I live to be a hundred"" -- 1965.3. ""I'll make all your dreams come true""b/w ""I had to lose you (to find that I need you) -- 1961.4. ""Kiss away"" b/w ""Where in the world"" -- 1965.5.

All original recordings."
3,Really 3 1/2 Stars!,"I like this author. I read ""All Fall Down"", which was thoroughly enjoyable, unique, and intelligently written. This book is the same, just not quite as. Again, his writing is so intelligent and insightful, and this is what escalates this novel to a higher realm. This is a good story, a good read, and has plenty of twists. Definitely recommend it, especially if you like this author."
1,Don't bother.,"Unless you like reading technical manuals, you will not find much of interest in this book."
4,Classic Sub Pop,"The Fluid is one of the most palatable early Sub Pop bands, blending up-tempo 70s-rock riffs with catchy pop melodies. They sound very much like Bleach-era Nirvana (in fact, the two bands released a split single on Sub Pop). If you are seriously interested in the late 80s Sub Pop sound, the Fluid is a band to check out (even though they are from Denver, not Seattle!)"
1,Wrong Specification Size,Which is correct the title size 9 x 14 or the specification size 6 x 12???????
2,Kinda weak,"This is the first review I submit to this site. I read a good deal of fiction (much more amusing than real life) and I have to say though the settings are interesting, character developemnt is trite."
5,Special Barbie,This is a lovely Barbie Doll that commemorates the Salt Lake City Olympics. Quite different! Not a toy. Made for collectors.
1,Cables,Connected this cable to my TV and to a HDMI Sat. Receiver. Worked fine to begin with then the colors went crazy and stayed with the wrong color and bad image. Cable was well constructed but something caused problems. When things went funny the audio went off and would not come back on through that cable.
2,Producto barato = Pobre desempeño,"efectué la conexión de mi tarjeta de vídeo GEFORCE 8800 a un LCD OLEVIA de 26"" por el puerto HDMI y obtuve un pobre desempeño. Terminé efectuando la conexión por video compuesto y guardando el cable en la bodega."
4,"A very well written fantasy epic, spanning generations.","i enjoyed the book and the series immensly, however I thought that the ending left things unsaid and undone. hopefully Ann Marston will write a sequel series. that would really impress me."
2,Standard,"Entertaining, but the main failing of Broken Blade is that it is exactly like too many other sci-fi/fanatsy novels available today. Browsing through the sci-fi/fantasy section of a bookstore is bewildering - there are so many hundreds of books entitled ""Dragonmaker"", ""Sword of Light"", and such that you don't know where to turn. I've read too many other fantasy novels with plotlines and characters all extremely similar to this one. It was fairly enjoyable, but do yourself a favor and don't buy it. Check it out from the library."
4,"Good, but not great","This book, the last in the Rune Blade Trilogy, is a satisfying conclusion to the series. After what I thought was a poor second novel, Marston is back to her best. This series is recommended, but know that when you read the first book you're reading the best one. Broken Blade is certainly interesting, and a fun read, but it lacks enough detail and depth. She could really do a lot more with these stories. Still, her works are enjoyable, and the world she has created is an interesting one, so I look forward to the next books set in the same world."
4,A thoroughly entertaining read,"I enjoyed this book; in fact, the entire trilogy captured all my reading time, something unusual as I am usually reading a half dozen or more books at once. I found the series to be very well-written, with outstanding pacing that reminded me of Goodkind's Sword of Truth series.I can't say that this is a hauntingly beautiful book, though. It's not one of those few (Tigana instantly comes to mind) that will linger on my mind forever. But I'm not sure I'd want all books to be like that. Instead, this trilogy is just tremendously great fun. If you buy them, be prepared to dive in and be entertained. You'll not be disappointed."
3,Disappointed!,"I just have to say that I was disappointed with the conclusion of this trilogy. I bought all three books and expected to just read three books! It is a great story, but I just can't help feeling let down. I don't feel like there was any conclusions at all in this book considering it's the last in the trilogy. Now I have to get the next trilogy (was that the plan all along?) - and from what I can tell, only 2 books are out so far which means i have to wait for yet another series to finish - the reason I started this one is because I like finished series."
5,"Terrific book, engaging characters","Probably my favorite thus far. Marston does a wonderful job with her characters, making them vivid and alive.Unlike some authors whose characters are one dimentional. Characters so well done that they ""spill"" into later books. Her books are always a joy to read, the only ""fault"" is that I wish she could write them even faster than she does!"
5,"""Clearing"" a Springboard","Clearing the Bases obviously encompassed an enormous amount of research, & consideration as to what that research offered. It was the springboard for a great discussion among several friends who are baseball enthusiasts. Thanks, Mr. Barra, for a grand evening!"
3,A sabermatrician's wet dream,"I don't participate in fantasy baseball but I do appreciate the amount of research Allen Barra has put into this book. Part of the intrigue of any sports books like this is the inevitability of more arguments, counterarguments and rebuttals. I agree with some of his points, his defense of Jackie Robinson as a Hall of Fame 2nd baseman on just his statistics, and I also disagree with some of his other arguments, like ranking Roger Clemens as the best pitcher of all time. Interesting read for all baseball fans."
2,Too preachy,"The author, Allen Barra, is a stats geek. Which means he spends page after page (after page after page...) cherry-picking different formulas to prove that he is right and you are wrong. You think Mays was better than Mantle? NO, YOU'RE WRONG! You think Gibson was better than Marichal? SORRY, YOU ARE WRONG!! And so on and so forth.Why can't these guys ever just admit that they don't know the answer to the questions they pose? Just once I wish Barra would have said, ""To be honest, I have no idea who was better, Mays or Mantle."" Because the truth is, Allen Barra has no idea who was better, Mays or Mantle.Anyway, this has all been done before (better, if just as annoyingly) by Bill James. At least James has a sense of humor and a light touch around the typewriter. Barra comes off sounding like a nagging spouse."
1,A New York State of Mind,There is baseball outside of NYC but you'd never know it from this obnoxious one-sided book. Maybe if you love cute little Bob Costas you might like it...
5,Great deal,"This is an excellent dress shoe---very comfortable, goes well with business casual just as well as it goes with a suit. The shoe is very ""low profile,"" so it won't ruin the cut of your pants. Plus, the price is right given the quality."
1,Superficial Study of Gangs Shows Lack of in Depth Reseach and Few Inights,A reading of this book reveals nothing that is new and certainly no depth of understanding of gang culture except for the same tired cliches of other studies. There are much better books out there covering the same territory.
5,Good intro Bio for Bobby Darin - for fans or fans to be,"One of the two great Bobby Darin bios (the other being PBS's Beyond the Song). This one is totally different, and features more comments from friends and family than Beyond the Song which focuses more on interviews with fellow celebrities.I especially like the rare footage and photos of BD from his high school days, some as a drummer in a catskills band.And the high point is an interview with Atlantic engineer extraordinaire Tom Dowd, who give first hand testimony to the fact that BD worked hard for his success for years before he became an ""overnight"" sensation."
1,Sent the WRONG item,Totally useless for me as they sent me a power cord splitter that was labeled as a DVI to HDMI cable. I didn't even bother to open the bag and sent it back within seconds of receiving it. I would avoid this purchase!
5,Good cable at a great price,Ordered this cable to hook a laptop to a large external monitor to do photo editing. Cable works great and price was right. Would recommend this cable to anyone.
4,I think that the book showed me what it was like on the ship,"I think that the book was really good because it told about what it was like on board the ""Millionairs' Special."" The book also talked about some of the places such as the Grand Stair Case and how some of the passengers felt as the greatest ship in the world fell to the bottom of the ocean.Robert explained how he found the huge ocean liner."
5,I have always loved this book,"I have been a Titanic Lover for life. I first read this book when I was 6 (I am 14 now) it is a great book if you are looking to start studying the Titanic or if you just want to know the more basic facts about her and her finding. But if you are really deep into the studies of her already then I would get ""The Discovery of the Titanic"". but there are many, many other great books on her (I should know I have enough to start my own Titanic bookstore ;). For the beginning Titanic studier this is the best book you can buy."
5,Titanic,"Do you like old ships? Well, I know the right one for you. It is the Titanic. It is about a ship that hit an ice berg and went down. So go under water with Dr.Robert Ballard and explore the Titanic. Good Luck! This book is recommended for 8 and up."
1,"Old stuff , new paper quality","Read this over 25 yrs ago.The least they could'have done is adding a Full Titanic plan .Bought one myself when it was issued , and was offered one , by someone, who didn't know what I then knew!My advice , buy it for the kids , that is if they have any interest in the big ""T"" ( considering that this was first sold , then added to a Revell:Europe Package ,and that it comes on stream again , albeit with a new soft cover which makes it easely disposable !) , but please ! First look for the one you've forgotten about at the bottom end of you book case !Good yarn , though , if over priced!"
3,hellzapoppin,The dvd audio did not begin when the video started. Had to wait about 4 minutes then audio was OK. Delivery was as promised and in good condition.
1,"Funny, but not as funny as I remember","I saw this movie on television when I was about eight or nine years old. I watched it with my brother on New Year's Eve. At that time, we thought the movie was hysterical. I always had a great memory of that New Year's Eve, and this movie was part of that memory. However, after purchasing the movie and reviewing it 50 years later, it lacks the same hysteria of my youth. Granted there are some cleverly funny scenes, and the lack of continuity 50 years ago added to the hilarity. However, today, I understand the reason for the lack of continuity, and I can see that there is a bit too much filler to make this any type of movie of lasting quality. I'm glad I purchased it to try to relive a memory, but I really can't recommend the movie for someone who does not already have a nostalgia twinge associated with the film or the play. The low rating is no fault of Amazon or the vendor. The quality of the product is good. It's just that the content is outdated."
5,At Long Last,"I watched this movie as a kid in the 50's from an actual movie reel. After searching for years as an adult i finally found it on DVD and play often. I love the movies from the 40's and even more I love movies that make me laugh. The schtick is old but you can actually see where the Zucker Brothers got their ideas for Airplane. Martha Raye and her fabulous legs, Mischa Auer and his long legs, together they're wonderful. Entertaining, funny and now I know every line in the movie. I'll watch it forever."
3,Wild film weird comedy and great dancing!,"Helzapoppin is a wild mix of comedy music and dance in a ""We'll put on a Show!"" tradition. There is a segment where the ""Help"" at the home of very rich folks swing dance in the most energetic and enthusiastic way. If you a fan of ""Jitter Bugging"" this film is worth it for that part alone. Some of the personalities involve will be curiously familiar to old early Bugs Bunny cartoons where celebrities were worked into the plot."
5,My favorite Barbie... and I LOVE Barbie.,"This Barbie is splendid. She looks intelligent, cool, beautiful, graceful, and self-assured... her costuming is awesome, her braids are exquisite, and OMG her MAKEUP is fantastic and historically accurate. Moreover, the back of the box details her cosmetic routine, even explaining what the ancient Egyptians made their make up out of... a great way to introduce a kid to the ancient and magical ritual of cosmetics, as something beyond just being something that Mom and big sister might (or might not) do. I only have one little girl relative, and I got this for her- and made sure I got one for myself, too. If you get one of these for a young girl who is liable to wreck it, I recommend getting a spare one to give her when she is older, so she can appreciate the beauty of it. But I think one of these would be a good influence on a little girl- she has such cool makeup compared to most off-the-shelf Barbies, and her hair is beautiful."
5,works with Vista,"Took it out of my old XP computer, put it in my new Vista computer, it intalled automatically, and works fine."
3,Decent story of north vs s o uth,"Needs editing. Spelling , grammar, words missing.. usual love story. Desire, hate,sex, love triumphs. Some civil war history. Ok story"
3,One Wore Blue Review,"I really enjoyed the historical aspect of this novel and learning more about the Civil War. The personal conflict between the two main characters, other than when they were making love, got really tiresome and seemed less than authentic. I felt the same about the next book, One Wore Gray, as well. I wasn't interested in reading the third book in this series."
5,A keeper!,"If you've enjoyed other Heather Graham books and you have yet to read this one, it is a must! I went through every emotion reading this- anger, frustration, happiness, I even cried a couple of times! I wouldn't allow myself to start reading unless I was sure I wouldn't get interrupted, it was so annoying to have to stop! The first time I read this it came from my local library, within a month of reading it I went out and bought it for myself. Since then I have read it 4 times!!!!"
5,First of a trilogy,"Terrific book!! I read it a few years ago, but out of order, as I could find them. Now I've read the trilogy as it was meant to be read, and loved it. Ms. Graham either has a better memory of her history lessons, or spends a good deal of time on research. The stories are such that you may miss some sleep because you can't put them down."
2,Tried Something Out of My Comfort Era,"I went out of my comfort zone with this book. I tried to go to a differnt time and place because of the great reviews. I was so disappointed. The last 1/2 of the book was better than the beginning. I really had to tell myself to keep going since I have the other 2 in the series to read. Jesse was a good character, Kiernan was shallow. I thought the whole story was a little boring with out exciting love scenes. I am used to reading Bertrice Small (very much into sex scenes), Lynsay Sands (romance and humor) etc. I would not recommend this to a friend. It just didn't grab me..."
3,Pretty good,"This book was pretty good, but the main female character was a little annoying. It almost made me think Jesse deserved ""someone better"", someone who knew why he felt the way he did about fighting for the north. I still wanted to read the second book, and found it better than this one."
3,What are the publishers thinking?,"I read this series years ago. I would love to re-read it again. However, I am not going to pay $7.99 (full price) for a twenty year-old-book. I have a choice of where to spend my $$$. Apparently, Random House doesn't want my business. It is their loss (as well as the author)."
3,MORE OF A DETAILED HISTORY BOOK INSTEAD OF A GOOD STORY--,"I was quite surprised, as this book really wasn't very good. It droned on and on, more like a detailed history lesson than anything else with a bit of a story woven in to it. I had to wade past a lot of facts to get through it. From previous reviews I was expecting more. The story itself was too drawn out and the ending tended to ramble on while the main character Kiernan's ""I love you-I hate you"" routine really got old."
2,Try researching again and we'll see,"I could not finish this book. I hesitate in posting bad reviews because I'm an author too and I know that bad reviews hurt. The trouble is this novel's lead character is not at all an accurate reflection of her period. If you haven't spent your life researching the nineteenth century like I have, you wouldn't know better, and the novel would be quite enjoyable. Historical novels tend to be hit or miss for me based on capturing the voice of the period and my personal opinion of this novel is it's a miss."
4,Prompt - Great Condition,"This was listed as a ""used"" book. However, it was in great condition! Everything shipped promptly and packaged well."
2,Ok but not recommended. I wished it would be over and skimmed some parts.,"REVIEWER'S OPINION:There was too much civil war history. I'd prefer less history and more character interaction - for a romance novel. Sometimes there was too much time spent in the heads of the characters. For example, Jesse was thinking about all the political and slavery issues about to happen before the civil war. Jesse and Kiernan loved each other. She kept denying it to herself and claimed she hated him because he was on the side of the Yanks. Even though she loved Jesse, she married Anthony, and then cried afterwards. I didn't care for her judgment and actions.DATA:Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: eight. Setting: 1859 to 1861 Virginia. Copyright: 1991. Genre: historical romance, civil war.OTHER BOOKS:For a list of my reviews of other books by this author, see my 3.5 star review of ""Deadly Night"" posted under 3 stars 10/25/08."
1,ONE WORE BLUE,"I COULD NOT TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I ORDERED IT,I NEVER RECEIVED IT BECAUSE BOTH TIMES I ORDERED IT I GOT A MESSAGE SAYING IT WAS ORDERED,THEN I ALSO RECEIVED A MESSAGE THAT I WOULD BE RECEIVING A REFUND BECAUSE THE BOOK WAS NOT AVAILABLE,EVEN THOUGH WHEN I ORDERED IT,IT SAID IT WAS NEW PRINT. I AM VERY UPSET WITH: ""A1 BOOKS"" TO THE POINT WHERE I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN.THANKS,DARLENE"
4,Good game for mixed age players,"We bought this game for our 5 year old after agonzing between the adult and junior version. She thinks it is fun and we've used it a lot so far. Surprisingly (to us) the pieces aren't as easy to guide into the space a player intends, resulting in more of a level playing field than you might expect for this game...a plus for our family. The shapes are fun. The wooden pieces and side yellow bars seem very durable. We are a bit concerned about the long-term durability of the plastic windows as they don't seem very strong and have more give than we would like. We also have started playing with a towel or piece of cardboard under the game as the ""window"" is open on both sides and the wooden pieces could get beat up after hitting the table multiple times. Educational in a spatial development sense, but strategy is somewhat hard to apply for the reason of the pieces not often landing exactly as you might have expected. We're glad that we chose it."
5,Best I heard in a long time,The music on this album seems to show the true feelings of a person and the heartache that they have been through. I feel as if I can truly relate to this and the softness and the melody of this album are wonderfully calming.
4,Dancing in my Nightgown,The book is everything it was cracked up to be.This is a must read for anyone who has lost a loved one especially widows. It sure hits home. Five star reading
4,A book about life,No one can understand the sense of losing a loved one except those who have experienced it themselves. Betty Auchard uses this experience coupled with her vivacious personality to help all those who have experienced personal loss. After losing her husband of forty-nine years experience Betty suddenly finds she must continue on her own. Married at nineteen she never had to face some of the everyday experiences of life such as paying bills or pumping gas. Filled with humor and courage Betty shows that there is life after death and that she can still dance.
1,Worst assembly required I've ever experiened,"I found this to be impossible to assemble! Cannot even complete the 1st step of attaching the top to the legs! Cams and screws will not attach on ANY of the four legs. I have put together shelves, desks, chairs, etc. However, this is delicate to the point of being un-assemble-able! I cannot state this strongly enough: AVOID!"
4,Espresso = black,"I was kind of surprised at how dark...really black...this little table is. Assembly was completed by my pretty handy 14 year old son in about an hour. I really like the height of the table and the fact that it is solid wood. I consider this a good buy. Thanks, Amazon!"
2,If the drawer worked it might have met my expectations,"It looks nice, but the quality is poor. The pre-drilled holes don't line up perfectly which resulted in the drawer not opening smoothly. In fact you need to force it shut and pull hard to get it to open."
3,difficult to assemble,"This took so long to put together that I might as well have felled a tree, made my own lumber and built a table from scratch.It does look nice when finished."
5,Islands not for Kitchens anymore!,"Purchased this Kitchen Island but not for the kitchen. Needed something tall, good-looking and sturdy to put our tv on in the bedroom, which this is all the aforementioned. It allows for another bedroom piece to be placed underneath it that holds the cable box/dvr, dvd player, dvd's, etc. It's not pressed wood, but real wood and matches the bedroom furniture perfectly. The legs and chrome bars were the only pieces to assemble to the very sturdy frame and metal areas. It looks good and doesn't wobble or anything. It's nice, very nice indeed -- perfect!"
5,Beautiful and well-built cart,"I purchased this for use in the kitchen to hold a microwave. It comes in kit form and requires careful study of the instructions before assembly which took about an hour with some help from another person. The resulting cart is handsome and sturdy. The black, full-size microwave countertop oven that I purchased to go on top fits so well that most people think that the two, cart and the microwave, were purchased together and made for each other. The drawer works but is a little hard to pull out even after greasing the wood rails that it rides on. I won't use the drawer that much anyway."
3,Some Design Weaknesses,"The wood on the cart is attractive and the design is promising.I did have problems with cam locks in which you attach the legs to the table top. One cam lock refused to lock and another cam lock kept releasing its lock. Another cam lock was lost. I faxed Winsome and asked that they send me several more cam locks, however no response in a week. To rectify the problem of two loose joints, I screwed a wood screw through the top of the table into the table legs. My solution is not aesthetically pleasing, but it did rectify the problem of loose joints.I would recommend that Winsome re-engineer the joint between the table top and the table legs. The cam locks are troublesome. Otherwise, the rest of the assembly was fairly straightforward."
3,"Nice, but not perfect","I ordered two of these tables to set side by side. They are sturdy enough and the color is pretty, but they were not flush when arranged that way. I realize they weren't super expensive, but I still expected the tops to be even."
1,Poor quality,"I am still debating returning this item. The drawer on the bottom of this unit does not have rollers, just wood guides. The wood guides are not large enough for the drawer to fit into. Poor quality."
4,Reasonably nice for the price,"This is a relatively good looking table that was easy to assemble. It is not the greatest in terms of quality, but it is not terrible, and I think it is a good value for the price. The finish does come off somewhat easily, so handle with some care, or expect to buy furniture touch up."
4,Great product,"Great product. It's small enough to fit in my bedroom and also still useful at the same time. Wood is sturdy and there is quality to this product. Worth the money. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the instructions were confusing. Took a bit to figure out all the pieces. Otherwise, would buy again."
3,Not bad but not great,"I'm usually able to assemble items quickly and this unit took a while. The assembly pictures are misleading and none of the wood was marked. The silver guards between the top shelf and the drawer are ill fitting, as is the drawer - it takes two hands to open and close. Once assembled, it does look good - just don't try to lift or move it around by the top since it doesn't actually lock down as it should due to misaligned fittings."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,FOR ME THIS PRODUCT HAD AN ODD SMELL AND FLAVOR THAT MADE ME NAUSEOUS. IT REMINDED ME OF THAT NASTY SUPPOSEDLY APPLE CINNAMON FLAVORED THERAFLU LIQUID MEDICINE. THE GRASSY TASTE THAT OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS HAVE WOULD HAVE BEEN A WELCOMED CHANGE COMPARED TO THIS. AT LEAST IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NATURAL. THIS HAS A SWEET BUT VERY ARTIFICIAL AND UNNATURAL TASTE. I WAS ONLY ABLE TO USE IT ONCE AND HAD TO THROW THE REST AWAY. I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO RETURN OR EXCHANGE THE PRODUCT SO THAT WAS 30 BUCKS DOWN THE DRAIN. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.
4,very tasty,"has a good flavor, good with water or juice, mixes easily, nice ""green food "" smell. will buy again"
4,Nice 'Spin' on a Thirtysomething Career Woman,This book is great! I couldn't put it down and read it all in one sitting. It's the story of a British stand-up comedian named Rachel Katz. Rachel's foibles through life are as funny as her comedy bits and the novel will keep you interested and in stitches.
4,Funny,"This is a silly story about a talented female stand-up comic struggling to get by. She works for appropriately nasty employers, has appropriately quirky family and friends, and early on we meet her love interest who's pleasingly blue-collar with the brains to be white-collar. -- Perfect -- as you can see, the story was so predictable I could set my watch to it. But the jokes had me laughing and the characters were endearing...a great way to waste an afternoon!"
3,Light reading - really LIGHT reading!,"Sue Margolis' dipiction of standup comic Rachel Katz is entertaining, readable and humorous--however forced and predictable the plot may be. I found myself cringing at the overwhelmingly corny ending. Having said that, Spin Cycle is the perfect read for a lazy (really lazy) Sunday afternoon."
3,Cute but not great,"This book was cute, and a few parts did have me laughing out loud, even if some of the english slang was challenging to follow. I also agree with another reviewer's warning about some of the ""steamy"" sections - you may not want to be reading those on the train commuting home from work! Unfortunately many times it felt like Ms. Margolis was trying too hard (calling Matt her ""Rinse Charming""?!?! or ""I think you've found my Hotpoint"" UGH!! Enough of the washing machine gags!) That disappointed me and the ending seemed awfully pat, but it was an nice quick read. I'll still give Neurotica a try, but I would recommend ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" over ""Spincycle"" any day."
2,Boring...,I finally managed to finish this book... skipping over certain pages and accidentally rereading the same garbage in a bored stupor. I must agree with earlier reviewers when I say that the characters were flat and I found it impossible to care about anything they were doing. The jokes and one liners were horrible and most parts were just needlessly overdramatic and trite... Not a very entertaining or original novel at all... you're better off skipping over this one and taking a chance on another title.
2,I like romantic comedies but smut leaves me feeling dirty,I was very disappointed with this book. I like romantic comedies and expect there to be some sexy scenes but the detailed descriptions left me feeling like I needed a shower. I am not a prude by any means but I just don't care for books that leave nothing to the imagination. I will not read any other books by this particular author for fear of having to feel embarrassed about my reading material. Very disappointing. Just goes to show that Amazon does not always do a good job of matching a book to a person.
1,Stinkz,Very bad stinks like ben gay i threw it in the trash tomlyn products are usually perfect but this is a waste of money.
2,falls apart after warranty expires,"it's like this thing has a timer on it. When the warranty expires, it will literally fall apart. I say stay away from it. I'm kidding, it totally rules. You should buy it."
4,Excellent entry level camera,"I love the camera but it seems difficult to find some accessories which I had come to rely on with my old camera. I may just have to upgrade to another Canon SLR.I bought the Rebel 2000 over a year and a half ago. My previous camera was a twenty-year-old Canon AE-1. I was very happy with the AE-1 but was having trouble seeing to focus in low-light situations. So far the Rebel 2000 has been a great camera - I think I've used every feature at least once. I added a 100 mm portrait lens.My only dissatifaction is that I haven't been able to find a remote or off-camera shutter release that works. I was sold a Canon Remote Control RC1 which did not work. I like to use an off-camera shutter trigger of some kind in portrait and low-light conditions to minimize camera shake. I also can't find the cable to connect the hot shoe to my studio lights.On the whole, I am happy with the Canon Rebel 2000."
3,Realize what entry level means...,"Being an entry level SRL, the camera body is cheap & light because it is made out of plastic. This more than fine for someone who'd like an SRL to use for specal occasions - kids'birthdays, graduations, or the occasional family road trip.But if you're a serious photogapher, who plans doing much heavier photography and / or traveling, let me suggest you look for a sturdier camera, since my experience with this camera wasn't very good. The body was very easily scratched, and basically burned out less than 2 years after I bought it.So if you're a photo enthuseist looking for a good camera - please consider the fact that this camera wears out quickly (partly because of the plastic), and sooner of later you may be looking for a sturdier body."
5,Quick Delivery and Great Condition,"They did not lie when they said ""Like New"". There was only a slight amount of cosmetic wear on the grip, which is to be expected, but other than that the camera is mint. Not only did I get the camera for a very reasonable price, it came with batteries included. As it turns out, though, whoever packaged the camera left it on and the batteries were almost dead when I got it. It's the thought that counts, though. I really appreciate the fast delivery, 4 days, and the quality of this camera. 5 out of 5."
4,Great gift,"Purchased for someone else, still cold outside so they've not used it, but recognized it to be of good quality compared to others they've seen."
4,ugly sunday afternoon,"mark lanegan's first solo album with the yet unknown artist kurdt cobain under his wing, singing backing vocals and guitar on a couple of tracks but this is not about kurdt this is about mark lanegan and his brilliant first solo album only surpress by the beautiful sombre ""bubblegum"" that was released in 2004 to rave reviewsthis album has all the trademarks of an artist finding his feet and giving a middle finger to anyone who doesn't care,this album features the classic cover which nirvana would remarkably cover nearly 5 years later yes you know what i'm talking about the classic blues/artist leadbelly huddie leadbetter aka leadbelly ""where did you sleep last night"" i'm not saying i hate the nirvana version but mark's voice sorts it betterwell the cover out the way there's more classicsmusuem mockingbirds ugly sunday, eyes of a child, WOE,and juarezmark lanegan the gravely voiced genius puts a notch on his belt..A FANTASTIC DEBUT AND CLASSIC country/grunge"
2,Not for me,"Like the other solo records, I tried and tried to get through it with something that really grabbed me. Not so much."
4,"You cant kill whats already dead, but i wont blame you for trying","The Winding Sheet is Lanegans first effort to give himself to his folk influences , to become a respected songwritter and an individual musician without the other ""trees"" this Lanegans solo album is quite different to his previous work with his Seattle Grunge emblematic band Screaming Trees , its depressive, melancholic, intense, troubled and beautifull, this album opens with ""mocking birds"" and a sad but appealing at the same time environment sorrounds the space, cuts like ""juarez"" are kinda funny in the middle of the grey atmosphere,""loveyou little girl"" is another nice short track, ""where did you sleep last night"" were recorded in the days were Kurt Cobain still were in this world and you can hear his voice in the backing vocals as well Novoselic bass, later Nirvana did their own version of this song a good one too, The Winding Sheetmay be the darkest album in Lanegans discography but is one of the most appealing.HM"
4,A floating death-trap...,"From the back cover:A floating death-trap...They called it the Mary Deare, ""a floating piece of ironmongery off the junk heap"". For forty years she had tramped the seas, suffered shipwreck twice and been torpedoed three times in two world wars. One March, battered and bruised, she came out of the Biscay gales into the Channel...."
2,Good but not what I though,I thought this was going to give me a couple of things history put on paper a little an entirely different way. Lots of just black and whit on a page with some inked pages of drawings. I had a coule other books to try to get me to the cutting edge stuff which is what I was needing at the time and it still sits on my shelf opened one time...look into its contents before buying I thought a different outcome from the title.
5,The Miami feel...,"What I love about Ivano's music...it isn't commercial [...]. This is an unique musician that turns music into art. This is not the type of thing you'll find in a massive buy ot shelf; if those are Mercedes Benz, this is a Ferrari.I'd say this music is sexy, dark and funky. It is very difficult to find Ivano's touch in other artist or Dj. However, this CD is quite different from the last one, because just as Ivano states, in this production he has abandoned the turntables and has used professional software to give like a studio feel.Thumbs up!"
4,Shelf Cube,"Easy to assemble. Looks pretty good when finished, but I will need to paint the back to make it 100%."
3,Smaller than I thought,"This was a nice product, but smaller than I thought. I was hoping to use it for a bookshelf, but it isn't large enough to do that. It arrived in good condition, and in a timely manner."
4,"Decent Shelf, but it's Plywood","It was easy to put together and it's a nice little shelf for under a desk, but the plywood has already split in the back of the shelf so I know it won't last long term, but for the price it fills the job I need it for at the moment. For DVDs, BluRays it works nicely, but the DVDs and BluRays don't fit standing up which was a bummer."
3,"It looks nice, but it's not perfect","I was looking for a small storage case to use in my bedroom and settled on this. The reviews seemed good, so I bought it. After assembling it (fairly easy) I was struck by how the middle shelf doesn't have much support. I was planning on using it for books, so I had to send it back. In summation, if you don't need to store lots of things on this I'm sure it would be great. But if you do plan on keeping anything heavier than some books, you might want to try and find a more sturdy alternative."
3,Small,Doesn't hold much. I can't even put puzzles on it. Works as a shallow bookshelf. Easy to put together. Word.
3,Product is fine but watch out for SHARP EDGES,"I like this product fine, as it was a great deal and serves its purpose in our home. It had VERY sharp edges, which made me nervous with our young children, so we keep it in closets out of their way. We've used it to store diapers/wipes/diaper cream, which it was the perfect size for, and now we use it in our older girls' room to stack their shoes on. It is smaller than I originally expected, certainly wouldn't hold any books or anything larger like that, but it works great for storing smaller items."
1,good concept,"If the middle shelf isn't in there, you can put a normal size book or something in it. however, the shelf makes it impossible to fit a small book in the cube. Also, the cube itself is made of cheap materials that can't support much weight. So unless you are storing small files that aren't too full, this s a waste of time. Not to mention the price is way more than it should be for something of this nature."
4,Simply too BIG!,"This bag is HUGE. It has great storage features and is well built, but if you put all of the tools it could fit in it, you would need a caddy! Wait, I think a set of golf clubs would be lighter. The center compartment can easily fit a large cordless drill in its factory case. If you are looking for a bag to just organize and carry small hand tools, you might be better off with the Veto Pro-Pac. This bag is better as a carry all though, as you could carry a powertool or large socket set in the center compartment"
4,Easy to haul everything,"Only problem with this bag, a little bit big so to fill it up you need to buy more light weight tools, or get a stronger back. My brotherr has filled it with everything to work on vehicals and a house at remote beach location. It keeps them all at hand, clean orginized and out of others hands! Now I just need to get another couple of them"
2,"I returned it, no rubber bottom","The picture has a heavy duty rubber molded bottom on the bag, The model I recieved was missing this and had a black cordura bottom/base. I wanted what was in the picture. Also too expensive. A similar version at Home Depot for 50.00 will work if I cant get the molded rubber bottom version."
3,Interesting but not what I was looking for,This DVD was interesting but I expected something a little more focused on the workings of the brain. The topics covered are case studies of abnormal brain activity.
2,Disappointed,"This movie gives a vague description of what the mind can do and how it works. Following a story lines based on military tactics, sexual attractions and why some people like to kill and have no remorse. Their are some good theories, but how they translate the information is for the unintelligent, sorry I give this film two thumbs down. It seems to me that the History Channel dumbs down a lot of their documentaries for the dumb people who write in and complain how they can't grasp the information."
2,Not for classroom use,"I bought this hoping to use it in teaching psychology, but no luck. The scenes about sex would be too embarrassing, and the dvd tries to make a case that ESP is real. The History Channel should stick to history."
3,not for teachers,"I am a high school teacher and am always looking for DVDs on how the brain works, even though I teach history. This had good scientific information but has one segment on the difference between men and women in brain activity during sex. I would never have purchased this, had I known."
2,will anyone ever take Angie seriously?,"Angie and her family always spend their summer holidays at Potter's Lodge. But Angie soon receives a letter from a friend who goes to the baton-twirling club with Angie back at home. Since Angie is the treasurer of the club, she has to take the cash-box with her on vacation.But Angie ends up 'borrowing' some money and feels guilty. She needs to return the money to the cash-box before her holiday ends...before anyone from her club finds out what she did. So Angie plans to earn her money at Potter's Lodge, without letting anyone know. But however hard Angie tries, no-one will give her what she wants...money. Find out how she earns it. However, I found this book quite boring. it wouldn't be for people above 7-9."
3,It's ahh-right,"This CD has a few good songs on it, I really enjoyed #7 by R. Jones, the message and the music just really touched my spirit. I'd like to hear more from this artist. Good job Play, had no idea you were still out there, let alone bringing it to us in the name of the lord. Keep up the ministry."
1,Boring,"I was anticipating a joyful reading experience but instead was so bored and frustrated in reading the first chapter that I put the book in the ""must not open again"" book pile.I have no patience or time to waste with academia of this type. I'll be looking for a more pleasant reading experience about Holland in another book and I hope I won't be this disappointed again."
1,Silence and Cry,"This,Silence and Cry, has got to be one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. I watched the whole thing asking myself, ""So, what's the point? What's the point? Where is this movie going?"" And at the end of the movie, I was still asking myself, ""What was the point?""Only after I read the editorial review on Amazon.com, which provided the necessary background to understand the movie, did it make sense. Unfortunately, the movie provided none of that background. A good movie would have."
3,What happened to good Sebadoh?,"Evidently Sebadoh couldn't top the classic Bubble and Scrape or Eric played a more vital role in Sebadoh than Lou and Jason would like to admit. Though the album still sounds like Sebadoh, it is missing that experimental edge that made the preceding albums so interesting. There lacks variance between the sounds of the tunes. Harmacy comes off as a band trying to sound like Sebadoh but failing to pull it off. Sounds like Lou might be succumbing to the pressure to be an alternative radio hit machine."
3,I'm not a good friend,"This is probably Lou Barlow's finest hour. I'm not familiar with any of his work with Folk Implosion but I would assume that this album surpasses it. Saying that this album is his masterpiece isn't necessarily saying a lot. Sebadoh were always trying to be the best band in the world but they never quite got there. They were constantly shy of being great. That being said this is still a really good record. Although, it is not an all-time classic by any means. ""Not a friend"" is an excellent song and probably one of Lou's best. The other songs aren't quite as excellent but there is some good tunage to be found. Highlights are: Magnet's Coil, Skull, Rebound, S. Soup, Together or Alone."
2,This is a great album...,"...if you are a cheesey college student alterna-rocker wannabe than this album is for you. If you are a loyal and dedicated Sebadoh fan then you will find nothing interesting on this album. Eric Gaffney is gone, and so is the sound that made me a Sebadoh fan. This is a bunch of guys on the verge of selling out big-time. Although, i must say ""Magnets Coil"" rocks!!! and so does ""Dramamine"". But after that, you just kinda gotta search around the disc for the good songs. Everything else is pure boredom."
4,Many rewards await the discerning reader,"SMOKING POPPY is a daedal novel, and the Booklist précis is all the plot summary a reader requires to 'take a whiff'. What that review does not share is how Graham Joyce has managed to update a familiar tale (Conrad's HEART of DARKNESS) and, in the process, completely and ravishingly made it his own.The plot, the graceful (writerly) style, the characters - each a 'person in full', although Dan Innes, the novel's core protagonist, really shines. Moreover, there is the novel's sub-text: Graham Joyce has important insights to share about our relationships with each other -- parent:child(ren), child:parent, friend:friend, lover:lover, etc. And that is not the end of the treasure trove Joyce has gifted us; many rewards await the discerning reader.SMOKING POPPY has so much to say and says it so well. Recommended."
5,In the Realm of the Spirits,"Graham Joyce is a great author...dear lovers of wonderful fiction,... whose characters come alive. In this novel, Daniel is a father who cannot understand how he has become so estranged from his son Phil, who's become a fundamentalist Christian, and more particularly, his beloved daughter Charlie, about whom he receives news that she is languishing in a Thai prison for smuggling dope. This leads him on an adventure to the heart of poppy country, and into the world were the spirits reside beside us, and must be dealt with, and not ignored as they so often are in the modern world.Somehow Joyce makes the world of spirit belief come alive without ever violating the modern scientific point of view. He leaves the reader to decide what is true. He is a real master.kyela,the silver elves"
4,Great Book - Read It,"I couldn't put this one down and read the entire book on one long day of traveling cross country. The book is about a lot of things. Love for the game of baseball, if not the business of baseball. What kind of crooked nonsense goes on in thousands of small towns across the US every day with bogus politicians defying the will of the people they are supposedly there to serve. How companies that screw all of us somehow convince people and politicians that they are looking out for our best interests. But most of all, this book is about the absolute need all American citizens have for a free press, and a free press that is intelligent, well-informed, willing to take risks, and willing to do its damm job. When the press rolls over, there really is no hope of outing the kinds of crooks and morons Bouton smokes out. It's a very compelling read and I comend Bouton for writing it (even if his originally publisher wimped out)."
5,Saving a Ballpark,"More than 30 year ago in the highly acclaimed ""Ball Four"" Jim Bouton took us inside Major League Baseball and was banned from the sport for years for saying it as he saw it. Now, in 2003 he takes us inside again...this time the politicians of Pittsfield, Mass and his desire to purchase an old ballpark (Wahconah Park) and make it a truly public team...of the people, by the people and for the people...but the politicians thought otherwise. It's a fabulous read an a true commentary on politics and sports."
5,just way I needed,works great for a big Foreman indoor/outdoor grill and stand I have from years ago.
3,Okay For An All-In-One-Bag Costume,"The quality of the skirt and shirt are just okay. Looks like the skirt was stitched together in five minutes, but no one will see the seams anyway because the shirt covers that up. I don't agree with the sizing on the package. This costume is supposed to fit women sized 6-12. Well, I'm a size 6 and the skirt is a little smug on me. So if you are a size 10-12, I would recommend you size up, unless you want a skin-tight costume. The glasses that come with it are not what is shown in the picture; they are plastic sunglasses and look more like what Velma really wore, so I was happy about that. The quality of the wig is great! It looks better than any other cheap Halloween wig I've seen. Overall, I'm satisfied with this costume, but if you're looking for something of very high quality, this is not for you. Would be great for a night of Trick-Or-Treating or for a casual costume party like I will be attending."
2,Yellow,"This book was yellow and moldy. When it said ""new"" I didn't think it sat in someone's attic for years."
5,I use this all the time,"After helping a friend wire his 6 room addition, I was tired of climbing up and down ladders because I left one of my wiring tools or supplies at the last place I worked. With several of my own projects on the horizon, I bought this to hold just my household wiring tools, and it works perfectly.Now I can find my tools and have them at my side, which saves me countless trips up and down the ladder.The main bag has pockets to hold two strippers and one large lineman's pliers. The ends have room for a needle nose, a side cutter, and 3 (maybe 4) screwdrivers. The large pouches organize my electrical tape, wires nuts, strain reliefs, and romax staples. The larger pouches are even big enough to hold a tape measure, receptacles, switches, and even a box or maybe two.Everything I use all the time for household wiring is right where I want it. And when I need it, I know exactly where I left it."
3,bucket boss tool pouch...,The item appears to be quite sturdy and should be a handy carrier for tools for household jobs.
4,Classic,"Does what it's designed to do. Great knife for a Cub Scout/ Boy Scout. My son loves it. I just wish the blade could lock out, but hey, it's what I learned on"
5,"Work passionately, live passionately!","Nancy Anderson doesn't just show you how to find a career you're passionate about she shows you how to find a life you're passionate about!As I worked my way through my autobiography, and the other enlightening excercises in the book, I watched the hardened exterior of my old life crack and fall away, exposing the shine of a new life as bright as freshly polished silver.I recommend this book to anyone who is tired of being and working the way others think they ""should"" and to those who are tired of making excuses for not doing the work they love and living the life they deserve.Life is precious, live it now. This book will show you how."
4,A great HOW TO book,"Long on useful and sensible techniques for transforming your current job situation into one that stirs your soul. A little short on the WHY of changing your life and situation, but a perfect handbook for those who have accepted the need for change and are looking for excellent guidance only their path to a new and better career."
2,questionable,"The table itself looks just as advertised and was in good condition, however, all of the hardware for attaching the legs to the table was completely rusted upon arrival. even the screws holding the brackets to the table were rusted as well."
3,Not long enough,"The three stars are for looks, price, and how sturdy this unit is. It is very easily put together as well. The only thing about this table are the dimensions seem to be off a little bit. This table doesn't quite measure up to coffee table size. It is rather short and is not long enough."
5,Withstands Small Children,"I've had this table for a while now, and I'm glad I got it. It looks elegant, and has survived so far, from my son. He's pushing and pulling things and this 'thing' has not even shown the slightest sign of wear."
4,Nice Table for the Money,"Although the first table arrived with some surface imperfections, Amazon quickly made good on a no-charge replacement, and a refund of my return shipping charges. The replacement is a nice, clean looking piece of furniture. I don't know how it will hold up but I'm very satisfied right now."
1,JUNK,"It's wood but not a solid piece of wood the table is made from 2"" x 2"" strips that are glued and pressed together and when the install the bottom piece with the metal accents they tightened the screw way to much and split the table straight down the middle. There's no phone number for this company but have sent them an email it's has been 3 days and they HAVE NOT responded !!!!!!!!!!!! This the first thing I have ever boughten off Amazon and the last because of my experience with this purchase."
1,Central Saint Martins wants you to go to college. . .,"preferably theirs. This book reveals very little about fashion design or the buisness. It is full of a lot of general information much like you would find in one of those late night tv, or print ads, telling you that you may have what it takes to ""become a serious artist."" Because of course then you are interested and will pay them money. This book works in much the same way. It is a teaser published by Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. Now had they given me this book, say. . . at my orientation, i probably would have appreciated it. However I was rather disappointed when I realized that I had just paid $30 at SFMOMA for an advertisement from CSM."
2,I was disappointed - not enough exercises to really practice,"I find that to learn a language, I need to to do more than repeat. I need to listen and respond. These tapes have a lot of material to repeat, but spend only a little time on exercises requiring responses."
4,Great Overview - Easy Grand Canyon Day-Hikes,This small booklet provides a wonderful overview of the best easy day-hikes in the Grand Canyon. It's easy to browse the book and develop a vacation plan for taking some of the day-hikes. The author identifies a few day-hikes that offer some of the more spectacular canyon overlooks. A worthy investment.
3,"A good guide, but not up-to-date.","Our family found this to be a good guide to Grand Canyon trails during our visit in August, 2000. The descriptions of the Bright Angel trail and South Kaibab trail were accurate. However, the Rim trail, which is described in detail in the book, seems to no longer exist. I don't know who's at fault. The NPS does a terrible job of marking its Grand Canyon trails. Don't assume that every trail described in the book will be there. Check with an NPS employee first."
4,"Good Book, Needs Updating","This is an excellent guide to the different day hikes available in the park. The book has some organizational problems, and day hikers should beware that no hike below the rim can be categorized as ""easy"" despite what it says in the front of the book. Some of the information is now dated, including road names, when shuttles run, and the location of the main visitor center. The Rim Trail does indeed exist and the description in the book is accurate, although the trail has now been extended to Pipe Creek Vista and does not end at Yavapai Observation Station as the book states. For ideas about what to do at Grand Canyon in terms of day hiking, this book is hard to beat."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,THIS BOOK WHICH I EXPECTED TO BE A BIOGRAPHY TURNED OUT TO BE SOME PLAY THAT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MY TIME. ALL I CAN SAY IS DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS BOOK. IT'S A SHAME THERE IS NOT A ZERO STAR RATING!
4,Good enough...,Great program but the fact that you can't lock the toolbar into place leads to major amounts of time wasted. Homesite kind of peaked at version 3 when it was run by Alaire.
1,Not for the beginner.,"I am unfamiliar with 4.5 but, to an extent, I can support the comments from the user from New Jersey. I was chosen by a nonprofit corporation to maintain their website. Macromedia support is nonexistent. The user forums are of no help to someone new to website design and maintenance. (The response to request I have made for assistance, has been a rote, cryptic referral to the user forum.) The manual provided by Macromedia is almost completely useless. If you already know HTML code well, your experince may be different. Following the suggestion from the NJ reviewer, I am picking up a used copy of Homesite 4.5 for Dummies and keeping my fingers crossed."
2,Poor customer support,"I'm holding on the phone right now trying to get support for this product. There is no 800 number for tech-support, so it's a long distance call. I have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person. They offer only email support, but don't write back. If you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you, but it never happens."
3,"Useful, but lack of support a problem","I must echo prior comments about poor support. I once submitted a question and the untimely response did not address my question. It was as if a harried support person whipped out an answer without really reading what I'd written.HomeSite is still a very useful product for those who want to hand code. I would still be using it if it weren't for TopStyle Pro 3.10. TopStyle was created by the original author of HomeSite, Nick Bradbury. Though it is intended primarily for stylesheets, it serves my purposes just as well. (I'm not a pro, so there may be additional features in HomeSite that I don't miss in TopStyle). Moreover, Nick Bradbury and a cadre of volunteers provide excellent support. Take a look at bradsoft.com."
2,What a freak - I have to leave the sound muted,"OK, I got this because there aren't a lot of videos that are doing by men or for men. I thought this would be more comfortable than something obviously marketed to women.I was wrong.While I have nothing against, Tai Chi for the exercise value, I am not into waving my arms around to usher ""waves of self love and acceptance"" over me. What a pile! Come on! Really?I think the audience would be better served without the psuedo-spiritual dung pile that accompanies any actual physical exerice. Besides working out my gut from laughter, I just don't see the benefit.Bottom line: the guy is a fruit. So if that's your thing, enjoy. Otherwise, steer clear...."
5,Excellent!,"This is a very good Table-Top Router Table. It has 2 different aluminum tracks on the table top and one aluminum track on the fence for attachments (featherboard, etc...). The table is made of 12 ply plywood. Along with a fully height adjustable router plate and plate holes for the most common routers (and a template to add the more obscure ones), this router was up and running in less than an hour, making red oak trim like the pros. Rubber feet round out an excellent addition to my tool inventory."
3,"Great table, but poor packaging/assembly parts","The router table works great by all means. The only complaint I have is that I had to drill my own holes for the assembly parts because some of the pieces didn't line up. I emailed the manufacturer about it too, never got a response.Also once I attached the router to the router plate, the screws provided stripped. I would recommend using your own screws for attaching your router to the plate."
4,Nice Buy,"If it wasn't for the outrageous price, this would get 5 stars. The router table was missing a part, but Bench Dog shipped it promptly. Overall, compared to what else is out there, it is a good buy."
4,"Great design, quality hinges/precision, 2 cheezy parts","This is a good, solid router table if you want something portable. Packaging is well-designed, everything arrives intact, construction is very straight forward. The design is clean and well thought out.This table's worked well for me, but I have had a couple of (easily fixable) problems with it. The handles for clamping the fence down have split on me, with the metal threads coming away from the plastic handles. A little epoxy fixed that problem, but for $200 for a portable table, I expect more.This is a good solid purchase; I'd make it again. I would recommend putting some formica on the face of the raw MDF fence face to smooth out the motion a little bit. Enjoy."
3,"Long wait, good product","I originally ordered this item on June 19, 2004. Despite being listed as shipping in 1-2 days, it arrived over one month from my order date.Since it arrived, I've used it for several projects. I've been very happy with the results. It's not too heavy to move around, but is beefy enough to run a large bit without any noticeable vibration. I've been able to get very clean edges on rail & stile doors and rounding edges.One thing to be aware of is that the router insert plate does not accept rings or templets, and can't be used with larger bits. Combine that with the fact that the router insert plate is smaller than the ""standard"" plate size, and you'll find that the insert plate is the only weak point in this otherwise great router table."
4,Bench Doc ProTop Router Table,"The router table arrived today so of course I had to assemble it right away. The instructions in the box were for an altogether different Bench Dog product:( It wasn't too hard to figure out how to put it together, BUT...there were 3 holes that weren't machined properly. The cross dowel holes were in the right place, but the through holes were WAY off. I will have to drill them out later. Lastly, there were ""extra"" of some of the parts and two missing bolts (the 5/8"" 1/4-20's). Luckily I was able to cut down the ""extra"" 1/4-20 1-3/4"" bolt and the 1/4-20 1-1/4"" bolt. Of course after the fact I found the instructions on the Benchdog.com website.All in all, for the price it's a nice little router table. 4 stars because of the missing directions and bolts."
5,A Great Value,"This is a well made and very sturdy bench top router table. Assembly is straight forward, with very clear directions. My table came with a stiffer and heavier phenolic insert, rather than the acrylic insert advertised. The fence is well designed and very nicely made. Overall, you can't beat the value. Though this isn't a criticism, there are two areas for improvement: 1) it should ship with a switch assembly to turn the router on/off, and 2) it should also ship with a pair of feather boards. Bench Dog sells a pair for [$$]- highly recommended as they work perfectly with this table."
4,Bench Dog router table,"Assembly was straight-forward. Directions well written. Only negative was power switch was extra and had to be installed seperately. Working very well. Table and Porter-Cable router make a great combo. Quiet, smooth, and powerful. Great product for part-time user or contractor."
5,Excellent but assembly times vary,"The end product is quite convincing and sturdy. The table is very solid with my Bosch 2.25 hp router mounted, and it is light enough to easily stow when not in use. The levelling screws tend to vibrate loose, so I check and tighten each time I use it.This table took me four hours to assemble. There are over 150 components that must be assembled. Sort all the hardware first. That helps but it still takes awhile. I was short one required nut which I bought at my hardware store for $.31.Although there are some uber-assemblers out there who will throw this together in an hour, I think this is a substantial project for the average hobby woodworker; however, the steps are clear and the components fit together beatifully.Overall this seems like a good product at a good price. I do wish Bench Dog would be as precise in putting together their hardware bags as they are in cutting the pieces though."
4,well worth the price,"would have been 5 stars if had been somewhat less expensive, but is sturdy. Only a few negatives: the description said it had a 4"" opening for dust collector. It is 2 1/2"" so ended up with buying an unnecessary adaptor to my 2 1/2 system. The dust collector vent is on top so shavings falling down into the table build up and must be manually removed. Yes, this may be petty, but I thought the purpose of a dust collector was to get nearly all the shavings. Lastly, I wish that the router plate had a hole for the adjusting key for my Porter-Cable.router. I would rather not start drilling out holes which might mess up another router configuration. In the best of all possible worlds, it would be nice if the router manufacturers would agree on a standard mounting configuration."
2,disappointed,"I was really hoping that all the reviews about the Bench Dog table were true. I was incredibly disappointed that one of the wooden case pieces was drilled incorrectly. I expect that for a $300 router table (which is twice the cost of my Porter Cable router) should not have such a major manufacturing flaw. I called Bench Dog and they will send me a new part, but now I will have to go about a week without a working table. This is totally throwing off my project schedule. Buyers beware that Bench Dog admits that this problem in manufacturing occurs from time to time."
2,Better Choices out there,"After having used this table for a month, I am very disapointed with its short comings. 1- this table is very heavy. 2- It does not offer any means of measurement. Most over the counter (Sears, etc.) at least offer some means of indexing or reference ruler. 3- This table is only good for making cigar boxes. Bigger routing projects take a lots of immagination on this table. 4- This tble should only be about $80. And that's for the decent extrusions on this table.I have given up on this. I am going to make my own table. I will probably use Jointech indexed fence."
4,Very happy with this table,"I've had this a few months and I've used it for a number of projects and I have no major complaints. I have a Freud FT3000VCE Router mounted in it and after I figured out how to mount it, it's all good. I had to drill some new holes in the plastic adapter, but it wasn't hard and only took a few minutes. It took a while to put the table together, but the craftsmanship is good and it is very solid. The only complaint I have is that I had to drill holes to mount my router. That is not really a ding against the table I guess - maybe more of a complaint against the router for not using standard holes. I'm not a professional obviously, but I do think this is a good product and I'd buy it again."
4,A Book full of evil powers,This book had some of the most evil powers i have every seen. I hope that the other two books have the same stuff in them but for different clans. I wish it would have given a little more background for the clans in the vooks though.
1,no click sound,"The pump works fine, but the click sound just worked on the first two bottles. I send an e mail to vacu vin, they answered pretty fast telling me that I shouldnt worry, as long as it pumped out the air. But the thing is that the click sound doesnt works, get a pump that doesnt costs 5 dls more for a ""click"" sound."
1,The older model is more reliable.,"Mine worked for a while, but then seemed to start to stick, which made it impossible to pump anymore. I tried soaking the entire mechanism several times in soap and water, but it still doesn't work. I initally liked the clicking feature and sleeker design of this model, but have gone back to using the old version, since this one stopped working."
2,Failed after 100,"The Concerto worked well for about the first 50 bottles then seized up. Required a little cooking oil to free it up. Then after 100 bottles, pieces of the pump fell out the bottom. Good concept, poor reliability."
1,Great concept - but low quality - will jam permanently,"I wish another company would make the same product with better quality. Although the concept is spot on, there's a problem with the rubber o-ring inside the pump - it will slide out of place and jam up the pump so that it becomes unusable. My first one lasted about 9 months before that happened, so I was willing to try again. The second one, however, lasted less than a month before the o-ring slipped and the pump jammed. There is no way to open it up to fix it. So until they fix this problem, this product is hit or miss. Caveat emptor!"
5,WINE THIS!,"The question that has perplexed man for centuries, ""Do you let her stay all night or call a cab for her?"" It's the same with left over wine. If you try and drink it in the morning you'll find that it doesn't taste as good as it did last night! These is nothing you can do with a half a bottle of oxidized wine except throw it out or settle for vinegar. If you want that wine to taste good in the morning, buy yourself a Vacu Vin Concerto Wine Saver. It will keep your opened bottles of wine fresh for days. If you called the cab, you won't have to share the wine. If you let her stay, the next time she leaves will be with half your stuff! The Vacu Win Concerto Wine Saver will save you a lot of money!"
4,Simplicity at its best,"This product delivered on its promise. No involved gadgetry, just a simple fix. I later noticed this product selling in stores where good wine is appreciated. This is a good gift for wine enthusiasts or those who drink infrequently. My holiday shopping just got a little easier!"
4,Satisfied,Works well. This is my first vacuum stopper set so no history to compare it to. Pump seems sturdy and good value for the price.
1,Just doesn't work,"This product, and those like it, simply don't work. This has been confirmed both by scientific measurement (they don't come anywhere near to removing all the oxygen), and by blind taste testing. (For a more detailed criticism, see the article ""A Giant Sucking Sound--And That's All"" on the winespectator web site)."
1,Rendered unusable after 1 year!,"Worked great for 10 months or so, and then bam....stuck! Cannot use it unless you run water or oil through it. Also, questioning whether these vacuum suckers work at all."
2,Vacu Vin Concerto Wine Saver,"I replaced my older model with this new one because of the new feature - a clicking sound to tell me when I can stop pumping. Well, I did not hear any clicking sound."
1,Bought 3 of these over 2 months...all non-functional!!!!,"Well understand I am a BIG fan of Vacu Vin prodcuts..but they lost the formula on this one. I have had 3 of these Concertos and ALL of them have had the pump arm freeze (lock up with no movement in both directions) within 2 weeks of owning them. When they worked they did the job and the new ""click"" feature seemed to be a real winner.... But needless to say the design is a real junker and needs major re-design. I would use the standard Vacu Vin device in lieu of this new ""Bomb"". I am a wine maker and sware by the vacu vin process despite this bad design."
5,Keeps wine fresh.,"I'm a pretty big fan of Pinot Noir, which tends to start tasting bad very quickly if left out. Keeping it in the refrigerator would often allow me to drink a bottle over 2, maybe 3 days tops before Vacu Vin. After that it was just too sour.Since I've purchased this I've been able to keep the wine fresh for a week with little or no perceptible loss of taste. The combination of vacuum and refrigeration allows me to enjoy a glass or two every day, without having to drink a half bottle for fear of wasting it.Given that the bottles of wine I purchase generally cost around $30 the Vacu Vin Concerto is well worth the small investment. It's saved enough wine to pay for its cost 10 times over in the short time I've been using it. It is small and easy to use. My only desire would be for them to include more stoppers, but you can buy those seperately for not much money."
1,Sorry to debunk...,"It has been proven to not work. If anyone should know about this subject, it's the Wine Spectator. So look at their article from December 15th, 1994! It's called ""A Giant Sucking Sound: And That's All."" It shows that these wine-saver vacuums simply do not work.Save your money. Stick in the cork and leave it at that!"
1,jammed after 1 1/2 bottles,"The wine was ok, but it jammed up pretty quickly. Totally worthless product."
5,A+++ ITEM!,I bought this exact item locally at Le Gourmet Chef. I love this gadget! No more flat wine. You can buy addittional stoppers at a low price & it's so easy to use. Planning on buying one of these for my father in law who loves wine also. If you're like me and only like to drink a glass of wine at a time then this is a definite must have! You won't be dissappointed! ;o)
4,"Oh no, the price went up!","I paid only $8.98 for a new Wine Saver set, not $20. But it's still an incredibly useful gadget. Simply insert one of the (included) rubber stoppers in the bottle, and pump the air out. When you hear the musical click, it's all done! It extends the life of your wine several days. We had a bottle of merlot last an extra four or five days using the Vacu Vin. And it's so small, you can take it along with you to your favorite BYO restaurant, seal up the rest of the bottle, and take it home safely! An extremely useful gadget, and great tool for your aspiring wine snob friends. Get a couple extra stoppers to extend the usefulness."
5,Works great,"This caster and leveling system works great. Its easy to operate and easy to install on your Bench Dog router table cabinet. My only complaint is that its a bit pricey, and I think my Bench Dog cabinet should have come with them (It was pricey too)."
3,"Good product, requires some tweaking",I Like this product but have to occasionally adjust the nuts on the locking legs to allow them proper clearance
3,Needs more padding,"The straps work as advertised, but the padding on them is thin to the point of why bother. But, it does work."
5,Katamino block puzzle is GOOD!,"I recently picked up Katamino at a local game store, and I must say I am very pleased with it. The puzzles that come with it are great, and I have no problems putting the pieces together! A nice thing about this game is that you can create many different configurations and then try to solve them. The version I bought was the portable one. The pieces store in a durable plastic container, making it simple to put away when not in use. A great puzzle game for kids (and adults) of all ages!"
5,My first book in Matlab,"This books is very good as an introductory for Matlab users, espcially engineers.. It contains alot of enineering problems solved using Matlab. It is good for freshmen students and engineers. It can be studied as a first course in computer programming, rather than Fortran, C or Pascal. I am a lectureur in Electrical Engineering Department. I would recomend it to be studied using this text book."
4,Great True Crime,"Very well-written, this story ranks high in my true crime top ten list . That it takes place in an area I'm familiar with, and that I remember when this happened, makes it even more interesting."
5,Brooklyner Scoops AR on her Own Turf!,"Paul LaRosa, Brooklyn New Yorker, producer of true crime reports on CBS 48 Hours, has taken on Ann Rule, Diva of True Crime Writing, in her own Pacific Northwestern backyard and Done Reel Good! Out in Tacoma, WA, Police Chief David Brame's wife was divorcing him, and telling things he didn't want told. With deft pacing, a la TV's 24, LaRosa leads the rapt reader down the path of domestic disintegration to the foreshadowed demise of the duo (they are both spoken of in the past tense from the get go.) /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
4,Tacoma Confidential Delivers,"Tacoma Confidential is a riveting, true-crime page-turner for basically two reasons: 1) The unbelievable circumstances of the crime (chief of police kills wife and himself in front of their two kids) 2) The unbelievable research done by the author to get into the heads of Tacoma Chief of Police, David Brame and his wife.Mr. LaRosa does his best (which is pretty darn good) to set the scene and mood in Tacoma, WA circa 2000, as David Brame makes his way up the beaucratic ladder to top law enforcement official, while simultaneously terrorizing his wife and pursuing sexual fantasy both in and outside his marriage. One of those books that would not be believed as fiction - but as a case history it leaves you shaking your head and wondering how it was allowed to happen. Scott Mitchell"
4,A very talented Author: Paul LaRosa,"This is a great book, one that manages to hold my attention no matter how many times I read it. Paul LaRosa does a wonderful job depicting this tragedy. If you love true crime books, you definitely want to read this one. I highly recommend this book."
5,Tacoma's Greatest Shame,"""The book that chronicles the 2003 tragic event that returned the true meaning of sin to Tacoma, Washington's well earned moniker `Sin City'. A must read for fans of true crime, students and officials of government and especially for the City of Tacoma officials and members of the Tacoma Police Department who allowed a senseless, cold blooded murder/suicide to happen.""-- John Hathaway, Publisher, The New Takhoman"
1,Horrible,"I'm surprised (shocked, actually) this book has received so many good reviews on Amazon. I found it horrible. It contains many contradictions -- for example, on one page LaRosa says every single journalist criticized the bartender-blogger who broke the case, and a few pages later, he quotes an editor complementing the same guy--, in lieu of facts he provides he says/she says (""Crystal said she only got $100 every two weeks, David's family says she got much more"" -- well, who is telling the truth? Isn't LaRosa's job to find out and tell us?) and his writing is mediocre at best. I have read very few true-crime books in my life, but if this is one of the better ones, then the genre sucks."
1,Disappointing,"This was NOT what I thought it was. It does not stop blood as it says. I usually try to keep this on hand for nail clipping time, just in case. My one occasion of using it was to find that it only made a mess and didn't stop the tiny bit of bleeding at all. Not sure if it all settled to the bottom of the bottle, but it doesn't ""shake"" enough to mix if that's the case."
2,Native easy listening is still easy listening,"While the version of ""Redemption Song"" is okay I don't see much here. Listen to a sample of the slam poet on track 11, ""Kealoha Bebop"" for an idea of how awful it can be; the (false) emotional tone of rap doesn't match the music in the slightest."
1,Love this barbie,I am an avid barbie collector and this is one of my favorite my husband likes it too. She has a beautiful outfit along with a great face not so much the ame as the other barbies
3,An Attention Getter,"The storyline held my attention as all of Connie Mason's books do; with the exception of The Reluctant Bride. Shadow Walker, however, was very good! The hero as always makes you wish that you could purchase him at the local shopping mall."
4,Surprisingly Good,I must admit I had little hope on this being a good book. BUT I was pleasantly surprised it kept me captive and want to turn back to it when I need to get other things done. Great book.
3,Interesting but a Little Racist,"This book had a lot of great information about how the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 affected the Spanish. It tells how they felt, what they did, what they thought, where they went. It even tells about what they thought the American Indians were thinking and feeling at the time. There are even passages citing American Indian quotations that were written by totally biased Spaniards from the time of the revolt! So, if you're interested in hearing just one side of a very important event, this is the perfect book. I think this really would be a good book if it were coupled with another book that attempted to show the other side."
5,A Wonderful Book About an Art Masterpiece,"Daniel Weiss has written an outstanding book on one of the great masterpieces of medieval art - Sainte Chapelle in Paris. His analysis and discussion tell us about this marvel of stained glass, and how it was built by King (Saint)Louis IX to house the Crown of Thorns and to make it the Christian equivalent of Solomon's temple in Jerusalem. Scholarly but readable, and beautifully illustrated."
5,Incredible Singing,"This is one of the best choral recordings you will ever own. Impassioned, beautiful singing with all the precision and discipline you expect in a choral recording. Buy it - you won't regret it!"
2,Not playable for the suggested ages,"This game requires advance reading and spelling skills, that a 4 year does not have. My 6 year old niece even had difficulties spelling some of the words. The suggested ages for the game is 4-6. I would say the starting age would be 6, unless your 4 year old can spell really well."
2,Inadiquate for younger children,"We purchased Scooby Doo with the system for our son on his 4th birthday. The loves the system but this game frustrated him, we spend more time playing it for him with him watching. It asks for skills that even a 6 year old would have such as picking two numbers that add up to 10, the child must pick the actual numbers like 2 and 8, there's no pictures, or in the underwater stage the child must fill in the missing letter from words, there's no outline for the missing letter or even a hint to the missing letter. My son loves watching Scobby, but I really don't know how much he's learning while we play it for him or he screams at it because he keeps dieing."
2,Not playable for the suggested age group,This is to advance and complicated for the age group suggested. My 4 1/2 year old son found it very fustrating. But we love the video system.
4,Wrong Age Range!!!,"This game was far too difficult for my 5&1/2 yr-old. It requires spelling of difficult words that I'm sure he won't learn until first or second grade. This would be more appropriate for 7-9 yr-olds. Stick with Winnie the Pooh and Lion King for this age group... well, actually, Pooh is better for 4-5 year olds, but my son absolutely loves it!I really like the V-Smile game system and I am impressed that someone finally came out wit hsomething that has educational value in every game instead of killing, fighting, etc. I think the game ratings are somewhat inconsistent and wish I had thought to check out parent reviews before purchasing the games.BTW: The game that comes with the set is wonderful. The difference between difficulty levels is perfect... now let's coordinate the rest of the games that way!"
5,great for 4-6 year olds,"My four year old and six year old love this game. It's probably their favorite. Yes, it requires spelling, but it's not difficult. Scooby's little roller coaster jumps up and collects the letters to spell out the word. But it's not like any points are docked for collecting a wrong letter. It's lots of fun."
4,Kids love Scooby Doo,"For kids a little older, this is the game to get. My son only plays this game on his V-Smile because he loves Scooby Doo. Some of the other character driven gamees are more for girls or for younger children. My son is seven, but has special needs and is at a Kindergarten level. I definitely do have to sit and help him, but he's catching on. I prefer to sit and help him with this than with the Gamecube. If you want your 3 or 4 year old to independently play with the V-smile this may not be the game for you. But, if you have a child who loves Scooby Doo and you don't mind providing assistance, then it's great.An update: My son's new favorite game is Spiderman. He likes the characters. It is VERY difficult for him to play, though. As a parent, if you are choosing between Scooby and Spiderman, I would go with Scooby."
3,Scooby Doo more fun at age 5,"The scooby doo game is fun and very educational for my 5 year old and 3 year old. Although I have to help my older son with the spelling of words & the math parts, such as even/odd numbers, repetition is the key with this game. He is memorizing many of the words and when I am in a different room he spells the word for me. My three year old is catching on to the navigation of the game but since he knows his letters already he is catching on to other areas too. Its fun but expect to sit and help your child with the words and other areas."
2,Vtech put wrong age on it,I love the vsmile system for my four year old. This game though has the wrong age on it. It is more for 6 to 7 year olds.
2,Scooby Doo V-Smile,Software was helpful to the child in learning how to use the joy stick. My son lost interest in this-somewhat repetitive and boring.
4,Great Product,"I bought this for my niece, and she loves it! She can't stop playing it, and it really helps with her education. I would advise anyone with a small child to invest in a V-Smile from age 3, because the games are geared toward young children to advance and enhance their education while making the games fun. They are easy to play, so the kids don't even need the adults to help them understand how to play the games."
2,For much older kids than package indicates!,"My 4 1/2 year old was very disappointed when he tried to play this game and could not. It requires spelling/reading, but yet is listed for ages 4-6. I wish my mother had read the reviews before purchasing - don't make the same mistake!"
3,Age suggestion shouldn't start at 4,"The age range starts at 4, but there is math involved to play the game as soon as you start. Personally my son is 4 and he wasn't able to play the game on his own."
2,a little disappointing,"My daughter and I greatly anticipated this game, but we are a little disappointed. Some of the 'Adventure Zone"" games are too juvenile."
5,Excellent!,"This is a very cool Nightmare On Elm Street-esque horror flick that does everything right. Great plot, great acting, Pam Grier, and awesome special effects are just some of the things this movie has going for it. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time, just waiting to see what disturbing imagery was about to be thrown at me next. If you are a fan of old-school Wes Craven, or just the horror genre in general, check this movie out. It's very good. The DVD is PACKED with extra features too...it's very worth it!"
4,It was good,"This movie was good, it would have got 5 stars but the ending was trash. The special effects are good and the story was good and the movie was tight up until the end, where it changed to garbage."
4,iss... aiight,"Besides seeing the beautiful and voluptuous Pamela Anne-Cassandra Grier I wouldn't recommend this movie. Ms. Grier and Snoop look like they are the only ones trying. Get it only if your a big fan of Snoop, Pam Grier, or that dude that Tupac shot in Juice. (review is to be read in low, non-threating monotone)"
2,Very very limp.,"I was actually excited about seeing this movie. The idea of Snoop Dogg as an undead pimp with revenge on his mind (And his mind on revenge) sounded pretty interesting. However, the execution of this movie is very poor. The screen time in owned by a group of unknown young actors and Snoop only gets about 20 total minutes of screen time. I expected some great campy humor out of this movie, one of those movies that is ""so bad that it is good"" but it was just so bad that it hurt. The movie just lingered on and on, and even though it's only and hour and a half, I lost my patience half way through. This movie could have been so much better if the script would have actually revolved around Bones, rather than a bunch of ineffectual characters who, by the end of the movie, serve no purpose whatsoever. This should have been straight to video."
1,THIS MOVIE IS A PILE OF CRAP!!!,Bones ranks amongst the worst and stupidest movies I have ever seen period.I cant see why anybody with good taste in movies would waste good money on this sorry ass movie.The front cover of the movie should automatically tell you that it's crap.And snoop dogg as the star actor should absolutely confirm to you of it's worthlessness.The plot is so simple and dumb that I wouldnt be surprised if snoop's son wrote it.The acting is horrible and the comedy is very lame.PLEASE DONT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
1,"What a ""sleeper""","This movie was just boring.No action,no gore,no plot. If you ca nt sleep, just rent this, you be sleeping in no time!"
1,oh my god,by far the worst movie on the face of the earth. no plot what-so-ever but there sure was a large amount of red paint on hand for the special effects. i don't know who thought this movie up or better yet who okayed the production ... my only advice is to get as far away from this movie as physically possible!!!!
2,I Feelt this movie could have been better!!!,"I've seen Snoop Dogg in a lot of movies and to tell you the truth he's probabley the worste actor I have ever seen, BUT in this film he did a great job of acting... it's as if he took acting classes. The movie was ok but not worth buying or adding to your DVD collection. The Plot was good but they didn't use it correctley... they could have done so much more, especially for the ending which just, how should i put it... [STUNK]! the blood in the movie looked more like paint instead of real blood and there was a lot of paint in this movie. It had some spooky parts in it and the killing scene were really good until it started to come close to the end, the killing scenes ended up to be more ridiculouse than anything else!! Some thought the movie was great i thought it was ok and i recommend Bones for renting but not for buying!!!!"
2,Snoop was good,"This movie wasn't that good. Snoop's character was good but most of the movie was actually kind of stupid. There were a lot of scenes that made me say ""Oh my God that's so dumb"" but there were also a few scenes that I thought were pretty cool. There was a lot of blood and gore in this movie, that's really the only thing that kept me interested. This is the kind of movie you watch once, not worth buying. Rent this one."
4,Blaxploitation at it's best,Bones is what intends to be a blaxploitation film for the nineties. You don't see many horror films with black casts like you did the seventies. Bones reminds of classic blaxploitation horror flicks like J.D.'s Revenge and Blackenstein. Snoop Dogg makes a wonderful villain and you actually root for his character. Khail Klain and Bianca Lawson are very good in supporting roles. My only complaint is that the film didn't have enough nudity like films of this kind normally do. It's still a lot of fun though and a great gulity pleasure.
3,does not cover gray,"I gave three stars because my hair feeling good after applying this cream, but it is absolutely does not cover gray, so if you want a little shine to your hair use it."
1,Thank You Keith,Keith is such a wonderful performer and I'm so glad he put out this DVD. Now I can watch whenever I want. I'm looking forward to seeing him live in the future and for the release of his next album. I just can't get enough!
3,Keith Urban - Video Hits,The video was good but there are only 6 videos on this dvd. I expected a lot more for my money on a dvd
4,Keith Urban- Video Hits,"A very good complication of Keith Urbans video's from his two first albums. A must have for someone like me, that don't have the possibility to see his videos on TV and naturally like his music. With hits like ""Somebody Like You,"" ""Raining On Sunday"" and ""Where The Blacktop Ends."""
5,Keith Urban DVD Video Hits- a good buy!,"This is his first DVD Video Hits, therefore its a must have!! If you've seen his videos on CMT, then you know this DVD is going to be HOT!! His songs are wonderful and I love to watch him sing, so this is exciting!!! The best part is you can watch him over and over and over!!"
5,You can't go wrong with Keith Urban!,"For excellent music, high energy, and terrific ""eye candy"", you can't go wrong with this DVD! Keith is a fantastic performer, and his talent -- both vocally and artistically -- shines through in all his videos!You won't want to miss your opportunity to OWN and watch his videos ANYTIME!!!"
2,Bad product,"Hard to punch the letter on my tool . I bought the graver , they made better and more easier."
4,Flaming Neon Red Hair,"Li Hong in his first directorial effort (that I could find) mixes dance and drama for this stylish thriller. Hong uses few words that assist the international viewer to focus on the cinematography. Tian Yuan (Luxury Car) assumes the role of Lola in a major dance troupe production when she observes the death of the leading actress. The wild dances of the character with flaming neon red hair and the choreography are highly stylized. Francis Ng (A Man Called Hero, One Last Dance) is a stagehand with a long list of past loves. His newest is Tian who assumes the role, but his previous love was the girl who was killed. The film proceeds languidly to the somewhat predictable rooftop climax and the unveiling of the true killer. Most interesting for the use of dance and the mix with drama, this stylish thriller is worth a night's viewing. Enjoy!"
2,slowwwwwwwwwwwwww,the movie started off great but got really slooowwww. not really horror movie but more of a drama mixed with some suspenseful aspects...the ending was also disappointing..
2,Not ready for prime time.,"Purchased this with the hope of making tenons and holding small pieces on the shaper. After assembly I checked the ""right angle"" of the tool on the table saw and found that top to bottom the face plate was off by about 3 degrees. Manual says to shim it to remove the error. But it didn't say where to place shims! Emailed Woodstock tech support and they said to check for burrs and that shimming was only a fine tuning adjustment. 3 degrees in not ""fine"". So it goes back to Amazon tomorrow."
1,will not buy it again,"I've bought it based on good reviews. I've used Colora products before but decided to switch as I couldn't find Colora black. Well, I've got a lot of black on the walls of my shower, on the pillow case, next day in the pool... And in couple of weeks, nothing black remained on my grey. Going back to Colora even if I have to switch the color."
1,Didn't work for me,This stuff is a mess to apply and doesn't get your hair black.The color that you do get will run out in about two weeks anyway so don't waste your money.
1,Very Disappointed!,"Very Disappointed! It's the worst product I ever tried. The color doesn't stay on your hair at all. Don't wast your money to try it!. BTW, it's not nature at all."
1,Made my hair green,"Hi there,I tried the henna fluid cause i thought it would be easier to apply than the real henna powder. Unfortunatly it turned out really dark green. I had to re-dye it with a normal chemical colouration..."
2,Disappointed,This product did not work as advertised. It imparts some color but not much. It didn't work too well for me.
2,Clumpy,This is the first time I've ordered this product and found hard clumps in it. I think this company sold me a defective or old bottle of color.
1,This product has changed from excellent to not-so-excellent!,"First of all, I received the box which was pretty beat up. Then I realized that the product was old. When I used it on my hair, it had a lot of gritty substance which I have no idea of what it was. I had to wash my hair THREE TIMES to get whatever this substance was out of my hair. It didnt cover much grey even after leaving it on for 1 hour. For the price, I dont think I will be purchasing from this vendor again, and will purchase directly from Surya if I can."
4,does a good job,"I have quite alot of gray, and this product covers very well. The down side is it does wear off, and can look a little brassy/copper colored. But in general, very satisfied with this product. I developed an allergy to the regular hair color products (anything containing PPD) and tried many henna products, but this one has been the best. The liquid/gel type consistency of this product makes it much easier to use than any other henna products I used where you had to mix it up yourself. DEFINITELY recommend!!"
2,Good group - poor product,"This is a prime example of the Collectables label putting out a poor quality product just to get an ""in demand"" group's recordings out. Restore your vinyl before you buy this CD, as the quality is in poor fake stereo, sounds swishy & phasey, plus the rare 45 tracks sound like they were taped off of an old turntable with a remote mic. The material here is half & half, either quite good, or quite weak and ome are simply poor take-offs of ""Oh How Happy"". I bought this, yet will listen to my restored vinyl instead. Good to see this release, but you'll most likely be disappointed in the sound quality...maybe someday they'll find masters for this.A Dick Bartley CD has a new stereo version of ""Oh How Happy"" but I prefer the LP/original single version with substantially more bass/drums. It has a good beat! For some reason this mix has been overlooked by time and present oldies stations and they play a weaker accapella version."
4,Good Book,"This book was very helpful in understanding the basic operations of my backberry. It had good tips that was very helpful and made the learning curve a lot easier. However, I had one problem with this book. It is an old issue and does not cover the latest devices. It would have been perfect if it had been updated."
2,Severely needs updating,"As someone who teaches Blackberry usage, I found this book useful for some really, really, basic info, but it just doesn't go far enough. For instance, the author tells you how useful the PIN feature is, but not how to use it. And there are simple features (such as 'encryption' and 'antialiasing') that a user will find by exploring her blackberry that are not mentioned in this book.Also, the author says you can not view any attachments on your BB. So not true. A ""viewer"" is always available on the 7200 & later models."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"As is often true of technical manuals, this is not up to date. Besides, Blackberry has excellent support on its web site. You don't need this and it won't be much use if you do need help."
2,doesn't help !,This book is useful only if you've lost your original BB manual. As there's hardly anything extra contained it that is not in the manual or the online assistance. I was particularly interested in how to use my BB as a modem for my laptop but totally disappointed. Its contents caters mainly to a 7290 model.
2,incorrect description by amazon,"the track listing is not even close. amazon describes this item as having 11 music tracks and 7 video tracks. WRONG! it has 3 audio tracks and 2 video. its basically a double single. NOT AN ALBUM! also, remember that as an import, the video portion is in region code 2 and not playable on US dvd players. .. otherwise, Tomoko rules!"
5,shoes,"I have owned Prowalkers for years. This the 5th or 6th pair. They are solid, comfortable, and wear well and are reasonable."
4,Good shoes,Good shoes. I like it because I tend to sweat in my feet with other shoes but not this one. I even wear it to my office. Recommend it.
1,Cheap Shoes!,"I am a big Rockport fan, and have purchased at least three pair of theRockport Men's World Tour Classic Walking Shoe, which is comfortable, comes in wide sizes and made of sturdy materials that last. Typically these make it 2-3 years of heavy, daily wear. A couple months ago I tried to purchase a new pair for these from Amazon and they were temporarily out of stock, so I decided to try this product, the Rockport Men's Prowalker Walking Shoe. What a mistake!!! The filmsy material the shoe is made from are already wearing, and since the manufacturer skipped out on putting metal rings where your laces thread through the shoe within two months my laces tore through the thin layer of material that held it! The shoes are basically ruined, but since I missed my return window I'm basically hosed. My warning, don't buy the Rockport Men's Prowalker Walking Shoe unless you're looking for disposable footwear."
4,Nice but a bit stiff,"I owned a pair of these years ago, loved them and decided to get another pair. These are good fit but a little stiff. I'm hoping that will go away once I break them in and scuff them up a bit so they don't look so neon white.Overall, a great pair of shoes for walking."
2,Prowalker quality downgrade,"I have been buying a pair of white Rockport Prowalkers for ten or twelve years and have remained loyal to the brand because of the excellent wear they gave me and their superb comfort. Something has changed recently in this series of shoes. The leather is much stiffer and the shoes are just not as comfortable. They still give good arch support and the assembly quality seems okay, but only time will tell how they hold up to daily use. I hope Rockport returns to their high standards of manufacturing in the future. I'll probably look for something else when it's time to replace these. The color white is more like an ivory color now. Before they were pure white."
1,Rockport ProWalker,"The service for this was fine. No complaints. However, the shoe itself is another thing. First, I chose white. When it arrived, it was an off-white. My husband was willing to live with that. But then, after wearing the shoes a couple of times, he said they were extremely uncomfortable. We have purchased Rockport ProWalkers in the past & loved them. This was quite a disappointment."
2,The design of this madel has changed.,"If you have worn Rockport Prowalker in the past please note that the design of this shoe has changed over the past 1-2 years. I recently ordered a pair and the padding is much reduced, the leather is not as soft. The shoes may be OK and well made but they are not the style you may be used to if you have worn this stlye in the past."
1,Fake Rockports?,"They look like plastic, feel like wood, and wear like paper. This is by far the lowest quality, least comfortable shoe I have ever paid this much money for. I found myself looking for signs that the shoes were counterfeit. Unfortunately, this is just one more company that went from making a quality product to selling cheap foreign crap. It's sad to see another good company go bad. Save your money for a better quality shoe."
1,rockport prowalker shoe,"I have been wearing rockport walkers, almost exclusively, for many years so Iordered the shoes in my ususal size. It was too small and I had to return itand I had to pay for the return because I did get what I ordered. Not worth itand I wll never buy shoes, clothes, or other previously untested items online."
5,Men's Walking Shoe,"Comfortable even if worn all day. Have a semi-dress look and can be worn for most occasions as well as daily usage. the only time I dont wear them is at home (slippers) or very formal occasions. The finish on the camel color I wear does not last as long as the black but is reasonably durable. Shoe wear depends on one's feet. Some will find they last, some will find they wear out quickly."
3,shoe,This is not the shoe that it replaced. It is not as comfortable and the shoe strings have trouble staying tied. I know of one other person who has similar shoe and he has trouble with the strings also. I would wish that previous quality was revived. By the end of the day I feel as if I can feel every thread in my shoe as well as the inner sole.
1,deceiving,"poor quality, leather thinner, less confortable than before. Better buy Rockport WT Classic for a few bucks more !"
1,Prowalker walking shoe,This is the first pair of this specific model which I have purchased in over 5 years. I have probably owned 10 pairs of this very same model over the years. This shoe is not even close to the quality I am accustomed to and I have worn it only once because it just looks and feels cheap. I should have returned it immediately after purchase but it sits on the shoe rack. Needless to say I am very disappointed in my purchase and the quality of the product. Bud-
1,rockport men's shoe-prowalker,"I was told to expect the shoes to arrive on 14 Sept. As of today-20 Sept, it has NOT arrived. Who can I talk to to track it and find out when (if) it will arrive? Please call me at Home 301-627-5664/ cell 240-305-5981.Hoping to hear from you-Yours truly, James Storey"
3,Good Quality but too expensive,Why buy here when you can get the first pair at a Rockport outlet for $10 or more less and then a second pair for half off that lower price??Need to be careful. These days Amazon does not always offer the best value!
3,"Decent shoe, decent price","These were a good deal for the price paid, though they seem to run a half size smaller than labeled."
1,"They were excellent in the past, now they are trash.",What a disapointment. Bought them a few times in the past. The only thing that hasn't changed is the look and name. They are a total misfit and give no support. I guess Rockport doesn't care what it sells.
2,Width not the same as last pair puchased.,The last pair I got were marked medium width. They fit good. This pair (which was returned) was marked medium but the were to narrow.
2,What happened to the quality?,"I agree that the Rockport ProWalker just isn't what it used to be.It's tight and stiff and in spite of ordering the same size as usual it doesn't fit.And, no, my shoe size has not changed!"
1,Failed after less than one year,"These broke after less than one year of light to moderate usage. They didn't wear out -- the leather tore around one of the lacing holes.My biggest surprise was that Rockport wouldn't do a thing. They said that they cannot handle warranty claims.I've always had good experiences with Rockport, but this certainly gives me pause."
5,shoe heaven,"Over the years I have tried a number of different walking shoes.Some,were not bad at all.Several years ago,a friend suggested that I should try rockport shoes.What a difference,these are truly the most comfortable shoes I have purchased.Besides being comfortable they also are quite durable.No need to say more/rockports are first class all the way."
4,Changed the sizing information,"I wear nothing but ProWalkers but the one thing that bothers me is the change in how they show the size on the tongue. I wear size 12 wide and until now it has been shown as ""12W"" under the ""USA"" letters. On my latest pair, it is simply shown as a ""12"", but now there is a string of numbers above the ""USA"" that ends in a ""W"". Since I have to rip out the insoles to put my arch supports in, I wanted to be sure that I did indeed have the correct size and not a 12 regular. Well it took me having to talk to 3 people at Peltz Shoes on the phone to confirm this. I guess I'll go rip out the insides of my shoe now and hope they are right."
1,Another ProWalker Devotee Looking Elsewhere,"I will add my voice to the chorus of longtime wearers terribly disappointed w/ the quality of the 2012 ProWalker model. My current pair (purchased in late 2009) is my tenth in twice as many years. To date, these shoes have consistently surpassed my expectations in wear, comfort, and support - from day one. And that is exactly how long the 2012 version lasted on my feet; stiff, narrow, and uncomfortable with every step. The drop in quality is stunning. I believe I now understand why the Rockport dealers have been drying up in my area.On the seller-side, they were quick to process the return with no hassles whatsoever."
2,Things Have Changed at Rockport,"I've been wearing Rockports for a number of years and have always been very satisfied, but something has changed! The quality is noticeably declining while the prices remain steady or increase. My latest pair of Prowalkers seem flimsy, provide less support and are made of an ugly grainy leather rather than smooth leather. The new ones have scuffed quite easily within the first month of wear (my older ones never did scuff) and they are not as comfortable as previous pairs.When I contacted Rockport customer service, I received a boiler plate reply e-mail that thanked me for my feedback and said they were happy that I like their products. Not the response I was looking for! I'm looking for a new brand of walking shoes and casual shoes."
3,Rockport Prowalker,"The shoes are quite comfortable, but I find them very uncomfortable while doing extended exercise walking."
1,These Rockports are Rock HARD.,"I waited 6 months in order to give a fair review, and hoping somehow the soles would soften up and ""wear in"". But not happening. No softening up going on. The black color and style is fine but the sole is very hard and uncomfortable. These shoes are terrible, and maybe I got suckered with a knock off or something (no way to prove). I'm very disappointed with these shoes. I expected better from Rockports. Now I just have to ""make do"" with them. But maybe this is what $40 Rockports are. If you like even a hint of cushion in your shoes, these ain't for you. Instead of walking shoes they're more like ""walking"" shoes. If you walk a lot at work, these will kill your feet. This is my first ever extremely negative review of any Amazon item, but this is how bad these shoes are. Don't be regretting like me. Youre way better off buying athletic walking or running shoes. Peace out bro."
2,not as confortable as running shoes,"this shoe is not comfortable like running shoe,the sole is hard , and flat , and little heavy ."
2,Rockport Men's Prowalker-Walking Shoe,"I was very dissapointed when I received subject shoes. I thought I was going to receive a high-end of the Prowalker based on the list price of $89 on Amazon. I had previously purchased Rockport Prowalker shoes from local stores that were in this price range but they were far more superior....they had more cushion that made them more comfortable. The only reason why I did not return these shoes is because I only paid $29 for them. The shoes were listed at $89 marked down to $59 and I received an additional $30 discount (gift certificate) for applying for an Amazon credit card. Believe me, the shoes that I received are not worth $89 or even $59.....I basically felt like I was deceived."
2,shoe size conversion,"My Rockport shoe size in Australia is USA 9 W however this size was unavailable as an option for selection online. I carefully read the shoe conversion tables provided and ordered what I considered to be the nearest match, size USA 9 M. - These arrived however are far too small (especially in width)I sent accurate measurements of my foot size to Amazon however they were unable to assist with my conversion dilemma. They kindly offered to accept a return of the goods however I found that the return freight charge to be almost the same as the cost of the shoes.This is my first order placed through Amazon.... I have found all communications very friendly and the paperwork etc thorough. Unfortunately the outcome has been disappointing and a total waste of money."
1,Item not at all as advertised - Amazon screwed up return,"As you can see from the picture, this is a shoe with laces. Since the vendor apparently didn't have the item that I ordered, they sent me a loafer instead. But that wasn't the end of it. I returned the shoes in the same box, using the Amazon label. Amazon processed the refund and, on the following day, sent me an e-mail confirming receipt of the return. Seven weeks later, I received another e-mail from Amazon stating: ""Because we have not received the item(s) to be returned, we charged your payment instrument"". So, as far as I'm concerned, I can't rely on the vendor or on Amazon."
1,Wrong Size from Amazon,I ordered size 10 1/2 and received size 10. Didn't notice until I had worn them so too late to send them back.
2,Standard sizes????,"Nice shoe except, it doesn't conform to standard sizes. I bought the 12N size shoe. My foot is A/AAA. Really narrow feet! But somehow this shoe is severely pinching my little toes. I walk on my job over 20,000 paces five nights a week. So purchasing these were a waste of money. I'm willing to try the next size up though and give you a review later. But I suspect that maybe the manufacturer is using the wrong standards (Intl in lieu of US) and should publish their sizing standards in the descriptions."
2,rockports prowalker,"my last pair of prowalkers had a made in china tag,i'm not so sure the shoes are of the same quality as before."
2,Merchandise not new,The shoes which I received appeared to have been slightly used. I would not use this merchant adain.
2,Watches should keep time!,"I love this watch...it's very pretty and feels good around the wrist because of the bracelet style. I just wish it kept the time! About once a week, it just stops or has the wrong time. I set the time and it starts working again for about another week. I changed the battery and it still happens so I know that is not the problem. This is the second Seiko watch that I have had the same problems with. I spent almost half of the purchase price on repairs for the last one and still had problems. I won't do that again with this one but I won't buy Seiko when this one finally stops working altogether."
5,Great introductory cookbook for kids,"I purchased this book to use as part of a weekly cooking show [...] I do for my nieces and nephews who live far away. This cookbook does a great job of explaining cooking basics while providing some fun recipes as well. Most of them are appropriate for children age 10+ to make on their own and for those younger cooks, plenty of the recipes have jobs for them to do as well. I recommend this book for anyone looking to introduce children to the kitchen."
4,Fun Cookbook for Kids,My daughters and I have enjoyed a few recipes from the book. It is several basic recipes with numerous variations. It is not a complete cookbook by any means but there are some fun and different ideas. The illustrations and directions are great for elementary school children just starting to read and those able to read just starting to learn to cook.
3,Hard to find this book,"It is for kids learning to cook. Recipes are simple. The book is out of print, so the seller really raised the price, my granddaughter really enjoyed it"
5,I agree with James Scally,Itchy twitchy feelin is one of the most (if not the most) rockinest songs recorded in the whole golden rock n roll era. I mean this song just cooks from beginning to end with one of the best sax breaks of any Rock nRoll song. The Coasters backed up Bobby on this rockin classic from 1958 and it really should've been a number 1 pop and R&B hit. But it only made it to the 20's on the pop charts and to #5 on the R&B chart-but heck who cares.Bobby was greatly influenced by his idol Clyde McPhatter and he and Dee Clark could've substituted for Clyde in the 50's and noboby would've noticed the difference(they both had Clyde down to a tee). But neither Clyde nor Dee ever rocked and cooked on a song like this one. This song is a true representation of 50's Rock nRoll.
4,The ultimate software for Mac and PC owners!,"I used my PC and my Mac extensively and for awhile I have been copying files from my zip disk via Mac to my PC and vice versa and with the 250mb zip drives reading 100 disks so slow, I dreamed of what if I could network my Mac G4 via OS X to my PC.Well, Dave 3.1 is the ONLY software out for MAC OS X at this present time and I don't know how grateful I am for this software. If you you use a Mac and a PC and are in need of file sharing or networking between the two different platforms, simply there is literally no software that is out right now that is more convenient than Dave 3.1. It's easy, it's fast and pretty much you install the software and from there it's a breeze! I was transferring files from my Mac to my PC and vice versa quickly.Especially beneficial if you are doing huge file transfers! What a life and time saver! I give it a 4 (actually a 4.5), I do think it maybe a bit costly to some but still, it's worth it!"
5,I honestly recommend.,I do not work for Super Nutrition or have any ties with the company. I saw the vitamins at Whole Foods a few years ago and decided to try them out. I haven't had a better vitamin. I do actually feel the results and the day-to-day grind seems alot more barable than without it. My diet isn't as healthy as it probably should be so after each meal I take two tablets to balance out my diet. It really helps me and I have my wife taking the prenatal blend. The natural ingredients help me feel better about taking it too.
2,"Short on Information, but tells a good story","If you are looking for new information on the ""Star Trek: Universe"" this is not the book to look to, but if you are looking for ideas for your Role Playing Campaigns then this might be of some help. It was a little disappointing to open up ""A Fragile Peace : The Neutral Zone Campaign"" and not see the vibrant colors that make the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation Role Playing Game Core Rule Book"" really stand out."
1,Tough to use,"Complete Home Designer lets you enter room dimensions, one room at a time, and then place the room on the grid. Placing the room on the grid is the trick. It is very difficult to locate room 2 with respect to room 1. As you try to move it, the dimensions change and the location changes with it. You get into an unending loop of moving and resizing. If you ever get your layout correct, the program dimensions the rooms very nicely, if a little clumsily. I never got much further because it took too much effort to get a simple plan entered."
1,You're better off with a pencil and ruler,I got this program a week ago and I've yet to figure it out. The floor plan modes are complicated and cumbersome. On many occasions the program prevents me from making walls at certain angles and certain lengths.
1,No support,"I purchased the Data Beck Home Desing and Renovation over two weeks ago, (still not operating). I have emailed the support center to tell them the download required from their site is not loading and is a glix necessary (as they say) to operate and to please advise.Still nothing. As this is software and not returnable to the store. I am stuck with it....definately choose any other product than this one.Save yourself the headaches."
1,Dieses ist Abfall (This is Garbage),"This software is garbage. It's obvious that it was put together in Germany because a lot of the pop-up-type windows are in German! I can't read German. I was flying blind! If their QA process is so bad that they don't even bother to change the German to English (this is an American market after all) for basic functions, then I'm afraid to know what else is wrong. I returned it to the store where I got it because it's defective."
1,Disappointed,I really like Alia slacks. They are true to size and easy care. The pants that arrived were of some different material (micro-fiber) and looked like rags. REALLY DISAPPOINTING. The micro-fiber pants don't look as nice as the usual Alia pants and the waist isn't as comfortable either. I sent them back for a refund.
4,Two for the Money,"Excellent quality. Jocks and sports betters will love it. Al Pacino, Rene Russo & Matthew McConaughey turned in great performances."
2,Average at Best,"As with the laborious ""Any Given Sunday"", this is another attempt to portray pro football without mentioning the NFL. We only hear about team cities (New York, Tampa Bay, etc), never team nicknames. And any mention of real players, naturally, is forbidden. So the movie itself has a certain phoniness about itself that can't be avoided . [We know the real NFL would never want to actually acknowledge that people gamble on their games.]The other dubious part of the movie is this concept of the Sport Sevice getting paid a commission on the winning bets of the customers. How would they know what people bet? The honor system? The whole idea is implausible. And once this fails the whole movie lacks a certain edge needed for believability.Within this framework, the performances were good, but the movie never quite does it for me. Cannot recommend."
1,Hate it when Jesus gets the F word as a middle name,Language is awful. Acting was good but the who cares when the dialogue assaults you. Pachino's adlibed profanity just gets worse as he gets older. Usually you see that behavior in adolescents.
3,Two for the Money,"It was just ok - didn't have enough action or thought provoking scenes. I'm a big fan of Pacino but found this not his best film. The plot, or lack of, was draggy and uninteresting and found myself leaving the movie several times and fast forwarding to see if there was any action somewhere in the movie. Sorry, not impressed."
4,two for the money,the movie was very interesting but could have used less intidimating characters. Just showing the ups and downs of gambling would have been a better storyline in my opinion.
4,Two for the money,"Great movie I think the two actors played off of each other well , worth the price"
2,Self-Hype,"This is a good GUY flic, nothing special, but fun for gamblers and football fans. The whole thing is kind of a self-hype, true story. The gambling predictor as ladies man and hero, puffed up and glamorized, but the fantasy is the thing for young men. Gambling, chicks, and swell clothes is what it's all about. Shallow, no?"
2,just ok at best,"Al Pacino goes through the motions alot of time in most of His Modern films with the usual over the top long winded speech&what have you.I'm a Huge fan of Al Pacino,but I can't think of the last film of his that I dug where I didn't get his Billy Graham Sermon. as for Matthew McConaughey a cat that should be better than what he usual presents on the screen.this film examines Betting on Football&the addiction of it. but this film is more style over substance&it costs this film in the bigger picture."
4,For Gamblers,"So first of all if you don't bet on sports (especially football) you probably won't ""get it."" If you DO bet on sports, you will find it very funny, sad, pathetic and generally a good time. For those that bet, we can relate to the very high highs and very low lows of gambling. From a last second ""Hail Mary"" that ruins your day, to a 5 td easy bet, this movie DOES get it. The emotions of the characters are dead on and very realistic. I enjoyed it; my favorite line, ""I lost $300,000...I had a life!"" LOL, priceless!P.S. My advice on betting? if you don't have money to lose, then you don't have money to win."
2,For football fans,"Didn't read what this movie was about before I watched. The sports and gambling theme was not my cut of tea. The sports jargon was lost on me, Al Paccino's character having a daughter seemed unnecessary, and the gamblers anonymous scene was stupid. People who like sports might like this move better than I did."
2,Couldn't Sit Through It,"I'm giving this movie two stars becuase McConaughey looks really good with his shirt off (one star) and it has Pacino and Russo (the other star). After twenty five minutes, I decided I was wasting valuable time of my life watching this forgettable and worthless story.The end."
1,Terrible!! Too much profanity and bad language!,It was painful we had to stop watching this because of the constant profanity. My husband and I started getting a headache and could not enjoy the movie. We don't gamble and we don't use bad language so this was too much for us. I can't believe Al Pacino has such a dirty mouth. Don't waste your time and money!
1,punchless drivel,"This money sucked.They tried to include about ten different storylines, and none of them took.The whole premise of the movie is lame. A betting service that gives you picks and only collects if you win? Yeah right. Like anyone would setup a business like that. Then there's the TV show. The only thing said on the TV show is ""Call us to get picks."" That's a commercial, not a show.Stupid movie. Stupid premise."
2,Not without value but definitely dry,"If you are a King James reader it might go well with you , I however am not . Although it is not quite that antiquated it is certainly English that does not flow when read."
4,Its purely awesome!,This CD is by far one of the best Persian CDs I have ever bought. The music is so up-lifting....I love the international theme!
5,Fantastic!! Never read better!!!,This book was one of his best. The journey was well described and the food made my mouth water.
1,The most awesome of books!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,""" I loved it. Twas jolly good! Wot Wot Can't bally wait till thare's anothar one.Wot Wot Sithee it is a jolly good book yah know."
4,A Great and Sad Story,"I always enjoy reading a good Brian Jaques book. His Redwall series is definitely enchanting. This one in particular is quite enticing. It tells the story of a few young maidens from redwall who find a rhyme that may lead to the Pearls of a legend. Full of adventure they begin their search. Along the way however, they find that although the search may lead to something glorious, it may also mean that a few of them may not live to see the all of the pearls together. The ending of the story is totally unexpected but also enjoyable. It is a fun story and although it is also a very sad tale if you read it you will be hooked."
3,Good but not Great,"I have read all the Redwall books except for the newest one, Marlfox, and have loved them all. This one was satisfactory, like all the others, but I just didn't think it was as good as the others. It was missing something that all the other books had, but I can't tell what. The charactors were very shallow. I think every true Redwall veteran should notice this. Also, I didn't like the Martin 2 idea very much, the name should be just for the first one. In case you think I have been to harsh in this review, just remember I think it is good, just not the best."
3,Medeocre Adventure,"Pearls of Lutra, by Brian Jacques, is part of the Redwall series and i believe deserves 3 stars. This book has many songs and poems, most of which are just filling up space, but the main character is very intriguing. I would recommend this book to kids under the age of 15 because all the characters are animals and the songs and poems are good for the little kids to enjoy. I enjoyed most of this book and i hope you do too."
2,Not Highly Suggested,"Pearls of Lutra is not a very good book. Redwall fans should read this book, but I would not suggest it to anyone just starting the series. The characters are extremely shallow, no depth in charactarism whatsoever.The plot has no depth at all.The first attractive point about this book is the 'woodland creature' theme. It is interesting to have the heroes be mice and otters. The second point is that it will be on interest to veteran Redwall readers. It has interesting glimpses from the time of Mattimeo, and several characters returning from earlier books.I would not suggest reading this book to anyone but veteran Redwall fans."
4,Most exotic redwall book yet :Pearls of Lutra,"This book takes the reader farther away from the actual Redwall Abbey than any other book so far in this series.Much of it takes place on a remote island out way west across the sea.There lives this story's main villain,Ublaz,or Mad Eyes,and he controls a whole army of monitor lizards[imagine that!].The riddles are the best yet.The plot is epic,the storyline grand.The characters are pretty good;some funny,others sad.[Some moments in this book are heartbreaking!]I also think this book is kind of dark[some parts].Lots of fighting and revenge and the like,as in the other Redwall books.But this is still a fantastic choice for Redwall fans and others interested.Fantastic!"
5,EVEN BETTER THAN CANDIED CHESTNUTS AND OCTOBER ALE!,"Praise Haaaaaaaaaaawn Brian! Another great book from the series! I found Tansy to be an ok character, but my favorite had to be Grath. I am partial to badgers, otters, and hares. Clecky was very funny, and oi also loikd they moles. The riddles were a wonderful touch, and I managed to solve a few myself. I liked Inbar and Romsca (she was the only half-DECENT corsair>:-}). Something more should have happened to the Abbeybeasts, like in Mattimeo when the ravens attack Redwall. Overall this was a good book, one that any Redwall fan should read. (it was cool when a certain trident-rat and a certain fox killed eachother!) HOLT LUTRAAAAAAAAA! EULALIAAAAAAAAAA! REDWAAAAAAAAAAALL!"
5,i thought that the book was a great success,i loved the part when she threw the pearls off into the ocean and i thought that it was sad when piknim died by the jackjaws
5,The Pearls of Lutra diplays Brian Jacques at his best.,"The Pearls of Lutra is by far the best of the Redwall series. Maybe it is me, but I think Jacques' two latest books, Marlfox and The Long Patrol, lack the same richness all of his other books possess. Perhaps I am too old now though (14), to experience the magic I once felt. However, no child should leave ANY of the Redwall series unread. Brian Jacques is a wonderful storyteller, and he is able to spin tales of such fantastic places that it is hard to pull yourself away. If you haven't read any of his books, go! The entire cast of Redwall is waiting for you..."
4,Pretty Good,It was fairly a good book. It saved Outcast of Redwall's humiliation but some of the adventure was lacking. The baddie (Ublaz) was kinda cheezy but the riddles were real mindbogglers.
5,A Great Book!,The Pearls of Lutra is a exciting and adventurous book. It's characters are full of life and very interesting. One of my favorite books!
5,The Dubbiuns Rock!,"I read Redwall alot, and this is my favorite. I love Arven the Dubbiun (i'm a likkle maggit..) Unlike some of the other books, this one has a lot of Dubbiuns in it. I love the Dubbiuns, so cute.. Anyway, this book is about the quest for the six rose colored pearls, better known as the Tears of The Sea. Mad Eyes, the main villan ( why are all the head hanco ba guys insane?!?!?), is after the pearls, and the Redwallers must get them back an return them to Holt Lutra. ( where the otters are from) Its' a great book, its got all the good charaters in it, Dubbiuns, otters, hares, & Log-a-log. Theres a suprise at the end, that i wasn't exscepting, but i won't give it away. Read it! Just one thing Mr. Jaques,no offence, but are you obsessed with death? you seem to kill my favorite charaters alot. REDWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAALL!"
4,"It is a good book, but not the best of the bunch","This book is definitely not the best of the Redwall series. However, it is also one that I would recommend any Redwall-crazy Brian Jaques fan to read. Mr. Jaques missed out on something in this book, and although I can't quite tell what it is, it is very obvious to any Redwall veteran. It includes, revenge, theft, trechery, bravery, and many other important factors in the plot and is not recommendable to someone who is starting out in the Redwall series. But I still praise Brian Jaques for most definitely writting another good, great Redwall book"
4,Great,"This one is not very good at the start but after book 1 it gets awsome. The end fight is cool, but it ended the same as The Marial of Redwalll: the bad guy gets bit by it's pet snake or scorpian, overall a good read."
4,Pearls of Lutra was a good book overall and very exciting!,"The Pearls of Lutra was another one of Brian Jacques's wonderful books. It's about a young hedgehog named Tansy, trying to find six beautiful pink pearls to ransom her Abbot with. On the other side is a cruel pine marten, Ublaz Mad Eyes, with a hypnotizing stare and an army of trident rats and monitor lizards to help him. This was a good book, but I don't think it was quite as good as his others. I don't think it was quite as good because when finding the pearls, it only takes Tansy maybe one or two days to find each,where in others it took the searchers more like five to seven days. Also there wasn't much of a fight between the two main warriors, Ublaz just sort of lays down after the snake gets him"
4,The Pearls Of Lurea,"The Pearls Of LutraIf you like animal fiction, or adventure, you're in for a good book. Far away on the island of Sampetra Ublaz referred to as Mad Eyes and his monitors fight corsairs and sea rats while Martian and friends of Redwall fight Mad Eyes for the Abotof Redwall find out what happens when you read the book The Pearls Of Lutra."
4,Pearls of Lutra,"I've read all of the Redwall books except #14, and Pearls of Lutra is one of my favorites. On the Island of Sampetra, the Emperor mad eyes rules. He is trying to find the Tears of all Oceans, which are hidden within Redwall Abbey.Each chapter is filled with suspense as 4 different armies try to annialate each other."
4,Nice chain,a good chain at a great price. Works well and should last a long time as long as i keep it out of the ground.
3,Not a very long life between sharpening,"This chain works very well to break down limbs and small branches. It will last for many hours in this use. However, once you use it to cut up a few (3 or 4) 10-12"" hardwood logs you'll find it dulling quite quickly. The saw definitely has the power to get through the wood but the blades just don't last. I think it's the technique used to sharpen them. It produces a hollow bevel thats pretty thin and dulled easily.If all you plan on doing is pruning small 3-4"" branches this chain is perfect and will last hours and hours. Anything larger and it'll be up in smoke in no time flat."
5,History,I loved this book. The illustrations helped my imagination while reading the chapters. Recommended for a 2nd grader. Not a long read so perfect for oral reading for a history lesson.
3,"good for dovetails, but lousy box joints","I should have done more homework before buying this jig, but I was just starting out and never made a dovetail before. My first attempt with this jig, after mounting it to the wood piece, went well and it was a nice look. But I tried the box joint method and it was terrible. There is so much slop in the results that it can only work well for one half of the joint. Cut one piece with this jig, but then measure out and cut the mating half on your own.I will buy the Leigh D4 dovetail jig system asap, because not only is it the best, but I like the idea of the custom spacing possible with it. Most every jig for dovetails won't allow custom spacing of the dovetails or other joints. But the Leigh is totally custom and you don't end up with the ends falling half way through a joint, if you don't want."
5,Easiest through dovetails ever,After doing a bit of research I purchased the Keller Journeyman jig from Amazon. The first set of dovetails I cut using the jig were perfect!The only setup required is to screw the jig to a board of appropriate thickness. Once that is done you can start cutting perfect through dovetails of any length. It is even possible to vary spacing though that does require a (small) bit of thinking and planning.
4,First Dovetail Jig,"The Keller 1500 jig was very simple to get into working order with the assrmble of the backer block. I cut the first set of joints in 3/4"" scrap pine I had in the shop. Great fit - no issues. The scribe mark on the jig for backer board location makes great, tight joints right from the start.I bought the Keller to dovetail a 16"" run of 1/2"" thick baltic birch plywood for some custom boxes. I tried the jig on 1/2"" baltic birch and the tear out was terrible. Maybe this jig is only good for non-laminated woods?It did work sensational right out of the box. The directions are not hard to follow. I would have liked a specific book for the 1500 verses one page stuck in the book for the 1600.I would give this product 4 stars."
5,I'm a pro now! No really...I am...,"Easy to use, and perfect dovetails in very fast time. Makes people think you are a pro, even if you are a screwup like me!"
5,Awesome squirt guns,He is hilarious and discusses the truth about life and marriage and family... kids and squirt guns all I'm saying #MUST WATCH Him NOW
2,Did not fit elongated toilet,I had this same make and model from probably 5 years ago that fit well an elongated toilet but this replacement would not tighten-up. It was probably just short a quarter of an inch in the adjustment to hold it tight to the toilet. Otherwise quality is good and delivery was on time. Carex was contacted but they did not provide any help. I thought they should have provided a spacer to attach to the front pad but they said they did not have one.
5,Recommend,I purchased this to use after my bi-lateral knee replacement surgery. It was extremely helpful since I couldn't bend my knees very well for a few weeks. Handles helped in getting up and down.
4,"Sturdy, comfortable seat","I bought this for my dad and it has made it much easier for him to get on and off the john. The handles are sturdy and well positioned to really help him. Smooth surfaces are easy to clean.I am a little concerned about the lock-in mechanism, operated by screwing a little clamp to fit in the toilet bowl. (The grey gizmo on the front turns the screw) It shakes a little and feels as if very heavy person who pulled or pushed the arm rests forward rather than down might dislodge it, but I am sure that the manufacturers have tested that.For something plastic and light, though, I think it is reliable."
2,Print Problems,I have had my Lexmark 5700 for 2 1/2 years at first it printed OK. I have printed a low to moderate amount with it. As with the other reviews I have had major problems with the black ink. Mine now will not print black unless the heads have been cleaned each use and then only after at least 5 pieces of paper have been run through. Not worth the effort anymore.
2,used to be a good printer,i have had my lexmark 5700 for a little over a year & although it used to be pretty dependable - more recently i have been having issues w/ the unit : i have had to replace the black printer cartridge 3 times now within a 2 month period : my printing activity is normal to below normal : i find support for the lexmark printer is also lacking - if not substandard
2,Incompatible with IBM Aptivas,"After buying this printer with my IBM Aptiva, I found out they were incompatible. After calling the IBM helpdesk, I was told by the IBM helpdesk that this was a known problem and the 'work-around' was to shut down the system, completely unplug everything but the power cord from the CPU, power it up, shut the system down again, plug in everything BUT the printer, power it up. After it powers up, shut it down one more time, plug in the printer and start it up. Seriously!!!Note: This doesn't always work. If you have an Aptiva, don't buy this printer. If you have this printer, don't get an Aptiva. It's too bad because when the printer did work it was relatively fast for a home user with nice color contrast."
4,Lexmark 5700 is a laser quality printer,"Very high quality printing, and fast too. ideal for photo printing on most paper types."
3,Little substance,"The information presented in Mr. Molotsky's book would boil down to a good Smithsonian or National Geographic article, but feels padded out at 240 pages. In fact, the book had its origins as a NY Times article on the restoration of the flag that flew at Ft McHenry.The author repeatedly goes over the same ground, labors certain points while skimming over other seemingly crucial information, quotes lengthy excerpts, and goes off on tangents that seem to have nothing to do with the central premise.Still, I learned a thing or two about a glossed-over chapter in American history. It may whet your appetite for more in depth coverage of the subject."
5,Great Little Item,It turns out I am very pleased that I purchased this little tabletop tri-pod. It works well and I've gotten some great shots with it when I didn't feel like setting up my big tri-pod.
4,Good buy,"The legs will need to be adjusted accordingly. Seems to be a durable product. I'm using it for a range scope, it has no issues supporting the weight."
5,pretty slik,"This is a home run for me, worth every penny. I do table top photography. I need a good full tilt down without it tipping over and this is perfect. Nothing flaky about its design. Folds up beautifully. Solid construction. Adjustments are a breeze, finally something that works! Base at lowest height is approx 9 inch diameter, and a center leg has a suction cup at lowest setting so it grabs a nice flat surface and becomes anchored so you can do adjustments with out the base moving. I give it a four stars for construction because the legs dont have a locking type mechanism just relies on pressure to hold position, they do have a good feel when adjusting, maybe long run it will loosen up and become not so great. Time will tell, but worth it anyway. This can hold a SLR no problem."
3,"Okay, but use with a light weight non-critical application","This isn't the tightest tripod, it has a good deal of shake in it compared to other tripods.I like how compact it is, and how light weight it is.I would recommend this tripod if you have a light weight point and shoot, but skip if you are concerned about movement with heavier tripod.*Note I compared this with a hunting spotting scope, and it was inferior to the kit tripod.The issue is that the many adjustments each have a bit of give when tight.Okay, but use with a light weight non-critical application"
5,Very stable desktop tripod,I bought this tripod to handle me DSLR. I couldn't be happier with the price or construction. Very well made and I don't have to worry about my camera tipping this tripod over.
3,OMG it's heavy,"It's fine -- secure and stable, and it's easy enough to use. But it's very heavy. Very, VERY heavy. My husband doesn't mind though.Get it if you have someone who would carry it."
5,Excellent Starting Point,"I have watched several DVDs and this is the only series I have ever stuck with. He takes the time to show you the moves and the link them all together in the form. Although I have never gone to a class, I don't believe that any DVD will ever take the place of a good one on one or one on class instruction. But for those of use short on cash and time to go to the gym this is a great place to start. I finish and I feel stronger and more relaxed every time."
4,Well begun half done.,"Scott Cole has mastered the essence of Tai Chi Quan, so he can lead learners to high levels of practising. To follow Scott into Tai Chi, no matter what level, is an enjoyable learning experience. Starting from the first few minutes, good feelings are brought up by watching him doing it and confidence is built up by doing with him. The result is guaranteed. A beautiful example he has set for Tai Chi exponents."
3,lcd design flaw,"great pics, easy to use, overall great camera but...as other reviewers wrote, my LCD broke. I put it in the case which is designed for the camera and placed the camera with the LCD side facing out (never thought about it) this puts the snap right on the LCD screen. placed the camera in my handbag and leaned back. the snap pressed on the LCD and broke the camera. I can still take pics but can't see if they look good and can't see what setting the camera is on. wrote to Minolta and have not gotten a response. would I buy another one? probably cause the price was reasonable and pics good but mad at minolta."
2,Nice camera but very FRAGILE,"The Dimage x50 looked to be everything I wanted in a digital camera; compact-fit in my pocket, quick-snappy startup, nice picture quality-5 mega pixels, etc. I WAS very pleased with my purchase - until I dropped the camera.I simply fumbled it while sliding it in my front pants pocket. The camera fell no more than couple feet. But, that was the end of it. The screen went completely white and never recovered. I sent it to Minolta for warranty repair. They wanted to charge me $140 for ""impact damage"". I explained to them that I felt that a $300 camera should be able to handle a short drop without total system failure. They didn't agree.I would NOT recommend this camera. It design is too fragile."
4,Great buy,"Great picture quality, very good price, easy to use and operate, takes regular SD cards and has a good battery life."
1,6 Months and Screen Already Broken,"I bought this camera and within 6 months the screen broke. I would not recommend buying this camera, the company does not have a warranty and there is nothing to do once it is broken."
3,Takes great pictures but don't drop it,"I purchased this camera barely a month ago. It is easy to use and takes great pictures. But, it was accidently dropped the other day and the LCD screen broke. I realize cameras aren't meant to be dropped but it happens. I am disappointed in how easily the screen's crystal broke. I am wondering if this not a defect due to the compact size."
2,great pictures but it broke the next day!!! so so so mad!!!!!!!!,hi its me agin i got this camera because i got great grade i had a b in math c in pe [im fat] a in science a in english a in world cultures and an a in filipino that rounds up to a 3.5 gpa back to my camera it broke the next day i cried i used it only one day but it dose have great pictures my friends said that it was cool and when i told then that it broke they were sad so thats why im getting thr sony cyber-shot t7 for my b day!! but im still mad i do not like konica minolta!:{:<
4,After a few months of use...,"We like this printer using USB & W98SE. It is my first printer going outside of the HP models. After putting in second cartridges for both color and black, I'm beginning to have mixed feelings, because we are getting streaks and smudges in both black and color? Don't know why, but am looking forward to the third cartridges to see if it goes away. Maybe it is just two bad carts. I have done cartridge testing, aligning and cleaning. We'll see... don't let this change your mind, just keep it in mind for future reference. Other longer time users should review the Z51 if this is also their problem. RON in CA"
1,Forget It!,"I owned a Lexmark before upgrading to the Z51. I loved my Lexmark. It was reliable, never crashed, gave good quality. Woe is the day I decided to upgrade to the Z51. When trying to print long documents or complex graphics projects, it simply stops then crashes the system. When trying to cancel a print job, it crashes the system. It gives bogus messages about the printer being off-line. I have called Lexmark technical support three times and while their staff was very pleasant, none of them gave me any information that helped. I reinstalled drivers, changed settings at their direction and still it crashes. The last straw occurred today while I was frantically trying to finish a project for a friend's 80th birthday. Sure enough it crashed the system. There are so many problems with this printer that it ought to be withdrawn from the market. I feel as though I threw away my money. I paid a lot less for my old Lexmark and it did a much better job."
1,Save yourself a headache,"First the good point: Print quality is fine.Otherwise, this printer is a disaster. If you're not willing to spend an extra $30 for an IEEE 1284 cable (not suggested in the Lexmark manual) it will hardly run at all. I couldn't cancel print jobs before I got one, either through the pop-up monitor or the spooling monitor.It constantly detects a cartridge change where none has taken place, then crashes the system.The driver that comes with it won't run it on either of my computers--you must get the upgrade.All-in-all, a very unpleasant experience."
2,Also had driver and USB problems,"This printer made a bad first impression on me. First off, I inserted the CD, and my computer (Dell Pentium III 450 with DVD drive) was unable to read it. I had to download the driver from the web. However, even after installing the driver, I had to look in the appendix of the (so-called) User's Manual to try to set up the USB connection. After following Lexmark's instructions, the printer would not support USB. I, too, had to go back to the parallel connection.After finally getting this thing up and running, I found the text quality to be very good, and photo quality (with optional photo cartridge) to be good, not great. I also found that the Z51 REALLY grabs the paper out of the automatic paper feeder. My paper shredder treats paper more gently. I also found it difficult to avoid skew misalignments with this printer.Shop around. There have to be better printers out there for the same price."
5,Why the heck would you pay more?,"Don't buy those overpriced brick-and-mortar HDMI cables, pick these up at a fraction of the cost and it worked just as well. Unless you are some freak audiophile or videophile, you won't notice any difference. If you want to waste your money buy the other ones, if you want to be smart by these."
1,DON'T BUY!,This Cable worked for about 10 minutes. Spend $8 or $10 and get a nice one that works from Newegg.
5,Awesome cable,"I'm using this cable to hook up a Sony DVPNS75H Single Disc Upscaling DVD Player to a Samsung 42"" plasma and the picture is flawless. Don't waste your money on an expensive cable!!!"
5,Great cables !,These are truly as good as the more expensive ones. I purchased them because of all the positive review comments and I'm very happy with them. My wide screen HDTV looks awesome !
5,Way better than monster,Don't wast your money on monster cables purchase this 5 star product.It also works great with my ps3.
4,"It's a digital cable, it's 6' long, black, and works","At this point everyone should know that all you get with the expensive digital cables is a more attractive cable. Given that my cables are all out of sight I wanted to get a cheap one, and this was it. The cable works just fine and is in every way what I expected it to be.I'm taking off a star for amazon's shipping: this cable arrived in a box large enough to ship 3 DVD players with matching cables and enough inflatable packing to fill two trash bags."
2,hdmi: any difference?,"These were inexpensive hdmi's compared to some. Bought 2 and returned one for a refund because it did not work well from Sony DVD player to Samsung LCD HD TV.then i bought another from Belkin at twice the money. My feeling is:HDMI cable has many delicate contacts; if one is bent or damaged, it won't perform as expected. How often will I buy a cable? Might as well go with a name brand with a Lifetime Warranty."
1,Does not work for 1080p,Very slow to ship (took a week for a 2 day ship) and then the cable did not work (connected to 1080p DVD player and monitor). Figured bad cable; got replacement (also took ages) - same problem. This cable does not work. All my other HDMI cables worked fine when connected to replace this one. I would not recommend.
5,Great Value,"The cheapest HDMI cable I could find in local stores was $49. With analog cables, it sometimes makes sense to buy more expensive cables but this is not true of HDMI cables. Paying more for an HDMI cable is throwing money away. I have purchased 4 of these Cables Unlimited cables from Amazon and they have worked flawlessly for me while saving a substantial amount of money."
2,Disapointed,I bought two of these cables. One of them failed after about a month. Good thing I bought two of them with one to serve as a spare which it turned out I needed.
1,product downscales 1080i hdmi input to 480p and loses audio,I tried this with both a cable box hdmi output and a dvd hdmi neither of them had any audio once they went through the switch. When either output was hooked directly to the hdmi input on my TV the signal was 1080i and the audio was there.
1,Cables Unlimited 6FT HDmi Cable,"After connecting the a digital cable receiver to my HDTV, the signal was much worse than using component cables.BEWARE!!!Purchased a more expensive HDMI cable from Best Buy that works great...."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"Having just purchased a LCD HD TV, and spending a ton of money on the TV itself, I was not thrilled in spending more money on a bunch of cables. When I found these, I couldn't believe the price, after seeing so many HDMI cables at exorbinate prices. So I tried them, and after hoping they would work as I had hoped and read in reviews they would, NOTHING, no signal, weak signal, blank screen.So I called up Dell and ordered some very expensive Belkin HDMI cables and will see if they work.. (They better for that price or they go back)I am highly disappointed but like my father always told me (didn't take his advice this time)YOU ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, and he is right.Please, please don't waste your hard earned money for junk, because that is what this cable is, JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Looks like they were home made.Now I am off to buying some optical cables. Any suggestions?"
1,You get what you pay for,I believe that you get what you pay for. The quality of this item is questionable. Is it worth connecting a very expensive HD LCD TV with a poorly constructed HDMI cable. I think not. We returned the item and went to radio shack. We payed the big bucks but it works great.
1,I Was Expecting.......WOW!,"I have a satellite network (HD Dish) and was encouraged by the Dish tech guy that an HDMI cable would enhance my reception of my satellite reception to my new Sharp 1080p 42"" Aquos TV. I did some homework here and came to the conclusion that the costlier cables were not really better because they are all digital. So I purchased these cables and did not notice any difference at all. In fact the regular cables seem a little better but I still can't tell the difference. I had to try it and not sorry I did. Now I know. I'm not bitter at Cables Unlimited but if they offered to take them back, I would send them back. Monster cables better? I'm not going to try them!"
1,Disappointed,"The vendor mislabeled our address on the shipping package causing the item to arrive five days late. By then I had already purchased the cables locally to hook up my new TV. The company had no phone number to call, just on-line help. And they were no help."
2,"Cheap cable same Picture Quality, Less durability in this case.","You're not going to get a better picture spending more for an HDMI cable. However, if you buy a cheap cable, you're more likely to get one that'll break easily. That is exactly what happened to one of these cables I bought. The connector on one end of the cable broke the first day I got it as I plugged it in a jack a couple times while setting up my home theater system. (Fortunately I should be able to get a full refund from Amazon).I would recommend the Impact Acoustics cable over this one. It may be a couple bucks more, but it feels much more sturdy."
4,hdmi cables,The cables are fine. Work as designed. However... I had to pretty much order them in the dark as they were described only as HDMI cables including the length. There are many diffrerent types of HDMI cables on the market which are designed for different technologies. It would have been very helpful to have had a item specification list for each of these cable models.Cables To Go - 40315 - 2M (6.5ft) Velocity HDMI Digital Video Cable (Blue)
4,Cables work great but fit very loosely,I bought 2 of these cables after reading reviews here and I agree that they work great and also that they fit very loosely. I can't compare this cable with the much more expensive Monster cable (~$80) but the picture and sound I get when watching HD-DVDs played on my new Toshiba HD-A20 HD DVD player and new Sony Bravia KDL-40V3000 HD 1080p LCD TV is awesome! I also had Comcast upgrade my service to HD and they installed a DCH3200 set top box. The HDMI cable connection to all three HD devices is loose but the cables haven't fallen out or anything in the 4 weeks that they've been in service. I'm happy with the cables and wouldn't hesitate to buy another one if I needed it. I would recommend this cable to anyone wishing to save a little cash over the cost of the much more expensive Monster cables ($13.50 ea vs ~$80 ea).
4,Does the Job,"This cable works as well as the $100 one. No problems HDTV looks great, no clutter with multiple cables, one does it all."
4,Only one flaw...,"This cable works fine.In my setup, it connects my upconvert dvd player to my tv. Works fine. Signal is good, picture and sound are fine.Only flaw, as a previous reviewer noted, is that the connection is not tight. Plenty of wiggle, would fall out if nudged. But at this price, it's acceptable."
5,HDMI Cable,Recieved cable quickly. Works great connecting my laptop to my plasma TV. The cord diameter is larger than the picture so I believe it has good shielding.
5,a cable is a cable,"Just buy it!!!! If your are looking for inexpensive, good quality cable, this is it. Cant beat the price, serve their purpose."
5,Works as expected!,Works well with my DVD player with upscaling to 1080i. No red streaks as reported some other reviews. Two thumbs up for bang for buck
1,Handshake Fails,This cable is definitely defective. My BluRay player and TiVo both require HDMI handshaking before they will play protected material. My other HDMI cables work fine. When I swap this one for another everything stops! I really don't know precisely how it fails but both TiVo and my Panasonic BD65 refuse to work with this cable -- and only this cable.
1,Problem with connector,"The cable failed due to the connector on one end no longer fitting tight enough into my DVD player. In fairness, I did plug and unplug the thing a couple dozen times before it stopped working and it did work great at first. I'm a big fan of cheap HDMI cables and have used several without problems so I'll just chalk this up to experience. I'm still $$$$ ahead of the game. However, I would suggest you think twice before going cheap if you are putting your cable in the wall. Its going to take me an hour or so take the TV down, move furniture, etc to switch out this bad cable which is making the few bucks I saved not seem worth it. I'd buy this again for an exposed cable since you can get 3 or 4 of them and still be ahead of getting one high priced cable but going forward I'm going to buy name brand if the cable is going in the wall."
1,"Great Price , Horrible Quality","This cable definetly comes up short in comparison to higher end cables or even the free component cables i recieved from the cable company. My component cables looked so much cleaner and brighther. This HDMI cable affected The colors greatly, leaving them dull and washed out. As for the image quality, it suffered greatly in comparison. The Cable looked noticably worse on a 23 inch lcd and my god the horrer i accounted on a 40 inch. Do your self a favor and avoid this cable. I dont know if its the price butdefinetly shop around for bargain cables"
1,They break easily,"Price was tempting, but I pushed my DVD player in a bit too hard and the end broke right off this cable...pay a few bucks more and get something better."
3,hdmi,To be honest I did not see great quality with this cable. My HD cable hookup looks much clearer than with this hdmi cable.
1,Wont play 1080p on xbox 360 with this cable,I bought this cable and i pluged it in and my xbox 360 doesnt even go to the 1080p option it just stays in the 1080i. So i went back on amazon and bought te monster 1000 ultra high speed cable for $70 and hey my 360 went to 1080p these cables are garbage dont let the price fool you!!
1,Awful quality,"After connecting the a digital cable receiver to my HDTV, the signal was much worse than using component cables.AVOID!!!"
2,Not what I expect,"Ok, I know, it is just a cable but, that's the problem, the cable quality is no what I expect. I experienced some problems with my TV/DVD Upscaler connection and I thought was related to them instead of the cable but..."
1,Cables,Cables did not work with either TVs. I guess this is why they are cheap. Did not bother returning.
3,"Good picture, great price, my bad.","This cable broke after I jerked it out of the TV by accident. Fortunately I had bought three of them because they were so cheap, two months later and no problems. Picture looks great!"
3,It does the job,The cable is a great length and gets the job done. The only issue with it is that the cable is a bit thin which could fail later on but hasn't yet and it gets used heavily.
1,"Poor quality, does not work","Bought this cable to connect from outlet to my laptop, the old one was a bit too short. Outlet connects (inside the wall) to a TV set. Everything was working great before using this cable. As soon as the new cable (this one) was plugged in, the TV set started acting up: half the image sort of clear, the lower half was just visual static, plus the static sound coming off the TV. Manufacturing defect, I guess - just an unpleasant surprise. Returned it right away."
5,Transformer,"simple simplicity. That's all. Plug & play. Transmits an excellent picture and sound, quickly and effeciently. I'm purchasing another for my satellite receiver."
2,Not Good Enough,"Purchased two of these cables to use with my new PS3 and 1080p TV. The first cable wouldn't lock in the 1080p signal at all -- the TV would flash that it detected 1080P, then go dark, then repeat. 720p and 1080i seemed to work fine.Next I tried the second cable and things seemed to be OK at 1080p... but then I noticed a faint static snow that comes and goes along with a slight flicker. Again, if I switch to 720p or 1080i things seem to be OK. I am assuming that these are Category I cables, and that is why they are causing problems.If you just need 720p or 1080i these should work fine, but if you want to run 1080p, I would look elsewhere for cables that explicitly state that they are Category II. There are plenty of them on Amazon for similar amounts."
5,The right cable for the right price.,"Don't spend severty-five dollars at a box store when you can get the same thing overnighted from Amazon for a fraction of the price. HDMI is a digital signal, so paying for custom coating on the connectors just isn't worth it.If you're reading this, you should stop waiting and just buy this cable if it's something you need. You're NOT going to find a better deal at a brick-and-mortar store. Trust me, I looked."
5,"Good Product,Great Price",Cable works great at half the price of the chain stores.I use this with PS3.
4,Great Deal,"I ordered this cable online, then I decided to shop around offline, because I was too excited to use my Toshiba HD A3 player. I was put off by the store prices, I couldn't find a cable for $20 let alone $13! All the cables I found were retailing for $70 to $100. This cable was a great deal, the PQ was amazing, and the cable is very durable. At first I was worried about the build quality but I couldn't tell the difference between this cable and the one selling for $70 at Radioshack. I'm glad I waited, because it was delivered to me the day after thanksgiving, so the wait was pretty short (around 3 to 4 days). Hope this helps."
5,Excellent Cable,"Wake up people: don't even think of spending big $ on HDMI cables. Companies like Monster Cable have been scamming consumers since HDMI first came out. I was even stupid enough to pay $160 for a 20ft HDMI cable back when there weren't any other options. THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE between this cable and a Monster cable, NO DIFFERENCE! But this one and you will be stoked with the performance."
1,1 of 2 cables didn't work,"When I installed my HDTVs one cable didn't work, but the other one did. Had to send it back to Amazon and get a replacement, which was very prompt and convenient. I hope a 50% failure rate isn't typical."
3,Good enough for the price,"The connectors seem a bit loose, meaning the male to female connection seems to slip off too easily.However, the quality of video/audio feed is comparable to other, more expensive, HDMI connectors I am using."
5,Lenght,The cable is absolutely great i just didnt realize 6ft is a smaller cable then i expected lol it is very small! But great quality HD and good overall cable highly recommend the buy to every1 else i think i even pointed a few friends in your direction!! Shipping was very fast!
3,Ad does not clearly specify length of cables,These cables are only 3 feet long. That should be specified in the product title and description.They work fine and the price is right - there is no reason to spend big bucks on HDMI cables!
4,good price!!,Don't buy the more expensive monstercables...these do the exact same thing and work fine!
4,Good cable but...,Pro: Nice and CheapCon: Not sure if its the cable or a problem with a different component but when I play a CD on my Sony 5 Disk DVD player with this cable the audio pops. If I use standard component left/right it does not.Other Thoughts: Audio for movies is fine. The picture looks great. And flat panel TVs are not know for great audio so I did not plan on playing a lot of CDs anyway.
2,Worked for about a year,"Worked for about a year in a low stress setting - no kinking, plugged in once and never touched again. Unfortunately just gave out. Confirmed by replacing with a new HDMI cable, and trying to use this cable on other components. For the price, I guess it's what you expect."
4,Does the job,"I see no problems in picture quality. Price excellent, really can't beat it. Takes a little while to get wire uncoiled."
4,HDMI Is Great!,"How does all that pictue and sound squeeze through just one cable? Who cares! Just know that it does, and that you wont be disappointed with this inexpensive digital connection solution.Bring home a peice of the orient without leaving your computer chair - buy an HDMI cable today!Very plain design...it could have used some finger grooves instead of the flat sides as the one I received has, but it pretty much stays put. It does what it's supposed to do."
4,Great way to connect your DVD player,"Good quality, good value product. Makes connecting your HD DVD Player and TV/Monitor easy with excellent picture/sound quality."
4,Good Cable - NOT 6FT,The quality of the cable is good and item performs as described. However if you need the full 6FT this will not work. Item is about 3 inches short.
4,Don't pay 90 bucks at a big box retail shop.,"This product doesn't appear as well made as some you can find in the retail shops. However, this was a FRACTION of the cost. I unwittingly paid 80 bucks for a shorter cable, only to find how cheap I could get them online. I paid almost as much for the cable as I did for the upscaling DVD player.My inexpensive little replacement (after I took that overpriced cable back to Circus Silly) has been in place ever since, and I have no complaints."
1,Defective,My picture flashed in and out on my TV every few minutes when I hooked up this HDMI cable. I assume it's defective. I still refuse to spend $100 so I'm ordering another cheap one on Amazon in the hopes that the next one works.
1,Had problems with connections.,We were unable to get good connections with the new Samsung TV we just bought and the local cable network people that were helping us ended up using the Component cables in lieu of the HDmi cable. Amazon immediately sent us a replacement but it still didn't work out. I still am interested in using an HDmi cable but need to find out more before I change from what I am now using.
1,buyer beware,"do not buy the hdmi cord mine failed already, colors faded,spend some extra bucks and get a better cord u dont have to spend alot of money for a good cord"
2,Cable works but is loose at connections,"Cable appears to work ok so far, but is loose at connections both on the receiver and TV and is thinner than 2 other brands I have.I plan to return the cable to amazon since it's defective."
3,Not real sure.,"Most everything I've read on the internet seems to indicate that there is little or no difference in HDMI cables - whether they cost $100 or $2 - especially in the shorter lengths. I used this cable between our Dish HD receiver and our new Samsung HD TV. But there seemed to be a great deal of pixelating (is that a word?) with this cable. So I replaced it with the cable that came with our Oppo Upconverting DVD player (considerably larger size with ferrules on each end), and there seemed to be an improvement. So, based on very limited viewing, I would recommend a better cable."
5,awesome,"ATTENTION TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR HDMI CABLES!There is absolutely NO need to spend money on the ridiculously priced HDMI cables that are found in retail stores. Stay away from the ($150 +) Monster cables or anything priced over $30 for that matter. Digital cables either work or they don't. There is no in-between. Certain cable manufactures and stores (best buy) would love for you to think otherwise, but don't let yourself be suckered into that garbage. Save yourself a lot of money and go with these cables instead. They work perfectly. Spend a few dollars and do a comparison test if you want to. You will see no difference in quality between these and much more expensive cables."
3,TOO short,The cables work fine. The issue is how short they are in length. Just be careful to read the technical description to ensure you're ordering them the right length.
3,HDMI,For the price. There worth the money. The picture's great. I don't have an expensive set of HDMI Cables to compare video quality with. But I'd buy these all the time if need be.
5,Son-In-Law loved the book,"Not ever having heard of him myself, I saw an interview on an old Johnny Carson show and knew my son-in-law would enjoy reading Fatso.Fatso: Football When Men Were Really Men"
2,Not what I expected.,"I expected to get this book and not be able to put it down until I'd read it cover to cover. However, after the first 20 or so pages, I was very disappointed. The writing left alot to be desired on most of the stories. There was no real thread to connect the stories, even though the stories had been put into chapters that were basically titled by the content of the stories, but sometimes the stories didn't fit the category they were put into. That being said, there were some high points to the book. For example, there is a story about four WWE superstars traveling from North Carolina to Tennessee and having a wreck on the way. It may not sound (in description here) like it would be that funny, but the way it is told (apparently by Shannon Moore), the story is so hilarious that you feel almost as if you are listening to him personally tell you the story and the descriptive writing makes you feel as if you were right there when the event took place."
3,"Are we laughing yet, no, almost.","This was an enjoyable read, although expected it to be funnier. There are some good stories, but, most are more serious than I expected. I was surprised that so many of the superstars that have moved on from the territory are included, ie. Rico, Christian, etc. Still it is okay for the casual WWE fan."
4,"Good, Quick, Funny Read","This is a good, quick and funny read with a collection of road stories and behind the scenes humor from pro wrestling's greatest characters."
4,You see the real Peter,"I was very impressed with this book. Good scholarship,in depth thinking but at the same time it made Peter seem like a real person, with lots of the authors own experinces (or other people he knew) included. I was disappointed that there was not more material included on Pentecost and the remarkable sermon Peter preached after Pentecost. Other wise, a great book!"
5,2nd favorite Christmas film,"I first saw this on TV about 4 or 5 years ago, around Christmas. I finally found it on video this year. This is 2nd only to ""A Christmas Carol"" as my favorite holiday film."
2,Not a Feel-Good Movie,"The main character had no Christmas spirit, but tried to find joy. His girlfriend had broken up with him and got mad at him for sending her a gift. He is shown walking the city looking for joy and things to do. He runs into a few people who try to cheer him up. For me this movie was dragging on with boring characters. It may have had a decent ending with him getting back with his girlfriend and going home for Christmas, but those were just brief showings, nothing to hold unto. I watched about 15 Christmas movies through November and December and this movie was the most boring and un-interesting."
1,The Night Before Christmas,"I love watching Christmas movies, but I must say....this is the worst movie I think I have ever watched. It was only 45 minutes long. It just had a wierd story line. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. And for the price I paid, it made it even worse!"
4,Nice Holiday Movie,"This movie has a great Chicago ""feeling"" to it. In fact, my favorite parts throughout the film are the shots in and around the Windy City.Most everyone can empathize with the main character and his tribulations on Christmas Eve. The theme of unrequited love during the holiday season is especially poignant.Be warned that the production values are kind of poor (sound and picture are more reminiscent of VHS than DVD). To me this was a forgivable shortcoming, only adding to the independent feel of the movie and ensemble cast of relative unknowns.One of those rare movies without any bad language or violence that the entire family can enjoy!"
5,We can all relate to this...,"While watching this film, I found that I could relate to the main characer, Nick, very well. I'm sure most people can relate to being down at Christmas, or at least a particular Christmas. This film shows us that sometimes it's just the small things, the brief encounters that can lift our spirits and remind us of the joy of this holiday."
1,The night before christmas,So Sorry but I hated it very boring and slow....Wish I could sell it back
2,Watch for the ripp off,"I just need to let fans of Steel Pulse know that there is one difference between Live From The Archives and Live Legends...the latter does not have on Klu Klux Klan.I bought The Archives as it came out.. saw Legends come out months later, researched it and it seemed to be a different concert as the song selection was much better. On viewing the product it was exact same show. I know the strenght of the band's live performamces and was hoping Live Legends was a much better show."
2,What to expect,"I love steel pulse. Their music mastery is terrific, however in this DVD you really don't get the feel of the music. It takes a couple of minutes to recognize the song they are perfoming which takes away all the pleasure of enjoying familiar tunes perfomed live. There is zero bass and if you are a true reggae fan you probably know the need for that German Bass. No Menus are available either or even just some extra info on Steel Pulse. The picture quality is perfect. All in all the fault is with the sound technicians and not the band."
2,not the crucial version,"this is not steel pulse at its finest. too poppy,to clean.you dont get the street roots sound of this band. and whats up with that crappy 80's snare drum sound? there has to be some hard ass footage of this band somewhere..and they put this out? where is da justice?"
1,Should have listened to the other bad reviews.,"Frankly I don't know how the science in this book is. I Couldn't get to it.I'd read the other reviews that said 'too much political garbage', but never imagined that a book on the SCIENCE of alcohol as a fuel would waste page after page after page with political cartoons, not about alcohol as a fuel, but just bashing particular politicians that the author doesn't like. He's lost all credibility in MY book, and HIS book is being returned.Glad amazon has liberal return policy, so to speak."
2,Too much information,"THis book was purchased on the recommendation of a talk radio guest. The only thing I can say is it was long, full of information, and somewhat boring. You might say it was overkill. For a casual, general reader it was way too much information and not an easy read."
3,Wish it could really happen!!,"This book has a lot of food for thought(and gas). I truly wish it could happen because we could be free of foreign oil dependence, use our own and nature's waste for fuel! The logistics could be done but the entrenchment of oil companies would never allow it. Very thought provoking with facts or data I had never heard of before, but it makes sense. Wish Henry Ford were here to fight again for the better way!"
5,This books helps strip away the myths of history.,"This book delves into the kind of information that could help us avoid making the same mistakes over and over. If it can help create awareness of how susceptible the public is to being flim-flammed by the Oil Industry experts and its sycophants imbedded throughout the government and media we could clean this mess up. The book shows that it was the oil interests who politicized energy not the author of this book.Contrary to the specious complaints of some, this book doesn't pretend to be a highly technical treatise on large scale alcohol production out of fruit... which is plain from a quick look at the table of contents. There are a few paragraphs or pages at most on each of a dozen areas. It's not a substitute for a degree in chemistry or manufacturing...but it does show that it can be done with the investment of some resources ...good grief"
2,Too Much Propaganda!,"This would be a good book if it was kept strictly scientific, but on allmost every page there is some global warming, anti Republican, Anti Oil posters. This is a huge book and is very expenisve. If he cut out all the crap it would be half the size and half the cost. Gas is $5 it would be nice to make my own, this book needs an update."
2,Heavy on Political Agenda,I am disappointed that the Author felt the need to promote his agenda in the pages of what I thought was intended to be a technical book. He didn't bother to give facts or references to back up his clearly illogical and biased statements. The first few pages of this drivel made him loose all credibility with me.
5,great book,this book has petty much everthing you need on this in one place . pictures and drawings of most of the things you need places to get more .
4,Overly Optimistic,"Good book with a lot of great information. Blume is overly optimistic because independent ethanol production is near impossible to produce, store & sell in some states due to regulations and time to obtain permits can take years."
2,Album doesn't really go anywhere,"Props to this outfit for throwing in thrashy techno drums, but the songs don't really progress beyond their basic riffs. I suppose this is fine if you're more a fan of punk rock or hardcore than metal, but I was hoping for more depth to the music or at least a catchy tempo. If you're looking for industrial metal, do yourself a favor and check out bands like The Kovenant, Deathstars, Pain, and Gothminister. They showcase much more skill in songwriting while capturing the essence of pure hard gothic sound."
1,Skidbuster is a bust,"Yes it does stop you from falling, and yes it does ""look"" comfortable however upon wearing them i discovered that they did not trim a seam on the inside all the way it then proceeded to give me blisters. Save yourself some trouble and just go to Shoes For Crews and you will never be disappointed ."
1,Lack of substance or new ideas in this book,"This book is honest in stating that it is just common sense. It is, unfortunately, a boring account of the author bragging about his accomplishments. I bought it thinking it was a serious consideration of the topic of leadership and was sorely disappointed."
4,History of time,"This book is a good history of time. My first real book on cosmology. Since then, there have been many other discoveries in the field that make our understanding of things slightly different. Still this is a really good first book at understanding cosmology. They're just a little too worried that readers won't understand it if they add something a little technical. It becomes a book good only for those who will never grasp anything more, or a first book for those who will graduate to more descriptive, technical books."
3,Not as impressed as I'd hoped,I really enjoyed certain parts of the book. I enjoyed the descriptions of relativity and some of the history and tests behind some of the different theorems. The diagrams help make some things easier to understand. Just don't expect to really understand the universe or the meaning of life or even gravity for that matter after reading this. Haha. It really just kind of shows how little we really know.
1,A Brief History of Time and A Long History of Stephen Hawking going on and on about his life,I would give this book 1 and 1/2 stars if Stephen Hawking would not interrupt the physics with endless stories of what he said to this and that person that he believes was very clever. This author keeps needing to prove that he is clever every few pages and it gets to be distracting. Stephen Hawking is no Richard Feynman. When will a real teacher write a book on astrophysics?
2,diminishing returns,The gains from reading this book are directly proportional to the amount of pictures in it since the quality of the writing is consistently mediocre;one passes the event horizon around page 100.
3,wow this book is really out,I bought this book because of the reviews. I am a nut when it comes to reviews. I didn't really like the book. It's a little too out there if you know what I mean. A little too sci-fi. I only got half way and maybe in the future I will give it a try again. It was a little hard to understand because of the way it was written. You have to have a degree in physics to understand. Not for your average Joe.
3,good book.,"unfortunately, for me the the knowledge it contain was written in other books some 5000 years ago. however that was a very crude knowledge, the book is more scientific."
4,Good Book to Expand your Science Knowledge,I enjoyed reading this book as it is well written and the illustrations are a nice touch to help get the point across.
4,Get over it when there is no time,"From past to current, from simple kinetics to quantum theory, this book introduces ideas gradually. A well-organized review book that will widen many eyes."
5,Great Introduction to Modern Physics,"Not only is Stephen Hawking a brilliant theoretical physicist, he'salso a wonderful and easily-understood science writer, as this bookshows. The well-executed and informative graphics help to explainthe material, as well as visually breaking up the pages intosmaller, more digestible pieces. The text is an excellent mix oftheory, history, and personal anecdotes. If you've ever found physicsinteresting but a bit too complicated, this would be a great bookto cut your metaphorical scientific teeth on."
5,An excellent book in times to come.,There are only a few good book who have treated subjects of cosmology and astronomy in so detail and curious way. This is one of them. It is both philosophical and scientific. It will send you into various loops of thought once you read it. I found it very exciting and almost spend days and weeks to think about several concepts it talked about.
5,good stuff,"works great- tops work fine, mine are flat enough. great for refrig. and microwave. i got 2 five cup containers and 2 two cup. all are good, i recommend."
4,Love the classics!,"I must admit that I bought this cd strictly for the Hernando's Hideaway song, but found other jewels on the album. I am happy that I have this in my collection."
5,a completely unforgettable read.,"I read this book in 6th grade and have never forgotten it. The settings, characters, battles were were so vivid that I can remember many parts as though I read them yesterday. I can hardly wait to read it again and share it with my family and friends. I really cannot say enough about this book."
2,Maddening sizing problem leads to Christmas disappointment,"The sizes were described as ""Kids."" Our girls wear 4.5, and so we ordered size 5. Okey dokey? Not.The Heely's arrived and when I opened the box, they looked awfully small. Upon inspection, the box AND the label said ""WO's 5, Youth 4.""I don't know what ""WO's"" is (Women's?) but we were sold a size 4 Heely, and without enough time to exchange before Christmas."
3,eh,My daughter really likes these shoes. To me they make about as much sense as throwing marbles on the floor and then trying to walk across it.
5,Wine savers,Buy this with the concerto pump from vacu vin. I love the click noise it makes when you get to the right pressure! I have been using for a few weeks now and my wine lasts longer and I can have more bottles open at a time without worry of spoiling.
4,Great single for a great song,"This single is excellent overall. I give it four stars because Powderfinger show off their wonderful knack for crafting the best b-sides on the planet, but it's minus the star because I don't know how to give it 4.5 and because they made it a double-A side which isn't very cool. They are the best b-sides band that I know of and I love singles. ""Nature Boy"" is a well-done piece with a guitar line that is worthy enough to note. Overall, probably the tune that could've substituted for ""Like a Dog"" on the album and is the bonus track on the Japanese version.""Odyssey #1 (demo)"" is one of the best Powderfinger b-sides they have ever done. Absolutely rocking. The opening is magnificent, great guitar line submitted here and the acoustic accompanment gets me every time. The swirl of sounds to the final rock out is BRILLIANT. Not to mention the lyrics and vocals (Bernard sounds like he's got a cold). Listen up."
5,Grits at their best,"This is hands down the best album GRITS has put out. It's the closest to mainstream hip-hop they have ever been as far as production, style and flow go. The lyrics are incredible and the abum jells nicely. My only complaint is that I personally thought the albumn had too many tracks with a 'dirty south' sound (I prefer more of an eastcoast style-but this is just my personal preference). Of course they are from the south, so I guess you can't really expect anything different. But overall this album is a winner (and not just on a christian hip-hop scale). I really don't know how they plan on topping it when Dichotomy B drops in the fall. If you like GRITS and/or if you like hip-hop, get this album - you'll find what you're lookin for."
5,Great CD,This is an awesome CD. It saddens me to say it's even better than Art of Translation. Bobbin' Bouncin' is essentially a Here WE Go part 2 and both Higher and Anybody should and will be classics.
5,Christian hip -hop that rocks,grits is one of the greatest christian rappers. I finally found rappers with good lyrics. it has good beats and everything. my favs are are practically every song. THIS IS A MUST BUY.
3,"It was alright, Nothing special though: ***1/2","From what i heard on this album, The grits are a talented christian rap duo. There are a few boring songs on here, But for the most part, There are enough interesting songs on here. The best songs are ''Anybody'' [The best song on here], ''Gutter boy'', ''High'', And ''Hittin curves''. Some of the beats aren't too good, But the lyrics are quite decent [Especially the ones by coffee]. Christian rap fans should be satisfied by this album. It's not one of the best christian rap albums out there, But it's 1 christian rap album that's worth at least 1 listen. Hope the review helped you. Be blessed."
3,It's a hoot!,"The slide whistles were a hit on New Year's day. These were given as prizes at our annual New Year's bingo games. They also make a great addition to the kids's ""marching band""."
4,Product Evaluation,"I received the product. Every specification about the product you put on the list in order to buy it was ok, and I could check it when the product arrived.Thanks."
2,"Review of ""Only A Star""","This is a beautiful written and illustrated book. It shows a new perspective on that special night. I love the simplistic view the author took on Christmas: how nature provided it's own decorations for Christ's birth. While it is not particularly for toddlers, I would highly recommend it to children and adults."
2,Only a Star (Facklam) 0-8028-5174-6,"This book was OK but not one I would recommend to be read with preschoolers in a school or church setting. There were too many ""what if's"" that took away from nativity story. Perhaps these things happened; maybe they didn't. But there was no mention of why this night or this baby was so special to mankind."
2,"Great Album, not so great sound","This is a great collection from a great artist, but the sound is very sub par. I would recommend the complete mythology, even the itunes version sounds wonderful. There is no instrument or vocal panning on any of these as the originals were, like they took a stereo recording and made it mono. I personally will be getting the mythology set on vinyl and cd, but I've previewed the itunes version and it is excellent also, nice clean sound, panning is there. Spend the extra money on a collection done right with the original sound."
5,Cleaning for the DW,"This stuff works great at keeping your diswasher clean and free of soap and gunk build up. The washer works better when you keep it clean and drains and traps stay free of soap / gunk build up, Recommend using this product every other month."
4,Decent enough job - has an odor of it's own that takes a few washes to get out.,"My washer wasn't overly dirty, but I did have a little bit of a musty smell that this product seemed to clear up nicely. I'm assuming it was a mix of old detergent and just plain New England humidity.That said - it took 5 full cycle hot/hot washes to get the smell of Washer Magic out of my washing machine, even with detergent and bleach in the (empty) loads. After the first cycle it was VERY strong smelling, and I definitely didn't want to wash my clothes in the machine. So keep in mind that you'll need to run several cycles to get the smell of WM out of your machine, but once it's gone - so far so good. I'd buy this again."
3,Mediocre performance,"This stuff definitely helped clean the washing machine tub, but probably only eliminated 50% of the dirt and did nothing for the odor. At $6 per use, I'm not going to try several bottles. I ended up running a couple cycles on hot with bleach and it worked much better."
2,Boo! NO MAPS!,"I bought a few guide books to plan a trip to Seattle, the city of my birth. With only a few days to spend, The title attracted me because it is the TEN BEST THINGS to do.225 pages on TEN THINGS?NO MAPS - all landmarks are the same print color, events tend to blend into one another. Also the book is large, not an easy fit into the purse.I recommend Access Seattle, which is a great guide full of easy to read maps, wonderful reviews and an easy to read lay out! Also gives you clues into festivals different times of the year. Not to mention, a good size to fit into a bag.I gave it two stars because the book is rich in history. So, it is an interesting read, but I would not plan a vacation around it."
5,An excellentsource of information.,This book is very enlightening. I never knew there were so many ways to have my identity stolen. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
3,Deceptive advertising?,"Identity TheftIt is important to have the latest information with this type of material. Amazon's product details section states this book was published by Career Press in 2008. However, when you use the ""Look Inside"" functionality offered by Amazon, you'll notice that the copyright and other dates printed in the book are from 2002-3. Other reviews of this book on Amazon are from those years too. There is a big difference between 2002 and 2008, so buyer beware.(I am giving the book ""neutral"" 3 stars rating since I don't want to skew the rating system, just point out the problem. After all, the book would most likely have been a very good read in 2002.)"
2,Unreal!,"The things in this book are unreal and would NEVER happen. Just because the book is fiction doesn't mean that they couldn't add some reality to it. I mean come on! Somebody puts red paint in her lunch bag, like they wouldn't get caught. And the fact that she actually goes thruogh with the party is something we all know would never happen, any level-headed person would cancel a little party if their life became in danger."
2,Boring,This book revoles around a murder that happened in the Fear steet woods a year ago.Someone shot and killed Evan.Yet no one knows for sure just who did it.Ellen a girl who followed Evan that fateful night left soon after the murder happened.Shannon Evan's sister and his friends haven't been the same since he died.Now Ellen's coming back to Fear Steet for a visit.Meg wants to throw her a Surprise Party to show how much they missed her.Yet it seems not everyone misses Ellen.Cause someone starts sending threatening messages saying Don't have the Surprise Party.Yet Meg won't let herself be bullied into canceling the party.Even though her friends tell her she should.Maybe she should have listened cause things are about to get worst.
5,One of Fear Street's Best!,"The Surprise Party is probably one of the best books in the whole Fear Street series. It is funny, scary, suspenseful, and has a great storyline. It is about a girl named Meg that throws a surprise party for Ellen, her old bestfriend, because she is coming to visit. But then Meg receives phone calls telling her to cancel the party or else. Then the party invitations get cut up. Then comes the note in her locker and then the red paint thats supposed to be blood in her lunch bag. Could it be that Ellen is coming to town? Is it just a prank? Or does it have something to do with the murder of Evan a year ago? Meg must find out. This book is really fabulous. I am certain that every pre- teen will love this book as much as I did. Read it sonn or you'll be mad you didn't. Remember, you're in for a scare!!!"
2,Predictable!,"Not great. It is better than some I have seen, but still...not great!Very Predictable, almost like a home movie don't really badly!"
1,Embarrassingly bad,"I rented this movie for, I think, $3.00, and rarely have I ever felt as if I've wasted money so shamefully as I did with this movie. I should have just lit three singles on fire.This paranormal investigator movie was under-produced, overacted, shockingly underdeveloped and horribly written. The plot had potential until the actors opened their mouthes and the dialogue came out.There are some amazing movies on the paranormal. This is not one of them. The only scary thing about this whole mess is that someone produced it and Amazon agreed to put it onto their website for sale."
1,Can I give zero stars please?,"I'm 53 minutes into this and I wish I could get a refund for the dollar I paid to rent it. This is literally a bunch of friends have some video cameras and there is no script. There are more awkward pauses, ""um's"" and insincere ""acting"" (I use that term loosely) than I've seen in videos I made with my friends in 7th grade. They claim if you love those lame ghost shows on TV, you'll love this. Uhh...no. I'm serious when I say it's like your neighbors came over and said ""hey, we've smoked a little homegrown, wanna make a ghosty movie?"" and you reply ""I have no acting experience"" and they say ""neither do we."" Okay, it just ended and we looked at each other with no words adequate to describe the pile of dung we just wasted our lives on. Rent at your own risk because I'm pretty sure the only people who bought this are the relatives of the people in the movie."
2,Good product if its not broken,overall this product was good and the only problem I have with it is it was delivered with half the water missing from the aquarium part at the bottom so the fish doesnt float and it doesnt make the bubbles it should. have to exchange for another one.
5,Soothing,We have a 3 mth. old grandson and at this age he is very hard to buy for. He enjoys watching and listing to everything. I am sure he will love this.
4,Watched 5 times in one week when I was a kid. . .,"Classic a-bomb ""what will you do when"" flick. Back in the '60's in L.A. - channel 5 would run the same movie at the same time all week long. My brothers and I watched this one every single night and never got tired of it. I hope it is re-released, I'd love to own it."
4,Panic in the year zero,I thought the movie was very good! I just love Ray Milland.it makes you wonder what you would do in a situation like that
2,cheap cheap cheap..........,cheap cheap cheap..........VERY thin would never buy again...Men's Powder Blue Dress Shirt w/ Convertible Cuffs sz 17 1/2 34/35....can't recommend!~
4,All the Characters and History,"Despite the seemingly disjointed narrative, I enjoyed this novel in its English translation. The characters that populate the book are colorful and make the Russian migrant experience in Israel come alive. Rubina writes with a ruthless compassion for her people and their situations so that I came to care for Zaima and Writer N on deep levels. She has a way of working philosophical rumination in with the story that elevates it beyond interesting anecdote. I am amazed at the smooth translation, how accessible the story became to me! I have read translations of Tolstoy and Chekhov in school that did not seem as graceful as this! Here Comes the Messiah! should be on college reading lists for students in European and Jewish Studies programs and also those doing translation and literature."
4,Good history book,"This is a good history book for those who feel a need to read up on the roots of Internet communities as we know them. The author was head of The WELL.For those who need practical advice on how to create an online community today, the book by Amy Jo Kim is more useful."
2,This book was very disappointing.,"It uses the word Hosting in the title, so I'm thinking it means Hosting, like ""Webmaster"" material. It speaks in general, non-technical terms for a day trader or something, in fact, the whole time I'm thinking ""what is the guy talking about."" Where are the details? Why aren't they talking about technologies i.e. Languages, Scripts, e-commerce engines, application servers, web servers, job price assessment.The book is very out-dated, and is written for very non-technical people, therefore does not offer anything to technical users trying to get a general (big picture) look at being an in depth webmaster/hosting engineer. I was suckered by the title and the reviews, both were very misleading.Do not waste you money. I recommend an e-business or e-commerce book.Jason"
5,Expensive for a reason,"I agree with Gary's review completely. This is the only physical chemistry book I could find that seemed like it was written for people who need help on the subject. I cannot say the same for Schaum's outline for physical chemistry. I suspect ""Instant Notes..."" is more expensive than other books because people can actually understand it. I love it."
4,Good alternative to buying batteries by the bucketfull,"Pays for itself in no-time, batteries are expensive, and this is a great alternative. It lasts good on one charge, however, it is a bit bulky, and after attaching it, the top L and R buttons can be a bit awkward to get to if you have small hands, but after a bit of time, it's possible to get used to it. Another problem is that it lacks any sort of charge indicator, so you have no idea when it's fully charged or not. It nearly doubles the size of the GBA, so it might not be very practical if you like the GBA's portability. Overall, its advantages far outweigh its disadvantages."
1,Doesn't work!,"I bought this product at a video game store, charged it up over night, and I put it in my GBA and nothing happened. I figured out that the problem was that the two metal ends weren't conneting, and I've tried everything, but I can't fix it and I can't take it back to the store. So be warned"
2,I cannot recommend this one,"Although I'm sure this book contains a lot of cogent scientific information, the story is much too brutal for my taste.I understand that the life of a handicapped person is not easy. My sister's confined to a wheelchair. However, I was put off by the cruelness and brutality that ran through the book.I cannot recommend this book to my fellow readers. It's just too bleak...especially the final scene. It haunted me for days."
4,"Intense, but I could not put it down.","I bought this book based on the ""professional"" reviews at amazon.com. I read it in 2 sittings, but I cannot heartily recommend it unless you're looking for detailed scientific information about genetics, a boring history of Gregory Mendel, a disturbing and sometimes brutal plot line, or a very unsettling ending.I wish I had quit reading right after the baby was born. I could have lived with the ending as it stood at that point. However, the final scene was just too brutal for my taste and, although I've tried, I cannot get that last image out of my mind.I'll have to let the dust settle a bit before I can pass final judgment, but, at this point, I would not advise my friends to read this book. It's just a bit too intense for my liking."
2,Put me to sleep,"For the first time in a couple years, I failed to finish a book. After about 140 pages of waiting for something to happen (or even an indication that something *might* happen later), I gave up. I tried to hang in there for the sake of the admittedly interesting science, but the story seemed to be going nowhere. I just couldn't stay awake for the last 2/3 of the book."
2,Disappointed,"I had trouble finishing this book and thought the all the pages and pages of molecular biology was contrived and boring. Some would have been fine.I also had trouble believing in or caring about Benedict Lambert.I was sorry that I believed the hype about this book that it showed that ""life is what you make out of it, not what you are born with,"" because I expected the character to be uplifting in some way.The ending made me think of the trick endings in the sci fi books I enjoyed as a kid, but no longer find satisfying."
3,"I enjoyed the book, but I'm weird like that.","I really got a kick out of reading this book, but I can't recommend it to anyone who isn't already very interested in genetics and dorky geek characters. Ben Lambert is a jerk and a letch and hung-up on self-pity and arrogance, but I loved him anyway. Gregor Mendel's story is amazing and well told, but hey the guy mostly just sits around counting peas. Not exactly a thriller, here, folks. Plot summary: ugly horny smart (and short, very short) megolomaniac studies history and contemplates his semen for several hundred pages. Gotta love it, right?"
4,An Invitingly Pedantic Tale of Feelings and Science,"I appreciated the style of this text. It flowed well and really maintained my interest. The juxtaposition between the scientists past and present was accomplished with great mastery. The love story component of the text was at times heart-wrenching and yet embarrassingly honest. It had been so long since I have read a good novel, I was elated to read such a well-written and well-concieved novel."
2,dissapointing,"Mawer presented an excellent corralation between eugenics and genetics and the novel's brutality reflects the frustration we all experience due to our inadequacies. However, I could not overcome the annoying fabrication of Gregor Mendel's emotions; nothing is more dissatisfying than the creation of a fictional character from a nonfictional scientific genious. Furthermore, I was not captivated in any way; rather, I just yearned to finish the darn thing!"
5,Very unique perspective of genetics. Great read.,"This is a great novel and a must for people interested in genetics. Very unique and thought provoking view of genetics. I would strongly recommend to anyone, particularly people involved in genetics."
5,Works Great on my Treo,Enjoying the launcher and have tried many. Looks great and has very cool integration with some other products. Have had no problems with XP installation or Treo 300 installation.
1,Got Win98? ...hope so,"Silver Screen seems like a neat product. It says NT compatible which made me think that I could use it on my Handspring Treo and my Windows 2000 PC. Unfortunately, the Silver Screen application will not install on to my handheld because, as their tech support told me, I'm not using Windows 98."
4,IT'S NOT VULGAR!,"If you miss the old type of comedy, which made you laugh your tuckus off without bad words and put-downs, you have to see this movie. Tim Conway is a genius of the old school, where you could be funny and remain a gentleman."
5,Just what he wanted,Great movie and on blu-ray even better. It was a terrific movie to watch with the family during the cold.
3,Saw it first time around,I saw this in the theatre when it first came out and it was memorably silly enough that I wanted it on DVD.
3,good humor,"Tim Conway and Don Knotts play a sort of Sherlock Holmes/Dr. Watson team. Only difference is, these two bungling oafs stumble over more clues than they locate with intelligence. They have been called out to investigate the deaths of two people at a huge estate (the movie was filmed at the famed Biltmore Estate located in Asheville NC). As they try to investigate the crime, the maid,the butler, and other folks apparently come up murdered.While is not a belly buster of a movie, it has its moments. Is it good enough to purchase? Well, I own a copy of it, and I recommend you do the same if you like comedy. It's spooky in a light sense of the word and a fairly entertaining movie with a decent plot."
3,Family-friendly fun minus the farts,"Now-days, seems you have to have flatulence, penis/boob jokes, or a semingly endless string of un-related site gags to have it qualify as a comedy/mystery.Private Eyes is a movie I would feel comfortable watching with my 65-year-old mother -- as well as my 18 and 6 year old kids. It is a funny -- ok, silly -- movie that (unlike many of the bodily-function-fests these days) actually does have a clever plot with an ending.The running gags in the movie are cute and will entertain kids. Still, as an adult I found it fun to watch, too."
5,"Hey Bret, What'd you mean ... ?","""Every ancient joke falls with a muffled thud as Knotts and Conway ham their way through the pointless story"" Unbelievable. I think that's exactly what they were going for. Your comment sounds critical, but somehow in this context it might be read as high praise.Everyone else who hasn't seen this should get it. My sister and I grew up with it and watched it so many times that we'd turn the sound off and recite it along with the show. Almost 20 years later we could probably still get through with 80%+ accuracy.Buy this, you'll like it."
4,Gone with the wind,"It was a good movie, I and my son liked it.It had a lot of laughs with twist and turns through out the movie. Tim Conway and Don Knox are two of the most funnyist guys I know.I wish the could done more movies on the same subject."
5,Even teens will laugh at this one!,"Tim Conway and Don Knots are quite a duo in this hilarious mystery. You never quite know ""who done it"" and you never can be sure about what the next rhyme won't be... However, everyone in the family can enjoy this movie. My husband and I first enjoyed this movie while dating back in the early 80's... we never forgot about it and this past year I purchased for a Christmas surprise!We have all enjoyed this movie and continue to enjoy it, in fact it is a favorite with both of my teenage daughters and they love to bring it out whenever they have friends ""hang out"".Order it today and ENJOY!"
5,welcome back boys!,"i could'nt believe my eyes, when i saw this film here i'm happy because this funny flick has'nt been in print for quite sometime. i can't wait to get my copy, don knotts & tim conway are a great comedy team together in this classic mystery spoof. i don't know why it went out of print in the first place. highly recommended! you'll be laughing your guts out. i recommended any film with knotts& conway in it, have fun."
3,WARNING ON BLU-RAY,I and a few others have had trouble with the sound not being in sync with the picture. I have contacted Hen's Tooth Video about this issue. Just letting everyone know.
5,Private Eyes DVD,Bought this for my Daughter as a Gift. It was one of her favorites when she was young and we've been looking for it for a while. Good Don Knots And Tim Conway Comedy.
4,A CLASSIC,Who but Don Knotts and Tim Conway could pull off a movie like this? It has to be one of the funniest moves ever and the whole family can watch it.
3,"5 for the movie, 1 for the company that put it on DVD","I don't know if Hensteeth (or Henstooth, or whever they are. I've never heard of them) think they're being trendy charging over $20 for a B Movie (a good B Movie, but still a B Movie), but this is way too much considering that it was not restored, has no choices of standard vs. widescreen, and has no extras (it's basically a Goodtime Video at Criterion Prices, and Amazon's prices are among the best prices). I'll hold out until Goodtime, Platinum, or Mill Creek gets the rights. Or some major studio gets the rights, and releases it for at least $10 less (and with special features)."
4,The Private Eyes,"This movie was a wonderful movie for most families. Don Knotts and Tim Conway are two of the craziest people and you put them together, anything can happen and usually does. I recommend this movie for family night."
3,Great family film....but this DVD is the pits.,"I loved this film as a kid, and if you want something to watch with the family you don't have to go any further. Great family entertainment. BUT this DVD sucks. It's a bad pan & scan, mediocre video, okay audio, and no extras. It's very expensive for such a shoddy DVD. I'd skip it for now because the rights should revert and a new version out in a year or so."
4,Classic comedy team = classic comedy film,"I remember seeing this movie with my mother when I was a kid. I also remember watching it every time it came on HBO! We laughed at the same schtick every single time!This is a great comedy movie that you wouldn't be embarassed to watch with your kids, your parents or even your grandparents.Great jokes, great physical comedy and great running gags. Don Knotts will be sorely missed, but at least we have his movies on DVD to treasure.The only reason I could not give 5 stars is beacuse the film is not in widescreen. Why aren't ALL DVDs offered in widesceen AND pan & scan? I know a few people who despise widescreen. Me, I wouldn't want a film any other way!"
5,The Private Eyes,I received this movie super fast. It is great quality and I have been looking for this movie on DVD for years. Thanks
5,Hilarious Movie,"I remember first seeing this movie on video around '83 or '84. Us kids loved it, so did the adults. We laughed and laughed at it. In my opinion, any of the paid movie critics who have dissed it are morons. It is pretty predictable, as are most slapstick movies. Most of the funny comedy routines have been around since the early 20th century, so we already know the punchlines, but funny will always be funny. Just turn on your TV today and you will see the ""comedy"" that the ""critics"" love. Give me a good ""old-fashioned"" comedy over the new junk that they peddle now."
4,Simply one of the classics...,"In todays world of puke humor, this movie still reels in the laughs without cussing, sex, or rated X gags. Knotts and Conway are the perfect pair to solve the mystery in this one. Buy it, you won't be sorry! My kids love it as much as I did when I was a kid."
3,The Private Eyes Blu-ray,"The picture and quality were excellent. I was disappointed in the comedy duo of Tim Conway and Don Knotts. I was expecting a more funny comedy, but this was slow, reserved, and I fell asleep, sorry."
3,Silly fun!,"Tim Conway and Don Knots work well together, and this movie does prove that. At times there are some direction problems, continuity problems, and even a couple of mic's in shots here and there. It obviously was low budget, but its definately one for the family, with bodily gags and some adult humor. Nothing extremely bad, and kids will find it funny.Some really memorable lines come out of this, but in the end, its mostly bumbling idiot humor typical of the apple dumbling gang."
3,slippery sleuths,great comedy team as wats &holmes like the beach wagon etc they realy left a mark ...
4,Enjoy with a cup of tea!,"I have read and enjoyed all of Maeve Binchy's novels and was lucky to have picked this up in Canada over the summer. There is something welcoming and soothing about all of her novels. This one pulls you into Quentins a chic yet cozy restaurant in Dublin. I only wish I could go there and meet the people and try that wonderful food.Like Scarlett Feather, Quentins celebrates the economic success of 21st Century Ireland, that is after the EU. But this still has the warmth of her earliest novels.I did find the story telling disjointed, but it still flowed. My favorite parts were the short vignettes of patrons of the restaurant. The story line of the missing money grew confusing and tiresone, but the on going story of Quentins si just wonderful!I enjoyed this so much. I do not believe that Maeve Binchy can write a bad book! I plan to reread this again and again!"
4,Indecisive Heroine,"This offers a lot of the typical warmhearted Binchy charm, but you've got to put up with the endless pining and whining of the lead character who has built her life around a cheating womanizing crook. By the halfway point, when Ella Brady repeatedly puts off revealing important information (which would benefit everyone she knows) because her lover entrusted it to her, I wanted to step in, give her a hard shake and slap some sense into her. I got the impression that Binchy was drawing things out because if Ella did the right thing she'd wrap up the plot to quickly."
2,Bernie from Virginia,"I love Maeve Binchey but this is one of the worst books I've ever read, and a solid disappointment coming from such a beloved author. It took me a month to get through it. Ella is a whiney, self-absorbed, selfish character and the book only picks up interest when she's out of the picture. I couldn't figure out why her friends were so supportive when she was so stupid, or why anyone would bother with her at all. The writing borders on childish and the characters too truncated to generate much interest. This is the only one of Binchey's books I have not thoroughly enjoyed. She should have taken more time on this one."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I almost purchased Quentins because I have enjoyed Maeve Binchy's books in the past, but her last few books have lacked the energy her earlier books had. Quentins is boring, tedious to read & has way too many story lines going at once. If you really want to read it, go to the library."
2,Somewhat dissapointing,"Quentins is not your typical Maeve Binchy book. Though I enjoyed parts of this novel, I finished reading it on a dissapointing note. In Quentins, we re-connect with old characters from other novels, like Simon and Maude from Scarlet Feather. What made this novel dissapointing to me was all the space Binchy spent re-acquianting the reader with these old characters. Instead Binchy could well have used the space to develop her new characters to a greater degree. I felt often enough that I couldn't connect personally with the protagonist, Ella Brady, with all the other reminders going on. It was like watching one of those sitcoms where the actors sit and reminisce about times gone by, when all you really wanted to see was the next episode. Instead of trying to draw on our nostalgia for characters in other novels, Binchy should have attempted to write a novel that we could be nostalgic about in the first place."
4,Pleased as punch,"Well, after just finishing Angela's Ashes and Judas in Kilkenny, I was all geared up for another great Irish tale. I was not to be disappointed. Quentin's is a great read in my opinion. The characters are rich and story moves along easily. All-in-all I was very satisified with Maeve's new book."
2,Couldn't finish it,I love Binchey's earlier books but this one is such a disappointment. I really couldn't care about the characters at all.
1,disappointing,"I have always enjoyed reading Maeve Binchy books and I looked forward to reading Quentins. I feel compelled to write to encourage other readers to save your money. The underlying story here is not only unbelieveable, it's rediculous.Ella has an affair with a married man who runs out on her, ruins her father's professional reputation, his health and causes her parents to have to move out of their beloved home. They convert the home into apartments and live in a remodeled shed in the garden. Wait that's not all, the married man leaves his lap-top computer at her apartment before he takes off with his loot. She finds all of the information needed to catch this crook and she doesn't do a thing with it.I guess I am angry because so many authors begin as talented writers, become best seller's and their publisher's think that the reader will continue to buy books solely on their name. Here is one reader who has learned a lesson."
3,"Not the best, if you're a Binchy fan - worth the read","Like many, I loved Circle of Friends, Glass Lake and even Scarlet Feather. I was delighted to see Ms.Binchy continued her saga of Dublin characters with Quentins. Not her best effort...rather dull and boring at times with a shallow predictable plot. But the characters and the stories of Dubliners and Quentins are wonderful. Previous favorite characters resurface, but only in a minor way which was frustrating. Some of the main threads did not get resolved in a satisfactory way. The ending is the sappiest ever. I still enjoyed it."
2,I wouldn't recommend this one.,"Having read and enjoyed a few of Binchy's books in the past, I was looking forward to Quentins. What a disappointment.I felt no sympathy for or idenitification with the main character, Ella. If anything, I found her to be over-bearing. The plot involving Don Richardson was over-the-top and in addition, I got tired of trying to keep the numerous characters and their stories straight. It took me a while to finish this book simply because I'd put it down and find it a chore to pick it up again.Maeve, what happened here?"
2,Uh? What?,"Let me first say, I love Maeve Binchy. I have not read all of her books, but I have read a lot of them. No matter how much I enjoy her work, I must say that a book should not be able to squeak by on the author's name alone. Maybe it would have been better had Binchy retired. This book is weak. I could go into a detailed discussion of the plot as others have done, but how many plot synopses do you readers need? The plot is weak. The characters, though familiar for the most part, are unlikable. And the ending is REALLY predictable. If you must read it, wait for the paperback or buy it used. There are far better books available. And for all of you reviewers who gave the book extra stars just because it is a Binchy book, you're messing up the star system. Stars are for books that shine."
2,What happened?,"My aunt introduced me to Maeve Binchy with her book Evening Class. I hated to put it down! I felt as if I knew the characters and really cared about them; the story was delicious. Now I have read Quentins and I wonder'what happened'? While I understand (and enjoy) that I am not reading Binchy as if reading the Classics, this book is written on a 5th grade level. Character development was almost non-existant and if the author wanted to get from Point A to Point B, she rushed through the character's story to get there. I am very disappointed in this book."
2,Not the Best of Binchy-Underdeveloped,"I really didn't think this book was all that great as I had expected it to be.Ella Brady wants to tell the story of a generation and a city through the history of a restaurant. She wants to film a documentary about Quentins that will capture the spirit of Dublin from the 1970s to the present day. After all, the restaurant saw the people of a city become more confident in everything, from their lifestyles to the food they chose to eat.And Quentins has a thousand stories to tell; tales of love, of betrayal, of revenge; of times when it looked ready for success and of times when it seemed it must close in failure.The book touched on stories of lives of people, but not enough. It really failed to focus on any characters lives at all, and just gave brief explanations of different people in the story.I really felt therefore, that the book lacked depth and meaning.Other books of Binchy are much better."
5,Quentins,"Yes, I loved Quentins as well as any of her other Novels I've read.I usually buy books by Author and Maeve Binchy is one of my favorites. I'm trying to read all her novels. I would recommend any of her books to anyone that enjoy full charters and story's that transport you into the life of the people she is writing about - she spins wonderfully a rich story - makes it hard to put any one of them down and do anything else until the last page. Very readable and good clean writing - nothing tacky in her novels.I also love to read the novels written by Rosamunde Pilcher. she is another one that I am trying to read all her novels."
5,"Binchy, Always a Great Read",I was shocked and pleased when I realized the Maeve Bichy had indeed written another great book. This one is a much quicker read than her previous books. A bit of a disappointment only because I never want the stories to end. It was wonderful to see that the characters that we have met in past books are alive and thriving in Dublin. I would recommend any book by Maeve Binchy. They are all wonderful journeys into the lives of people that you wish you could sit and have a cup of tea with.
3,Quentins,"This was my first Maeve Binchy and I found her writing interesting and an easy read. However, I found the main character of the book hard to relate to. I didn't understand her thinking and found her actions odd. Also the reactions of the people around her were only to support her nomatter what she did and it didn't seem realistic. I guess I was looking for more depth in the characters and that was missing for me. However, because it was an easy and interesting read it hasn't put me off trying another Maeve Binchy sometime."
3,Not as good as her others,"Being a big Maeve Binchy fan it pains me to write that Quentins is not her best work by a long shot. Her characters are generally too good to be true, and it's hard to follow a narrative thread or get invested in these sappy characters. Overally, this was a descent read, but pretty cheaply written."
1,not worth reading,This is a waste of time to read. It is scattered and boring. The characters are undeveloped. She brings in characters from her other more interesting and better written books. This is a cop out from someone who should have stayed retired.
2,Ghost writer ????,"I am a huge Binchy fan and have read everything she has written. But she could NOT have written this book! Perhaps she did not come out of retirement and the publisher had someone else write this using a Binchy 'formula' (it would explain the resurrection of all the old characters)? The dialogue doesn't even seem like Binchy - I can't even hear the Irish 'brogue' in my head - it's all flat. The Ella character is 2-dimensional which is rare in a Binchy novel. And rarely is a Binchy heroine such a naive dope.If Ms Binchy truly wrote this book, then perhaps retirement is the way to go at this point in her life. Quentin's was a waste of my library privilege!"
5,I am going to read her other books now!!,"This was the first book by Maeve Binchy I have read. I really enjoyed this book so much. I probably would have given it 4.5 rating instead of 5, but since I don't have that option I rounded up.It is really beautifully written. I loved the characters. You may read a little snippet about a character, only to have them reappear with much more depth later in the book.The first 100 pages or so were wonderful to read, but it was at that point I was especially hooked. The storyline took a nice suspenseful turn.There were so many wonderful stories within stories that were told between the main story which I so enjoyed.The only reason I was slightly disappointed (and it was just slightly) was that I was expecting a more complete ending. The ending was wonderful, but, for example, I wish I had known more about Margery.Overall, I really enjoyed this read. I am definately going to find Maeve Binchy's other works."
4,Rich characters and story,"This is an excellent story in the rich and entertaining way of Maeve Binchy. She transports the reader (listener) to the actual place and time - or at least makes one wish to join the wonderful characters and the fun activities. This story centers around Quentins, the popular and exquisite restaurant. The chracters in the story are connected in a variety of ways through the restaurant. Some of the characters are known from Binchy's books, Tara Road and Scarlet Feather. A very pleasant read!"
4,I liked it,"I feel that some of the reviewers are being too hard on the author. I have read at least 8 of her book including the last 4. Quentins to me is more like a short collection of short stories and knowing that what she does well is longer books with detailed character development, then it is okay to not expect as much from this short title. I loved Scarlett Feather, Echoes, The Glass Lake and Light a Penny Candle, liked Tara Road and Evening Class... and was only amused by the London Transport... so for Quentins with its moving at a fast summer reading pace, I like it... As others have said it is not her best work, but it is cute and light more or less... So Start with the books that I loved, but if the page count is too high, Quentins is a good book too..."
4,The best yet,"I have read all of Maeve Binchy's books in order to be able to read and understand Quentins. I found that in her book Quentins she finishes some of the stories that ended to soon. You finally find out what happened to Tom and Cathy from Scarlet Feather and also the twins. You hear more about Signora and Aidan from Evening Class, about Colm and Ria from Tara road and you finally get to meet the famous Quentin. Some people may not enjoy this book as much if they have not read these other books, but once you have read Scarlet Feather, Evening Class and Tara road you will love this book. There are also other new characters that I loved to read about and find out more about their lives.The only thing I found a little long in the book was the little short stories, some of the characters described didn't have a big role in the book. Assides from that the book was great and I recommend reading it after reading all the other books that this one makes reference to."
3,It's Okay..,"This is the first book by Maeve Binchy that I have read. I really enjoyed the short stories within the main story, but didn't really care about the main characters or the story line. I enjoyed it for an easy read, I guess I should say it was ""cute""!"
3,Perfect for the Holidays,"I always make it a point of reading something light in between my ""real reading"" and the Quentins was just perfect. A nice story about the goings on in the lives of many people in Dublin. Worth the read!"
5,one the best books I've read this year!,"A graceful, eloquent and moving portrait of a restaurant, QUENTINS. I was sorry when this book ended ~ I wanted it to go on and on. Binchy has written wonderful reads in the past but QUENTINS is the best yet!!! Such a cozy read and an ideal gift for the holidays."
2,A far cry from Binchy's best,"Maeve Binchy is capable of much better work.Quentins' plot is formulaic at best. The characters are shallow and poorly developed. I have read all of Binchy's books, and have been dismayed to see the downhill progression in the quality of her recent output. Both Quentins and Scarlet Feather have been entirely disappointing. Fans of her earlier novels such as Circle of Friends and The Glass Lake should not expect too much of Quentins.Buck up, Ms. Binchy, you can do better than this!"
1,Not her best work,"I couldn't even finish it. It was disjointed and the characters were cardboard cutouts. I think Binchy is a great author and this book is nothing like her other, well written, entertaining novels. I hope the next one will be better."
1,This was NOT Maeve Binchy at her best,"I really looked forward to getting this book and I was terribly terribly disappointed. The ""new"" characters were tired and stale and the dialogue didn't add any value to the book either. Maeve Binchy's other books, like Circle of Friends, or Echoes, or Copper Beech, did a much better job of drawing the reader in. For me, it wasn't so much a matter of too many things going on - but the only character really developed was Brenda. I am sorry that I cannot recommend this book."
2,My First Binchy Read..,"... and it has all been downhill from here. If you are only going to read one, it may as well be this one, though so far, there is a distressingly appalling repetition of themes in her many books... Also, in this one, there are confusing references to previous tales, a trick which does not endear an author to her readers."
2,Formula Driven,"I had never read a Maeve Binchy book before Quentins. I picked up a hard cover edition of the book at a library sale for one dollar. I am sorry to say, it was a dollar wasted. The writing is trite and formula driven. I recycled it with the Sunday papers. Big disappointment!"
1,Poorly written and predictable,"The premise of Quentins was good -- bringing together characters from past books, but without Binchy's usual character development and plot twists this ended up being a very boring read."
3,Disappointed,"Thought grabbing a Binchy book for a good old fashion absorbing story would be a safe bet...having loved so many of her other books. But I never was able to really like the characters for some reason, Ella's relationship with Don seemed over the top, and it quickly became a chore to read."
3,Started off great,"I enjoyed the way Binchy brought characters from previous novels (Scarlet Feather, Tara Rd and Evening Classes) into this book as ive read these books this year. I think it makes the story better if you ve already read these, you ll still be able to follow it if you dont but it does make it more enjoyable. For me it was especially great to see characters like Maud and Simon back.This book did not give the usual twist at the end that some of Binchy's previous books have given and to be honest I didnt really enjoy the ending of this, nothing really happened at the end tbh.Overall a must if youve enjoyed Scarlet Feather, Tara Rd and Evening Classes if you want to know what happened to all the main characters in these books."
3,Discovery Channel myths documentary,"I looked at this title for about a year and waited for someone to review it so I could finally know what the heck it is.It's a documentary. Not a bad one, but more so for children. If you have an interest in fairy tale legends and origin of myths, you'll probably enjoy it as well. It would also make a decent companion to Harry Potter movies and the like, if your kids can't get enough. There's alot of exploration behind meaning of rituals and what ancient sorcerer's activities may have been. For instance, wearing certain masks made from animals were said to convert you into that animal, and so on. You get the idea, it's Discovery Channel. Kinda cool but not really for me."
3,Excellent Product,"This knife really is an excellent product. Well made and with a number of features that you would'nt normally expect to use. For instance, I have made use of the magnifying glass a couple of times since I got this at Christmas time. The blades are also good and sharp."
2,Liquid stevia are much better in drinks,"I bought this stevia to make drinks for my kids at school and to take it for our hiking. For hiking and backpacking it could work somehow, because it does not require refrigeration. But if it would be kept in a water for more than an hour, the taste of a drink would become terrible. For school I use Stevia Clear Liquid Lemon 2 oz orStevia Clear Liquid Extract 4 oz. Save 50% Limited Quantitiesfrom SweetLeaf , which is much better. There are more flavors also."
4,Tastes great - less filling!,"Really, if you don't mind the taste of Stevia these are a great choice, far better than Crystal Light. I put a little less mix than recommended because it doesn't all dissolve in hard water at a teaspoon per quart. Weakens the taste just a bit but I don't really like flavored water that is overpowering."
2,Not really my style,"This book seemed more to be a gay S&M fantasy novel that happened to have vampires in it rather than a vampire novel. I was rather disappointed by how unrealistically the characters seemed to respond to different things, and further disappointed by the inconsistency of the vampire's powers themselves."
3,Mixed bag,"This looks very pretty as it comes from the box but there's a catch. To actually use it for cooking, you must remove the finish. I don't know how difficult that is or what this looks like without the protective lacquer because I didn't take it off. Without the lacquer this copper has the potential for a humongous tarnish, and I didn't want to invite that. The poacher also came with a dent, opening the possibility this is secretly a second or a return. Solid copper poachers, even at auction, cost more than $500. There's got to be a reason this one does not."
5,By the Banks of the Holly,"Wow, was so happy to get this book, written about Mollohans by a Mollohan,since I am a Mollohan. Our family was one of the first settlers in West Virginia."
4,Interesting and thoughtful,"In ""Heart of Gold,"" Sharon Shinn builds a world in which two conflicting societies, the matriarchial indigo and patriarchial gulden have an uneasy coexistence.This book is very interesting, in terms of world-building, with some interesting plot twists. The society has some striking parallels with nineteenth-century America, or South Africa under apartheid; and the plot deals with important themes: sexism, racism, genocide, and social expectations. Nolan is a very sympathetic character: Kit, somewhat less so. She seems to spend quite a lot of time rebelling for the sake of rebelling. I also did not understand why such an intelligent woman was involved with such a cruel, violent person as Jex. I thought her character definitely came alive toward the end of the novel.Although this novel was very good, it lacked the emotional intensity of her other works, which was why I rated it as four stars. Good, but not as great as the superb Sharon Shinn usually writes."
2,"Don't get me wrong, I love Sharon Shinn","If you are going to read one Sharon Shinn novel, please don't let it be this one.Shinn hit three homeruns with her Samaria trilogy. In comparison, Heart of Gold seems suspiciously simplistic. She writes about racism and sexism without adding anything new to the conversation -- one just feels lectured to.Indeed, to me, it seems almost as if the publisher approached her after The Alleluia Files and asked if there was anything hiding away under her bed, any old work that she could possibly dust off for them to print.It is a perfectly good book. However, it is nowhere near the mastery Shinn demonstrates elsewhere."
2,A real disappointment,"Sharon Shin can write wonderful books. This is not one of them. It's not a bad book, it's just a very weak book. The characters lack the texture and depth of the people in her previous novels. The plot is not very original or clever. The world building is incomplete. This reads like a first draft, not a finished book."
3,Not as good as Angelica Series,"First I must state that I love Sharon Shinn's writing. I read every one of her Archangel series plus Mystic Rider and Summers at Castle Auburn and was mesmerized by her writing. Her attention to detail, her character development, plots are excellent. I can't think of another author who writes such hauntingly beutiful books.That being said, I just felt this book was shallow and the subject matter too sci-fi and far less romatic than her other books. I look forward to sequels of Mystic Rider, but I am hesitant to try some of her others after this."
4,Enjoyable way to spend an evening,"This was the first book I'd read by Lisa Hendrix, and to be truthful, what caught my eye was the beautiful cover. By the time I finished, I felt I'd definitely gotten my money's worth.Ms. Hendrix paints a wonderful word portrait of the Irish village life as I remembered it from my visit to Ireland. She has also created a hero and heroine with human failings, but who possess the ability to know when they are wrong and apologize. I enjoyed the interaction between Brian Hanrahan and Tara O'Connell and while the storyline involving the women of Kilbooly was entertaining, I would have liked to have seen more focus on the storyline between Tara and Brian, involving Brian's business ventures and Tara's perceptions and prejudices about them and Brian.If you are looking for a way to spend an evening or two absorbing the flavor of Ireland and getting a love story in the process, then this book is for you."
2,"You lie, I lie, everything lies","A romance built on deception, a heroine who is *this* close to being Ally McBeal, and lots of annoying doormats eager to please their man in one dull concoction. Ugh.This story has promise, but the author relies on lazy, stereotypical characters that ultimately bogs the whole story down. Let's see - the heroine who believes 100% in the hero after her first ooh-la-la (convincing, I'm sure) and then is led on like a puppy by that man, for one. Or another one about how women can't say or do anything without uttering the M and C bad words? (Marriage and commitment, darling.)""To Marry An Irish Rogue"" is definitely ho-hum, I'm afraid."
5,This is what a book should be like!,"For me this was a perfect book, and I rarely say this. (-:It was my first book by Lisa Hendrix, and I won't stop here.The book was well balance, had a great sub characters and great environment. At times it was really funny, and had some great love scenes.The hero and the heroine had a great relationship. They meet, there is a spark, they try to resist it, but not too much. They are reasonable, and you feel like it could have really happen. No murder mystery here, just two people falling in love."
5,Memorable characters in classic romance,"In a quick getaway to the countryside of Ireland, Lisa Hendrix has penned a winner. Television reporter Tara and successful businessman Brian may sound like characters you've seen many times in romances, but be prepared to notice their depth and intelligence in this book. Their fresh conversations are much more enjoyable than those of most typical romances. Strong additional female characters also add to the story in a way not usually seen in this genre. This book provides a fulfilling respite from everyday hum-drum life. Enjoy!"
2,Salad spinner,"Salad spinner doesn't work very well at all. The top tries to come off as you turn the spinner. You have to hold it down with your entire arm, pressing firmly. Spinner is made of flimsy plastic, seems cheaply made."
1,Horrible!!,"I am willing to sell mine for the cost of postage - if anyone wants it! It is so disappointing - the top is hard to fit and the the ""knob appendage"" that is used to spin the salad greens keeps popping up and has to be slammed down again. I really do think this a terrible waste of resources and money. I've only used mine three times and am going out to buy something better (like my zyliss that wore out after many years of use)."
5,Mitutoyo shows excellent quality and precision!,"Mitutoyo has been bringing in high quality precision hand toolsfrom Japan for many years.Their tools are excellent, and long lasting, and this depth micrometeris no exception.It is finished in hard chrome for long wear, and protection from rust andthe abrasion and corrosion that dirty hand s in the shop always bring.The markings are clear, and very black, and easy to read against thematt silver finish of the hard chrome.The spindles are easy to change, and hold their accuracy through manychanges cycles. Recalibration adjustments can be a little finicky, but mostdepth micrometers have this same issue. Included in the box are the adjustment tools.This is the standard depth micrometer in my shop, and it is preferred over all otherbrands, including American made Starrett.This was a gift to my head machinist, but I own 3 of them myself!"
2,"Nice, but overpriced","I expected more from the Samhadi Pro line with these sheets.They are not a bad sheet, but they are not much better (if at all) than good quality flannel sheets bought at a department store.I washed in cold water, used the auto-sense dry option on the dryer, and they shrunk somewhat, but nothing drastic or unexpected.However, they are too small to start with in my opinion.Save yourself some money and go buy a regular set of twin sheets, then buy extra face cradle covers.I hope Earthlite gets their act together on this one and revamps this product."
1,Hoped for better quality,"The flannel sheets fit my table and are quite soft, but the pills are terrible. Three washings in and I'm still getting those little balls of fluff. I've followed the washing directions and it's only after the last washing that I even used the sheets for a client. I didn't want the lint to rub off on the clients' clothes during Reiki sessions."
2,w2000 rebel router table,"The table top was warped, but fixable. Bit changes are slow and painful. The legs are too long for benchtop use and too short for floor standing so a separate table is necessary. I am not at all pleased with the product."
3,Rebel Router Table,"I bought the table about a year ago it is made very well. My biggest complaint with this router table, is there not an easy way to clamp the table down. When you are feeding stock or pushing wood into the table it moves all over the place. The rubber feet on the bottom won't stop it from moving around. The fence takes some time to set up. All in all I wish I had bought another table."
3,Fine 50s Pop Memories,"The excellent voice of the under-rated LaRosa had not yet reached its full maturity when he recorded these tracks for Cadence from 1952-1955, but there are some very big sellers among them that belong in the collection of 50s pop collectors. The real treats here are some of the lesser-known tracks (""Til They've All Gone Home,"" ""Let's Stay Home Tonight"") where LaRosa demonstrates the smooth romantic style that set female hearts aflutter, and they hold the promise of things to come (his excellent ""Love Songs A LaRosa"" album, also available on CD). I should add, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the audio (mono, of course) on this album, taken from the original Cadence master tapes - ignore comments from the reviewer who apparently has a bad CD player (or a defective disc)."
3,Want to correct my comments of the other day.,"""Love Songs A La Rosa"" was on Roulette, not Cadence, for you devoted searchers."
2,Not recommended,"I became familiar with Julius LaRosa back around 1985 when I read about and purchased an lp that he put out on the Audiophile label. I wondered whether I was making a wise investment. After all, he never got that much publicity or recognition. I can say now how glad I am that I took the chance. Mr. LaRosa is unfortunately consigned, through no fault of his own, to that category of entertainers whose talent has been undeservedly ignored.This CD, unfortunately does not serve Mr. LaRosa well. The quality of the sound makes it a trial to listen to for any length of time. There is a CD his that you should get. Go to Amazon.com and look him up under ""La Rosa"" where the ""a"" is separated from the ""R"" by a space. There you will find his, ""Better Than Ever,"" which he recorded a couple of years ago. Get it. You'll like it."
2,Not one of LaRosa's best.,"These are recordings LaRosa did in the mid fifties. I like LaRosa, but this disc should not have been published. The sound is very dated. And the back-up arrangements are very hokey. Save your money.If you are looking for LaRosa on CD try to find the following:""Julius LaRosa"" - Project 3 PRD5116I think this CD is out of print. Perhaps you can find it at one of those sites specializing in used CD's. It's definitely 5-star material and worth the search.""Better Than Ever"" - Avalon ACD-961I got the Avalon from Heartland Music, which puts out a lot of oldies (although ""Better Than Ever"" was recorded in 1996). Mr. LaRosa is starting to show his age on this recording. But I like it. I keep wanting to return to it."
1,Only still photographs.,"Do not buy the Natural Splendor DVD's. These DVD's are misleading. You do get pictures of nature scenes. But, that's what they are, still pictures. What they have done is take still pictures and record them on DVD. The camera pans up and down the still photos. They are not live moving pictures of the landscapes.You do not see flowing rivers or waterfall. You do not see the wind blowing through trees or meadows. You do not see any moving wildlife. You do get a slide show with music. The whole point of the DVD's is missed. We should have got a DVD showing nature in MOTION, not stills. Do not buy.I recommend buying the Naxos Musical Journey series of DVD's. With the Naxos DVD's you get actual live moving pictures of landscapes, accompanied with great music."
3,Didn't live up to the hype,"I was really excited to try these cookies, after reading the reviews. I love tart lemon desserts, and am a huge fan of ginger in all forms. The cookies were very nice, and I am sure that all 12 boxes will get eaten eventually. For me, however, the lemon was not tart enough, and the ginger taste was very mild. I would rate it right alongside the lemon cookie sold by the Girl Scouts - also over priced, but at least you feel like you are contributing to a good cause!"
2,So sad to read trans fat content!,"Total bummer because these cookies truly are delicious. Just bought a box at Trader Joe's, ate one cookie with my tea (loved it!) then I read the trans fat content (1g per cookie), so I had to throw them away!"
5,Surprisingly good,"I have read the U.K. version of the book - titled ""His Majesty's Starship"" - but the story is evidently the same.I found the plot twists very entertaining and consider the lack of some background information of little concern.I certainly wasn't worried about the author missing out any quasi-scientific explanation for currently-impossible techniques. This is something that's missing from a large proportion of S.F. stories.This book has joined the select list of those I can enjoy reading several times - despite being published in a young-adult category.By the way - I guess the author assumed the existing U.K. had finally merged with the European Union and that the Royal Family had taken their remaining supporters with them into space."
1,worst water-based polish on the market,"I had an amazing experience at an organic spa in Philadelphia. I got home and went on Amazon to get my own water based nail polish. I knew about the ""don't use hot water on your hands for 8 hours"" rule with this polish type.This polish does not come out smooth. It is streaky. More streaky than something you get at Walgreens for .99I put 3 coats (3 coats?) on at 9pm last night. I woke up at 8am. I took a shower. The nail polish got all over the place and looked a wreck. I was late for work trying to get the darn stuff off. Worst water based polish ever! The thought is there...but the R&D; needs to be redone!"
3,Good but not great,"Not enough volume output in some situations, but will work well in most applications. A good choice for a low cost digitally tuned radio."
1,Reception is terrible,"I bought this product primarily for tuning in the television broadcasts in my health club. Even at a range of just 10 feet, the reception on this radio is simply terrible."
5,Love My Coby,I searched all over to find a cool little am radio. I take it to take to the Yankee games so I can listen to the commentator. This radio has great reception and is very easy to program presets. I'm impressed that it was so inexpensive.
4,Great companion for walks...,"I have used this radio for several years. It's my companion on my daily walks and keeps me from being bored. Reception is very good outside; in my gym, it's tough because of the steel construction of the building.The one I just ordered is a gift for a daughter who tried mine and liked it.aj"
5,"Sprawling, Hopeful Saga of a Plausible Near-Future","Adventure, cyberpunk, romance, humor, social commentary, originality, plain old sense-of-wonder...whatever you're looking for, you'll find it here. And it isn't the same-old cookie-cutter formula -- DANCE FOR THE IVORY MADONNA offers a fresh take on hoary sf tropes from artificial intelligence and virtual reality to psionics and space colonization. I'll be the first to say it: this novel is a sure dark-horse contender for the year's big sf awards. Do yourself a favor, and give it a try!"
2,"Elephant Vanilla Chai, 4lbs",I've tried other flavored powders chai and this rates low compared to them. Elephan Chai is not very flavorful or rich and I would not buy this product again.
5,Addicting! Absolutely Wonderful Chai!,"I absolutely love this chai. My local coffee shop got me hooked on it and I just had to order it for myself (so I could enjoy it whenever I wanted). I like the Tiger Spice Chai as well, but the Elephant Vanilla is just fantastic. Very creamy and smooth."
5,Great Irish Legend,This is a great story based on the Irish legend of the selties and their human counter-parts. It tells the story of two people from two different world find a unque bond in each other. The actors carry the story beatifuly right to the end. This is a great movie for anyone who loves a good romantic story.
4,A Celtic Tale,"First I would like to say that this made for TV Hallmark movie has a production value that is good enough for the big screen. Scott Glenn gives a fine performance of a fisherman pinning away for his dead wife. He feels his heart and soul is gone and he will never love again. Saffron Burrows plays a Seltie who is trapped on land in her human form, she has no understanding of love. But they are the ill-fated catalyst that each other need to learn that the soul does not die. And the heart has an infinite capacity for love.The movie also shows a stark contrast between good and evil, not subtly in this movie. It is an old romance movie that would have found its heyday a couple of generations ago. I was pleasantly surprised it was made today. This movie is worth watching with your loved one. I am sure your library will have a copy of this movie."
5,An Excellent Irish Style Movie on Mermaids/Selkies,"I highly recommend this movie to all who are favorably interested in Good Selkie/Mermaid movies. The plot is very well done following the myths and legends well. The setting in Ireland is also excellent. During the movie the Selkie speaks alittle about her world/home, and she uses her magic to help two humans in need. The movie also involves a love story."
4,Overall a good album,"The first time I listened to this CD I was at first disappointed. But its because I was flipping through the first few seconds of each song. When I finally really let this album play, I really REALLY enjoyed it. I would recommend it, but give it a chance. A good relaxing album, smooth sexy soft vocals. I am looking for similar artist to this, if anyone has any recommendations please email: ..."
2,Not what I expected,"Although many of the ""amusements"" are amusing - they are also logic tricks that we did in the 3rd grade. Such as moving matchsticks around to form a shape in less than 2 moves....the book just doesn't provide enough of the ""cool"" tricks that I expected from the description.Also, and my biggest complaint, is that many of the tricks use the assumption that I can palm coins, dollar bills, and other items with no effort. If I could palm items, I probably wouldn't be reading this book to learn tricks."
4,funny fat man,Ralpie may what can you say. you gotta have laughter in your heart because if not he will make you want to kill him.... funny and true
2,DO not order from importcds! illegal/incomplete dvd,"I ordered the DVD Ralphie May-Just Correct, from importcds a few weeks back. I ordered it and was looking forward to seeing the extra footage of him in Iraq. The back of the case advertises it, the sleeve inside the case talks about it, BUT it is not on the disc. After loking at the dvd, it does say on the bottom of the DVD :For screening purposes only. Does not contain bunus materials. It also has printed right on the DVD ""Promotion Only: Not for resale""If I wanted to buy illegal Black Market DVD's, I would not have gone to Amazon to do my shopping. Why are they selling a illegal DVD as new? I am a little shocked that you get away with this type of sales.The show was great, but I am suprised that they are selling an illegal/incomplete dvd."
1,THIS GUY IS A HACK,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!! Ralphie May stole most of his jokes from other comedians who perform at ""The Laff Stop"" in houston tx where he did open mic's on monday nights. Support Comedy and dont buy this or anything else from Ralphie May."
1,DANGER: READ AT THE RISK OF YOUR STANDARDS.,"Just read the other reviews and they're evidence enough. This girl dates a non-Christian guy in direct conflict with God's Word, but supposedly she's still a Christian. More than once Ty implies (or just states directly) that he wants everything Pamela has to give--and doesn't mean after they get married. But she keeps on dating him because she's so infatuated. And these other reviewers say you ""want to be in her shoes"" and you ""feel like your in Ty's arms when she is""?? Well, she shouldn't have BEEN in Ty's arms to begin with, and I would hope no Christian girl would make the decisions--correction, *mistakes*--that Pam makes. To make things worse, her involvement with Ty is never portrayed as un-Biblical or wrong, and there are never any consequences. If this is a ""test of faith,"" then Pamela fails miserably."
1,Not a Good Example of Christian Dating,I agree with most of the comments here that this book represents a danger with it's idea that you can date non-christians and witness to them without getting in trouble. It is very unrealistic and in the real world if you did what pamela did you probably would have ended up sleeping with this guy (to be blunt about it). Maybe not but I really don't think that the author took care in thinking about her message in this book. And the rest of the storyline in general is kind of unbelievable anyway.
4,Lighten up...,Non-Christians and Christians dating? Oh the horror! Forbidanyone to spread the word of Christ by spending time with people whodon't know anything about it!Please... Is the goal here to build a wall around ourselves and shut out all who don't subscribe to our every belief?Judy Baer chooses to tackle what happens when a Christian grapples with carnal feelings vs. Christian responsibility. And not badly.
2,The Ultimate Trivia Book?,"This trivia book has over 800 questions on Confederate generals. The problem is that numerous questions are re-used throughout the book. There is also a list of the generals in the back of the book that seems far from complete. It's good points is that it's unlike your regular trivia books due to focussing on a specific area of the war, with questions that will make you want to learn more about these men."
4,A lot of Christmas fun!,"Jimmy McGriff's Christmas album is lively fun! He leads a jazz organ group, and they really go to town on well-known Christmas standards (as well as some originals). We've been playing this disc a lot since we got it a few weeks ago (and that's out of over 200 Xmas CDs) -- it adds energy to the Christmas season!If you like this album, you may also like organist Jimmy Smith's ""Christmas '64"" album (also reissued earlier under a different title), which is a real classic."
5,Sweet and seductive soul classics.,"This 14-track compilation includes both RG&B's Polydor-era hits (""Special Lady"", ""Inside Of You"", ""Happy Anniversary"", etc.) ans dome of The Moments'mid-1970s hits. While lacking liner notes and discographical information the sound quality on all 14 songs is excellent. Buy it now!"
2,What's the point?,"""History Lessons"" is primarily a montage of archival footage that has little or no discernible connection to gay women, optically reprocessed and edited to vaguely imply lesbianism. The endless repetitions of the same lab-aged and otherwise altered footage make this downright tedious at spots. Lots of spots.I first saw ""History Lessons"" at a film festival, accompanied by a talk by director Barbara Hammer. She is a very good speaker and obviously a creative, witty, intelligent person. I like some of her other films, but this one is too rambling and far too long for what it is.Recently, I rewatched bits of the film on DVD. Although the director's ironic, wink-and-nudge approach to some of the footage is clearer on second viewing, I just don't see the point behind this film which is clearly the result of a very time-consuming editing process."
3,"WHAT?!@#@...NO... ""GIVING UP!!""","WHAT MORE IS TO BE SAID. ""THE BOY FROM NEW YORK CITY""; WAS THEIR BEST. HOWEVER...""GIVING UP"" WAS MY FAVORITE. IT'S ALSO THE HARDEST SINGLE TO FIND. YOU'RE LUCKY IF YOU FIND IT ON A COMPILLATION. IF YOU DO...CALL ME!!!... OH YEA...THE COLLECTIONS PRESENTED ON THIS CD ARE AT BEST...FAIR!"
2,Would not recommend it,"As a sailor myself, I can tell you that Peter Nichols knows his stuff. He weaves a good yarn and keeps you reading. His portrayal of both Schenk and Boden was exciting and believable. (I am also a professional novelist and critique manuscripts regularly.) However, the book ends in such hopelessness and for no good reason that I actually slammed the book down in . . . well, hopelessness---so disgusted that I'd just wasted my valuable time. I guess I'm just the old-fashioned type and want a ray of hope in this world of gloom and doom."
2,Lost at Sea,"Although Peter Nichols attempts to create a compelling almost thought provoking thriller about man's greed and the dark animal instincts that lie benieth the skin where the heart does not reach, his depression era piece falls flat or rather ""sinks"" below the weight of poor uncrafted prose, confusing rather confusable and uninteresting characters and a disapointing ending preceded by a climax that leaves something to be desired. In short, I'd rather walk the plank!!!"
3,Prologue vs Prolong,"This book took forever to start, the word is Prologue not Prolong. Normally I don't cut a book that much slack. But the story seemed to have merit.Once they finally started the Voyage to the North Star things got better a lot better. There are a few things to look forward to just gotta get past the first 100 pages."
5,Break out of your comfort zone,Club FascistlandThis is a great book to break out of one's comfort zone. If the characters and settings seem unrealistic - then the reader needs to at least hang out with people of visit places they otherwise wouldn't. This book stays true to the moral of the Wizard of Oz - everyone has a gift and a purpose - they just need to be allowed and nurtured. Its easy to be judgemental when one is part of the accepted majority - this book is perfect for all those who aren't.
1,Showpiece only,"Things you can't learn about the Old Dutch International roasting/lasagna pan before buying it: the body is a nice 1.6 mm thick, but is plated inside with a micro-layer of nickel. This will tarnish to black during cooking and begin to vanish altogether when cleaned for the third time with a product like Wright's Silver Cream. You will quickly be cooking in unprotected copper. On the other hand the copper transfers heat evenly and the handles are just adequate."
5,Great collaboration,"I cannot believe everyone is blasting this CD. First, the reviewer complaining about the mix must have a bad copy or poor audio equipment because this is simply not a problem on my stereo. This is simply put a great collaboration. Elements of both Toad and Nickel Creek are there, but blended. So often great talents working together do not turn out great work because of their inability or stubborness to adapt their effort to the particular project. Presently, Jazz is one of the few genres where the greats constantly play together and produce great works. It is nice to see that here. If you have a chance to see them on tour, I reccomend it. This record not only blends their styles, but advances music in general. It is nice to hear something so original and creative in a time of prepackaged uncreative junk. Sugar hill is a great label for signing such talents and encouraging collaborative efforts."
2,Can you hear me now?,"Can you hear me now? Yes glen, we can hear you. I feel so bad saying this but this cd was mixed like crap. As I listened to the first track in my car I audibly said to myself, ""what the crap is this?"" Glen's voice was so loud and obnoxious. Not that his voice was obnoxious but the fact that I could hear nothing other than his voice. I listened to 3/4 of the song and could not take it anymore, so I skipped to the next song with the hope that the producer was going for a certain sound for that track, and that the rest would be fine. I was wrong. Virtually every song on this albums was mixed the same way. I was trying as hard as I could to listen to the music underneath but to no avail. I can tell that the music would be beautiful if it were audible. I love Nickel Creek. They are one of my favorite groups. I also love Toad, but for heavens sake, what is this? I am glad to see that I am not the only one that has noticed this."
2,Almost but not quite,"I love Nickel Creek, and I love Toad the Wet Sprocket. So I am still a bit surprised that I don't love this cd more. It truly seemed like an interesting combination, but somehow the Mutual Admiration Society concept mysteriously falls flat. For me, the chief sadness in this cd is that Nickel Creek with all their incredible talent morphed into a background house band. One hears them playing along hoping (against all hopes) that they'll really get going or that Sara will sing or Chris will jump in with an incredible mandolin solo or something but this never happens. Glen Phillips does all the vocals and faintly behind him Nickel Creek plays as if they don't want to upstage him. Especially disappointing is they have brilliantly performed several of these songs before in concert (namely, ""Trouble""). If you are a bonafide I-Will-Buy-Everything-Nickel-Creek-Records fan, then go ahead and buy this cd; otherwise, wait until their next release comes out."
2,Why Don't I Like This More?,"I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but 6 Days is not enough time to record an entire album, that's more than a track a day! Have you ever recorded music? Then you would know it takes days just to get one song sounding right. For all the love I have for Glen and Nickel Creek I was astonished that they put out an album like this, there's so much potential here, and you can feel it, but they just needed more time. If James Joyce could give 17 years of his life for ""Finnegan's Wake,"" than I think these ""mutual admirers"" could've donated at least a week to an awesome idea like this, I hope they retry in the future and I'm sure the results will be just splendid, for now, stick to your Toad and Creek CDs and wait it out."
4,"Not separate, but they are equal","I pre-ordered this album two months ago when I found out about its release. I am a HUGE Nickel Creek fan. I wasn't very familiar with Glenn Phillips. I was expecting another Nickel Creek album, with a guest voice. I was very wrong. If you are looking to buy an album that has the Nickel Creek sound that you hear on their past two, then it will only be there in a few tracks. Now with that said...they did change their name to MAS to include a new member, Glenn Phillips. This means that this is a terrific new group that has arrived. MAS has an outstanding sound. Bottom Line: They aren't Nickle Creek or Todd Phillips...they are MAS. I hope that we hear more from them in the future."
1,Not for Nickel Creek Fans,"After a Nickel Creek concert this past summer, I asked Sarah when another album would be coming out and she said this fall. I am really disappointed that this is the album she was referring to.This is not a Nickel Creek cd, they are merely a back-up band here. These are three brilliant musicians whose talent is completely wasted on this album. The songs are bland at best, it's hard to differentiate one from another. There is none of the magic of their first two albums, none of the intricate bluegrass instrumentals that showcaes their skills. If you love Nickel Creek, don't bother with this...you won't even know they're there."
2,Boring disappointment,"I bought this cd without listening to it because I love Nickel Creek so much. What a big mistake. MAS is just dull. In a world of exciting and glorious music, what a disappointment it was to buy this cd."
1,Wait for the next Nickel Creek cd...,"I'm a huge fan of Nickel Creek so I of course bought this CD without listeneing to it first. Big mistake. I was never a fan of Toad the Wet Sprocket but thought if Chris, Sean and Sara were involved it had to be great. But by using these talented youngsters as essentially a backup band for Glen Phillips, it wastes their abilities. There is none of the energy, passion, and spirit found on a Nickel Creek cd or live show on this recording. Overall I just found this cd extremely boring. And due to the fact that I love Nickel Creek so much, the boringness of this cd turned quickly to annoyance. Look for a (slightly!) used copy for sale on Amazon soon!"
5,amazing,I'm surprised by all these negative reviews. The album has so much quiet beauty. It gets better with every listen.
5,Glen never disappoints me!,"Today ""Mutual Admiration Society"" arrived in The Netherlands after a long journey. I was so curious and excited and now - after listening to it - I am simply happy. What a wonderful intimate 'headphone-album'. It's just Glen how I like him best. I don't know what it is about his voice that I love so much - I just do. And when he's singing like on this album: intense, gentle, longing, soft, dreamy, hypnotizing - well there's no escape. I didn't know Nickel Creek before (trusted on Glen) but I think it is a perfect match and the mutual admiration is totally justified.So buy this album, put your headphones on and enjoy!P.S. Can't wait for the next album."
5,Nothing but Admiration for these Mutually Talented Artists,"I just picked up this album because I have been a ""Toad the Wet Sprocket Fan"" for years. Having just been recently introduced to Nickel Creek, I knew that this album would be incredible. This album is an example of a perfect synergy between rock and country. Nickel Creeks Bluegrass sounds fuses perfectly with Glenn's more rock tendencies. Glenn's gritty vocals are incredibly haunting on top of the beautiful melodies that make up this album. I think the best display of this is the first track on the album ""Comes A Time."" This is not one of those album's that you buy for two or three of the tracks that you fall in love with. You will not be able to help but to fall in love with the album as a whole being that each track has it's own unique magic and beauty. I recommend this album to any fan of acoustic rock or beautiful music in general."
2,Cheap shock-value fare.,"This movie is kind of like Natural Born Killers except with a feminist agenda. The fact that it has a feminist agenda does not make the characters any more admirable than Mickey or Mallory. And to boot, this movie doesn't even have the decent acting or excellent cinematography that NBK had. For this much money, I'd avoid this movie."
1,Shame on First Run Features,I saw this movie on Direct T.V. a couple of yesrs ago and made a vhs copy that I still have. The movie itself is very good and quite disturbing and I would rate it four stars. The dvd release by First Run Features is disappointing. The picture is too rich in color and too dark. I compared the copy I made from satalite to the dvd and the satalite copy actually has a brighter film like look to it. There are no sub-titles or closed captioning which which would help us in knowing what is being said. There are no extras to speak of. Maybe 7 or 8 stills and 4 trailers of other movies they want to sell us. There is no way I would recommend this dvd or ever buy anything else from First Run Features
1,Totally sux without a tv,"We got nice sounds, but no picture! Totally sux that this tv went out on us after only about a little over 5 years, but nothing last forever, but it still sux :( Paid over $3500 for the tv + a couple of hundred bucks for the stand (which we drove 2.5 hours out of town to get the stand) we thought it would stay longer with us :( Oh, well we are not going to repair it cause how long will the repair last, so no more Hitachi brand for us and before it goes to an electronic recycling place, it will be in bits and pieces so no one else can have it :)!"
2,Parts and Repair,"My Hitachi 55HDS69 was 4 years old Oct. 2010. Like the previous person's review, we heard a boom and then no picture but sound was still good. We called Hitachi and they referred us to a technician. He said the bumper or buffer board was gone . That was about Dec.20. 2010. It is now January 24, 2011. My TV is still on the floor and I am still getting the run around about the parts. It has been over a month and they told me today to give them 10 more days. We are very upset. We paid over $3,000 for this TV. Is This the best they can do. I think I should be compensated for my time without a TV. Someone HELP!!!"
3,O.K.,"I bought this for my 4 yr. She loves this but, this game hardly helps your child learn. If you want your kid just to have fun and loves care bears this would be a good buy. If you are buying this for learning... no. Pooh Bear Smartridge and the Smartridge that comes with v smile is better."
3,Not very exciting.,This V-Smile game is very simple and not very engaging. My 4 year old doesn't like it as much any more but it is a good one for the 2 year old.
2,Not so great.,Got this for my daughter's birthday because she loves cares bears. This is definately not one of v.smiles better games. Done poorly. Very disappointing.
2,I agree with the other parents,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter. It was too easy, and very boring. She wont even play it. There's 20.00 down the drain. Don't buy it. I am working on getting her some of the other games. I hope they will be better at teaching her."
5,Great Game,"I bought this game for my 4 and 5 year old daughters, both have experience using computer games, and joystick games. I think it is a wonderful game, they both enjoy playing it. I really havent noticed them being bored with it, they wont play it for hours, but I really dont want them using the video game system for hours anyway. It is simple, and was really easy for them to figure out, but I think that is part of the reason they enjoy the game. It isnt too hard for them to play like some of the other vsmile games. As far as learning goes, it is mostly color, shape, letter and number recognition, so for an older child (6 and up) it would probably be a little boring. but for ages 3-5, I think it is great."
1,TOO EASY!!,"When we bought my daughter the v-smile game system we got her this game to go along with it. She never hardly plays it because it is so simple. Chasing color balloons and stars, catching a falling letter. Chasing shapes that appear in the exact order you are supposed to put them in. If your child is having problems learning how to use a joy stick this game may help them master that, but it is not challenging for children at all."
1,Care for your wallet instead of this game!,"My 3 year old son absolutely adores the Alphabet Park Adventure game that came with the V-Smile. Seeing his excitement, I ran to two different stores to look for more games. The first was sold out, but the second had Care Bears. As soon as I got home and started the game for him, I immediately understood why the game was the only one available. My son looked at me like I was crazy, then ran off and played with his other toys. There is no ""adventure"" in the learning adventure portion of the game. The tasks are extremely easy and very repetative. There are no goals to reach (like how many power rings you can get, how many life hearts you can maintain) and absolutely no challenge to the mind or imagination. I am going to beg the store I purchased it at to give me some sort of refund, even if it is 1/2 the price. Please please please, save your $20.00 and buy Lion King or Winnie the Poo for your loving, intelligent 3-5 year olds."
2,Too Easy,"We just bought the v-smile system for my daughter (3 1/2) for Christmas. She loves playing the game that was included, but this game is just TOO SLOW. The activities are hardly challenging, the characters move slow, and there really is not much to choose from. Spend your money on a different game."
1,Tedious,"Merton's work has shaped much of twentieth century American sociology. His work in the areas of anomie and deviance are especially useful. His work on the sociology of science is not. In taking a purely institutional approach, he misses much of what occurs in the actual practice of science. He wholesale buys the ideology of science. In doing so, he ignores practices and universalizes the contemporary understanding of what science ""is"" across space and time. More than that, however, he treats the content of scientific knoweldge as though it is beyond sociological understanding. For those interested in the historical development of the sociology of science, this is probably a necessary read. For others with an interest in the topic, it is probably best overlooked."
5,Perfect Boots,"I spent several winter seasons searching department stores and online for the ""perfect boots"". I wanted something tall, with a slight heel, with a cross between the riding and 'motorcycle' styles. Leave it to Nine West to create the perfect boot! The leather is high-quality, the boot is comfortable enough to wear for a complete day of shopping or running errands, it is the perfect height, and the buckles add decoration without being overpowering. It looks great with a skirt! The only complaint I've heard from others with this boot is that the heel is not soft rubber and does make a noise when you walk on hard surfaces. Personally, I do not find this to be a problem as it makes no more noise than high heels and I think a boot this great should not walk by unnoticed! I've had these boots for a year and I am still excited every time I put them on. They just look better the more you wear them in."
5,Nine West Boot,Awesome boot for the price. True to size. Great look and very comfortable. Leather lined. Would highly recommend.
5,great boots!,These are great boots! They are wide enough in the toe box and nice and soft inside. A good sturdy heel means long pain-free wear. And they go with my pirate outfit.
4,I love these boots,These boots are stylish and extremely comfortable. The only downside is that they are darker than I had hoped - they look black in dim light.
5,A Hell of a Book!,"This latest Hollywood book by Sam Staggs is even better than the one about All About Eve. This is even better written and isn't inundated with the personal opinions that plagued the earlier volume. This one hits the mark much better in that he tells the story of the making of this classic with well-researched information not disrupted by supposition.Revealing interviews with cast and crew like Nancy Olson are not only revealing in their tales of life on the sound stage but are actually legitimately informative. Staggs' narrative flows smoothly and makes you feel as if you were present at the interviews and during the research itself.In addition, this is a fun read. I heartily recommend it."
4,A Good Read,"Reading a series of late 40's back stories; I read 'Close-up....'I enjoyed it but was only a bit disappointed that it wasn't as wonderful as 'All About, All About Eve' or 'When Blanche Met Brando.' The information on Miss Swanson's later life in New York City was very interesting and the best part of the book. Keep writing these books Mr. Staggs!"
2,"Great subject, mediocre treatment","I read and enjoyed Staggs's book about All About Eve, but it was a bit too self-referential. But this one goes over the top. Staggs inserts himself into the narrative far too frequently, often with salacious but irrelevant anecdotes. And for someone who takes others to task for creating purple prose, Staggs's writing is all too violet for my taste.For example: ""At the age of fifty, [Swanson] had devolved from the great silver screen to the thirteen-inch home set, and those wonderful people out there in the dark now kept the lights on, talked back, munched frozen dinners, washed them down with beer and, in place of tears and laughter, emitted loud satisfied burps.""Puh-leez.Bottom line: the behind-the-scenes info is dishy and enjoyable, but the writing style is irritating."
2,Mediocre and Superficial at Best,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. It appears that the directors gathered some stock footage of the recent tsunami (and other types of disasters) that had both English and foreign language commentaries. When the foreign language commentators (probably from a news report in the native country) finished their monologues, an English translator then provided his interpretation. After awhile, this 'doublespeak' became quite tiresome. Also, there was absolutely no in-depth analysis of why these events happened. Or what can be done to help prevent them (if anything). There was no mention of hurricanes or cyclones in the flooding section of the DVD. Did you know that floods occur because too much rain falls and the rivers rise out of their banks? That is about the level of superficial scientific analysis in this DVD. Save your money and watch the National Geographic TV channel for better disaster coverage and analysis."
1,Don't Overpay,"Don't get me wrong. I love ATHF. But you can buy all the individual sets cheaper than in this collection,(at least at the time of this note) so why pay extra? It's not like you're getting more material, or even special packaging.Don't be seduced by price gouging!"
2,This book is the online help documents!,What both of these reviewers forget to mention is that this book is essentially word for word a published version of the on-line help availble in the Flash 8 help menu. That probably explains all of those terms that aren't explained too well -- this is a hypertext document.
3,Nice intermediate book,"Let me preface this comment by stating I've only read about 125 pages so far. Having said that, I would have to agree with Robert from Australia - this book is better suited for an intermediate user who has some programming experience. This book has a lot of good info (from what I've read and scanned over) but I think the organization could be much better. Often terms are used that have not even been defined till later in the chapter. This gets a little confusing for someone like myself with little programming knowledge. I'm looking forward to finishing this text but I can tell it will be a bit of a challenge because of its organization. It really is designed more like a reference book because there are many statements like ""For more information [on such and such] see....."" throughout the text. I just wish they wouldn't have referred to this book as a 'beginning' book for learning Actionscript 2."
3,"OK, but could be better","It's an alright book that teaches you some great pieces of actionscript, but it doesn't neccesarily show you how to put the pieces together. It sometimes seems like it was written for people that have a grasp on AS already, not someone who is just starting out."
2,There are better uses of your time and money for learning actionscript.,"I bought this book mostly as a reference, and when browsing through it, I realized that this is not a utility for learning actionscript at all. Were I just learning actionscript for the first time from this book, I would be lost. I recommend Lynda.com's video courses for actionscript or picking up a book from Friends of ED, such as Foundation ActionScript for Flash 8. Friends of ED always has high quality books, and although I've not read the newest Foundation ActionScript, it has to be better for the beginner than this one. Save your money and invest in the ActionScript 2.0 Reference from Macromedia, or better yet, just use the amazing help resource built in to Flash itself!"
3,"Okay, but not the best","The is the second book I bought from Macromedia Press dealing with Action Script. The first one I bought was Flash MX Professional 2004 application development.ISBN 0-321-23834-6I would by that versus this one if you are looking for a well written intermediate read for Application Development for Flash.This book is disjointed and it references itself in places you haven't read yet. I also have found a number of code typos, so if you are new to Action Script, pay close attention."
4,Good but Boring,"This is a good comprehensive subject but can be boring for a more advance programmer, it is just like the syntax for a lot of other languages but is not as exciting to read as other programming languages I have read up on, but to know what is needed this is a good book to get."
1,Grand Canyon: A Diifferent View,"Fortunately I didn't purchase this book, just borrowed it. The photographs are stunning, but much like the literal view from the Bible, this book is all image and no real stubstance. It reminded me of a lady in Dinosaur National Park's enclosed dinosaur gravesite telling her baffled daughter, ""See what the Devil does to confuse man."" Science does make belief sometimes very trying.The difference here is that scientists are never always certain just what they will discover and they are willing if not eager for other scientists to refute their finds. This is how you eventually arrive at the truth. In contrast, the contributors to this book already know the answer, it is indisputable, and they plunge forward with weak and irrelevant data in their feeble attempt to prove and propagate these myths.Great book for creationists though. It will help them feel much more secure in their collective ignorance."
1,You've got to be kidding,I am a serious amateur geologist and a devout Christian. You've got to be kidding with this book. That it was forced to be put into the Grand Canyon book shops is absurd. What prompted me to write a review is that I heard that the park rangers at the Grand Canyon are no longer permitted to discuss the age of the Grand Canyon. This is evangelical socialist realism at its worst. It's time for me to put my pet dinosaur to bed.
2,Lovely photographs..questionable science,"It's good that the book is in the spiritual section of the national park service bookstore, because it's a religious book. It has some beautiful photographs but its the questionable 'science' that I disagree with. At least the book is selling and bring money into the government coffers. Just keep it in the spiritual section.The Grand Canyon and the Southwest by Ansel Adams is my favorite book and Ansel Adams was the greatest photographer I have ever known."
1,if you have a brain......,"As a practicing 'real live' geologist over the past 30 years, who has worked extensively in the Grand Canyon area, I can only suggest that instead of reading the nonsense presented in this book that one consider buying the a knowledgeable source on the geology of the Grand Canyon ('Grand Canyon Geology' edited by Beus and Morales). Unfortunately, the type of folks who will willingly buy this book feel more comfortable in a 'soft and fuzzy' world where everything has a simple explanation. WAKE UP! If you believe in the beauty of what you may consider to be 'God's Creation' then do not be afraid to embrace the astounding beauty of geologic complexity. If not, you may just as well read comic books."
1,Religious dogma masquerading as scientific theory,"From a recent letter by PEER to the Director of the National Park Service, regarding sales of this book at the Grand Canyon bookstore:'On January 25, 2004 David Shaver, the Chief of the Park Service's Geologic Resources Division sent a memo (enclosed) to NPS Headquarters calling for removal of the book, concluding -- ""Our review of ...NPS policies and Grand Canyon: A Different View, lead us to conclude that this book: does not use accurate, professional and scholarly knowledge; is not based on science but a specific religious doctrine; does not further the public's understanding of the Grand Canyon's existence; does not further the mission of the National Park Service...and finally, that this book should not have been approved for sale in NPS affiliated book sales.""'Enough said, I think. Let's not waste time on pseudoscience."
1,Rubbish with a pretty cover,"A true wolf in sheep's clothing. I can't believe that people of faith -- any faith -- would believe this garbage. And, what, if we don't like this book we'll burn for all eternity? I don't recall reading that in the Bible anywhere.Because it's not there.Virtually every Scripture Scholar in the world understands the beautiful teachings of the Christian Creation Myths, and their importance. If you really believe that the story of Adam and Eve is really about two naked little people running around in the woods stealing fruit, well, you won't burn for all eternity -- you're just missing the many profound points of the Creation Myths in the Bible.This book is an insult to believers everywhere."
3,Biting Satire!,"Not quite the irreverent genius of something like Catch-22, or the lowbrow hillarity of the Daily Show's America, but will look great on the coffee table next to latter.Beautiful photos too!"
1,pseudo-science faith-based non-sense,"Unfortunately, this tripe is served by the grand canyon bookstore. Your tax dollars being spent to promote garbage thinking that went out with science. Blah."
1,Get over yourselves,"Okay, now the bitterness and bile has spilled over into the realms of Amazon.com now? You people on both sides of this issue need to leave your religious bickering on the sidelines and leave this space for legitimate reviews, not for theological musings (or pseudo-musings better yet). I admit, this book is silly, but not because of anyones belief system. It's just plain silly. Simple as that."
1,"Sad, but entertaining","It's sad that some people take this book seriously, but I suppose one could say it's entertaining."
5,These are not reviews,The reviews I've read on this book are basically not reviews of the book. They are people saying whether or not they agree with and believe the creationist standpoint or the evolutionist standpoint. Creationists give 5 stars and evolutionists give 1 star. Hilarious. Creation scientists hold the same PhD's as other scientists and their studies deserve serious consideration. I loved the book. It is real science. Anyone wanting more of the same can see the Institute for Creation Research materials.
4,Enjoyed reading through this book,"Most of this book dealt with explaining how the geological build of the Grand Canyon can be explained to have happened in a short period of time, thus providing a basis for a young earth. I thought they did a good job explaining the concepts and also covering the inaccuracy issues with different radioactive decay dating techniques. I took off a star because the latter part of the book that talked about flora, fauna and animal life. I felt that it did not really have any direction, unlike the rest of the book. Overall, the book was well done, provided some interesting information, and was presented in an easy to understand format."
