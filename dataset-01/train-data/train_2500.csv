4,Helpful and Encouraging,"This book is packed with different ideas about how to put away a pay check while cruising. The book also includes helpful material about how to approach the job market in a way that you don't upset the locals, something many of us don't consider. On the other hand, I found many of the author's suggestions for those of us with hands on skills, no professional skills, or no skills at all were on the common sense level (chartering, restaurant, hotel, construction, boat work, etc.). If you have some of the professional skills mentioned in this book (IT professionals, teachers, advertising execs, etc.), the author describes ways to take your career on the water. On the whole, it was a good read that sparked the imagination with future possibilities. Overall, I would recommend it."
4,A good textbook from the expert himself,"Professor Schopf has been teaching at UCLA since the sixties, and I've had the honor of taking one of his classes where ""Major Events"" was a required textbook. The man himself has won more academic awards than you can shake a fist at, and his vast knowledge is noticeable on these pages. Also from his experience of teaching undergraduates, the book is easy to read and full of pictures and illustrations. I highly recommend this book for anyone doing research on evolution and prehistoric geography."
5,Parnell Hall Has a Style All His Own,"As a mystery writer with a book in its initial release, I have long admired Parnell Hall's work because of his unique approach to the mystery genre. His style and voice are entirely his own. COZY, his new Stanley Hastings outing, perfectly illustrates what I admire about Hall and his writing. Hastings and his wife travel to a New Hampshire bed and breakfast where a series of homicides immediately begin to occur. The local police, in the manner of the long history of cozies, mishandle every clue. Hastings finds that he must solve the crimes in this well-plotted mystery. COZY is a solid work by a solid writer who keeps his tone light and his approach, in this book, breezy. I recommend COZY highly."
1,Brian better watch out,"At least Bon can rest in peace knowing that if Brian cant sing, that Wing can just jump in and take over."
1,someone shoot me!,"Someone shoot me, please!there are no mp3 AC/DC's songs I can download from this site and yet this woman finds a way to desecrate their classics....and sell them as mp3 downloads!"
1,WTF?,"I can handle Hayseed Dixie, A Hillbilly Tribute To AC/DC but this is just plain wrong! This is sacrilege."
2,Maybe ok depending on cable,"I bought this for a wiring upgrade project for my car. It works ok if two conditions are met:1) The cable has hard vinyl type insulation, and2) the conductor inside is perfectly centered and perfectly round.Unfortunately I was using 1/0 AWG cable with a thick rubbery insulator, and the strands were not perfectly round inside the cable. This lead to the not especially sharp blade dragging the cable rather than slicing it, and damaging many of the conductor strands. I was able to do a far better job with a simple jacknife blade.The description states ""extra BLADES"". There is only one extra blade included inside the handle, and the spring loaded clamp that pulls the cable against the blade was different (not black and apparently a reinforced casting as in the Amazon site photo, but a bent piece of cheaply chromed flat metal stock."
3,CD-R release,"BEFORE YOU BUY - keep in mind that this a CD-R release (as are all Instant Live releases as far as I know). All of the concerts in the series sound good, but require a certain amount of equilization (usually too much bass)."
2,"weak filament, cheapest bulb","These are the cheapest DVY bulbs you can find, but the filament will break with the slightest jostling. Might be fine for a projector, but for movie lights you'll need a more lasting bulb. I had a few production days go kaput because all my bulbs blew out."
3,MC 5 - 'Live Detroit 1968 - 69' (Revenge),"Another good archive live recording of the Motor City Five in their heyday. I heard there's an extended version of this same release available. Not sure if it's extra tracks or longer versions of the eight songs that appear on this disc. 'Live Detroit 1968-69' features some worthy material, like the twelve-minute ""Come On Down"", the ass kicking ""Looking At You"" and ""Fire Of Love"". Maybe not quite as good as 'Teenage Lust' or 'Kick Out The Jams' (see my reviews on both of those titles) ,but still enough to satisfy any true MC 5 fan. Die hards will,of course even enjoy it more."
2,it didn't fit my warn winch,"i bought this winch mount along with a warn winch..the reason, i thought because both products were made by warn, they would work together. but the bolt pattern was wrong for the winch.. and i had to buy another one. also, it was expensive.. about $94. the one i bought that worked only cost $40 at harbor freight."
4,Too Expensive,"This product is great, but the price here is too high. Bed Bath & Beyond carries this same set for only 19.99."
4,quick shipping,I bought this as a last minute Christmas gift and didn't expect it to come before Christmas. But it did.
5,The Best Pedicure Kit I ever had!!!!,"It works just as it is suppose to. its just like getting a pedicure at the salon, but instead it in your own home. I really love it!!!!!!!!"
4,Great watch but ...,"They break more often than I would have expected.I have had this style Luminox watch for almost 7 years. The watch has accuracy and can take being dunked in saltwater, and has a high quality case and crystal. Over the time I have owned it, I would say the luminescence has decreased about 30% - consistent with the 12.3 year half-life of tritium.It's broken a few times and each time it was fixable. Up to now, I figure the watch, repairs, new batteries, and bands all told have cost me around $340. Just sent it in for a problem with the movement and the quoted $90 tab for repair, battery, and band convinced me to go out and buy a new watch."
1,12 minutes!,This is 12 minutes Long. You can see it on the web. I was ripped off. I thought I was getting 60 minutes.
4,A Doleful Film of a Groundbreaking Play,"Filmed during the freezing winter of 1963, Clive Donner's THE CARETAKER is a faithful translation of Pinter's groundbreaking stage play. In cinematic terms, it perhaps lacks interest, but it preserves for ever the wonderful performance of Donald Pleasance as Davies, the tramp entering Aston's and Mick's lives. Alternately dominant, wheedling, plaintive, irritating and attention-seeking, he commands the viewer's attention throughout the film. Ably supported by Alan Bates, the film should be approached as a piece of filmed theater."
2,A Big Disappointment,"S.Dunn's world seems to have shrunk to the size of a walnut since he won the Pulitzer Prize. The poems in this new collection lack oxygen. They are without energy, without spark. Even thinking about the 9/11 tragedy fails to energize Dunn's self-absorbing mumblings.The old saying is true: ""A man wrapped up in himself makes a very small package."""
4,Basic Sailing Theory Book,I purchased the book for my husband at the recommendation of a friend. He found it helpful and it contained quite a bit of information. It appears this version is not as detailed as some other editions of the book. Some of sailing terms were not in the book. It is a great reference book to have. We are getting into more sailing so it is good to have the technical to go with the practical experience my husband is gaining.
5,Naam for happiness!,"Easy to follow and understand. It was great for a beginner like me. Great dvd. Every read the book ""The Secret"" (Oprah endorsed and countless others)? Naam is other secret! Thanks Elena!"
1,May be for Phd people,"this book is soooo sophisticated and not educational style at all, the author is speaking to himself may be.to make it simple, this book is not a beginer wants to learn how desin a filter with labview."
5,duckman rides again,gald a top quaility recording is here. this will replace a older set i purchased several years ago.
5,The Greatest Show Ever!,This box set is perfect for the Duckman fan. It is a must if you are a fan of the series.
4,What a Wild and Crazy Lady !!,"Her version of Talk Dirty to the Animals is classic. And the Dog In Taiwan song is hilarius. I bought both Volume One and Two of her recentshow ""Songs To Offend"" in San Francisco. Great entertainer."
4,Time Capsules,"While living in the UK I became fascinated by the history of the London subway system (aka the London Underground). I was quite surprised to learn that there are several old stations, some dating back 100 years or more, that are still in existence but not used.Why are these stations still around? Some are used to try out new station renovations before the changes are rolled out to the active system. Some are used in TV and movies; for instance the old Aldwych station can be seen in the movie ""V for Vendetta"".This book is a good primer for anyone interested in the London Underground and does much to explain some of the names and places in its history. The only drawback is its lack of a modern map showing the locations of the stations covered and their relation to current stations."
4,This is a very useful book for dedicated Shadowrun players.,"Prime Runners is a detailed sourcebook of NPC's for Shadowrun GM's. The characters included in the book are well-developed, with several adventure hooks to help GM's whose creative juices may have temporarily dried up. The entries are well documented, and the Prime Terrors section in the book make great adversaries for elite shadowrunners who think they have seen it all."
2,Spoiled Child & Choppy Plot,"First off, I usually loved Linda Lael Miller's books & in fact own most of them if not all. But, this is not one I'm going to keep. Unlike her other books in this series this book makes me grind my teeth in frustration over such a vain, silly, unthinking heroine who goes off half-cocked at every turn. Spent most of book amazed that the hero kept coming back for more, ugh. The Stone Creek series, the Orphan Train trilogy, The Outlaw, The Man From Stone Creek - all these books had depth and plots that were rich and warm. I tried to give it 3 stars but just couldn't. She is so much better than this."
1,Corbin's Fancy,I only read books that are text to speech enabled. Audioable charges to much money for their product. So sorry I wont be able to read any of Linda Leal Miller's latest releases. Sight impaired women love the speech to text ability. Why are some books enabled and others are not?
5,Good read,"Got this one first and enjoyed the book. However it is the last in a series of four books. Ordered all of the other books on 5/6/10 BUT to this date have NOT received Memory's Embrace. Lost inmail???? No response from the company I ordered this book from, nor from Amazon....."
5,Hard to put down!,Don't bother reading this book until you have time to read the whole thing at once. :) It's so hard to put down. I buy Mrs. Miller's books based on her name only. I know a book with her name on it is going to be great and I haven't been disappointed once.
1,My taste in romance is apparently very different...,"This is my first LLM romance. I was awfully disappointed. I didn't find the humor in this one that others have talked about. I just don't find spoiled, selfish, cruel people humorous. She runs out in the middle of her wedding - w/o so much as telling her family why (leaving them to worry about what happened to her for 4 days); marries a stranger 2 days later; supposedly falls in love with the stranger 2 days after that; then proceeds to treat this man she supposedly loves like [dirt] every time she opens her mouth, embarrasses & humiliates him in front of EVERYONE she possibly can in his own home town! I didn't see a reason for him to fall in love with someone like that.Written in a different style, the story itself could have been entertaining & interesting. Quinn made a great hero & definitely deserved a much more admirable heroine."
1,Not Miller's best,It's obvious that this is one of Miller's earlier books. She's come a long way since then. Also obvious that this is the last of a series. Far too many cameos by characters that don't add to the plot of this book.
5,Good Pump...So Far,"The pump has been in our minivan for about a month and has been great. We bought an aftermarket pump last year and it only lasted six months, so we'll see how this one holds up."
4,hiphop at its best,a household item for all real hiphop fans.it has covered all the elements of hiphop to the core.it's truelly a fantastic classic dvd for all hiphop heads.
4,Worth owning,"While not lengthy, the documentary covers quite a bit during its short runtime.Specifically the history of Lyricist Lounge and Good Life.I also enjoyed the Supernat footage."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CARD IF YOU USE WINDOWS 98SE,"I AM DISGUSTED TO REALIZE THAT ALTHOUGH CRUCIAL MARKETS THIS CARD AS COMING WITH A DRIVER FOR WIN98SE, IT DOES NOT. THE CD IT CAME WITH DID NOT HAVE A DRIVER (although it said it did) THE WEB SIGHT DOES NOT HAVE DRIVERS AND AFTER TWO PROMISES ON THE PHONE FROM CRUCIAL TECH SUPPORT PROMISING TO SEND ME ONE, I STILL DON'T HAVE IT. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS DRIVER EXISTS. SO MUCH FOR TRUTH IN ADVERTISING AND AMERICAN COMPANY INTEGRITY."
3,se averio al 3er mes,"buen lector, sencillamente un dia dejo de funcionar, aproximadamente al 3er mes de uso...."
2,rather disappointed,I don't think you should waste your money. The disc looks like a home burned CD-R and not a glass mastered disc. The narrator speaks too fast and the background has awful and cheesy sound effects. Several audio tracks stop dead in mid sentence. It's just not worth it.
1,Buyer Beware!!!!!,"Watch Out!!!!!!! I bought the CD and found that it wouldn't play in any CD player. Ditto for the so called ""Bonus Material"" I think this is some sort of scam so watch out."
4,Bad Man Makes For Good Music!,"According to the liner notes, Ford has been shot, stabbed and poisoned and his ankles bear the scars of chain gang shackles. As if that weren't enough, the self proclaimed boss of the blues announces at the beginning of the CD that he ""ain't never been to school a day in [his] life and can't read or write"". All that may be true, but one thing's for sure the man from Greenville, Mississippi certainly has the credentials to play the blues.Lesser known perhaps than RL Burnside or the late Junior Kimbrough, he is every bit as interesting. Ford's style is unconventional and uncompromising and he plays blues using the old blues standard of three chords and the truth. Songs straight from the heart, raw, rough and ready to be heard."
5,Chocolate Candy Making,"A gift for a young cousin interested in making candy from chocolate for Christmas and other occasions, arrived well in time to use for Christmas and in good shape packaging etc..From what I am told they still have not grown tired of it, have included friends in on this now too so as it turned out I am happy with the results of an inexpensive gift with the potential to allow team work and new ideas to grow along with the satisfaction of making something one's self."
2,"Not intended for customer installation, need to take it to a bike shop for installation.","I guess I should've done more homework before buying. There are slip-on ISO grips available, these aren't them, these require removing the throttle cable connections and adjusting the cable. I had to take it to a bike shop and pay for a half hour of labor for installation and they told me to keep my originals because the throttle cable connector on the grip doesn't match up like the original and if the throttle feels like it isn't twisting properly I'll have to re-install the originals. So far, I haven't had to do that."
2,Pretty Disappointing ...,"The book is not geared to an 8 year old -- it's geared to a VERY beginning reader. Furthermore, it has a picture of dancers in hard shoes purportedly doing a ""Reel"" and dancers in hard shoes purportedly doing a ""Light Jig"" -- both of which are SOFT SHOE (Ghillie) dances. My 9 year old Irish Dancer and her class and instructors all got a tremendous laugh out of it though. My daughter's exact statement was: ""you shouldn't write a book if you don't know what you're talking about."" Words o'wisdom? It would be fine for a 4 or 5 year old, but no more."
2,Cute but not accurate,"There is so little Irish dance literature out there that I was excited to find this book being a dancer myself. Regardless of the level of difficulty I would not recommend this book for any child that wants to learn about Irish dance. The information is not correct. Reels and light jigs are soft shoe dances, not hard shoe dances as stated in the book. You can find more accurate information on the Internet about Irish dance. Don't provide your children with misinformation about Irish dance."
3,"Great reference, but a bit outdated","This is a great starter reference on hops. It has descriptions, uses, tips about buying hops, what to look for, and even tips on growing your own hops.My only problem with this reference is that it is now a bit outdated, as many new types of hops have been introduced since this book was released. These are, of course, not covered. I am hoping the author will release an updated version."
5,how the hell do you charge 134.00 for a freakin tab book,come one guys it's a freakin book on how to play their songs man
3,"Good for the basics, but nothing more","This DVD covers just the basics of operating your Garmin eTrex Venture CX. For example, it includes instructions on how to mark a waypoint, find a waypoint, and change the default info fields. I would think that anyone who has played with their Venture for 15-20 minutes has already figured that out and moved on to the more sophisticated uses of the GPS.The production qualities are pretty low too. I had hoped that the video would represent the screen of the Venture with full-screen images. Instead, they've set it up with a Venture sitting on a table, and the camera mounted above it. To show how to perform various tasks, you see a hand enter the video screen, push the buttons, and then pull out of the screen. This makes it nearly difficult to actually see what's happening on the Venture screen.Beyond the (in my opinion) simple stuff, it falls short."
4,Must Rest for Baby Boomers,"Expecially in the New York area, but baby boomers all over will perhaps see some of themselves in this book. Nice interface between family history and events of the times."
4,Perfect travel board,"This plastic board folds up small and has room for a deck of cards. Everything is self contained so you don't need to carry anything else. When folded it is a small, compact board that doesn't take up much space.The hinge pin can fall out if it gets dropped too many times."
2,Bad remixes...bootleg?,"According to the T'pau website these remixes were done without permission from Carol Decker. But even worse it these mixes sound very generic, kind of what you would expect any ballad that gets turned into a dance remix. This should be for hardcore fans only, like me. But I did not even like this. This is a new recording of this song, but its totally wasted on this disc."
4,Love the duster,"I was stumped for a Father's Day gift for my dad, but he recently bought a dark-colored car, which often looks dusty. He is in his 80s, so I don't know if he's going to want to use the car duster (it's rather heavy), but I find it easy to use and can now clean his car for him without wasting a lot of water. The small duster is great for the dash and small areas."
5,Better than I ever could've imagined!,"So I was skeptical in buying this series because I caught a random episode once or twice and it just didn't seem right. Once watching the dvds I understood why... this is one of the best serialized dramas I've EVER seen, and I'm not usually a fan for serialized dramas. You can't watch an episode somewhere in the middle... it leaves you feeling lost and out of the loop. Much like Buffy, only grounded more in the real world it's the perfect show for any viewer. Each episode is equally as important as the one preceding it as well as the one following... it provides satisfaction and answers while also leaving a slight bit of mystery making the viewer want more. This is by far one of the best shows in modern television and I'd highly recommend it."
5,An unique show...,"A teen show, yes and no. A film noir show, yes but not only. Definitely, Veronica Mars borrows from various genres, but somehow successfully managed to captive one's attention when watching the first few episodes. Suspense, tongue-in-cheek humor, investigation, if you like all of this you should really consider discovering what Neptune's people have to hide. A must buy for the fans, a remorseless acquisition for anyone who likes quality television.Note the DVDs are compatible with Zone 2 (Europe, Japan)."
1,be aware!!!!,I only downloaded 15 songs instead 150 songs like they said. It had error occurred at song 15th
4,Lots of songs I had forgotten all about!,"The selection of songs in this album is excellent and brought me back to my childhood! My only criticism is not the occasional sour notes (they are KIDS after all--and very talented kids at that), but that one of the singers has a lisp. You will hear a few songs like ""Thkip to my Lou"" and ""Yellow Rothe of Texthath"". I know it's not the poor kid's fault, but I also don't want my kids to start to imitate the lisp they hear in some of these songs. I'll be looking for alternate versions of some of these songs for that reason, but the majority of the songs are this album are great (the kid with the lisp is the lead singer in only a few of the songs)."
2,Annoying,I bought this beacause it seemed like a great deal. The songs are sung by really annoying kids and my daughter asked me to turn the music off.
3,Its okay,"Its okay, compared to Dora explorer party favs, this is inferior, bought it just because it has lot of songs, havent listened some of them before.."
3,The songs are a little bit off,"Although my daughter loves the music, for me, many of these songs are just hard to listen to due to lyric differences, tempo changes, and even different melodies. I know everyone wants to make songs ""their own"" but these are childhood classics that need only be sung, not rewritten. Some examples are ""Peas Pudding"" rather Peas Porridge and ""Ring A Ring A Rosey"" instead of Ring Around the Rosey. It's too much."
1,Too fast and not very easy to listen to,"The songs are sung way too fast. My son likes the few that are able to be understood. They are young kids singing, but way too high in pitch and tone. Not a good choice."
1,A bad album for Jars of Clay,"I found this album extremely boring. Now, I love what Jars of Clay did with their self-titled and Much Afraid. Who We Are Instead does not compare to the past in their lyrics and instrumentation. The first 6 songs I would not listen to in the car because they are so slow, and I will fall asleep. They have a folky/country sound in this album, without the stunning acoustic guitar and rhythm I am used to. I bought As I Left the Zoo and was horribly disappointed. I got this album, and yet again am longing for more. Repetitive lyrics, twangy sound-- I give this album 1/5 stars."
2,Disappointed,"I am a big fan of ""Jars of Clay"" and was in the habit of purchasing any new CD that would come out by these artists, without even a preview. I find them multi-talented and find their music to be uplifting as well as inspiring. I love their angel voices and their music. I bought the CD ""Who we are instead"" and I was most disappointed. The style, format, all were unlike their usual style of music. I hope that these wonderfully talented men will go back to style of music that many of us have been drawn to. I am not in the habit of making unfavorable comments however I felt led to share this personal insight."
3,It's just not as good as everyone else says it is,"No No No! It's not their best album. Every other review I've read here reckons this is a brilliant album. I'm not going to tell you not to buy it - but I will say it is far short of their best.That said there are some good songs - Sunny Days, Amazing Grace and Jealous Kind. These are good poppy tunes that the Jars of Clay are so good at.""Trouble is"" is a cross between that song from ""Brother where art thou"" and Fade in/out by Oasis. It's really not inventive and a bit tiresome.The rest of the songs can get pretty boring. For my mind the high point was If I left the Zoo - songs like Famous last words and unforgetful you were just amazing. Who we are instead is nowhere near as poppy. Only time will tell which of the 6 albums turns out to be the one I go back to time and time again. But for now I go back to albums 1, 2 and 3 the most and I really have to say that I was a bit disappointed by this album."
4,No more head banging. . .,"When I first listened to the first Jars CD, I loved it. I did not however realize how boisterous it was until I saw them in concert. All the kids were banging their heads and flailing around! The musicianship was so fantastic, that I did not even hear that in the music until I saw it.That being said, there will be no ""head banging"" to this album. The album is much mellower and fairly melancholy. The music is good, but it is definitely not the same. I hope this is an experiment and not a new direction. I still yearn for that rocked-up lead violin!Jars fans will like the album because it is Jars. If you are new to Jars, I highly recommend the first ""JARS OF CLAY"" album."
1,This is NOT Jars of Clay...,"Honestly, when I first played this cd, I thought to myself, ""Who on earth is THIS?"" This is NOT the Jars that we know. I'm not sure if they decided to go country, or if they all suddenly got depressed, but this cd is awful in comparison to their earlier releases. I truly am disappointed; they used to have this fantastic harmonizing/slightly edgy sound that was really moving. This cd is mostly ballads and songs I'd rather not listen to. I guess I'll just have to stick with Much Afraid and their first release. Sorry, Jars, but honestly, what happened?"
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"Quite honestly the best Christian album I've ever heard, and one of the best albums period. The strikingly powerful, sometimes painfully introspective lyrics ""Built another temple to a stranger... Gave away my heart to the rushing wind"", accompanied by equally introspective acoustic blues fills the listener with gut-wrenching sorrow and uplifting joy, all equally applicable for the drive to work as well as relaxing before bed. Just wonderful. I'm buying this for everyone in my family."
5,A Complete Surprise,"Ever since a friend gave me a copy of their self-titled album back in 1995, I've been a fan. I LOVED Much Afraid, loved most of If I Left the Zoo, and was not impressed by the majority of The Eleventh Hour. I just saw them in concert at the beginning of this month (soulFest in New Hampshire) and was amazed that they had some new songs that were GOOD. So I bought this album and Redemption Songs.Show You Love is my favorite song on the album. It's cachy, sweet, and VERY Jars. If you liked their Much Afraid album, you'll love this song. The chorus is I'm gonna show you love in every language/I'm gonna speak with words that need no form/I'm gonna give you what you never had before. Dan's poetic lyrics merge so well with the music.Sunny Days has to be my second favorite... it's got a nice hook.The whole album is pleasnt to listen to in general, and I'd put it up there with their first 2 albums."
5,Jealous Kind- best song on the album!,"The whole album is fantastic, but ""Jealous Kind"" is the best. I love their lyrics, and the talent of the combination of words and music is inspiring..."
4,"Wonderful, but...","I have to admit I am a big fan of Jars of Clay. Their lyrics are so honest, deep, and effective to me. Their musical style is also right up my alley, simplistic oddity. Although ""Jars of Clay,"" their debut, is a classic, it isn't my favorite. My personal opinion is that their best album remains ""If I Left The Zoo.""One thing that kind of is irking me about Jars is the tendency they have to write melancholy songs. Don't get me wrong, they do it oh so bittersweetly! It's great when you're in the mood or feeling the same sentiments. But their leaning toward the sadder/mopey side of things is getting a little old with me.I think that ""Who We Are Instead"" is on my 'best Jars CDs' list. Despite its return to the heavyhearted nature of past albums, it is very catchy and a good listen. There are slight and miniscule hints of gritty country-ish sounds in some songs and I like it.I would say that if you consider yourself a fan this album is definitely necessary to your collection."
2,Back to Rock!!!PLEASE!!!,"I don't ever like dissing a good band and that is exactly what Jars of Clay are, besides being class acts they have made some great music, enjoyable to all people. But this acoustic/mellow/folk thing has to go. I commend them for trying something new, but the majority of this CD is boring, i like only 3 songs. The single ""lonely people"" was an excellent song and would fit well on a typical rock album as a taste of something different. The lyrics ""taste the silver cup... Ride that highway in the sky"" seem kind of empty though. All in all im sure some would love this disc, but i was HUGE fan of the eleventh hour and want that rock, aggressive style back. Just one guy's opinion though!"
5,Another advance for Jars,"This CD is even better than the self titled release. For anyone who was disapointed with the 11th hour, this CD takes away all the pain. It's unique with its great blend of techniques with a tiny bit of bluegrass flair (please, no one be turned off by this, I did not say that it is twangy) The messages are as good as ever, just look at the lyrics to ""jealous kind"". This is a truly unique and beautiful cd. Jars has advanced and there isn't a song on it that isn't worthwhile."
4,What happened to my first Review?!,"Reviewed this movie at length once already.... I am looking forward to more Rarescope releases based on this first purchase. A serious positive (for me) is that it is in the orginally Mandarin format (with subtitles). It misses five stars by a hair (slow in parts), but is definitely worthy of purchase. I think the first reviewer already did a nice job - so I will second his opinions here..."
1,Junk. Extremely hard to assemble.,"All the parts were there, thats about all the good I have to say about this mess of a drawer. Cheap? Yes! Very poor instructions? Absolutely! A mess to assemble? Darn right! I assemble a lot of mail order furniture and this little drawer has been one of the most awful to deal with. Directions make so sense. Drawings are not accurate. Basically its hit and miss. And after assemble is painfully completed, the drawer is very noisy to operate, metal scraping against metal, and not sturdy at all, plus very ugly. Usually drawer slider guides are plastic coated for quiet operation, but not these sliders. Spend a little more and get something, anything else."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"on this book, unless you wish to follow the mindless politically correct rewritten version of history that you find pretty much everywhere these days. I am a teacher, a historian, and a woman whose ancestors fought proudly for the Union Army. That said, I recognize this book for what it is. If you're really looking for something historically accurate, then you would better spend your money on books which detail - even for this age group - the War Between the States in much more realistic and honest terms. They are out there. Though I'm not quite as passionate as some of the reviewers below, I agree with their sentiment entirely. This book is simply fluff with almost no historical value - actually, it's worse than that, because it does perpetuate false stereotypes. It's especially bad because it's done in the guise of educational fiction. Shame on Scholastic."
1,From a Yankee Teacher,"This is 1 Yankee who really knows her history! I am teacher in NY state and when I took a look at this book in the library, I wasn't too pleased. Rhode Island had more slaves than any other state! Next, the South did not want to secede b/c they wanted to keep slaves, but because they thought they were being taxed unfairly. Northerners didn't give a damn about slaves, and some Northerners kept slaves as well.Lincoln even used the issue of enslavement to gain popularity for the Union to make the Confederate states look bad. ""If I could save the nation by freeing all the slaves I would do it, and if I could save the nation without freeing any slave I would do it"" ~ Abraham Lincoln"
1,Do Not Buy This Book,This book is nothing but propaganda. The author either believes this baloney and did no research at all or did research the subject an chose to deliberately misrepresent the truth. There are enough lies and deception in the world without paying good money for a book which deceives children about the truth of the War Between the States. Scholastic should be ashamed for publishing such a book.
1,"Bigoted, Biased Ballyhoo!","I would really like to know if Ms. Moore actually believes what she wrote, or simply did it for the money. Either way, the book is shameful and filled with inaccuracies, inuendo, half-truths and fabrications. If You Lived at the Time of the Civil War is a shining example of Political Correctness at its finest. Don't waste your money."
1,"Garbage In, Garbage Out","Probably the worst of his solo works to date. The Demon needs to go back to his early KISS roots and find himself! I've been a large fan of KISS since '76 and stayed with them through the 80's. I think Gene and company lost their way though some 10+ years ago. And this solo is proof. I didn't expect a ""KISS"" album here, but shame on you Gene, for scraping the bottom of the barrel on this one. Probably why we haven't seen any solo work from you in the past 5 years. Abysmal!"
3,Branching Out,"This is much different than any of Gene's previous solo or Kiss stuff. I give him credit for trying some different styles. However, some of them work and some don't. Fans of Gene Simmons will like this album, but those who are not fans will not be won over on this effort."
1,"It's over Gene, face it you ahole",What a waste of time and effort. What are you thinking?You invented Kiss!! for Goodness sakes. Your making a mockery of the band and your self. Don't bother with this one folks.
1,Gene Simmons - The Retard Sessions,"How could one describe this album? Well, for starters, we can remind ourselves how much Gene Simmons mocked the 78 solo album effort by former band mate Peter Criss. Then we can put this cd in and ask ourselves if this guy is serious.. Let us conclude by saying that Gene puts no effort into the vocals on this album whatsoever.. he sings through his nose most of the time and sounds like a flat old man. The music sounds like Gene hired a bunch of wasted hippies off the street who just banged and slammed out some crappy chords. And the background vocals, well.. they sound like a bunch of retards screeching and moaning behind the rest of the jumbled mess. It was Gene who said that there was a sucker born every minute and I think this album was put out just to turn a quick buck from the suckers who bought it. This album must have been thrown together in a week or less and then flung out into the market.. and I must say, the crappy rush job shows in the final product."
1,This sounds like it came from his A**hole !!!,"I've heard better flatulance !! This album is just awfull. Definatly not a KISS album. I can't tell if he's trying to make political statments, getting ready for a Vegas career, or getting ready to write songs for Britney Spears. On one song I think he's even trying to rap!! I'm hoping I can sell back my CD before word of this record gets out."
3,Not horrible...it's Gene,"It's not anywhere close to being a masterpiece, but truly, this disc represents Gene's effort to be contemporary. ""The Family Jewels"" television show garnered a new young audience and so this album is a logical next step. I'm certain that if KISS had a tv show they would record an album of new material..There are newer, younger bands that sound like this and they are praised as the next big thing!! Personally I think 90% of the new rock sucks so if I'm going to hear this kind of stuff I'd rather hear it froma proven artist."
4,Could be better.,"This is a damn good album. But it could've kicked ass. A**Hole is an odd album. I think Gene was trying to be more modern. But that's not how people like him. They like the 1977 toungue wagging, bloob spitting, fire breathing demon. Don't get me wrong this is still a good listen but i was disappointed. But the title track is great. Black toungue is also a great track. But most of the songs on this album aren't very catchy. You should buy it but don't put it at the top of your list. I suggest his 1978 solo effort. Now that's a frigin good album!"
3,Could have been better.,"KISS has been my favorite band for the past 13 years. This cd to me is very boring. Its not a bad cd it just seemed like Gene rushed to put it out. The lyrics are boring and the video for Firestarter is such a joke, Gene is now a Demon/Pimp Daddy. I think Genes version of Firestarter is better than the orginal by Prodigy. I would have to say the low points of the cd are ""Weapons of mass destruction"" & ""Dog"". The high points are ""Waiting For the Morning Light"", ""A**hole"", ""1,000 Dreams"", and ""Firestarter""."
4,Eclectic...Interesting...Fun.,"If you are entertained by music (and a KISS fan would help), this is a good listen. Nothing memerable, just a good listen. It would be a must have clearance disk but its probably not for most people. I Loved It."
4,Gene is rockin and rollin',"All I got to say about this CD is WHHHOOAAA! Man does this thing blow the covers off your speakers. It is a collection of new and heavy rock, something Kiss need to do. If Kiss want to look to a sound for a new CD this is it! Buy this, its awesome."
1,HELP,Gene isn't a songwriter... no kidding! You can tell that just by listening to his interviews. He can't even talk!!! Guaranteed that the only people that bought this CD are total trash people that live in trailer parks.
1,Give it up,"Fortunately I got this CD used. I would be terribly upset if I paid full price for this. Gene the demon, you bet. This is the CD that will be played in **ll. This is torture. Skeet shooting anyone? 2 possibly 3 fairly decent songs. The rest is pure drivel."
1,Bloody awful.,"I'm a big fan of Kiss, but I'm frequently irked by Simmons constant slating of former Kiss members Criss and Frehley. Frehley had his problems, but he is a great guitarist and penned some of Kiss's best songs.I'm afraid Gene, I would compare the music that on this album to the subtance that comes out of a..holes. Infantile, second rate rubbish.At the moment I'm listening to Greatest Hits Live by Mr Ace Frehley. Sorry mate, but Ace leaves you in the starting blocks.Avoid at all costs"
1,"Gene, Gene, Gene...","Where can I start about this cd? First of all it sounds like Gene did the album in 24 hours. Second of all he is trying to be current. Third all Gene wants is a BUCK! I LOVE KISS! To me they are the greatest rock n roll band ever (beside Led Zeppelin). But Genes new solo album seems like all he wants is to make more, more, and more money. That man trys to do anything just for a buck. Now don't get me wrong, I love Gene, but he needs to start focusing on the music again instead of the money."
1,poop,this is trash by any set of standards. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.i wish i could vote 0 stars. oh by the way the album is dirt and gene simmons is a greedy and sad man.
2,Crotch Creature,A couple of songs on this Cd are OK but most are pretty bad. Come on crotch creature- find some new themes to write about. Why you gots to be so raunchy crotch creature? I aksed my friend but he gave up on you a long time ago.
5,PRETTY GOOD SOLO EFFORT!!!!!!!,"I have been a huge kiss fan for 7 years and at first I wasn't expecting Gene Simmons second solo album to be any good. I was wrong. Sure its not a kiss Album but it's still a great solo effort by the demon himself. The best tracks on the album are A** Hole, Firestarter, and Sweet & Dirty Love, but all the songs are great. If you are a fan of kiss or gene go and get it. Also check out Paul Stanley solo album coming out later this year."
1,Stupid.,"For being one of the founding members of Kiss, this album is a disgrace. Gene has become a parody of himself. With his arrogance, I expected him to at least make some good music. His self righteousness is causing his music to seriously suck. I hope he gets 4600 rotten eggs thrown on his head for this loose stool."
1,Disappointing effort,"This CD has poor sound quality and the songs aren't that good. I'm a Kiss fan. I was not expecting a Kiss album, but I was at least expecting a professional recording. Don't waste your money. This CD is truly an insult to Kiss and Gene Simmons' fans. It's not even worth downloading for free."
1,What Will You Call Yourself After Buying This?,"Simmons has written some great music, unfortunatley for him (& the Kiss fan) most of it was on Kiss's first 5 albums. If you are a Kiss fan expecting anything remotely close to the ""classic"" (that means with Ace) Kiss sound you will be past disappointed and on the way to thoroughly p$ssed for dropping $$$$ on this. If you are a Diehard KISS fan, I mean Kiss Army material from the 70's stay far far away. If you are interested in hearing what Gene has to offer, my advice is to wait a few more months and go to zShops where there will be plenty available for under $1."
1,Be very afraid,I give this CD 1 star only because Zero is not an option. This is a typical Gene Simmons piece of junk product that he clearly spent more time on the marketing of this album than on making sure that he had a quality product to market.The self proclaimed genius has failed.....again.Gene owes it to the FANS not to release junk.
1,Firestarter Rocks! The rest is lame,"I say the song ""Firestarter"" is a classic great song, but 1 song doesnt make an album, the rest is just loud trash.But the one song ""Firestarter"" is better than ALL of the songs on th new KiSS album ""Sonic Boom""."
1,To quote songs from the CD (and I use the word CD loosely),"""If I Had a Gun"" I'd shoot myself if I paid for this CD. I apologize to anyone who bought it, but I think Gene is trying to say if you bought this CD you're an ""A**hole"" and every time you look at the CD, it will remind you of that.A sample of the wonderful, deep and thought provoking lyrics on this ""If I had a gun, I'd have me some fun."" My 2 year old daughter can write better lyrics.I'm VERY disappointed, Demon. :("
1,what do you expect?,"I'm ashamed to say I was once a very big fan of Kiss. Gene Simmons is the reason I'm now ashamed of that fact. If you've bothered to watch any of the interviews or monitor Gene's activities over the past six years, you know that he's made it blatantly obvious that he cares about one thing only, and that is taking other people's money. He put this album out knowing that enough die-hard Kiss fans would buy it to put some more money in his pocket. He doesn't care about the fans, and obviously never has. He's taken what was once my childhood inspiration and reduced it to a crude reference to the human anatomy. Thanks, Gene. Your selfishness has made me appropriately suspicious in this day and age."
2,Gene $immons,"If you're a Gene Simmons fan, you have to know what you're gonna get as far as a solo record goes; a big, egocentric mess of an album. To me, this one has the same vibe as his first solo album in 78'...it's just Gene being Gene. If you want to hear strong songwriting from Gene, listen to the first few records or Creatures of the Night. It is what it is. I have a feeling Paul's solo album will be a lot stronger."
1,Truely made me ill,"Wow. I borrowed this CD from my brother, who found it used for like $2. I knew it was going to be bad, but I could not possibily have imagined how bad. I'll be right back.... I have to vomit."
2,"Hey Gene, No more solo albums, just stay in the Brothel","well at least the album cover is cute , because the songs on this are aweful. I was so disapointed by Gene's solo album. I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the KISS albums. So my expectations were minimal at best, but I at least expected to like it.This album is so bad that I found myself wondering if Gene himeself ever listen to it before he put it out. I mean this album is embarassing.I did like the title track. Bit the rest of the album was a disaster.this album isn't artistic, it isn't inspiring, and most of all it isn't even any good.In the mid-to-late 1980's Ace Frehley embarked on a solo career with his band called ""Frehley's Comet"" that was rediculed by Gene Simmons. Although Frehley's comet wasn't all that bad, they weren't really great either. But as mediocre as Frehley's Comet was, Gene's album is so bad that it makes Ace Frehley's Comet look like Devine Greatness."
2,"Not so bad at all, but very uneven..","I agree with the reviewer who said that this album apparently was put together in a rush. It's very uneven and has some weird choice of songs.Anyway, if one puts aside all the JUSTIFIED prejudice against this self-proclaimed greedy and nasty man, at least we'll see that he did not try to release a KISS album, but an album with a lot of differente material. More often than not, the result was a tragedy, but a few good tracks survived here. Nothing enough, be advised, to spend your money on it!"
2,"A**hole, smells like s**t to me.","WOW, what a sorry excuse for an album. Gene is clearly out of control. The $ sign has taken control of this once rock legend. Now let me say, I am a HUGE KISS fan. I had the honor of seeing KISS on the first farewell tour with Ace and Peter, front row center. However, much like KISS of today, this album is nothing like what KISS was in the 70's. Gene needs to take off the make up, hang up the bass, and spend his time counting his money, and staring at Ms. Tweed."
1,genes cocky ego strikes again!,"worthless album! everything on here is a complete waste of time,no wonder kiss is putting out such lame albums these days,gene is way to obsessed with himself!"
3,Just a comment,"According to the notes about all the songs from this album on youtube, the only songs that Gene actually wrote the music to are ""Sweet And Dirty Love"", ""Weapons Of Mass Destruction"", ""Now That You're Gone"", and ""Carnival Of Souls"". Besides ""Now That You're Gone"", those are really the only good songs on the album, in my opinion."
1,Time to hang it up.,"Poor singing, poor sound quality. I'm a Kiss fan, but I have to be honest. This is one of the worst performances I've ever heard. Gene's solo album from 1978 blows this one away. Gene's a good business man, but he is exposed as a musical fraud. I think I'll save my money for Paul Stanley's solo album. Maybe Paul will record his in a real studio instead of a cheap tape recorder. Very disappointing."
2,I can wait another 24 years for the next Gene cd.,"Bottom line- this is NOT Gene's best work. I think he released this as an ""experimental"" cd. I liked the title track but that was it. The rest is garbage. I'll be looking forward to a new cd from ACE FREHLEY!"
4,Rubber Mask,"The mask looks pretty good overall, but it's really hard to breathe. The only ventilation is through the opening where you look through. If you're thinking of wearing this to a costume party, it's pretty tough to breathe or drink, but the look is right."
3,Still funny but the weakest season by far.,"I loved seasons 1-4, but thought season 5 fell short of Curb's general greatness.I still laughed hard and often,but much of the comedy was too over the top,even for Curb.Some of the improvised acting by the secondary characters,especially by Kevin Nealon and Richard Lewis was awful.Even Larry seemed out of place at times,but usually still had me rolling on the floor laughing profusely.Though,Jeff Garlin,Cheryl Hines,Wanda Sykes,Ted Dansen and Larry's Dad(in the show)are still top-notch and virtually flawless as always.The last episode was pretty much god-awful,with the cameos by Dustin Hoffman and Sacha Baron Cohen(Tv's Ali G) being more annoying than good.This is still worth buying or renting,due to the many hilarious scenes in every episode!GRADE:BDVD EXTRAS:The two extra featurettes(28 minutes each)are fine but nothing special.Still,it's always good to hear from the cast and many interesting things are discussed.Grade:C+"
3,Still funny,"Larry's creativity in setting up new situations for funny mishaps shows in this season. However, I do think that some of the scenarios were so over the top that I struggled to relate as much to this season. Part of the ""It's gold Jerry"" of CYE is seeing how Larry disregards social norms in some of the typical situations in which we all find ourselves. If you are a fan, I think you will enjoy Season 5 and find it interesting. If you are new to the series, you might start with some of the earlier seasons first. As a disclaimer, I should say I have only watched these episodes once, so the above are only first impressions."
2,It's Ran It's Course...,"It pains me to say this, but I think Larry David's clamouring for storylines here.I'm a huge fan, and maybe I was caught up in all of the rave reviews I've read elsewhere, but I feel massively let-down.Having said that, I've only watched the first three episodes, but there hasn't been a single laugh-out-loud moment for me so far... Just the occasional chuckle at Larry's 'incidents'. But even then, it's a little bit obvious when the punchlines come.What I'd give for another episode like the one where he gets his managers daughter drunk; 'I thought she had a speech impediment.' Or the episode where Larry finds out his mum's dead... Pure comedy genius.I see nothing of that here, I'm afraid."
3,Curb Your Enthusiasm,"I'm a huge fan of CYE, but I've got to say that series five is the beginning of the end for me. The situations are becoming weaker and less plausible and are only ever resovled with childish bickering or plain shouting. Cheryl is constatntly sour-faced; its difficult to understand why she stays with Larry. Generally, the whole show feels very angry, often for no good reason.I think the best CYE series offered a window not only into Larry's home life, but the LA TV/ film community as a whole. Without the star cameos and plotllines, CYE now feels a lot like any other family-based sitcom."
2,A Big Bowl of Wrong,"This is the season where it all goes off the tracks. The subtle genius of the previous seasons is out the window. It was to Season 1-4 what the Mad TV sketch was to CYE in general. Larry almost ceases to be a human being in Season 5. He's not just insensitive, or refuses to suffer fools gladly, he's socially retarded. He does things that no SANE person-- not merely no politically correct person-- would do. In previous years, he's the one who's put upon at least half the time, here, it's over the top self parody of a guy with the social graces of a warthog. There are about 2 episodes funny enough to make seasons 1-4, the rest just don't work. They have a certain can't take your eyes off the train wreck quality, however."
1,Still Has Not Arrived...,"I ordered this dvd on November 4th. Now more than a month later it has still not arrived and ""the two fifty"" has not responded to my inquiry. As far as the DVD itself the fifth season of Curb is one of the best."
1,Worst show ever - do NOT be fooled by the 5-star reviews!,"This is the worst show ever produced - taking advantage of Seinfeld fans misguided loyalty, and the wrongful thought, that since this is made by Larry Davis, it has to be good... it don't!After a couple of episodes (if you actually get this deep into it before throwing away the dvd's) you realise that the dialogue actually follows the same structure and speech patterns that Seinfeld does - only this show has no proper actors or comedians to deliver the lines.It's stiff, slow, tries to hard but keeps on failing, annoying, embarrassing and quite frankly a disaster.I have no idea who these guys are that gives this 5 stars, but they have to be family of Larry's.I bought the entire series based on the stupid 5 star reviews and the fact that I too thought that 'Larry Davis, this can only be good' - but I've had to through the dvd's out without even seeing all the episodes.Waste of time and money!!!"
5,great adult humor,"I'm a huge fan of the series...enjoyed it immensely...would highly recommend it to others that are into ""adult"" humor."
5,I have a system!,"Yes, it may not be the funniest season although I laughed my butt off every episode! I love this season for taking on the big issues of life, death and self-sacrifice in such a brilliant way.It's a thin tightrope to walk when dealing with matters of religion and people's perceptions of death in a comedic way. Larry walks that rope fearlessly and deftly.The last episode itself is worth 5 stars! I kept expecting it be resolved with the old ""it was all a dream"" contrivance. I should have known Larry was better than that.Ignore the critics, Mr. David. Please don't stop raising the bar and making your fans laugh their butts off! You are truly brilliant!"
5,Curb Season 5 just gets Better and Better,"Curb Your Enthusiasm the complete 5th season is one the funniest of them all. They all are funny, however there are some very funny episodes in this season. The Bowtie, The Christ Nail, Kamakazi Bingo, The Sedar, The Ski Lift The Korean Bookie and The End. The weakest one which I thought would be 100 perect better than it was the Smoking Jacket. When Larry goes to the playboy Hugh Hefner Mantion. Could have been funnier. That episode was probably one of the worst of the whole series. They have an untitled featuree on this DVD i wonder what it is. Curb is still the funniest show out there. Never get sick of it!!! Watch it over and over own all 4 years on DVD.."
5,Curb,I love this show...Larry David has hit a cord with many viewers. It is a fantastic look into life. Great characters and lessons to be learned by all who watch
3,just ok,"I love Larry and was really, really excited for the fifth season, but i must say that i was a bit disappointed. There are definitely a lot of great moments in the season, but i felt it was, overall, just ok. Seasons 1 and 4 were far superior. My major points of aggravation were the lack of explanation for Richard Lewis's very sudden illness and Cheryl's attitude during the entire season, especially the last episode. I know that Larry is ridiculous but she was unusually angry the whole time. But those are just my thoughts."
5,Curb - Season Five,"Curb Your Enthusiasm from Season One to Season Six has just been too funny. We usually watch two shows in sequence and find ourselves begging Larry not ""to do that"" or ""don't go there, Larry."" Great entertainment but you have to be tolerant about the language."
3,Peter's Collection of Primary Sources Only Partial,"While this collection of chronicles of the First Crusade from primary sources is certainly valuable, it is limited by the fact that the editor has chosen to include only those sources that have already been translated, thus leaving many other valuable and informative accounts absent. As many of the chroniclers' accounts possess bias and errors, or were written secondhand or after events had taken place, only a reading of all the primary sources offers the reader the chance to sift and attempt to reassemble events through comparison. In this regard John France's book ""Victory in the East,"" while a secondary retelling from a largely military perspective, perhaps offers greater value.Certainly a must for any scholar of the period, but likely to tire the ordinary or casual reader. This printing is further marred by a flimsy binding that falls apart before one can complete the reading."
3,SAVE THE LAST DANCE VERSION,"Great song..... but does anyone know where I can get the mix version as featured in the film ""Save the Last Dance""??????? unfortunately ithe mix is not on either of the soundtrack albums released from the film. Any ideas ?"
5,Highly recommended text on mortality among the elderly,Dr. Donahue writes an instant classic that belongs in any library devoted to mortality among the elderly. It is extremely well written and does a fantastic job of actually explaining the the uses and misuses of socioeconomic status of mortality among the elderly compared to other authors. Koodos to Donahue for writing this. I am anxiously awaiting the sequel he keeps promising to write!
5,A definate 5 star hit!,"At last a book that not only is fun, but also motivates you to recognize and get off that dead horse and take charge of your life. I agree, it is cheaper than prozac, and quicker than therapy. I have recognized myself in this book. I loved reading and will re-read this book. Thank you Lynn."
1,Rambling Junk,I picked this book up (for free... thank god !!)and ATTEMPTED to get through it. The author rambles through the chapters like she is drunk walking down the street. It would be clear to anyone who actually read it...this book should not have been writen at all... The dead horse analogy is somewhat cute but not much thought went into this one...Don't waste your time...
3,Not my favorite,"This is one of two redhead books I bought. I liked the other one much better (Redheads by Uwe Ditz). For me, this one was too artsy and soft-porny with nudity shots. I wanted something I could put on my coffee table, that I would be OK with having Grandma thumb through. This was not that book."
4,works great!,am carrying two kayaks with this. especially like the front and rear tie-downs that come with it.
5,"works great, kayaks stay on","Just FYI, you can put two kayaks on with only one rack, as long as you buy some extra straps for the second boat. I bought two, since we have two kayaks, but only needed one. That said, I did need the second set of straps, ropes, and hooks. When we eventually buy two more boats (total of 4), I will only need to buy some extra straps and we will be all set."
1,way too difficult with a SUV,Impossible to do this by yourself with 2 kayaks on anu suv without a ladder or running boards. Horrible design
4,"3/16"" crown staples","This size is not available in Lowes, Home Depot, TrueValue, Ace, WalMart..... The stapler is no longer obsolete thanks to the availability and price of staples at Amazon."
1,Worst...Pchem book...ever,"Just finished a 2 sem course in Pchem. Professor assigned this book, but never used it for his lectures, except to make the test questions. I think he purposely chose all of the questions that were worked out wrong, just to frustrate us. He didn't have to look hard to find erroneous questions, the chapters are full of them. The book offered no information to help understand the lectures. As I study for the ACS final, I find that none of the concepts ACS presents are covered in this book in a manner that is useful. I would venture that any P chem book on the market is better than this one. Heck, even Wikipedia is better at teaching Pchem than this waste of trees. If you are assigned this book for a class, (sorry) find another one (book or class)."
2,PChem for Dummies,"If you're lost in a sea of tears and dispair because you don't understand PChem, Ball offers you the easiest book there is on Earth to finally get going somewhere. THE PROBLEMS:-there are a lot of mistakes and typos in this book (be sure to attend your classes and asses with your professor your understanding),-the topics are treated so superficially that the word ""understand"" shouldn't be used (if your professor recommends this one is because he doesn't want you to be a competent professional or because he will trow a lot of the rest in class).The end of chapter problems... are a wonder: easier than opening the book. THE PROBLEM:- no self-respected professor on earth will ever use these for exams (once you got them go for the classics: Laidler, Levine, Castellan or Atkins).WHO SHOULD BUY THIS BOOK: anyone who has already failed to pass the course (believe me, if you find this one hard... well... there could be other majors for you to explore)."
2,no real strategies,"The author simply lists some common sense things people do, but never gives any unique ideas or strategies."
3,The quality of sound is excellent compared to a tape,However other manufactures of mini discs have provided better quality products at cheaper prices. The discs did skip in places even on the first playing and i felt that this was poor for a mini disc - i'll stick to my old brand.
5,Excellent phone for home office.,Unit is very flexible and easy to use. I am very happy with its features. It replaced a previous model that I had in my office.
2,broken,"Please take into consideration this phone is 4 years old. But the buttons have stopped working, no speaker, no caller ID, nothing in the buttons work. Also if you only have one line the line 2 light will always stay lit as if the line is dead and you always have a displya saying check line 2, there is no way to remedy this. I never was too happy with this, so I'm now looking for another speaker phone and it wont be meridian/aastra"
2,Battery Life is Bad,"On the good side, its one of the few two-line cordless phone answering machines I could find for a reasonable prince. And, the handset is comfortable to use -- not too big, not too small. However, the battery life is bad. I've had the phone for a year, and just put the third replacement battery in. Within two or three months, the battery will be worn out to the point that it will give me a low battery signal when I've been talking for 1/2 hour or less. And (presumably because they need to be replaced so often), I have had difficulty finding the replacements - even on the Panasonic website. I am going to replace this phone soon. Avoid it."
3,Good Phone ... but the battery life is bad.,"I bought this phone, great reception,but the battery life is bad, in one year I change 2 times the battery."
2,Stock up on extra replacement batteries!,"A friend of mine bought this phone and raved about it. So, I purchased the same one. I had to return the phone within two days of purchase because I thought the phone had a defect. The low battery - recharge alert beeped almost every time I was on the phone for more than one hour, even if the phone had just been sitting on the charger for ten+ hours. So, I brought the phone back and got another {same model and such - remember, I thought it was a product defect}. Needless to say, I ran into the same problem with the new replacement phone. The battery life on the KX-TG2593B is way BELOW expectations. The other problem has to do with the delete function on the answering system. If you hit the delete button accidently while listening to a message, the message is GONE. There is no way to retrieve it again."
4,I love this phone!,"I have gone through a lot of cordless phones in my house. They start to get less and less battery life until I replace the battery (which doesn't really fix the problem). This phone, which I purchased for work use, works wonderfully!!! I have even dropped it a couple of times and it still keeps on ticking. The best feature is the belt clip and headset jack for hands-free phone use. I can just clip this sucker on my belt and wander around my house to talk. The only down side is that it only has about 3 hours of battery life if you use it constantly. And you can not use the headset while it is charging, so that leaves you with the only option being to use the speaker phone. But for the durability it shows, I've been very happy with the phone."
2,Not Panasonic's Best,"Positives? Good cordless sound quantity even at greater distances.Negatives? The mic on the speaker-phone is reported as sounding like I'm speaking through a long tunnel, there is no MUTE on the speaker-phone, battery talk-time is only about 90 to 120 minutes daily, and saving numbers into the directory is much hardware than their older single-line cordless phones."
4,Useful and Readable Review of Composition Theory,"I have found this book to be well received by students preparing to teach HS English classes, as well as people already in the classroom. It covers thoroughly all the major aspects of composition theory in a succint and careful way, with lots of examples and good bibliography. For anyone who really wants to know what we have learned from comp theory in the last 25 years, this is a good book. It is not a how-to, and does not offer detailed ideas for the classroom; it is based on principles and research."
2,Simple,"The problem with this book is that it takes a fairly simple approach to teaching writing, even though teaching writing is quite complicated and difficult. Also, the book doesn't say enough about ESL writers or writers with dialects. Finally, I couldn't find any discussion of the fact that writing skills in our schools have declined even as research in writing has increased. Overall, I would say that this is a ""feel-good"" book that doesn't address the hard issues of writing instruction."
2,Not for OSX 10.4,"Worked perfect on a PC but made the Mac freeze up, which is not suppose to happen to a Mac, after about 40% download of the card. Called Crucial and they had no answer."
3,Exellent History,"The author is to be commended for the exellent research on a subject with few primary sources. The downside of this book is that it reads like an acedemic research paper rather than telling the story of a long gone istitution. Not an easy read but very detailed. Anyone truly interested in the old Negro Leagues would find this a very informative book. However if you are interested but would prefer something lighter then I would reccomend Mark Ribowsky's book ""A Complete History of the Negro Leagues"""
3,"Great History, Boring Read","The book opened my eyes to a lot that I never knew about Negro League Baseball. I did not know how many leagues there were and how the players were treated in regards to Major Leagues. I did not know how the leagues were funded etc. There is a lot of good info in this book and there are parts where the story is good. After that it dies and some of it is quite boring, I mean the way Lanctot writes about certain things in dreadul."
5,fuel pump,great priced fuel pump for a old carbureted chevy. i would recommend this fuel pump for a carbureted engine !
4,High quality part,"This pump is extremely high quality. I use it as a feeder pump for a larger, higher-pressure pump and it has more than adequately functioned in that role. Very quiet, also. I would like for it to have removable fittings. Being able to use 45-degree fittings would have made installation much easier in my application."
1,Budget fuel pump review,"This Carter fuel pump looked fairly good when I purchased it 6 months ago. I installed it on my 1979 GMC 4x4 snow plow. The pump worked through the winter as advertised. Just guessing, I would say I used the pickup about 10 times through the winter X 1 hour per use = 10 hours running time. This spring I unhooked the plow and parked the pickup. Next time I went to start the PU (2 weeks later) my trusty GMC would not start. After much checking, I finally realized that this pump had stopped working. Took it off and tested and retested -- it sports an internal rattle (when connected to 12 volt DC) and it no longer sucks. The pump is 'kaput', no doubt about it. For me, this pump was a bad investment."
3,I've heard better from Ken.,"Don't get me wrong, I love Nordine's stuff, this is just old stuff, not quite as impressive as his current work. This is a compilation of some of his stuff from the sixties. He still uses some of the same stories as he currently uses. Still, this is a funny CD, I recomend listening to it. Borrow it from a friend, don't buy it though unless you are a Ken Nordine collector."
3,I liked this,"I'd really give this 3 1/2 stars. I know other reviewers have questioned the way she became pregnant and I'm in two minds about the whole thing. But if you take that out of the equation, I really liked Mitch. The way his paralysis was portrayed, as well as his daily struggle with his braces and crutches was very moving. He was a mature, thoughtful and sensitive hero. I found this difficult to reconcile with the insensitive 'jock' who forced the heroine to have sex with him."
4,"Nice for moulding, but certainly not quiet","No quieter than anything else on the market. However, it has worked flawlessly for various home projects that have included at least 800ft of moulding (floor and crown) and tacking a few 2x4s when building a shed. I used a Hitachi 18ga gun to fire 2inch nails completely flush and clean."
4,Really nice!,I really liked this book. Many of the ideas not only involve different paint finishes but also embellishments. There are many ideas that would be appropriate for teen and kids rooms but many sophisticated looks for the whole house. The directions are not over complicated which I like. This book will give you lots of ideas.
1,A Big Disappointment,This book was a complete disappointment. I expected refined finishes...new and exciting ideas. The finishes in this book would be more appropriate for someone who is interested in crafts. I don't find it to be a great addition to a professional faux finisher's library. It would be helpful for a do-it-yourselfer or a hobbist.
2,Childish,I should have known from the cover that it would be a bit childish. I was hoping for more ideas that could be used for a mature setting.
2,Okay For Fun,"If you just want to play around and don't expect fine finishes or upscale results, this book is fine. So much more is available that I can't see spending the money on this one."
1,Spectacular Walls,"Truley junk, some of the worst finishes I have seen in 23 years of doing decorative painting!"
5,The best case for a quiet build by far,"This is easily the best case on the market for a quiet build. This is my second Antec Solo and if I needed to build another PC, I would not hesitate to buy this case again. Excellent build quality, ingenious noise reduction features (such as the drive suspension mechanism), great insulation (the side panels are beasts, nothing gets through) and great cooling efficiency. As a bonus, it looks amazing! The only issue you could possibly have, that is easily overcome, is if you have a huge graphics card. I have a Radeon HD 4870 which is one of the biggest out there, and with a little smart cable management I was able to fit it in along with two suspended HDDs. Buy this case."
3,Is the design done?,"I would actually give this item 5 stars but only due to Amazon's free delivery. Otherwise, I thought the design for the hard drive(s) for this tower was awkward. I did not understand why elastic straps were placed in the hard drive slot. Had to place my hard drive(s) using another Antec's hard drive plate(s). Other problem I encountered was that the bottom of the tower had nice rubber studs to keep the tower from slipping, but that the studs were placed with two sided tape and not screwed in. I lost one stud already and had no way to place it back in unless I drilled a hole in the bottom and screwed it in along with some washers. One of Antec's designs that needs to be improved. Mine did not have a pamplet to explain the simple things. Quiet only if one uses a nice quiet power supply."
3,"NOT BAD, NOT BAD","A taxi driver, a monk, a D.J., and a supreme being are thrown together into the battle to save earth from Evil, a giant ball of volcanic rock plumeting towards our world.The novelization contains Bisson's usual rich prose, but the mostly visual film doesn't exactly translate all that well to written form.Most of the humor comes from a wacky narrative in the style of Douglas Adams.About half way through the book, extreme differences from the film appear. It makes one wonder if the studio ever updated Bisson on script changes.The story itself is fun. The characters often goofy. But differences from the film somewhat deter our interest.But it's not all that bad."
1,Bad Bad Bad 5th Element Book,I read this book when it came out with the movie. I think it is the worse book I have read in my entire life. Some of the writing was just letter thrown together. There was not real filling out of the characters from the movie nor was there anything to fill out the missing details of the society that the movie is centered around. I have to say that I think that the money I spent on this book was a waste as is the paper it was written on other than what not to do when writing a tie in novel or any novel for that matter. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they need a negative example. Watch the movie a few times or read the script it is online. Hope this helped.
1,Disappointed,"My wife is very disappointed with the New Thesaurus 3rd edition that we purchased it is nothing like the old one that we had, it doesn't have as many words and is totally unsuitable."
2,Too big and bulky!,"This book is huge, and was impossible to keep open for looking at. I was very disappointed,especially considering the price."
2,Not quite what I expected...,"If you are extremely creative you may like this book - essentially you will be designing it yourself. It is quite colorful and well made with nice pockets, however, the pages are completely blank (not a ""fill in the blank"" format where the topic ideas are given). I am a scrapbooker myself but for a ""school years"" book I was hoping for one which combined both blank pages and things to fill in. This is just all blank space."
2,Not worth the money,I ordered 3 for our 3 sons based on the reviews. I personally didn't care for the book. It's blank 3 pages for each grade with 1 pocket. Not worth the money in my opinion. I will be sending mine back.
2,"Nice graphic design, but pages do not lay flat.","I first learned of this ""not meant to be scrapbook"" book in the Sept/October 2003 issue of Simple Scrapbooks magazine. This product could be awesome, but Janis Boehm should attempt to update the size of the book to a 12 x 12 format. Okay, so it was designed in 1997 before 12 x 12 was a standard size. But if the opportunity arises, consider tweaking the design. If all of the original non-12 x 12 books are sold out, considering changing the size between production-runs.I'm impressed with the graphic design of this book, but structurally it could be improved upon to allow the pages to lie flat and to allow for non-side loading page protectors. And I find it curious that something with 60 blank acid free pages is ""not meant to be a scrapbook."""
1,Don't waste your money or your time,"This is a low-quality copy of a horrible film. While I did not expect the picture quality to be pristine by any means, it was terrible throughout the film (although I have to admit the sound was good). And if you were expecting nudity. look elsewhere--there is none here. Not even bad enough to be laughable; just awful."
1,I agree with the other guy -very poor,"The tattered copy of the film makes it unwatchable.Besides that its poorly acted, written and directed - looks like an 8mm home movie found in the attic - dull and unwatchable - especially in its shoddy state.Big disappointment especially after Shanty Tramp by the same director."
1,What a piece of Junk.,"I collect Biker Movies and had this on my wish list for awhile. Read the other reviews and decided to search the web for additional info before I spent my money on the DVD. Found the complete movie on You Tube so watched it. If I liked it I would have purchased it. After watching it I have to say its the worst Biker movie I ever saw. Maybe the worst movie period. Poor acting, very little motorcycle action. Save your money."
3,A rough transfer of a good movie.,"The action in this movie is on par or better then most movies of its time. The story is relatively easy to follow as well. The big problem with this movie is the transfer is really rough and jumpy in some places. In one spot the coloration of the movie goes a little crazy and becomes a greenish yellow and most of the detail is lost. Also lost in many spots are the subtitles. White subtitles on light / white backgrounds are difficult, if not impossible, to read.It's a movie worth owning, but it is also worth waiting for a better transfer to come along."
4,"What will be the fate of this movie now ""Rarescope"" is no more?","Having read of the apparent [recent] collapse of BCI/Eclipse, this movie might languish in this DVD form ONLY,and that's [potentially] a real shame. It deserves to be remastered anew by another company because, as of now, this version is not: 1)anamorphic widescreen, and 2)either digital enhancement of the original subtitles or newly-written subtitles would enhance this movie that is Shaw Brothers in spirit, if not in name. Everyone should email Navarre to put some serious money in a new remastering. If there's this much interest in this flick, then maybe Tarantino could be persuaded to give them a loan of a few million to get the film as close to a Celestial Shaw remastering as possible. Somebody needs to preserve this movie proper for future generations! In the meantime, buy this with caution. (10/31 revision)"
5,Excellent for ONE great reason,"I highly recommend this book to specifically read Chapter 3: Homosexuality is a perversion. At last here is someone who has gathered more than enough evidence to prove the sibling relationship between homosexuality and pedophilia, as well as proving the stupidity of the one who said that 10% of the population is gay. Personally, I despise the word ""homophobic."" It is a stupid word that has no use except to label NORMAL people as killers, and create A LOT of propaganda.Read this chapter to raise your IQ."
2,Interesting but rather nasty,"A fascinating glimpse into the mind set of a fundamentalist Christian. Articulate and fairly well written, as you would expect, and not without some self-deprecating humor (e.g., his one liner about introducing himself as a ""southern baptist preacher"" to squash unwanted in-flight conversations). However the logic behind most of the arguments is breathtakingly twisted and full of non-sequiturs. The title is accurate to be sure, most of these ""truths"" are indeed outrageous. If you already believe these assertions, you will undoubtedly find comfort in Jeffress' arguments. However expounding any of this over the watercooler is unlikely to win any converts. Hard to find much Christian love or compassion anywhere in these pages; so much for loving the sinner, he seems to have as many harsh words for fellow Christians as non-believers (who are all going to hell anyway)."
5,7 Absolutes you can believe in,This is a MUST READ for every Pastor who is tempted to soften his message to avoid offending someone. Forget the sugar and get back to the GOSPEL!
5,HE DID IT AGAIN,TD JAKES HAS DONE IT AGAIN WITH THE SECOND PART OF WOMAN THOU ART LOOSED. I DO THINK THAT THIS ONE IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE.
5,BLAIR NEVER DISAPPOINTS,"First, I thought this was the continuation to the first one, but my God it was so much hold your breath, oh my goodness, get angry, yelling at the movie, questioning why,what is going to happen next so good film.Just when I thought that Blair would be a nice guy, I should have known better.This film is all that and then some and I recommend it with the highest PRAISE!!!!Kudos TD Jakes you did again! :-)"
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!,"Me and momma just watch this movie we really enjoyed it....my momma was moved too tears, cause it showed her entire neighborhood she grew up in from New Orleans Gertown in the house! The cast was great and you can see how this could really happen!! I was truly pleased with the drama and the intense of it! I love when Blair play a bad boy!!!! I highly recommend this film!!!!!"
1,Don't buy,"I am all for supporting Christian productions but this was just bad. Poor plot, bad cinematography and just not properly developed storyline with no links.. It was just bad.."
4,Mised this inthe theatre,This movie was very entertaining. Love Blair Underwood's performance. He truly needs to be on network tv again..Scandal exec are you listening?. I erroneously thought a digital copy was included was included (should be with every DVD!).
4,loosed,"Enjoy this movie, the ending surprise me, I was so focused on her we didn't look at him. good for you T D Jakes"
5,WOMAN THOU ARE LOOSE 7TH DAY,THIS WAS A EXCELLENT MOVIE. IT WAS INTERESTING FIGURING OUT WHO THE KIDNAPPER WAS. THE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES WAS EXCELLENT.
3,A fine companion to other works,"I wanted to state my own agreement with the previous reviewer. It is a book that gives original material. If that is what you are looking for, the book strikes major themes within the works. If you are looking for further exposition on those works, this is not the book for you. As there is very little original material besides those cited it is hard to justify a high rating, but don't let the rating dissuade you: the original text is what it is (of course translated into English as appropriate).Philosophers included are (in order): Amerigo Vespucci, Desiderius Erasmus, Martin Luther, Nicolas Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei, Michael de Montaigne, Francis Bacon, Pierre Gassendi, Rene Descartes, Thomas Hobbes, Blaise Pascal, Baruch Spinoza, Nicolas Malebranche, Gottfried Leibniz, and Pierre Bayle, for a total of about 333 pages of their works (the rest is bibliography, index, and introduction)."
5,A Fantastic Book,"This novel is dramatic and poetic, a story about passion and the destructiveness of ambivalence, in a wild, exotic setting. I was struck by the power of the story and the evocative writing."
1,Short Lifespan,I got this bulb through Amazon from Adorama. It lasted less than 4 hours before the filament broke. Just like the one I replaced that had lasted over 25 years. They sure don't make them like they used to.
4,Projector bulb,"These are backup bulbs, so I haven't tried them yet. They look like the correct part and arrived in good condition in the time I was quoted."
2,Nothing New,"Although the information is concise and easy to read and understand, I found nothing of great significance or new here that the casual researcher of information could not find in a short magazine article. Nothing in-depth here, especially if you have already done reading or research on the topic."
5,Highly Recommended,"I can honestly say that this book was a tremendous help. It is easy to read, it answers questions in simple terms, and it gives wonderful tips on how to handle attacks. I also liked that it was not focused on medicines but the focus was put on your person to take control. I highly recommend!"
2,Buy Justified - The Videos Instead!,"I am a HUGE Justin fan, but this DVD is not so great. Actually, I skipped my way through it because it was so boring...and Justin is NOT boring! I went to the live show (in Memphis, not London) and it is sooooo much better than what this DVD makes it out to be. Very amatuerish in quality and quantity.If you're a Justin fan, buy the DVD Justin Timberlake Justified - The Videos instead. I bought both DVDs at the same time, and haven't had Live from London back out of its case since the first viewing. I've watched The Videos DVD tons of times, though. It's great, with alot of bonus footage and interviews with Justin. Please, do yourself a favor and skip Live from London."
1,NOT worth it.,"Don't even waste your time on this DVD. It's not the whole concert, it's not Justin at his best, and is nothing but a shameless sham for some extra money between albums."
1,TOO Unoriginal,First of al let me get this straight Justin tried TOO hard to be like Michael Jackson on the stage. He wears MJs hats and gloves and TRIES to dance like him on this concert(actually everywhere)! Come on justin be like yourself.the concert was awfully teribble so was the dance and music!...He just looked like an MJ copycat..Justin can not be Michael Jackson the Invincible King Of Music! jt the mj wannabeAVOID ANY COSTS...ITS NOT WORTH 1 DOLLAR!let me all advice you some original artists music DVDs:1) Michael Jackson Dangerous the Short Films DVD2) Michael Jackson HIStory Volume II DVDAvoid this DVD at any prices...dont waste your money on timberlakes DVD. Trust me!Thank You...I wish it was helpful enough!
5,Justin Timberlake changed my life,"Before Justin Timberlake, I didn't have much faith in music. Poseurs like Zeppelin, the Doors, and Dylan were getting by on their looks and not for their musical talent (they had none). Then my dawg Justin came along and showed us the real deal. He is a genius and a true innovator of soul and he writes and produces every note of his songs. This concert performance shows how influential he is. His dance moves influenced Michael Jackson, a middle aged man who badly wishes he were Justin. I've been watching this DVD up to 5 times a day because I cannot get enough of this amazing perfomance. I'm Justin's BIGGEST fan. If ever he were to stop recording, I would go to a private room and cry. I can't imagine music without him. This is an incredible DVD and you should get it immeditely."
1,Atrocious!,"Please don't buy this DVD, it's simply too awful for words! This guy is a complete rip-off of every single male artist that's graced the stage before him, except he completely lacks their talent! ""Live from London"" is just another word for CRAP! I advise you to stay away from this, you'll feel much better for it!!"
5,Amazing...but they should have shown the whole thing!,"I was at this concert, and I can assure you that what you see on the DVD is only half as good as the full concert was. Even so, this is a must have for all JT fans and anyone else who wants to see how live performing should be done."
4,Where are the other tracks?!,"Its brilliant, exept for the fact that songs are missing. If you watch ""Cry Me River"" first you will be blown away, its that good and i'm not saying it just because i'm a fan, IT'S BRILLIANT!!!Buy it fans and those who like him a bit."
2,Very short playing time !!!,"Although the show is great and the bonus CD is a nice extra I think a playing time of only 44 minutes is way too short. It's not even the full show as at least the track ""Last night"" is excluded from this DVD that is so short already !!! Why such a rush job ??? Why not a cool tour documentary about the amazing year Justin had both on and off the road ? What about tour rehearsals and stuff like that ? A ""full"" DVD with the bonus CD as addition (for a bonus CD there's nothing to complain as the audio CD is a really neat extra)would be the package that was REALLY interesting. This seems like a quick cash-in and somehow I do expect a ""full"" DVD incl. rehearsals etc. next year..."
4,Great For Any Justin Timberlake Fan!,"I was reading pass reviews on this DVD and I had to see it to believe it. I'm a huge fan of his and I didn't care that it was only 90 minutes of show time. Although, their could have been some more features. Hopefully when Justin comes back on tour again and puts out a new album, i'll release another DVD with more extended material. Another good thing is that it has a BONUS CD! So if your a true fan you will really enjoy the DVD!"
3,Disappointing,"No the concert was not disappointing... the fact that only 6 songs were featured in this ""Live"" DVD. As for the performance itself.. Justin definitely knows how to put on a good show.. if only his fans could get to re-live it in its entirety! I hope Christina's DVD has the whole concert... they should have released a Justified and Stripped DVD with both concerts..that would have been a sell out!! C'mon guys... get a clue!! Still... just to have snippets from an excellent performance.. u have to get this DVD!"
4,good,all in all it was great but it definently doesnt seem the same after seeing ot live. they only played 6 of the 13 or 12 or watever songs on it the the video was hott an dso is justin i suggest you buy it also becuz of the bonus cd w/ im lovin it and worthy of ( a hiiden tra ck only a few people got lucky to get on the original cd) and 2 remixes. good except for miising songs actually would be 4.9
5,brill,"It was a very good dvd, he sounded exellent and it is the sort of dvd that you would watch over and over again.Justin Timberlake was very fit"
3,Not bad. Not bad at all.,"This graphic novel provides a decent way to kill an hour and a half or so, and for those interested in the Star Wars Mythos and universe this book has added value in expanding on earlier generations of jedi.For those of you who have played the superb XBOX RPG - 'Knights of the Old Republic,' it is interesting to note similar story elements found in that game within this 1995 book. For example - Battle Meditation, construction of lightsabers with crystals, etc. The artwork is decent and the story flows at a nice pace. All together a snappy read but not quite a classic."
2,Corny and weak,"This comic book is not very good. The stories are corny and sound like rip-offs of plenty of other stories, probably even ones already created in the Star Wars universe. The artwork looks outdated, too. There are many better comic book choices out there."
2,maybe it is a problem -,I received the microphone but did not receive as advertised the free Shock Mount! NTG1 is definitely one of my favorite microphones. I have three of them.
4,A bad cover hides good music within,"Ok, so the cover isn't the worst but it did make me think ""what in the hell did i just grab?!"" I picked this album up on a whim and really didn't want to give it much a shot. Then, one late night i chucked the music into a player and found myself seriously digging the tunes. To be totally unfair to the band on a few tracks the lead singer has a bit of a Conor Oberst vibe strolling. This music however is FAR less pretentious and you'll find yourself wanting to spin it again and again."
2,Very Disappointed.,I was so excited to see this toy. My daughter wants to be a vet and so I picked this up for her 7th birthday. She was ecstatic but within 10 minutes (I kid you not!) the dog cradle hook was broken. The helicopter hoisting hook was also showing stress marks after hoisting the pony so I'm sure it's going to go soon too. This has left me and my daughter very disappointed. I expected much more from Animal Planet and Toys R Us. I do not recommend this product.
1,Another cheap toy from Toys R Us,"I bought this for my 5 year old's birthday. He has said for the past two years that he wants to be a ""pet ambulance man"" when he grows up. This is the only toy that comes close to that dream, so I bought it without checking that it came from Toys R Us.Within two days it broke. The top propeller snapped off, and it is broken beyond repair.Don't buy this. It's a piece of junk."
1,What a Waste,"As a Kiss fan I never realized how good Ace and Peter were until I heard this pathetic album. I thought St. Anger by Metallica was a bad sounding CD. This could be the worst sounding album I have ever heard. As far as the music is concerned. I hope you have iTunes, because Firestarter is the only track worthwhile. And you guessed it, its a not written by Gene. I like his politics better than his music. I am embarassed as a Kiss fan to say I bought this. Luckily its only $9.99 on iTunes!!!!- with tax.. DONT BUY IT. I read that he recorded most of it in his living room. It sounds like it too. WE WANT ACE AND PETER!!!!!"
1,Garbage,"First of all I only got one, I expected a pair.Second it is really cheep material and build, cost probably 10 cents or less to make in china. Probably they are charging that much (over $4) since they send you this tiny garbage in a oversized box so you mostly paying for shipping.I went and bought a much better adjustable ones a pair) from Wal-Mart for almost the same price."
1,Too small,This thing might be fine if you are sitting in the passenger seat right next to it but it is too small to see much from the drivers side which is why I bought it. Wish I had not purchased it.
5,The right filter for my humidifer,This filter is the exact one for my duracraft humidifer. The price was very reasonable and I have bought them before from Amazon.
5,Best Karate is the Best,"Best Karate Series books are excellent and this one is no exception. The transistion from technique to technique is excellent. Most other books just show the end result of each ""move"", Best Karate shows YOU how to get there. I also liked the Bunkai (application) section for each kata."
1,returned the item,We returned the product after 2 weeks. The coffee pot did not fit the machine and everytime we made coffe it poured out all over the counter.
1,Some Like It Strong,"I know many folks do not follow the guideline of one scoop per cup, and that's fine. This pot might work for you.But if you do, this coffemaker will NOT work for you. If you put more than 7-8 scoops of coffee in the basket, the grounds overflow into your water reservoir. I am now using a $30 Mr. Coffee that works much, much better."
2,do not buy,this coffee maker is awful didn't last 1 1/2 years. paid way to much and kitchenaid would not replace or fix just offered another coffee maker for $85.
4,Nice Hot Coffee,"This coffee-maker is impressive in that it brews a very hot, strong cup of coffee, even on the 1-4 cup setting. I like the permanent gold filter basket, it eliminates finding grounds in that first cup of the day, even the large counter footprint is not as overwhelming as I first anticipated. The only item so far that has become a slight annoyance is that after washing the pot it is difficult to get the cover back on without some bending and maneuvering, sometimes it feels like the cover is going to snap. Overall I am very satisfied with the product, Kitchen Aid comes thru again."
1,electrical problems galore and too soon,"This is the first Kitchenaid coffee maker I've owned, we paid 107.99 for it in October 07, and yesterday morning, we get an err2 displayed on it, an electrical problem. Thats alot of money to spend for a 2 year coffee pot. I will never buy another, wouldn't refer it to anyone. I think I'll stick to the cheapo's (Mr. Coffee) they last a heck of a lot longer, for alot less money."
1,Kitchen Aid Coffee Maker,"First of all, the store in which this was purchased was very good. But, this coffee maker is disapointing. I paid a high price for this product and it is no better, in fact it's worse, than the cheaper coffee makers I've had in the past. There is a non-removable place in which to put the gold filter or paper filter. The grounds go into one of those 2 filter types. Several times my coffee has ended up running over the filters directly pouring grounds into the caraffe and overspilling onto the countertop. I called Kitchen Aid and received another pot but it is the same. I would not recommend this product."
1,worst ever,I've owned several coffer makers and this has to be one of the worst yet!! There's no way to pour water in the pot without pouring out everywhere. It makes the worst gurgleing sounds I ever heard. There's always water underneath the unit itself. I can't think of one good thing to say about this product. Very disappointed with kitchenaid for making such a poor product. I will be returning it!!
2,KITCHEN AID COFFEMAKER SUCKS!,"I can not begin to explain how angry I am with this company. Out of no where my coffee maker (I've had it for 2 years) just stopped working. I was making coffee for friends and then POOF..just stopped. Now I am not someone who does not take care of her appliances. I would run white vingar through maker every month and would unplug the machine when i was not using it. Suddenly an Error 2 message popped up. I googled what that meant..it meant death to my $140 coffeemaker. I called to ask what they could do for me. I was told pretty much ""Sorry idiot, you paid us 140 dollars for something that is worth 20"". I have had Mr. Coffee Makers longer than this one. Stay away from this product. I have to say it is unfortunate because it does make good coffee; that is the only reason why it received a 2 star rating. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,$100 Coffee Maker - Good For About 1 Year,"Spend your money elsewhere, unless you just feel the need to purchase a new coffee maker every or so. Our heating element went out after about 1.5 years, and KitchenAid could care less."
1,Very disappointing,Like others here I have had coffee all over my counter. Now after only 6 months I get an error2 code. I will call kitchenaid today but I really don't want another one. I have other Kitchenaid appliances that I've had for years.
1,Defective,I purchased 3 of these coffeemakers and each one had the same problem.It took a week to three weeks and them some how when the water went into the coffee holder to drip into the carafe it went out of the top and went all over the counter. I called Kitchen Aid after the third purchase and explained my situation and they sent me another coffeemaker which I will not discuss and am still waiting for them to pick up my defective one and that has been over 6 weeks.
1,TERRIBLE! Avoid This Unit At All Costs!,"I am on my third expensive KitchenAid coffee-maker, and they ALL have tne same software problem!KitchenAid has apparently released a ""beta"" version, and it DOES NOT MAKE COFFEE! Plus, you get to argue with their ""unconditional warranty"" people about getting the unit replaced.Apparently KitchenAid isn't what it once was! If you want a cup of coffee, this isn't the way to get it!"
2,Run while you still can,"Let me start with saying I LOVE KITCHENAID! However, they dropped the ball when trying to make a coffee maker. We are on our 4th attempt at getting one to actually work. There were various problems, but I will say that buying the $20 coffee maker from your local grocery store would work better than this coffee maker. Again my whole kitchen is mostly made up of Kitchenaid, but they need to go back to the drawing board when it comes to this product."
3,One problem,"I've had this coffeemaker about a year now, and a few months ago it developed a problem. If you don't have the pot ""just so"" underneath the filter area, the coffee will not go through. It fills up the filter area, and fortunately I only make a few cups at a time. If I made more cups I'm sure it would spill over. As it is, some coffee does somehow miss the pot and end up sizzling on the burner. So when I make coffee I have to watch and make sure it's going through okay, or I could have a mess to clean up."
2,Looks Great - Tastes Mediocre,"I'm usually a big fan of KitchenAid appliances and I own a Proline coffee grinder, which is excellent. But, I could not get a good full-flavored cup of coffeee out of this machine. I usually brew 4 cups at a time. They have a setting for 1-4 cups, but the coffeee still turned out slightly weak and slightly bitter. I returned it and will try something else."
2,Kitchen Aid Does NOT hold to it's name!,"We purchased this coffee machine with the idea that it must be good due to KitchenAid's rep and all of the good reviews listed. However, if you enjoy strong coffee this is not the machine for you. We have had ours a couple of weeks now and coffee grinds spill over into our coffee. If you like weak coffee, this is your machine."
2,Two Strikes and your out!,"I received the first 14-cup coffeemaker around Thanksgiving. The first time I set the coffeemaker to auto for morning coffee, I woke up to coffee all over the counter and on the floor. It happened at couple more times. I called Kitchenaid and they said you must have the decanter set perfectly positioned on the warming tray with the handle facing the middle (not stated in the instructional booklet). Tried that and still had problems. Like Paul from Naperville said in his review, the pause device is the problem, bad design. My other complaint was coffee grounds every other day in the brewed coffee. KitchenAid sent me a replacement coffeemaker thinking that mine was faulty yet the grounds continued. The coffeemaker has too many design problems. Kitchenaid was great to work with and I hope they are rethinking their design. I am now getting a refund from KitchenAid."
1,Piece of Junk...Save your time & money!!,I was so excited to get my new Kitchenaid coffeemaker until I started reading the Amazon reviews. I received it yesterday and unpacked it hoping it would work okay and all those bad reviews were wrong. THEY WERE RIGHT!! The carafe won't stay in place which causes the basket to overfill. The warming plate is too shallow and the lipped edge of the pot too small so it slides back which triggers the sneak-a-cup feature causing the basket to overfill.If I hadn't been standing right next to the machine I would have had 14 cups of steaming hot water all over my hardwood floors. Not even going to mess with trying to get it fixed...going back today.
5,"Beats our old Starbucks brewers, hands down!","Flavor is great. Pot beeps when coffee is ready; beeps when it shuts off the heating element too! Coffee ground issue is, I'm sure, related to the brass/plastic basket that comes with the pot. If you overfill the basket with gounds, they do get in the water. However, if you use a paper filter with the same amount of grounds , it works fine. Poorly engineered ground basket. If you want a brass basket, purchase a third party one. We also have the KA coffee grinder which is better than any I've owned, including the Braun and Starbucks which both died an early and untimely death. KA appliances still going strong after more than a year."
5,Love Kitchenaide,"I LOVE this coffee maker and would not change anything about it!! This is a great coffee maker for those on the go. The auto shut off is great knowing that I most likely will forget to turn off the machine, it turns off after 2 hours. Not to mention, when having guests over, the beeper will remind me to brew another pot, or to check to see if coffee needs to be made, or time to clean. I love the nice sleek look that matches my kitchenaide appliances throughout my kitchen. It blends so well on my countertop. It is easy to use and clean. The coffee burner stays hot for the two hours. I am not a big fan of super HOT coffee but this machine does not brew as hot as some of them on the market. I loveit and would not change a thing, but if you are a HOT HOT coffee lover you may be disappointed."
2,didn't last,"I have many Kitchenaid products. I've loved every one of them and had no problems. So when we went to buy a new coffee maker i insisted on this one to match my kitchen, even though my husband thought it was too expensive. I talked him in to it by saying kitchenaid lasts forever and we won't need to buy another one of these for many years to come. He finally agreed. this worked great for about 2 years and then i got an error3 message on the computer screen of the pot. I turned it off and on like the manual said to do. then i got a new error message, error2. according to the manual that meant the computer was shot in the coffee pot. I couldn't believe it. I was very disappointed. and my husband is now doing the ""i told you so""! :("
2,stop working after less then a year,"Purchased this less then a year ago, barely use the product maybe once a week and it now just shows an error code when i turn it on. Buy something else."
1,I only wish 0 stars was possible,"I bought this POS about 2 years ago, and have used it 2-3 times per week. I got an error2 today, and after some web based research, so have a lot of other people. I liked this nice looking coffee maker while it worked, but now I am very disappointed. Do yourself a freakin favor and avoid this coffee maker!!!"

5,Persian New Testament,"I have a dear friend, now a refugee in Kyiv, Ukraine, who was wanting a Persian Bible & I was able to find it on Amazon without any trouble & am mailing it to him.Thank you so much.Shirley"
3,"Useful, but somewhat outdated","While Kendall's revision dates to 1993, Sykes wrote the bulk of this in 1952 and in the intervening years, new discoveries and translations have made some parts of some entries inaccurate. The book is in standard, alphabetical format, with entries on deities ranging from a brief sentence to a couple of paragraphs. Their roles in myths are necessarily very briefly summarized although a number of entries on the creation legends of various cultures are more fully developed, running as long as a couple pages.This book is best used as a launching point for further investigation. Find an entry that sparks your interest and then track down a fuller version of the myths or legends wherein they feature. Otherwise, it serves as a fair quick reference guide, but I wouldn't consider it authoritative."
2,Meridian 9316CW Telephone Black,Meridian 9316CW Telephone Black arrived without manuals and the accessories were dumped in the box.Not packaged properly---I returned it
4,Good Phone; Worst Seller Ever,"The phone works as advertised and I'm generally satisfied with the quality of the phone, both its appearance and functionality. However, I had the worst time dealing with both the Manufacturer - Astrata - and the Seller - Price Pros for a simple question I had. They both were at the same time non-responsive and unprofessional. If you have a chance and like the phone, try to get it through another seller or a similar phone from a different manufacturer."
1,Speakerphone subpar,"I bought this phone because it looked like the quality Nortel phones I remember from my corporate days. What I got looks like a relatively well-made Chinese copy. But you can tell....I read all the reviews here, some saying the speakerphone was good, some saying it was poor. Well, my speakerphone experience has been pretty bad. Usually, I can *hear* just fine but the mic isn't picking up my voice. I've left dozens of voicemail messages to myself trying to troubleshoot the problem. 90% of the time I get no voice pick-up; about 5% of the time it fades in and out, and the rest of the time it works reasonably well.But how can you place a phone call under those circumstances? These phones will be going back in the box...."
5,Pop up boo\,"Sabuda collaborates with another great fairy tale to create a wonderful pop up book for children and adults alike. If you like the classic stories that you grew up with, you will love this pop up book!"
3,A good story about the power of forgiveness.,I enjoyed this third book of the Men of the Saddle series but not as much as the first book. I thought the hero and heroine fought a bit too much (IMO). But other than that I don't have any major complaints. Lori's books are well written with natural conversations. I will definitely read more by her.
3,"Engaging, but...","I liked this book for the most part, but I came away shaking my head. How could a Christian book be about a girl who lies and deceives her way into Cass' heart? Her ""change"" just doesn't seem plausible to me. Susanne is going to do whatever it takes to get what she wants."
2,So called Christian!!,"This book was horrible from the beginning when Susanne lied about being soiled by an innocent man! How can you fall in love through that. She lied through the whole book.If anybody's looking to this book for inspiration, look elsewhere.Her behavior was never Christ like. She used Cass and done him wrong with the mind set (All in the name of good) and he owed her to take care of her every need; voluntarily or involuntarily!Horrible heroine character!!! Liked Cass alright enough except he was a foolish gullible doormat."
1,An old story rewritten for the Christian market,"This took no effort at all on the author's part. This book was written years ago for the secular market, ""Christianized,"" and resold. A total ripoff."
2,"Cleans the cats, but irritates skin and causes rashes","The product seemed to work well, the cats fur was noticeably cleaner. The cats didn't mind the cleaning. BUT, a couple weeks after using it, both cats had small sores over their backs. They've never had skin problems and are both 8 years old. I can only assume this product was the cause. I may use the product again, but make sure to rinse their fur well with a damp cloth after."
3,Seems like it leaves a film,"This seems to clean ok but it seems like it leaves a film on my cat's fur and I worry about him licking his fur after I use it. To remedy this I try to wipe him off well with a damp paper towel (like it tells you), only use it 2-3 times a month, and just focus on areas that really need cleaned. It smells good...not too strong but still smells clean. Our cat is long haired so this is a much better option than a full bath. I haven't noticed much of a difference in his dandruff or the softness of his coat. For us, just frequent brushing and adequate nutrition has the best results on his coat."
3,"GOOD, BUT CERTAINLY NOT HIS BEST","YES, I LEARNED A LOT AND FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE BOOK NOW THAT I AM FINISHED. I DO HOWEVER, FEEL THE BOOK DRAGGED AND WAS SOMEWHAT DRY. UNLIKE MANY OF THE OTHER REVIEWS I READ HERE, THIS WAS NOT ONE BOOK I COULDN'T PUT DOWN. I HAVE READ 8 MICHENER NOVELS AND CONSIDER HIS WORK TO BE AMONG THE BEST, BUT TO DATE THIS HAS BEEN THE WEAKEST. AS USUAL THERE ARE MANY INTERESTING HISTORICAL EVENTS THAT MICHENER PUTS IN PERSPECTIVE, IN AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND MANNER."
2,Exmark #603809 replacement belt,The belt is a bit longer than the original and doesn't fit well. It's functional but not correct so I'll be replacing ASAP.
5,Hardwired Behavior,"If you want to read one book that gives a comprehensive, understandable overview of how modern neuroscience is contributing to our understanding of human morality, this is the book to read.Laurence Tancredi writes lucidly. His images of the brain are excellent and his glossary is very helpful.His perspective on ""Hardwired Behavior: What Neuroscience Reveals about Morality"" can be summarized in his words found on page 81 of the book: ""Advances in neuroscience and cell biology . . . strongly back the . . . theory, which holds that our brains possess all the built-in options for mental capacity and development. The environment, through instruction, merely selects, but does not alter, options already built into the brain. An environmental challenge, or signal, at an appropriate time triggers the brain's capacity to engage in moral thinking."""
3,Too small,"My review is very simple:I'm a guy with very large feet, wearing a size 16 in most brands. Despite that fact, I'm generally able to fit into socks that are supposed to fit guys up to a size 12-13. I'd also fit into other Wigwam socks in the past and intentionally bought these because of that. The socks came and don't even begin to fit me. I ended up giving them to my girlfriend who they fit perfectly."
3,An allegorical tale...,"This short book reads like an allegory, as three people come together as ""Adam"", ""Eve"" and ""Mentor"", to discover the truths revealed in a book they read together, ""Children of Grace"". Throughout the story, the three become sensitized to their roles in life as Black-Americans who appreciate their heritage. Although brief, REDEMPTION SONG is a call to the future, including ""A Recipe for Life"", meant to enrich and encourage. I gave it three stars only because it is written so simply, but at the same time, I believe the author wants to reach as wide an audience as possible, her message one of healing and acceptance."
5,So happy I read it.,"This book was calling from the moment I saw the cover on BET. I read the book in one day and I still go to pick it up so I can read it again, as if the story is still going on and I am missing out on something.From beginning to the end you get caught up in the story line. Berry put the characters together so well. It does not leave you guessing to what is going on, but instead grabs you into the complete story. You feel as though you have fallen in to the setting. You can feel yourself in the different places and times the book goes to. I could see the way the main characters looked at each other. I could even smell the biscits cooking. The book made me smile, laugh out loud for the fist time in three months and even cry. The most important thing it made me do is cherish my family more and want to take more responsibility for the events going on in my life and those around me.If Berry keeps writing like this she will have a true loyal fan for life."
5,A LOVE STORY WITH HEART,"A love story that had to be told. This book left me with a feeling of love and completeness. The story was well written and had your attention from chapter one. As the story unwind, you could feel the pain, the joy and finally the peace. This is a 5 stars book worth reading. This is a book you want all your friends to read.I'm looking forward to reading Ms. Berry new book very soon."
5,Great Book! Our Ancestors Are Smiling!,"This is such a great book with its universal message.Its intriguing, suspensful, loving, humoruous, and some traces of beautiful sadnness.Thank you Dr.Berry for listening to the voices of our ancestors and telling their story through the 4 major characters in this book. A must read!"
5,a beautiful story - not only for women and African-Americans,"A friend gave me this beautiful book, which I read over the last couple of evenings. I hope potential readers don't presume that because the book is written by an African American woman the reader should also be female and black. I'm a 43-year-old white guy and I was moved, touched, delighted and inspired. I encourage others who may not fit the likely ""target market"" to pick up this book. You won't be sorry."
2,Early Virginia Families Along The James River,"Lots of family names are listed, but unfortunately only for one County, namely Prince Georges County. Also, the front cover states this book is ""Volume II"". Where are the other Volumes and what do they contain?. This book was not properly described snd had it been, I would not have ordered it. It will serve some well, but I'm sending it back."
4,Poetry Pleasure,"Refractions of Life is a delightful collection of poems written by older adults. The poems are grouped into different headings including: Pleasure of poetry, Loved ones, In a lighter Vein, Nature and the Seasons, Growing Older, A Matter of Conscience, and the Post 9/11 Hope and Inspiration. Some of the poems made me laugh out loud, others inspired me with hope. Thank you to all those that contributed to this anthology with thier well written prose."
3,It's Ok but you need more info,"This book is great to get the necessary info for the exam. Unfortunally, it's not enough. I'd recommend to combine it with Wrox's Professional C#, Wrox's Professional ASP.net and Microsoft Official Curriculum for ADO.net. Anyway, this book it's a must if you reallya are seroius about the exam."
1,A Joke and ripoff,This is a useless book. It has so many errors that you will have headache. Very poor explanation. Normally MS Press books are good but Microsoft did a very poor job on this. I should use this book in fireplace to get some benifit out of it. I would like to give this book negative star if I can but I cant.
2,Code samples are full of errors,"The authors were apparently faced with an aggressive deadline for this book because it's exceptionally bad, even relative to other MS Press books. Due to the inaccurate writing and poor editing I wasted many late-night hours trying to get the sample code provided for the labs to run properly. Very little of the prescribed code even runs at all, without modification. Corrections for the most obvious errors are published on the MS Press support site but many of the other problems are quite subtle. I'm a decent programmer -- If I do say so myself <g> -- but I had to spend a lot of time on ASP sites researching solutions to all these errors.The code design recommendations are also surprisingly poor, the type of code one would expect from a very junior developer, possibly someone who's not even cut out for this line of work."
1,worst book for exams,"This book should not put Exams word in the cover. It is very misleading. Because it is offical published by Miccrsoft Press, many people would think that it is enough to pass exam. It should warn readers not to rely this book for Exam. If you do rely, you will fail.I hope all other readers are aware of this. Don't waste money buying this book for passing exam."
1,Worst Technical Book I've Ever Seen,"I've been in this field for almost 10 years and this is definitely the worst technical book i've ever seen. If the authors were working for me, I'd fire them, quickly. The code is poorly written; doesn't follow C# coding standards published by MS, many of the examples produce errors when compiling the unedited code from the accompanying CD, the text is riddled with wrong information, etc. Do you like debugging code written by authors who are supposed to be showing you how to do things? Much of it doesn't compile. You'll do lots of that. Goto support.microsoft.com and enter knowledge base id = 326884 to see the running list of errors. They gave up compiling the list around page 200 of a 700+ page book (got too long?). Believe me they didn't document more than 10% of the errors in the first 200 pages. Don't waste ANY money or TIME reading this book. There are plenty of other choices."
3,Good Introduction material but not enough,"I just passed the exam 70-315 C# version. The material I used are this book, MSDN on line help on some special topics and transcender practice kit. The transcender kit is very help in preparing for the exam after you completed reading this book and MSDN online helps. The coverage on ADO.Net is very basic, I passed 70-316 a few month ago. The coverage for ADO.Net is almost the same."
1,Skip this book,Skip this book!!! Microsoft should have done a better job reviewing this book for content value. Try the ASP.NET And ADO.NET book instead (Esposito).
2,Rush Job,"The book is a good introduction and overview of all the information needed to pass the test. But it is full of typos, and a lot of the sample code doesn't work without modification. The C# sample code is especially bad; it seems that they only tested the VB code and then just translated it to C# without testing. I found several errors in the attempts at exception handling. Even when the code is not wrong, it looks very amateurish. In a way, it is a good workout, as it forces you to learn enough to fix the code, but I am pretty sure that I haven't learned any ""best practices"" from this book.The book needed some more review and polishing before being published. It's the only official study guide available now--it's too bad that no other choices are available."
3,inadequate to master Web Prog but a good start,"As true with Microsoft Products, later versions of book will improve. This book gives a feeling that it was rushed to Press. The examples either omit a few steps or assumes reader is already familiar with intricacies ( which doesn't make sense.If they were, they wont be reading this book). Dont expect that all the examples will run out of box. You will have to fiddle around to make them work. I guess that will make you proficient in Web Programming :) May be the second edition will address those issues. The chapters somehow appear to be inadequate for the topics they address.All that said, The Book does give good introduction to variousfacets of Web Programming. This book alone is definitely not sufficient to master Web Programming but a good start..."
3,Good but not enough,"This book covers all the topics that you will need for the exam, but I don't think that it will be enough to make you pass the exam.ADO.NET for example is only covered in Chapter 5 and not in great details.The exam on the CD only contains 50 questions, and it's really REALLY annoying that you can not review your answers at the end!Here are the additional resources that will help you pass the exam1- transcender exams -- am a big fan and their exams are usually harder than the real one. Moreover, you'll know exactly what to expect for the real exam after doing the transcender ones!2- Wrox ASP.NET Professional covers some features such as ADO.NET in much more details that this MS Press book does, and you will need that for the examSo, in a few words, this book is good, and I would recommend it, but it is simply not enough to pass the examGood luck!"
1,Full of errors and does not teach anything,"I found the book poorly written and confusing. I found significant coding errors that a novice would find very frustrating. If you are new to .NET, I believe this book will do more to confuse you than teach you. If you are preparing for the exam, many of the exam objectives are not adequately covered. I expect the exam to have in-depth questions about DataSets, Server Controls and ASP.NET web site design scenarios. All you get is error-prone code examples and one or two generic overview. I highly suggest bypassing this book and look for alternative means to studying the exam objectives."
2,Book Decent...CD VERY POOR !!!,"This ""study guide"" is more an overview of ASP.NET. It merely touches on the topics and does not go into much detail. Granted it does contain some useful information that you may not find in other books, but it does not prepare you for the test. Also, the CD is very poor; it does not allow you to choose the number of questions, nor does it provide you with the explanation for the correct answers. Study on your own for this one."
1,Good For Nothing,This book just covers the basics of all topics. The examples in the book are not fully explanatory and the Exam test provided on CDROM does not give any explanation of the answers. I took the practice test several times and getting 13 wrong answers everytime which I think to be correct. There is no way to know which questions I gave wrong answers and their correct answers. I don't recommend to simply rely on this book for the preparation of MCP Exam.
2,A real disappointment,"I expect more from Microsoft. Perhaps I shouldn't but I do. Besides the ever present grammatical mistakes, there are a plethora of logic errors which make it impossible for a beginner to learn. Also, some key topics are used before they are discussed in the text.Try another book"
2,Book is Good; CD is BAD!!!,"The book as a whole is a good training book with lessons (4-stars) Be advised...the CD test that comes with this kit is very limited; it does not allow you to choose the number of questions, does not show you which questions you got correctly/incorrectly, and does NOT show you the correct questions (no question review). That said, the CD is pretty much useless. (1-star) Overall: 2.5 stars."
2,You'd better already know this stuff,"This book doesn't give a writer's credit, and if I were the writer I wouldn't mind, because it wouldn't be a feather in my cap.Since this book is ""official"" from Mount Olympus, you probably need it to get a good idea of what concepts will be tested. Other than that, though, it's not worth a lot.Microsoft should be ashamed of publishing this book.As you struggle through it, you'd better have other references or online doc at the ready to help you navigate through the unexplained terms, the incomplete tables, the inconsistent use of terms, the out-of-context code fragments, the persistent MPC (Microsoft Politically Correct) terminology, AND the completely wrong statements. Wow...It does have a pretty cover, though. That's why I gave it two stars instead of one.Mike"
3,Want to get really Confused?,"Teaching the 2 languges side by side is really annoying. While I can understand the reasoning for it it just makes things more confusing.The overall content is good, only experienced developrs should apply.The simulated test application that comes with the book is full of errors. It doesn't even tell you which questions you missed. You would also expect the book to cover all topics that are on the test that comes with it but it doesn't.The MsPress site has 0 erratas for the book as well. This will be my last MS press book."
2,disappointing,"I regret buying this book. It has been very frustrating to use. There are frequently small bits of code missing which result in things not working as they should, if at all. I know enough (from OTHER ASP.NET books) to have a general idea of what is wrong, but it is still quite frustrating. I've been particularly disappointed by the ADO.NET chapter. I wanted to use this book as a study resource to prepare for the MCAD web apps certification exam, which the book is supposedly a training kit for. Instead I feel I've wasted time and money. I'm just glad I didn't pay full price. Personally, I recommend Stephen Walther's ASP.NET Unleashed and the O'Reilly ASP.NET Nutshell book. Both are much better."
1,WARNING: THIS DOES NOT PREP YOU FOR THE EXAM!,"Check out the table of contents for this book before you buy it! It arrived in the mail today. What a disappointment. The cover looks great and the title sounds great. This is ""an intro to web development using ASP.NET"" book. In fact, that's what its title should be.Take a look at the table of contents on mspress' site. Here are a few topics:* How Web Applications Work* Parts of a Web Application* The Start Page* The Toolbox* Editing Code* Getting Help* Using Frames* Setting Up a Virtual Folder* Playing Audio* Displaying Video* Using Cascading Style Sheets* etc...the list goes onOk, none of this [junk] is on the exam the cover claims to prepare you for! Better luck with a professional asp.net wrox press book. Unfortunately, this one is only for the absolute beginners...might be ok if this is your very first asp.net or web development book."
2,2 stars only because it's an official curriculum publication,"I agree with most of the readers here: the book is quite a shame.I often had to figure out myself the code needed (i.e. they used classes but they didn't show how to define them first). I guess it shows what's expected to be known on the exam, but I'm helping my study with the good old MSDN and other books (Troelsen & c.).Too much money for such poor contents..."
2,Where's the beef?,"This book is a big disappointment mainly because there is only enough material here for one good magazine article. The author goes on about tangential issues like the political atmosphere in Spain after the 3/11 bombings but has precious little to say about al Qaeda or the war on terror. It's only about 200 pages of large print, with maybe 3/4 of that in actual text, of which maybe 50 pages addresses the book's main theme. The author should have taken a little more time for research, maybe on the war in Afghanistan or the battle against the terrorists in Iraq now rather than rushing into print. There's some interesting stuff here, badly written and organized, but not enough to justify a book."
4,Tells more of what the press doesn't tell you,"An interesting book about activities and decisions made during the ""war on terror"" that won't show up in detail on television for years and if they do at all it will be within late night documentaries. The section on the attempted but mostly thwarted terrorist war at sea was fascinating. Amazon reviews vary based on the politics of the reviewers. As with many decisions of war they are brilliant or stupid depending on your point of view. I must comment that I rate the book highly as a current source of information that I don't want to miss since these type of books go out of print and are seldom reprinted due to the ""hear and now news"" flavor of the writing. So buy now for the current information and hold your nose if you don't like the politics. I give a 4 instead of 5 since history will likely provide 20/20 hindsight that could change some of the conclusions so a 4 is likely my best rating for any ""current news"" type book."
2,Not a very good read,"Slow,boring and short. There are but few tidbits of information that are interesting and worthwhile. This book is not worth $30. Get it used or just skip it."
1,Shadow Snore,"Following in the footsteps of his previous work, Miniter continues his assault on our senses with his turgid prose in Shadow War. The actual writing barely takes up 160 pages of wide spaced type with nearly half the book consisting of appendices, notes, bibliography, index and an absurdly smug 6 pages of acknowledgements. Other than being between two covers, the six chapters have little to do with each other and look like a collection of standalone articles the author could not manage to get printed in a periodical when they might have been relevant. While Miniter claims these so-called blockbusters have been ignored by the media, it becomes clear in reading them why this is the case. Unfortunately for Miniter, news events in Iraq and elsewhere have overtaken the stale theses he presents in this book. It is beyond me who is buying this outside the conservative foundation bulk purchasers. I have read papers from my community college students that outshine Shadow Snore."
1,Nothing New,"It always irks me to pay to read a book that is supposed to grace you with insider information only to find that nothing new is delivered. Anyone who is reasonably well versed on current events, or on this topic specifically, will scratch their head wondering where is the ""untold story"" in this slim (168 page) tome. Save your money."
1,So@Weak,"I bought this book thinking it would give me some ammunition for dealing with Liberals, but this doesn't really support the President like I had hoped. There are lots of details that are left out, and the writer could have shown a little more support for the President. Bush will win the war on terror."
2,Author's Political Bias Evident Throughout,"Its been a while since I've read a title as slanted and one-sided as Shadow War. The title most definitely is attempting to sway the reader to think as the author does, rather than weigh facts based on independent thought.If you are a fan of Bush and looking for a book that repeats everything you already believe as opposed to an objective analysis of the facts, this title is for you. If you are looking for an non-biased examination of the facts, keep looking because you haven't found that here.This title is better described as propaganda than intellectual reading."
4,Can Someone please 'Review'?,"My hope is that someone will boot my comment off. But in going down the list of costumer reviews, many are not in fact 'reviews.' They seem to be blugeonings for the sake of typing something about a topic they have a personal opinion on. I would say that I have gone down the list and especially the ones that have 1 star. Their attacks are not on content, on writing style, on evidence, on the book. They are political attacks on the writer. I would hope people can write something useful so I can get an idea of what the book is about, not so much anything else.***I gave it its rating of 4 stars to try and minimize the effect of this post on the books average. Please view this as a review of the reviews and not anything about the book. I'm still deciding whether not to buy it. ***"
5,Informative details of the war on terror,"This book is very informative regarding the ongoing war on terror throughout the world. The danger is still out there, but there are, surprisingly, many countries involved in tracking down the terrorists and disrupting their plans. The author gives numerous brief stories of this ongoing war. After reading this book I now better understand why we must not let our guard down or fail in the efforts to stop terrorism."
1,Read It In A Flash,"I don't know about you, Grandpa Jay, but I can read 160 pages of large font, widely spaced type in under two hours. Now I want those two hours back!"
1,How many lies can a book contain ?,"More than I can count. But since this is a short review of the book, lets stick to the one reason to toss this book into the recycle bin.Clinton created a lean and mean military, not Bush. Any success Bush and Rumsfeld have ever done is because of Clinton and his advisors. Bush and Rumsfeld have never served in a war, nor have they seen combat. Does anyone really think they could battle terrorism ? Not on their life and not on any of their rich relatives lives either. (Except for Bush Sr, who was a great president because he had actually seen war and combat.) Leave the wars to people who know about war and leave this author, who hasn't served either, to gather dust."
1,This book should be rated a negative 5.,This book is a farce. The author has absolutely no idea what he is talking about. I suggest he start over and this time do his homework. This book should be listed under pure fiction.
1,Where did you do your research?,This doesn't even deserve a review. Take off your rose colored glasses and wake up!
4,"Still plan to use this software, but...","This software is great, it is fast, and I can transfer files between two machines, but if you are on a budget though, check in to VNC - Virtual Network Client. It provides the ability to remotely view another computer (platform independent) from your machine.Using VNC I can log in to my Linux and Windows XP machines from MacOS X. There seems to be a performance hit, not sure why though. It isn't as polished as Timbuktu, but it works, and VNC is open source."
4,bloodworms are tasty,fish liked them uptil he got frozen ones.make sure you are not allergic to them before you purchase them. i discovered i was and they made me itch!the betta loved them though
2,The original talk show Ringmaster.,"Morton Downey Jr. puts many of today's Talk Show wannabe's to shame with the antics he himself created on TV over 10 years ago.Read this book if you are currently addicted to those ""shock"" Talk Shows. It will show you where many of them originated."
3,Barely sustaining,"I found the book to be oonly adequate. Various publication issus are also at issue, because things like the font type, size, paper, just made the book a little more trouble and harder to read. Other books are far more comprehensive and better put together."
1,Don't Bother,"Having read a few of the books that she has edited, I was very disappointed in this one. The stories did not reach out and grab me the way that I expected them to. I would defintlty say you are better off with one of her other works"
5,"Witty dialogue, wonderful characters, fantastic storytelling","I had never read a book from Victoria Alexander before, but after this one, I will definately be heading to my local library to find more! Her writing style is one that I've always enjoyed from some of my favorite authors, mainly because the heroine has a razor-sharp intelligence. The witty dialogue between Tessa and all the characters in the book were laugh-out loud funny, and I especially loved her affectionate ""pet name"" for Galahad -- Big Guy. Being only 5'3"" myself, I really love tall guys, and Sir Galahad, like he was supposed to, stole my heart. If you love the legend of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, along with the ""Wizard Extraordinaire and Counselor to Kings"" Merlin, then this is the book for you."
1,Don't Bother,"I thought it would be a Regency novel too. I was not only disappointed, but bored. I bounced back and forth between wanting to continue and wanting to give up. Finally I gave up. Tessa was so annoying. She was like a 15-year-old, complaining about everything, and insisting that she was right and blah blah blah blah. ""Like, you know? That's so fake, and all in my imagination. Oh my God, I'm insane! Like, totally that's the greatest thing I've ever heard, and I sooo need to go home so and teach the subject that I hate the most...""Yawn. So immature and hard to relate to. Also, there was hardly any romance here at all! Just skip this one."
2,Wow!!! I didnt expect this...,"I really find this book kind of bad. I bought this book because of all the 5 star reviews and I regret it. I really didnt even understand when the two fell in love. I also found Tessa's language to be kind of over the top. I honestly dont think a real modern day person speaks with that much slang. The writer was kind of pushing it. Tessa kept calling Galahad ""BIG GUY"". That really bothered me. It was like as soon as I was starting to feel the emotion of the character she said these words and I felt like she wasnt talking about the love of her life. She was talking about a dog or something. I even found myself scanning pages to see which ones I could skip without missing to much information. I give this book a 2 just because I think that when she had to leave him in the end was kind of touching. The way they loved eachother. I am not into the magic stuff. Its just not realistic. This was my first book from this author, but I dont think I will try her again."
2,"Wow, not what I expected...","I was a little hesitant to pick up this book because there was very little description on the back of the book...now I know why. Time traveling to the Middle Ages?!? And falling in love with Galahad?? Really? I don't know...that seemed a little far-fetched for me. I will concede that the writing was well done, but if I had known that the storyline was going to be like this, I probably would not have bought it. As it is, I will be re-selling it as soon as possible."
1,"Had potential, but fizzled out ...","I thought this book started out great, but halfway through, I was wondering why I was wasting my time. The female lead was a ditz who too easily accepted her trip back in time. I hated the way she refered to Galahad as ""big guy"" and felt the Merlin and his lover sub-plot was a big distraction. By the time I was on the last 50-pages I wondered why I had bothered."
1,Poorly written,"One of the more poorly written books I have ever read. The leading female character is supposedly a bright associate professor teaching ancient history and speaks as if she is a cab driver with a 6th grade education (yet somehow, medieval Britons understand most of what she says!). As for the love scenes, there was nothing ""hot"" about them -- try Virginia Henley if you want to read hot love scenes. I'll be leaving this author on the bookself."
2,Falls far short,"Okay, I was thinking I couldn't lose with this one. Time travel - good. Medieval times - good. Romance - good. Ha! This particular mix is not good. It has its moments - the character of Merlin is particularly memorable. However, the whole premise has faults - Camelot? Galahad? Hunting for the Holy Grail? It's all so fabled already that it would take greater talent than Ms. Alexander's to add to its mythology.I particularly couldn't believe the main character, Tessa. She's an assistant professor of literature, yet she behaves so juvenilely about her clothing and the inconveniences of the past? Please - grow up. I liked Galahad for the most part; although, what's the poor guy supposed to do with that name in the 20th century?I have yet to read more Alexander books. I hope the rest are better. For truly excellent time-travel romance, check out Lynn Kurland."
5,Mach 747 rules!!!,I think this is an excellent release. Very well done! this is an excellent track. Although I would have liked to hear the original mix as well. I hope to hear that being released soon. I look forward to hearing more Mach 747 in the near future!!!
4,The Office - The Real American Version,"The character of this series is a worthy succesor to Ricky Gervais in ""The Office"". The only problem that I had with this very imaginative take on reality shows is that the subject matter is not interesting for the fate of the world. C'mon, the problems Valerie have are not real problems. Anyway, this is great fun, and truer to human experience than ""Entourage""."
5,"""Note to self...","I don't need to see THAT!!"" - Great DVD of first and only season of a show too smart, dark and critical of television itself to actually remain ON televison. Valerie Cherish lives!!"
5,I do want to see this!!!,I can't wait for this. Lisa Kudrow was great as Valerie Cherish. I am sad the show is not coming back. It was so funny.
5,"Lisa Kudrow, America's best acress",Cringingly funny. Each episode even more so. Each step she takes is a step too far.Always with the utmost grace.America's most versatile actress doing what she does best...versatility!
1,God-Awful,"This was purely a money saving attempt by HBO. Carnivale had been such an expenbsive show to produce, some say the most expensive ever, they tried to pull this cheap drivel on us with soso production values and a writer who was mailing in episodes from the latrine.It's too bad no stars is not an option here, this show deserves it. Buy this and see foe yourself how much replay value this travesty has. None. A fake reality show following a star trying to regain the spotlight. It COULD have been funny. The acting, pacing, lame jokes, and even lamer inside jokes made this too dreadful to even watch to make fun of. Take the most mundane episode of Entertainment Tonight, dumb it down even further, fire the writing staff, forget all about timing and tempo, combine it with the worst True Hollywood Story ever made, and call it a comedy when it is at most a vanity piece for the star. One star is too much and one season was too much!"
1,Why?,"They're airing this show in France (in English).Having been a big fan of Friends, I was eager to see what they were up to...It seems that apart from Jennifer Aniston the others are really scraping the barrel.(And even she has her bad moments)This show makes you want to pull your eyes out. The plot is very thin, even I would say, thinner than ""Joey"".Total dissapointment..."
4,Loved this show !,"I'd never heard of this show when I purchased it & I am glad that I did. This show peels back the inner workings of a sitcom and the life of it's main character (Valerie Cherish)with hilarious results.What made it so compelling was the feeling, that it was drawn form reality with a dash of tongue in cheek thrown in; to keep it from becoming sad.The story is about an aging hollywood actress who made it BIg at one time and then faded into obscurity.She is cast in a new sitcom and is excited to revive her flagging career, only to find that she is in a supporting role and not the main character. what is worse, she is stripped of any good lines and as time goes by she becomes frumpier and frumpier.Valerie tries to fulfill the role of a sexy aunt, to the main character but they cover her up with variations of velour tracksuits instead.If you want a laugh that pokes fun at sitcoms, then this is it. I definitely recommend it."
4,Get it!,"This is a staple for your iconic collection along side Arrested Development, John Waters films and Mommie Dearest. Lisa Kudrow is incredible. The show is smartly written. It's very subtle. So if you like the Will Ferrell type of comedy, this is a little more sophisticated and may not be for you."
5,Brilliant! Hilarious! I never get tired of this.,This is one of the best shows I've ever seen. I discovered it years after it was cancelled when they were airing re-runs on HBO. I thought it was a new show and was shocked to find out it came and went. The great thing about this is it's only 2 discs/13 episodes. You can have a marathon party out of it which is why I do on occasion. Lisa Kudrow is brilliant in this and developed this totally amazing and funny character. I should warn that you will either love this or not care for it at all. I've shown this to friends who were jumping up and down with laughter and ended up running out to buy it as well. Then I had friends who simply could not be pulled in by it and didn't care for it all. You will have to assess for yourself what you enjoy.
5,Kudrow brings brains and painful honesty to reality TV,"In Lida Kudrow's short-lived HBO series ""The Comeback"" we are forced to watch former ""it-girl"" Valerie Cherish as she embarks on a comeback, playing a Mrs. Roper-style character in a jiggly comedy while appearing in her own reality TV show, The Comeback. It all strikes a little too close to home for television celebs, I think, and Kudrow isn't afraid to go to those uncomfortable places making us cringe even as we laugh. At the beginning of the series we're laughing at Valerie and her obvious attempts to make herself look good in the eyes of her fans from the past. By the time the first season wrapped, we were with her every step of the way, rooting for her triumph and feeling her pain. I'm so glad we're going to get this show on DVD... now if we can just have a second season?"
5,"An excellent, well crafted novel","I became a Martel fan after reading ""The Alternate"", but was not prepared for the level of excellence that this book presents. The off the wall beginning and ongoing plot twists are told with a humor and humanity that leave you reluctant to leave the story. Billy Strobe is a thoroughly original, totally engaging character,a sort of a cross between one with the strength, resolution and intelligence of ""The Firm""'s protagonist, touched with a bit of the naive quality and integrity of a Forrest Gump.The characters are well drawn, sympathetic and real, and the plot rolls.I finished this one and turned it over to my wife, saying here you go,lucky you."
3,Good Read,"Well paced novel. The humanity of the character draws you in to identify with the protagonist. The plot keeps things moving, worth the time all in all."
5,Easy to understand,"Out of all of the pharm books I have used, this is the easiest to understand. Not as thorough as some but great. I recommend it. Wish I had it for the whole nursing program."
5,Earth Blue,"Wonderful, relaxing CD. Also gave one to my massage therapist and all of the clients love it!"
3,"nothing special, but it's cheap so...","I have colognes for all occasions. Dates, friends, at work, at the club, just out of the shower.. just need something to smell nice. I've been using this Ice Dive as more in the need of the last two.Instead of a body splash, this cheap cologne smells nice and leaves me feeling clean after the body wash scent has faded from the shower. Many other times I just want to smell nice, be it to combat with body odors of myself or others or whatever reason, and in those cases you don't want to use your $100 bottle of Obsession. For that kind of scenario, I can recommend this Adidas scent. If you're looking for a signature date-scent, don't waste your time on this though. It smells sterotypical and un-unique. Not bad in any way, it's crisp and clean smelling, just not original enough to be that signature smell."
4,Love the scent but bottle sprayer broke!,"I have tried all the Adidas for men and this is by far my favorite because of the citrus, fruity sporty scent but the sprayer now just shoots out a stream rather then an equal spray so I have to spray it on my wrists of hand and rub it in. Other then that this ones a winner!"
1,big deal,"so so so so so,bad hum bug.lost cash again.one day will learn.so,so.bad.spare will not even spray and thats bad.so bad"
4,good stuff,"Not too strong, not too subtle. For the price, one of the best colognes you can get. It's got a fresh kick with a subtle sweetness and citrus scent behind it. Good for everyday use."
2,Its very very lite perfume.........,"It wont give any fragrance , but will stop the body odor with a small fragrance."
2,A.A. Attanasio - What happened?,"The Dragon and the Unicorn was nothing less than mind-blowing in scale and ambition. In contrast, The Eagle and the Crown was ...not. It maintained the same character names, and some of the same vocabulary, but without the worlds-spanning grand vision of the first book. The very chapters were longer and more majestic in the first work.Instead, this book is just a chapter at a time view of some greatly diminished characters, with comic relief at times by Merlin and others. The difference is night and day - as if Frank Herbert wrote the first book, and Brian Herbert cranked out the sequel.This book was OK in the ""I want to know what happened to the characters"" sense, but definitely did not scratch the same itch that the original book of the series did."
4,Good...but,"A really, really, new twist on an old legend. I enjoyed it and it was surely thought provoking.I found myself rooting for the bad guys ( Odin and his clan) half the time. I consider myself at least half way literate, but some of the descriptive words were way beyond my vocabulary. One other negative, you know how it's going to end, sorta."
3,Meh,"The Perilous Order of Camelot tries really, really, really hard to hack it at the level of epic fantasy and gets painfully close, but never quite makes it there. The characters are always a shade too flat, the settings a shade too cartoonish, the dialogue a shade too thin. Worth reading for the originality of the narrative despite the flawed execution."
3,"Have read the other 3, but. . .","I can't seem to find a copy of this one! I don't understand, because the other three are almost always available at the local bookstores. It's a great series, and it's upsetting to be missing the second of four books.Grumble. . . grumble. . ."
4,"ingeniously designed, some room for improvement","I love the way the ""zipper"" tool worked. I couldn't visualize it, but as soon as I tried it I was sold. The tube is designed so it slips easily over the cords when you use the tool, but it's hard to move with your fingers (the edges overlap a lot). I'm using it for my computer cables. I cut it into two pieces (VERY easy to cut with a craft knife or solid scissors), and I was able to really neaten things behind and next to my desk, but I tore my fingers up prying cables in and out of it by hand (because I have a complicated system and the cables are all different lengths and go to different places). It would be better, I think, for stereo cables that all go one place (like in the picture)."
1,Not worth the money spent.,"I really had problems with this program. It did not move my address book for MS Mail or my favorites and these were the most important files for me. I would not reccomend this program to anyone, I'd try to talk people out of buying it."
5,An Indispensible book,"Quite simply the best book/catalogue of it's type I have ever seen. The presentation of the book is good, as is the reproduction of the paintings. The short biographies of the artists are quite simply the brilliant, and contain more information than much longer articles. If you only have one book about late romantic art have this one."
3,"Good, but not THAT good.","I should preface my review by saying that I have not read any of the text yet and so have not considered that aspect in my rating. That said, I was really disappointed with this book. I am an artist and I appreciate visually stunning art books, but this is not one. Perhaps in 1989 (first edition) it would be acceptable to print so many black and white images in an art book, I'm not sure. But by 2008, it is almost inexcusable and really outdated. There seems to be about three b/w images per one in color. Really disappointing, and it certainly doesn't deserve the 5 stars it currently has. If there is a redeeming quality, it would be the inclusion of many lesser known British artists of the period whom I have never seen before."
4,Good for Day Hiking,"I just received my copy of ""Hiking Colorado's Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness."" It's a good guide for day hikes, but I was hoping for information on extended backpacking trails, in addition to the day hikes. Where, for example, is the Four Pass Loop Trail? That is one of the most popular extended backpacking trips, but it is not listed in this guide.But, as I said, this is an excellent guide book for day hiking."
5,Unbeatable Max Bygraves!,"This is the Ultimate Box-set that anyone could posess of Max Bygraves' amazing & outstanding easy-listening music/singalong medleys. His music is for all the music-lovers of such evergreen male vocalists as Andy Williams, Engelbert Humperdinck, Jim Reeves, Paul Anka, Dean Martin, Bing Crosby & Pat Boone.He has brought alive, in no small way, the songs that were very popular in the Post World War Years with his mellow singing, wonderful lyrics & great backgound musical accompaniments. Considering that the songs being played on the cds are from decades gone by, the audio quality of the cds is excellent. Just a few evergreen favourites included in this box-set, are 'Wonderful Copenhagen', 'Tulips from Amsterdam' & 'What a Wonderful World.'Enter the marvellous, magical world of Max Bygraves - believe me when I say that you will find it hard to leave it!"
2,"Rickover: Interesting Details, but Overlong","Worth reading if this is your area. The book describes Rickover as dominating, selfish, obsessed, power-hungry, dictatorial - but of immense value to our country because of the way he directed his ambitions. Interesting: How he exploited Congressmen to support him; how his superiors and peers despised him, yet envied his brilliance, how he interviewed and selected staff. Not interesting: Endless details on appropriations; differences between various sub propulsion designs. The book is solid and well-written, but unless you are interested in this arcane area, you can find more interesting biographies. And beware: Because this was unauthorized, Rickover and his staff did not participate and many of the inputs from others are of the vicious, jealous type, so the whole man does not come through in this book very well."
2,Scary for younger readers,"Some of the stories are really quite scary for younger readers who may be reading at a more advanced level. My 8yr old loves ghost tales, etc but I must say I was scaried when she began reading some of these to me as we were driving at night! She has talked about the story everyday since...luckily no nightmares, but could certainly cause some children to have nightmares so be careful!"
1,JJ's Review,"JJ's Review ofRailway ghosts and highway horrorsBy Daniel CohenI do not like this book because this book is not scary at all! The back says that it is a scary book but it is not.I picked this book because I thought it would be scary. It is a book that is not real. The short stories are about dead people and monsters that haunt people!This book is not scary. When the ghosts come they go quickly. The author does not tell you why the ghosts come. The ghosts have no story! The pictures are very boring. The headless guy is so stupid because there is nothing scary about how the author describes him. The book should say there's a bloody, murderous, freaky, headless monster. The book should have more information about the ghosts and monsters! This is why this book is so boring!I think no one should read this book because it is so boring and this book is bad! Very bad! If you hate this book, see my book review!"
5,The Neglected Scriabin: The Complete Mazurkas,"The Neglected Scriabin: The Complete Mazurkas is a 2003 Music & Arts recording starring pianist Eric Le Van. Eric Le Van has written the music notes and they are quite well written. On the cover it is written ""Terrific!"" and I totally agree. An amazing interpretation. Highly recommended. 5/5."
5,"Pianist, Piano, Composer and Listener all merge in Eric Le Van's Performance","I have listened to these pieces in countless places and circumstances - at home, in a plane, in my car, while in contemplation, focused on the road, in familiar surroundings or exotic foreign travel. Eric Le Van is somehow able to make me a part of the musical experience. It seems as though his intention is to enable me to merge my life experiences with the music and with little effort. It doesn't take me outside myself but rather, inside to a place of natural beauty."
3,Not bad quality - wrong size bolts.,"Pros: I liked the design of the hitch itself. Round tube, nicely curved.Cons: Paint was very thin and missing in some locations due to packaging. Had to bend the brackets (slightly) to get the holes to align. Biggest problem was the bolts supplied to secure the hitch to my 2005 Jeep liberty were 12mm. However the holes in the frame were 7/16"".Update: Contacted Valley Hitch support. Was told simply that the 12mm bolts are correct. Oh Well."
1,Indian hegamony,This is typical attempt to try to portray the poor indiansoldier as avalient fighter. The details appear mostly rhetoric and i wish the author had given more substantive and objective details and accounts.
1,Bad product at high price tag,"I bought the TV in 2005. In 2006 the remote went bad, I waited 6 weeks for the extended warranty company to send me a new remote. The remote died again 2 weeks ago. Without coverage it would be cheaper to scrap the TV than to fix it. All in all a very bad and unrelable expensive product."
4,Journey into imagination,"This eagerly awaited follow-up to ""Exile and the Heart"" is a collection of short stories exploring lesbian desire, sex, and love. The first half is populated with sensual erotica, ranging from love stories to kink. In the second half, Kobayashi adds elements of fantasy to her tales, merging the mythic with the erotic. ""Quixotic Erotic"" is a glorious example of reader seduction. Kobayashi is a marvelous storyteller and this collection just whets whatever appetites the readers bring. I hope it won't be so long before she gives us more."
3,MEDIA ROMANTICA,"DURANTE UN ARANQUE DE MIEDO POR LO QUE LA POLICIA PENSARIA Y POR EL PAPELEO QUE HABIA QUE LLENAR EL ABANDONA A UB HERIDO EN EL MEDIO DE LA CARRETERA AUQUE REGRESA A AYUDARLO ALGUIEN ,MAS LO HABIA HECHO Y ELLA SUFRE UNA DESEPCION QUE ABANDONA COMPLTAMENTE SU CUERPO YDUFRE UN CHOCK QUE LO OVLIGA A DEMOSTRARLE QUE EL NO ES COMO ELLA CREE PARA RECUPERAR SU AMOR"
3,Pan Am,"The first several chapters were boring, I found the interesting information in the last three chapters. I am aware of Pan American Airlines long history. I believe the writers were harsh in their characterization of Juan Trippe. Guess you just have to understands the fierce competetion of those early days."
3,good midweight union suit,"I've been buying and wearing these for a few years now. They are a real nice mid-weight union suit. Not so heavy that you can't move around, but heavy enough to keep you warm. If you are working outside all day, you may want a heavier one. If you are just in a cool building, or if you are in and out all day, this is the one you want. The only problem I have with them is the stitching on the buttons. It seems to be very loose. Whenever I buy a new one, I give it right to my wife so she can sew all the buttons on really well. Without this, there would be a button or two rolling around the bottom of the dryer after only a couple washes. I've had that happen on 2 different ones. Aside form that, these are still a good buy. I try to keep an eye on them and grab one whenever they go on sale."
2,"good model, but poor quality of photography and editing","This DVD earns 5 stars for the model, but 1 star for the quality of footage and editing at scarcely amateur level, moreover is very short and not the 2 hours on the video jacket."
1,Propagandized Self-Righteous B.S.,"If you look at what Bob says above he states that, ""this book resulted from my 20+ years of interest in the issue of ufo's"". Obviously he didn't do any research in those 20+ years, instead he watched a few episodes of Star Trek, watched the movie ET, went on Oprah, and read an article in Time magazine. Wow this man is a learned ufologist.What makes me most mad is that he thinks popular culture is to blame for increased UFO interest during the past few decades. He blames Star Trek, Star Wars, ET, and whatever else might be on the TV. Well if he knew anything about anything then he'd know that Star Trek isn't about ufo's or government conspiracies. After all the first UFO sightings occured well before any Star Trek episode ever aired.This whole book is just one big attempt to falsify or debunk the UFO phenomenom. No facts, no research, no logic, no rationalization, just his jaded Christian opinion of aliens."
1,Another glorified book report,"Bob Larson is a self-taught, self-styled, self-involved B.S. artist who has proclaimed himself to be an ""expert"" on rock music, Satanism, the occult, or whatever happens to be ""hot"" at any given moment. Larson is a man without any known credentials -- a mail-order media minister, who dropped out of the University of Nebraska, and has never set foot inside a bona fide seminary. He has no meaningful expertise to impart, either in the area of UFOs or anywhere else, and this latest in his series of quick for-cash book reports shows the lack of depth for which he is renowned."
1,Congratulations!,...You've come across possibly the worst UFO book in the world.Certainly the worst I've ever encountered.
1,Terrible return policy for damaged item!,"I purchased two of these blades after searching for flat grind ripping blades. Upon receiving them I checked them over and found that one blade had a chipped tooth. The shipping package had no damage to it and the blades were well wrapped, so I could only conclude that the chip was missed by factory inspectors. I contacted Magnate and was given a RMA number. I figured they would also credit me for the cost to ship the item back. Wrong! They don't refund returning shipping charges! I don't think it's fair that I have to shell out more money to ship the damaged item back. This was their screw up. Needless to say, I won't be doing business with them anymore, and I will be a lot more careful with which companies (selling through Amazon) that I buy products from."
3,Honey Wheat Pretzels,"This is a pretty good quality product, but kind of dry & needing (in my opinion) just a tad more salt."
2,"One star for crunch, one star for shape","These pretzels were absolutely horrid. They had a pronouced burnt taste from start to finish. Oh, and where's the honey? Quite a disappointment."
4,Great snack!,I originally bought these pretzels for my son to take to daycare. My husband likes them so much that he takes them to work also. They are very tasty and crunchy -- a very refreshing snack.
3,"bland, but ok","I ordered these pretzels as an organic alternative, since my kids eat a lot of pretzels. I like them, but the kids won't eat them. I think it's because they are unsalted, and taste pretty bland at first. After eating a few, the honey flavor is more apparent. They are great with dips, and even taste good dipped in cream cheese when dips aren't available. Unfortunately, they're sort of an acquired taste when eaten alone."
2,An angry patriot talks,"This book consists of a series of conversations between the journalist Elisabeth Schemla and the Algerian feminist Khalida Messaoudi. The conversations are organized into chapters according to topic. It is most interesting for the general reader when Messaoudi is describing her childhood and education. Later chapters focusing on her political struggles require the reader to have extensive background knowledge of modern Algerian politics in order to make sense of them. The repeated use of abbreviations in the book tends to be rather annoying for readers who aren't familiar with Algerian politics. They are explained in a glossary at the end. If you want an insider's view of Algerian politics of 1980s and 1990s, you must read this book. If you are simply looking for tales of an ordinary woman's life (or even an extraordinary woman's life) in Algeria, you'll need to look elsewhere."
5,History we all lived through,"Mr. Flamm skillfully takes us through the history of the urban unrest in our major cities in the '60's.Having lived through the era, it is fun to review all the events that changed us forever and led to rise of the Republican Party andtheir conservative agenda.Well worth a read."
4,Technical Details Incorrect,Well ppackaged and still a good value but be aware that the trchnical details which at the time of writing this says 350 labels per roll. Even though the Item Title says 520 total. I ordered on the chance that the tech details were correct. The actual is 260 labels per roll and 520 labels total between the 2 rolls.
5,Good price for Labels,Price at amazon with this vendor was about 50% of the price of staples. Product was well packaged and arrived quickly.
1,Upgrade to ripoff,"Here is how it works...you buy this product for about 350 bucks. It immediately limits you to 10 nodes (computers that can be connected to the device) and blocks out the rest. They do not tell you this in the sales materials. Even the cheapest routers do not block out computers trying to connect to the router. They include 5 SecurRemote licenses, but the device will allow you to use only two without their 500 buck ""power pack"" upgrade. Here is what happens when D-Link partners with a companies that focus on ripping you off...Check Point and Sofaware. The only goal of this product is to get you to sink hundreds and hundreds more dollars into it to get a product that will work in a small office. Want to hook in your printer for the print serve function? Not likely, because most likely it does not match their secret list of printers that will work. Total RIPOFF. Stay clear of this one."
3,Not as good as Sofa boxes,"Site to site VPN works like charm (limited to 2 only)I had 5 public IP addresses, it is unable to use the other ones as it somehow fails due to TCP Spoofing (I don't know why it happens and this is not my first time). When I use FW IP with port forwarding same thing works.But this is the cheapest sofaware box you can purchase with Wireless."
2,Pretty Flimsy,"Nice design, but these plate racks are flimsy. The mounting bracket fell off while I was trying to hang it on the wall, and so I had to rig something up."
5,Great,These plate racks were cute. The only thing is they do not come with hardware to mount them to the wall.
4,a great movie fun for the whole family,I just got done watching black lighting and i must say that i was very impressed with the way the film carried itself. granted their are some things that you will noticed in the movie like elements of superman and iron man. i do not want to give to much away but if you are a fan of superhero movies then i encourage you to watch this movie you will not be disappointed! one thing i will say is that this movie goes to show that hollywood is not the only ones who can make a really great superhero movie. this one is not to be missed.
2,Nice but scratched,"It's a really nice watch, but unfortunetly the white strap was scratched one i received the watch. i even thought it was a second hand one."
2,chips,Love the watch but the white paint chips quickly. So I cannot wear it anymore. Only had for a month.
4,NICE WATCH,"IT IS A REALLY NICE WATCH, INCREDIBLE. EVERYBODY LOOKS AT YOUR WRIST. IT IS LIKE THE PICTURE BUT MORE BIGGER."
5,Guess Watch,I LOVE MY WATCH AND HAVE NOT FOUND IT CHEAPER EVEN IN THE ISLANDS AND I WORK IN GOOD JEWELERY
4,great watch,this watch is beautiful and I constantly get compliments on it and a lot of people ask where to get one. I have bought two as gifts for my friends and unfortunetly one of the watches came scratched and one of the pins feel out and she is having a hard time getting it fixed. The other one as well as mine is great!!
4,Bible study of the Apostles,We have a small church group that meets in our home every two weeks and we study something about the Bible. Our group wanted to study the Apostles of Jesus and in looking for a book we came across this one. We ordered several from Amozon and they were delivered faster then was promised. We spent a great deal of time on this study because it was so interesting and the book was so helpful in getting the talking going. It also really peaked our interest to find out more. Easy to read and presented in a helpful format.
2,Don't Do It,Buy the one with the corduroy panel. That is a good dress which is complimented everywhere I wear it. The calico dress is not of the quality which the price demands in your money or time ironing.
4,Good book for beginning CAD students,"Our architecture instructor advised us of this book to get started in CAD design. Recommend this to new students who wish to dig into the program. Covers fundamental basics to R14 as well as provide a solid foundation to build from. Book does great job of addressing difficult areas such as plotting, layering, and scaling functions."
3,Inspiring Guy / So-so book,"Kyle is absolutely amazing, there is no doubt about that. After seeing him on television, I was interested in reading his book. I found his writing was way too much about wrestling. Clearly the guy is focused on what he does (wrestling)! I think that's very inspiring and admirable, but it got boring for me personally to read about. I would have liked to hear about how he coped with other aspects of his life a little bit more: dating, the prom, eating, earning money (wasn't that a concern for him as a teenager?) etc. It's possible he doesn't find those things interesting, but I would have. For this mom, No Excuses left a lot to be desired."
4,Motivational,Get book to get you up and going no matter what your problems are. Especially good for teenagers or young people.
4,Great example,"Inspiring and challenging, strong message of independence and selfsteem, highly recomended to inspire teams and push people to achieve their goals."
5,A Must read,This is an amazing story and I hope everyone has a chance to read this story about an amazing young man. I hope all of us develop his determination in life
3,Great story,"This book does have a nice story about how Kyle beat the odds, and having attended Collins Hill High and shared a weight lifting class with Kyle almost 3 years ago now, its safe to say I know him more than the average person who would read this book. He is a very determined person and didn't let anything get him down, and even made his own way to lift weights to work the same muscles as any normal person, but the person Kyle is, is not exactly the person potrayed in the book. Based on the fact that I knew him personally and experienced his story on the sidelines just watching, I can tell you this book isn't completley true. Sorry Kyle, you're a good guy, but I don't by this story, and thats why I give it 3 stars"
4,An Inspiration,Kyle's story is one that helps you to believe in love of family and power of the human spirit.
4,A true champion in life,"I just finished this book, and I'm planning on recommending it to everyone! I've never met Kyle personally, but after reading this inspirational biography, he's at the top of my list of people I admire and aspire to be more like. He shows that no matter what limitations you may face in life, you can accomplish anything with faith (in God AND in yourself) and determination. What a class act!"
5,Fantastic Rise,"Kyle Maynard is a boy born without arms and legs. His parents don't allow him the luxury of self-pity, and he learns first to survive, and then to thrive. He learns to be an effective football player, and then a state contending wrestler and champion weight lifter.The story is less about being a champion in wrestling, than life. It is also about parents supporting a child to face life as it is, to not expect handouts or sympathy. Any non-wrestler can learn from Kyle's no-excuses attitude towards facing adversity."
1,Out of date - Save your money,"A very, very weak effort.. this was out of date when 2001 started!It amazes me that the ""new"" 2001 version of Fodor's Carribean (""Completely Updated Every Year"" it says on the cover) has a review of the Kadushi Cliffs (closed for over a year) and Princess Beach (try Radisson for months now) resorts in Curacao..The book also makes numerous references to Air Aruba (out of business since October)..Save your money"
4,One of the best full color Robin Hood Spin Offs,"The Bandit of Sherwood Forest is one of the best full color Robin Hood Spin offs. It's worth watching more than once, and has a tricky clever plot. However, where did the merry men get all of those horses (from the cavalry movies?), and how come they still look as young as Robin Hood's son. In all of these children of Robin Hood movies one gets the impression that everyone can find the Fountain of Youth except Robin and Marion. Nevertheless, Cornel Wilde movies are usually pretty good, and I include this one. But unless you have insomnia, avoid, ""Prince of Thieves"" with Jon Hall (He's much better as Kit Carson.)"
3,Go To Town with Billy May,"The selection of tunes are good. Performed in the easy Billy May style unfortunately the audio quality is poor which detracts from the listening experience. On the other hand there are two cds in the set,46 tracks. I just wish the sound was better."
1,Rip off,"The description says ""Product Dimensions: 5 x 2.5 x 2.5 inches ; 3.2 ounces "" makes you think you are buying a 3.2 ounce jar, it's only 1 oz. Very very upset. If it wasn't for local pet shops not selling this I'd demand a refund and ship this falsely described item back."
5,Excellent...,"...memory, excellent price. It arrived a couple days later than expected, but during the holidays that was to be expected. Installed without a hitch into my Sony VAIO PCG-R505GL laptop and performs as expected."
3,Too tight,"Shoes are a bit tight. Can't really wear them so I'm trying to find them a new home. My left foot likes them, but not my Right."
5,Great set of Party CDs!,"These 3 CDs can be played back to back for a great background to an island party. Mix of Jimmy Buffett and other artists, with upbeat songs. Our guests couldn't tell it wasn't THE Buffett! Get it, you won't be dissapointed if you enjoy this type of music."
5,Great Book,"I used this book for high school trig, and it its excellent. It is clear and concise, easy to understand. It includes real life applications, and has interesting chapter projects. I would reccomend this book immensely to any one taking trig."
4,Advanced Mathematical Concepts,Received the book in a timely manner and was in better shape than led to believe by the description. Happy about this purchase and will purchase more in the future.
2,bad book binding,"The textbooks were said to be in very good condition, and one of them came completely detached from the binding. These books are for use by highschool students, and that book cannot be used."
1,Poor Poor Poor.......,Never received this item. I was taken for the cost of the item and shipping. Very diappointed
2,Thing's aren't always what they seem,"I ordered this finance book two weeks before classes started and I got it in a very timely fashion. However the book I recieved was the international version, something that may have been my mistake but there is a huge yellow sticker on the front with a disclaimer stating that it is illegal to sell or purchase this book in North America. When I tried to return the book I emailed the seller and s/he never emailed me back. Now i'm stuck with a book that can't be bought or sold because it's illegal. This experience changed my whole view on online purchasing."
4,Awesome Deal,"Great purchase for the money, could not have found a better deal. Will continue looking for similar deals on text books in the future."
4,Good book,"This is a good book. Chapters are well organized, and you may even skip some chapters without having problem understanding the whole book.I bought it from amazon place. Seller claimed the book is new, but sent me an old book. Amazon covered all the costs."
4,A little too detailed for beginners,"The financial concepts are explained very nicely. Though it is my first finance book i can go through it without much difficulty or extra help. However there are still some drawbacks need to be noticed:1. Need more charts and graphics to explain the concepts, ie: when explaining the DU PONT System, i think the pyramid structure can be illustrated so as to state a whole concept, not only fragments2. Too many examples3. This book is too detailed in both relevant and irrelevant mattersStill, I think it is a good book."
2,Not like new and I can't sell it back,I purchased this book like new. I expected some minimal writing but in the later chapters there was highlighting and LOTS of writing. Now I cannot sell it back for credit. The book did come on time and the outside is much like new. But now what do I do with it since I finished the class? Buyer beware and look completely through the books if you plan to sell them back.
5,My favorite coffee table book!,"The American Dream Towns 2004 book is a little pricy, that's why I bought it. We are discovering America in a different way. What an excellent idea to let people vote what towns are featured! Congrats, why didn't anyone else think of that before? We are waiting for the 2005 edition. Irene from a little American dream town in Texas."
4,Smaller than I envisioned,Looks just like the picture. I should have paid better attention to the size description. I'm not sure this will be super visible on the bumper of a car.
1,Lame contribution...,"This is a perfect way to make money out of famous people.I wonder how the Beasties granted the permissions to use their words and pictures.Don't buy this book. If you are a fan or like the Beastie Boys, go to www.beastiemania.com and find ALL about them."
1,.... just too hard to navigate....,"The author may have done some good research, but this book is WAY too ""messed-up"" to try to read! As other reviewers have said - just too many misspelled words; punctuation errors; etc... grossly poor editing, thru and thru...Get a PROFESSIONAL editor, and re-release/re-issue it... maybe then..."
3,Good,The customer service was very good. Was a fast delivery and a fast refund. Product was poor it customer service was good. I would order from the again.
1,Not worth the price,Purchased for clie PJ25. Disappointed when I saw my clie inside. I find item offers little protection for the pda. The item is not worth $39.99.....$3.99 would be a reasonable price.
5,Deborah Hale at her finest.,"We have come to expect the best from Deborah and she never disappoints. Not the usual hero, it doesn't take us long to see why Jenny can't help but fall in love with Harris. When Harris finally takes her down from the pedestal he placed her on, he finds life will not be complete without her.Ms. Hales characters come alive on the page. Her description is weaved in so beautifully that we find outselves wanting to go where they've been to see for ourselves. Another book for your keeper shelf and a definite 5+."
1,Close to worthless unless you have had elementary training,"If you are a secondary teacher be prepared for a text that assumes you already know the material presented in the text. The writing is disjointed-completely disorganized. The early chapters look like a series of essays that have been strung together. There is a complete lack of continuity. References are made to outdated research and comparison between a variety of studies are invalid. The text is a difficult read. The author seems to find ways to express simple ideas in difficult language. If you are required to read this text as part of a class, be prepared to set aside a lot of time for re-reading and highlighting. While the text is about reading, the art of writing seems to be lost."
5,Worked well on 2008 Chevy Trailblazer,"I purchased this device to retain my factory chimes when installing a Clarion double din head unit in my 2008 Chevy Trailblazer. The instructions were well written, and the wiring harness for installing the stereo is included with the device, pre-wired with the connector for the retention device itself, so it is not necessary to buy an additional wiring harness. As in many other reviews, they recommended cutting the portion of the circuit board (just solder between two holes in the board and it clearly marked) and covering the front of the speaker cover with duct tape. I followed these recommendations and the volume of the chime is identical to the factory. And the device dimensions are slightly larger than I thought they would be, but still, there was ample room to the left of the radio in the dash to zip tie it to the interior of the dashboard. Excellent product."
4,Does the job,"Walked into a Fry's electronics and they wanted over $100 bucks for this thing. Told the Fry's guy I wanted to scan it and check out the reviews and there is it for a fraction of the price, one button away and bam! purchased, Sorry dude from Fry's.The device works at stated, Chime is supper loud though i would recommned cover the speaker grill with a bit of electrical tape other wize its so loud its annoying. It is what it is, some wires a plug and a plastic casing for the small chime speaker."
3,worked in a 2004 tahoe,"installed in a 2004 chevy tahoe (without on-star or bose) for a head unit upgrade (Pyle PLDN74BTI). as previous reviewers noted, it is loud, but effective. door chimes and retained accessory power work as it did with the previous head unit. wish it wasnt as expensive as it was to keep those features..."
4,"Worked as described, TAPE OVER SPEAKER GRILL!","This harness and chime retention worked exactly as described. All of the reviews regarding the volume of the unit are accurate. It is EXTREMELY loud. There are instructions detailing how to cut a small solder path on the circut board to knock the volume down. Don't hesitate! Just do it. I then wrapped the entire box with electrical tape covering all but one slot in the speaker grill of the module. With these modifications and the module itself stuffed deep within my dashboard, it now matches the volume of the original chimes that came from the driver door speaker. (2004 Suburban)."
4,Good product,"I bought this for my 2003 impala. plugs right into your factory harness, just splice the wires from your new cd player harness into it and plug the module in. i almost made the mistaake of buyin a gm wiring harness because i thought this was just the door chimes, so to anyone who dont kno, just buy this and its all you need. hope this helps! glad i looked on here and saved a little xtra money. didnt really seem too loud so i have nothin to complain about"
2,Chime Sounds Horrible,"I put this in my 2004 Tahoe with a Clarion Navigation System. The harness alone works just like it should. But the Chime sounds horrible. Nothing close to the stock chime which was very pleasant compared to this cheap piece of junk. Loud, obnoxious and unnatural. I wish I could say don't buy it, but i don't think anyone else makes this. And for that reason i gave this two stars.I also want to add that this product is not worth $50 (let alone $90 from other retailers) because of the very poor quality of it. Its just a few wires attached to a cheap speaker."
5,installing new stereo with chime interface.,"This item arrived on time, and brand new.It was excactly what was advertised, and excactly what I needed.A+bigdaddy"
2,"received used product, suppose to be new.","This box was shipped to me in what appeared to be used condition. I did not get a users manual, or any instructions. the bag in come in was open, and taped back shut. I decided i should test with a multi volt meter to make sure the 12 volt supplied accessory wire was providing 12 volts, in which it was not. it was sending 9 to 10 volts. Guessing this is why it was pre opened. I double checked battery voltage, and battery showed 13.6 volts. Went to local car stereo store, and bought a new one. No fuss, no problems. hooked right up, worked fine. returning the product purchased from here."
5,Does the trick!,"If you need one of these (check Metra's website first), it works fine. I used it to install aJVC KW-XR810 Double-DIN Bluetooth Dual USB/CD Receiver with USB 2.0 for iPod/iPhone, and Bluetooth/Satellite/HD Radio add-on capabilityin my 2002 Pontiac Grand Am. This chime retention interface is very loud. The instructions provided with the unit show how to lower the volume, but you have to cut a circuit on the circuit board, which I easily did with a razor blade. A bit annoying and very permanent, but it does the trick, and the chime sounds exactly the way it did with the original factory radio."
5,Purchased for my 2004 Colorado,"I replaced the head unit (radio) in my Colorado and used this to retain the chime and accessory power. It works well and the chime is actually louder than the original chime it replaced. You connect this to your radio wiring harness. I mounted it to the left of the dashboard cavity where the radio sits, which is essentially the plastic frame of the dashboard."
4,Axxess GMRC-01 Class II GM Chime Retention Interface,"Exactly what was needed to retain my system chime after replacing the GM factory stereo.The only difference is that the chime now sounds a little muted as opposed to the ""crisp"" sounding chime I had previously. Also, the stereo won't actually start playing until the chime stops ringing. FYI."
4,Worked well for me,Circuit City 'forgot' to install this when I bought my aftermarket radio but made good 'after the fact'. Bottom line is I got to see how my new radio worked with and without this unit. All GM functions now work however I am not happy with the extra loud default volume (Amtrak could use it in locomotives) and the fact I have to go into the unit and cut a wire to set it to lower volume. For the price you would think there would be a easily accessable switch!
4,Jade claw,Very good movie with billy chong. One problem the movie like to stop about 25 minutes into the movie and I have to restart it all over just to get the movie to play all the way threw. But otherwise a very entertaining movie of kung fu fans.
5,"Now, that's what I call music","This album represents the brilliant early years of house, garage, latino, speed (call it what you like). Sasha's aggressive pounding drumbeat mixed with the era's melodic hoppy keyboardy style is breathtaking. It is a golden age of music before this kind of music became commercially orientated, where the packaging of the CD is greater than musical content. CJ's music is excellent, however, a different style to Sasha. I suspect that back in the golden days of the early nineties, the record company tried to appeal to all devotees by including two great DJs. Every style of music has that wonderful moment, when the possibilities seem endless, this is Mixmag's finest hour."
3,Not recommended for beginner,I found this book hard to follow without having already participated in a Pilates mat class....
1,Disappointed,I love Pilates and have several books on the subject. I would have thought the person initiating the law suit would have had a much better book on his subject. I feel I wasted my money on the item. There are far to many good Pilates books around then to waste money on this book. Not enough of the excerises are presented - there are far more beginner excerises which should have been included. This book is incomplete at best.
3,"Good overview, but not ideal for building a home practice","This book provides a good overview of the Pilates method for those interested in learning about performing a wide range of Pilates movements using various types of Pilates equipment. However, because the average Pilates practitioner is unlikely to purchase most of the equipment featured, this book is less effective for those looking to build a home-based Pilates practice consisting mainly of matwork. The information provided is clear and datailed, and as always, the photographs of Joseph Pilates at various ages are inspiring. Still, most casual Pilates enthusiasts are likely to derive more practical information from a book such as Brooke Siler's The Pilates Body."
2,There are much better Pilates books than this one,Get 'The Pilates Body' by Brooke Siler not this book.
2,A big advertisment for their equipment,"The pictures & descriptions are okay if you're beginning but if you want to learn more advanced exercises then you are forced to buy another book, probably by Gallagher as well. There are many other companies out there selling merchandise and books but they are not allowed to advertise themselves under the pilates name because Gallagher has copyrighted the name. Sorry, but I'm not willing to invest thousands into the equipment that he is pushing which is why I opted for the book in the first place. I have since learned that there are many other resources out there to learn the method from & I'm disappointed by the author's attempt to confine readers to his book and his products."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"This book might help reinforce things learned in the studio, but is not a substitute for good instruction. It would be practically impossible to read this book and do the exercises correctly. Studying with a certified instructor is the best way to learn the method and avoid injury.This book perpetuates the myth of not breaking a sweat. I am a beer drinking, meat eatin', cigar smoker (much like Joe Pilates was reputed to be) and I've managed to sweat a few decades of toxins out of my system during workouts."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"I so feel ripped off. My fault, it is one page of nothing important!!!! Please don't buy this. You would get more from a google search. Why is this on Amazon. I thought I was buying a full e-book but I got one page of some simple links."
2,Get a real dictionary of philosophy,"If you want a single dictionary of philosophy I'd recommend getting a more authoritative text such as Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy. Flipping through it some of the entries appear to be substantial (several pages), but none of the 6 items I've looked up so far have been in the Dictionary (including Postmodernism, Logical Positivism, and Correspondence Theory of Truth)."
3,"great songs, but could have been better","I grabbed this cd because I do not own every cd by Big Moe and this compilation seemed to have a good balance of songs I have & have not heard. But as I listened, I noticed there were ""skits"" that were not really skits & several tracks that were poorly recorded and sound as if they had been taken from the old cassettes from the Dj Screw days. Overall they should have cut out the filler & made this an 11 to 12 track masterpiece that really would have showed off the quality of Big Moe's music."
3,Interesting.,"It was a little slower than I expected, but it was a good book. I have read some of this that have been better."
4,R. I. P.,"R.I.P. gave a new meaning to RIP... ""Til We Meet Again.What a sad occassion but the threesome found that truefriendship can last and make it's way back thru thickand thin.I enjoyed reading this stoy of a deep friendship between three good girlfriends ( Reshondra, Indigo, Priscilla ) and one guy( Walter ) friend.The love ,death and their lives proved that they could later weather the storm.I will admit I was disappoint with Priscilla's decision in the end . I did not think Marlon deserved another chance. Maybe she did it for the kids which would be the only good reason.I just did not have the faith that he had reformed.She had so much love to waste on Marlon. I wanted her to find some one more deserving."
5,R.I.P. - A MUST READ,"""Bold and Sassy . . . Wonderfully written . . . Honest, Bittersweet and a novel that will touch the soul of men and women. Waiting in anticipation for Ms. Wash's next book!"
4,"Smart, engaging rock","NYC rock trio Microdot's inital offering to the world brings seven heady rock songs that blend cool guitar riffs with catchy, uptempo songs. The songs range from straight-ahead rock (Hourglass) to powerpop (How Much for the X-Ray, boasting a very catchy chorus) to some other moodier Pixies/Who influenced rock leanings. Worth your time if you're a fan of classic guitar rock/pop."
1,Got screwed!!!,"This is clearly labeled a ""half height"" product. I bought it for a gift and was embarassed when it turned out to be a full height burner."
1,"Works great - while it works, which isn't long.",I had this drive in my computer about 2 months and had burned about 30 dvds when it started making a grinding noise and no longer worked. I sent it back to Lite-On (at a shipping cost I had to pay of almost $10) and they sent me a completely new drive. Again it worked great right out of the box... for about a month. I had only burned 20 - 30 dvds when this one started making a grinding noise as well and quit working. So far Lite-On has not responded to my request to send me a shipping label so I can send this one back as well - I will not spend another $10 on a product that won't last more than a couple months so I will probably do what I will suggest anyone else looking for a dvd burner to do - spend a little more money and get a quality burner.
2,product didnt work right and company wouldnt back it up,Wouldnt buy from this bunch again. The product was given as a gift. My son took it home first week of January when their Christmas visit was over. Couldnt get the scribing process to work. Was told to contact the manufacturers to fix the problem which he did and they couldnt fix. Then he tried to return via Amazons instructions and after hassling with that was told only the original purchaser could return it and so he asks me to see about it. I am told when I contact antonline that its been to long (january 22nd) to return the merchandise. Most responsible companies extended their return deadlines for Christmas and some dont even have one. Wont do business with manufacturer or Antonline again. Having problems with other amazon merchant returns too and may stop using amazon all together except that I use their credit card alot. Guess that can be changed too.
1,Looking for a book with good examples? Not this one,"I'm about half way through this book and its poor. The idea is good but the examples are full of security holes and the companion website still has ""coming soon"" messages for some of the source code.Some examples are supposed to be written in C# but switch to VB half way through. These are not best practices. It appears the author cares more about getting the next version out than supporting this version. DONT BUY THIS BOOK."
5,brad nails,"i needed these 1 3x8 inch brad nails for my porter cable 18 gauge brad nailer.they are exactly what i needed, excellent quality"
2,Not brown heads as advertised.,"I received this item that was advertised to have brown heads...they were silver, I returned them for replacement, got the same ones the next day. Decided to keep them, not worth sending them back again. Really needed the brown ones as I am using them in stained projects."
5,Perfect,Just as expected and the perfect size for an assortment that will fit inside of the nail guns case for whatever comes up.
2,Not Brown Headed Brads As Advertised,"Stanley-Bostitch screwed this one up. Amazon.com pulled (twice) from two different inventory locations the boxes with the correct stock # on them for these 18 gauge brown headed 1 3/8"" brads but both ended up containing standard silver heads--which is a problem for us in better hiding the head into stained wood trim. Bottom line: Stanley-Bostitch put standard silver brads into packaging boxes which had the BT1335-B (brown) stock listing. I contacted Stanley and they confirmed that the BT1335-B should be brown."
5,True Grace,Excellent book about Good's grace gift! Jeffress hits the bullseye describing misuse of the grace gift. I have been a Bible teacher for many years and believe in salvation through faith once saved always saved. Grace Gone Wild! opened my eyes and caused me to search the scriptures where I found that the author thoroughly understands grace and his book hits the target. I am a director of women's ministries at my church and I will recommend this book as a study guide. This is a must read!
1,Superficial,"Please don't buy this book. It is just a waste of money. The information is very superficial and will be of no use. Buy ""Mosaic: Techniques and Traditions"" and ""The encyclopedia of mosaic techniques"" to start working with mosaics.This is not at all a mosaic bible."
1,BIG disappointment!,If you[re looking for a mosaic book with good information this is NOT it. There are some photos of nice projects but that's all. Pretty boring and not worth buying
3,"A few decent ideas, but otherwise it's Blah.","I was hoping that this book would have some really great inspirational ideas, things I hadn't seen before, things that would get my creative juices flowing. Instead it was a good tool for a beginning, but nothing new."
2,"Limited and disappointing, perhaps mislabled as a ""bible"" for artists","A mosaic artist's ""bible"" should cover, or at least refer to, all things mosaic. I found this to be more of a craft-oriented, paint-by-numbers book of patterns, not geared to artists. I suppose the patterns may be helpful for those who do not create their own designs but if that's not what you're after, this book not only doesn't offer anything new, it doesn't even touch on many of the most important mosaic materials and techniques, so the title is very misleading. This book never once refers to smalti, the most basic and historic of tesserae, not does it discuss any artistic techniques, such as visual flow(andemento) or outlining. The words ""bible"" and ""artist's"" should not be in the title, maybe more ""how-to"" for beginners."
5,Must have,This is perfect for quick technique. It has practical design that can be imitated or exaggerated into fine art. Letters and numbers are made creatively. Plenty of ideas that will be a great help. Mine is full of sticky notes!
5,Terrific little folded dive map!,"Gee, we used our Franko map of Kauai every day during our stay and thought it was lovely. It's printed on what feels like a smoother and thicker version of Tyvek (like those envelopes from Fed Ex that are practically indestructible), with the folds permanently in place. It's not laminated -- and I don't know how you'd laminate a folded map without turning it into a placemat -- but water (and soda and fruit juice, all of which we spilled on it) rolls right off.It's not a road map, but that's what the freebie ones at the airport or AAA are about. This map did lead us to every good snorkel site on Kauai, without having to call any dive shops.No map is all things to all people, but I will definitely look for a Franko map when I go to Maui this winter."
2,Poorly made,"The listing says ""Printed on waterproof, tear-resistant, permanently folded paper."" In reality it is printed on flimsy stock and is not laminated. The map itself is ok, but not exceptionally detailed. Certainly not worth the price."
1,Never received it.,"I ordered the Accent on Achievement book 1 for saxophone and it was supposed to come with a cd. When I received my package, I received the cd and not the book. When I sent an email asking for just the book to be sent to me, I received a response stating that I needed to return the cd and a new set (book and cd) would be mailed to me. When I received the second package, I again received just a cd and not the book. Since it was taking so long for my son to receive his book and cd for band at school, I had to go with another company to buy these items. I have since returned both cd's and I'm waiting for a refund. I am not sure why this keeps happening but it has been a very frustrating experience."
1,Wrong book.,"I specifically selected Clarinet B Flat and received Percussion version of this booklet. Was very disappointed and so was my child when she brought the product to school and realized it was the wrong version. Make sure that if you order this item to highlight and be specific, even write a comment so the sender does not send the wrong one! It wasn't worth my aggravation to return it. I ended up paying full price at a book store! Ugh!"
3,"As ""source material"", it's fine, but...","The fact that this is a translation by Summers is a bit off putting. However, if you do yourself the favor of skipping the Introduction, you can view this book for what it is: Source material for the basis of the persecution of people whose only crime was that they were ""different"". Many of the people who fell victim to the ""Witch Hunters"" who relied on the Malleus Maleficarum as their ""guiding light"" were executed because of the ignorance of Mssrs Kramer and Sprenger.While I don't believe this book to be ""evil"", it certainly does do a good job of showing how evil man can be due to ignorance. Anyone doing research into Witchcraft Trials or the persecution of Witches would do well to have this book as part of their research collection as it was the basis for all the ""Witch Hunters Bibles"" that followed."
3,The Mein Kemf of The Middle Ages,"Anyone who reads this book in an attempt to understand witchcraft or to battle it is desperately in need of help.That being said, this book should be approached in much the same way that one should approach reading Mein Kemf, and other such ""taboo"" works. This book IS, after all, one of the most blood-stained works in history, its pages have been responsible for countless deaths. One should read it with the mindset of learning about how people in the ""burning times"" thought."
4,a retraction,"I wrote a previous review stating that the bible condemned witchcraft. I received many negative votes to those who did not find my review helpful. My understanding of witchcraft is dealing with the devil. However it has come to my attention that witches do not even believe in a devil. The term ""witchcraft"" then must mean something else than the term used in the bible. This being so then my previous review was in error. I sincerely apologize to any pagans or anyone else who was offended by the review."
1,A Catholic apologizes for her church,"Dear Wiccans and pagans, I am a Catholic. I love my Church and believe her teachings, but wish to apologize with all my heart for those like the writers of this book, and some of those who have written reviews here, who hate you so much. I would like to remind all Catholics that our Pope, John Paul II, has asked us to apologizing for the sins committed by our Church during the past millennium, and in that spirit I write this. We don't have to agree on religious doctrine -- in fact, we will probably NEVER agree on many important issues -- but may the evils committed as a result of this book NEVER happen again."
3,History's worst book,"This book is something of an oddity. It's interesting because of it's impact on history, though completely laughable for it's inaccuracies on witchcraft. Buyer beware, there is a lot of Latin, which tends to make this a boring read. If you are into oddities, or history, I would suggest this book."
4,"Excellent work, great minds!!",This book is a must have for the Medieval Christian. Excellent work and such awesome intelligence!!
5,SUPER speedy shipping!,"This product arrived within 3 days of ordering, packaged very carefully to protect the product. The book is in PERFECT condition, glossy cover, crisp pages, no marks or folded corners. EXACTLY what I was looking for. MUCH better quality than I was expecting for the price, a really great deal. I will definitely buy from this seller again!"
2,Not quite what I expected,"The item was very well packed and arrived super-fast. However, there are a lot of pennings inside and there were even insect cocoons on the pages..."
2,Sad...,"It's terrible that a book like this ever came into exisitence. This tragedy of writing caused thousands of deaths of inoccent people, all of which was done under an inccorect interpretation of the Bible. The ""Witch"" in this book is taken from the Old Testament Code of Moses that said ""Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."" Unfortunately, the translation is improper, like most of the Bible, and sould read ""a person who casts hexes or charms to harm another person"" instead of ""witch"". People in league with the devil are refered to as Satanists not witches. This is a sad example of the power that the Catholic Church once held...thankfully that power is beginning to diminsh."
2,Not what it seems,"The place of this book in history has been greatly distorted. The book is real enough, but it was also condemned by the Inquisition in 1490 just 3 years after Sprenger and Kramer first published it. It was not in fact the Church's witch-hunting manual. The book was, however, picked up and used by secular authorities decades later in the so-called Burning Time (1550-1650). Anyone interested in this book or subject should read historian Jenny Gibbons' discussion available (as is Malleus Maleficarum) on the Internet."
3,"A book for an experienced historian, not laymen","The Malleus is a significant work full of meaning to those who have the background to appreciate it. Without the background, it becomes a source for a lot of misinformation, especially dangerous to those who are hung up on the subject of witches. Informed readers who know how to separate out and distinguish fact from fiction will find the Introductions by Rev. Summers fascinating, but misleading. Witchcraft is a fantasy which the Church converted to its use as it began to lose membeship. It is not the world wide conspiracy of evil described. Because of the Malleus, millions of persons were killed over a period of three hundred years. Again, this is a work for historians and experienced readers."
1,not good on Kindle,This may be a great book in hard/paperback but it is too difficult to navigate in the Kindle format. Do not buy it!
1,Not worth the download,"Perhaps on paper this would be interesting to flip through for inspiration or amusement, but on Kindle it's just cumbersome and not useful.The book is as the title indicates: a straightforward list of phrases. However, unless you know what you are looking for and how the author would have started the phrase (""We again thank you for your inquiry"" rather than ""Thank you for your inquiry""), finding specific help is difficult (I also searched for the aforementioned sample phrase - which came straight from the book - and came up with no results).It's is not completely useless, but I cannot see how I would ever find anything I needed in any reasonable amount of time."
3,Good Book,"This book is full of all the facts and details that you receive from the other Canterbury Tales books you get. It is a very good book, and needs to be recommended to people of all ages."
5,A hunters dream,"This stuff is awesome. Heals blisters, keep my knuckles from cracking and waterproofs my boots. I finally bought a new one after forgetting to take my old tin to camp this year. That is a mistake I will not make again. Amazon ships fast and sells at a good price. My wifle likes to use this on her chapped lips and on razor burn.FANTASTIC PRODUCT"
5,real RN's use Bag Balm,"As an R.N. that has to wash my hands multiple times a shift and wear medical gloves that cause severe dry skin I have tried just about every skin cream available including all the ones you see on TV that ""nurses"" supposedly use, and I can tell you that Bag Balm is THE BEST one I have ever used and the only one that heals my hands when they get severely cracked and sore. It can be a bit greasy and doesn't have a nice fake perfume smell, but it works, period. Many of the nurses I work with also use it on a regular basis."
5,No more dry feet.,"This ointment is saving me money on pedicures, my feet are baby soft. Also, it is great for super dry winter skin. My mom has been using it for Decades! Not sure how well it works for cows but for me it is the BALM!!!! Be careful you don't order the 1 oz as it looks the same in the photo and cost about the same, 10 oz is the way to go!"
4,very good product for cyclists,"I am a cyclist who puts on about 1,000 miles per year. I read about this product for curing saddle sores. I was skeptical, but it does work. I use it during the ride and after. It creates healing relatively quickly too. The only downside of this product is that it is not greaseless (that is the only reason I did not give it a 5). But when you have saddle sores and chafing, you want something that works. I have tried Vaseline and other cycling lubricants. It has healed me to the point where I do not need anything for my shorter rides. I recommend this solution. Since you do not need much for treatment the 10oz. goes a long way. If you are skeptical, try the small ounce offerings."
5,Use it for dogs hot spots,"Use this for my dogs hot spots. A short-haired American Staffy. He gets hot spots due to his short hair on his stomach area from being outside. Chews at them all the time. I used this on them and his spots cleared up in a few weeks. The vets didn't know what to give me other then expensive ointments or pills to knock him out. I said screw them and spoke to a family friend of mine. She referred me to ""pulvex"". Gave me a little bit and it worked. Come to find out they don't make it anymore and this is the replacement for it I guess. Same ingredients as the pulvex. My dog actually likes it I think. He rolls over now when I get it out."
4,Best Healing Salve Out There,"A previous reviewer ""the surgeon"" was dead-on. Bag Balm does speed up the healing of cracked skin. I have a condition which makes my skin crack and split. I have been using Nordic Care foot cream, which is very good and not as greasy, but it doesn't create the healing effect that Bag Balm does. Having said that, there are two drawbacks. First, it stinks. It's not super-offensive, but it's not a pleasant smell. I guess it's the lanolin. Secondly, it takes a good 30 minutes for a small amount to soak in enough before you can touch anything. You either need gloves or a spell of downtime to effectively apply an ample amount of this stuff. A 10 oz can will last a LONG time for one person."
3,cold weather cracked fingers and heels,It seems to be as good as anything else we tried - maybe a bit better - though it also appears to be somewhatt on the expensive side
1,BAG BALM Dangerous to Humans,"Just a note of caution, Bag Balm contains 8-Hydroxyquinoline sulfate which is toxic to humans. Please do a web search and you'll find lots of information about it.a great one to check is http://www.pesticideinfo.orgToxicity to humans, including carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, and acute toxicity."
1,Bad Customer Service,Hi: I purchased a product from this company I purchased a bottle of powder and when I received and open the bottle was NOT sealed and the powder was all over inside the envelope notify them by e-mail explaining the problem they keep asking for pictures.
5,"Stinks, but lots of great uses!","Dry patches, hang nails, blisters, minor burns (cooled), and the BEST use: under your nose while you have a cold! Mine gets so raw from all the tissues, this fixes it immediately and my nose is already stuffed so I don't have to smell it!"
4,Excellent product,I have used this product for all kinds of skin problems in my pets. It really helps healing and is hard to lick off.
4,"Works well, but beware of the smell","This product works like a charm. If you suffer from dry skin, particularly in the winter, or during windy days, this product will offer instant relief. Its only drawback -- it doesn't smell particularly well."
4,Cracked feet remedy,"I was referred to this product by my pedicurist. Though I did not know that this product was product was for cows, it appears to be very helpful and keeping my extremely dry feet/heels moisturized, especially if it is applied at least once, twice per day."
3,I wish I could say I loved this stuff.,"My family has used this product for many years and it has worked well for them. I, on the other hand, cannot use Bag Balm. I think it is due to my Sulfa allergy. I may be wrong, but it is important that people be aware of anything they are using, especially when it is not the initial intended usage. I tried it on my feet and my skin began to get red, itchy, blister, and peel. I had a little redness on my hands, as well, but I had wiped it off and washed my hands after applying it to my feet. Anyway, I noticed someone giving a warning about 8-Hydroxyquinoline sulfate and I wanted to share my experience. I know Bag Balm worked well for my family, so just be aware that it isn't for everyone. I realize very few people have a Sulfa allergy, so this product will probably work great for the majority of the people like it did for my family."
4,Bag Balm,"I purchased Bag Balm for the first time about a month ago for use on severely dry skin, primarily on my elbows, feet, and hands. It works very well and my skin feels much better. Prior to this, I had tried many different moisturizers (none of which worked as well). I have very sensitive skin and I didn't have a bad reaction to the product. My only negative about the Bag Balm is that it leaves a greasy film on your skin after application."
5,Great for breastfeeding,"This stuff is great for breastfeeding moms as well as for those who are using a breast pump. The balm is soothing and makes sore nipples less painful while nursing or pumping. Doesn't interfere with milk, doesn't seem to bother the kid while he's nursing. Does make a big of a goopy mess on clothes, so beware."
2,Kyle,Packaged on it's side and leaked everyone on all items shipped. half the can was all over the inside of the box
1,Melts in shipping,"Bought the product before in store. But DON'T buy it online. Product was a vat of thick goo upon arrival. Stained everything else in the package. Useless. Threw everything away. Hey, if it's summer, definitely don't buy on line. If you live in the South or Southwest, NEVER buy this online."
3,1 Ounce for 5.48???,1 ounce for 5.48 is a rip-off. The picture of the tin is deceiving. I didn't realize the oz difference and ended up paying 5.48 for one ounce rather than $1 for 10 ounces.
4,product ok,"product is ok ordered 4 because one said an ointment, when I received them they were all the same Company said it is how some sites advertise their product"
5,No More Cracked Labrador Paws,"The other Amazon reviewers were correct. Before bedtime, just put the Bag Balm on the paw pads of your dog and then cover the paws with dog socks. The socks keep the Bag Balm on the paws and off your floor/furniture, it also prevents them from licking their paws. After just two applications my lab's cracked paws were healed, and he stopped licking his paws on his own. Would highly recommend this for other dog owners."
3,my doctor recommended it for dry skin,"he also said to wear it with a glove over it which i don't, so i may not glob it on thick enough. it's effective if i were to use it regularly. not sure it's that much more effective than other things out there. it doesn't perform immediate miracles, but when i use it a few days in a row, i do notice a difference"
4,A must have,This book was required reading for a seminar and I found it very beneficial in understanding the strained relationship between two groups with conflicting goals: the media and elected officials.I especially enjoyed his analysis on reporters making news with their interpretation of the facts.I'm very excited to add that I will be meeting Tom Patterson and hope he will expand upon his books results as they relate to our current political situation. I welcome any questions you would like me to submit.
2,"A few good ideas, but dull and uninspired.","Although Patterson's conclusion ""How to Fix the Campaign:Shorten It"" has various worthwile ideas, the rest of Out of Order is summarized research and quotes from other individuals. The most interesting facts and quotes from this book are not Patterson's, but another individuals. It also is poorly organized, and has an amateurish feel to it."
5,Great high quality bucket,This bucket is strong because it is made of thick plastic. It also has measurement marks inside to indicate the filled volume (1-6 gal).
4,Can't beat a home-grown/Ohio-made flick!,"Like my title says, you can't beat an Ohio made movie! Supporting the Buckeye State just got a bit easier... knowing it was made here with local actors is two thumbs up in my book! Plus, I'm amazed at what they were able to accomplish for the cost of the film.I was more frightened by B-Horror movies growing up than any of the blockbusters that Hollywood produced. B-Horror movies are as much a cultural icon of America as apple pie."
1,THE HORRORS OF THIS MOVIE (watching it that is),"Don't be fooled by the other reviews of this film posted here. This movie is just plain TERRIBLE! Super boring. Stupid script. Lot's of terrible stuff in this one. The very sparcely used CG war effects are decent but you can see better on the History channel for free. The dvd cover art is very misleading as well. This is a VERY small story, not the horror epic the cover art conveys. AVOID!"
3,FAUX PAS EMBULAS,"I was attracked to the cover & subject matter of this flic. After I received it I put it on the shelf in plain veiw and stared at it for a few weeks. Then I played it and.... (besides the nice retro credits...very cool) it had a (made in the back yard with moms old video camera look to it) style not all it's own. But I soldiered on figuring it's probably gonna be a piece of work.Still... puttong all the ""B"" qualities aside, it was a rather enjoyable ""B"" flic. They did the best with whatever sourses they had and the plot was far from unenjoyable. I don't give away plots. I believe movie trailers have pros & cons and being tricked many times before by awesome trailers for dud flics, well, if you can keep your emotions out of it you can use trailers to some advantage. (LEGION was my latest trailer blunder-what crap) So with 5 STAR being unbelievably awesome-4 STAR being great 3 STAR is pretty good 4 STAR is just not worth it & 5 is trash."
4,Not your average WW2 flick,"Totally produced in Ohio. Peter John Ross gives you mad German doctors, tough American GI's, throw in some super-solidiers with plenty of action and you've got yourself a very watchable film."
3,native stories,I was hoping for more information and a more complete compilation of stories. It's rather short and most of the stories can be found elsewhere.
1,Not very good,"I ordered a Southwestern Bell ID450. I was sent an FF915TE, which I guess is the same thing. However, I was never able to get the phone to work. I called tehir help center 6 times and followed all directions. FInally they told me to go to a Radio Shack and have the battery checked. Radio Shack said they were unable to check the battery. I am returning the phone, and I advise people to STEER CLEAR OF THIS PRODUCT."
1,THE WORST PHONE I'VE EVER OWNED,"After having left my old cordless out in the rain, I (obviously) needed a new phone. I went to the local department store and bought this phone. We had problems from DAY 1! At first, I didn't realize it was related to the phone, which is why I never returned it. Like the others, I got feedback, the phone sometimes would just shut off with no apparent reason, and anytime I wanted to use my dial-up Internet connection, I had to disconnect this phone, because it would interfere with my connection. After owning this phone less than a year, I'm having to buy a new one - my last one lasted over ten years, and probably would have lasted longer if I hadn't left it out in the rain!"
3,Vinyl-look CD-R but not black CD-R!,"Buyers looking for black CD-Rs should read more carefully the description. I brought this pack but found that it's not really black CD-R. If the recording side is the ordinary silver color, I don't have to spend this much for a pack of only 50s!Verbatim should make real black CD-Rs on the recording side."
1,Makes Great Coasters!,"Great if you like to have coasters that look like old 45's :(No joke. I love the look, but I'm not into wasting time and money, and I used both a Plextor Burner and a Lite-On, (both are fast dual core pc's), so it's not my hardware.Very dissapointed, I'll never buy Verbatim products again."
2,Every other CD is a dud...,"I bought these blank CDs to make some audio mixes with. They look really cool and are much more fun to look at then the usual dull shiny or matted CDs you get. However, looks only go so far. Every other CD I've burned with has been a dud. I have a great TDK Burner, 48X speed, and use the latest version of Nero. Doesn't matter b/c the CD's themselves don't seem to want to work every time. I've only been able to successfully use about 50% of the CDs in this spindle and won't be buying anymore of this line from Verbatim til they fix their quality issues in manufacturing these CDs. My $12 50-pack spindle Target-brand CDs have worked like a charm and I haven't hit a dud with a single one of those yet. In this case you definitely don't get what you pay for."
1,Junk!,"Less than 50% were usable. I like the look of the Vinyl tops, but quality is horrible. Buy if you need some extra coasters."
3,Low rating due to damage in shipping.,"The discs are great; I've used Verbatim for years without any problems.What's not so great is that Amazon throws the spindle pack in a box with an inadequate amount of protective material, then UPS plays football with the box. Result: spindle case destroyed, one disc cracked, 3 more discs scratched."
5,Sometimes Brand Name Does Make a Difference,"Switching to Verbatim blank disks cured my problem of skips and stutters in music files I had converted to CD, making them totally unusable. Now my offloads work every time and I can get my hard drive under control."
4,Verbatim Digital Vinyl CD-R,"Fun version of the CD-R format simulating the looks of a 1960's 45 rpm single recording. Nearly 70 of theseVerbatim 94587 700 MB 52X Digital Vinyl CD-R, 50-Disc SpindleCD-R's burned to date with zero errors/failed discs. The only improvement needed is less manufacturer writing on the ""label"" and more space for the user to write in identifying information."
1,Not happy,"I purchased these about 3 months ago but just opened them to attempt to burn songs onto them. So far from the 1st pack of 50, 33 wouldnt allow me to burn songs. Im hoping that I have better luck with the 2nd bunch"
5,So cute....,"...welcome back to when you used to play your 45 records on your own stereo. You could even stack then in the sequence you would like to heard that and you could have music for almost an hour without fiddling with your stereo.These discs look just like those. Nostalgia, for the win!"
2,Bad quality,I don't typically write reviews but 50% did not work. They look cool but quality sucks. Those that worked had scratches throughout the songs. Even my very cheap blank CDs had better quality. 1 star for looking cool though.
2,Looks cool but low success rate,"The only saving grace for these is their appearance. They do look very cool.We ordered about 400 of these to give to our wedding guests. What a pain! Even burning at 4x, about 1 in 10 of would still fail data verification. The first tracks on these failed CDs would be fine but the last few songs would be dead air. After doing about 50 (which took forever), we decided to just get some plain silver CD-Rs that would burn reliably at 52x.The amount of time it takes to burn just one of these and the fact that it STILL makes the occasional coaster are two good reasons to consider something more reliable (and cheaper). However, if you are looking for a unique looking CD-R and have time and money to waste, then try these out."
4,The retro-cute factor here is irrestible,"People still double take when you hand them one of these. They're perfect for band demos and the like. My last set had a deep nick in the top of every one of the discs, but they still look great."
5,Colorful Favors,We created three 'mixes' and used these colorful cds as favors at our wedding. They look like mini albums. This was the best price I could find for this quantity.
5,WHEN ARE THEY GOIN PUBLIC????,"I HAVE BOUGHT THIS MUSIC, AND IT IS GREAT. I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT IF I GO OUT AND BUY THIS WOULD I LIKE IT . WELL... I DO. I DON'T MIND MY CHILD LISTENING TO THIS. I'VE HEARD THE LYRICS AND HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY KNOW THEM. AND IT'S ALL GOOD."
1,Shocked,"I purchased two of these Cd Player alarm clocks for my boys. What a piece of JUNK! They both would never keep the time, both started flashing, and then one of them just stopped working all together....with the battery in. I returned both to the store. I am searching for other brands, though I do like my portable Coby cd player and it is working great after two years, but these CD Player alarm clocks were not worth the money nor the time. Now I have two boys who are disappointed. I will probably have to get alarm clocks and cd players separate. Really did not want to do that. BUT DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. THERE ARE TOO MANY GLITCHES."
2,not as described,We purchased this radio only because of the headphone jack. The box lists one but it does not have one. Was shipped with a label on the box--damage making it impossible to gift wrap. Seller must not have checked out the product before selling it.
1,Loses time and 5-minute snooze,"For a small stereo / cd-player, this device is fine. As an alarm clock, it's downright awful. Using a CD with the alarm function would have been great if it didn't only play the first song on a CD - even the most basic disc-man has a memory function, so why can't this clock? Also, the snooze was for 5 minute interval - as a lifelong and hardcore snooze-button user, this was just obnoxious. I need the standard 9-minute snooze, but learned that fact the hard way. The worst thing about this clock, though, is that it couldn't even keep correct time! Mine would lose over a minute a day, so that by the end of the week it was 10 minutes behind my other clocks. Don't bother with this one - either pay a little more for something a little better, or use your cell phone (like I've had to resort to)."
4,"its an great radio, alarm not as much!","for the price you can't beat it, but you can't put the radio on sleep and then have the buzzer go off in the morning. and if you are a heavy sleeper like me the radio simply won't do. i would have love to know this before i bought. great radio but if your getting it for the alarm just note my previous comment. fast shipping, great seller."
3,ok but the tuner could be better,"This unit is ok but it could use a digital tuner with some pre-sets instead of the old dial type. antenna is a little wimpy, too. The cd player needs to be treated with care when closing the top, other than that it seems to work ok. We will see how well it hold up with future use.This was purchased mainly because of the dual voltage switch, as it will be used world wide."
2,Not worth the price.,"Controls are difficult to manage, particularly setting the times for each alarm. (My building loses electricity pretty frequently which means resetting the clocks and it's a pain with the way the buttons are set up.) The cd does not work (not long after I bought the radio). The sound is terrible.You are getting what you pay for: not much."
2,No headphone jack,"I've been looking for an inexpensive cd clock radio with a headphone jack and thought I had found one. I was very disappointed when I opened the box and could not find the headphone jack anywhere. There was no headphone jack shown on the owner's manual included in the box. The box stated a headphone jack but there is no jack on this unit. I returned this to Amazon and ordered the Phillips AJ3950. If you're looking for a cd clock radio to use headphones with, I wouldn't purchase this Coby model. I liked the design but without a headphone jack I cannot use it."
1,Disappointed,"Well the radio worked fine, and the clock seemed to work. The Cd player would not work at all. Yea I set the alarm to wake up to a cd and the alarm turned the radio on but the cd never played. And no it wasn't a burned cd. It was an original."
1,Unuseable,"This is a terrible product. The clock runs fast -- it gains a minute every few days. The CD player skips at the slightest vibration, from when I walk across my room to when someone opens the door to my building 4 floors below. Frequently, I wake up to a noise like a fan with something stuck in the blades rather than my CD.Anyone who is looking for a reliable clock or CD player would do better to spend a few extra dollars to buy something that actually works."
1,bad item,This clock radio lost 3 -4 4 minutes daily so I sent it back to the company I bought it from.....Photoland NY...for a replacement after I got no response at all from the Coby company. The second clock arrived and had the same issues....losing time on a daily basis once again. I tried contacting the Coby Co. to use the warranty but once again got absolutely no respnse so I contacted Photoland NY and they said to return it and they would refund the cost plus the shipping I paid to return both units. This ia an absolute piece of junk! Useless if you need it to use as an alarm clock but the CD player and radio seemed to work Ok for the short time I had it. I don't recommend this item at all but would like to recommend Photoland NY for their gret customer service and for standing by their merchandise. The Colby Co. gets an F in all aspects of customer relations in my book.......
1,"Peice of junk, returned mine, dont waste you money and time..",We had this for a little over a week. Nothing but problems. Time would not set properly. Only played CD when it wanted to. Was a real piece of junk.
1,false information about product,"I ordered this because it wanted the earphone jack as stated in the product description. When I received the product, no earphone jack as stated on the box. I called the company and was told they have been aware of the problem and have not really done anything about it. Sorry for the inconvenience try sending it back. What a rip off. When a company does not stand behind its product."
2,Likely will need glued,Description allows you to search the model of your car to make sure it fits. It does not explain very well that 'fitting' means it can be glued to the windshield. This is disappointing if you're looking for something that will replace your original mirror.
2,mirror,This item gives the review for it self and you get what you pay for. It was cheap and the item was also. very wobbley.
5,Sub cable,Very good quality cable. It feeds a my sub without any hum so shielding must be good for its length.
4,Shazen - excellent fun,"Though probably a little two long, at over 2 hours, for such a simple story this samurai ""comedy"" was excellent fun to watch and quite moving in parts. This is a 2004 remake of a movie originally filmed in black and white in 1935 as ""The Million Ryo Pot"". The cinematography is wonderful. Highly recommended for some very campy acting by Etsushi Toyokama and good sword fights."
3,"Plot line good, but contained offensive material","The plotline of this book was very enjoyable, and would infact, rate higher on my list if not for one detail. There is a rapescene in this book that's kind of graphic and it really wasn't necessary for it to be there. I was very much enjoying the book until that portion. All in all, the author lowered the value of this book by putting it there."
2,She tried hard,"This book had a lot of potential. It was unsual in that villains were the protagonists. However, for this sort of thing to succeed, the villains must be both bad and sympathetic. Unfortunately, Forward succeeded only in the latter. I was expecting the main characters to break out into song about getting along at several points in the novel. The good guys (antagonists in the book) are more evil than the villains! The premise is good, that too much good destroys the world's balance and threatens to destroy everyone. However, the book does not live up to expectations."
5,This is one of the best books I have ever read,"I have not read any other books by Forward, but after I read this book, I am going to try to read all of her other work."
3,"Entertaining and worth reading, not brilliant","Villians by Necessity is a fun and amusing book about the bad guys trying to set the world right again, after the triumph of goodness and light. A definite parody of the ""heroic fantasy"", the book is fun and an enjoyable read. The plot is standard (anti)-heroic quest fare, and the characters are more cariacature-like than full-drawn personalities: Valerie is just nasty, Robin faints at everything, etc. Sam is the one exception, and thus the most likeable character in the book, in my opinion. He is the one who really blurs the lines between what is good and what is evil. Fun, but with its share of flaws (some of the comic bits are a bit over-done) and inconsistancies. For people who enjoyed the premise of this book, I'd recommend Louise Cooper's Time Master Trilogy: The Initiate, The Outcast, and The Master--a more serious look at the same concept. All in all, a worthwhile read, but expect fun, not brilliance."
3,mean girls in Canada,Britt and Alexia Fast are such a teen in this and so are the rest of the girls. If only there had been more for Richard Harmon to do. Still its one of those sleepover LIFETIME movies. Its great to get the real version of it on DVD instead of the TV version.
2,Confusing and Stupid,"Maybe it's just me, but I was confused in the beginning of the movie on what happened with the girls before the sleepover. It took me like 40 minutes into the movie to understand what fights and hate was about between the girls. Then second thing is, the stupid part is why is it someone who just moved into town wants to start digging up a past that doesn't have anything to do with them or even have any affect on their future what so ever. It's not important let the past be the past. And lastly, I think the characters contradict their personalities. Like for example one time some are shy, quiet and reserved and the next they're loud and buck-wild. I thought it was alright but I think it could've been better in so many ways."
4,A classic volume,"Putnam's classic book provides a superb presentation of multiple personality disorder as it was conceptualized and treated through the 70s and 80s, prior to the re-characterization of Dissociative Identify Disorder (DID). Etiologically the model assumes traumatic abuse in childhood (as opposed to other traumatic phenomena later in life)and as described treatment includes a structured elicitation of the ""alternates""--an approach not now typically used in the treatment of DID. The volume provides both theoretical and case based treatment examples from one of the major thinkers in this area."
5,They call this the Bible of treating MPD,"Read it, you will know why. Putnam adresses a great deal of issues that a therapist may encounter, and truly gives both the Therapist and the paitent hope."
4,This EP grows on you,"""Betterman"" is unfortunately not a Pearl Jam cover, but the Beatles' ""Across the Universe"" is -- like every other single cover -- truly amazing."
3,"Slim on content, not an expert tour.","Although this book gives some useful insights on compiling other languages into JVM bytecode, it doesn't present any revolutionary concepts. It is not an expert or comprehensive reference by any means and wastes way too many pages on explaining the syntax of the oolong language rather than the workings of the JVM itself. For instance the bytecodes generated and the behaviour of the 'finally' clause in isolation is explained, but not in conjuction with exceptions which it is most commonly used. Unfortunately, like so many other Java references, it resorts to wasting pages on printing Java APIs (in particular the security APIs) when Javadoc in html form is so much more efficient to read.Having said that, the section on verification is interesting and the book itself does spark the imagination of what is possible (and what is not) with JVM bytecode."
3,Wire loosens.,"I was disappointed in this product. The wire just won't remain tight... The slices get bigger and bigger, regardless of adjustment."
1,Item shipped with a loose wire and does not retain its adjustment,"Came with a loose wire. I tried to tighten the wire, with no luck. My husband also tried to tighten the wire and was unsuccessful. The screw used to adjust the width of a cheese slice does not stay tight. I would not recommend this item."
1,I used it once and the wire stretched out and now it's useless.,I used it once and the wire stretched out and now it is useless. I would not buy this again.
4,Boker bone handle knives,"These are exceptional knives for the price available here! The steel sharpens easily. The stag handle is really easy to grip.On this model, the sheath does lack a tight friction fit or containment loop. Not good for a belt, better for a tacklebox or kitchen. Other Boker hunting types have an excellent sheath that will grip and protect the entire blade and most of the handle in rugged conditions (hiking, hunting etc.)5 stars if the sheath were more than just a ""blade cover"" on this model."
3,Vinyl stinks,"This is a great looking statue that smells horrible if it gets warm. I bought this statue and had to get rid of it just a few weeks after purchase. When it originally came to the house, it smelled just like hot rubber usually smells. But I figured the smell was only due to the fact that it had been sitting in the back of a hot delivery truck all day and it would eventually go away. Well, it didn't. Every day I would come home to my apartment smelling like hot vinyl. The smell was so strong, I'd have to open my windows to try and air it out and it would give me pounding headaches.It's too bad this wasn't a cold cast porcelain statue, because it's really great looking. But the choice of vinyl just really kills this unless you're planning on storing it in a freezer."
5,An important reference for shell structure mechanics,"This book clearly explains shell structure mechanics from a mathematical and practical perspective. As a practicing engineer and finite element user, I found it extremely useful and easy to understand. This is also an invaluable reference for graduate students in applied mechanics. I think it will be a classic reference in that field."
1,Useless for most people,The book is probably good for researchers. It is however not suitable for beginners or practitioners.
5,A wish-fulfilling gem,I recently purchased my second copy of this book. The Jnaneshwari is an amazing window into the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita. A hallmark of this work is the beauty of the language Jnaneshwar Maharaj uses to unpack and explain the many subtleties in the Bhagavad Gita's verses. I've read many translations of this work and Swami Kripananda's approach is by far the most heart-felt and inspiring.
3,more depressing than useful,"Caplan's book focuses on what a terrible place the academy is for women, without giving adequate attention to ways students and faculty members can avoid or solve problems. It's a pessimistic choice, so read it with caution. If you feel discouraged, this book might help you realize that you are not alone in facing patterned discrimination, but if you haven't had problems, it might make you want to give up before you have reached your goals."
3,"Time for real change, and democrats not ""Democrats""","American Politics will progress when it gets beyond the two party system. In international terms both parties are fairly similar in political orientation. In the ""South"", the Democrats are right wingers, and in the ""North"" left wingers...The emergence of a decent third party is the way forward, and whoever does so will capture the Democratic majority talked about here, as well as the alienated people who would vote for neither of the twin parties."
5,Great book,"When I read this in 2007 I thought that the thesis of the book was fallacious, especially since it was written and released before the Kerry/ Bush election in 2004 and Kerry lost. However, I judged the authors much to quickly. Their predictions that places like North Carolina and Virginia would turn blue due to increases in education and technology ended up coming true in 2008. Boy, did they it the nail on the head! This was the latest they predicted it would happen (2008). Great book and highly recommended!"
3,Bosch 97152 Water Pump ???????????,Ordered this item and when it arrived it was not a bosch 97152 water pump. The box it was shipped in had the bosch label but the water pump itself was not the bosch brand. The water pump did however fit my automobile.
5,Haiku Mind,"I have been communicating with Clark for the past month and have decided to ask him to be my teacher. So you understand, I have been writing Haiku for about 30 years and have read all of the classical haiku. Clark suggested his book to me. I had never encountered it before. I very much wish I was aware of the book when it first came out. This was about 13 years ago and it is still relevant. I have read the other reviews, both good and bad, and do not really agree with any of them. Clark suggests that haiku are a spiritual tool and he is right. He does not tell you how to write a haiku. He tells you about the spiritual aspects of haiku writing. There should be no disconnect on any level between myself and the poem on between myself and the event the poem describes. This is haiku mind. Beginners mind in Zen is this same level of connectedness. My hope is that I can always be a beginner and that I can always be engaged."
1,deceiving and not practical,"I love Ilse Crawford sense for decoration, but I must say I was deceived by the book (which unfortunately I bought at the same time as her other edition Sensual Living, which is more or less the same). I found both books too much concerned about phylosophy of living instead of orineting on practical issues for interiors. I must admit I am looking for ideas to bild my new house, and if this is the case, this is not the book. In fact you do not get to see much of any of her projects except some pictures of her own home, more or less the same as those appeared in AD. Sory, but for me it was not worth buying it."
4,Secret of Rage,"Since I was 12 years old, because my father's taste for this group, I began to hear, and I could only have the desire to complete his collection, now is a complete pleasure to have the package and highly recommend it to who like heavy rock and do not hesitate to do so."
3,Fun hedgehogs,The tales of this hedgehog's adventures taught me a great deal about nature. They were fun to read too. I recommend it for older children. Though it is out-of-print perhaps they can be found at the library.
1,The worst explanation of OOP I have ever read...,"I was introduced to object-oriented programming about 15 years ago, in the LISP and Smalltalk versions. Now that I'm learning Director, I was excited to find a book devoted to OOP in Lingo. What an utter disappointment this book has turned out to be...an utterly confusing waste time."
2,Over priced and incomplete.,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I purchased it thinking that I was going to be able to greatly increase my programming skills and understanding of OOP. This book contains very good ideas and will increase your understanding of OOP. Many of the scripts just don't work. Maybe this is due to the fact that the book was apparently written for Director 4 and 5. That is all that I see referenced. It would be great if Mr. Small would update the book because it can have great value. His web site contains some dot syntax examples from the book that actually work.If you purchase the book, you will increase your understanding of lingo and you will increase your frustration level trying to make the scripts work.For the price, it should have a companion cd."
3,Disappointing,"It would have been nice if he had working samples online of the programs to go along with the stuff in the book. While interesting subject, his programming is not the most efficient. Have the time I feel like he is just B.S.ing his way through the book. It is a pain to have to build all your own examples, which means you can't just jump into the chapter you're interested in. Also, the images in the book are blurry, how the heck did the publisher ever let that get by? Haven't they ever seen a clear screen shot."
4,A great instructional video in part,"This video is made up of 7 sections, ranging form Motivation to Pre-game preperation to Post game analysis. 5 of these 7 sections are pretty basic and if you have a bit of basketball knowledge, you'll probably be able to fast forward through it. However, the section on Fast Break offence by Pat Riley and Pressure Defence by Rick Pinto are really amazing. The defence section is high tech defence, really only suitable for high school kids or older which will really find this section useful. The fast break section shows Pat Riley run through the drills that made his Lakers Fast break so potient. I doubt you'll find a better value video on these 2 sections."
2,"Benign, unfortunately.....","This is 1 of the weakest horror novels I've ever managed 2 finish reading (the other was Daniel Gower's THE ORPHEUS PROCESS, also part of Dell's Abyss horror series, home of the brilliant Kathe Koja). Hanner creates some spooky, gruesome atmosphere, with women giving birth 2 malignant tumors, & hints that San Jose, Calif.'s computer industry might B at the root of it all. But she does nothing with it -- nothing ever really happens. There R other problems: The book was poorly proofread, & 1 Air Force Lt. Col. has his full rank completely spelled-out every single time his name appears -- an irritating waste of space if you're in the AF & know ranks -- it coulda been abbreviated after the 1st couple times. Plus Hanner Cms 2 confuse the names of San Jose-area cities (I used 2 live there) -- this also coulda been fixed with better proofreading. I DID finish the book, & there R a few chills, but ... disappointing."
4,A good place to start for a beginner,This is a good DVD for a beginner. Souhail does a good job of teaching the basics of playing the doumbek and riq. This DVD is the only one I have seen so far that shows you exercises to help build flexibility in your hands to aid playing the doumbek. I now know how to clap with one hand :)There are three basic rhythms taught on this DVD as exercises to help you develop your skills.I am a beginner and I have found this DVD very useful. My daughter is a belly dancer in the LA area and she says the drummers who have studied with Souhail are all good drummers.I use this DVD along with the beginning DVDs from Karim Nagi and Amir Naoum. Each instructor teaches the same basic foundation but different exercises. I like the variety and practice different exercises each day.The only reason I gave this DVD 4 stars is the lack of rhythms. Both the Karim Nagi and Amir Naoum DVDs teach more rhythms.
1,Total rip off,"with this purchase, you receive ONE 15-wipe packet. This was total robbery. I don't understand how the list price could ever be $21.48 for ONE packet. Granted, the actual sale price was discounted to $5.19, however these single packets sell for $0.99.Based on the $21.48 list price, I assumed that I was going to receive 15 packets."
2,A very weak read about a potentially enriching experience,"The author is an extremely self-centered and shallow young woman who thinks she is doing the world a favor by going to Episcopal divinity school and writing about the experience. Hey, why does one go to Div school in the first place if you don't like to pray?"
4,no instructions,"A good filter for the price. Works well. Includes everything you need to change the filter, including new O rings. It didn't look as substantial as the OEM one it replaced. I'm going back to OEM."
5,Good filter and cheaper price,"This filter is as good as Toyota OEM filter. in comparison with OEM filter, the dimension is exact the same and actually Fram filter had 2 extra fold in the element which it means it can trap more particle than OEM filter. It come complete with all necessary o-rings and drain adaptor.The price in AMAZON is even few cents cheaper than Wal-Mart."
2,Do not buy it,"Bought this from Amazon. The rubber rings I received were so loose, I could not use them. Instead, I re-used the old rubber rings."
5,It's a calendar,"Sure, some of the cartoons were funny, but I don't think I'll ever buy another calendar even if someday I have another desk job."
4,"Quick Read, But Will Satisfy Fans","The Sitter is a great book by prolific author of horror, R.L. Stine. He is a commercial writer who turns out at least 2 new books each month and writes in an accessible, understandably addictive way. He attracts not only kids to his Goosebumps and Fear Street book series, but even with his novels for adults--like The Sitter--Stine captivates and keeps you guessing until the end.Stine gives us a woman, Ellie, who suddenly finds a job taking care of two interesting children over the summer in the Hamptons. What started out as a fun and exciting escape from the city will, without warning, become a harrowing, terror filled experience. You won't guess the ending!"
4,Not bad for a try at the adult world,"I used to read RL Stine all of the time! I loved his books. Now, at 28, I saw this book at the library and thought, what the heck. So I picked it up, read it in only a few hours, and for the most part enjoyed it.I do admit though that he didn't quite make it at writing for the ""adults"" or even the 20-somethings. He just didn't. However, I still found it a pretty good read, a compelling story. Yes, I was able to guess for the most part what the ending was, but hey, that's fun to do now and again!If you used to read his books, I'd recommend picking it up- it's worth the short time it takes to read this book."
1,Parents-Don't let your kids near this book!,"RL Stine has made a fortune catering to children and young teen readers. He, until this book, was a trusted name to be in the hands of that audience. However, my 11 yr. old son was exposed to outright overly adult words, topics and descriptions about drinking, drugs and full on sexual acts all in just the first chapter. There was nothing on the back of the book summary or anywhere else to give any awareness that this book should be only for mature, adult readers. Shame on RL Stine and his publisher for blindsiding parents and their children for his need to expand his literary prowess in the adult world without any concern for the negative impressions that he has caused in the minds of unsuspecting children and parents who thought he was one of the 'good guys'."
3,"Interesting, but ending didn't hold up.","First of all, I did read to the end so I gave it 3 stars because ""The Sitter"" did keep me there until the end.However, the way the plot unraveled and the book ended left much to be desired. There was no way to guess the ending, which was quite random and bizarre, in my opinion. I was expecting a little more realistic creativity rather than unbelievable ""whatever"" conclusions.The best thing about this book was the setting (The Hamptons) and the main characters (attractive and young). Stine did a great job developing several characters that kept you wondering about their intentions and mysterious backgrounds.A pretty fun thriller-style beach book that remains interesting throughout two-thirds of the book and then plummets to its end feeling like you wasted your time. As long as you keep that in mind, you may not be as disappointed as I was."
2,The earth,"This DVD runs a total of 3 hours and 35 minutes. It has 4 programs in it: Amazing Earth, What Lies Beneath, Earth 2100: Wild weather Ahead, Earth the Sequel. The programs blend together. The photography is very good and there are subtitles in English.Basically the film shows and tells how natural forces affect the earth. It goes back in history to mention meteor hits and Pompeii and how volcanoes are formed and the movements of earthquakes are covered.There is just a smoothness messing. Somehow, it seems as if the ideas and facts are just lumped together; even the programs run together in viewing. The narrator tells how the ocean level is rising and shows islands where the population will have to move by 2009; but nothing is told where the people went or what became of them - and the film has a date of 2012.The program ends abruptly as if their time to show their film ran out. The program could have been so much better than what this shows."
2,Market Wizards it ain't,"This book is billed as a Market Wizards of Day Trading. Well it tries to be but it isn't. It's a fairly shallow knock off.The main problem that is that author is not a day trader himself which while not necessairly a bad thing in itself means that half the time he doesn't know where to focus. That's what makes the Schwager books so good. His book is written for traders by a trader.The second problem is that no strict documentation of trading success was required.The third is that the interview is all rehashed by the author and so you don't get the real dialogue which makes you wonder what's getting lost in the translation.Having said all that, every book has some value so if you have the money go ahead and get it. At the very least you can take a look at some traders and their style. You may glean something.But get Market Wizards or Reminiscences of a Stock Operator if you really want an introduction to trading.This book is a far cry from those."
5,Someone did my research for me!,"I was researching ways that I could expand my investment portfolio, and considered day trading as a vehicle to accomplish this. While browsing at the bookstore, I came across Mark Ingebretsen's book. It saved me months of research and probably lots of money too. This book neatly compiles the stories of individuals who I'm sure I would have never heard of. But, now, I have a bigger picture of what the pitfalls are, and how I can avoid them. Mr. Ingebretsen definitely has a talent for extracting details! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the stock market."
5,Learn from others' mistakes,"Dear Mark,I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed your book. Of course I am trying to make a living as a daytrader, but what I find interesting is that your book has the mistakes the various traders have made as well as their successstories. It is very inspirational to know that other people have setbacks too. I am living in Japan; I teach in the evenings then come home and trade from 11:30pm (Japan time) through to early morning, then sleep, then new day begins.......so I am a ""night-trader""......... Anyway I just wanted to say I read and appreciated your book very much! Write another!"
3,not what i expected,I was surprised by the content - lots of stories - expected more details on their actual methods
1,The Worst trading book i've ever read,"I am a full time equity & futures trader. I have read a lot of trading books. The Guts and Glory of Day Trading, has NOTHING to do with day trading. It's just story telling. No *exact* programming code revealed, no statistical analysis either. Overall, it tells you nothing at all about day trading."
4,A sweet film starring the Duffs.,"Even in the coldest places on Earth the magic of Christmas can warm the heart. Join penguin princesses Crystal (voice of Hilary Duff) and Lucinda (voice of Haylie Duff) on the adventure of a lifetime in this enchanting, fun-filled, CGI-animated movie. When a sleigh bell mysteriously falls from the sky, pure-hearted Princess Crystal is determined to prove it came from one of Santa's reindeer. Together, she and her sister, Princess Lucinda, set off on a daring journey to the North Pole to find Santa Claus. Along the way, the royal duo must work together to outrun hungry, wild beasts, outwit greedy pirates, and try to keep three sneaky court penguins from stealing their parents' throne. Featuring delightful characters, great new songs, and a heartwarming story, IN SEARCH OF SANTA celebrates friendship, family, and the most wonderful time of the year.A beautiful story suitable for families, especially young children."
4,So Cute!!!,"I came across this movie as I was searching for Christmas movies. The price was right, so I purchased it. I am glad I did. It is such a cute movie. I like cute movies."
5,Don't Shoot It's Just Me Thug Queen...,"I LOVE Ghetto Cowboy!!! Especially Thug Queen cause everyone says I sing like her!! Ghetto Cowboy has the BEST artists like Krazy Bone, lazy Bone, Powder, Felicia and THUG QUEEN!!! It's got a great beat, and cool lyrics!!! So ya better count your moey so you can go out and BUY it!!!!"
4,Duane Eddy CD,"Lot's of his best. It gets played very often, along with some others and many more other artists. Buy this one."
5,The Battle Begins,"This is an excellent beggining to the Goku vs. Freezer fight. In episode 73, ""Clash of the Super Powers"", Goku uses his Kamehameha attack underwater because Freezer cannot see where he is. Then, Freezer tries some more attacks on Goku, but Goku avoids them so the two decide to start fighting for real.In episode 74, ""Frieza's Boast"" , Freezer declares that he'll fight Goku without using his hands. Elsewhere, Captain Ginyu finds a way to switch bodies with Bulma.In episode 75, ""Bold and Fearless"" Frezzer powers up to 50 percent of his powers and really starts to beat Goku. Goku tries to use the Kaioken but it is rendered useless.This is a great video. The music is now being done very well asa are the voices.There are some real good one liners from Goku in this one such as when Freezaer asks Goku if he wants to fight on land or in the air, Goku says ""Grounds good. Sure why not? I'm a ground kinda guy"" Otherwise the diolouge is done very well. Five Stars"
3,ok,"predictable, but I read it anyways. I dont know that I would waste the time of re-reading this book as I do with many of my others"
4,Wanton Angel,I recently began reading Ms. Miller's older novels. I've enjoyed them all. Wanton Angel kept me entertained the entire way through.
5,Audiophiles invited,"This company's crossovers are amazing. They're cheap, as audibly transparent as one could hope for (at any price) and they do what they're supposed to.I can't believe any active device will sound as good and will likely cost 10-100 times the price. (my audio sistem is a Benchmark DAC1 HDR, Conrad Johnson MF2500A, Dynaudio speakers and a Hsu VTF3-Mk3 sub... yes, I can hear the difference)Highly recommended."
5,Best of the Catholic Bible and Commentary,"The Navarre Bible is the best of Catholic Bibles with commentary. It includes superior scholarship and excerpts from the Catechism. The commentary builds faith and is very fair, not slanted but precise, in most cases, as to what the scripture really says while making the meaning more applicable to one's life."
3,Works fine,"This isn't as attractive as the clear plastic breeder/ dilivery bpxes, but it suits the purpase. Bigger then I thought it would be; my bad should have mesured first."
3,Very hot shoes,"These shoes are quality and well built, the downfall is they are no vent holes so they are hot and your feet sweat. They are somewhat water proof for the most part. The laces come untied all the time as well. Look good and feel good. I think next time I am gonna try the Thorogood station boots. I have always had rocky paratrooper boots and loved them"
2,"Very, very noisy","Fan moves a lot of air and solves the heating/cooling problem we've had, but it's loud enough to keep me from sleeping and can be heard through the entire house. Thinking about taking it out."
2,Wouldn't work for me,"Tried this to boost the flow of ac in a 15' duct, it had no effect and I could not sense any increase in air flow. Besides it was noisy. The only difference to me between this and one half the price from a home store is the wiring box attached to this unit, something you might have to have to meet code wiring requirements.The air flow problem to my warm room was solved with a window ac, don't look for miracle cures.Mine came from Patriot Supply and was returned without problem."
4,I knew Margaret,"I worked with Margaret at a psychiatric hospital in San Diego and use to think she had it all...intelligent, beautiful and kind. I remember how happy she was at getting married. I was interviewed by the FBI as part of a background check prior to her getting the prison job. Never in my wildest imagination would I have ever thought this could have happened to her. She knew all about domestic violence and worked with DV victims. How sad she never saw it coming. To have his defense team portray her as addicted loose woman is a terrible injustice. Shame on the alleged psychiatric experts who bought his story of being provoked into this act."
1,WRONG MANGA,This is the WRONG MANGA.The 6th volume of the REAL Bride of the Water God is being released Aug. 31 of 2010.FIX THIS AMAZON!!!!
1,Very Very disapointed,I was trying to get a completely different book and kept being sent this book instead. After recieving it twice I read it..Horrible graphics and lame story.
1,At Least Expected it Would Work,"Tried booting it up twice on Windows XP, crashed each time. Would have expected this ""Masterpiece Edition"" to have been more efficient. Will try it again at some point (only because I'm stuck with it now), but I wouldn't recommend this to other XP users."
5,Mellow Mood,"Gini Wilson, the Duchess, is a classically trained pianist. Kick back and immerse yourself in jazz undergirded by Gini's solid musical expertise, illumined by her singular talent. You are in for a real treat. This is aptly named ChamberJazz."
2,dino note books,Small notebooks just the right size for a child to slip into pocket or purse. Fairly durable with wire top closure. Fair amount of pages to write on. Good for moms to put in purse for small child to doodle on in church or at a meeting.
4,Great Detail on Muslim Terror Networks: For the Adanced Reader,"This is a very detailed book on the rise and make up of Muslim terrorism that covers the subject very well and challenges the stereotype of what type of person makes up a terrorist. Through detailed analysis of known terrorists utilizing charts and graphs, the author clearly indicates that the assumed sterotype of a terrorist is not valid. However, they are virtually clannish making it very hard to penetrate. The author also covers how the various movements particularly from Egypt and Al Qaeda merged and expanded globally. The book is compact but is relatively technical and the detail and complexity of the organizations may require one with less familiarity to take notes to refer to as you go along in regards to names and organizations. This book is for an advanced reader who is very familar with the topic."
4,Social Networks of Terror,"Social Networks of TerrorMarc Sageman's book ""Understanding Terror Networks"" argues that successfully confronting terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda requires uncovering the web of interconnections that link its members. Using social network analysis, he depicts the strong ties among ""cliques"" of young Muslims who encourage one another to wage jihad and the ""strength of the weaker ties,"" or the loose links with other cadres that link them to Al Qaeda. Sageman argues that social bonds trump either grievance or ideological explanations for the motivations to join terrorist organizations."
3,Informative but extremely dry,"This book is not really about terror networks...this book is about radical Islamic terror networks. This really threw me off when I got this book because I was expecting an account of terror networks throughout the world (like PIRA, etc). It was EXTREMELY dry, but I have to say, I learned a lot about Islamic terrorism. It was just the right length (I do not know if I could bear a longer version)."
3,3.5 stars - Not the best of the series,"Unfortunately, this was not much of a mystery. However, it was a wonderful portrayal of the period and politics of that time. The writing is clever, full of literary references and humor. Nick is an engaging protagonist and Shakespeare an interesting secondary character. While not the best mystery in the series, I highly recommend Goodin to those who love Shakespeare and/or English history."
5,Wonderful!!,Very informative on the waterways in GA. This book help me to locate many fishing areas I probably would have never found unless I used a bunch of gas in my boat. Highly recommended to anyone who likes exploring the waterways in GA.
1,Not the book I ordered,This isn't the book I ordered and I feel that it was sent to me intentionally because the book I did want was quite controversial. I've tried to contact Amazon and the seller about returning it to no avail-so I'll keep it but I'm not happy about the mix up at all.
3,disappointed in quality,I was disappointed in the quality of the seat belt shoulder pads. The Sheepskin is not very heavy compared to ones I have bought in the past from Kmart! I would not buy this particular product again.
3,fur piece for car safety belt,"I got this for my wife and it works fairly well. She was complaining that the seat belt bothered her neck. I got the fur piece to see if this would help. It did not work well when she put it in the area of her neck. However, when she moved it down, it helped keep the safety belt from cutting into her neck. It did help alleviate the problem but only after she tried a different position of the fur piece."
4,Very nice product is as advertised,I bot this because I had a porta-cathe put in & the seat belt was on my left shoulder where the cathe was/is and it hurt. This item arrived really fast & is very soft & fits my shoulder belt. That said I was hoping it would stay where it was put but that is not the case. It will travel down if given a chance. I am glad it bot this item and do recommend it as I am short & the shoulder belt would probably injure me in a crash as it hits my neck so this pad is a protector for that area also. The color goes well with the interior of my car. Thanks!
2,sheepskin seat belt,I hoped this would be a bit thicker - it doesn't work on the seatbelt like I thought it would
2,Not Satisfied,"After reading the RAVE reviews I ordered 2 seat belt shoulder pads. I was so disappointed when I received them in the mail, and they didn't match. 2 totally different fabric textures."
2,Too itchy,I was swayed by all the good reviews but I found this pad too warm and itchy. Doesn't shed but the material is just too uncomfortable. I will be trying one of the memory foam pads.
2,Disappointed,"A seat belt cover should be soft. This one wasn't soft at all; in fact, it was rough to the touch. I wouldn't want it anywhere near my neck. I gave it to my dog."
5,Comfort!!!,"This is the best, it keeps the seatbelt from cutting my neck. You don't even notice it on you, it's feels that good."
4,Sheepskin seatbelt,I love it! My seatbelt no longer is cutting into my shoulder. I also bought one for my daughter and she is much happier too!
4,Great for the whole family!,"I bought 3 of these, one for me because I'm short and the strap of the seat belt is always cutting up my neck. The other 2 I bought for my kids in booster seats so they wouldn't put the belt under their arms while driving. A good buy for the price."
1,CHEAP,THIS WAS A VERY CHEAP VERSION. I BOUGHT IT TO REPLACE ONE I HAD TO USE FOR AN EMERGENCY IT WAS VERY STIFF AND NOT SOFT AT ALL ALMOST AS BAD AS THE SEAT BELT
1,"Poor Quality, even for this price","Uneven dying, skewed stitches. Bought 1 pair, different color and red stain on one of them.I know it's cheap, but quality is still poor for this price.Not sure how come there are good reviews. Maybe I got the bad ones."
3,Auto Expressions Sheepskin Seat Belt Shoulder Pad-Grey,Auto Expressions Sheepskin Seat Belt Shoulder Pad-Grey. Smaller and slimmer than I thought. It does not prevent my son's head to fall completely when he sleeps but it helps a little.
3,Butt ugly,Ugly piece of crap. Does not really do the job. After I got this one got a free promotional one from AAA in CA. It looks better and works as well.
2,the seam is very rough,"The seam is sewed together very poorly..... the ""sheep skin"" feels ok.... i had a hard time covering the white seams which made the pad looked cheap...."
2,Terry,These are cheaply made and shed on your clothes. Not much padding for your shoulder. I strongly recommend you forgo these and order the Ergo seat belt shoulder pads.
3,not what I expected,I love the furriness of this but it doesn't fit my seatbelt as it is too wide. Other than that it is a great bargain and I have gotten used to it.
4,Should be sold in sets,"What a surprise to receive just ONE!! It is nice, but should be sold in sets of two. Who ever has just one seatbelt in the front or back?"
5,Nice product,"I purchased these for my son because his seat belt rubs the side of his neck. I've never given seat belt shoulder pads any consideration, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I have been very happy with these. The material is very soft and doesn't shed. The velcro closure is very strong. It stays attached, and I can't even really find the velcro once I close the shoulder pad.The only issue I have, is that I purchased two of these in grey and the colors are slightly different from one another. I also purchased one in a cream color and I think the material that one is made from may not be the same."
5,Sheepskin Seat Belt Shoulder Pad,Excellent product for anyone who has an implanted pacemaker/defibrillator. It's also valuable to anyone who has a problem with the seat belt strap too near their neck. I've bought three so far.
1,Not REAL sheepskin,"Although the item is soft, it balls up because it is synthetic. I'm disappointed it's not the real thing."
3,disappointed,"I ordered 2 of the ""same color"" thinking that is what I would receive...one arrived gray, the other black. These were to be a gift...had to go buy a matching set locally.The unmatched ones I received are nice and soft, but colors do not match, sadly. Service was quick which was appreciated."
2,Low price should have been an indicator of quality,"Poorly constructed . Rough edge along the Velcro that you have to make sure is away from your face, and be careful how you grab the seatbelt because if your hand slips along that rough edge, you will get an abrasion. Should have realized at the low price, the quality would not be there. Not worth paying the return postage on though."
2,This book IS for dummies!,Author took the title too literally. He fills the book with corny analogies and bad jokes. Covers the most basic uses of CorelDraw and nothing more. Buy a more sophisticated title!
3,"It is witty, but needs some improvement","CorelDraw 8 for DummiesIn general the book is fun and easy to read. I used it to learn CorelDraw for the first time. Everything is explained in plain English. The only two things that slightly annoyed me were: emphasizing the use of the rarely-used ""keyboard equivalents"" instead of the mouse and some unnecessary chunks of text with vague explanations that could be easily avoided. The witty descriptions are refreshing for someone, but only for one who is not in a rush to obtain the core of information."
4,"Easy to get on with, novice to just intermediate.","One of the those books that is nice for begineers but a little annoying for those with computer experience. On the whole it was good (and the humour was excellent) but it is designed as a book for beginners. Having said that, there was enough in it for myself (experience in computers but new to Corel 8) to buy it; and it at least touched on Corel 3D which was more than the official guide seemed to. If you are a beginner, get it; intemediate well maybe, and if you are already using Corel products then I wouldn't bother. I would like to see a CorelDraw 8 for Thickies which would cover the intemediate to advance topics. Come on guys, the market's out there!"
2,Useless,"Well, I don't expect much of ""Dummies ..."" but this one is below average. You will learn more from your mouse clicks and CorelDRAW help than from this book - don't waste money unless you are trully very, very lazy about learning (but than CorelDRAW is not for you anyway)."
1,Too lightweight,"Compared to the super duty, this one is very lightweight, too short, the handle is too skinny. would not recommend"
1,Too basic.,"So all this Winnie the Pooh game does is tell a story. To get farther into the story, the child has to hit a button, any button. It is too basic. No learning challenge."
5,Like fudge!,This book was so good it was better than eating fudge in the shade of a poplar tree on a hot summer day. Mmmm
4,Great 1st MP3 player for the price!,"Although the Kaser YoFun-100 isn't quite as compact and data spacious as some other models, I don't know if you can beat it for the price and quality. Initially I had some problems with the formatting instructions, but a quick email and immediate response from Kaser pointed me in the right direction (impressive customer service-a big plus in my book). Make sure that when you first format the drive (it prompts you when you first plug it in) that you choose the ""FAT"" format. You will also have to reformat if you change the preset equilizer ""modes"" but fortunately it's a quick painless process.Here is my pro-con list:Pro1. Inexpensive2. lightweight3. Easy to install and transfer files4. Expandable smart media card slotCons:1. No strap or clips to attach it to your body (I plan to attach some velcro for running)2. No low-battery warning3. USB1 cable is a little slow for file transfer (other models use the newer, faster USB2)4. Only expandable up to 128 Mb"
1,piece of junk with no support,Purchased the player and it worked fine for two months of low use. Then it stopped playing music. Can move files back and forth just fine. FAQ's at their site are pitiful so I wrote tech support- no answer in a month. I just wrote again. If you want to roll dice and hope it works then go ahead but if it doesn't you are up the creek with no paddle and no place to turn for help.
4,Good value,"I just got mine last night. So far I'm very pleased with the value I expected.Pros: Cheap, compact, light, has dc input, and SmartMedia slot (this is a big plus). Data transfering works great. 4 equalizer settings. 3 playback modes. Very nice display.Cons: Can only play MP3 format (not WMA). AA battery died right after 6 straight hrs of playing MP3. No battery indicator. So so sound quality. You definitely will need a good headphone with mega bass and a 128 MB memory card."
4,great product,"Exactly what I wanted. My macbook has awfull internal speakers, it is almost impossible to listen anything unless there is complete silence in the office.The Saitek makes the difference now, and the portability of the 4 AAA batteries is a must.I would give it 5 stars if only it could recharge the rechargable batteries, but one can dream no?Something I didn't get at the first moment is that you have to push in the center of the thing to make it expand the buffer AND this also works as the on/off button."
5,The Best Sales Skills Book Ever,This book is short simple and to the point. If you follow this sales pattern you can not help but be successful!!!Ask for the order!
3,this book is not as good as it should be,"i was attracted by the book's tiltle, and, was ecouraged to buy it. After reading through the first pages,finishing the book felt like doing your school homework.It is totally unattracting to read and the way of authoring the book is really boring. it must be rated below 5 stars for sure.i would give it 3 stars; only for the very limited valuable information it contains within."
4,One Minute Sales Person,The book arrived in good condition in a timely manner. There weren't any problems.
5,It keeps things in perspective!,"The book is designed to give the concept of ""sales"" a simple perspective. Big time sales folks would have you believe that there is a sense of mystery associated with sales, or that it is somehow magic. This book brings the entire concept down to simple levels, and points out how much of everyday life for ALL OF US... is sales. Whether one sells products, organizations, or sells oneself, it's ALL sales. Much of the book is simple and logical, and it gives its lessons by way of telling a story of a person that ultimately meets with various sales ""experts."" Each expert offers a point to remember which culminates at the end of the book with a summary of all the lessons learned. It may prove to be truly basic for some, but the majority of us don't think with such clarity and experience, so the book will certainly be a treasure for most of us. The bottom line, it puts things in perspective... and it's a perspective that a lot of us lack."
5,Excellent Primer on Closing Those Sales!,"Johnson and Wilson have written an excellent book how to close sales without putting stress on the buyer.While some of the concepts may sound basic and insulting to the reader, remember that sticking to the basics is often the best way to close the sale.Among the points the authors cover include:1. Key points to remember before you make the sales call.2. Common objections to a sale (trust is a big one!).3. Acting in the buyer's interest.4. Follow up on the sale.5. 80 - 20 rule: 20% of what we do provides 80% of the results.6. How to write out your sales goals.7. Honesty and integrity is an important part of the selling process.8. The One Minute Sales Person's Game Plan.Since I work in sales, the book has been an excellent encouragement to continue to display honesty and integrity in the selling process.Read, be encouraged to be a better salesperson, and close those sales!"
2,"Why, oh why didn't I buy this on amazon?","I bought this at an airport bookstore, for full price. It took about 45 minutes to read, and I read it very slowly. After I was done, I cursed myself for paying full price for it. I should have bought it used on amazon.As far as content, it doesn't have anything revolutionary. It's a good summary of popular sales skills, but it mostly talks about doing everything that you do in one minute. I guess that concept's cool, but the book really bangs it over your head, like a frying pan.So, it's worth reading once, but please learn from my mistake, and don't pay full price for it."
3,Very short,"Not bad, yet very short and lacking on content in comparison to many other sales related audiobooks in the same price range."
3,Great!,"Awesome book, great & helpful read. We bought this sales book for all of the sales representatives of the company."
5,Excellent material for anyone focused on the customer!,This title provides an excellent perspective for anyone focused on the CUSTOMER. This small and easy to use reference clearly identifies key elements of the buying experience. A must read for those who want to improve personal results by making certain the CUSTOMER is understood and their needs are met.
4,A good overview,"Order this book after a proable diagonosis of AS from the Rheumatologist who wasn't very helpful on the self help and management of it. I know that there can be a wide range of patient symptoms and progression of the condition and in writing a book like this it needs to target us all. I don't need drug managment but wanted to do the best I could to keep it that way. The main thing I got that was helpful for me is it was good to work on posture correction, chest expansion, flexiablity and mobility of the joints of the spine. I have since went to a pilates based physiotherapist and got a home program that I could do daily to work on theses things. I found the book informative about diagnosis and disease progression. It is less helpful on natural alternatives and diet modification. It is written by a rheumatologist who is working within his scope of practice. Probably with more understanding on it and what we would like to know because he has the condition."
3,Lots of Info.,"I purchased this book for my husband who is battling AS, when he was first diagnosed & it was all so new to us. The book is very informative about the condition and somewhat thorough. I didn't find it very personal though. Since the author is an AS sufferer himself I just expected a more personal approach to his story telling. He gives you the basic, clinical facts & conventional medical treatments, no more, no less."
1,Do not order this if you value your time!!!,Canx'ed order TWICE due to super-duper slow shipping- shame on me!!! Do yourself a favor and go somewhere other than Amazon for this one.
4,Intriguing and intense,"Although this is not a typical horror book, I could not put it down. There are a few points where the witchcraft of Necole and Felicia were not believable (hence the 4 stars), but the other parts make up for it.From the back cover-""Necole McAnglin was outwardly a normal thirteen-year-old, but she harbored within her secrets of a dark and terrifying past. The time had come for the balance of a sinister debt to be paid-and Necole was the price.With wings that fanned the fires of hell, and fiendish red eyes of death, it rose from the slimy pits of the underworld to claim Necole as its own. The girl's body became a battleground for good and evil, and she not only had to save her life, but her very soul from an eternity of agony and torment."""
4,"Good, but disappointing","Earlier this year I read the same author's ""Touched by Fire,"" which is one of the best accounts of the land war in the Pacific that I have ever read. I just finished ""Fire in the Sky."" It is an above average book but is disappointing when compared to the earlier book. Unlike ""Touched by Fire,"" ""Fire in the Sky"" drags in places. The book picks up considerably whenever the author uses first hand accounts of service in Pacific and of combat itself. Unlike the earlier book, however, these accounts are more limited in presenting the Japanese perspective.This is a very good book and I would certainly recommend it. However, it requires a little more patience than Mr. Bergerud's earlier book."
2,"Great thesis, miserable execution","I plowed through this tome from front to back. If you pick it up in the bookstore, it's fascinating. If you you sit down to read it, it's infuriating. It's at least a third longer than it should be, due to incessant repetition, contradiction, lack of editing, & general incoherence. Was this book ever edited? It's stream of consciousness history, & it doesn''t work. Nonetheless, the author's thesis, that the defeat of Japan occurred in the Southwest Pacific air battles between spring 1942 and spring 1944, is worth something. I found his ideas fascinating, to the extent his pathetic writing style allowed me to grasp them. But I can't in good faith recommend this author. His writing & organization is beyond incompetent. I can't understand how a book ever got into print in this condition."
4,Buying on Kindle for the Maps?,"Don't expect to read any of the included maps in the Kindle edition. They are tiny and scanned so poorly the text is illegible even under magnification.Additionally, the page numbering system is cryptic to say the least: Don't bother to try to go to ""previous page"" from a bookmark; it won't happen.In spite of these shortcomings, I'm enjoying the read."
5,A great book for the right reader,"""Fire in the Sky"" is a great book, indeed a real treasure, for the right reader. It is laden with detail about the conditions of war in the southwest Pacific after Guadalcanal. How they lived, what difficulties they faced getting into the air in a functioning machine, how the air campaign is fought are just a few of the issues the author explores in detail. And why is the book not for everyone? It is again the detail. If you've read and enjoyed John Lundstrom's books and other histories of early combat in the pacific - you are ready for 'Fire in the Sky"". If you've not read, or not enjoyed those books I'd suggest you start with the 'First Team' duo, or 'Shattered Sword'. The detail is less overwhelming, and the narrative rather more coherent than 'Fire'."
5,A must-read for those interested in the subject matter,"Fire In the Sky must be the best book I've ever read about the air war in the South Pacific during World War II. It's outstanding. It addresses all kinds of things that most books on the subject don't, like providing a detailed description of self-sealing fuel tanks and the differences between radial and in-line engines. It also includes lengthy first-person accounts from pilots and crew of many types of planes, from both sides.It doesn't really recount the history of the battles or the war, but it does go into living conditions, mission types, analyses of plane types, morale, leadership qualities, roles of land bases, tactics, and so on. It's some 750 pages long and worth every penny, that's for sure. Highly recommended if you happen to have an interest in the subject matter..."
3,Not bad but not good.....,"Many may buy this album purely because Change the World (the Inuyasha theme song) is on here. While that is an awesome song, the rest of the album isn't quite as good. There are a few good songs other than Change the World, but many of them are ok or just plain wierd. It probably would help if I understood the lyrics but not the point.....Furthermore, if you get this album factory sealed, it comes with a poster of the band and what I like to call a ""Commemorative Squishy""-a blue foam-thing on a chain that resembles the pattern on the album cover. While I have no idea what to do with this ""squishy"", it's an interesting little bonus.Overall I recommend you think twice before buying it. Don't be lured in purely because it's a means of obtaining Change the World."
3,Good CD,The CD was a little scratched up but I knew that when I bought it used. I wouldn't play in my home CD player but I was able to put on my IPod so for the price it was a good deal.
5,Amazing Live Acoustic cd,"This is a great cd containing the best acoustic performances of all time, is a memorable album also contains covers of AC / DC and Beatles. To complete the collection of Maroon 5 this item can not miss. I loved it."
3,Not impressed,"Oncce again you can't expect an artist to be great all the time, and this wasn't any differant, buy it if you want but not something I would buy again"
4,A must-have CD!,"I really enjoy this CD. I could have done without the covers, as I don't enjoy those particular songs, but that is my only complaint! If you are concerned about how Adam sounds live . . .fear not . . . he and the rest of the guys do a great job on this."
1,booooooo,"This CD is definitely not worth it. It's a complete disappointment. I thought Adam Levine's voice would be impressive recorded live but it isn't. And there's nothing special about it, the songs sound just like they do on the radio except slightly lower quality because it's a live recording. Sadly the most amusing thing on the CD is the cover of ""highway to hell"" that made me almost pee my pants laughing."
2,waste of money,"I have the studio recording Songs About Jane and it's amazing, but now I'm listening to this album with acoustic versions and I just don't like it at all...I was going to buy it, but thanks to the Amazon Music Sampler, because I heard 15 seconds of This Love and I got bored! It's really a waste of money, and it's definitely better to buy the studio version than this...other thing. I give it 2 stars because the songs included here are great in the normal album."
2,Too Frickin' Short,It's 2 short and is acoustic. That means its a frickin' letdown.We need the real Maroon 5 plz
1,Bon Scott must be rolling over in his grave.,"i don't really like Maroon 5 (too popular), but some of the songs are ok, as my friends made me listen to this album (torture). Highway to Hell is an insult to AC/DC members. It is a nice song with a truly memorable riff. The guitars here, though, have too much bass and sound as though someone has too much phelgm in his throat. Dums are too punkish, not metal enough. Now, if you want to play music by a band in the rock n roll hall of fame, which is heavy metal, but don't sound metal enough, why play it?"
4,i love live cd's,I think this album should've been longer... but since it's live it gets more stars than I usualy give albums. The only song I don't care for on the cd is Highway to Hell. The best song is She Will Be Loved.
4,Almost an excellent Album..........,"Nice acoustic versions of the songs. This shows Maroon 5 has some real talent. Album is great except the last track. They should have NEVER covered AC/DC's ""Highway To Hell"". The guitar is very good, but the vocal's suck! Bonus Track? What is bonus about it. Bonus denotes ADDED value. This track just takes away from the cd. I was excited when I first heard the intro guitar riff but then I heard the vocals. Collective Soul also tried to cover this at a live show with no success either."
2,"Too much Harriet, too little help","For someone running a small business or thinking of starting one, emotional strength can prove as important as a business plan. Harriet Rubin is on to a great topic here, but she ruins the book by her staggering self-indulgence, name dropping and bragging about how much money she makes. Someone who wants insight into what being in business for yourself is really like would do better with Spare Room Tycoon, by James Chan. That book has the advantage of drawing on the experience of dozens of other entrepreneurs, and it's better written besides."
2,Very weak,"As a freelancer, I'm always on the look-out for books that can help me. Unfortunately, this isn't one. It's mostly the author's own self-indulgent musings, along with a few conversations she's had with others. There's no real research and the advice is mostly obvious things like saving money before you go solo. Maybe I had too high expectations given the author's background, but the book seems like a rush job. It doesn't even have an index, which made it even harder to find what little useful information the book contains. A real disappointment."
2,A few insights; a lot of attitude,"This book did offer some interesting psychological insights about breaking away from the corporation to work on your own. Unfortunately, the book was marred by repetition, uneven writing and most notably, the arrogant tone of the author. It seems as if first and foremost, the author is concerned with letting the reader know what a special human being she is. She tells us that people in the middle to upper range of experience shouldn't offer their services for less than $5,000-10,000 a day, and inserts an unnecessary chart showing us all the money she made. While she does this with an outward tone of ""you can do this too,"" she is intelligent enough to know that most of us won't be commanding this money. I was offended by her condescention. Nonetheless, I admire her shrewd self-marketing. I just wish I hadn't bought the book."
1,"Useless, redundant, and badly edited","Ms. Rubin's book is shamelessly self-indulgent and just plain pointless. I had hoped to get some solid ideas about working for myself and realized that this book was pretty much useless for anyone who doesn't have Ms. Rubin's golden parachute. Not all of us have the option of asking our former employer to give us a bailout. Although she repeatedly insisted that she had to start from ground zero because she was going into a new field, it was very obvious her contacts from her former career came in oh-so-handy. She couched the one or two good points she had in endless poorly-edited prose (I couldn't even make sense of some of the sentences), randonly placed quotes, and pointless ""insights"". Don't waste your time.Ms. Rubin's REAL secret to soloing is convincing people to pay money to read her mediocrity."
1,Pathetic,"I have never before read a book that fills 340 pages (well, I sorta gave up after 200 or so) and manages to say absolutely nothing at all. Unlike some reviewers, I wasn't expecting a freelance how-to, I assumed the book would be about the emotional fallout of soloing and offer insights for handling the ups and downs of a solo life. Well, it does attempt that at some level, but falls flat time after time. Rubin just can't hide the fact that the main reason for her success is her ability to maintain her cushy, ""I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine"" relationships with big money movers and shakers and power brokers like Jim Moore, Nina Brink, and of course her main squeeze, Avram Miller. The message of this book is, to live a life like Harriet Rubin's, just go out and get Harriet Rubin's friends! Easy, huh? That little tidbit of info will cost you $.... But nah, you're not about to get suckered into that deal....like I was....are you?"
2,Disappointing,"I thought this book would help me in my solo business. I was wrong. Really wrong. The author has done almost no research; she offers no insights at all. (For example, her tax advice is to save your receipts. Duh.) My uneducated guess is that she's just trying to cash in on a big trend without really understanding it or having anything of value to say."
1,Borrow it from a friend,"My husband gave me this book for Christmas because I have been a soloist for 10 months. I applaud Harriet's courage and belief in herself to write a book and share what she has learned. I came away with a handful of good, solid insights. Now, the constructive criticism, I'm surprised that such a stellar editor/publisher would have such a wordy book. It would have been much better if it was condensed to half of its current size. Additionally, after the third or fourth reference to Avram, I was completely convinced that they were a couple. Thus, a tremendous amount of credibility was immediately lost. I love my husband very much and he has been my #1 supporter, but, I don't think it is responsible to pass him off as some kind of expert or sage and cite pithy quotations that he has spouted in our conversations. A wise soloist (and author) should have more integrity than this. Worth skimming, but borrow it from a friend."
1,Save money; don't buy this,"Rubin's writing style makes the reader feel as if she's talking down to her audience. The entire book was disorganized and kept saying the same thing over and over. ""We get the point,"" I wanted to say. She needed a good edit (duh, she's an editor) on her chapters, which seemed to be repeating themselves.Rubin's book is not a product of a great thinking. Be ready for generalized comments and suggestions that seem to go on forever. Save your money and buy some books from leading business gurus: Drucker, Maslow, Wheatley."
1,"Very self-congratulatory; borrow it, don't buy it","This isn't a book about really making a soloing career happen. While Rubin may have found a catchy title, her content is vague, and the tone is very self-congratulatory and condescending.I have become a ""soloist"" myself and thought this book would provide useful information or, at the very least, comaderie for those of us who are out on our own. It provides neither. Rubin spends almost all of the book congratulating herself on her accomplishments. She also makes totally arbitrary divisions between soloing and entrepreneuring, as it this is really somehow relevant.In summary: a waste of a good title."
1,"That's a heck of a caveat, Bobby.","Maybe it's just me, but I'd rather read a book by someone who really went solo rather than by someone who went solo to write a book.Welcome back to the land of expense accounts, Harriet. Thanks for your brief fly-over of our world."
2,"To much babble, not enough meat","I usually will research a book online[...] before buying. The title caught my eye and after a quick preview decided to take a chance. The first couple of chapters and the table of contents got me pumped, but after that I could barely finish it because of the babble and musings. There is some good information in the book, but not enough to justify buying. A much better book is ""Kiss Off Corporate America"" by Lisa Kivirist. It's also a motivational type book for going solo, but I found it more practical and a much easier read."
1,Don't Bother,"It would be interesting to hear an entrepreneur's direct and uncensored views on starting a business as they are doing it. This is not that book.This is the overwrought account of a mid-life crisis. Lots of people experience mid-life course changes. Most folks don't air the details in public. Ms. Rubin, perhaps like most people who publish diaries, should have thought twice."
2,Superficial,"I was disappointed in this travel guide-- Lonely Planet's is far superior. I didn't find much of the information I was seeking in the index-- as an example, there's no index entry for ""Monteverde""-- one of the most popular destinations."
3,where this story likely came from,"All who see this film should read John Steinbeck's play ""The Moon is Down""."
5,This Book is a LifeSaver!,Was diagnosed with IC and this book really helped me to understand IC and what I am up against and what I need to do to heal myself. It's so wonderful to know that one can heal oneself. This book self empowers you!
5,Solving the Interstitial Cystitis Puzzle: A Guide to Natural Healing,"Bought this book for my wife who suffers from IC. She is very pleased with the book and looks forward to the benefits she will receive from its contents. And bye the way, this book arrived faster than any book I have purchased from Amazon, ordered it on Friday Dec 26 and received it on Monday Dec 29. Thank You."
2,Too Hard to understAND,This book is more for a person that is in the medical field not for a plain person like me that had just found out about their condition
5,Industrial Rock doesn't get much better than...,"I ordered this the other day and I cannot stop listening to it! I have followed Rammstein and I was able to get tickets to the Family Values Tour! If you are big into music like Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, and Monster Magnet. I really think you will like this! What a collectors item!"
5,This collection is a must-have for serious Rammstein fans.,"This 6 CD collection showcases Rammstein's many different styles of music since they started recording in 1994. This set consists of their first 6 singles - Du riechst so gut, Seemann, Engel, Engel [fan-edition], Du hast, and Das Modell. Overall, there are 5 album versions of songs from Herzeleid, 4 album versions of songs from Sehnsucht, 4 remixes or edits of songs from Herzeleid, 4 remixes or edits of songs from Sehnsucht, 2 live demos, 2 completely new tracks, and a computer game. I've found the live demos and new cuts to be entertaining, and several of the remixes are good. Considering what you could pay for each of these singles seperately (I've seen some for around $15 each), the box set is a good value. Plus, you get a nice collector's box and a band poster."
5,*shuddering orgasm*,You haven't felt pleasure until you've been brought to a mind-blowing climax by the arrival of this set in your mail box...an explosive feeling surpassed only by the events that transpire after you start listening to the music..words fail me...BUY IT NOW! SERVE YOUR PASSION!
5,This Boxed set is a definate must have!,"Rammstein fans, this is a must have. I paid the $50 for this, and was well worth it if it had been $75. I was a little disappointed with the poster you recieve with it. They don't look like the *** kickers they are in the poster, more like a bunch of guys from Happy Days or something (sweater vests and all.) Other than that little piddly thing, this is a real collectors item. The box is really cool that comes with it too."
5,JUST BUY IT,"If you are serious about learning Chinese, even as a beginner, you need this book written by a serious and brilliant academic. The presentation is extremely clear and the grammatical basis is immaculate. Ultimately, this book will help you revise root words you have just learnt and learn new ones based on root words. It will also give you usage examples in Chinese and pinyin. So, why wait ? Go ahead and get it... NOW !!!"
5,This book always travels with me,"If I had to choose a single book for learning/reviewing Mandarin Chinese (Putonghua) this is the one. I have been learning Mandarin for about 2 years now and purchased many other Chinese learning texts and this book is the best. One of my favorite features is to open up the book at a random character and see if I can understand the sample sentences without looking at the accompanying Pinyin. If I miss a character, I find the corresponding Pinyin and look it up in the alphabetical index. Of course there are characters used in the sample sentences that are not in the top 500 and I have other dictionaries for this purpose (this book only deals systematically with 500 most common characters from most common to least). As other reviewers have mentioned the detailed grammatical explanations of many characters (e.g. de/le/shi/guo) are invaluable for general understanding."
5,Hands down the best book I ever read!!,"I have read this book a number of times and glean new wisdom every time. It explained every mystery of human relationship that has baffled me for 50 years. The insight I gained helps me understand other people as well as myself in both personal and professional relationships. Hollis can synthesize Jung better than any author or teacher working today, and uses literature and poetry which greatly enriches his writing. All of James Hollis books are exemplarary and I recommend them all. I have been fortunate enough to hear Hollis speak and he is even better in real life. Extremely wise and empathetic. I have also given this book as a gift to many of my friends and colleagues.I find the previous review very interesting and reveals more to me about the author of the review than this book!!"
5,REAL UNDERSTANDING,I've read everything by Hollis and this one stands out. A truly eye opening exposure of how we transfer the responsibility for our own deficiencies to another person.
2,Disappointing,"The quality of this DVD is horrible. But that said, I'm still very glad to have it. Was without question, the game of the century!"
5,An amazing look at an important part of our history.,This is an awesome book about some of the early spiritual battles that were (and are) so critical in the history of Virginia and the United States. Hard to put this one down!
3,So far...so good,"I am reading this book as a student in literature class. We as a class have only read up through chapter 5. So far it is a good book. However I would not recommend this book to anybody who is very sensitive,beacuse this is a very sad,and true story. There are some parts that are boring so you have to be paient with the book. This book is very popular amongst my class. So if you are interested in true stories i would recommend this book."
5,Tells the story of GENOCIDE without being too graphic,"It is very difficult to understand what the Turkish empire along with it's co-conspirators did to the Armenians. It is very difficult to grasp how humanity can commit such acts. It's a story told through the eyes of a young girl. Initially, I thought that it would be very graphic and heavy in depicting the genocide. Fortunately, there is no 'hollywood' in this book. The story is told without exaggerations as the young girl is witness to many people dying through disease, starvation, etc. I'm going to pass this on to my kids for reading. It has passed my litmus test for what is appropriate for kids (and adults) to read these days."
5,Touching on so many levels.,"I married an Armenian man, and when we decided to have a child, I decided to learn about his heritage. The story reminds him of those told by his own grandmother who escaped death and arrived in America during the same time period. I recommend this book to anyone who is related to or knows an Armenian."
5,The road from home,This book is like an Armenian Ann Frank. You feel you know the family. It was very well written.
1,reality,"One of the rules of writing history is objectivitism. A historian should write what really happened, looking through every perspective. A reviewer must therefore write about the book...we really donot wanna know about the history...Besides i really cannot understand if it is so easy to believe everthing written in a book, like this one. I am really so for the trees cut down for this book to be written in...such a waste"
4,"A bit long, but does the job",I wish this was slightly shorter. It works well and pumps fast. Seems quite sturdy. I would recommend this to other users looking for a ball pump they won't lose.
2,Not for valves,"Does not work with Schrader valves (the valved nozzle type commonly found on bikes tires, car tires, etc... refer to wikipedia for better definition).This is because shcrader valves have a pin that must be depressed in order to allow air to go into the object you are inflating.Most bike pumps have a piece within the attaching nozzle that will depress this pin and allow you to inflate, however, the attachments that come with this pump do not. Therefor, this pump will not inflate things such as bike tires."
5,phlebogirl,"I loved my book Linda Leal Miller is a awseome Author. I am always looking for books that she has written, love the historical novals the best. She can make me feel like I am there with the characters in the book. She can make me laugh and cry all in the same story."
2,Willow,Ordinarily Linda Lael Miller is one of my favorite authors-- but I didn't like this one at all. Trite and uninteresting. Sorry.
2,Disappointing.,"Willow is a remake or redo or rewrite - wish she would have just left it alone. I think it was much better as a shorter story. What's up with the heroines lately? Is it just me or do they make others want to toss the book across the room in frustration. She is, to me, the most immature, foolish & unthinking character. She goes ahead and does things that bring great hurt to others, e.g. like her father, then does the equivalent of ""oops"" guess that was the wrong thing to do. Hard for me to imagine how anyone could have found her that lovable to put up with such infantile behavior. Just bought it at the store & it will go up for sale. Linda Lael Miller can do so much better which makes this even more of a shame."
1,Only if you like annoying characters that can't make up their minds,"I saw that this was originally a much shorter story, which was lengthened by Ms. Miller. Like the bandaid being ripped off quickly, she should have left it alone. Shorter would have been much less painful for this reader.Authors should leave their earlier publications alone. Even if it was not a good book, it's just embarrassing when the author tries to fix it -- and inevitably makes it worse.This one doesn't even rate one star. Come on, Ms. Miller, we all know you are capable of much better."
5,WILLOW,"A new concept of writing. Story held your attention, as usual for Linda Miller. Great reading. I fell in love with the main character."
5,Great reading,I get nearly all my books from you or through Kindle. Easy ordering and great service. I try to get all book from this author.
1,Poor quality.....Piece of junk!!!! Feel apart after one wash,I purchased this for my sons sports themed room a few months ago. After one wash on delicate it fell to pieces. It has huge holes in it in 3 different places. The quality is very poor. The quilt material is very thin. A big waste of money.
4,Cooler than Shaft!!,"Hanzo is cooler than all the other ""loose cannon"" cops in cinema. Period.About the story though: the plots kind of drops off in the resolution, not really doing a good job of performing resolution."
2,Not useful for railings,"I'm in the process of remodeling my house and am replacing a stair railing. I used information from instructions the stair parts manufacturers produce and help from a stair parts salesman to figure out the parts I would need but needed some additional help in actually installing it. I found this book at a woodworking show and thought I was set. Unfortunately almost all it covers is the design and constructions of the stairs themselves. The design and construction of the railing is barely touched on. I got more information from the manufacturer's instructions and the instructions that came with some of the installation hardware.I can't really comment on how good the stair construction information is since that's not what I was interested in, but I can't recommend this at all if your looking for information on stair railing design and construction.If you're looking for railing information I would recommend the book ""Stairs: The Best of Fine Homebuiling"". (ISBN 1561581313)"
2,The Price Is Right - The Book Is Wrong,"Like the photograph on the cover, this book is not what it seems. The text is simplistic, skimming the surface of a topic that people can devote a rich lifetime to studying.I bought it on the price and the strength of the cover photograph, because I'm Scottish (i.e. cheap), felt ambitious, and wanted to build a circular staircase from scratch.The book doesn't touch on that subject at all. The cover ""photograph"" is actually a poorly-rendered computer graphic, and the text inside matches it well.(By the way: DO NOT attempt to build a circular staircase from scratch unless you have years of woodworking under your belt, a very complete workshop at your disposal, are completely comfortable with extremely complex geometry, and have a source of income that allows you infinite free time :-)"
1,outrageously bad edition,"Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 are identical. The book is missing the real Chapter 1, so I feel that it is a big ripoff. The typography is amateurish (typewriter quotes, no real long dashes, a blank line between every paragraph--what is this, a business letter?). This is evidently a publisher that knocks together books that are in the public domain without the least attention to quality. I can't believe they charge so much for so little."
3,Only for the Antony fan,"This isn't the best piece of music - I would say only someone who already knows they like Antony and the Johnsons would appreciate it. And, if you think you like them because of his awesome covering of Leonard Cohen's ""If it be you will"" then you might want to think again. Personally, that bit Antony did for the ""I'm your Man"" dvd is the only thing I truly like that I have heard from him. Still, I respect his talent and his originality."
1,flat characters in the deep sea,"While theoretically a great story, Mr. Kelly manages to deaden this high seas adventure with flat dialogue and one dimensional characters. That he admittedly (in an interview on April 9 on KLRE/KUAR radio in Little Rock) chose ""Bluto"" as the prototype for the first mate/antagonist Keeler is painfully evident. After the first third of the book, I found myself skimming the remaining surface of the novel just to follow the story to its conclusion. It's a shame that this amazing true story with reasonably detailed information on the clipper ship era sinks under the weight of leaden characters and dialogue."
5,Family night play,A big favourite in our family night playtime. This game can be played at different levels. Our beginner reader soon recognised the letters and knew how to play. But before that we played lots of variations of the game so everyone could take part. We also teamed up with weaker players when friends come around.The cards are clear not as durable to withstand a younger siblings grasp. A cloth drawstring bag would be a welcome addition to the set to keep everything together and transport it. It's too easy for the cards to spread when the box is opened by little hands.Firm favourite and well used in our family. It's also a great dinner icebreaker.
2,Oh!,"I realise this CD offering has been edited from the original 6hrs, but it still drags. People were young when they first entered the Met. that night. I am sure James Levine enjoyed it, and possible some of the audience. Can only be watched in parts, not as a whole. I love Placido Domingo, and even he seems at a loss. The German repetoire over-represented."
2,(yawn),"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Not unlike watching the hundred hour previews before the Oscars or SuperBowl... lots of glitter, much pomp, much applause (especially for old favorites)and a couple of good bits. Best taken in small doses."
4,Amazing !!!,This book is a greart book for me it is a very good poem book. i love this book. amazing.
4,A Horse Book,"A very old book meant for the young reader about how to know horses. Charming in its quaintness, life from another age."
2,A horse book,It's alright but a lot of poems about horses. I would read this book if you like poems and horses but I don't really care for it.
1,worth what I paid,"I got this as a free biok. It gave ne sonething to read while I waited, so it did the job."
2,...,It's good if you want a guide to owning a horse. I was thinking it was going to be a story but it wasn't.
2,A horse book,I liked this book but when I downloaded it i thought it wouldn't be poems but I`d give it five stars I would also recommend this book to all people who love horses
4,It's good but not great,This book has good poems and does teach u about horses and why they act like they do .but this is not a very entertaining book so I would not recommend it for children younger than 10
4,great robot series,"This is a great series. The second season does not have an English dub due to poor sales of the first season, but does not detract from the quality of the series. There is at least a bit of a divergence from the ""monster of the day"" style of the first season, with more of an ongoing story, but does not shy away from the over-the-top mecha antics, and still succeeds in taking itself way too seriously (intentionally, I assure you, and gives some great humor to the series). If you enjoyed the first season, continue with the second and keep the fun going!"
5,Worth the Money,"I am a neat freak and like to take care of my cars. But I still hesitated on spending this much on floor mats. I had the other rubbery weather techs in my last truck and they were good but, THESE ARE GREAT! I love how they go up the sides and over the door jam just enough for total coverage. FYI, the grey floormats look a little off on the websites but match perfectly to my grey F150 interior. Worth the high price."
1,Disappointed,"I was hoping to learn about the history, agriculture, and culture of Puerto Rico before my family visited the island. How very disappointed I was!!!!!! This is just an old, black and white, 1940's propaganda film, out of date and nothing like the island is today."
4,Ambiguous and Dubious,"Opens in stunning fashion with the hero discovering a photograph of his wife, cited as the Marquise de Brinvilliers, in a book of famous poisoners. Following the suspicious death by arsenical poisoning of a neighbour and the vanishing of his corpse from a sealed granite crypt, he becomes convinced that she is a witch risen from the dead. Carr makes this bizarre plot quite convincing through an atmosphere which relies far more on understatement than it does on the thick effects of the Bencolins (or even Hag's Nook). Unfortunately, Carr follows a highly logical and quite convincing plot with a supernatural one that makes nonsense of the other, yet, owing to references made in later books, impossible to credit, making the reader uncertain of what to believe. Thus is a good story and considerable ingenuity tossed carelessly out the window."
3,Another sealed room mystery but with a twist.,"Advertised as a ""gothic horror"" novel, this book again offers Mr. Carr the opportunity to present an impossible crime. The twist to this is the reader is uncertain if the crime was an ordinary murder or was in fact committed by a legendary murderess, returned from the dead. Written in 1937, the book ages well but there is little to separate it from others of the genre"
1,This was not was I was looking for...,I meant to order the Kregel edition of Luther's Commentary on Galatians. That's the one that I am familiar with and the one which is historically referenced many times. I don't know this version and the text was different from sentence one. Don't buy it. Buy the Kregel Edition!
3,grammar for ESL,The workbook is good but the format is a little bit jumbled. Lists should be in the appendix and cross referenced
2,shipment is too slow and book has many scratch,"shipment is too slow and book has many scratch, i can not track my book so i didnt know where is"
5,"Truform 20-30 Below Knee Open Toe Beige, Medium.",Excellent product I have been a Sigvaris user for 25 years but for quarter of the price of Sigvaris this product is a god send for me Amazon has never disappointed me.
3,foot run bigs,I do not belive these run true to size. That being said ... I do like the product; the sizing is just a little big.
5,A great fit.,New energy for my legs. Just what you need for tried aching legs. They have just the right amount of pressure for my legs. I would definitely order them again.
4,Good product.,"The product is fine, but the information on the site didn't bring the size to my attention. While the medium is ok, my dr. said I needed small. I'll still use these, I'm sure."
4,Compression stockings for my 12 hour shifts,"I purchased these stockings because I stand for 12+ hours at my job. When I wear these, I don't have issues with achy calves or swollen feet. The open toe design is great because your toes are free to wiggle around. They are pretty easy to put on. I wear my trouser socks over them. They also help prevent varicose veins and blood clots. I will definitely be purchasing more. Before I discovered Dansko clogs and compression stockings, my feet, legs, and back were all very sore even after an 8 hour day. Now I don't have many issues with aches and pains caused by standing for long periods of time.I recommend measuring yourself before ordering so that they fit correctly."
3,Works pretty good. Is HOT for summer,"The socks went up too high on my 5'4"" wife's legs, so she had to fold them down at the top. Not ideal, but worked. She is using them in the summer time and these are very dense and therefore hot. We've used other socks that are much lighter material that we prefer."
3,Helpful but not durable,"Purchased these after many months of leg pain at work. My chair was resulting in awful, long-lasting pain in my thighs. Tried these out of desperation and they were a good choice for pain relief. The first time wearing them the pain was gone. Really enjoy that the toes are opened-- helps with airflow, feels less constricted, and you can still wear open-toed shoes without anyone noticing the stockings. The only cons are that wearing them more than once can result in smelly feet, and they don't hold-up very well in the washer (even on a hand-wash cycle). I would recommend actually hand washing these or expect to reorder every month. They are available through subscribe & save with Amazon, which takes 15% off each order, so if you go through these quickly, at least Amazon offers a little savings."
1,Worthless!!!,"Do not waste your money on any version of JE Taylors Tolkien books. He hides his ""references"" at the back of the book instead of professionally citing them on the page for the entry you are reading. If you are a Tolkien purist you will find many fictional made up details in this book. Instead buy the book that Christopher Tolkien himself cites...Robert Foster's Complete Guide to Middle Earth. This book is VERY accurate for your Hobbit,LOTR, Simarillion reference needs.If you need a cross-reference for the 12 volumes of the History of Middle Earth buy Christopher Tolkiens Index to the History of Middle Earth. You can buy that at Amazon UK."
5,The Tolkien Companion,"'The Tolkien Companion' is a brilliant guide to 'The Hobbit', 'The Lord of the Rings', and 'The Silmarillion'. It tells of many peoples, places, and things throughout Middle-earth and the Undying Lands. Anything I do not understand in author J.R.R. Tolkien's world is uniquely explained from this must-own book tribute. I highly recommend you buy 'The Tolkien Companion'!"
5,Reflections On Bigger is Better,"Carol Johnston offers a helpful review of economic theory the offers reflections on modern consumerism. Bigger is not necessarily better and security won't absolutely follow money. She contends that what's needed is strong relationships with Self, Family, Community and God to really feel safe and secure. Excellent read!"
3,Review of Wamsutta Pique Kind Comforter,"Quality-wise, this product is OK. But the horrible part is, it looks very ugly and repulsive. This product was purchased by me as a brand new item, but its appearance looks very old and seems this product is used by somebody else."
2,Movies Freeze,2 of the movies freeze for a second in 1 scene of each of the 2 movies. I'm not crazy about them doing that.
2,Poor Quality Blue Ray DVD,The blue-ray DVD that I received started out great but as the movie progressed it started to fade (darker). I plan to return the set and request a differnt set. Probably a malfunction in the production process.
5,Blue-Ray Version!!!,"I love these movies and bought the Blue-Rays even though I have the DVD's. The video, sound and clarity is amazing compared to the DVD's. If your a fan of these movies the blue-rays give it justice and well woth getting.."
3,"It would get a better rating if ""Crystal Skull"" wasn't included","It's great to have the old movies in Blu-Ray.The bonus features are great.Spielberg pretty much admits that ""Temple of Doom"" sucked, and kinda blames Lucas.But, damn, ""Crystal Skull"" is horrific. And the bonus features make it seem even worse."
5,Indiana Jones,I think Harrison Ford is a terrific actor and he makes these stories great. Anyone who likes adventure stories will like this item.
4,Great Upgrade for a Classic Series,"Picked this up when it was on sale for 40$. All films look and sound great, and are noticably better than their DVD counterparts.Raiders fares the worst of the bunch but still managers to look quite good. Temple and Crusade had a bigger budget and it shows in the presentation.These are some of my favorite films; its great to finally see them in high definition."
5,Classic Series on Blu Ray - at last,"Regardless of how you feel about the 4th one (which I liked a lot -- yes, you read that right), it's great to have all 4 movies together remastered in Hi Def. The picture and sound are fantastic, and the first movie looks especially good considering its age. The only issue is the bonus features are mostly from the standard DVD set which came out in 2003 and they look a bit harsh in Hi Def for some reason, but that's a very minor criticism. This is a must have set of movies, so until/if/when they make another one I highly recommend you get this and see Dr Jones in all his whip-cracking glory."
5,Great package,I was very impressed with the package it came in and of course I love Indiana Jones. Sometimes I run all the movies back to back.
5,Great!,Was a gift for my husband. He loves it and says so far great quality! He has only watched episode one.
5,Just watched first 3 in a row,"Wow how time flies, almost had me tear up at then end of crusade when they ride off into the sunset. As for the quality there's only two scenes in the first 3 movies where for some reason the picture gets blurry, and it's not just my copy. When Indy and his helper have spiders on their backs, and when Indy sala and indys dad are in a car, does the same thing perfect picture then blurs. As for each picture quality it gets better for each movie, Venice looked beautiful. They still never fixed the audio bite in temple of doom when their floating in the raft and Winnie is saying she hates this and that and when the word you gets yelled out its a guys voice, indys mouth is shut, another funny thing I just noticed is when their on the blimp. Connery has the newspaper in his hand reading it upside down the entire scene lol just some funny little things oh and u can still see the glass seperation when Marion falls in front of the cobra, u can see the reflection."
5,"Indiana at his best, over and over again!",What a thrill to see again the classic Indiana Jones in this complete set of his adventures. Excellent collection to have and to enjoy.
4,Great Movie Set,I had forgotten how great these movies were. I would have given it 5 stars except the video quality was not to Blu-ray standard.
3,Grainy,"I'm very happy to finally have Raiders of the Lost Ark on Blu Ray, but the conversion isn't as good as I'd hoped. It may be that they can only work with the quality of the original 35mm, and bringing a ton of clarity to it reveals flaws. Most of the early part of the movie in South America is grainy as if the lighting was poor. And you can see the focus go in and out during some of the cave scenes. The color also seems a little over-saturated and the blacks are a little heavy. I'm sure it's better than standard definition, but it didn't come out as well as the Blu Ray release of Star Wars."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. I was disappointed with the very slim, flimsy DVD case, and my second DVD (Temple of Doom) froze and quit working forever 5 minutes into the movie."
2,1 and one half stars might have sufficed!,"First off, the first three of the set are superb films anyday. I had to and still do kind of struggle through the newest film... Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and do not particularly fancy it.Indiana Jones was a household name as I was growing up and that was the primary reason I bought this set. But considering the poor audio quality, I would really advice any one to buy the single film editions, especially if you have the first three already. The music background is fine, but supercedes the voice clarity causing you to struggle to follow the film."
1,"Watch the South Park episode ""The China Probrem""","All anyone ever needs to do to know what this movie is like, watch the episode of South Park called ""The China Probrem"" (episode number 175).To sum it up. ""He was raped!""Poor Indiana Jones. We will never be able to look at him the same!"
1,Indiana Jones Complete collection,"I love these movies and have collected them up to until now...I hate enhanced wide screen dvds...widescreen is fine, but enhanced wide screen with several inches cut off my screen makes it hard for people like me (1) who don't own a wide-screen TV (2) legally blind who can't go to the theater to see the movie.....very difficult to view the movies without being 2 inches from the TV set. I understand that the dvd industry is forcing people to buy these as their only choice if they want to own the movie, but they lost my business and I don't think I'm alone in wondering why both formats can't be offered on dvd sets..full and wide screen...so we the comsumer can actually feel like we are in control of choosing the type of product we would like to purchase instead of ""settling"" for all that we can get. I am afraid that disabled people like me are going to lose out again."
1,poorly advertised,I do not understand why do you have this video advertised and not have an available date and even a picture cover. Very poorly done. Nobody will be interested in purchasing your collection this way.
5,classic movies,"The Indiana Jones movies are all classics, they'll be watched long after most movies from this era are forgotten (most already are forgotten). I'm not going to review the movies, that's been done 2 billion times already, but I will say I enjoy all 4, yes even 'Crystal Skull'. The ending was as plausible as any other Indy movie, really. Indiana Jones movies now have everything, including aliens. These movies are pure escapism, action, over the top, non-stop. That's what makes them so watchable.I saw this set and knew right away I had to have it. The picture quality is top rate, especially with an upconverting DVD player, super crisp and sharp. Enjoy."
5,LOVE IT,"i watch it all the time! best deal ever, i watch it and it has great picture!! best gift idea to myself"
5,exciting,i enjoyed these movies in this series. the story just keeps moving. on a different note your reviews don'y allow me to express what i wish to say. you make me feel like i am i school with a specific words assiginement
5,blu-ray Movies rock,We just bought our 1st blu ray player and this collection was number 1 on on list. All movies looks a million times better in Blu ray. Will never go back to plain dvds.
4,Indiana Jones Review,I found that the new movie Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Was a little over dramatic in some parts. The special effects in the movie were a little to far out there even for Indiana Jones movies.
5,Indiana Jones - The Original Action Hero,"I',ll make this short. Down with the naysayers and movie snobs spouting bad reviews. The first 3 Indiana Jones movies paved the way for many action movies. Indy started it all! So maybe the Crystal Skull was lacking in areas but as a whole this collection is an action/adventure classic not to be missed. It's everything action movies should be.Jeff Ainscough - Denver CO USA"
5,when you want adventure ....it's Indiana Jones in bluray,"i have all the movies in it's various states vhs singles, vhs boxset, vhs boxset widescreen , dvd set and dvd singles ""special edition's.""and yes i will buy the Indiana Jones cloection on bluray also, you can't beat the sound and picture quality of these movies! the lush color and scenery in each film, the action and intrigue , the music by John Williams!!All together this will be one of those film sets that stands alone as one of the best! i hope that the blurays will have all kinds extras on the bonus disc!."
5,Shut up and take my money!,So this is up there with the Star Wars set as THE must own title on Blu Ray ever. Avatar? LOTR?? Earth Girls are Easy??? PAH!!!All the CGI in the Galaxy cannot make a movie this perfect ever again.
4,Great movies,I love these movies. To experience them in blu ray is truly amazing on my Samsung LED TV. 4 stars based on nothing else but how awful the 4th movie is. Not even worthy of being an Indiana jones movie IMO.
5,Dr. Jones in all his glory!,"As probably the biggest Indiana Jones fan on the planet, I highly recommend this Blu-ray collection. Every film looks and sounds amazing, and the book-style casing is beautifully done as well. A must-have."
5,BD quality; lack of some things,"As a follower of some nice sagas, I bought this set expecting some nice things. But... being just 5 discs it lacks some nice extras I'd love to see in HD. Trsut your previous DVD collection for behind the scenes and that sort of things. Don't misinterpret my words. The movies and extras are fine, but I consider it could be a great chance for the producers to give fans all of the stuff Indy has for us."
4,If you haven't seen this series...,...you must be living in a cave! Another adventure movie that tweaks the adventures into something corny. Only for the shear enjoyment of a fantasy movie.
5,The greatest collection of movies ever!,"These movie's are filled with excitement, adventure and a lot of humor and it is sure to keep your attention and the attention of the whole family. I grew up with these movies and my kids will do the same. This is my easiest 5-star film rating ever. The main reason I love all of these movies is because Indy seems like such a normal guy & not some super hero. All of the original Indiana Jones movies have good scripts and you are sure to enjoy these films. One of the things I love most about these films is that they are good for the whole family."
5,great,"This item was just as it was described- I have not watched yet- but will start soon. I have seen the movies before a long time ago. The shipping was quick,"
2,Damaged first disc,"My son-in-law was really looking forward to viewing the Blue-Ray, but when he tried it in the player it would not load. On further inspection, the first disc was scratched. I don't know how to return it for an ""undamaged"" set."
2,Audio is Incompatible,I am sorry to report that these really nice Blue Ray disks do not work with my Surround Sound system. There are six different languages on these disks and five out of six work with my system.The only language track that does not pump out high-quality cricket chirps and every other sound is (you guessed it) English.If you are Surround Sound savvy and can tell me what is wrong here please let me know. Otherwise I'll be watching the English language track through tinny sounding flat-screen speakers.Very disappointed here...
4,3 thumbs up!,"Always when purchasing older movies transfered to blu-ray there is a chance it will not transfer well.Mr Lucas did his homework well.I watched the first flick the day the set arrived.It did not transfer as well as I had hoped,but it did look MUCH better than the original release.Sound is where the biggest stride was made.It rocked the walls in my house...nice indeed.Day two I watched Temple of Doom.The video was much better than Raiders..much more detail showed through.Watching Last Crusade tonight..should be even better as it is a newer flick.I am glad for this purchse...and would do it again"
4,"Great Blu-Ray, Poor Packaging!","I love all the Indiana Jones films and was very excited to see them finally made available on Blu-Ray. The picture quality is really outstanding and it is like being able to watch them all again for the first time! The image is so clear sharp and vibrant. The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is because of the awkward packaging!I have never liked the cardboard sleeve style storage for CD, DVD or Blu-Ray. They are hard to remove without getting greasy finger prints along the outer edges and overtime the disc always end up getting scratch and scuff marks just by removing and replacing them in the snug fitting sleeve. I would have much preferred a box set with an individual blue ray case for each separate disc."
3,"Great movies, HORRIBLE packaging","First off I just want to say FIVE STARS for the movies and the transfers. I would definitely recommend you buy this, but only if you're willing to purchase your own alternative packaging. Here's the story:I cannot tell you how overjoyed I am to finally have this set on bluray. Unfortunately as soon as I opened up the package my joy turned to disappointment. There I saw another of these horrible book-style packages that seem to be popular for high profile sets these days (Alien, Star Wars).These packages hold your discs hostage in there cardboard clutches and WILL kill the hostage. By this I mean it is INCREDIBLY difficult to remove the discs from the book pages and over time will scratch them if you take them out more than a few times. Add to that the fact that these discs feel distinctly flimsier than other blurays I've owned and you have a recipe for disaster."
5,Geat Service,"I was very pleased with this merchandise. It exceeded my expectations on the quality, service and delivery time. This made a great Christmas gift. I will definitely purchase from here again."
4,Excellent product,"Indy looks great on Bluray and the special features are excellent. The packaging is beautiful, but it is rather difficult for me to get the discs out of their sleeves. It's not a big deal; you do have to really man-handle the discs to get them out."
4,Indiana jones,"Bought as a gift. Haven't given to recipient yet, but they will enjoy watching the series on their big screen TV"
4,"Movies we know and love, bad packaging","These are the movies we've come to love for the past couple decades (well, three out of four). I've only seen a couple; I got this so I could watch the others and own them all.However, I was appalled at the quality of the packaging. Cheap feeling slim DVD cases where the inserts don't even fit well; one is cracked, and on another the central button that's meant to keep the disc in place broke off at some point before it was taken from the shrink wrap. At least the movies themselves are worth it."
1,All FOUR Movies? Really? Where?,"I agree that the packaging sucks. My first clue that something was wrong was when I pulled out ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" only to find that it was ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". So I went for the second disc which was supposed to be ""Temple of Doom"". Nope. ""Bonus features"". Third disc? Nope. ""Temple of Doom"". Only two left now. And in the fourth disk which was supposed to be ""Last Crusade"" finally there is ""Raiders"". Any guess what was in the final case which was labeled ""Bonus Features""? Last Crusade? Nope. A SECOND ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". It is bad enough to be forced to buy all four movies when only two are worth watching. It makes it down right insulting then to be shorted one of those two movies. What a ripoff!"
2,Double Dipping....,"I love, love, love the first 3 Indiana Jones films. And I don't really mind the 4th. BUT, I already own Crystal Skull on blu-ray and I refuse to buy it twice. The trend with these Collection releases (LOTR Extended, Jurassic, Star Wars) has been to release them in one collection with no chance to purchase them individually and I'm guessing that this collection will follow that trend. Paramount, I would be delighted to give you my money for the original 3 films, but there is no way in heck that I will you give you my money for a second copy of Crystal Skull.I'm sure that someone is going to come along an criticize me for giving 2 stars to a collection that has yet to be released. However this is not meant as a review of the films (there are thousands of reviews of these films available) rather this is a review of the greedy nature of this release."
1,George Lucas money grab is just too much...no digital copies,"Got it for $61.99 at Costco but arrived home only to notice there's no digital,copies....who sells movies without digital copies these days...already had the fourth movie on blu ray.....so they're going back. George Lucas is just out of touch....if I want to take the movies with me on my IPad I have to buy the entire set on iTunes $120 for both bluray and digital copies just isn't worth it."
1,Where is the Digital Copy???,This product should have had the Digital Copy included in the purchase.I will keep my DVD version. Why bother at this price?
1,Crystyal Skull... GTFOOH! DO NOT BUY THIS WEAK SET,This is a blatant attempt to force us to purchase the Crystal Skull by baiting us with the original trilogy. Don't bite! Just wait it out and they'll release the films individually. Then we can all go back to pretending the piece of crap Crystal Skull does not exist.
1,Ripoff factor!!!,"I know I'm going to get a lot of flack for the one star rating, this maybe the first and last time I object by posting a one star for price and content. Those of you, who are willing to waste your time telling me this is about reviewing the movies, tell me something I don't know. I will not be following this discussion, so save your time and energy with your abject criticisms. The blu-ray transfer will probably be great. The first three movies were spectacular. I agree with anyone who believes in the rip off factor. Give me the first three movies, keep the POS crystal skull and price it so I could buy it for a reasonable $45.00 and I will delete this review and give it 5 stars. If there are more of you who agree, give it one star...moviemakers listened when LOTR was given poor ratings, for what I call the ""rip off factor""!"
5,"Great value, great quality!",I really enjoyed this blu-ray version of the movies. The picture and sound quality surpass what I experienced originally when I saw them in theaters. Thanks Amazon for this great deal!!
5,Wonderful transfers!,I ordered this from the Uk as I much prefer the 'digibook' style packaging of the US version. Beautiful PQ and AQ on all these movies. Raiders looks stunning. The new documentary concerning Raiders is also a real treat. Highly recommended.
5,Indiana Jones : The Complete Adventures (Blue-Ray),The picture and sound quality of this remastered classic series is amazing. You especially notice the difference in the original movie. This four movie set is a must buy for the Indiana Jones fan. You won't be disappointed!
5,Indy at his best,I have never seen Indy look so good before Blu-ray does magical wonders to any film and Indiana Jones is not an exception to that.
3,Glad I got it this edition cheap,I wish this edition came with more special features. The only features on these discs have previously been released on the DVD edition
5,Hubby gift,I can not believe how much better the movies look in Blue Ray...even the sound is better! My husband (and kids) loved it!
4,"Good transfer, with great bonus material.","4 stars because it is not a remastered edition and it includes the horrendous 4th installment. The bonus features are great, especially the behind the scenes footage with later interviews."
4,love Harrison Ford,What can I say any thing with Harrison Ford in it is great andthese movies are great my Husband watches them alot
5,The original,Great movies! I love the entire collection! Not much to say that the quality is great. sound is good and picture quality is good. I watch them all the time.
3,WAIT WAIT WAIT!!!!,"Don't get me wrong - there's nothing wrong with this boxed set.The issue is that there will be a new, more exhaustive and comprehensive box coming in the next six months. It's coming. Don't be fooled!If you must have the new movie now, then just buy the one disc. Wait for the new collection later.That being said - the transfers and quality of the DVD's within are good. The special features are fine. It's complete now with all 4 films, which is nice. But I'm all for having one copy of every movie that I love, and not duplicate my collection by buying something which is bound to be obsolete shortly."
3,Blue Ray,"This was purchases as a gift and the box had small marks, indentations on it. I returned it for another one and the vendor shipped me the exact same one. When I contacted him he told me none he had was in any better shape and if I was that picky I should go to a store and pick it out."
5,One of the Best Adventure Sagas Ever!,"I have to say this first; the 4th film was not bad at ALL!!! If you're a REAL fan, then you know the last Indy is just as good as the first 3. I just wish i knew when this Blu-Ray set was getting released because they have yet to give it one! Come on! If the distributor was smart, they'd know that they would make a ton of money off this because Indiana Jones is one of the best adventure sagas of all time, right behind The Lord of the Rings but ahead of Pirates of the Caribbean & The Mummy. Please, release this already!!!"
5,Very happy,This item was a good buy for all four movies and in excellent shape. They came within the predicted time as well.
2,Indiana Jones trilogy,I am kind of disappointed in this blu ray disc collection. It is good don't get me wrong these films are great but I was really looking for a more in the special features like deleted scenes. This collection was put out by the same people who put together the Star Wars on blu ray collection in which they did an awesome job with the special features with a lot of deleted scenes and other extras so I guess you can say I was kind of expecting the same thing out of the Indiana Jones blu ray collection.
5,"EXCELLENT , EXCELLENT , EXCELLENT",I AM WAITING YEARS FOR THIS TO RELEASE ON BLU-RAY FORMATIT IS A SHAME THEY DID NOT RELEASE IT EARLIER !!!FANTASTIC COLLECTION FOR ALL FAMILY
2,Stop force-feeding me multiple titles,"Between Robert Zemeckis forcing all three Back to the Future movies down my throat in one set and this - I am tired of hostage marketing. I just want the three original titles - and I want them in standard Blu Ray cases, not much to ask. I generally hate ""special"" packaging for these sets. Have any of the a-holes that design this stuff ever tried to put it on their shelves? I am guessing not. I for one am not buying jack until I can get them packaged properly. The same went for Back to the Future and the extended Lord of the Rings movies.I refuse to buy the bulky cardboard crap - and I won't be bullied into buying titles I don't want just because they're shoe-horned in with the ones I want. EPIC FAIL by the studio on this. I just keep watching my standard DVD's until they get it right."
2,Sadly Bad,"Well, there is nothing to say about this movie. It is simply not Indiana Jones. Just a commercial movie to make big bucks. This movie is so different from the other movies of this great franchise. There is no soul, no magic, no adventure, no excitement, no humor, no rational action. To make it short, there is nothing in this movie. I was very disappointed after watching this stupid movie. Indiana Jones is gone forever, that's all... and so should do George Lucas or any people involved in this piece of sh..Sadly really a bad movie! :("
3,There are THREE FILMS!,"There was indeed a movie called Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal skull - but it wasn't actually a real Indiana Jones movie. So, really, what you're getting is the three Indiana Jones films and a fourth film that's non-canonical and more akin to a bad piece of fan fiction."
5,Great movie for the family,"My entire family enjoys watching the Indiana series. I also bought this for my mother for a birthday gift and she loves it too. Great for a popcorn, movie night. Clean entertainment for the whole family"
1,Not my style,"This was a gift intended to be of the Motorcycle Diaries genre. A severe disappointment. Very little music, a lot of deep voice mystical inference. A little too extreme (weird?) if you are expecting music."
5,Beautiful Earrings,These are gorgeous! Very well hand crafted! I bought many different colors of these Novica Collection Butterfly Earrings and they are all beautiful.
1,Amateur DVD,"I enjoy watching sailing DVDs and have seen many. I have been to Tahiti and Bora Bora. I was disappointed in this DVD. The amateur style of filming, the lack of focus on any one topic for any length of time and the shortness of the film (25 minutes) was a disappointment for the price.The producer could not possibly have covered five major islands in 25 minutes and leave the viewer satisfied.Save your money."
5,Fascinating book to read,"Nibley compares modern Christianity with findings from the Dead Sea Scrolls and proves that second to none, the LDS Church is the keeper of the ancient philosophies, rites, and beliefs. It becomes also apparent that ancient science knew a lot more than is currently believed. Modern physics is only now unearthing some facts that the ancients knew (as demonstrated in the Scrolls) about the universe, its size, its underlying laws, etc."
3,A mixed bag,"The book is a collection of writings, lectures, and addresses by Hugh Nibley. Many of them relate to the Dead Sea Scrolls. About half of the chapters in the book are quite interesting and worth reading. The other half dawdle on about arcane languages and mythologies that have only limited appeal (that is, they will only appeal to a specific audience)."
2,"OKay, cheap little paperback","Okay, but if you are looking for a book that you would like to keep around and refer back to I would not recommend this version. But, is a great little book."
1,Avoid this printing,"I have this book in hardback (bought 30 years ago and it is the best translation) and wanted to get one for my son, but as I couldn't find anything but paperback I ordered this one. Big disappointment. The paper is cheap and coarse, the lettering is thick and indistinct, and there are no margins. Its visually difficult and unpleasant to read. This is published by the ""Signet Press"", I will be avoiding their books in the future."
5,Great,"I got the book really fast, and it was in GREAT condition, nice doing business with you. If this book is a reflection of all your other items i would buy from you 100% of the time."
3,Good book but poor quality of print and paper,"The book is undoubtedly good. It gives a good overview of the Gita and discusses the principles of Hinduism in simple language. I was only disappointed on the quality of paper and print. Barnes & Noble has a good hardcover option on this book, which is a good buy."
5,Exactly what I needed,"When I first received my package, I was a bit disappointed that I didn't get a needle though the product description clearly states that one came with it. Then my disappointment turned into joy when I realized that written on a little orange sticker on the top of the pump stated that the needle was under the little rubber cap which was under the orange sticker.I attached the hose and the needle and within 2 minutes had the basketball, football, and soccer ball for my son's sports climber inflated and ready to go! Now I wish I had more things to inflate!"
5,Great Product,Several months now in use and now problems. The handle stores and extra needle which is sweat. Great product over all.
5,This is really good! It is just the thing I want.,"In the right size, and it is useful! It is just the thing I want. At first, I did not find the needle. Actually, it is just in the cap."
1,Broken upon arrival,This product was broken at the base of the handle upon arrival at my doorstep. It's quite unfortunate because otherwise it probably would've received a 4 or 5 star.
1,No Needle,Add me to the list of people who did not receive a needle. Pump seems to work fine but very frustrating to have the actual product not match the picture - at present it's useless.
4,Good pump,"Good pump, good price (at the time I bought about $5). The needle stores inside the pump, which is nice. The little hose does not and I wish it did."
4,"Twice the air, half the pumps","I have owned several pumps over my life and this is the first pump that does dual inflation. The air goes in as you push AND pull the handle in & out of the pump, inflation time takes half the time and only requires about 30 seconds to inflate a deflated basketball."
4,Great pump!,"Right out of the package this pump feels durable. Like many other complaints, this pump shows 3 pieces, but only came with two (missing needle). I had spare needles but can understand the other customers' frustration with having to go out just to purchase a needle. Overall, this pump seems like it will last for years to come."
1,Needle broke the first time I used it!,"This is poorly manufactured. When I used it for the first time on a basketball, the needle broke off from the pump. I did not put any extra pressure. I'll go with a name brand as a replacement."
5,Very handy,"This is such a nifty must have to any soccer mama! The handy needly storage area in the cap makes for easy storage and an easy way to keep track of it! It inflates very quickly despite it's small size! I coordinated 2 age groups for the soccer club, and this has been a dream to make sure all 48 balls were correctly inflated before being handed to the coaches. Did not take long at all either!"
3,Doesn't come with needle - make sure you order some...,"Pump itself seems fine but it didn't come with needles. Luckily, I ordered a separate pack of them. Also, shipped from Amazon covered in some thick, black grease (!?!) which I got all over my shirt and which forced me to throw away the plastic pouch it came in. In all, not a good experience."
1,"Missing the needle, can't use it","Even though the product description says it comes with the needle, mine didn't.HUGE amazon fan right here, but this is an annoying experience. I can't get it replaced because amazon doesn't consider it their fault. Now I have to drive 20 min to a sporting good store to buy a needle. Not really worth the trouble but not worth it to pay to send this back to amazon either.Annoying customer experience..."
3,Keeping your Equipment Inflated,Finally received item. Was very unhappy with the length of time it took to deliver.
2,Doesn't really teach,"If are interested in actually learning steps, I found this tape almost useless. The whole thing seems hurried and it doesn't really teach well. Probably the worst tape I've seen for that. I would see one use for this tape: after you've become an intermediate level dancer, this tape may give you some ideas on how to dance properly, to ""flow."" The instructors are obviously very skilled and professional."
1,Simply Incomprehensible!,"The author of this book may be a great logician, but he compunicates his ideas extremely badly, making this book agonisingly difficult to read.The author is clearly not a native English speaker, and avoids explaining any concepts in depth, instead using page after page of Prolog code to demonstrate principles.This tiny book really isn't worth the paper its printed on."
5,All time favorite,Purchased this because I needed to refresh my typing skills. This the easiest and most fun and fastest teaching typing tutor material that you can buy for a great price.
4,Great waistbag from Kipling,"Product is great in terms of quality and functionalities. However, if it is bigger then will be fantastic and idea!"
1,Failed after one use,"Failed after one use. I don't want a replacement if it's that unreliable! Hmm the rating system won't take zero (or negative) stars, too bad."
1,Did not Work,"This device did not ""plug and play"" in my up-do-date, Windows XP computer. When I plugged it in it asked if I wanted to ""format"" the drive. I declined and downloaded my pictures directly from the camera. I then chose to ""format"". It was unsuccessful and wrecked my CF card. I had no problems with a reader from Kingston that cost a bit more."
5,A sweet story of unexpected love,"This is a marvelous sweet story! Pippa finds unexpected love in a man she always called ""brother,"" but then she has to convince him that she really loves him and not his rival! Delightful writing and character building. I'd recommend Elisabeth Mansfield to anyone :)"
2,review,"I got the package after 9 days of placing order,they charged me 14 dollars for the postage,and 29 dollars for the package,decent size bag fits 2 lenses and a camera body,front pouch will fit the charger,and the tripod stand,its a cheap buy ,but the quality is not the greatest,the tropod looks very flimsy and bag looks cheap but well paded and secure,not lockable,for another extra 5 dollars including postage there is another similar pack available with a good quality tripod and a nikon bag,and a lens cleaning kit,i think this package is not worth the money i am thinking of returning it but just caluculating the postage,learnt a good lesson but with a cost,dont fall in the same ditch like i did,having spent so much for the camera dont compromise another 10-15 dollars falling prey for this deal."
1,No way would he have done this abomination,"This is terrible music, if you can call it that.Yes, perfectly performed but unfortunately there is no soul and nothing of the spirit that Jaco had.And even though I love Richard Bona he butchered Blackbird.Don't buy it if you're into music!"
5,school book,This is required reading for a college class. I have just started reading and find the writing technical but understandable. Book was as promised and in good condition.
5,These are great boxes!!!,"I have 6 of these boxes, one for each lake or type of fishing, one that I keep in the car trunk etc. They're easy to open/close and stay closed. See-thru so you know what's in there before you open it. Roomy enough to carry tools, leader, other small boxes of tackle, etc. I used to lug one huge tackle box around, but no more of that! And for the price, these boxes are a great deal!"
4,Lots of great history and some interesting general info,"I like the way this book was set up. It's easy to read with little ""quizes"" all the way through. It's got great info on the origin of kata (names and creator), information on japanese martial arts terminology, and some interesting ""general martial arts knowledge"" info. For example, they say that a well executed martial arts punch can generate 600 foot/pounds of pressure and that bone has a structural strength greater than that of concrete. Are these stats true? I'm not sure, but it makes for an interesting read."
2,shorin-ryu,"The book came to me with pages missing. I wrote a letter to the sender and tryed to e-mail them asking for a replacement book, but on answer."
3,A great Read !,"It took me a while to purchase this book. But once I got it, I have no regrets whatsoever. Its informative and eye-pleasing to read. Mr. Scaglione and Mr. Cummings really did a great a job. In fact I recomended this book to several of my students.Prince LoefflerShugyokan Shorin Ryu Dojowww.alljapankarate.com"
2,Beware of shorter video versions!,"The original PBS aired version (and original VHS release) runs 115 minutes. Later video releases cut it to 54 minutes and are awful - half the movie is gone, making it a real mess to watch. Check the running time BEFORE buying a video version -- if it's not 115 minutes, pass!Hopefully all of Peter Hunt's wonderful Mark Twain adaptations will be put out on DVD complete and uncut."
2,Poor quality,"Life on the Mississippi was a gift for my husband, who loves the story. The disappointment was in the quality of the tape and not the story/movie. We could hardly understand the words due to scratchy/poor quality. We are returning it for a refund...and NO it wasn't a used tape - it was new."
3,"Attractive Production, Musically Sound, but on shallow side.","Production has attractive cast, especially Miah Persson & Isabel Leonard ( who made spectacular debut in Romeo & Juliette w/the Tourterelle Aria). Persson is trully an accomplished Soprano & Leonard while not as accomplished is headed for a brilliant Opera career.Bo Skovhus occupied too much space as Don Alfonso and I think he upset overall balance of Opera. Also the modern aspect of the production took away from the Pathos which is always my favorite part of a Mozart Opera.This gave the production a shallow feeling.I much prefer the Drottningholm 1984 production DVD. But this production is worth buying and is fun in its way."
4,Perfect for time pressed singles,"This is a great cookbook for singles who are pressed for time. I also like the fact that the recipes feature easy to find ingredients (if you don't have a lot of time to cook, you probably don't have much time to scour specialty markets either). My favorites are the recipes for sausage/lentil soup and ground beef mix. The only reason that I am not giving this five stars is the lack of color photos. Otherwise, it's a great book."
4,Not a bad cook book!,This is a pretty good cookbook if you are living in an apartment with a small kitchen and need to prepare for small meals. It covers simple dishes and the receipes are well written. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the illustration of the book is a bit poor (ie. no color pictures) inside.
3,Good for beginners,"I had gotten this book form my grandmother after I moved-out on my own and thought it was pretty good for my beginning cooking skills. Now, 21 years later, and after re-purchasing it after it was lost in a move, it is too basic for my much-improved cooking skills. The recipes are good and easy to do but they probably won't do much for someone with cooking experience. For the beginner, a son/daughter who has just moved-out or maybe even as a wedding present for a couple who now have to cook for each other without much experience in doing so, this would be a good gift."
5,World's greatest book.,"I am the author's daughter and I think this is a wonderful book. It inspired me so much I wrote a song about Don Roberts, the co-author. Go out and buy the book. Dad will be happy and I will get another American Girl!"
2,"Good start, but lacking details","This book would be a good resource for anyone that's a well-experienced ArcGIS user. There is a lot of theory and general concepts, but much of the detail has been left out. Actual real world examples are very limited. I'd recommend using the tools in ArcGIS Spatial Analyst and it's related help information over this book."
2,Don't bother....,"This book is like many other GIS books: a compilation of case studies. There are no details, techniques, or tutorials provided. The text is accompanied by a CD, but everything on the CD can be downloaded for free from the internet.This book was required for a class I took and I never even opened it. Unless you've been studying GIS for 15 years and have somehow NEVER delved into water resource applications, don't waste your money. It's a bunch of theory and conceptual jibber jabber."
4,ArcHydro,The book was about 5 years old which for software is a bit old but I was able to use it. Thanks
3,A fun play thingy,"I am 11 years old and the only problems I have will this toy that is that it always fall apart!!!!!!!!!! I always have to re-attach doors and the trunk, and the mirrors. I still love the toy! I hope you love my review!"
2,Cute but not durable!!!,"We bought this jeep for our 2 1/2 year old daughter for christmas last year. we got home from the store and started to put it together. EVERYTHING kept falling apart. Now I know that it is a jeep and the doors are supposed to come off and so does the roof, but this thing is a joke. The canopy on top is so tight that the roof won't even stay snaped on. and the windshield won't stay up if the roof won't stay put. so basically you have to play with it with the roof completly off and the windshield down to get any fun. I thought it would be great, our daughter could put 4 bratz in it and take them for a ride. Oh ya and they tell you that it fit's 5 bratz, ya one in the very front of that jeep that is a jumper seat and the bratz doll barley fit's in it. We took it back and bouhgt her the Bratz car instead and she LOVES it!!!!!!!!"
2,Bratz safari jeep falls apart constantly,"My daughter (9 years) received this as a gift. She was so excited until she played with it for about 30 minutes. She was in tears and very frustrated because it literally kept falling apart. The top of the jeep and the doors would not stay on. She also complained that the seats fall out. It looks good as long as you do not touch it. In her words: ""This is made stupid!"""
1,Was very disappointed!!,I bought the Bratz Wild Life Safari Cruiser for my daughter for Christmas. It will be going back to the store. Everything on this jeep comes off everytime she plays with it. The front seats don't lock into place and the dolls can't sit up straight. Some of the items are suppose to come on and off but when you put them back on they don't stay on. My daughter was excited when she saw it but after she played with it for 15 minutes and realized how cheaply it is made she hasn't played with it since. Would recommend no one purchase this toy.
5,thule rack systems rule,thule 871 is a great fit for the 07 toyota FJ. fits great between OEM roof roack and reduces wind noise while underway greatly. solid product. i always use thule.
4,Exactly what we needed!,A pain in the rear to put together. Holes didnt line up. But then again do they ever do on assemble yourself furniture? Other wise great product for the price.
3,does the job,"Not ugly, not too cheaply made, not too hard to put together, and it just happen to match my kitchen table and chairs"
2,Book Review,The book that i recieved was not the correct book and I put in the isbn number so I think it would be good if you put a picture of all the books you are selling so people can see before they buy it. What am I going to do now with the wrong book?
3,complicated ideas crammed into a few lines,I had a limited interest in this book. I found much more information inThe Making of the English Working Class. I really wanted to see how much George Eliot had been hurt by seeing society wiped out by the wealthy. Middlemarch is the novel which expresses most of the forms of retribution that are mentioned in this book on the topic: revenge. War and youth were also topics at the end of the book that showed what a thinker can do.
1,well,well i didn't recieve this item because it is no longer made......so had to order another media card and thank goodness it got here before christmas.
1,Horrible track; such a disappointment.....,"My brother bought this for my 5 yr old son. It took nearly an hour to put together; once it was together is was SO COOL! For about 5 minutes until the batteries ran out! It comes with a rechargable car that lasts on the track for literally 3 minutes, then dies, Then you have to wait 10 minutes for it to recharge. A big disappointment for a 5 yr old."
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"Gave this to my 4 year old son for Christmas and we are sooo disappointed with it. From the look of the box, it really looks cool, but on Christmas morning this was by far the worst toy he got. He was able to ""play"" with it only after the 45 minutes assembly that was required since it comes in about 45 pieces! Really the car by itself would have been just as fun to my boys. To make matters worse you have to TAPE it to the floor in order for it to work!!! And before the children can race the cars they have to wait for the car to charge each time, which takes up to a minute! Really it needs 2 cars so one can be charging while they race the other, which you have to buy separetly because only 1 car comes with it. And for children that's a long time to wait! Overall, if I can cram all those pieces back in the box it's going back to the toy store."
1,Big Disappointment,"Our five year old has wanted this for months. He was so excited he knew he was getting one for Christmas. After I assembled on Christmas eve, I was disappointed and knew he would be. The next morning he was so excited. Which changed quickly after playing with this item. He asked if he could take it back and thats what we will do. The cars (We bought extra cars) are slow and only run for a few laps."
2,We were disappointed,"I've got a mixed review but overall it is a disappointing toy. My husband bought this for my son's 6th birthday and it looked pretty cool. It was complicated to assemble it the first time and took over 30 minutes. When the kids got to playing with it they had lots of fun. Charging the car only took a minute or so...they didn't seem to mind a bit. After a few weeks we put it away. When we got it back out a few months later I actually got it put together without the directions (!) BUT the car didn't work at all. Replacing the batteries didn't fix it, so now we have a track and no car. I'm not too excited about buying a replacement car if it only works for a week or two. So if you want a toy that may not work the second time you get it out, go for this one."
4,backstreet boys on the road,"I did enjoy this book, but I thought that it was sketchy in places and left you wondering if it was true. I do love the boys so I think that anything that shows thier characters is cool. I think that I would reccomend this book"
5,Poussin's Secret+Genesis,"Dear Sir !Congratulations !Great books !But !I.m missing theexplanation for the content of Foquet abbé:""...so difficult to discover that nothing now onthis earth can prove of better fortune nor be theirequel..""Nevertheless it is questionig to me,why Posussininformed Foquet so easily-if this is so secret ?Furthermore I doubt about the fact,how could Poussinundertood all these really difficult mathematics inthis century-if it makes difficulties to me as well in2001 ?...and what is meaning:""nothing better fortune"" ???Just the mathematic rules and ????I.m absolutely sure there should be more than thisand I think there should be any link,how rapidlySauniere became rich ?!These are currently my doubts and questions to you.With best regards:Zoltan SzilagyiBudapest/Hungary"
2,Not much Dylan,"The drummer for Dylan is a trip. But I guess because of licensing, you won't see or hear Dylan much. Nice perspective from a drummer who wanted to play the tunes the way he had learned them off the albums. Dylan of course wants to play them differently each time he performs them. The drummer is now in a Dylan cover band where he can play the tunes the way they were on the albums."
5,The JG's Are Awesome!,"I thoroughly enjoyed Slim Lambright's riveting debut. The characters were intriguing and richly drawn, the setting was realistic, and the storyline had a full circle effect that left me satisfied.I look forward to reading subsequent works by ""Slim."""
2,Bouncing Balls - No Structure,"There were certain scenes that were good, like the scene with the gay guy and and the JG that was molested by her old behind cousin whose wife was deathly sick. This book, with a seasoned author, could have been written around that story in its own. There were just too many stories/sub-plots and people in this book until it is very confusing. The stories jump and bounce around all of the time. You forget who's who. It could have been a better novel had the story been told in a more structured manner with less characters."
4,Good Read,i liked this one. this book was entertaining and should be on every book shelf. The book started off a little slow but picked up by chapter three. Although it was and enjoyable read and it captured the essence of true friendship of the four girls. I very pleased with the book and it ending.
3,ok,"The Justus girls is about four girls who were best friends, who started a singing group called the Justus girls. Three of the girls meet again, when one of the former member,Peaches is killed. A great story of friends being there for one another."
5,"Great, Great,Great....","Great book, good read. I loved this story, it had all of the components needed for a good read. I like the way the author played out each character and their life story and how it all became a full circle in the end. I especially liked Rasheeda and Danny... Great story with alot of substance to keep one interested and thirsty until the end. you did a great job ""Slim""..."
3,ENJOYABLE READING,I ALSO ENJOY READING Jonathan Kirsch' BOOKS. I ASK HIM TO PLEASE WRITE MORE. THERE ARE MANY A STORIES IN THE BIBLE JUST WAITING FOR HIM AND I TOO AM WAITING FOR ANOTHER GREAT READ!!THANK YOU MR. KIRSCH!
2,Informative for the Uninformed...Maybe,"Kirsch's revelation (sic) that Judaism has a long history of diversity and myriad interpretations is old news by roughly 3500 years [Note to Jonathan: that is the definition of Midrash in the first place.] Repetitive exclamations! that biblical writers tried to conceal, whitewash, or censor this or that bit of information are presented in a tabloid style as often as not citing sloppy research or questionable scholarship. Newcomers to biblical inquiry may pick up a few nuggets of basic information here, but for my money Mr. Kirsh would be well advised to pay more attention to his serious subject than to selling books to supplement his income."
1,Pathetic,"The entire book comes directly from the VS.NET online documentation. Though this is disappointing, what makes the book an embarassment is the poor editing. The authors' attempt to condense the material renders much of it inadequate for explaining the concept at hand. Many, many topics feel incomplete, as if little thought went into the editing process. Important explanations (from the online doc) are excised. Others are sloppily paraphrased. I've had to constantly refer elsewhere for clarification. I wish I would have simply studied the online documentation, using the exam requirements as a guideline. This book is a waste of time."
1,Incomplete Information,"The Good:Frist chapter on Windows Service has been explained very well with adequate examples. Writer knew his stuff. You don't need any supplementary sources for windows serviceThe Bad:All the chapters other than the first one are terrible. Incomplete information. The chapter on remoting is a total chaos, it will leave big holes in your understanding. I had to read through MSDN and other books to really learn the materials. It was waste of money, but more valuably waste of my time."
2,Who edits these books?,"While I have not found many technical errors with this book, I am left wondering if Microsoft actually reads their own study guides. This book flows about as well as a bad high school term paper. The wording is very awkward and the author doesn't seem to have a college-level command of the English language.For example, one passage in the first chapter reads: ""The managed execution process involves managed code and managed data. Managed code is self-describing code that provides information for the common language runtime for providing various run-time services.""Is this correct? Yes. Is it well written - NO! If nothing else the use of a thesaurus would have made the book much more readable. Until more study guides appear on the market we are stuck with mediocre tomes like this. I am reminded of the old adage about one million monkeys with one million typewriters..."
1,Very Poorly Written,"Judging by the positive reviews, this book must have some merit but it is certainly not in the quality of its writing or its accuracy. Perhaps the editor was reassigned to Longhorn duties. Here are some examples of what you can expect in the first two chapters:""A COM+ component exists in three states: exists and activated, exists and not activated, and nonexistent.""""The pool objects are not destroyed even after their release from the client application. COM+ retains the destroyed object in the pool for recycling..."""" If the value of the CanStop property is set to False, the SCM does not pass the Stop command to the service application.""It's main value to me is as a syllabus. You can use it to direct your search for better explanations on MSDN and, of course, everyone should have Troelsen's ""C# and the .NET Platform"" which is the best textbook I have read. Ever."
3,Not enough for passing!,"It's a good reference but not enough for passing!I think MSDN palys a great role (90%) if you really want to pass the exam.You need at lease 1 year experience with VS.NET,.NET and last but not least XML/XSL/Schema.Learn as much as you can regarding Remoting, COM, COM+ and transactions.I passed the test a week ago :)Good Luck"
3,"LONG AGO, IN AN ARENA OF BLOOD AND TEARS...","THIS BOOK CONCERNING RODDY PIPER, COMES FROM THE OLD SCHOOL OF WRESTLING. RAW, AND IN YOUR FACE. PIPER REMAINS, ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF PRO WRESTLING, FROM AN AGE WHERE BLOOD FLOWED FOR TRUE, AND TEARS FOLLOWED THE GRAPPLER TOWN TO TOWN....A RARE FIND----IF YA FIND IT! FAR AHEAD OF IT'S DAY...PIPER IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ICONS IN THE HISTORY OF WRESTLING. PERIOD!"
1,No!,"First of all, this is not really a Christmas book. Yes, they have a Christmas tree, presents, and Swedish cookies in the last chapter. (Ok, the tree does show up a little earlier.) But one chapter does not a Christmas story make! Second, the bad guy is just too bad, being a demented, abusive murderer, while the good guys, frankly, are just not good enough. To me this story also seemed short on emotion between the leading couple. And the multiplicity of subplots leaves you feeling that nothing's ever been fully developed. So many things are just hinted at or skimmed over that this gets to be a frustrating book."
1,OK Book,If your a hardcore Rush fan (God help you) this is the book for you- if your just an average listener- I'd skip it.
1,Instant Regret,"Where to begin... Summer of 2003 listening to a lot of new surf music and discovering all of the great albums out there. Then I buy this album... I'm lucky it didn't turn me off of music. It sounds like it was recorded in a tin can, the playing is sloppy and very loose, and the songwriting lacks anything resembling imagination or emotion. Definitely a disc to skip. This is the only review I've ever written on Amazon and certain the only bad review I've ever written on the internet. Skip or you will hate yourself."
5,Amazing! Wow!,"This stuff rocks! I have tried countless self tanners and finally I have found one that does NOT stink and gives a great tan! My girlfriend commented last night..""so, I see someone decided to go to the tanning bed after all!"" I replied, ""nope! from a bottle!"" She was speechless. When I hit 30 a few years (ahem! ;0) ) ago, I decided I wanted to continue looking young so I decided to stop trying to get a tan and just go fake and load on the sunscreen (50-60 spf). I'm happy to say that I look 10 yrs younger than my actual age, if not more! This stuff is easy to apply, no raunchy stench, and does not feel sticky after it has dried...what could be better! Go get some of this!!"
5,"War Slang, OUTSTANDING BOOK!","I have the first edition and this book like the first one is not only humorous to read, it helps you understand how certain phrases evolved and during which conflict. Active duty, guard, reserve, retired...all comers, this is a book you will not be disappointed in owning."
2,"O.K., If you know the core material","The book is not great, but it's the only one I used to study for the exam and I passed. I thought it did an adequate job with the project assessment aspects of this exam - identifying and prioritizing problems and goals. It does a poor job of covering CIDR IP addressing, however. For this test though, you must have mastered the material in 216 and 217. My field experience helped me quite a bit, but was not a must for this test. I don't work with international WANs for example, but there are international scenarios in the exam. And there's no substitute for exam prep like one of the many test engines available."
2,I've read worse,"Not the worst New Riders book I've read, but definitely not the best.The information is there. Ok, not in the best format, but like all exams you should be using 2 or 3 sources of info and obviously get some experiance on the subject.I would have marked it a bit higher if New Riders would publish errata for their books. Since there are always errors that slip through the proofing proccess."
1,Not good,"The sizing on these are way off. The ""large"" was so long, they almost looked like a dress on my son. I ordered a total of 10 shirts in different colors, and they were all the same. The sizing looked more like an XXL rather than L. Also, the shirts aren't colorfast. The dye from the blue shirts bled on to my other clothes in the wash."
1,Not very helpful,"Ovrely simplafied, noty very helopfull, cannot recomend it, but if you want to buy my used copy cheap, I'd sell it to you."
3,How To Rebuild Your Big Block Chevy,"This book was quite informative to those of us who have never rebuilt a big block. I have several small block's under my belt, but no big blocks, thus my need for written guidance. The only negative I found was there could have been more part to part comparisons, i.e., starters, fuel pumps, air cleaners, carbs, etc.. The book was very detailed save the items I just mentioned. If you must tackle a Big block I strongly recommend this book."
3,typical mid-range occult horror,"I've read worse, but it could be a lot better. For example, early on the reader gets glimpses of Alana's overall plan but the details are never actually explained. The romance between Alana and Luther is entirely gratuitous and painfully predictable. Most of the characters are far too convenient and the 'throwaway' Malina's two-dimensionalness is not excused by her swift demise. I think the Irish should feel insulted by this schmalzy glamourisation of their pagan history."
3,Ungrateful Dead,"Although UNGRATEFUL DEAD is not one of Holleman's better efforts, it can be an entertaining read. His characters are identifiably good and evil, with a simple, straightforward plotline that moves from point A to point B with little digression."
5,"Fast, Solid, & Easy","This is my sixth digital camera over the past five years. Although I use a professional digital camera for special events, I wanted a pocket size camera for convenience.It' fast! Let me tell you - the autofocus speed is faster than most other point and shoot cameras. It also displays photos without delay. Turn it on - the lens is ready in less than a second!It's solid. The body is all metal. The LCD and the optics are recessed (protected). It's easy to hold.It's easy. The controls are minimal and smartly laid out. No fancy bells and whistles.The image quality is surprising. Exposure and color are accurate. Pictures are sharp and clear.Is it the ultimate digital camera? No. Is it the best pocket sized digital camera? For under $350, I think it is."
2,"Noisy, noisy, noisy","Loads of great features but takes some of the worst pictures of any camera I have ever seen. It's almost as if Casio put in an ""Add Noise to Picture"" feature. If there is a great deal of light the pictures are okay (but mediocre compared to most other 4 MP cameras), but in anything less then the absolute best conditions it is completely subpar. It will be a long time before I purchase another Casio camera."
2,Yuk -- I'm Returning It,"Just bought this at COSTCO for Christmas, after not being able to get the one that I wanted (an Exilim in the right price range). I am definitely bringing it back. It burns up batteries like NOBODY's business -- I'm on my third set of AA batteries in three days and I've taken fewer than 15 pictures! My camera is stupidly preset to the ""movie"" mode so it starts taking movies when you want to shoot snapshots; and every time you replace the batteries you have to reset this setting or it does it again. I just tried to take a photo of some mold damage in our apt., and the crappy Logitech I had (1 MP) did better, because this one tried to adjust too many things in the picture and lost the contrast. No thanks -- this might be a good camera for somebody, but I'm not impressed. I want a slim one that's NOT a total battery hog -- and at least not AA batteries! Yak..."
3,Average.....at best!,"Pros:1)Takes great pictures outside and in situations with alot of light.2)Pictures taken with flash look good, although more ""white"" than realistic.3)Looks really cool.4)Compact.5)Very sturdy.6)Easy to use.Cons:1)Any pictures not using the flash or in high light situations (sunlight, etc) turn out blurry and are pretty poor.2)The flash takes FOREVER to recharge. Approximately 7 (SEVEN!!!) seconds for the flash to recharge. This is what really kills it for me. I have a 1 year old and want to take pictures quickly, 3 seconds or less charge time like my old Kodak CX4300, a $129 camera!"
4,Great camera for the money.,"I bought this camera a few days ago. I love it. I have been shopping extensively for a camera and finally settled. It takes great pictures, has a fast startup time, very easy to use. One major selling point for me was the size. It fits right into my pocket no problem. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because it is a little heavy for its size, plus it doesn't have a video mode. Other than that not a single complaint."
4,Great Value,I think it takes great pictures in optimal conditions. Outside on sunny days produce excellent color and resolution. I have found that pictures at night or of fast moving things don't turn out well. The shutter lag time is also noticable. It is hard to take pictures of pets unless they sit still which is often unlikely.
2,"Sleek design, poor performance","I bought this camera because it has an extremeley attractive design, it seemed a good value for the money ($250) and the package included NiMH batteries, charger, 32MB memory card and 10MB internal memory. I was very disappointed when I saw the pictures on my computer. Even at maximum resolution in &amp;quot;fine&amp;quot; mode the pictures seemed hazy and some of them had double edges. I took many pictures in dim light and they did not turn O.K. as the other customer stated. I returned the camera to the store."
1,Product does not match picture.,"The guage that I was sent is marked as ""Tachikara Ball Pressure Guage"", but it is very different from the picture shown on the webpage. It only goes up to 15 psi, as opposed to the 20 psi shown in the picture."
5,Excellent,This product does what it is suppose to do. I am a volleyball official & use it @ every match. Best part is if ball has to much air it is easy to release it.
5,Outstanding!,"This is a really great product. Allows one to get an exact pressure on your sports ball. You overinflate a little with a separate pump, push in this guage for a reading, then without removing the guage the pressure release valve allows you to let air out until the desired pressure is achieved. Works really well."
4,Nice and accurate,"I wish it was more precise, I'm not sure what balls are inflated to 20 PSI, so I think it should have gone to 15. Its still able to read 3.5 PSI but if I want a ball between 3.26 psi and 3.63 PSI, you can only get an estimate. It does have a valve to release air to lower the PSI which is nice."
4,Sports Ball Air Guage,This worked as expected. The display was easy to read and accurate. The instructions were clear and easy to understand.
5,Tachikara Ball Pressure Gauge,"This gauge works perfectly. Very simple to use, just insert into ball inflation hole and it reads the ball pressure. You can decrease the pressure by the press of a botton on the side of the gauge. If you need a ball pressure gauge, this is it."
1,Item is not the same as the picture,"My gauge arrived with a cracked face (packaging was bad) and was not even the item pictured. To see the actual item, go to the Tachikara website and search for ball gauges. After some investigation (not extensive) it seems that this is a picture of an older, non-existent model. I didn't pay alot for the gauge and the quality was fine for the price, it's just not what I ordered. Amazon was great regarding the return of a damaged item, so it won't affect my ordering in the future, it was just disappointing."
2,2 gauges...which will you get?,"I ordered this gauge based on the primary picture which shows a blue gauge going to 20 psi, with the pressure relief button on the left as you view the gauge face. The one I received is black, goes to 15 psi with the release button on the right. The release button is plastic and the gauge overall looks like the cheap cousin of the one in the primary picture. I would not have purchased this gauge if I had know which one I was getting. But not worth the trouble to return."
3,"works, but quality is cheap","This works well, but it doesn't match the amazon picture. It's made of inexpensive plastic, even the pressure outlet isn't brass like the picture shows. It's a cheap plastic button. Aside from that, it works well. And since I don't check ball pressure every day, more like once every couple of weeks, this should work out fine."
5,A nice surprise...,"I was pleasantly surprised by the accuracy and ease of use with this Tach Pressure Gauge. I bought a second one for my local YMCA, since their v-balls were consistently inconsistent. The bleed valve is a key and functions perfectly. Overall I was impressed, but hope to find an ""all in one"" pump/gauge solution."
1,Cheap plastic junk,"The gauge came broken in the package. Upon inspection, the gauge is just a cheap plastic instrument that is way overpriced. Where the break occur is a design flaw that would result in another one breaking in the same manner. I had no desire to exchange the gauge; I just requested my money back."
5,Pressure Gauge,The pressure gauge came as described and in a timely fashion . I was pleased with the seller with promptness of delivery
2,"Only an USB cradle, no power supply.","This cradle is designed very simply (as a previuos reviewer said.), perhaps not deserving $30. However, for such an expensive and simply designed cradle, Sony does not even give the customer power supply function from USB port. So, if you are on travel, you need to bring another clumsy power adapter.However, Belkin provided a type of USB Sync and charger which has the fuction to charge your PDA from the USB ports. After I saw this Belkin product, I bought one promptly.After I got the Belkin USB Syn and Charger, the Sony USB is sleeping in my drawer now, Collecting Dust."
4,always with me,"I use this knife as my money clip and while in perfect world I 'd rather have the clip a bit closer to the top of the knife (when closed), having a razor-sharp knife with me at all times has proved indispensable. Well made and sized perfectly (for a money clip)."
5,Perfect for what I wanted it for...,I bought this to use it on my key chain as a pocket suspension clip. It works great for that. The big hole at the bottom works perfect for attaching it to a key ring. It suspends my keys in my pocket so they don't bunch and tangle up in the bottom of my pocket. The added benefit is that I have a nice compact sharp knife always with me on my key chain now.
4,sharp,"self honing so duh, but the rear corner of the blade irritated my hand. some emory board took care of it"
5,It's tiny!,"I have never had more people ask about a knife and want to look at it, it is very different looking, some call it scary, because of the external blade style, I have purchased these for gifts, I like it a lot and use it a lot!"
2,Columbia River Knife,Columbia River Knife did not retain a sharp edge. It dulled very quickly in cutting plastic fasteners.
5,A Classic Agatha Christie Suspense Thriller!!,"In this 1947 TV remake""Love From A Stranger""Ceciley Harrington(Sylvia Sydney)wins big in a sweepstakes where she meets a handsome stranger Manuel Cortez(John Hodiak) and is mesmerized and falls in love with him with murder on his mind.It's a classic Agatha Christie suspense thriller!!"
3,"Perfect fit, but quality does not match OEM",The reason that I am giving it 3 stars is due to the quality. The filter does perfectly match my lexus rx350 but the quality is so inferior that I had to take off at least 2 stars. I had read that the factory filter was made by Denso so I had high expectations. But the quality of the filter is very different from the OEM filter. The factory filter is backed by a plastic netting where the replacement model is a very very flimsy filter. As I stated it was a replacement for a lexus filter...before you purchase I would check your filter out to look at the quality. It is possible that a toyota or other model may have a different quality. If it does not have a fine plastic netting on the back you may be ok with it...if not I do not believe it is worth the cost.
2,Maja Liquid Soap,The soap leaked out despenser making product not useful for gift giving. Very disapointed with the packageing of this product.
4,Savannah Futon,"Lots of assembly, but not difficult. All the parts were there and the instructions were adequate. Actually, really decent quality for the price: solid wood as advertised, though poplar I wouldn't technically classify as a hardwood; it's more like pine with a greenish hue. Pretty, though. Claims that uit comes pre-sanded, but it needs a finish sanding before staining/painting. Works great, no complaints."
4,Very nice. Easy assembly,"I bought this months ago, and just got around to putting it together yesterday. It was very easy to put together. (It took me about an hour by myself with only the hex wrench they supply.) I choose not to stain it, and it looks very nice. It is much better quality than those metal frame ones from a popular big box retailer."
5,Wonderful!,"I bought this book several years ago and I have yet to put it down. I still turn to it for some inspiration or a papery shoulder to cry on. The poems contained herein are not only relevant but honestly and beautifully written. Very easy to read and immensely entertaining. I laughed, I cried, and learned to respect lawn ornaments. :D I loved it!"
4,Big Band Earl,"Not a bad compilation from Hines' big band,this CD contains neither the best Hines nor the best big band music available through amazon.So, all in all, nice, swinging music, mostly recomended to Hines completists and big band fan(atic)s."
1,boring and unimaginative,I found their ideas to be very pedestrian. There's nothing new or interesting to be found in this book.
1,Not for me,"I wanted to like this book! I bought it because one of the comments was so inflammatory and obviously made by someone with an agenda, that I felt sorry for the writer and wanted to give the book a chance. One of the things that bothered me the most are the random - and incorrect - usages of quotation marks. I just couldn't take the book seriously. There are some cute crafts that young children would enjoy, but there is nothing remotely scary."
3,not so scary,"This book is good if you need some inspiration. There are not a lot of SCARY crafts in this book. The candy wrapper buckets are a cute idea. I also liked the black pumpkins. Some of the crafts were lame. For instance, one was called ""witch hat luminary"" and its made of an orange traffic cone that you spray paint black and put a light under it. Where do you find a traffic cone without stealing one?I would reccomend it if you are looking for cute ideas for a Halloween party but it is not good for a person wanting to create a hard core scary scene."
1,stay away from this author,"I have been working in the design field for over 10 years now and I have yet to see a worse ripp off then this author not only are there no directions to her projects, but who would want to engage them selves in anything that turned out so chic and cheesey. I have personally met the author and her family I knew them for quite a while infact and never did I find that she could creatively enhance a project. she has some small skill in putting together junk so it doesn't look so much like junk. butlets face it - it's still junk. not something I would put in my house nor in my clients homes."
2,Scary??,"I think this book was a little ""too cute"" to have ""Scary"" in the title. While there were a couple of ""scary"" ideas it was overall kiddie focused."
3,"A few cute ideas, NOT scary",Not a bad book for the price. A close look at the cover reveals what most projects are like--cute for preschool children but not scary. Good color photos but annoying that they are not on the page oposite the directions.
2,Not as cute as I pictured it,I thought the stickers would be a lot nicer than they actually were. Waste of $4!
5,This is an excellent kit,"This is an excellent kit that produces all four of the sounds as advertised. It is thrilling for a child when a complex digital circuit works the first time! Velleman kits are excellent, and offer an opportunity to show a child how to solder. I constructed this kit at the local Boys and Girls Club with a 10 year old. We did the soldering together, with me holding the wires and him wielding the soldering iron and solder. The only thing that you need to be careful about is to make sure that the smaller soldering points are carefully done. I recommend that the adult do the soldering of the two chips."
5,Most memorable book of my childhood,"I discovered this book while I was in the 6th grade (many years ago!) and checked it out to reread every time I found it in a school or public library for years afterward. It is so well written, poignant, and heartbreaking that all these years later I still get a catch in my throat when I think of that old knight. I shared it with every child I could over the years, writing to local libraries to find one who still had a copy to borrow.I am so glad that, now I have the chance to share it with grandchildren, it magically has appeared again in print.Margaret Lovett, thank you so very much for creating this story that has meant so much to me over the years. I have been a voracious reader all my life, and very few books have captured my heart like this story. This is a masterpiece, for boys and for girls!"
1,Flimsy garbage,"This kit won't work unless you sew everything. The yarn hair doesn't stick, with or without glue. The ribbons fray when they're cut. The tape doesn't stick. The directions are improbable (""make even pleats around the waist"" of a flimsy piece of lace while applying it to double-sided tape?). For the same effort as this doll, you can make a doll from your own scraps at home, and it will be far more durable."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"This was a waste of money and time.I thought it would be fun for my daughter to make a doll.She picked this one because of the pink so was so happy until she tried to put the doll together.This kit comes with the body ,yarn hair,glue,color pencils,ribbon,pink mesh for the tutu,and double-sided tape.The only thing that stayed on the doll was the hair that had to be glued on which was also messy.the tape is cheap and does not stick onto the body but it did to the pink mesh.This doll was put in the trash if your daughter just has to have this kit don't follow the directions try your own way of putting this doll together."
3,Orazio two tone comfort fit wedding band.,"I gasped when I first saw it online, it was so beautiful. After receiving it though, it was heavier, and wider than I had wanted. The company charges a $40 restocking fee on returned items, so I kept it."
5,Excellant!,"We placed the order for this ring on 11/5, received it FedEx on 11/11! It came from Canada to Georgia in one day. The ring is absolutely beautiful. The details are stunning. It is a very smooth fit & a perfect fit. It's even prettier than the picture. I love it! I will definitely buy from this company again."
5,Gorgeous!,We bought this ring as a wedding band for myself. In person it is absolutely gorgeous! I was so excited to see it and am very happy that we decided to buy it! I love that they mixed silver and gold to make it more affordable. Customer service was amazing and helpful and shipping was fast! We highly recommend this and the Allegra ring as wedding bands!
5,Great arrangements!,"These sixteen songs were included on the 1987 CD ""Short Stops"" (RCA 5917-2-RB), along with four songs from the Marlon Brando movie The Wild One.All songs were recorded between January 12 and July 14, 1953.The bands are West Coast all-stars, including Art Pepper, John Graas, Hampton Hawes, Joe Mondragon, Shelly Manne, Maynard Ferguson, Pete Condoli, Bud Shank, Marty Paich, Curtis Counce, Jimmy Giuffre, Herb Geller, Bill Holman, Bill Perkins, Bob Cooper and Russ Freeman.This is some of the best West Coast Jazz I'm aware of. I wonder if the critics of West Coast Jazz are familiar with these recordings. No apologies are needed to like this stuff!"
4,Buen Disco de Merengue,"Este disco empieza con su mejor tema, ""Como Baila"", ya que pasaron tres an_os y esta cancion se oye mucho en las discotecas tropicales. Una de las mejores canciones de este conjunto merenguero. Le daria cinco estrellas sin los temas 3 y 9. Pero los otros temas son buenos"
3,Helpful questions,"This product is extremely helpful for those persons taking medical genetics boards, genetic counseling boards, and molecular/cytogenetics boards. However, several sections have one or two questions with debatable answers, so proceed with caution, as some of the answers are not always practical."
1,Falling apart,I was so excited about this quilt. I designed my daughters whole room around it. Have had the quilt not even a year and most of the seams have literately disenigrated. There is not even enough good material to try to repair it.
4,Very to the Point.,"This book has very helpful information. It is a quick easy read. Not a lot of fluff, but to the point."
5,1950 Fordman,"I have owned several Tripp lite UPS units. Two destroyed by lightning,but all attached equipment survived. My last Tripp lite Internet Office 750VA took a tremendous line surge which shut down all electronics, Microwave and electric range. No damage to any attached equipment, my DVD recorder was damaged but it was connected to a household surge protector. Tested the new unit after charging for 12 hours, and it worked as expected, computer and peripherals stayed in operation during test. Thank you Tripp lite, as I haven't lost any computer equipment to lightning or surges.1950 Fordman"
4,Good product,"I had the tripp lite 750VA for two months now and the product has performed well. I used it in my office for computers and back-up drive. The power to our building experience infrequent black out or spikes, and each time, I was able to save my work and shutdown the computer without any problem.The extra receptacles were misleading, since UPS is only supplied to three out of the 12 available. It would be better to color code the UPS receptacles to orange so that you don't have to guess which one is UPS and which one is not."
3,Works only with i.Tech headphones!,"I bought the earlier version of this adapter because it worked perfectly with a set of headphones I already have. However, this version of the adapter now only works with the manufacturer's headphones (i.Tech Bluetooth headset/headphone) and not those with a password or default key of 1234 which most bluetooth stereo headphones have.So if you are hoping these will work with your headphones, check the passkey. If your headphones default key is 1234, this will not connect to them."
5,Klezmer Therapy,"When nothing else works, grab this Klezmer CD.Soon you'll be dancing on your grave and spitting in the Devil's eye."
4,They got it right!,"The product was delivered promptly, and it was correct. Amazon's packaging said it was Signature.Escada doesn't label this product, i.e. Signature, so I had to wait confirmation that it truly was correct when my daughter opened it, smelled it, and said, ""Yes, this is what I wanted.""Escada Signature By Escada For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5 oz"
2,Great film with a horrible dubbed audio track,"The movie itself is fantastic, but this specific DVD comes with no English subtitles. It is dubbed and there is no original Japanese audio track. The quality of audio really does make you feel that you are watching a 50-year-old movie, too. Finally, the actors in this English-language audio seem to imitate Japanese accent."
1,Buggy player software.,"I bought the player as a gift for my wife. Unfortunately, nearly every time she turns it on, it needs to ""rebuild"" the library. After consulting with Creative email tech support, I reformatted its disk and reloaded its firmware. This didn't fix the ""rebuild"" problem, but did eliminate a tendency for the player to freeze completely on occasion.Creative told me that they are not aware of any firmware bugs that could cause the problem, and didn't offer to swap the unit so that they could investigate the probem(s) themselves.Unfortunately, Creative's software isn't stable yet and the company tech support is unresponsive. I hope your experience is better than mine has been. In the meanwhile, I'm going to wait a year before purchasing from them again."
2,Headphone Jack Breakdown,"I've had my Zen Xtra a little over 2 months. I like the fact that I can get so much storage on the cheap. The sound on the Zen is great too. The option to replace the battery is also a great option. All was well until today when for no apparent reason, I could only get sound from the right earphone. I tried plugging other headphones in the jack and sound still only came from the right side. It's a good thing that I bought a replacement plan because I am returning this thing tomorrow. If you consider buying the Zen DO buy a replacement plan. I am very hesitant to buy other Creative products."
4,I am in a state of Zen of my Zen,I love my Zen. No problems what so ever. The only negative is the case. I wish it had a window on the front cover so I could see the song playing with out having to open it.
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,This is the only product I have ever purchased that I would ever IMPLORE people NOT to buy. I actually bought one and had to have it replaced after 6 months when it just stopped working. The second one is full of bugs that screw up song sequence. The battery dies quickly and the player likes to shut off for no apparent reason. Customer service is a joke. I'm not saying spend the extra money on an Ipod but STAY AWAY FROM CREATIVE!!!
1,Terrible build quality,Headphone input has broke inside the device after only 2 months of use.Now I am able to hear only one stereo channel.Will send it to repair soon.No Creative devices for me anymore.
1,Don't buy this piece of crap if you have Windows XP,"I bought this based on what appeared to be solid positive reviews from satisfied customers. To my dismay, I've had nothing but a big headache trying to install the necessary software/ drivers onto my pc. After 3 emails back and forth to Creative's technical support department, and trying every suggestion they had, I'm still left with a player that won't work. Don't waste your time or money on this!!"
1,Worst Customer Service i've ever had,"I had this mp3 player for not very long. The hook up to the cumputer was loose. Aswell as the other review they said we had forced the usb in on the Nomad. WE NEVER DID SUCH A THING. THEY SHOULD STAND UP TO THERE WARENTY AND NOT ACCUSE PEOPLE. I AM NOT PAYING $80 DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING THAT IS $250. ON THE OTHER HAND,You can get your self an HP. They have the best prices and customer service. I had a broken mouse pad and they fixed it with a total of $0 plus $0 in shipping. Creative Sucks."
2,Flimsy product,"I recently bought the Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra, and didn't even get as far as charging the battery. The construction of the player is the cheesiest I have ever seen--the front panel refused to clip in correctly, leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player. This gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched. I can't comment on the quality of the audio, because it was back at the store before I ripped a single CD.I'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something I paid over 250 dollars for. If the casing of the player is this bad, I can't image that the hardware is of very good quality. Don't be pulled in by the great price--you get what you pay for, and there's a reason this model is so cheap."
3,headphone jack,"I bought this before traveling to holland for 6 months and i loved it. Its got good sound, its still a lot smaller than a portable cd player, it holds a ton of songs. And its relatively cheap. I paid $250. Here in holland its almost 400 ($500)The only bad thing is the headphone jack. my friend and i who came to holland had the same problem with the headphone jack going out. It still works, just the connection has to be just right or you lose it. It gets frustrating after awhile.Other than that this is a great machine and i would recommend it, just get the warranty so you can get it fixed right the first time. The value of this player is much higher than the I-pod."
2,Poor Build Quality,bought this unit when i got shall i say angry at Apple s Itunes music store. I had one of the new Apple Ipods which i havw since sold on Ebay. As for the Zen Xtra. the build quality and design is horrible compared to the solid feeling Ipod. In my case the front casing which covers the replaceable battery keeps popping off if I hold it in the wrong way. There is a tab on the bottom which is supposed to release the face but if i hold the sides it keeps popping off. The blue tinted backlight is hard to read and the menus are hard to use compared to the Ipod. this unit feels like a cheap walkman. It is also bulky and heavy. The one good thing I can say is the sound is better than the Ipod which i guess is worth something.
1,Harddisk failure after 6 months,"Note that the user manual says you cannot jog with this device, which to me means it can't take normal teenager use. I'm not buying another one for my child."
2,Could never get CDDB to work on Windows 98,"This is a terrific little music jukebox ... but I have had one very annoying problem. The CDDB service (which provides the track titles for your CD's) would not work on my Windows 98 machine. I beilieve that this is a Creative problem, because CDDB was working with Music Match on that machine. Tech support was responsive, but their advice (which I wasted hours implementing) provided no help. So, despite the promise of being able to use this machine on more than one computer, I was actually only able to get the software working on my XP machine. So, I'm happy with what works, but pretty annoyed with the hours wasted, lack of effective tech support, and ultimately the lack of support for my Windows 98 machine."
1,Beware - no customer support,"Stay away from creative - far away. They only want your money. The unit itself - a creative zen 20 gb - has a few quirks but operated sufficiently. However, it did not hold up well and each time a repair was made, we were charged $100 minimum. Now, just over a year later, the headphone jack no longer makes contact. We were told ""This unit is no longer supported"" but we were offered a REFURBISHED unit (now, where did that come from?) for a price more expensive than a brand new 30 gb unit. I thinks its time to get an iPOD.Consider me a disgusted, former customer of Creative. I will never buy their products again. I expect a several hundred dollar item to last longer than a year and to be supported as well."
3,"Good, but not great.","This being my first MP3 player, I have nothing to compare it to. It works well and I do like it. BUT, the earphones are the worst design I have seen in my life. They make absolutely no sense. I quickly had to pay to replace them. The front panel does pop off rather easily. It has happened to me twice in one month. And it does lock up rather easily as well. They warn you that it might and how to fix it...but why should it...and so often. The software works well and is quickly learned. I like that you can create and revise playlists so easily on your PC and they convert to the player well. BUT...what is up with the buttons and scroll knob? It is cumbersome. And I have yet to find a way to stop playback other than turning it off. That is odd. Great memory and storage though. OH...and the case that covers the face is very annoying. You are constantly popping it open to make any changes to the songs being played. Very poor design."
4,CD Collection in your pocket,"I got this for Christmas, and it is a great gift. I have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks, and the ease of use is wonderful. The memory will hold an amazing amount of songs, my entire collection of CD's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun. Plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the Nomad. The only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system, and the traveling case it comes with. This is a powerful piece of equipment. It is great to no longer wonder what music I want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip- now I just take everything. Ripping the songs, even with my 1.1 USB connection is still very quick, and the quality is very good. Considering the price and specs, this might be the best buy out there for a large memory MP3 player. Before jumping on the Ipod train, take a look at this marvel."
1,Nightmare,"Awful, awful, awful. Unlike my 3 other MP3 players, this thing will only work properly if you have ID3 tags on all of your tracks. If you don't have tags, it'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the Zen does not recognize folders. It's a shame, but mine is going back. Bummer as it has great sound quality."
2,Not able to install,"Getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience. The CD just has too many problems with Win XP. I am going to have to try an online download and see if that works.Also, the instruction manual is very bad."
1,Agree that is a pop clap trap,"I agree w/ all the other reviewers that we sought this soundtrack to hear the gorgeous score not these ""hits."" Why are marketing people so dense and out of touch w/ the targeted demo? Hopefully but not promisingly a reissue will make the score available. It's one of the best things about the movie.Boo."
2,An Addams Family Wannabe,"As someone who once worked and trained new Cast Members at WDW's Haunted Mansion I can only hope that the idiots in their Marketing Dept. are being strung up for this clearly cheap pandering attempt to get the pop music dollar. Bad enough the film turned out poorly, and it is only compounded by this pile of tracks that aren't even in the film--save for Iz You--the unnecssary and out of place rap song that appears over the closing credits ala the Addams Family movies. How un-original and desparate. Two stars though for Mr. Mancina's beautiful score. It is the only thing that redeems this CD. Though God knows the same idioits in Marketing will be rolling it out at as must-have album every Halloween as if it's on the level of a Mannhiem Steamroller Christmas or something. Ugh!"
1,Good Grief...,"can someone tell me what 12 of these songs have to dow ith the Haunted Mansion movie or ride? besides tracks 2 (love bNL btw), 13 and 14 this is a ""let's see how many halloween remakes we can fit onto one album and claim it has to do with the movie"".i'm still looking for Thriller and Ghostbusters on the track listing."
2,Not what I thought,"If, like me, you are looking for music from the movie, this is NOT the CD you want. There is hardly any music from the movie on this CD at all. If you are looking for some mood music for your next halloween party, you might like this CD. If I could go back and redo my order of this CD, I would not buy it."
4,good halloween material,"Overall, I think it was a great album. I only had a few problems-1)very few of these tracks are actually in the movie (#13, 14)2)why was nelly playing during the credits and then not even on the soundtrack??3)why wasn't the movie (or at least this soundtrack) released in late october...sounds like a horrible marketing failure to me.Anyway, the reason I gave it 4 stars despite the above mentioned was because:1) the original score was absolutely beautiful.2) the remake of ""Spooky"" done by the Conti Bros. (originally by the Rascals, 1968) was fresh and had a good sound to it (among other remakes). Needless to say, I am keeping my eye out for those Conti Brothers in the future.3) you can't go wrong with the good ol' Jackson 5!It's definitely worth the 15 bucks I paid for it at Best Buy."
2,Where's the rest of the Score?,"After seeing the movie, I really enjoyed Mark Mancina's score, but was disappointed to find that the only CD only came with the overature. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great piece, but I don't really like or appriciate rock and pop.I did find it halarious to find the singing busts version of Grim, Grinning Ghosts. I enjoy listening to this song every now and then because it makes me laugh and reminds me of the old Disneyland Sing-a-Long movie I used to watched.If you're looking for the score to this movie, I'm sad to say that I think this is it. Just get it from the library or borrow it from a friend. Unless it's really cheap on sale, I doubt I'll ever buy this CD."
5,Worth It!,"The soundtrack is great. Great for any halloween pary. I saw the movie and thought it was a good story. My favorite song was #14. However, not all the songs listed are in the movie. I also couldn't find nelly's song featured in the credits. Overall, I believe this is worth buying."
2,Too Slow.,"Bases Loaded is an okay game. It just moves too slow for me just like the real thing. That's why I hate baseball. In Bases Loaded, there are too many waiting moments when I just want things speeded up. It takes way too long to finish a game. I am able to win one, but really, the pennant race? Forget it. I had more fun with Baseball Stars. Bases Loaded doesn't really mimic the real thing, and some of the controls at certain times are quite awkward. All in all, Bases Loaded is not a game I would be playing again."
4,A classic,"My five year old son enjoyed this movie, but I think he would have liked a little more action. It deals with some subject matter that was too much for my two year old, and did not hold his interest at all. Overall it's a good movie with a great moral. I would recommend it for an older child."
3,Possibly Wearing Down,"I have had this card for my canon camera for almost a year...and for quite a while it was working PERFECTLY. But during the last two months it has gotten slower and slower. After I take a single picture (I was able to take many quickly together) it gives me the busy signal and I have to wait several seconds before I can take another. As far as I can tell it is not a problem with my camera or the battery...so I'm thinking its the card. Next time I will purchase a faster, better quality card."
2,Be careful,"Be careful and know what you are ordering. I got a camera with this order, and the memory card it needed was smaller than this one. I am looking for the packing slip to send it back. Be sure and know what size of memory card you need before getting one."
1,Sandisk 2GB,I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesn't allow for more photos after only using 40mb. I have tried to format the disk using the camera and through Windows XP. It doesn't allow it to be formatted. Bad investment!!! Would not recommend the product unless there is a way I can get a refund or an exchange.
5,One for your collection! A MUST!,"I am so thankful to have stumbled across Marta Gomez' music. This is my favorite of her albums. The recording is very, very good. Such depth and detail between the instruments and her voice. Buy a few extra for friends!"
1,I wouldn't wish this highchair on my worst enemy!,"I have only had one high chair so I don't know how to compare it to others but after becoming pregnant with my second baby, I am not only not keeping it, I would not even give it away- it is going in the trash. There are so many grooves that are food traps. You literally need a toothpick or toothbrush to clean after every use. The liners are not supposed to get wet and after not listening to the instructions and rinsing it in the sink, it is now covered in mold. SO GROSS. Please save yourself and do not purchase this highchair!"
5,I love it!,"The songs in this CD are wonderful, and BoA's voice is beautiful too. I'm a BoA's fan and I bought this single in China with 50 yuan. I think it's worth collecting to a BoA's fan. The melody and the instrument are perfect! If you are a BoA's fan, don't miss this wonderful single!"
4,Thieves can be heros????....with Stuart yes they can!,"Anne Stuart does it again, this time casting an ex-cat burglar as the hero. Ferris (Francesca) Byrd is the heroine and I must say..there is never a dull moment with this book.The chemistry between these two characters is what makes this book great. I liked the honest and forthright approach that Blackheart takes with Ferris. He is instantly attracted to her and the sparks fly immediately between them.Ferris was also a character to enjoy. Her uptight and superficial demeanor falls apart as the reader gets to see her behind closed doors....more comfortable in jeans and a ""messy"" type of person. I identified with her and her need to present herself to the world in a more perfect light.This book is pure entertainment (and we get more in the next book Catspaw 2)!"
5,ANOTHER GRAMMY AWARD~!,"This artist just keep on going~! I loved her first song I heard by accident, started to buy up ALL her albums. This album is one of her BEST album, well as usual, YOU SIMPLY CAN NOT GO WRONG buying ANY of her ALBUMs. I thought BEATLES was the only ARTIST on the PLANET that you can not go wrong with ANY of their album. I love this new discovery, and listening to such POWERFUL SOFT INSPIRING SPIRITUAL sound and music. WOW..........WOW~!!!!!!!"
1,Disappointed,"After listening to Grace, I thought I wanted every album from Snatum Kaur. But after receiving this album, I was thoroughly disappointed. I expected at least 6 songs. What I received was 3 Interfaith Prayers which were all thoroughly disappointing. This album does not reflect the ability and talent of Snatum Kaur, and I'm really disappointed."
1,ESPRESSO MAKER,"ORDER FROM AMAZON.COMFREE SHIPING,CAME IN IN 3 DAYS INSTEAD OF 1WEEK,THE PRICE FROM AMAZON FOR THIS MODEL IS ABOUT 100$ CHEAPER THANOTHER STORES.THE MACHINE WORK WELL, MAKE GOOD COFFEE. I ENJOY IT VERYMUCH, HIGHLY RECCOMMANT TO ANY ONE WHO LOOKING FOR ESPRESSO MACHINE"
4,Great collection,"I picked this up after buying the Trojan skinhead box set. I like the skinhead box set better, however, this one is not far behind the other. I highly recommend these collections. They are one of a kind."
3,OK. But No!!,This book has great information in it but it does not give guideance as to the job of a church usher and how that job should be conducted.
5,Great study on this rarely talked about subject,This is a great study on a topic not too often discussed. I would recommend this book if you're looking to explore what the bible says about angels.
5,Eve and womanhood in Genesis and after,"A wonderful analysis of the Biblical account of the first woman's life, including midrash and modern poetry dealing with Eve, much of which was new to me."
5,It's a Heck of a Mug...,"This is a mug and it's made in the visage of the great Garfield. My girlfriend loves it, but she's afraid to actually use it for coffee because she thinks it's a collector's item and she doesn't want to risk damaging it. Buy it, drink beverages from it, and enjoy the fat-cat, I say...Bottom line: It's a great mug."
5,Different,A good gift for a person you want to create a relationship. Garfield is a good caracter for this purpose.
2,Great features but poor sound quality,"This phone had all the features I was looking for: caller ID display, call waiting/caller ID, flashing indicator light when you have a voice mail message (which is hard to find on a phone that does not have a built-in answering machine) and the display lit up.The only problem was that the sound quality was poor. It sounded as if the person on the other end of the line was very far away - sort of a hollow sound. This sounded the same to the person on the other end of the line. The handset volume adjustment only had two settings and the low was too quiet and the high was too loud. I ended up returning this phone because of the poor sound quality."
2,A long hard search,"I've been searching for this cd for a while. I like the S.O.S. Band and especially the song ""Weekend Girl"". I've always seen the S.O.S Band Cd, never with the titled song weekend girl. Finally, I searched again, Amazon had it. I'm very pleased with the cd and I like the other songs on the CD some of the old classic. I'm an ol skool person and the cd brings back memories."
4,SOS Band Greatest Hits Review,Covers all of the hits I remember. Well worth the money if you don't have the albums.
3,"Good, but short version of Weekend Girl!!!","I mainly bought this for the song Weekend Girl, but was very disappointed when it was the short version...there is a longer, better version, now i have to find out what album this is on? anyone know???"
4,"Big, Big saw","This is THE tool for cutting 4xs and 6"" Glu-lams. I was surprised at the smooth opperation of this saw on doug fir glu-lams and SYP 4x8s. The 32 tooth blade is the correct unit for very good cuts while framing. The only thing I do not like about this tool is the thumb safety button. Re-locating it to the forward handle would be a big help and ensure that the operator keeps both hands on the saw when starting it. I found myself using my left index finger to press the ""safety"" button to start each cut, therby removing my L hand from the saw. My right thumb is too large to work the [safety] button."
4,Good information,"The material covered is good, but I liked the book Henche on Painting better. No color images."
3,Hawthorne Simply Presented,This is a bold attempt to present the methods and secrets of Hawthorne's painting techniques through the notes of various lectures by the painter. Somewhat difficult to follow for casual reading.
3,History of the Cape Cod School,A good historical description of the early history of the school and its leader. The book explains the artists approach to the use of color as the main influence in the development of painting the light in a painting.
1,repeats a few tips over ad nauseum,repeats 'paint with spots of colour' throughout the book. doesn't say much of anything beyond that. weak.if you are looking for a book with tons of great advice and solid mental approaches to painting i recommend 'painting secrets from a master' by david leffel. The title is cheesy but the painting advice is great for people into realism.
