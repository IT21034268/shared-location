4,Working out well for our cat,"Very easy to use and our overweight cat, Teller, took to it very quickly, is fun to watch him play with it to get his food and he understood quickly what he needed to do to get the food."
2,Not right for us,"The holes, even when adjusted, were either too big and leaked treats all over the floor or too small and no treats would come out. Our cat lost interested because it wasn't a challenge to get the treats out (we used Pounce treats)"
2,Maybe useful for not super smart cats,"My cat won't use this, she figured out just the right angle to hit against a corner and viola- she gets all the food out very quickly and doesnt seem to get much excercise. But she isn't much of a play-cat so I can see how this would not appeal to her,"
4,Very helpful for piglets,"I like this ball for my little guy because he eats his treats so fast and my little girl eats her kitty treats so slow. I give him a few pieces on the floor, put the rest in the ball and roll it away- which gives his 'sister' time to eat her treats unmolested. I don't make the holes too small however because he'll give up too quickly. The little dude wants results without too much effort or he'll abandon it."
5,exactly what i was looking for!,"my vet recommended this because my two sister cats (Alice and Trixie) are a little chubby (15 and 14 lbs) ... ok ok ...so a lot chubby ... I went all over to pet stores and they looked at me like I was nuts when I tried to describe a ""feed ball"" ... so I came home very discouraged and worried because Alice has a heart murmur and Trixie is prone to diabetes so they both have to lose weight. I googled the feed ball and low and behold it came up at Amazon !! The price was perfect as well as the size and it came in a matter of days! Alice and Trixie seem to enjoy it and I think I can actually see that they have waist lines! Thank you soooooooo much !"
4,"Ball works well, but my cat doesn't","The balls works just as described. Unfortunately my cat is too lazy to chase it. He doesn't even seem to be interested in eating the little treats that it leaves in a trail. It hasn't anything to do with the product itself, just my lazy cat (smile). I urge others to give this a try because it is a good product."
4,Great activity.,I have two cats and the smarter of the two loves it! It took no time for her to figure it out. My other cat just waits for the 1st one to bat it and it releases the food. Maybe she's actually the smart one!
1,my cat wouldn't go for it,"Maybe it's a good idea but... My cat just wouldn't go for it. I guess she's set in her ways. I tried and tried ""training"" her but she has no interest in eating her food away from her food dishes. She's unusual in that she won't touch people food, and the only food she'll eat that's offered to her outside of her food dish is an occasional cat food ""treat."" (She's not picky about her food, but obviously feels it belongs in her dish and not on the floor in other areas of the house.) I wasn't happy stepping on stray pieces of dry food laying around the floors either.So...Didn't work for us."
2,my cat seems to hate the plastic,"it's a cool idea, but my cat seems to not stand the smell of the plastic or something. he won't get near it. he smells it and recoils just like he does for oranges. if i roll it myself he will eat any treats that fall out but he won't get near the ball no matter what i do. i'm going to give it to a friend to see if it works for her."
4,Very nice!,"Got this for our older cat and she figured it out right away, even though she isn't particularly inquisitive. We use Ami Cat which she loves, but the kibble is rather small sized, so it exits the holes rather quickly. I marked one of the smaller holes in the closed position and drilled and filed it, which made a single hole rather than three, and the kibble dispenses at a nice rate now. This is the reason I subtracted one point, the holes and adjustment should allow for more variety in kibble size and dispensing rate.You might want to consider how oily your cat's dry food is too before ordering this item - I wouldn't want greasy cat food oiling up the inside of the ball and my floors. You also might want to order a brightly colored version of this ball, the blue one we have is hard to see in poor lighting, and so makes a trip hazard for us humans. The ball is very easy to fill via the removable cover opposite the dispensing side."
4,For my Tubby Tabby...,"We bought this item in the hopes that it would simultaneously get our ""large"" cat some exercise, and get him to leave us alone when he's hungry long before feeding time. It definitely helps with the between-meal begging, but I don't think he gets ANY exercise out of it! He just nudges the ball around ever-so-slightly until a little food falls out.Overall, I think the product does what it's supposed to. My cat is just lazy. That's not the manufacturer's fault!"
3,Pros and Cons,"Pros:-Our 2 cats had to slow down their eating and spread out their dinner from 5pm to morning. This made them beg me for food less.-They did move around a bit more.-The product is made well. It was easy to adjust the size of the openings.Cons:-Our 2 cats would eat each others' food. One is on Rx food which is why that was a problem.-The food balls leave a mess of crumbs and cat food dust on the carpet which might have brought in a mouse. Technically, Meow Meow got exercise by catching the mouse!-One cat batted the ball back and forth. The other pushed it with her face. Not really much of a workout.-One cat, Sophia, kept getting her stuck in corners and behind the armchair. Then she'd meow pathetically and I'd feel bad.Conclusion:If you want to increase your cats exercise, use a laser pointer or Da Bird instead. If you have to slow down their eating, this is great, but be prepared to sweep or vaccuum almost every day."
4,Fun,I was hoping to use this ball to let the cats hunt their food as described in one of the pets blogs on Amazon but they didn't like it nearly as much as I do. The ball is well made and can hold any treats we would use. I've been using it to play with the cats rather than expecting them to play with it on their own. It's working out pretty well and we're all enjoying it now.
1,Kitty had no interest.,"This would have worked great if.....My cat wanted anything to do with it haha. I got it because he is always begging for food and he when I do feed him, he eats too fast. He understood how to use the ball, but wouldn't touch it after a few turns. He wanted his bowl. When I put it down the next morning, he was purrrriiinngg like crazy. I guess you can't teach a 4 year old kitty new tricks."
3,Stupid cat,My cat still has not figured out how to get treats/food out of ball. BUT MY pug loves it..;
1,Design Flaw: is not appropriate for small kibble,"I bought this item (in pink) to slow down my overweight cat, who typically scarfs down her kibble in 3 minutes or less. Currently, my cat is eating Wellness Core (a very small kibble) or Wysong Epigen (which is even smaller!)This item has a major design flaw and thus is NOT appropriate for smaller kibble. The food pours out of the 3 holes all at once and does not slow down her feeding at all! Instead, the ball should be adjustable so that only one hole is open at a time and even the one hole should be adjustable to 1/3 of its size, which it is not.Mission not accomplished. Incompatible with small kibble. Will try another product."
2,Not as good as advertised,"Owned a different model before and will be searching for that one.On this one there are two size slot openings, and about 3 openings per size. For my cats there are two many holes my one cat was able to empty it without really having to do any work."
5,"Took a couple weeks, but AWESOME!","I can see this working more and more. My cat figured out that she can just barely move the ball and a little morsel of food will fall out, but even then, I can see her walking and moving around with it a lot more than she used to with a bowl of food. With a bowl, she wouldn't even stand and eat it, she would lay down in front of the food. I think she also gets frustrated that so little comes out at a time that she often walks away for a while and comes back 10-15 minutes later. She was a fat, lazy cat...now she's a little slimmer, and only semi lazy!"
4,It works.,My kitty figured it out pretty quickly and seems to be ok with getting some of her meals this way. The construction is a bit flimsy though. I wonder how long this thing will last...
4,Pretty good,"I have six cats, only one will even use it. The holes aren't really ideal. It's adjustable, but it seems like it's always between too big and too small. If I make it too small, it takes a long time for the cat to get food to come out and he loses interest. Too big and several pieces come out at once with the slightest nudge. It would probably work better for food pellets that are basically round. Still, I'd buy it again, since my one cat seems to enjoy it."
3,decent pet toy,"I purchased this toy as a gift and decided to test it with my own cats before sending it to the recipient. My cats could not care less about it! If your cats are not highly motivated by food, then this might not be an ideal toy for them.The ball is a brighter, sunnier orange than pictured here, which was a pleasant surprise. The packaging really emphasizes the usefulness of the toy for weight loss, perhaps making it an inappropriate gift. (Hey, I got this for your fat ol' cat!)The instructions came inside the toy itself, which wasn't necessarily ideal. I stupidly thought that it opened along its diameter to be filled, when in reality, there is a small twist-off piece on top. I'm glad I realized my folly before breaking the toy! Once open, the toy was easy to fill and adjust to distribute food."
4,Can't teach an old cat new tricks,"I was so excited to get this for my 9-year old Calico. However, I was disappointed to discover that she isn't the brightest, she couldn't figure out the ball for the life of her. So after two days of her wandering around the house crying because she didn't have any food in her bowl and couldn't figure out that if she just moved the ball she would be fed, I gave up. Perhaps my sister's 17 pound Siamese will find better use for it (she's the one who could really use it!)."
3,Easily chewed,"I bought this for my bunnies, one of whom eats so fast he snorts up pellets when they are given to him. This product was able to keep him entertained and reduce his hyper-ness while he eats. The adjustable holes are easy to adjust but finding the right size for pellets is a challenge since they are different lengths. The smaller pieces easily fell out while the mid to longer pieces were for the long haul. My disappointment in this product is mostly in the cheap plastic that was easily chewed to disfigurement. However, considering the price, it's an OK buy. I'd also recommend a better design for securing the cap to the body."
4,"Cute, fun, makes my cats not lazy.","My cats were getting a bit large. I got three of these to give them a chance to work for their food and only eat what they really needed. While two of my fat piggies turned into slim dashing fellows who catch female cats eyes the other cat is still enormously fat. I gave this four stars because I have to search for where the cats bat them to and crums come out on the floor. I think this product will work on most felines, if you have a fat cat then try it out it's worth the price!"
2,Not so good,"This ball does not work unless you have a playful cat or a hungry cat. We had 3 cats to try it out on, and none of them would push it around."
2,eh,"my cats would not even play with it, while it looked nice that was not why I bought it, I wanted them to get moving. My cat laid down reached his paw out and pushed it out of his way...lol"
4,Works really well -- especially if you have just one cat,"I got these because I have two cats and one of them is obsessed with food and could stand to lose about a pound. I figured I could put some dry cat food in it and he'd have to ""work"" to get it. I got two of them so my other cat could have one too. What I found was that the Less Hungry Cat would nudge the ball and the Hungry Cat would gobble the food. I could never figure out a way they could play with them without Hungry Cat getting all the food, all the time. So I ended up donating them to a local cat shelter. They actually do work really well, just didn't work for my situation."
2,"lots of holes, not enough options","i bought this for my cat who is inclined to eat all of whatever we put out, all at once. we use small food: iam's low residue, which is a little bigger than fish food pellets. the problem with this ball is that there are too many holes, and too much food comes out at one time. when you try to adjust the holes in the middle, the holes towards the top open up. it's just not a very good design, unfortunately. we bought another ball that has one hole and a twisty spiral inside of it that prevents all of the food from reaching the hole-end of the ball right away. seems to be working better. there's also a ball that has a divider in the middle of it to do the same thing, but the weight makes it hard for cats to use on hardwood."
2,My cats don't like it,My cats just look at it like it's an alien. They seem to be slightly afraid of them. The only way the food is getting out is when I accidentally kick it. Then they will eat the food from the floor. Not recommended by me. Too bad they're so big and noisy.
4,Mixed Results,"I LOVE this item, but my cats are not so sure. My female (who is usually the dumb one!) figured it out in the first day. The boys aren't so sure. They will come running now when they hear me roll it or shake it, but they haven't figured out how to roll it themselves. But they're going to have to figure it out because I am cutting down on their food bowls. I'd actually like to buy several of them to have around the house because each one holds about 1/4 to 1/2 of their normal daily food intake. I think that would force them to cut back without totally starving them."
2,Maybe if you started with younger cats,"I had very high hopes for this product. Truthfully, it was almost everything it was advertised to be. Except successful. I don't really blame the product -- it's kind of a brilliant idea, really. It just didn't happen to work for my three cats, two of whom are 3 and one of whom is 10. It has mostly resulted in me playing soccer with the ball while the cats watch. Little pellets of kitty food are sprinkled all over the floor, which the cats refuse to eat no matter how hungry they are because, you know, they're cats. I do think if you started your young cat out with this, it might be successful. But then, young cats are typically getting enough exercise already. Of course, if you're interested in getting more exercise yourself with a fairly disinterested feline audience, this is definitely the way to go."
4,works,"My cat does not have a weight problem, but I bought this and put treats or catnip in it. It works great by releasing little bits.Only negative is that I usually can't find it. It's under the couch or under the baking rack or where ever she stuffed it."
3,"Good idea, but cats don't quite get it","I love the idea of this cat toy/feeder....especially since I have a fat cat. Unfortunately, my cats just aren't interested in it. When I put cat food in it, the only time they touch it is if they accidentally brush up against it. I also tried putting cat treats in it (just to spur interest). One cat just pushes it around with her nose until she gets something out of it (there's no ""play"" involved), and one cat just looks at it until she gets distracted by something shiny in the next room. I finally got sick of it and put it away...I kept accidentally kicking it. The ball would go flying, and food would fall everywhere. I will continue to try to get them to use it, but it's not looking good."
2,Neither of my cats like it,"I have 2 indoor cats and I bought this toy so they could run around and play and get some exercise. They both got scared of this ball and ran away. I tried to put their favorite cat food cereal and treats inside and rolled the ball around so they could play... Regardless, neither cat approached the ball. What a waste of my money..."
4,Works just as described,"I use two of these to feed my chunky kitties their meals. They wolfed down their food and used to puke it back up, and these balls make them eat slower and get off their flabby cat butts. We use REALLY small kibble in them and it still works perfectly. One star off because every so often they manage to knock it around enough to get the plug out and dump the contents, but this is a fluke not an every day occurrence by any means. Also, the hole adjustment thing doesn't always stay set on the right setting (my cats are rather violent trying to get the food out), but even on the largest hole setting they have to roll it just right for kibble to get out, so it works well no matter what. Highly recommend!"
1,"Good Idea, bad product.","This toy is a creative idea yet in actuality is not what I thought it would be. The holes in the sides of the ball, while adjustable, are still too big and thus allowing the treats or food to fall out too easy. The point of the ball is to grab cats attention and have them play with it and have treats or food randomly fall out. I filled it with food to test it out and closed the holes to the smallest setting. My cat played with it and with one hit all of the food fell out onto the floor. My cat then ate all the food and had no further interest in the ball because was empty. I am not happy with this product at all and would look for another similar toy if looking for a ball toy dispenser."
5,Entertaining Torture Device,My poor obese cat! She took to this food distribution product right away and it really is amusing to watch her try and open the main port where you put the food in. Luckily this little ball has a locking design to thwart such efforts made by cats who are too smart for their owners own good.I recommend this item to anyone who has a food gobbling kitty. This ball slows them down and makes eating a less mindless activety....they should make these for us fat humans.
1,Bad design,"Great idea, poor execution. The ball is cheaply made, the ""locking tab"" slips under the lip causing the ball to come apart. There is a gap between the two halves. The smallest possible setting on the size of the dispensing holes is too large for normal cat kibble. Will work for dog-sized kibble, but ball is far too flimsy to stand up to a dog. I purchased the fun kitty Egg cersizer next, and it was much better."
4,It works,"I ordered this to slow down my cat's eating. He had begun to put on weight when I was no longer able to work from home, presumably because he was bored. When I reduced the amount of food I gave him each day, he would eat what I gave him quickly then cry for more.The ball has made his food last all day while I'm gone, and he's a lot calmer when I get home, which makes life more pleasant for me. It's too soon to know if he will actually lose weight.My only quibble is that the instructions, including how to open the thing, are packed *inside* the ball. The little handle to open it wasn't immediately obvious, and I nearly broke the thing trying to open in at the ""equator"". Note, therefore, that you open this by turning the little handle at one pole and removing the circular door."
2,Okay for now,"My two cats took to this toy immediately, but on day one, I see that the build quality may not be that great. The screw cap where you put in the kibble becomes loose after the cats play with it. It hasn't come off yet during play, but it's really only a matter of time. The mechanism to adjust the aperture to release the kibble is also very flimsy, and doesn't hold the exact setting....so this means that more food could fall out fast or that no food could fall out at all. I like the concept, and this has come closest to what I'm looking for, but the execution could have been handled better. Sure this is a cheap and easily replaceable toy, but it should have been built with some longevity in mind....the recycle bin doesn't need to be piled up with a string of these toys."
5,Works Great with the TurboTrack!,"If you have a kitty that:1) likes to inhale his food and barfs2) or is a kitten more interested in playing than eating3) or is a bit overweight and just needs to slow down to have the time to realize they are full...then you may be interested in the feeding station I setup! (see picture)I picked up a few of these food distributor balls and a couple Bergan Turbotracks from Amazon and created a little area to contain the food ball, so you don't end up stepping on kibble as the ball gets pushed around who knows where.The distributor ball is plastic, but its dishwasher safe, brainless easy to use, durable, adjustable, and takes seconds to fill as you just twist the top off and scoop it right into your bag of kibble, no need to measure since you can just fill it half-way or full and easily know how much you're feeding. =)"
3,Cat did not go for it ..but dog did,"My cat did not like this at all. He wouldn't even touch it and didn't understand how it worked--although that's probably because he's not really the smartest.However, my dog loved it. It rolls around very well and has 2 different hole settings to adjust for either difficulty or size of the food. Not sure how much other cats eat, but I thought this held the perfect amount of kibble for my cat and even dog.So verdict: Cat would rather starve than use this ball. Dog would rather push this ball than eat from his bowl."
4,Great idea for cats that need to lose some weight.,My cat liked this ball and it did help her not eat so much in a day. The only problem we had was that the ball would get batted under furniture and my cat would come and complain to me that she couldn't get her ball out from where it got stuck.
3,works ok.,"Its not bad considering it costs so little, but they don't' really chase the ball around. They just nudge it till some food trickles out. It at least slows their eating down so they don't get sick and now they realize they're full instead of just asking for more food. But this don't get them to self exercise."
4,Very useful,"The only reason why I did not give this five stars is because two of mine have simply vanished in to thin air. I cannot find them, I've moved the furniture, they are gone.So, I bought another, and will probably buy another to feed more than one cat and only feed once a day. It makes feeding an event. Our cats are definitly thinner already. Have not cleaned up kitty throw up since I bought these. Very nice. I had previously tried to make feeding happen one piece of food at a time. Now it happens. We have three cats, they all huddle around the ball and take turns (Kind of) batting it.The learning curve was small. I put some cat nip in the first round. That made the learning curve virtually non existant.Well done!"
3,My cat never used it. And the spare food attracted roaches...,"I thought I caught all the food scattered around the kitchen floor (all from me, trying to push the ball around and get my cat to take interest in it) but I didn't. Attracted roaches.I tried catnip too, no luck. Cats are cats. You take a chance on a new toy/food item."
2,Slim Cat Food Ball,"This only works well if you cat wants to play with it, otherwise it's ineffective as a weight loss solution."
3,A lot smaller than it looks,I thought this was big enough to hold a few days worth of crunchy food. Nope. My cat had it figured out and emptied in about 10 minutes.
3,"works okay, specific size food needed","The food we have for our cat is too small, so either it all comes out fast or not at all--will try with a bigger food and hopefully it will work better."
4,a decent product!,"Does just what it says it will do. Feeds the cat and makes them work for it. Rolls stupidly well on a wooden floor, so be mindful that their exercise will not be as good on wood. The feline sustinence distribution sphere is generally well made, except that the little tab that locks it open isn't very impressive, and may break if it's locked open, and the user doesn't know about the lock, and gives it a good twist. Generally a good product, and might need another one for good measure. (Hint: look for it behind furniture, under furniture, in other rooms, etc.)"
1,Not good for older cats,"I have older cats and found that this product is not good unless you get a kitten. My cats that range from 11 years of age to 15 years of age and wanted nothing to do with this item. The seller however, was able to get it to my home quickly and for that I gave the item a 1 star."
5,Best invention ever!,"It took my two fat cats a couple days to get used to it, but now that they have, it works great! It's the only way I serve dry food.I followed the written instructions and started out with the holes on the large size. As they got the hang of it, I gradually decreased the size of the opening. Now they have to work to get their food. Plus my one cat can't binge (and then vomit) like she's prone to do.The first time you try to open the balls, it's a little confusing (the instructions come inside the ball). Open the ball by turning the end that says multivet. (The thing along the center seam that looks like it might be a latch is actually a lock; once you adjust the ball to the appropriate size, slide the tab up to lock it into place)."
4,"ball is fine, kitty hasn't caught on","The ball design is fine and is sufficiently adjustable, but our cat just doesn't seem to get it. If I bump it and knock some food out she's excited to come and eat it, but hasn't made the connection to do it herself. She did play with it once and scatter food everywhere, but then she didn't eat it. Cats.May 2011 Update: Had some foster kittens for a few weeks and they had no trouble figuring this thing out and emptying it. Maybe they're more playful, or maybe our cat is just too high-class to work for her food like this."
3,Didn't work for my kitty...,"I bought the Slim Cat toy at a pet store for my 14 pound cat who is on a serious diet. Unfortunately he couldn't be more disinterested. He enjoys playing with other toys but this one just doesn't seem to do it for him, as he watched me ""demonstrate"" how it worked and then just ate the food that fell out. I'm going to donate it to a friend's cat and hopefully he'll get some use out of it."
2,Maybe good for very greedy cats?!,"The kibble comes out of this toy really quickly, even when on the smallest setting. Very soon we had kibble everywhere, and kitty didn't have to do much to get it. Also, it's hard plastic and so makes a noise on a tiled/hard floor, which scared our cat a little. I think it's a good idea that doesn't really work in practice."
3,"No problems with product, cat is too stupid.","I cant fault the PetSafe SlimCat Food Distributor Ball in any way. There were no problems with it. It worked liked described, little pieces of food would fall onto the carpet when rolled. Unfortunately, I have a defective cat, who was too stupid to use it."
2,SlimCat Food Distributor Ball,"I suspect this would be a big hit with kittens, but my cats didn't play at all with it. I did get some interaction going by rolling the ball, but then you have food all over the place. The cats didn't discover all of it, so it was wasted."
1,Good concept but cat did not go for it,"I think maybe it needs to be smaller, since my cat likes to chase smaller balls around. I just could not get him interested in this."
5,Make chubby feline work for his dinner,"Slimball + Hamtrac = happier, healther cat. My chubby cat can now eat whenever he wants, but he has to work for it. To keep the ball from getting stuck under furniture, I put it on a foil-lined Hamtrac.Super Pet Run-About Hamtrac."
5,Keeps My Cats Busy,"I have two cats. One figured this out straight away but the other needed a little encouragement. He got it in a day or so and we switched to the harder setting for both cats. To make it a little more challenging, I put some super balls and toys.My cats are big cats and both have hyperthyroid, which tends to make them ravenous so they gulp their food. Enter these lovely little balls: cats work for their food, decreasing their boredom. The balls dispense slowly so the cats need more time to eat their food.ProsGreat boredom busters for kittiesAdjustable openings for larger food sizes or to increase difficultyBetter price than many pet toys!Fairly durable"
4,"Ehh good, but not great","I have a female adult cat and a male kitten. My adult cat is overweight and I had hoped this would be a good way to help increase her activity. She had no interest in it. I showed her how to play with it, she's watched the kitten play with it countless times, but has no interest in it herself. I even tried burying the ball in her food bag overnight so the food smell would be even stronger, but she won't touch it.Additionally, not much play is required to get food out, more of a push the ball and eat the food thing.Now I can use it to put food in for the kitten when I'm gone and not worry about the adult cat eating it, but it doesn't work (for me at least) as I had hoped."
4,Cats enjoy but not dog proof,"Nice product to get my cat to move around more. My dog, however, can't leave it alone. He didn't break it but won't leave it for the cat."
4,Works great- Cat loves it,"I put food in it, shook it once, put it on the floor, and my cat immediately figured out how to use it.For people that say the size holes didn't work with their food. I use Purina and I was able to adjust the holes so 0-3 pieces of food came out whenever my cat hit it.It's also shaped in a way that it usually rolls around in a circle so it doesn't end up rolling all around the house.The one negative thing I can think of is that I did snap it in half once while adjusting it. I was able to pop it right back together, but after many feedings I wonder if it will last. For $6 dollars I can't really complain and would quickly buy another one."
5,Love it!,"All of my cats like it. It was easy for my adult cats to understand what it was. There are two sets of hole, some large for use in the beginning to get them accustomed to it and a smaller set to make it harder to get the food out once they understand what it's for. I love it! I highly recommend it...it's great for bored or overweight cats."
4,"Great product, if only...","My kitten was growing up-and out! I have a tiny apartment, and we're only allowed one pet, so she wasn't getting enough exercise. The PetSafe SlimCat Food Distributor Ball makes her work(out) for her food, and gives her something to do for an extended time. Sometimes, she doesn't even eat it all, so she even eats less. She has slimmed down, and we're both happier! It's very sturdy & well made, easy to fill and adjust, and just what we needed. If it could be adjusted so smaller pieces of food wouldn't fall out so easily, I would give it 5 stars."
2,My cats just laughed,"I brought this after reading about how wonderful it is for overweight cats. Getting them to play and get a measured about of dry food too, helping them loose weight. Well, that is all well and good if your cats will play with it.My older cat watched as i rolled the ball around to show them that food falls out, he thought that was cool and ate the food that fell out but when I stopped rolling it around he just looked at me and walked away. My other younger cat just watched and then walked away, like he was saying well if you have to roll it forget it.It has sat in the same place for days now, neither one has payed any notice to it since.Cats will be cats and they will not always do what humans want them to do. At least my two don't."
4,"He gets food (and is happy), I get sleep (and am happy)","My cat is hungry all the time. ALL THE FREAKING TIME. But the worst times are when I'm trying to get to sleep at night and before I'm ready to get up in the morning. Luckily, this ball is a big help. He gets his regular feedings in the morning and evening and then he get an extra special snack of dry food before I go to bed. He gets some food to last him through the night and he also gets worn out trying to get the food out of the ball so by the time I'm ready for bed, he's tuckered out too. We both win!Make sure you adjust the size of the holes so that too many pieces don't come out at one or that kinda ruins all the fun and don't go too far the other way too or kitty will be more frustrated than happy. Other than that, this is a great way to give your cat the noms they want whilst they get a little exercise and stimulation."
5,Great Diversion,"Freddy Krueger was driving me crazy, waking me at the crack of dawn wanting food. Plus I had to guard the dog while he was eating because the cat would steal the dog's food too. This device works great to divert the cat. It's well made (I stepped on it and it came apart but was easily reassembled). The only problem I found was the dry kibble I used was too small and the ball smallest opening was too large. I finally found some larger kibble. The unit can be easily cleaned in the dishwasher... be careful not to lose the locking part when you disassemble."
5,excellent,"Bought it as a gift for a friend and its GREAT. One minor concern is that if left loaded at night it might wake you up as you know who starts playing with it in the middle fo the night. But for weekend trips when kitty is alone, it will provide snacks and keep him/her occupied."
3,all photos of paintings in black and white!,"Wyant was a wonderful painter, and the text is interesting ...the quality of the pictures is OK, but all in black and white? I was disappointed! The poetry of his work still comes through."
5,"Packaged well, item pictures are inadequate","I wish I would have taken a picture of this before giving it as a Christmas present last year, but alas I did not, so you still don't know what it really looks like.Would it kill the seller to put a picture up?That being said, it looks like the picture and the colors are official orange and blue. I don't remember how thick the material is."
4,Pain take that,I loe all of the products this company makes. I put on gloves to rub the gel into my aches and pains. the gloves allows me to get a good massage into that spot. I use this gel specific for my neck pain. As you rub it in the gel gently warms up that pain and makdes it bareable.
4,Salonpas Gel,Does provide relief from pain but there is still no miracle cure. This is the best product I have been able to find for back and neck pain relief.
3,not one of their best,"I have all the old Windham hill Christmas CDs, & the new ones just arent' as good in my mind. But it's ok...I definitely can keep it in the CD player."
4,Good Windham Hill Collection,"Ordered this CD as a gift and it is an older CD, produced many years ago. I was very glad to find it on Amazon and was able to order it through them. It arrived well within the alloted time frame and was very well packaged. Amazon continues to be one of my favorite places to shop... Thanks much, EP"
4,pretty good,"It smells like toilet cleaner, very strong. I'm not a fan of the smell. but it does a good job at keep my dog's ears clean. (minus one star because my dog doesn't like it.)"
5,Best ear cleaner,"I have tried other ear cleaners, but I find this the best. Not as drippy as others I have tried."
4,Helped my dog's ear smell,"Bought this for our mini schnauzer. She had a bad smell in her ears. We bought the r-7 powder that helps remove some of the ear hair, and this to clean them and the smell is almost gone. I'm not sure it will ever go away, but this definitely helped."
1,Stateboard kid 2,This movie is soo cheesy and soo boring it should be called the State Board kid 2. It would be about a kid who gets a magical stae board who can talk. Also the acting ... because the kid has a smile as bad as the movie itself..
3,i/thought/it/was/an/exciting/video/about/a/kid/and/his/famil,ANDREW/KEGGEAN/IS/SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO/CUT
1,A Masterpiece!,"This dramatic masterpiece of a movie is a very touching story about a kid and his magical skateboard. Although sometimes it can be gory, it can be viewed by everyone except elderly people (violence). I would say this movie is better than Citzen Kane."
2,This movie is the funniest one I've EVER SEEN!!!,"All that can be said about this movie is that the kid is supposed to be 13 but he is about 9 in real life by the way he looks. And the skateboard, the characters and the plot even were really really cheesy. But, since it is soooooo fake, it is one of the most hilarious movies I have ever watched."
5,THIS ALBUM RANKS AS MY ALL TIME MANILOW FAVORITE!,"IT'S UNUSAL TO BUY AN ALBUM AND LOVE EVERY SONG BUT THIS RELEASE IS THE EXCEPTION. ALONG WITH THE HITS ""LOOKS LIKE WE MADE IT"" AND ""WEEKEND IN NEW ENGLAND"", I LOVE THE STUDIO EDITION OF ""DAYBREAK"" AND THE SONGS THAT FEATURE HIS PIANO PLAYING: ""SEE THE SHOW AGAIN"", ""ALL THE TIME"". I ONLY WISH THAT ARISTA WOULD RE-RELEASE THIS ONE AS A MASTERS SELECTION WITH A BONUS SONG!"
5,Down Memory Lane...,"My poor old Barry albums are in a dark corner of a back bedroom where I don't think I can even get to them any more. So I have been slowly replacing them with CD's. I remember mooning over his cute face and feeling like crying over Weekend in New England. It's right back to the sad, lovely, lonely and yearning days of my first love, Barry love. Every song goes straight to the heart and is sung to me alone. That's his real magic. Get your heart back! Remember love?"
5,WHAT!!!@You a'int got it???!!!!,"Go no further in the saga that is Barry Manilow....GOT TO GET THIS.This is essential Manilow.Songs that have a story to tell,songs that are romantic,songs with a flash of fire that only HIS perfect tenor can convey in a rush of potent melody.....#sigh#......Gifted man,indeed."
4,"Nice, but scratched","The trash can I received was in good structural shape and quality, but the can I received had some pretty good scratches on it. It was like someone put it on the floor on its side and dragged it a little ways. Other than that, nice can."
3,"Nice trash can, bigger than you think","This is a very nice trash can. It's bigger that you think, durable yet flexible. It's a nice color and light weight."
5,Rubbermaid Commercial Soft Molded Plastic 10.25-Gallon Trash Can...,Looked just like advertised. It arrived when they said it would and was packaged well. It was a good price too.
2,Don't waste your money,"I could've went to the 99c store ant got a bigger trash can than this for a quarter of the money I paid for this thing. It's a regular, black, SMALL trash can. Like the ones they have in some offices...but smaller. Don't waste your money, please."
4,"Good for a bedroom, living room","This trash can is the perfect size and design for a kitchen or bedroom, but definitely too big for a bathroom and too small for a kitchen. It's a great run-of-the-mill trashcan, similar in size to what most classrooms have inside them."
3,"Good price, not what I wanted","This was a good price on these items, however maybe I missed something in the information page because I thought I was getting the black/brown cans. Much to my surprise when I opened the box and they were beige. Again, maybe I missed something."
5,"Sturdy, cheap.","If you're looking for a trashcan(without lid), this is the best one. I've searched far and wide- in all possible online stores. This turned out to be the best option"
3,Didn't fit under my counter,"I bought this to fit under my kitchen cabinet, but it didn't fit so now I use it for my recycling. Nice neutral color, can't go wrong with it."
4,Your basic black plastic trash can at a good price,"Exactly as expected, your basic, black, plastic trash can. It has a slight bit of residue form the manufacturing process, and dust from the packing/shipping, about typical for these sorts of things. I washed it out and off and let it dry and it was fine. Looks to be of good quality and will get the job done."
5,"Brilliant, fast to read, loaded with probing questions","Brilliant book. No baloney. Loaded with questions every businessperson should be asking about his/her business. I never heard of Kelly before; now, I've recommended the book to 2 people and suggested that a third consider going to work for Kelly. It's a fast book to read -- stimulating the reader to think about critical ways to improve any business."
1,you have been warned .... lisa gerrard is not on this cd,"i purchased this cd and anxiously awaited it's arrival in the mail to hear lisa's soothing vocals. much to my disappointment, i found that dreamgate does the vocal track ... lisa gerrard is not involved with this ep in any way"
5,Track List,1. Now (All Through The Night)2. Hot Shot City3. School's Out4. Let This Love Begin5. Burning up the Night6. Say Goodbye7. World on Fire8. Hard Luck Hero9. Long Way From Home
2,The end for Krokus?,"""Change of address"" is nearly pop metal. On this one Krokus is much more polished than on earlier efforts and it's sad to say but the material is rather weak. A song like ""Let this love begin"" have we heard a million times from ""pop-metal-hair-bands"" like Bon Jovi or Cinderella. It follows the blue print for the ballad every metal band at the time had to include on their albums. The cover of Alice Cooper's ""Schools out"" is okey and so is ""Hard luck hero"", but the highlight is ""Say goodbye"" - a song very similar to their own ""Tokyo nights"" some years earlier.Take my word, this album is not worth 4 stars. Buy ""Hardware"" instead!"
5,A perfect trainer,I have worn the Asics' Kayano for three years now after switching from the Nike Triax series. The difference has been unbelievable. The minor injuries and pains that I experienced with Nike shoes have gone away and I no longer have to worry about air pockets bursting. The gel cushioning combined with great support and foot guidance systems makes this a durable shoe perfect for high mileage runners. Asics has really improved this shoe with the release of the new VIII. It is now lighter with adjusted support in the mid foot area making for an even more comfortable run without losing the durability. There are plenty of reasons this is Asics' flagship trainer.
5,Good series book has become better with XI version,"I have acquired and am using the current version (XI) of the ""Using Crystal Reports"" series book and I am impressed. I am a seasoned business-savvy IT professional and this book has helped me create useful reports with some of the advanced product features like sub-reports, variables, formula manipulation, parameter passing, advanced formatting, etc.The author team has evolved the chapters to stay abreast of new features and Business Objects APIs. They have also clearly spent a good deal of time editing this version as the chapters flow together better than the previous versions and the real-world samples are particularly improved (and useful).The book is not perfect and is lacking detailed coverage of all of the Business Objects Enterprise, Crystal Reports Server or Crystal Reports RDC APIs but the existing coverage is very insightful and I'm not sure I could carry the book if it had many more pages."
4,A Solid Reference - But Poorly Organized,"This is a solid book and a worthwhile reference. Unfortunately, the content organization is somewhat confusing--and the sheer size of the book makes it fairly difficult to find what you're looking for.The contents have so many hints and tips that every programmer will learn something. I've been using Crystal Reports for many years, and reading through the book I would frequently learn little tips or timesaving processes.I might note, however, that several of the examples are specific to certain database platforms or certain report implementation methods. For example, I didn't have easy access to SQL Server while reading the book, so testing out some of the examples was nearly impossible.Nevertheless, one of the best Crystal Reports XI references available on the market."
1,BRUCE BRUCE Platinum Series,"I had viewed a Bruce Bruce show on Comedy Central recently so I thought that this DVD would be even better. I was wrong. While there are a few funny moments, most of it is pretty lame. He spends a great deal of time picking on people in the audience. While this may work well for the live audience, it does not translate well to the TV viewer. Also, from a technical angle, the lighting of this concert is bad. It almost seems amateur."
2,ALL THE FUNNY MOMENTS ARE SEEN IN THE FIRST 20 MINUTES,"OF COURSE, BRUCE BRUCE WAS FUNNY WHEN HE WAS ON COMIC VIEW, BUT THIS DVD IS VERY MEDIOCRE. JUST ABOUT ALL OF THE FUNNY MOMENTS ARE SHOWN EARLY ON IN THIS DVD. AFTER ABOUT MAYBE THE FIRST 20 MINUTES, IT JUST GOES WAY DOWNHILL. I THINK BRUCE BRUCE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A FAMOUS COMEDIAN, BUT I KNOW HE CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS! EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE A FEW LAUGH OUT LOUD MOMENTS, THIS SHOW DEFINITELY NEEDS SOME WORK. MAYBE NEXT TIME, BRUCE'LL COME OUT WITH A DVD THAT'S MUCH FUNNIER THAN THIS."
4,Bruce Bruce,Now I have seen Bruce Bruce a ton of times on BET and I've heard him on radio being interviewed. He's a very funny guy. I saw this DVD earlier than the average public fan with my urbanworks hook up. It's pretty dope. He covers new ground and as always he's a classy guy on stage. I definetly dug it and I think you will too. It's a stomach holder fa sho.
2,"gameplay -- no marks, story -- no marks.","Really, am I the only one who felt that the game had severe storyline issues on top of the terrible mechanics? The plot itself was bizarre and incoherant, and the additional characters they added to make it run were completely flat and uninteresting, even by video game standards. One in particular -- whose name I shall not name out of respect for spoilers -- was enough in one package to flush out any interest I might have had for the story. As a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist, I hated this game. As a fan of fighting and roleplaying games, I hated this game. As an excuse to waste a few days laughing at the dialogue and the general WTFness of some of the scenes, I admit that it had its moments... but not enough to justify buying it."
4,Transmuting the Broken Angel,"I had a lot of fun with this game! I loved the music, the graphics, the story. I was able to figure out the controls pretty quick, Wish Al was more cooperative. Only con for me is I had it beat in 20 hours."
4,cool,if u love the show FULL METAL ALCHEMIST then you will love the game. but the story lines is a littie diffieret then the show but it works. lol! i also recomed the FULL METAL ALCHEMIST 2 game. fun fun funfun.....
3,Alchemy!,"I love the voice overs! I think it's great they kept the same voices from the Anime.*cough*Well anyway, this game is pretty fun. It's impressive how you can focus a park bench into like... a javelin or something. That's one of the main things that gives the game it's edge.It's real time battling can be pretty intense. You could be surrounded by multiple enemies and beaten to a pulp in no time.The story line is so-so from what I played (I haven't finished it yet). I wish they would make that more interesting. I mean, that's what give me the motivation to actually PLAY the game.One thing I didn't like was it was too easy to get stuck. The dungeons were confusing; you could take a million turns and STILL not get there yet. Another was you simply don't know where to go next.I'm going to have to read a walkthrough for this game... but I'll finish this game someday."
3,"I was sucked in by the title, but other books offer more","This book is a good idea, but even the standard Moon handbook has more hidden out of the way stuff than this one. It's more like a series of essays than a comprehensive guidebook, so you can't turn to a specific area or a specific topic, other than the essay titles. It's best as a guide to restaurants, shops, bars, and coffeehouses, but there are much better ones if that's what you are really after. Everything is treated too quickly to really give the reader a good idea what they are getting into.I remember one thing in the Hollywood chapter they pointed out was the Pink Dot, a convienence store that delivers. I ""had to"" go visit it, thinking it was a famous landmark, but it is really just one of a chain of mediocre conveinence stores. I have no idea why it made it into an ""underground"" guidebook."
1,product was old and discontinued,the product was old and discontinued 5 yrs ago. would not recomend use. color does not come out. would not recomend
2,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT.,"WELL HONESTLY, THIS REVIEW IS NOT BASHING THE SELLER. TRUTHFULLY I AM VERY PLEASED W/ THE SELLER. IT ARRIVED VERY FAST,SO I WILL ADMIT I WAS HAPPY WITH THAT.ON THE NEGATIVE NOTE. THE HAIR COLOR THAT SHOWS UP IS NOTHING LIKE IT LOOKS ON THE BOX. ONCE AGAIN THIS IS NOT THE SELLERS FAULT. THEY DONT MAKE THE BOX OR ADVERTISE IT, CLAIROL DOES. I EXPECTED TO HAVE BURGUNDY HAIR. BUT...WELL..NO I GUESS IT WAS WISHFULL THINKING. IT TURNED OUT DARK BROWN W/ A SMAL RED TINT THAT CAN ONLY BE SEEN IN THE SUNLIGHT. SO THERE, ITS NOT BURGUNDY. DONT WASTE MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.ONCE AGAIN I WAS PLEASED W/ THE SELLER. THIS IS NOT THIER FAULT."
4,"a fine book, but...","Philip Gabriel's translation seems distinctly sub-par. I don't read Japanese, but I would assume that Murakami doesn't write as clumsily as some of _South of the Border..._ comes off as. What happened to Jay Rubin and Alfred Birnbaum, two excellent translators? Despite that, a fine book. I wouldn't say it's Murakami's best, but it's excellent by any measure."
3,Meh,"Presents a bleak message about how society traps individuals into the roles they play and paths they take, to the extent dreams are lost. For the occasional individual who still clings to it, the price is high. Theme resonates in eastern societies where responsibility for others trumps the pursuit of individual happiness.The translation felt funky. The translator took liberties to americanize the lingo, which felt much too gregarious to present the atmosphere of Japan, whereas the original language probably conveyed the nuances (such as showcasing the differences during casual interactions with a classmate or father-in-law. Portraying those convo's in the same tone is not okay). Having those contrasts of the formal reservedness and personal rebelliousness would have been helpful."
2,Unremarkable,"Usually a book evokes some sort of reaction in you whether it be minor or major, but I was surprised to discover a book so unremarkable I was left with no reaction at all. The simple writing style I found quite dull, though I suppose his technique might have been lost in the translation. As for the story, it's a nice enough idea - pining for something you can't have - but you need a fair deal of tension and evocative writing in order to convey the anguish of lost love, and I'm afraid this book just doesn't have it. I've read the other reviews and many other people have commented that a) this is one of the worst of the author's works and b) that the story has many loose ends. Well, I haven't read many of his other books so I can't comment on his talent as a writer, but it is true that the story has many loose ends. However, you care so little for the characters you don't care about the unexplained aspects. Easily forgettable."
1,Very disappointing,"I read the Wind Up Bird Cronicle and absolutely adored it. I couldn't wait to read another masterpiece from Murakami but all this book left me with was an empty feeling. I will give him another chance to impress me though as I have just ordered ""Hard Boiled..."""
4,Reviews from Brizmus Blogs Books,"I love Murakami's writing style and the way he always manages to turn a slightly boring character that one would rarely ever think about into something fascinating and almost always strange. This book isn't any exception to that, and I loved it for everything it was, and there was nothing missing from it. It's just so hard, though, not to compare it to everything else I have ever read by him, and because of that, I just can't give it the five stars it perhaps deserves."
4,First love,"The main character, Hajime, forms a strong bond with Shimamoto when they are both 12 years old. He looses track of her and continues his life. He continues to look for her while he develops his life. They finally have the opportunity to get together, but he would have to throw everything away to be with her. The story has an interesting conclusion. As with other Murakami books there is a lot of reference to music. Murakami examines the dimensions of love in this book."
4,Not what I expected,"I read this for a book club and I really enjoyed it. It was a little strange, a little risque, but also a simple story. It was an easy read with characters that seemed real and not caricatures of real people."
3,"Not bad, but he's done better","The least pleasing of his works that have been translated. Compared to the Sheep books, Norwegian Wood, and Wind-Up Bird this is lightweight. I didn't get the sense of ""all is not right in the world"" that I usually get from a Murakami book. This is not to say it is a bad book. Just for HM, it isn't his best."
3,it's more than you think it is,"I was surprised at the lack of crazy, wierd, jigsaw-like elements that there were in his last books. But, you can't expect a writer to do the same thing over and over again, no matter how excellent it is. At first I was disappointed, and I would have agreed that it was a boring trashy and unoriginal love story. But, I couldn't really accept that. I mean, he's just too good to do something like that. This story boils down some of the things that exist in his other books, in a harsh and unapologetic way. The main character is unlikeable, it's true, but neither is he dispicable. Murakami is just very, very subtle. It's a story of the ordinary,mediocre, and well-intentioned. And, who among us really lives like the characters in his other novels?"
1,"Hey, where's the rest of it?","Frankly, this is only half a book. Too many plot lines are left unanswered. I'm all for some things being left to the reader's imagination, but hey, throw me a freakin' bone here. Basically this is a bit like an autobiographical apology for some indiscretion on the author's part dressed in the thinnest of plot shells. Consign this one to the Barbara Taylor-Bradford catalogue. Next please, Mr Murakami!"
1,NO Kindle edition :(,I am very disappointed to find out that a Kindle edition is only available to UK Customers only !!!!!!!!!Although I am sure that this is an excellent Book I will have to give it one star for the omission..... am really disappointed.
3,Unforgettable adolescent love.,"The theme of this book is universal: a man who cannot forget a youth love (Dostoyevsky, Turgenev, Fournier ...).When the main character of this book sees his ex-girlfriend back after two decades, the smouldering emotion becomes a real obsession. He wants to leave everything else behind him to begin a new life with her.The story is told in a very simple poetical captivating language, now and then abruptly cut by physical ... outbursts.But some aspects are flawed: the link love-death (he 'saw' the death in her eyes), the mystery surrounding the real life of his ex-girlfriend and the rather easy end.I found that this book had not the intensity of 'The Idiot' by Dostoyevsky or the truly surprising plot of 'First Love' by Turgenev."
1,Murakami channels Danielle Steele,"There is nothing new about this plot and the writing style is not engaging (? blame the translation?). A quick read, but more suited to the beach in summer, and not literature.Symbolism is heavy-handed. His life is the desert, and Shimamoto is water. She only appears in his bar when it rains. The author feels the need to point this out to the reader.When Hajime's wife discovers his infidelity she earnestly proclaims that she only wants him to be happy, and if he wishes, he can take everything, even their children. Right. Even cultural differences do not allow for this over the top male fantasy to be credible.I don't understand why this book has been so well-reviewed. Maybe it is a romance novel written for men. Guys--there's lots of this stuff out there."
1,"hopefully, it was just filler","Three things draw me to Murakami's works: 1. his beautiful prose, simplistic yet flowing 2. his dreamlike plots 3. his fatalistic characters<i>South of the Border</i> is bereft of all these traits, or rather displays them in an alarmingly facile manner. Earlier works like <i>The Wind Up Bird Chronicle</i> and <i>The Great Sheep Chase</i> (esp. the former!) were the kinds of books that left me thinking about the characters each time I put them down, sometimes even causing me to feel like my reality wasn't quite... real (you know that hyperrealistic feeling you get when you've immersed yourself in an engaging story that's set far outside of your normal purview). This one left me thinking, ""If this is what we can expect from Murakami in the future, it's time to move on to another author."""
4,A Classic Murakami,"This is a wonderful book. By my opinion, however, not his absolutely best. I still vote for Norwegian Wood as the best book to start with, but you will soon want to move on to this work"
3,not quite as good as his others,"Murakami is the master of unattainable love. But the Sheep Novels and Norwegian Wood are better at getting to bottom of that emotion than this slim novel. Murakami fans will still want to read it (it is by no means BAD, just don't expect an epic), but if you are considering this as your first Murakami reading, I suggest you take a look at his other works first."
5,Haunting...,"While considered by many Murakami afficiandos to be one of his lesser works, it remains one of my favorites. True, it lacks much of the wackiness we've come to expect from Murakami, but the end result is no less surreal. Like ""Norwegian Wood,"" this novel is, at times, very emotional, but it has a deep psychological element that NW lacks. Like ""Hard-Boiled,"" this novel depicts a mental struggle being carried out in the protagonist's mind - it's just more subtle. I think this novel will resonate with many men, especially those of middle-age. For all readers, however, this novel will invariably linger in your mind long after you finish it."
2,Eh...,"Certainly not his best work. I want to say it was enjoyable enough, his writing style did come through, but in retrospect it really wasn't all that engrossing. This one I should have gone down to B&N Brick and Mortar to review first."
4,So different and so Murakami,I loved it very much but this book was very different from his other books.As usual in his writing its a book that makes you think but its a relatively light reading.
3,Buggy,"This program is like an inconsiderate lover, it always wants to be on top. If you're trying to follow along with the tutorials in AE, you have to minimize and then maximize AE to get it to stay on top. After a while it becomes a big nuisance. That being said the tutorials are pretty good. They'll give you a good basic understanding of AE."
2,"Ok ring, but disappointing stone.","The ring I received was finely polished,and looked exactly like the one in the picture......except for the stone. The stone looksabsolutely NOTHING like the stone displayed.Where that one in the picture was a dark blue,I received a ring that had more of a baby blue stonewith a black strain through it.I was very disappointed."
5,great hairspray,"This product works very well on my hair. I have very fine hair and other sprays are to heavy,and become ""sticky"" in humidity. This one dosn't leave a sticky film. Does not dry out hair and give that dull appearance after daily use.This product gives your hair a nice shine and a healthy appearance,and holds all day long.I am hooked on this product!!Not always easy to find! Glad to see they have it here on Amazon.com."
2,Even RUTGER HAUER can't save this lame script...,"*Lying In Wait* I'll spare you all the boring details of a long and drawn out review. BAD ACTING, BAD SCRIPT = BAD MOVIE. The main characters are terrible actors and the story is worn out and boring. I would pass this one, even if it's free. Your time is worth more than that.I give it 2 THUMBS DOWN and THE FINGER!"
2,Rutger Hauer,"What else is there to say, other than Rutger Hauer. Has he ever been in a good movie, other than the Hitcher? I didnt expect much, and that's what I got."
2,Only on a deserted island,"When my automobile died on the way to Kingman Arizona, I was left with two days to wait for its repair, and nothing to read. This book fell into my hands so I read it, though the person who gave it to me said ""It's not very good."" Alas, I must agree. The book has a very large number of incomplete sentences, as well as an annoying number of complete sentences that do not make any sense. In other words, the book could have used a better editor. On top of that, the characters in the book are rather poorly fleshed out: they are rather cartoonish, paper-thin, cardboard cut-outs and none of them stand out as remarkable or even rememberable. To tell the truth, it required an act of will to finish reading the book: several times I resisted the urge to give up.If left with nothing to read, I would read this book. If given the choice of several books to read, I would skip this book."
5,Very Satisfied,"I bought the hearing protection to use at the pistol range. I works very well, you can carry on a normal conversation but it still blocks the report from shots being fired around you. I highly recommend it for anyone who shoots at a range."
2,"Turnning Peltor Tactical Sport ""on"" or ""off'","I have not used my Peltor Tactical Sport noise cancelling earphones for some time. After replacing the bateries, I don't remember how to turn the device on or off! There is a small rubber embosed on/off symbol on the side of one of the ear pieces adjacent to the volune plus and minus buttons. Pressing that (on/off) button seems to do nothing. There is no indicator like a light nor is there any apparent change in the sounds heard through the ear phones. I can't tell if I turned it on or off. I need some help. Incidentally, my Peltor model does not look like the current illustrations of the product. I probably have an earlier model."
5,Peltor Tac 7 Hearing Protection,This is my second set of this product. Works great and I'll buy a 3rd set when these go dead.
5,Great Ear Protection,This product was recommended by Front Sight. They know what they are talking about. Excellent product. More than met my expectations. Turn the gain up and you can even hear the gravel rustle under people's feet not to mention clear range commands. Does an excellent job of blocking the loud report of firearms. Battery life is excellent. The battery lasted well beyond my four day range experience even when I forgot to turn the head phones off at the end of each day.
3,OK Cleaner,"After being dissatisfied with the cleaner sample included with my ceramic top range, I tried ""Weiman Glass Cook Top Cleaner."" While it was better than the cleaner I had been given...it is far from the best. If you already have this product, the best way to use it is to dab it on the spot to be cleaned and let it sit for about a minute before you start rubbing...and if that doesn't work the first time...repeat.A far superior product is ""Bar Keepers Friend."" It does not take nearly as much time or elbow grease as the other products I have tried AND it is a multipurpose cleaner that cleans my stainless steel pans that I thought were past redemption.I do like ""Weiman Cook Top Wipes"" for a quick cleanup of minor spots, spills and grease."
5,Best product by far,"I had been buying Weiman's for a long time as I have a glass top counter-top stove and I loved it. Then for some reason I was having a lot of trouble locating the product at our local stores and so bought another brand. It was awful. It left the stove top smeary and no amount of rubbing would make the surface look good. I finally went on the internet and found Weiman's, ordered it, and I am now a happy stove-top cleaner again. Weiman's is a great product and my over-all ordering experience was very, very pleasant."
5,"Works great, especially with the company's matching sponges","We got this a few days after we got our ceramic cooktop because it was dirty. I thought I had already scratched the surface with a cast iron griddle, turns out it was just caked on food and easily removed with this stuff. My cooktop shines so much I can see my pretty face in it."
2,Too Quiet,I'm a big fan of the firm videos but this one never get's played because the volume of the background music is barely louder than a whisper. If you don't mind working out without music buy it; otherwise steer clear.
4,video review,"I like this video but it is challenging. Not my favorite yet but there is potential. Well choreographed as all The Firm videos. Alison is a great leader, excellent cueing. Lower impact moves are demonstrated and just following those gives a great workout too."
3,"Great workout, not so great accessory","I love the firm workouts and this is one of my favourites. But I wasn't too impressed with the resistance loop. Sure, it's free, but I noticed after doing the workout around 10 times that it was getting thin in a couple of places, and then eventually it snapped. I wasn't over-stretching it or doing anything more with it than what was instructed in the video. I'd prefer to pay a bit more for the set with a loop that lasts a bit longer! Now I have to go out and buy my own loop."
5,Another Great Firm Workout,This is another firm workout I ordered when I got the firm kettle bell and exercise dvd. I really enjoy the use of the band and weights combined. I can see a difference in my body tone and my abs or getting definition. This is a great workout for anyone. Shipping was very quick.
2,Can't figure out all the fancy-footwork dance moves!,"I am not new to total body workout classes. I work out an hour or more daily, most days are total body workout classes or DVDs. I've tried this one about 6-7 times and find it extremely frustrating due to all the fancy footwork. The instructor changes the moves quickly too, and doesn't explain the move, just jumps into it - both arms and legs. She has some fancy terms for her moves, and if you're a dancer, they may be familiar. I never took dance other than ballroom, so perhaps that is why I cannot figure them out. Too bad there is not a tutorial on all the dance moves as a bonus feature, because the workout moves are way too fast to learn them. I never thought of myself as uncoordinated until I got this DVD. I wanted to get a workout, but I feel like half the time I need to run in place because she loses me - NOT because I am not fit enough. I don't recommend this video to people unless they are trained dancers."
3,I like it!,"I liked the DVD, the band is a little tight. Worth the purchase. Another good one from the firm. Try it!"
4,Good workout,"This is a pretty good workout. As with all workouts, the more effort you put into it, the better the workout. It's more of a beginner to intermediate level, but does the job and gets most muscles. I suggest interspersing with other exercise activities in your weekly routine."
4,Essential for every exercise DVD library...,"I won't lie: This work out was difficult to figure out the first couple times I used it. However, by the third time I began to master most of the footwork. Now that I have mastered the footwork I find this work out to be fun and exceptionally effective. That said, if this work out has a weak point it would have to be the sculpting segments that employ the use of the band and light weights. It just does not do a lot for me. However, I do believe that the cardio and strength training segments blend well together. Nonetheless, I do believe interval training, which is essentially what this is, is highly effective. I also believe that everybody needs at least two days of intense strength training a week. For that I prefer Jari Love's ""Ripped & Chiseled"". If you are looking for a well-rounded work out then this one is the one for you, especially if you are intermediate or advanced."
3,"Not my favorite, but still good.","I am a HUGE Firm follower. This is definitely not my favorite. There is lots of jumping. I am okay with the occassional jumps or leaps within the sessions. With this workout, it seems like every cardio session had jumping that I found to be a bit jarring. All that said, it will give you a good sweat. And I enjoy Allison immensely as an instructor. Her cues are clear and her energy is always at a perfect level."
3,"great calorie burn, but my least favorite FIRM workout","I am a fan of The FIRM. I usually find most challenging and motivating. I also like Allison Davis as an instructor. Dangerous Curves Ahead is definitely a challenging workout because it has alot of jumping and lunging. And the use of the band is also an extra challenge albeit uncomfortable at times. I just found the warm up and the cool down movements odd and uncomfortable. I didn't like the music. Also after several months of using it at least once or twice a week the band broke which is an integral part of the toning segments. And I can't find a way to replace it even through the FIRM website. I do like that you can break the work out in to 3 smaller workouts. I wish more of them did that. The title is weird too. So overall I give it a B-. I feel like I had a good workout after I'm done, I just also feel annoyed with it too."
2,So So Mediocre Movie,"I was disappointed by the movie: The plot was lethargic and implausible and the acting by Roberts was so-so. While it is better than many other B-grade movies, it simply lacked the suspense, drama, set-of-your-pants compellingness to make it a worthwhile film. I would avoid it. A far far better film for the money is A Murder of Crows, one of the best acted and scripted films on this decade."
2,Book: Little O,"Description said some marks in margins. There were crayon marks in the middle of pages. I am 62. I read this book in elementary school and wanted to give this book to my granddaughter, Olivia. :("
5,"A great source for ""comida tipica""","I found this book after I had moved to States from Guatemala in the 90's. It was a God's sent. At the time, I didn't know how to cook anything. I found the recipes easy to follow and the flavors were right on. Copeland Marks goes into great detail about different ingredients and how to get them here in the USA, this section is at the beginning of the book. I was sad that the book could not be found for a while since it was out of print. A lot of my friends wanted one... Now, I have been telling them that they can buy it. It is an absolutely treasure to me."
5,In world of cookbooks this one stands above the rest,"My general love of cooking and love for Latin American cooking led me on a ""if I can only have one"" cookbook search - not that I DO ""only have one"" :-) I wanted something that gave me more than just the usual casual listing of recipes with a liberal sprinkling of anecdotes. Copeland Mark's accomplishes what is clearly a labor of love with this work, in that it is both comprehensive and insightful. Centered around Mayan cooking styles, and yet differentiating sub-cultures within that category by both region and cooking styles, he accomplishes both a study of the modern day Mayan food culture and a great recipe resource. If you love the taste of tamales, tortillas, all formes of carne, and pungent sauces, this book provides an adventure that begins with, and then goes far beyond, the traditional corn kitchen.False Tongues and Sunday Bread"
4,Funny!,"This book made me laugh out loud and it was a great gift for my two sisters for Christmas! I couldn't be with them, but I know they were laughing Christmas morning! Really funny!"
1,Here we go again!,"Another CRAP TRAP! I bought this DVD because it received good ratings from numerous Amazon customers. Thanks again people...I thought it was poorly made, unintelligent, NOT SCARY, NOT creepy, and very drawn out. Based on the reviews you'd think you're getting into a horror/psychological thriller. NOPE, just a shaky film with little to no gore, and a bunch of nonsense. What a waste of my time."
4,Desert Weirdness!!!!,"This is a pretty good movie if you like peyote, the supernatural, and the Mojave Desert; and lets face it, who doesn't?The main idea of this move is that something evil controls people that venture onto the Zzyzx Road in the middle of the Mojave Desert in Southern California. A death and torture cult compound was raided in the Sixties and the leaders supposedly escaped and are still at large. This really has nothing to do with the characters in this movie (unfortunately) but it is an interest premise.The story centers on a Jock and a Nerd, on a road trip to Vagas. They take a side trip at the behest of the Nerd to partake of an experience that is supposted to ""change"" people. During this process, they meet a slick female with an agenda of her own.Most of the scary stuff is shown in peyote hallucinations, that seem to be influenced by some evil force.They is murder, assorted blood shed, and sex; all linked together with an overweight Mexican family."
1,Never again,No longer will I ever view user review's to help determine whether a video is worth paying the money to view or not. Most of the reviews for this travesty were positive and spoke of the quality of the movie despite its budget.I purchased the rental rights and am only happy that the charge was minimal. This is truly a dreadful movie that wouldn't even rate a satirical viewing by the Mystery Science 3000 group.Absolutely dreadful in every respect. This movie has everything a normal human being does not want with the exception of a moderate rental fee.Avoid this movie like the plague.
4,Good solid indie film,"Zzyzx is a very intriguing film. Shot on a very tight budget, this movie seems to leverage its weaknesses and turn them into strenghts by using the shakey camera movement and ambience to create a sense of isolation and weird atmosphere. The story follows 3 unlikely characters who come together in the setting of the Vegas desert under circumnstances that get progressively worse and worse for all of them. It's a classic example of the situation where all hell has broken loose, and through the whole film the viewer is trying to figure out how the characters can manage to get out of there alive.I'd recommend it to anyone who like weird, edgy indie films and who are looking for something that is decisively not mainstream."
3,Burned movie,"The biggest con of this movie is the fact that it's so low-budget and the cameras they used were like old video cameras. That might be the look the director was going for, I'm not sure. Anyway, it didn't take long to get past the low budget quality though. The story is great, the acting does the job, and that chick is bad a**! I LOVE when she sets her rapist on fire....oops, didn't mean to give anything away. Well worth the 1.99 rental price."
4,Wonderful release,"As a big fan of Ray LaMontagne, and blue-eyed soul singers in general, I immediately fell for this CD. I must be the only one who thinks John Mayer is lame- but James has the perfect balance of growl, ""edge"" and emotion in his voice. I kept hearing comparisons to Stevie Wonder's voice, but that didn't fit quite right. After a few more listens- it struck me who's voice James' reminds me of. Terence Trent D'Arby (if he could sing on pitch!)"
4,Great Debut of Soulful singer songwriter,"I read all the hype on this guy and was skeptical that it could live up to it. This is a great disc though for anyone who loves good soulful pop songs. His voice sounds like a cross between Ray LaMontagne (not quite as raspy but with more energy) Stevie Wonder and Terence Trent D'Arby. The music is a perfect blend of old-school keyboards and horns without being overtly retro. It will appeal to fans of Van Morrison, Marc Broussard, Josh Kelly, Gavin DeGraw, Maroon 5 and more recent Jonny Lange. There's not a bad song on it. He's not that much like James Blunt (as some say) but he may reach the same cross cultural/cross generational audience and be one of ""the"" discs to buy this summer."
5,Music Review,Best CD I have heard in a long time! I bought this because I heard and liked a song on the radio. I love every song on the whole CD! What a bonus.
5,undiscovered genius,"beautiful rusty voice.life experience lyrics.Will not getting you dancing but sure will get you thinking.i love the:""i'm not lost just undiscovered"" part."
5,Solid CD,"Really good CD. Like a more poppy version of Ray Lamontaigne. Definitely worth checking out a few of the songs to see if you like the style. If you do, then you will like the whole CD. I think this guy is really talented."
4,Found by accident on You Tube,"My brother's name is James Morrison And I was looking around on You-Tube with his name for the search and I found this James Morrison with the song ""This Boy"". I liked the Song, so I bought the CD on Amazon. Now I like the CD alot. Anyway chek out his stuff on You-Tube, it's good English lite soul."
2,Case was useless,Bought this cd for my daughter. I thought I was getting a new cd when I ordered but when it arrived the case was cracked in multiple places and completely shattered in one corner. Very dissapointing!
2,James Morrison CD,"This CD struck me as somewhat monotonous with several of the songslacking pace and contrast. Although I'm not a huge John Mayer fan,I think his use of volume and voice variation is more sophisticated.Give me a month of driving and listening to this CD, and I mightfeel more of the style coming through that pushed me to buy itafter hearing a sample track.Listening again to Boz Scaggs and Van Morrison might help movethis artist's style to the next level of connection with thelistener."
2,nope,"If your a woman i don't blame you for liking this album. The cd is ok, kinda catchy but its too girly. It sounds like is about to cry in some of the tracks. It's tollerable, but think twice before getting this one."
3,"Good, not great","Kinda reminds me of Elliot Yamin, but with more talent and charisma. Gets better the more you listen to it."
1,This guy needs to take some serious doses of testosterone,"This guy needs to take some testosterone. I mean, any real man would be utterly embarrassed to have a picture of himself like that on an album cover. What the hell."
5,Beautiful Collectoin Piece,"I own this beautiful doll. Her Kimono is stunning as is all the details. Her display case is most beautiful as well, unlike many others. It's so beautiful that you have no temptations to take her out. She's perfectly displayed and safe in her box. She has sat on my Japanese decorative screen since I purchased her in 2005...I have received so many complements on her!"
1,Barbie Maiko,The doll is beautiful. A very nice collectible doll that is no longer being made. A must for a serious Barbie collector. Not worth the asking price right now. Best to wait until after the holidays for the price to come down drastically.
5,Fabulous product,"This facial moisturizer is really wonderful. It's emollient, smells lovely and makes my skin feel supple and well moisturized. I use it in the morning and in the evening. I don't like moisturizer creams that have SPF in them because they irritate my eyes. This one is great."
5,Gripping story. Couldn't wait to read next 5 installments.,Excellent storyline and characters. Visited Cornwall and drove to Sharptor and St Cleer to see where book was based. Look forward to re-reading these books now that I have seen the setting. Thoroughly enjoyable read.
2,Could be better,"My dog was able to take the rubber non slip ring off the dish. Second, I found one in Walmart for less price."
3,I've heard better versions....,"I still know every word of this wonderful musical after 30+ years, but this version leaves me a little disappointed. It sounds almost amateur, and there are one or two voices in the cast that stick out and grate on my ears. That being said, I am still listening to it and it brings back good memories of my own performing days. The music itself is great; I just don't particularly care for this production."
5,Great CD,We totally love this CD. The show has been a part of our lives and now in our children's as well. We had to get a replacement because the teens kept taking our version. I believe this is the best version of the play. Enjoy!
5,The Tallest Candlestick,"""Godspell"" is such an endearing musical. The music is incredibly catchy and memorable, the message is of course positive, and the delivery is excellent -- most of the time. ""Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord"" from its conch shell opening is an utter delight, a joyful statement of faithful expectation. ""Day By Day"" builds joyfully and is such an exquisite statement for trying to live spiritually in a material and sometimes unkind world. ""Light of the World"" rocks joyfully and makes you feel hopeful, ""The tallest candlestick ain't much good without a wick!"" Lamar Alford on ""All Good Gifts"" perhaps leaves a little to be desired vocally, but the song itself is truly wonderful. It's probably time for a remastered soundtrack to be re-released, but this one contains some of the greatest show music about God and faith. Enjoy!"
5,The musical I grew up with.,"I can remember it know, first the foghorn blows from the silence, it blows three times. Then David Haskell starts to sing ""Prepare yee the way of the lord"" then it goes into a big rock moment with the entire cast singing the song, then comes Lamar Alford with a big opera voice that is wonderfully out of place with everyones pop singing. Thats when I know I'm listening to Godspell. My all time favorite show. The whole alubm is full of vibrant songs, like Day By Day, All Good Gifts, All for the Best, Alas For You, Light of the World, Turn Back O Man, On The Willows, By My Side and Save the People are just an amazing mix of pop, rock, and(thanks to Lamar) oprea. This alubm is just a part of my life now as it was in my childhood."
4,Good. Real Good.,"An excellent C.D. The score is overall very good, but By My Side and Day By Day, in my humble opinion, hurt the score. By My Side is pointless and overlong, while Day By Day is pleasent enough, but overlong by about two minutes. Still, I Recommend this C.D. for save The People, On The Willows, and other great songs."
3,godspell-original recording,"i was very happy to purchase this from amazon.com because i am a musician and i have to perform this play. what a great selection you have. i really was not knocked out by the play. i liked jesus christ superstar much more, but thanks for keeping such a great selection. thomas"
5,I like it,my church did Godspell I didnt get to be a disciple but i enjoyed being part of the chorus even if there were 76 other people in in!! I enjoyed doing in and i want to do it all over again and i cant get the songs out of my head
2,Newer recordings are better...,Check out the 2000 Off Broadway Cast which is far superior to this version. Is it me or does Lamar Alford (All Good Gifts) sound like Kermit the Frog?
1,Disservice to a great musical,"I recently saw a community theater production of Godspell for the first time, and I really loved it. I liked the simplicity of the songs, the biblical narrative, and the creative way in which the play was staged. So, I went out and bought the soundtrack. Wow, was I disappointed. I do a little performing myself, and I know my singing is not very good, but I felt like I could easily have been a featured singer on this particular album. The quality is uniformly poor. It's too bad that a soundtrack by an original cast is of such bad quality. I wonder if anyone else has recorded it, and done the musical the service it deserves."
2,Such a letdown,"Don't get me wrong. I love Godspell. I think its one of the greatest musicals ever written. However, this recording lacks too much, partially because of poor recording equipment and a poor transfer from vinyl to CD I'm assuming and partially because a lot of the performers were not professional. Many of Schwartz's beautiful harmonies are lost, and ""All Good Gifts"" is completely destroyed (by the same singer who manages to cover up all the harmonies in the other songs). Stephan is an excellent Jesus, and David Haskel also gives a splendid performance. However, there are many more, much better recordings of Godspell out there."
5,Godspell soundtrack still great!,"After seeing the musical ""Godspell"" at a local college, I was very excited to get the soundtrack. I listen to it the most out of all of my CD's and soundtracks. It has the happy ""Save the People"", the beautiful ""Day By Day, and the sad ""On the Willows."" All of these are meaningful. As some of the other reviews said, I don't know if ""All Good Gifts"" is one of my favorites. Sure the lyrics are good, but I don't know about the guy who is singing it. I think Stephen Schwartz did a great job with the lryics. They are catchy and have alot of meaning about God. This is definitely one to get. The cast fits the songs really well. Thanks Stephen for writing them!"
3,Stick with the vinyl version,"I bought this with the hope of replacing my old vinyl album. The CD does that. It does not, however, sound as good as the original album. The recording engineers tweaked the performances too much and some part the instruments overwhelm the singers and in others, there's an emphasis on getting guitar neck creaks that a good engineer would edit out. My advice: stick with the vinyl version. Play it into a computer and keep it safe. The CD is a fair copy of an excellent album"
4,Godspell-as good now as it was then,"This album which was a huge success in the '70's is just as good now because the message in it is timeless.The album,based on the Gospel according to Matthew, depicts the final hours of Jesus' life. It's entertaining for anyone who likes good soundtracks."
5,DIVINELY INSPIRED PRODUCTION,"just listening to this album once was like having someone read the new testament to me out loud, only in song. also, the catalog on this record is able to intellectualy teach of spiritual things - as well as inspire the soul- via the certainly celestial vocal and instrumental arrangements of these lessons and truths, as reported from the gospels ."
4,Great songs sounding live,"Last year I saw ""Godspell"" at a local college. Right when it started I knew I was really going to enjoy it. The music in it was so good. I decided to buy this CD. When I listen to it I feel as if I am seeing the show again. The band and singers sound so great, not to mention the lryics by Stephan Schwartz, that it is a CD you have to get if you like Godspell. I also enjoyed hearing the original cast from 1971. It has the hit songs on it such as ""Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord"", ""Day By Day,"" and ""All For the Best."" This album definitely deserves at least four stars, because it's one you'll never stop listening to."
2,"""Milk Dud?""","A classic line from a forgettable film. ""The Formula"" (1980) lives up to its title in the worst possible way. George C. Scott and Marlon Brando (who makes the most of his limited screen time) are the only saving graces in this dull excuse for a thriller. Producer Steve Shagan botches the adaptation of his best-selling novel, with director John G. Avildsen unable to salvage the oily narrative mess. Brando's eccentric imitation of Jerry Lewis in ""The Nutty Professor"" is one for the ages."
3,The Formula,"This is a rather mediocre movie,but the final scene with George C.Scott and Marlon Brando is worth the price of admission.It pits humane values against cold-hearted capitalism."
5,A Must Read,"Are you looking for an adventure that takes you to the edge of your seat? If so, then Hello Ms. President is the book for you. This book has it all - mystery, suspense, intrigue, corporate espionage, and romance - all rolled into one. You'll fall in love with the characters of Melissa and Mark as they work together to save Melissa's career and the company she works for. Devin Jeanel does a wonderful job of drawing you into this couple's life and gives you the desire to cheer them on through each step of their perilous adventure. I look forward to reading more of this author's work and so will you."
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"Once again Devin Jeanel has captured the true essence of great writing. His narrative style combined with characters that draw you into their world is amazing! I read the book in one sitting completely unable to put it down until I knew how Melissa's plight ended. Thank you, Devin, for another great book! :)"
3,The holder is nice,After reading the reviews I was somewhat disappointed with the sharpness of the blade...the one I received was actually dull.
1,Disappointed,"Even though I have many knives I purchased this expecting it to be reliably superior. After a few uses it is less sharp than my other knives, does not slice vegetables or fruits well and is quite a disappointment."
5,Greatest knife for small tasks,I have had this knife for many years - kept at my desk to slice fresh fruit. It was so liked by co-workers - someone absconded with mine while I was out of town. So I am back to order several more. The blade stays nice and sharp - easy to clean - and the blade is right sized for small tasks and reduced risk of cutting fingers. I love the cover and knowing that visitors to my desk are protected and blade is not exposed while not in use. Highly recommend this knife!
4,GREAT LITTLE GADGET,"GREAT LITTLE KNIFE SHARP AND HANDY FOR EVERYDAY USE AND PICNICS, ETC.I HAD ONE LIKE IT AND LOST IT SO THIS WAS A REPLACEMENT...I RECOMMEND IT.."
4,Engine Restore,"I am always skeptical about oil additives, then I decided to use Restore in my 1996 Saturn SL2220K miles on it, the first thing I noticed, Increase in the gas mileage by at least 10% or more,I used to add two quarts between oil change now I add only one. The product works really good.the down side, its not cheap compare to other oil additives."
1,Product does not work!,"Supposedly the product restores your engine's performance by filling in the scratches of your engine and restoring the compression in the cylinders. I wanted to try this product, so I tested my engine's compression before and after using the product. The 4cylinder engine has 160,000 miles on it. Guess what? The numbers were exactly the same if not a little lower (higher numbers are better)! My MPG also did not change. Proceed with caution if you are considering this product."
5,"SKY CARVER: entertaining, imaginative, action packed.","SKY CARVER begins slowly and quickly gathers momentum, building up to a speed so fast you don't want to stop reading. Character development, suspense, action, and story line with writing so descriptive you can see what's happening, all meld together to create a riveting tale of budding friendship, nascent and accomplished magic, and good vs evil. I highly recommend it, not only for young adults, but for grownups as well. Fun, entertaining, imaginative, and action packed."
2,"Not sure what kind of ""mood"" this is supposed to enhance","Since there's not a good description of this DVD here, I thought I'd say a few words about it. It consists of a bunch of puppies in a glass box, barking and interacting with each other as puppies do. I think I counted 7 puppies, of various pedigrees, and it appears that it was filmed at a pet store. There's also some kind of background noise that is very distracting... not sure what it is. You are given the option to play some canned electronic music instead of the original soundtrack, which helps.The write-up on the DVD case states that the purpose of this DVD is to enhance one's mood (or something to that effect). I'm not sure what that means, exactly... but if you want to spend an hour watching pupppies play in a glass box, this is your kind of DVD."
3,KATELAND,"HOW MUCH IS THAT DOGGIE?. Im watching puppies at play, in a cage that has a glass window, i think in a pet shop. They are of diffrent breeds. The little doggies seem to be happy, none are fighting. But there is abit of over crowding, there are 9 rather big pups cramped in there, and the cage dosent seem to be very big. The puppy i would like to buy has a fluffy thick coat, a huskie tail, and a lovely cute face. This DVD is alright. Children would love it. And that background noise, i think is a person speaking softly to the little puppies dueing filming. It could be the pet shop owner, or maybe one of the film crew. But that is nothing at all, it never botherd me. Just enjoy these little puppies as they play and romp."
4,Excellent buy!,"This is a wonderful book and a must have for every aviation fanatic. The highlights according to me are the amazing photographs and drawings which bring the Fulcrum to life as never before. The other part that I loved was the reliance on first hand reports by pilots who have flown the Fulcrum or flown against it.The only niggle (which explains the 4 stars), is the lack of hard data, especially comparing the Fulcrum to other fighters eg. F-16. For example, we read that the Fulcrum's turn rate is better, but in the BVR arena, at least with R-27s, it is at a disadvantage- what would have helped are a few simple charts comparing the Fulcrum with contemporary fighters like the F-16, F-18 and Mirage 2000 on these key parameters...for a die hard aviation fan, hard numbers are a must...so they can draw their own conclusions..too much text can be fluff at times."
4,Pretty Good Book for CLSC Test,It's help a lot on my CLSC test. The questions in the book are close to the real test.
2,CCNP Complete Virtural Trainer,"This only a water-down version of the original books. There are not very many animated explainations to explain difficult concepts. It is not as useful as the author has promised. It can only be used as a review tool, but not a main study text."
2,Doesn't match the objectives for ACRC,"It seems as though this book was writen without consulting the ACRC exam objectives. There are a lot of questions regarding IGRP and DLSw. These two topics aren't even covered by ACRC. There are some good questions to help you with your studying, but don't get this book if you expect an accurate exam simulation."
1,Ethical ethical?,"In decades of buying from Amazon this is the first time I have had to return an item that was not only damaged by poor shipping practices (see my images above) but also misrepresented.Misrepresentation:1)Product Features states that 5 ceramic bowls of various sizes are included. No bowls came. ONLY THE MAT.2) Product photo shows assortment of bowls on top of the mat which one assumes represents the item being purchased.This assumption is backed up in the Product Features description. No disqualifier states that bowls are notincluded.Poor quality:1) Mat is thin and flimsy (see photo);so flimsy that folding it in shipping caused damage.2) Mat is definitely not worth almost $7, perhaps $2 if not damaged.I would definitely not recommend this product."
1,Wrong book?,"The above review and the ""look in the book"" appear to be for a different book from the one listed and whose cover is shown here."
1,Race car film is the PITS,"I came across RPM locally in a bargain bin. I thought ""Famke Janssen (of Xmen fame) and fast cars. Its obviously not Gone in 60 Seconds, but probably worth a look."" Oh was I wrong.The acting was BAD from the get go, with actor David Arquette faking his way through the opening scene. His supporting actors, from the villain of the piece to the Interpol detective, do not a thing to redeem this lemon.Other distractions include the plot, which has holes big enough to drive a truck through. The sound is atrocious. At times the dubbed lines don't match the actors' lips. More often, the background noise, or pitiful soundtrack, drowns out the dialogue. I was constantly reaching for the remote trying to compensate. I shouldn't have bothered.Again, I wasn't expecting The Fast & the Furious or Gone in 60 Seconds, just a mindless romp with fast cars and some eye candy. I had to work far too hard at this one. Don't waste your time."
3,Set for cruise control,"RPM featuring the beautiful Famke Janssen and the witty David Arquette is a movie that got buried under the hype of other car heist films of the summer. I did not have high expectations for this film because I did not expect the action sequence and intensity of the summer blockbuster GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS. However, I was not disappointed by the performances of Ms. Janssen and Mr. Arquette. Set mostly in France, this film managed to tickle more than a few funny bones. The two main characters in the film are the best at what they do...stealing cars. They are not in it for the money, they are in it for the adrenaline rush and the satisfaction of out-doing each other. Needless to say, they manage to get themselves into many sticky situations( literally for Ms. Janssen's character). You'll have to watch the film to see if they manage to get themselves out of their sticky predicaments. So set your remote control for cruise control and enjoy this movie."
1,THE WORST MOVIE THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN!!NO DIZZOUBT!,"I just have one word to describe this movie........STUPID! Anyone who can even watch this all the way through must have the bran capacity of an infant! FAMKE JANSSEN, for your sake I hope that you made this movie before your career kind of took off. I mean the mopvie does look old in its 1985 looking technicolor. DAVID ARQUETTE pray that they make a Scream 4 or that you dreamed that they killed you in 3000 Miles To Graceland (which is an excellent action film by the way)! Word to consumer:DO NOT EVER WATCH RPM! THE TITLE SHOULD HAVE A CIRCL>E WITH A LINE DRAWN THROUGH IT LIKE A NO SMOKING SIGN! ANY QUESTIONS?"
3,So bad its good,"For all the folk that were expecting a bargin basement movie that you'd never heard of to be top quality, well, um, you better have a rethink on your expectation list.Now about the movie. Its totally unrealistic. The premis of the movie is that you have two world class car thieves, a super car that doesn't require gasoline, and two uber-rich and powerful evil guys who don't like each other much. One wants the super car, the other is well, you'll have to watch to find out.The cars in the movie are beautiful, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, Lotus... That alone is worth the lost cost of the film. Throw in Femke and well thats a bonus. Yes the movie is stupid and silly, but its also fun if you approach with the correct mind set. This is a B class movie so dont expect much. Given that, enjoy the show. It really isn't a bad movie for sheer stupidity level."
3,Make sure you have kidsplay handbells,The cards are a bit flimsier than they look I guess I expected them to be a bit sturdier. Also they'll only work with the Kidsplay Kids Handbells the colors for others are different. the cords are fine so in that respect they are useful for my special needs 7 year old.
5,Great for use in a group setting,"These cards are great to use in a group setting. I use them with my young music students so they can play chords as they sing. Before I had these cards, I used homemade flashcards made out of construction paper to show the students which bells should ring at the same time. These cards are a much more attractive alternative!"
5,"Light weight, sturdy collar","The collar was exactly what I wanted. Light weight, no chain links to make noise, yet sturdy enough. I went to several pet stores and could not find the nylon choke or the 18"" size. As always, checked with Amazon. Thank you."
5,Bingo! It got us what we needed!,"So my daughter wanted to study abroad her junior year of college... She was a Spanish major, and was looking for the right program in a Spanish-speaking country.By looking through all the various programs in this book, she was able to find a program that offered her a very significant immersion experience... one that offered living with a family (vs. in the dorm w/ other US students), mainstreamed coursework in Spanish at a local university (vs. special courses for US students), an internship with a local organization (vs. coursework-only programs), and an full academic year experience (vs. a single semester).My daughter is currently finishing her junior academic year abroad. It has been an excellent experience for her. Being able to find the right program was worth much more the price of the book. This was an excellent investment on my part."
2,Just......odd,"I've been listening to Ockeghem for over 35 years, from the eccentric instrumentation of Venhoda to the more austere work by the Hilliard Ensemble. I don't know what graindelavoix is aiming for here, but it simply does not sound like Ockeghem. If anything, it sounds like Ligeti. Plainsong is scattered throughout. Since I purchased this a an MP3 download, I have no liner notes to fall back on for an explanation. Frankly, I couldn't recommend this - there may some point to it, but it is wildly unrepresentative of any performing tradition of this type of music."
4,I particularly appreciated the fact that this brand ...,"I particularly appreciated the fact that this brand of moisturizer is noncomedogenic (doesn't clog pores) and has no fragrance, no color. My skin is very sensitive, so gentle is the key. However, it was a little too waxy feeling. It wasn't greasy, but it didn't completely absorb right away. This product would be excellent for a nighttime moisturizer for someone with dry skin who needed extra moisture."
4,The consistency of the moisturizer was just right ...,"The consistency of the moisturizer was just right and I liked that it was unscented. It was great to use prior to applying makeup since it wasn't greasy. It's a bit pricey for the size of the jar; however, a little goes a long way and it would last longer than most moisturizers. I would use this product again."
5,I really like the Zia Moisturizer for dry/sensitive ...,"I really like the Zia Moisturizer for dry/sensitive skin. I have severe asthma and most moisturizers contain fragrances that are a health problem for me, but I'm able to use this product with no problems --Yippee!!! It glides on smoothly and absorbs quickly into my skin without any greasy feeling. In just a few days of use my skin started feeling smoother and softer. I am hooked on this product and recommend it highly."
1,First I'd like to mention that this facial ...,"First I'd like to mention that this facial moisturizer claims that you should """"apply to face while damp with Sea Tonic water."""" If I'd known that Sea Tonic water was required for recommended use with this product, I would have bought it (thank goodness I didn't!) or I wouldn't have ordered this moisturizer. The overall feel of this moisturizer on my face was disgusting. The product didn't soak into my skin and it left me with a feeling of bacon grease dripping from my face. As if that isn't enough, this product doesn't claim to be """"non-comedogenic"""" which is probably why I broke out after using this product. How ironic, since this product claims that it's for sensitive skin. Which I didn't have until I used this product. Still trying to be optimistic about this product, I used it as an overnight foot lotion. The results were average and unimpressive."
2,This was the first time that I've used ...,"This was the first time that I've used a product like Zia Natural Skincare Skin Basics Fragrance-Free Everyday Moisturizer. I didn't like this product. When I put it on my face, I had a tingling feeling. My skin absorbed it right away. It felt like it had a reverse effect. Instead of moisturizing my skin -- it was making it dry. I don't know how it compares to other, similar products because I've never used one, but I won't use this moisturizer and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,"For a daily use moisturizer, Zia Natural Skincare ...","For a daily use moisturizer, Zia Natural Skincare Skin Basics Fragrance-Free Everyday Moisturizer has a surprisingly thick, greasy feel to it. Probably if used according to the directions on skin still wet with Zia Toner it's consistency would be much improved. It is, on the other hand, a very good moisturizer."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"My husband found this mobile and I thought it was so cute and had so many cool features. We buy it, get it home, install it on our daughters crib and it worked for all of maybe 2 minutes. We took it off the crib, the rubber band that makes it spin had come off, so we put it back on and put it back on the crib. Again the same problem. Finally we had enough and stopped using it, but she still liked to look at the fish. So I wait a couple days and try it again. The lights no longer come on, the music plays for about 30 sec. before it turns off, and the mobile still doesn't spin. Oh and the remote NEVER worked, however if you wanted to watch TV in our room you would turn the mobile on and off. Needless to say I wish we would have bought the mobile that went with her bedding set."
4,Great Mobile,"My 3 month old daughter loves this mobile. The music is awesome and the lights are wonderful. I have had no problem with this product. The other reviewers mentioned that the buttons don't work, I have not had that problem. The music on mine plays for 10 minutes so again no problem. I highly recommend it, its a very cute product and well worth the money. I only gave it 4 stars because there is a little grinding noise when you turn on the fish bowl part and the fish swims."
2,Disappointed,"This looked like an excellent mobile with all the right features: movement, neat sounds, fun lights...but unfortunately from the very beginning, the mobile didn't rotate, and after two weeks, the light stopped working. This was a total bummer, but I'm going to try to exchange it for another one because I do like the design of it, as long as it works. However, if another one fails in this or similar ways, I'll have to write it off."
2,worked for 2 weeks,"it's a great interactive mobile, however the music stopped playing after 2 weeks. apparently it's a common problem with these motorized mobiles."
1,Waste of Money,"The good things...the mobile is very cute and I like the song choices.The bad... the mobile broke in less than one week of use! The aquarium sounds feature began making just white noise and wouldn't stop until I took the batteries out. Also, the lights that the mobile projects began to get too dim to notice.I exchanged the mobile and the second one had the same flaws. In addition, the mobile does not turn unless I push it to get it started. The music will play for so long that it runs the batteries dead within about a week, and the batteries are a pain to change because you have to take it off the crib and unscrew the battery cover. During this process, the fish usually fall off of the mobile.I kept the second mobile for looks only. I don't bother using it's mechanical features anymore. Save your money!"
3,It was fun for a minute.,"I saw this at babys r us and immediately fell in love with it and HAD to have it. I read the reviews and they were mostly negative..but I ignored them and decided to try it for myself. Wellll....I have experienced the same dissappointments unfortunately. This mobile is GREAT..and I mean great for the FIRST or SECOND day that it runs and has FULL power. However, after that, the cute glitter doesnt shoot around and move the little fish in the tank anymore...and the lights in the top of the mobile dim and the music gets all distorted sounding. Its really a shame because I seriously love this mobile, its the cutest thing out there. I am really having a hard time deciding whether or not to get rid of it. I know i probably should because I have no idea if it will last since i've only had it for 3 weeks and it already has issues. Pretty pricey too...$40 dollars. Oh ya and my babies like it. =o("
3,Mobile has a mind of its own!,"I bought this mobile to attach to my sons pack and play since the one it came with had to be spun manually. The fish immediately caught my sons eye and he loved the fish tank. Unfortunately the mobile will start to spin and the music will come on on it's own. We will be in another room and I will come out and it's spinning and then it will just stop. It used up most of the batteries in a week! I can only assume that this one is defective, but my son does enjoy it."
1,Piece of Junk!!,"I'm really sorry that I didn't read these reviews before I bought the mobile. I was attracted to the features and the cute fish bowl, and the colors matched my baby's room. However, two weeks after installing it, the fish completely stopped turning. At first I thought it was the batteries, but we changed them and it still didn't work. I'm really disappointed, because my son really enjoyed it. At least the music still works... A real bummer for me is that I bought it in the U.S., and I live in Israel. I threw out the box and the reciept figuring I would never have an opportunity to return it anyway. Now I'm sad that I did that. I really like it though. :( For those of you looking to buy this product, be warned by the majority of these reviews!! Hopefully you won't be stuck with a malfunctioning product like I am."
4,GREAT!,"I LOVE this mobile! It's great, and our son is completely fascinated by the lights and sounds, and the underwater fish!I had a question about the installation. I called the company, and found the service to be WONDERFUL!"
1,Cheap,"We had high hopes for this mobile since it was so cute but I wish I had read the reviews on this previously. About the fifth time we used the mobile, it broke. The the bubbles ceased to work but the rest of the mobile would not turn off. The fish continued to go around and around and in place of music it made a constant grinding sound. Needless to say we returned it."
4,I like it,"I like the mobile, it's awfully cute, and it hasn't given me any problems yet. The only thing I don't like is that my television's remote control can turn the thing on and off. Also, the light show isn't as bright as I thought that it would be. I'm debating on whether or not I should take it back just for that reason alone. After reading all these reviews about the bad mobiles, I'm afraid I'm going to pick up a defected one. So far, though, I like it."
2,"Babies love it, mommies don't!!!","This was the best $40.00 I had spent, until it quit working 5 days after I bought it. The mobile and aquarium worked great, but it stopped playing music. The soothing music is what helped my little one fall asleep. I thought the combination of the aquarium, lights and music were a wonderful idea, and my little guy loved it, unfortunately this product didn't last long. This product saved me a lot of bedtime trouble, just wish it would have last."
1,"~sadly, another *DEFECTIVE* mobile, so another *BAD* review~","we received this mobile as a gift, and it didn't even work the first time out of the box--despite my handy hubby making sure all was assembled okay. we were going to exchange it (thinking we'd had the bad luck to get a defective one)--HOWEVER, given the majority of these (bad) reviews, we got a gift card instead for another mobile. too bad, 'cause it sure looked cute on the box!"
1,TERRIBLE BUY!!! not even worth a star.,"Make that no stars- I am on my 5th one now-I thought it was just a defective one at first but it turns out they are all defective. This mobile was the worst purchase, but my daughter is hooked on it so I keep replacing the broken one every month(or less). The motor breaks for no apparent reason- the fish stop rotating so the main thing the baby is looking at is broken after a few uses. Ive had the same problem someone stated already where the thing wouldn't turn off a couple of times and started buzzing loud, I had to take it off the crib and take the batteries out to make it stop. The main reason I bought this was for the rotating fish and bright lights that accompanied them- but for some reason that is the first thing to break. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
2,Malfunction city,"Although this mobile is very cute, it also does not seem to function very well. The first one I purchased did not rotate at all. I returned this one and now have one that plays no music- but hey, we've got rotation...I will say that the little fish on the base is awfully cute and colorful and seems to work well."
3,How to use this product!!!,We found the same problem with the mobile not turning after a use or two but didn't want to return it as I expected it to have the same problem again. After mucking with it some we found you can regulary get it to work by whacking the top of it sharply. Works every time!!! Now we can use the mobile we like.
1,Worst Baby Buy,"My son loved the mobile we bought to match his bedding; however, it was not battery operated, so we had to keep winding it. We decided to buy him a battery operated mobile with sounds and lights...this is the THIRD calypso mobile we've bought/exchanged. All of them quit working after about 2 or 3 days. The lights dim, the mobile stops rotating, the remote doesn't work, and the aquarium makes a loud rattle. This was the WORST BABY item we've bought."
2,"Baby loved it, until it stopped rotating","Unfortunately I purchased the mobile before reading the reviews. It worked great for about 3 weeks. Then the mobile stopped rotating. We too thought it needed new batteries, but it still won't rotate. When it did rotate, the motor did make noise, but nothing like one of the other reviews. My son loved watching the fish move with the light, but now we'll have to find a different mobile. I'll be taking this one back!"
2,Don't waste your time or $$,"I bought this before our baby was born, so it didn't get much use when I first installed it. Once our baby girl came home, we immediately started using it frequently. It worked for not even a week! The fish stopped turning, but everything else still worked. I took it back, got another one. This one lasted for another week. Now the mobile will ""sometimes"" turn, the music will ""sometimes"" play, and the bubbles will ""sometimes"" work, but never all at once.I got this simply because of the fish theme, but I think I am going to take this one back as well. I saw where the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Line has now come out with a mobile with a remote control. If I am going to spend $40 on a mobile, it better work for more than a week!"
2,It worked great for 7 weeks,"At first it worked great. About 2 months later the top stopped spining. I emailed the company and they are sending us a new swing arm. They admitted to having defected mobiles and are working on the problem. Email or call them, they seemed helpful so far. I hope the new arm works!!! I think the web site is www.dolly.com"
3,Future Buyers Beware!,"When I first saw this mobile I just fell in love with it. The spiral top, the fish bowl, and the cute little fish, my son just had to have it. But I strongly advise any future buyer that wants to buy this mobile to see if you can put it together at the store first and see if it works correctly. The first one I bought worked just fine but the spiral top that was made to spin didn't. I then took the mobile back to the store and the sales associate that I talked to said that EVERY SINGLE ONE they sold has been returned to the store for THE SAME PROBLEM! Now I did get to exchange it and the second one seems to work properly.Now the things that I love: the fish bowel at the base of the mobile is just awsome! My son love to just sit in his bed and watch the fish swim around. I like the variety of song styles to choose from. Now that the top is spinning, at night when I play it before he goes to bed, the top puts a neat ""under watter"" affect on his walls."
2,"I loved this mobile, but.....","...once I got it rigged and turned on the swimming fish feature, it was making this grinding noise. =( I'm really bummed, because there isn't another mobile that has the features that this one does and there also isn't another one I like as well. Not sure what I'll try next. It's absolutely adorable and has fantastic features, but I know the motor noise would drive DH and I both CRAZY, so I'm returning it."
1,"Trust me, this is a cheap mobile","I bought this because it looked really cute in the box. Once you take it out of the box, it is very cheap looking. The arm that swings out is an awful color green, and the fish fall of. Plus it eats batteries, the final straw is the motor stopped turning after 1 month. It is just stupid, although my baby did like it, but I think he likes anything that he can watch.It is very cheap, do not waste your money. If you do decide to try it keep the receipt."
1,This Mobile is really a piece of junk in a pretty package..,"I loved this mobile when I first put it in my daughters crib. It had a great nightlight, music volume, cute little fish and lots of options...Soon it began clicking, which I ignored for a while. Then the cute little light stopped working, not to mention each time I changed my daughter's sheets the little fish would fall off. Then the mobile stopped spinning altogether (but it still clicked!!). The only thing that kept working was the music. If you buy this mobile you will regret it."
3,"cute, but annoying","my one month old loves the fish but yes the motor grinds. it also has a tendency to not turn off. i have had to remove the batteries twice in order for it to stop making this terrible loud humming noise. it has also stopped making any of the sounds it is supposed to make. i don't know, maybe mine is defective???"
1,believe the reviews!!,"i wish i would have read the other reviews before i wasted my time buying this product... i went to the store to buy another mobile that was hightly rated by these reviews and saw this one and decided to purchase it instead...if only i'd known! wonderful idea, horrible product...grinds, doesn't work when the buttons are pressed, just like the other reviewers stated!! not to mention that the volume control has two choices: loud and louder!! i'm on my way back to the store to get the mobile i originally went to get!!"
1,stopped working second day,"My baby loved this and it stopped spinning the second day. I returned it and got a second one, it stopped spinning day one. DO NOT BUY."
2,Don't Waste your money.,"This is not much of a book. The author does general biographies of a lot of famous people and does not give any more information than a fair to good encylopedia would offer.Best chapters are on people like Hoby, who were not well known outside of Texas. Worst chapters are on people like Howard Hughes, Michael Dell and Ross Perot, where lots of biographical material is already available and much better than what she has. Her Ross Perot chapter was almost all taken from the books, ""On Wings of Eagles"". An important moment in Perot's life but only a small part of it.Catchy title that got me to buy it. Wish I had not. I would sell used on Amazon.com but I don't suspect there is much of a way to recoop what I paid for it...."
4,"Groovy, but get the 2-CD collection...","This is a good one, but I recommend the 2-CD Greatest Hit collection instead. :)"
2,McCoo Feature,"Marilyn McCoo outstanding in her greatest performances but album is heartbreaking in that one can see that the Fifth Dimension became a favorite solely because of McCoo's talent and musical delivery - and that it was not to endure as a group. McCoo should've moved forward on her own much earlier in her career - and she might have emerged to more enduring popularity. Still love listening to ""Marry Me, Bill"" and ""One Less Bell to Answer."""
2,Up Up And Asleep,"Ignoring the outrageous hyperbole of the title, this album does actually contain the actual hits of the band. The problem is, the hits (`Wedding Bell Blues', `Up Up And Away' and `'(Last Night) I Didn't Get To Sleep At All') are pretty tepid stuff. Truth to be told, it's pretty generous to consider the band pop soul, they are really no more than a throwback to the pre-rock sound of the 50s Brill Building. Nothing wrong with it if you're over a hundred I suppose, those born in since the First World War will probably be put right to sleep."
4,5th Dimension CD,"The CD arrived quickly and in excellent condition. It was supposed to be a Christmas stocking stuffer for my husband (he's a big oldies fan), but I couldn't wait....he absolutely loves it!!"
2,Not quite,"This works for mild static, but isn't as effective as dryer sheets. Some loads still come out with static. I may switch to Method dryer sheets."
1,Noticeable difference!,"Yes, I noticed a difference... a difference in how a product can magically make my clothes more static-y than ever. I had read other reviews before purchasing and many people had terrific results with this item, but I followed instructions and have been using it for over 2 months now and it just does not eliminate static from my clothes. I had high hopes for the idea behind this product but it is nowhere near as effective as they claim, or even as others claim. Extremely disappointed."
4,Have some fun - Read this book,"I've ben a fan of Juilian May since I read ""Many Colored Land"" quite a few years ago and I'm glad to see that she is still writing after she finished her Galactic Mileiu series.""Perseus Spur"" is a little less cerebral than her last few book, but every bit as good. It also has a less ensemble cast of characters, but that just makes the action go even faster. The first person narratior is the sort of laid back hapless hero that you can't help but like and the plot has plenty of twists and turns to keep you awake.I'm looking forward to the rest of the series."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"I liked the Galactic Milieu series, though I found parts rather hard going particularly the Exiles books which were a little too introspective for my taste. This, however, for me is the best May book so far. Enough of the characterisation without getting too detailed to interrupt the flow of the story, one main character to follow (easier for simple folk like me) and action all along the way. I'm looking forward to Orion Arm."
2,Disappointing from Julian May,"I really enjoyed the Saga of the Exiles. I thought the characters were well developed and the plots satisfying. So I was expecting a lot from this book. I hesitate to criticise what seem to me to be its failings, since it is obviously meant to be light and not to be taken seriously. Certainly it is packed with action and there are some amusing situations. But it has a bit too much of a feel of it doesn't matter what obviously stupid decisions the hero makes, because the writer is on his side, and she'll make everything turn out OK. Oh, and kill off any character who becomes inconvenient, because we can always invent more characters, but you don't need to be sad about them, because they weren't real anyway. I'm not going to bother with the next one."
2,May isn't what she once was,"While this book does have its moments, it have large holes in its logical underpinnings and a rather annoying main character without much depth. Granted the metapsychic rebellion series was a major letdown after the Saga of the Plieocene Exiles, but this is a further step down."
2,Very disappointing,Not much of a book compared to her other series. This is one story I could walk away from.
2,"Weak characterization and head-shaking version of ""faery""","This is basically a spy/intrigue type novel, although it is fairly short, so the plot is pretty simple. That's not so bad, just light reading, but what I didn't like was that the characters are pretty much just paper cut-outs, and worse, the way the various ""supernatural"" races are portrayed is just silly. As far as I can tell, their non-humanity is just a plot device and was given almost no thought. (The names are ridiculous too - Elves come complete with last names of Irish cities like Dublin and Cork; Leprechauns do not, but are named things like ""Ransi Milbert""; and ""Dorton Hraavik"" for the name of a Faery? oh my.)"
3,Fun but not life changing,I found this book ... and was inexplicably drawn to the thinly veiled allagory. It was entertaining. The writer definately has an engaging style but I got the feeling that the writer's world was not fully fleshed out before he began writing the book. The reactions and circumstances seemed a bit forced. There was little character development so there wasn't much resinance at the end. Still it is worth reading ...
3,Entertaining but thin,"This book was well-written, the plot satisfyingly twisty, but the overall characterizations and plot lines were thin. The reader is never really able to identify with the characters, to develop any type of rapport, and as a result the parts that are supposed to be shocking are not particularly effective. It is an enjoyable read, but not worth searching for. It will keep you entertained on boring evening."
2,Do not buy,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter because she loves to sing and dance and it was a really good price. When we receive this she turned it on by hitting the buttons and you could barely hear the music I thought the batteries were low so I changed them, and it didn't do any good. You can't hear the music only if it is really quite in the room and when you sing in the microphone you can't hear it very good either.This toy ended up in the toy box with all of the other toys my daughter won't play with."
3,Glad I only paid $7!!,"It isn't the WORST thing i've bought on here..but agreed, it IS very quiet/hard to hear music & the microphone works great at times, other times we have to mess with it to hear anything.I bought it for my 18 mos old grandson because he was always begging to use his aunties kareoke machine...so for his age, hes pretty happy with it, but have found him ""messing with buttons to hear himself""I wish it wasn't so quiet because it really is cute, bright colors, he loves the buttons & flashing lights...but NOT worth more than the $7 i paid at this time."
2,Should have listened,I bought this for my 4 yr grandson to play with for his summer visit as he loves to sing and perform. I should have listened to the other reviews. There is virtually no sound. He ended up playing with the microphone only and using it to pretend. What a waste.
2,Has a few issues,"My son received this toy as a gift at the end of December. It is now mid-January and we have already had to change the batteries twice. It's dead again, but I refuse to spend anymore money on batteries for it, and have contact the manufacturer for a replacement toy or refund.Aside from the battery issue, the sound is awful. It's nearly impossible to understand what the voices are saying, and the record/play back feature is also garbled.Despite these flaws, my son seems to love it and has enjoyed it. So I had to give it a couple of stars because of that. But from a practical standpoint, I would not suggest purchasing this toy."
3,A toy to last a decade?,"Wowsers, I can't believe how much this puzzle is selling for now. I got this as a present more than a decade ago when I was only ten years old, and it was probably $20-25 back then.Anyway, I still have mine and it has been put together over and over throughout the years. The cardstock buttresses were the first pieces to go, but I don't consider them to be essential to the puzzle. They bend and wear out very quickly, but they were honestly more work than they were worth. When you try to insert the buttresses they tend to make the puzzle itself begin to collapse. Just ignore the flags and buttresses altogether.The puzzle pieces, and I still have every one, have held up amazingly well. The glue is very strong. None of the paper has detached from the foam pieces. Oh, and the pieces are perfectly formed and fit snugly together. It takes just a few fun-filled hours to complete Notre Dame.To make a long story short, I recommend the puzzle, just not the cardstock!"
5,Teenager loves this puzzle,"We ordered this 3D puzzle for our daughter who wanted it for her son who is a Senior in High School (in fact, he is going to be valedictorian for his senior class). She said that he loves to put these puzzles together.He was excited to get it for Christmas.I guess these puzzles take time and concentration. They are funSnertsmom"
2,BABY BLUES,This unnecessary remake of an overrated cult classic fails to provide any genuine scares--it's ultimately tedious and preposterous.The murderous infant is seldom seen and the one time it is seen it's pretty comical. And why doesn't Daddy notice this horrifying baby's teeth and clawlike fingers?Bijou Phillips and PRIMEVAL's James Murray can't be blamed for their bland performances--they've nothing to work with. The ending is as bland as the whole movie. Avoid.
1,All around Terrible,"I will first state that I have never seen the original version so this is based on this movie alone. The acting is terrible, the directing is terrible, the CGI is terrible, the writing is terrible. There is absolutely nothing positive about this movie. Bijou Phillips is a much better actress then this, it looks like she just didn't care. The CGI baby looked terrible when it was on screen which was rare. I wish that I could say anything positive about this movie but I can't. We would all be a lot better off if all the copy's of this movie were put into a bonfire and we just never spoke of this again."
1,horrible,"The 1974 version had class, this one is just trash! The leading lady who is in this movie is way to young for the part. I wouldn't even use this script as toilet paper. The director is a bad choice and casting a bad choice. I wouldn't even recommend this movie to my worse enemy!"
2,"It's alive again, for some odd reason","In all honesty, I never thought Larry Cohen's original shlock fest It's Alive was anything special in the first place, and to no surprise, this direct-to-DVD remake isn't either. This time around, Bijou Philips and James Murray play the parents of the murderous, blood-hungry little tyke, who isn't quite as mutant-looking he was in the original film. That being said, there really isn't too much in the way of explanation as to much of what goes on in It's Alive, as we witness some people doing some very stupid things, and some non-sensical moments within the plot that are nothing short of head scratching. Still, there's something to admire as there are some genuine shocks to be had, but other than that, this new take on It's Alive is pretty limp, and pretty pointless too."
1,WORSE than I thought it would be,"If You've seen the Trailer....You've seen the whole Flick......The original was a great Exploitatiuon classic...this,,,,a waste of Film and Your time."
4,Intriguing glimpses into the history of Helen and its environs,"If you are someone like me who has driven by dilapidated structures or stumbled through small cemeteries and been curious about the people who lived and died in the area, you will be intrigued by the histories Mr. Gedney describes. The photographs and maps he includes add to the stories and give you a fascinating view into the past. Some of the book focuses on the gold rush, but most of the stories contained are about the people who lived in the area and the different paths they chose.I plan on visiting the Helen area and seeing for myself the different places the people lived... I will take the book along as a guide."
2,Evangelical tripe!,"I was excited to get started reading this book because one got the feeling that this was a work by an important ""insider"" looking at the information revolution. It was singular disappointment. Much too much time has been spent talking about his experience at Lotus and far too little on the specifics of what the information revolution entails. Th examples are uninspiring, old news. I was terribly disappointed although it did show very brief flashes of excellence. Don't waste your money."
5,Another winner from Lotus....,"This book brings out a conceptual framework for relating Data, Information, Knowledge and Work - and leveraging on IT to enable the Market Facing Enterprise to gain competitive advantage. Concise and to the point- Good reading."
1,America.com,"This book should really be called ""Why I love America and Lotus Notes. By Jeff 'Patriot' Papows.""After reading this very amateur attempt at writing a 'fact' based book, all I discovered was that this guy has a real attitude problem. Its not just the fact that he thinks that the USA is the bread and butter of the IT world (which is wrong), but he continually makes comments which highlight his arrogant and sometimes egotistical personality. For example he says .."".. by industry leaders such as Lotus, Microsoft, Netscape, Intel, and Cisco ..""Is he kidding when he refers to Lotus as being an IT industry leader? Or is the fact that he is the President and CEO of Lotus got something to do with it .. ? You guess ..Don't waste your time or money. Patriotic and corporate propaganda can be found at a lower price .. and with less reading time involved."
5,"Great sound, especially for the price!","I bought this product as an accompaniment to my Sennheiser Surround Sound headphones, to be used for my home theater. My headphones had good sound to start with, but were often too high on the bass end, and depending on whether I was watching a new DTS DVD, or an old, worn out VHS, I needed some more adjustment than what was available through the receiver. So I saw the Beringer, and was initially hesitant, because it was so inexpensive. I had to buy a 1/4"" jack to dual-RCA line splitter to make them work, but when I did...WOW!! Granted this is lightweight and plastic (not a heavy duty, daily adjustment, studio level EQ) but for any home theater headphone guy like myself, these can't be beat. There are plenty of adjustments to help knock out low-end hiss on VHS, and enough subtlety to deliver a full DTS range with lots of punch. Thanks Beringer! As they say on their logo.. Just Listen!!"
4,works great!,"really, my only reason for not giving this 5 stars, is i wish it came out a little darker on darker fabrics- however, it's totally not a big deal. it works really well, super easy to wash off, no trace left on fabric."
2,DVD HAS POOR SOUND QUALITY!!!!,"I have always been a fan of Alejandro Sanz, when his unplugged was released on CD I ran to the store to purchase it. I waited (like a child on X-Mas eve) for the DVD to be released only to see get disappointed when I saw that their is a difference of roughly one second between what you hear and what you see, it sounds as if it was re-recorded in a studio, even the crowd clapping sounds computerized. Please don't take this review as if I don't like Sanz music, I have loved his music ever since he released ""3"" his third CD and own every single CD he has released, my recommendation is buy the DVD and listen to it with the TV off, or just buy the CD."
5,Teddy's Best,I have listened to Teddy Wilson for many years. His work with Goodman is incomparable as is his own as evidenced in this twofer. I bought this for the trio work where Wilson really shines. Agreat buy
4,Walt & El Grupo,"This was a gift for my son who is a stop motion animation film student, and it was very informative. A great bit of history and if your a fan of Walt Disney this is a must see."
3,Walt & El Grupo,This entertaining documentary gave me an insight into a part of Walt's career of which I was unaware. It is interesting to hear the comments of the various persons in South America and their reactions to a visit by the great man albeit at the request of the then American government. I add this to my growing Disney DVD collection and hope that perhaps soon it can be joined by Destino.
3,Interesting slice of the Walt Disney story,"This follows the Walt Disney Company's trip through South America on F.D.R.'s ""Good Neighbor Policy"" tour to develop new films about the ABC countries. Of interest to any fan of classic Disney, but not the most lively thing you ever saw. Lots of talking heads and few examples from the films that came out of the trip. It is less a ""making of"" documentary than an exploration of how Walt Disney's presence in South American affected the people aware of his influence in those years right before WWII."
2,Disappointing,After viewing other titles in this series and greatly enjoying them. I found this one very disappointing. Too much skipping around
2,A Beautiful but Dull Travelogue with A Must-Have Bonus Feature,"This is a beautiful film loaded with pictures, but it is rather dull. It's a travelogue of sorts that doesn't provide much insight into the personalities involved. If you are a Disney animation fan, there are a few tidbits which will let you see the germs of ideas for SALUDOS AMIGOS and THE THREE CABALLEROS.What makes this disc a must-have, though, is that it includes an UNEDITED version of SALUDOS AMIGOS. Bring on the cigarettes!"
4,Carolina Coittage Martha end table,"The product was easy to put together and in good shape. I am using it as a night stand in my bedroom and I think it looks good. A lanscape photo, lamp, phone on top of table and below remotes for the tv and a book.Very pleasing to the eye, very attractive."
2,Disappointed,"Received table yesterday--box taped at seams--opened box to find small plastic bag with all the necessary bolts, screws, washers, etc. strewn everywhere as bag was torn. Collected everything and found that there were missing washers that had obviously fallen through open seams in box. Luckily, we have a collection of stuff like this in tool box and was able to get the table together. Then found the top edge of table was damaged with a chunk out of the wood and paint was scratched. I thought I was ordering a round table, but found it was oval instead . . . so disappointed all around with this product, but don't feel like the hassle of taking it apart and returning it, so I slapped a tablecloth on it and put a lamp on it. Sorry, can't recommend this product!"
2,not quite what I wanted,"yes this is lilac oil, but to me it seemed like it might be old. dark golden color, like when your perfume has been sitting around for years, and the scent is a bit off. not light and breezy like you would expect lilac oil to be, a bit too strong."
1,Too Tight for 18-55mm DX Lense,I have the AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm DX lens and this bag is way too snug. The width is too tight making it very hard to place the lens in the bag and remove it. If you have the HB-45 hood attached (reversed) it is nearly impossible.
5,Soft case for Nikon lens 18-55Mm,Excellent soft bag keeps the lens dust free and safe inside my camera bag. Shipping was on time and product exactly as described. I wouldn't hesitate to order other sizes if required.
1,Precious! Way too precious.,"Hiero's Journey began well enough. The writing is average and the story is interesting enough. The psi aspect is good, as are the animals. But then, about half way through our Hiero meets an adorable princess and from then on the story becomes way to precious, coquettish and coy to stomach. No one told the author that once the lovers declare their love the romance is over, I guess. What this book needed was an editor with a red pencil to cut all this flowery language, redundancy and cuteness. If he's still alive, the writer is in his eighties, but the prose reads as if a teenager wrote it. This comes from a romantic, by the way. Anybody want to buy a copy (and the sequel) cheap? Lesson one: never buy the sequel until you've read the first book, regardless of the reviews. Live and learn."
2,Disappointed it the quality,"I have the paper back of this book. I was very disappointed in the quality of this ebook. It looks like it was scanned, OCR'ed, and maybe spell checked. It appears that no human bothered to look at the output before they published it. The formatting is very bad and there are special characters in place of letters through out the text."
3,Decent Fantasy Style Post Apocalyptic Sci-Fi,"Hiero's Journey (1973) by Sterling Lanier - 275 pages - rating: 7.5/10Adventurous journey across post apocalyptic North America ( including many Canadian references ) reminiscent of classic odyssey style tale. Hiero meets and picks up several interesting characters along the way as he heads towards an uncertain goal while battling numerous evil creatures of both human and animal origin. Jungles, the high seas and swamp settings keep the backdrop ever changing. He even hooks up along the way with a tasty young female morsel with a shockingly significant age differential.The writing style flows smoothly but there are several uncommon words that would require most of us to consult a dictionary. Otherwise a highly enjoyable and frequently exciting story.Claus Kellermann2006 April 11Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com"
2,Most hilarius line that I have seen in a childrens book,"The first time I read this book to my child I had to withhold laughter because of a line in it that has since been emblazened into my brain forever. After the animals realize it is Farmer Brown's birthday they each recite a verse on how they will help the farmer. The horse will pull his cart, the cow will give him milk, etc.But when they come to the turkey, this is his verse:""Gobble Gobble Gobble! Come Thanksgiving day, I will help Farmer Brown in my own special way!"""
2,Not As Advertised or Good As the Original,"This was supposed to be a board book, but it was not. I would have been alright with that, but when it was re-released the publisher removed several pages. The book that I have was re-printed in the 70's, and it has the entire story. It is my children's favorite story. I bought several of these to give to my nieces and nephews and was very disappointed. Do not buy this reprint. Look for an old copy at a thrift store or yard sale."
2,Confession of a Former Fan,"I'll admit it. I used to like Lou Reed. Even today, I think that ""Rock and Roll Animal"" is a pretty good album (CD). I bought this recording 15 years ago. I wanted to like it. I did like it. A couple tunes are - at the mo - a bit catchy. BUT, this album does not wear well. It's simplistic. The idea of a 40+ pop star singing about playing video games is just dumb. What is really annoying about this recording, though, is the song ""Fly Into the Sun."" In this tune, Lou confesses that he has no fear of nuclear war and welcomes the chance to meet his maker. It's the swan song of a potentially talented musician who basically sold out, gave up, and proclaims his own death wish. Lou, if you're reading this, GROW UP!"
5,"LOU, LOU, LOU","I'VE BEEN LOU'S BIGGEST FAN SINCE HIS DAYS WITH THE VELVET UNDERGROUND (1970) AND I'VE GOT TO SAY THIS IS ONE OF HIS FINEST ALBUMS! IF YOU LIKE HIM, YOU'LL LOVE THIS!!!"
5,Pure Genius,"I first listened to this album in 1986 and loved My Friend George. Having listened to it recently the allure has not faded and i particularly like Turn to Me and Doin The Things That We Want To (My adopted anthem for this year). Crank up both songs, and listen out for the first guitar solo on Turn to Me, 20 seconds of magic. This guy gets no airplay in Australia and that puzzles me as i think this album is a classic!"
4,New Sensations,"On a roll after The Blue Mask and Legendary Hearts, Lou Reed didn't disappoint with New Sensations. The album's full of well-written songs backed up by some solid playing. Listening to it now, the album's got a slicker 80's feel than some of his others, and the 80's ""big drum sound"" can be distracting, especially on an otherwise terrific song like ""What Becomes A Legend Most."" Lou Reed provides the lead and most of the rhythm guitars himself, which is ok but I missed having another guitarist (like Robert Quine) to bounce the leads off of.But like I said, there are some great songs here, including the luminescent ""New Sensations,"" the quirky and funny ""High In The City,"" and the poignant rocker ""My Friend George."" Lou Reed's always been a superb storyteller and the songs here are further proof of that."
5,I'D BREAK UP INTO A MILLION PIECES & FLY INTO THE SUN,"To END THIS MYSTERY, And anyone who stays high in the city everyday all day! not only for lou Reed fans This Album is a whole other level anyone who doesn't like this is crazy, TURN TO ME is life changing, one of the smoothest albums of the 80's Period Point blank. Not a bad track on entire album. Endlessly Jealous must of been hard for him to admit, it's the story of all people who get high in the city so cop it, LOU REED IS New York City straight up, I'm convinced no other artist can capture city life like this man, NOBODY!! He Keeps it too real and gets no respect."
4,Better than most,"I've read a lot of books on web-related subjects - this is one of the best for the technical aspects. It gives you an overview of various web-programming subjects and concerns, which makes it a good starting point as well as a pretty good reference."
1,A Better Man,"This was not what I thought I was ordering. There were only 4 tracks. The descrition of tracks was NOT clear but must have only pertained to the MP3 download. I purchased the CD thinking the track Life, Love Happiness would be included. It was not. Would not have purchased if the CD version would have been clear about what tracks were on it."
4,Nice ideas,"I have made a number of banners for my church and this book has offered me some nice ideas. It has much to offer both beginners and advanced banner artists. It is laid out by church season, which I found helpful. The graphics are clear and varied. Some are traditional, but many are quite modern. It even offers color suggestions. The only part that I was not excited about was that almost all of the banners had some kind of script incorporated into them. I many times let the pattern and graphic stand alone without using the words."
2,Unclear;repetitious; no color or even shading,"I have three banner books and have used this one just once despite having made over three dozen banners. Most banner books are in black and white but by the use of shades of gray, you get some idea of what the banner could look like. This book includes only black and white line drawings which means that much imagination is required to picture the finished banner. There are no pictures of finished banners, not even on the cover, which was not very inspirng to me; I needed pictures when I first started. The ""Quick and Easy Reference Guide"" was not, for me, either quick (""outine all the design pieces with narrow strips of black felt...glue each strip along the very outside edge of each piece, carefully bending or stretching the felt to match the curve"") nor easy (17 steps!) The copyright is 1996 which may account for some of the problems."
3,Pretty good,"Purchase for my banners committee, liked the instructions and a few samples, only using the designed as a guide we will come up with some of our own."
5,Finally someone listens,"I have worn out and been through so many pairs of ""Good"" Tactical gloves it is not even funny. Just a few no brainer's here on a good all around tactical glove. The glove should not cause any additional stress on your palms when using your digits. The glove should act as an extension to your hand allowing you to freely move your digits, feel your digits under all circumstances and be tough so that it will withstand the abuses you put it through. This glove is it as it meets and exceeds all the above and more. I would highly recommend these gloves as an addition to your tactical gear."
3,good gloves,The gloves were ok. I have small hands and a medium was too small for my hands. I returned them and didnt get new ones but the gloves were ok.
2,Made me sleepy.,"Basically, this book contains random thoughts on whatever subject the author happened to be thinking about. It is not in any way a book or novel, but a collection of scrap notes. It is interesting once but not worth buying."
3,i expected better,"After all the hype, after all the wonderful things I had heard about James Fenton, I was expecting a great collection of poetry when I picked up Out of Danger. Boy was I disappointed. Fenton spent too much time trying to be political or to vague in his writing. There were a couple of bright spots in the collection. The title poem is one of the best he has ever written and there is another poem, ""In Paris With You"" which isn't a great poem, but it is a charming one that I think you'll find as wonderful as I do."
4,"Beautifully written, but not my favorite of Mary Lawson's","I really enjoy Mary Lawson's style of writing. She has such emotional depth. However, I liked Crow Lake (her first book) a lot better. I didn't connect near as much with the characters in this book. Also, the ending was a little too tragic for my taste. There were also some paragraphs I had to skip because they got a little too steamy for my taste. There was also some language to contend with. Those things aside, I don't regret reading the book. It is beautifully written."
1,"Predictable, tedious and overwrought","From the first chapter of this book I had my doubts about this book but slogged through because of all the wonderful reviews I read here on Amazon. Mistake. It was a complete waste of time and I was almost furious by the end when the plot developed exactly the way I'd predicted. In addition, I hated being reminded of plot developments throughout; why does the author feel she has to remind me of something that happened a few chapters before? At several points I wondered if this was written for pre-teens especially pre-teens born after WWII. I wished I'd listened to my gut and put the darned thing down when I first grew suspicious."
5,Mary Lawson has done it again!,"This will be one of my favorite reads for 2007. Mary Lawson is quite a talented writer, and again has kept my attention until the very last page. Lawson accomplished excellence in developing the personalities in this story. This book was a page turner, hard to put down, and I definitely was not disappointed after reading Crow Lake."
4,Very Good,"Purchased this for a Christmas gift, and it was well received, and read instantly. They totally enjoyed it and are looking for more of this writers stories.Well doneMAJ"
3,Bad and Good,Vanilla is the worst movie i have ever seen.A Little Comfort is good one but short with an od ending but worth getting.
1,Original????,"I thought this is orginal ""crystal quoest""product... I received some noname chinise product, not same as add.I feel very disappointed,but it's expencive to return it from north-europe to canada."
5,Well worth the price,"We got this model on Saturday. It replaced our lemon of a SONY plasma TV. We are EXREMELY satisfied with the picture AND sound for unlike our last plasma, this unit runs QUIET. Sleek, sexy design and it swivels. A delight and to me it gives every bit as good a picture as the 6000-10,000 dollar priced units. Go HITACHI!"
1,THE stupidest movie ever created,Don't waste the time or calories even considering buying or renting this movie. Absolutely horrible.
4,Cool Horror Flick!,There's something about this movie that really kept my attention. It left me on the edge of my seat. There is some decent acting and some excellent quality kills. I strongely recommend you add this film to your DVD collection.
1,The worst film I've ever seen...,"Don't let the positive reviews fool you. They fooled me. I selected this movie from pay-per-view and watched the first 30 minutes. I could not believe that this movie involved adults. My 8 and 10 year old nephews have put on better skits with their Transformer dolls. The only good thing is that I now have an answer for the question ""What was the absolutely worst movie you've ever seen?"""
1,Carni-bore,"Absolutely horrible, and not in a good way. Avoid at all costs, even if you dig cheesy horror flicks."
1,The worst movie on God's green and blue earth,"my little brother laughs at this piece of s*** of a movie. Everytime he watches it. If you gave this move something above a 2 then either you played on the movie. Or you been smoking that Blue berry yum yum, that's being for real. The movie is about four or five teenagers going into a house that has a monster in it. and the government wants to stop this monster that is in the house or some stupid s***. It's just a stupid story line. And when the movie starts you can't help but laugh at the level of dumb a**. Anyway they must have paid the actors $20 each to do this movie. Because none of them could act it was just a bad movie. I thought Jason X was the worst scary movie I every seen until I waste 81 mins of my life watching this garbage.Unless you want to waste 81 mins of your life away don't watch this."
2,CarniBore is more like it.,"There are cheap horror movies that are funny, and there are the ""Carnivores"" of the DVD world. The storyline to this movie was so bad I couldn't take it. I actually fast forwarded this movie, and I live for B-horror. The rubber suit creature is funny (when you can see it), but like a lot of low-budget horror, the camera work is so bad you often see a black or heavily shadowed screen. I agree that the cover is one of the highlights of this movie. The endless dialogue in this movie makes for a great sleeping pill. Most of the ""made for the SciFi channel"" movies blow this out of the water. I give one star for the DVD cover and one star for the brief topless scene. I bought this for $5 from the Wal-Mart bargain bin and still feel ripped off."
1,How did this monstrousity make it onto DVD?,"Despite the promising cover - this movie was bad. Really bad. Not in the ""so bad its good"", but just bad.The acting is bad, the setting is bad, the plot is bad, the monster effects are bad, the jokes are bad, the mood is bad. Despite low expectations at the outset, this movie STILL managed to disappoint, it's that bad.The only thing NOT bad is the DVD cover artwork. That's it. (Which is why I picked it up at the local library in the first place - please don't waste any money on this.)This is apparently some kind of home movie attempt at a monster movie and how it ever got a DVD release is beyond me. It's like the type of movie you'd encounter on youtube - one made by drunk college students who don't realize how bad their production really is. I might have been a little more forgiving if it was only that, with about an hour or more cut from the running time.Seriously, how did this make it to DVD sales?"
4,6.00 At Its Best,"How can anyone bash this movie? For the price it is a good flick. I mean you can tell by the cover it isnt a block buster, anyone who loves all of those horrible snake attack movies and classic science fiction movies will enjoy this FOR WHAT IT IS. Its fun, and the greatest part is that you can laugh out loud at the special effects...20 years from now this will be a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 candidate!"
3,Irreverently entertaining,Great to get the scoop on a potential world disaster. Clawson delivers a potent warning to our national leaders. A must read.
3,It was a gift,"I bought this book as a gift, so not a great review. The individual read the book in 3 days and said it was ""OK"" but mentioned that it like to repeat the same information, and this was annoying."
1,Poor Quality Spoon Holder,"When I ordered this I was looking for a different style, but thought this was cute because my Husband is a Chef. Spoons glaze started cracking right away, and it broke within 3 weeks. Very unsatified, but ""you can't always get what you want""."
1,"Falls out of mount, Chipped my new bathtub",Showerhead falls out of mount and chipped the finish off my new bathtub. Do not buy this shower head.
3,Heavy on promise...short on delivery,"This is one of those stories that starts really well but doesn't end well. The world is full of ""normal"" people bequethed with super powers and those who should have super powers have no memory of their past. The writing is tight and the story compelling. Why three stars? The adversary to our heroes is poorly thought out--dare I say stupid (stupid origin, stupid powers, stupid motivations). When the master plan was finally revealed I was left thinking THAT's IT! It seemed contrived. It was a perfect buildup to nothing. This was a good concept that failed to be big enough in scope. I would buy it if you are really into the Justice League. There are good moments for all of the cast, but if there are other stories you could buy first--please do. I don't regret buying this as I am a fan of the genre. I'm simply disappointed with where this story might have went."
3,Part of this product I liked; part I ...,"Part of this product I liked; part I did not. First off, the directions on the bottle were different from the pamphlet, so I am not sure of the correct way to use it. After the mask dried it was pretty difficult to take off, but it did create a nice rosy complexion and made my skin feel smooth, which was nice. It says this is to help diminish wrinkles and since I am not quite at that stage yet, it was hard to know if it really did have an effect on them. Also you need a good 20 minutes to use this product, and if you have kids you don't always have that large of a block of time. The tonic that comes with it is nice to use alone, though, and is very refreshing on your face. To be honest, I wouldn't recommend the mask to anyone I know, but I would recommend the toner."
3,This product is really messy. You have to ...,"This product is really messy. You have to mix the toner and powder in your own container. Then you have to put it on with a brush in an upward direction and on your forehead from the center outward. To me, that's just way too much work and way too specific directions. Besides being messy and having specific directions that you have to follow, overall the product is pretty good."
3,"Produced, arranged, and engineered by Kramer.","In other words, if you are expecting a faithful rendering of Damon and Naomi's captivating live show, forget it!Kramer has taken it upon himself to layer a considerable amount of extra instrumentation and noise (crowd noises, chimes, flowing water, chirping birds, radio static) to this disc, and only about half of it actually works. There are some some exceptional moments on this album (the clarinet, piano and drum enhanced ""Pyewacket"", and synth-horn fueled ""Life Will Pass You By"" and the cheezy mellotron-like textures on ""Pandora's Box"" and ""How Long"" are very nice.), but often Kramer's noodling's only serves to strip these songs of their intimacy."
3,GREAT PICTORIAL GUIDE WITH A CD-ROM TO BRING IT ALIVE!,A vivid description of the brutality and loss of life through Brady photographs and other photographers of the era. Famous generals of both sides are featured in photos along with battle scenes and weaponry of the period. All photos fully captioned.
4,This book is revered throughout our household...,"A fascinating and rather bizarre beard manual, in that the author and illustrator both look like BBC commentators or other serious bearded folk, yet to book is totally dedicated and funny. Excellent sections on neglected topics: bearded lovemaking, ""Your Beard on the Prowl,"" and ""Dealing with Objections."" Also a good practical guide to care and feeding of the beard, moustache and sideburns, and a catalog of beard styles which are, surprisingly, not that dated once you look past the veneer of 70s line-drawing illustration and ignore the tunics that the subjects are portrayed wearing. It has revived my futile desire to grow facial hair."
3,a period piece,"_The Art of Growing a Beard_ is a good primer for beginners. The illustrations and overall tone are dreadfully out of date, although the humorous effects of these mid 70s artifacts might well be worth the book's price. In any case, if you're really intent on growing your beard in an idiosyncratic way, you might find equal inspiration just by looking through magazines of the period.I especially like the section on beard-lovin'."
2,Review of Le Garde Du Corps,"I purchased this dvd because I collect the films and books featuring the fine French actor, Sami Frey. After watching it, it is quite honestly the only reason to buy the movie. IOW, if you are not a fan of Sami Frey, don't bother."
4,"good read, lots of heart, for adults",The author throws in some adult stuff but I really enjoyed the rest of this book.
4,This is Mingus?,"From the GQ cover photo to the laid-back sound of Mingus' band, it is remarkable to think that this is the basic group of musicians that would later go on to record Mingus Ah Um just 2 years down the road. The hard-bop style of the period (1957) is displayed nicely here by Mingus and his cohorts. This could honestly pass for a Blue Note recording of the time, it is that much a blueprint for the genre. I had to pinch myself a few times for thinking that someone had secretly replaced the CD with a Miles Davis album.Not that any of it is bad, mind you. Just after hearing the angularities and fire of other sessions, this comes off as being a surprise. There are still some instances of the hallmark Mingus harmonies and hard-turns, but hearing them nestled amongst this quietly unassuming stock jazz is... well you can decide for yourself. Even without the strident urgency of his well-known stuff, I still like it."
3,Funny But Mostly Filler,"Some of the tracks on this CD are great, but some are just comedic filler. ""Bishop"" and ""The Temptation of Saint Victor"" are among the best, but on the whole, it's far inferior to some of their better work. But it's STILL funny."
3,"Same Ole, Same Ole","If you're fairly new to Monty Python, and you aren't a nutcase like me who already knows all of the songs by heart, then this CD would be a great addition to any learning fan. But if you're an age-old fan, this CD can be boring- you know the old already and have heard them a thousand times, and the the new songs on here aren't very interesting nor funny, either (except for perhaps Do What John?). So good for the less-extravagant fans, droll for the well-experienced."
2,Not worth it,"Real fans will enjoy two or so songs out of the 24.It was almost as if they indeed had some sort of obligation, or maybe a desperate need for cash."
3,The name says it all,"Unfortunately, this CD sounds like it was contractually obligated. Except for the hilarious ""Bookshop"", ""Bells"" and the song ""I Bet You They Won't Play This Song on the Radio"", a lot of this sounds uninspired. Some of it, like ""Traffic Lights"" is hard to listen to it's so stupid and unfunny. Many of the skits like ""Rock Notes"" and ""Crocodile"" are ok, but nothing compared to Python's classic bits. If you're a huge Python fan like me you'll listen to the good parts and skip the rest. If you're looking for a CD to get started on your Python journey, don't start here."
5,ALLL ABOARRRRD,"What a fun read! This will make you feel like a kid again, remembering your Lionel, American Flyer or HO train sets. Mr. Young amazes you with well researched facts and rare illustrations on how dominant the railroad was in developing this great land, and especially Chicagoland. I have found that my consciousness has changed and each time I see a track, wait for a train to pass at a crossing, or go for a train ride, I feel a part of something great and wonderful about America. This is a thoughtful gift for your friends who feel the romance of trains in their lives. Alllll Aborrrrd!"
1,why are book descriptions so hard to find in here?,why are book descriptions so hard to find in here?
2,Ego trip,"I purchased this book in hopes of getting to read about various cases and methods of ID'ing victims of crime. Instead, I get page after page of the author telling me how great she is at everything she does. I certainly do wish I had that money back!"
2,Ego Trip is Right!,"I have a passion for forensic science books. Although this book is well written, what takes away the joy of reading it is the author's tremendous ego. That really annoyed me. At the end of the book, the reader can do nothing other than exclaim (facetiously, of course): Wow! What would the world ever do without Emily Craig?! I fully agree with the prior reviewer who was rightfully more critical of the Craig ego than I am here; thus, I will not bother repeating those valid comments. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book when there are so many more objective and exciting forensic science books out there written by true experts who are not afraid to give credit where it is due. I rarely give a book such a low rating, but in this case, it is the author's inflated ego that has earned it and not the material that the book covers."
1,not for everyone with rosacea,"Order the sample kit before using any rosacea product,. I bought this, and shouldn't have without a test case. It was not good for my skin. I have heard some people have success with it, but since everyone with rosacea is different, there is no way to know. So you can sink a large amount of cash into this and then have to throw it away. If you must try Kamins, I'd say get the sampler first and be very careful. We rosacea people never stop hoping!"
2,it's quite a bad purchase experience,"Not for the product itself, i'm quite waitng for this product to use during my pregnant time, however when i got it, the prodect has expired the time, hardly to imagine why this could happen, so disappointed"
5,Best traditional version,"I'd like to start by saying that I see too many people comparing Godspell and Jesus Christ Superstar. The fact is that they can't be compared. Godspell is witty, charming, and beautiful and Superstar is bold, powerful, and emotional. I love them both. Now onto my review...This is a fantasic CD. It captures the wonderful feel of Godspell perfectly. The actors all have excellent voices and the sound quality is perfect. If you're a looking for a good, traditional Godspell recording, then this is the one to get"
1,Is it in stereo?,"I have heard that the labels were having financial troubles during the time this film was produced, so this made this soundtrack was made in MONO. Is that true?"
2,Disappointed,BIG Disappointment! I thought it was from the movie which it says it is but it does NOT include the Boom-Chicca-Boom song that we LOVE!!!! So now what??? We have an incomplete CD. I was not happy with this.
2,Not as good as 2001 touring cast.,"This version was good, but not as good as the touring cast version. The songs are just so old and crappy sounding. The new 2001 version is more modern-aged, up beat, techno kind of music. I have this CD and the touring cast, and I listen to the touring cast CD more than I do this one. This CD DOESN'T have TOWER OF BABBLE, PROLOUGE, WE BESEECH THEE, and a couple more. I would recommend getting the touring cast rather than this one, unless you like the old 70's kinds of music then get this one."
5,Lovely musical!,"I used to watch this movie and play the soundtrack album over and over when I was in high school. I was thrilled to find it again on CD since I had long lost my old vinyl. Super sweet melodies, superb lyrics. And Victor Garber has a great voice. They all do. If you're a fan of old 70s musicals, get this!"
4,If you like the movie!,"Cd is good quality and sounds just like the movie. If you like the movie, then you will probably like this too! Just a caution-the songs are not exactly the same as the Broadway musical!"
4,Obssessed with oldies!,"I'm ten & my Mom took me to see the play 'Godspell' with my friend Victoria. All three of us loved it!! I like the Prepare Ye (it's baisicly rock!)my friend Victoria likes Turn Back Ol'Man. And my Mom likes All Good Gifts. It's ALL really AWESOME!(just don't let you're Mom sing ALL THE SONGS,it's embarassing!)"
5,Papaya concentrate,"This product is the best healer of any type of skin disorder. This product does more than exfoliant. I have used it for precancerous skin treatments, skin abraisions, and rashes. It is wonderful."
1,Zia has changed the ingredients of the same named product,"I ordered this product because of the great results I had from a sample packet. The order came from Nutricity and I was very disappointed with the results after using it just once. When I compared the ingredients, they had changed significantly. The papaya in the name had dropped much further down on the ingredient list meaning there was much less of it in the product. The box that the bottle came in even had a new ingredient list glued over the origianl list. I contacted Nutricity but they were unwilling to accept a return on the product. I would not recommend this product or Nutricity. Who would really look to see if ingredients had changed from a sample and that the name of the product still stayed the same! Isn't that the reason samples were created - to sample the ""expected"" product? I was disappointed with Nutricity's response under such circumstances."
4,This works for me,"Zia Exfoliant works for me as a mild exfoliant. I can see that a top layer of skin is being removed each time I use this product. Yet it is not harsh for my skin. I don't see a HUGE change in my skin, wrinkles and discolorations are still there. But my skin looks brighter and smoother to the touch. No one has remarked on this! But since I know it is doing what I want, I will continue to use the product to stimulate my skin. I do not have especially sensitive skin, and also use glycolic acid peels at home every two weeks or so. Nothing makes my skin look 20 years younger -but since using these types of products, my face is no longer as tan as my body (tan is just from daily walks WITH sunscreen) so I know layers of skin are being exfoliated. Is this a good thing? Hope so!"
2,Boring,"I knew Nurget and had the pleasure of riding with him in the mid 70's when I lived in Hamilton. He was a fun, smart and happy guy. I was surprised that he made such a name for himself. Langton seems to jump around throughout the whole book, leaving the reader confused at times. Perhaps he could have got some help writing the book from a real writer. It is obvious he sides with the police authorities, giving a very one sided view of the biker lifestyle. He has made several errors pertaining to the biker culture and some of the events that took place."
3,facts and names lacking storytelling,"The author have gone though a great deal to find the facts in hundreds of events during many years. He covers hundreds of people. Hundreds of crimes and killings. He could have picked a few events, clubs or people and written their full story. Instead the book hops between people and clubs, between centuries and continents like a school book. Theres no story, but namedropping enough to confuse anyone. Stadnik is one of hundreds of figures skidding though events, none of them with depth. People are shot and stabbed, but you find it difficult to care, since none is in the book for more than a page, and you dont get to know them. It feels disorganised. If it was in cronical order, or at least with chapter names reveiling what every chapter will cover it would be easier. Perhaps its interesting and understandable for the surviving few who were there. If your looking for facts its fine, but its too packed with facts for me. I need a story."
1,Poorly Written And Poorly Researched,"The author should have called this book A History Of People Killed In Canada as he does very little to chronicalize or write a biography about Walter Stadnick. He has way to many people involved in the book, some who arent even Hells Angels, who have no connection to Stadnick or the Hells Angels and on every page some one else is being murdered. The information gets shot out of a cannon in an unorganized explosion leaving the reader wondering when the author is actually going to talk about Stadnick and stop talking about every murder that took place during the alleged Canadian Biker Wars. As another reviewer wrote, he misstates facts and writes things as fact in regards to the Hells Angels MC that aren't verified and are pure speculation. Would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,Fallen Angel: The Unlikely Rise of Walter Stadnick and the Canadian Hells Angels,"good book with great, little known info about the Angels and there members"
2,Poorly Made,"These are so cute and look fantastic on my puppy; however, they are poorly manufactured. The minute I put them on Cutie, they tore. The sewing part wasn't sewn properly, so I had to re-sew them myself. Not sure if I received a bad batch. I suggest that before anyone puts these on their puppies to reinforce them beforehand just in case."
4,intro to cell culture,"I found this book to be very helpful. The information is current and clearly presented. (other texts I purchased had more recent publication dates, but were clearly out-of-date in the techniques and equipment used).I run a high through-put cell culture lab (about 4000 T175 per week). I purchased the text mainly as a training aid.50% of my staff 'person hours' come from part time college students who only stayed for one or 2 semesters, thus I am faced with having to train new staff often.This text gives a good, clear introduction to the basics of cell culture and sterile technique and significantly cut down on the amount of time it took me to train new staff. I made it required reading for all my staff!"
3,This bus actually will move,I too ordered this bus as for $7+ it seemed like a bargain. I was really worried after reading reviews here that it didn't move. So even though this was to be a gift I opened it once I got it too see for myself. I got 2 AA batteries for the remote and tried to forward and reverse buttons and I got NADA. But my title says it moves so what gives you may be wondering. Well in small type they mention that the included batteries with the bus should be replaced so I did and then voila the rear wheels spin when you use the remote. Granted it doesn't move great but it will go forward and backup
1,Doesn't move at all,"I bought it for its R/C feature. However, it doesn't move at all. The remote controller only works for sounds and lights. Very disappointed."
4,school bus that never breaks,"This is a good toy but less for education. We have had this bus for almost two years. Our boys now a bit over three have fun running it around the house, either sitting on or pushing it.It is a heavy duty toy. Certainly a good price."
3,T. Martin,"This works OK, however it is hard to navigate and control....probably would be good for children ages 4 and up...."
2,The price tells it all,"I don't know why it says ""Remote control"". It HAS a wire about a foot long that connects control buttons and the bus. It is definately not a remote. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it has a wire. The picture conceivably hid the wire."
1,don't waste your $$$$$$$$$$$,"The same happened to me!!!!!!!!! I bought it thinking it was a good bargain, and just today placed the batteries and it does not run! very disapointed with a v-tech toy"
2,Not tough enough,"The tubes are great while they last, but the first one I got the handle developed a tear during the first workout rendering it pretty much useless. Okay, just a manufacturing defect I thought; no biggie. Well it happened again on the replacement one. I contacted the company directly, who promised to send me another, but it has been over a month and nothing's arrived. The handles just aren't strong enough. It's probably not an issue for the lighter tension tubes, but not these. It's a great workout while it lasts. Cable training is highly underrated and I may never buy freeweights again. I will however, be buying another brand of cables from now on though."
5,good bands,"I purchased the set of bands 10, 15, 20 lbs. to replace ones that snapped in 2 that came with a Spri video. I use them with the P90X work out. I definately like these because they feel sturdier and have good substantial plastic handles."
1,Avoid this product !,"Major problem to install software. Worked for 1 day then software crashed. Tried on multiple computers and still had problems, and I am not computer illiterate. Customer service, when I finally got through was not helpful and quite rude. I wasted so much time on this and was frustrated since I really wanted it to work ! I would avoid it."
3,"Interesting, ancient history","I'm not one much for reviewing political, religious or other controversial subject matter. I read some of it but don't care to be categorized simply because I want to know what's out there. On such material, I'll likely give 3 stars since there's not a no-comment option."
3,"OK, but. . .","Before you buy this, sample Dr. Nyland's modern translation. You might like it better. I did. There are notes, a detailed introduction, and more text.BTW, this ebook has an interactive TOC, you just can't access it directly from the menu."
2,A SAD SWAN SONG...,"THIS IS RORY'S FINAL STUDIO ALBUM, AND A VERY SAD GOODBYE IT IS TOO.THE WEARINESS AND ILLNESS THAT PLAGUED THIS UNPARALLELED MUSICIAN IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE ARE EVIDENT THE LETHARGY THAT PERMEATES EVERY SONG.I PREFER TO THINK OF HIS PREVIOUS ALBUM ""DEFENDER"" AS HIS EPITAPH-NOT UP TO HIS CLASSIC SEVENTIES PERIOD,BUT VERY SOLID NONETHELESS...REST IN PEACE,RORY"
5,Talk about cool.,"I got this little number as it was the right size for me, and best suited for my main usage; the beach. Clearly it keeps things cold, and I am glad the lid will pop off if some kid decides to hide in it. The price was not to be beat and the color; very cool."
1,don't buy,"There is not water release at the bottom....so if you need to drain it, it is a pain in the ass. And shame on AMAZON for charging me 14 bucks to return it. No that wasn't the cost of shipping, that was my refund mins some kind of return fee. So don't buy it....it's not worth it."
5,Fabulous,"We got this for our honeymoon-- camping on the beach in August-- and things stayed frozen for the full week. It was pretty amazing. I actually got one as a present for a friend of ours to use during the summer as a car cooler, as we were in a full-day month long training together, and all have special diets. It kept everything nice and cold. On our honeymoon trip, we froze big blocks of ice in gallon-sized gladware containers, and it worked very well. This cooler works much better if you open it quickly and infrequently to keep the cold air inside."
3,Good Buy,"There are many coolers on the market and after looking at quite a few I felt this cooler met my needs and the price and free shippoing via prime were nice. NOTE: There is no drainage spout, the lid is not attached but fits quite snug. The cooler keeps drinks food cold and holds ice a few days at a time (approx. 2). Wheels and pull handle make it easy to transport,(the handle could have been a few inches longer). I gave it 3 stars cause its a good size, sturdy and we use it for occasional weekend camping or day beach trips and it works for what we need it for."
1,Difficult to open,"This cooler is difficult to open. I can't open it at all with one hand. If you have children who may need to open this cooler or you want to open this cooler without setting down your beer, think again."
2,"Keeps Ice, No Drain","This cooler did indeed do a very good job keeping ice for days at a time. If the ice didn't stay frozen, the water did stay cold for at least 5 days. The one MAJOR problem I had with this cooler is that it does not have a drain. Every other version of this cooler available comes with a drain except this one. I only wish I had realized that before I had bought it. Unfortunately though, this is the only Max Cold cooler that has wheels which was the major reason I bought it other then the Max Cold feature."
2,Poorly designed lid,This cooler keeps ice well but there are a couple of problems with the design. The cooler doesn't have a drain so it's a pain to drain the water when it's still full of food and drinks. The removable lid was a good idea but very poorly executed. The lid always falls off when you have it open to remove food. The lid is also prone to flying off(even when closed)when driving with it in the bed of your truck or boat. Be sure to tie it down because there isn't a latch to keep it closed.
3,"Good unit, but the 5d claims are false","Our refrigerator went out. We had an existing cooler where a two bag of ice became cold water within one day. That was a joke, so we bought this cooler. We've found that ice turns into cold water in it within 3 days (it was mostly water after about 2 days). Both of these situations occurred with the cooler being kept inside an air conditioned home. I cannot imagine how ice would come close to keeping anywhere close to 5 days out in 85 degree weather, even in the shade. So... this thing is 2-3x as good as our cheap old cooler, but I don't believe its 5d claims given our experience."
4,"as the title implies, it is for bioinformatician","Just browsing through this, I can see this book will be very useful for me (as a student majoring in bioinformatics).A very book explaining area most used in bioinformatics, and the price is ok for a 'starving student'."
5,child rearing,This is a great book to help your son become a great man. Highly recommend this book. Informative & to the point. Great confersation starters with your child.
3,Heard most of this before,"This short CD offers some of MP's most well-known and beloved sketches -- the Pet Shop, Argument Clinic, The Cheese Shop, etc. Some pieces (How do You Tell a Witch, Bring out your Dead) are taken from MP and the Holy Grail,. Others are taken from a performance before live audience (Hollywood Bowl?) and others are taken from MP's well-produced studio version of the sketches. There are a few lesser known pieces (Elephatoplasty and Phone-In) that will make this album bearable for MP aficionados. Some of my faves (like Spanish Inquisition) wwere left off.Not sure what the appropriate audience is for this collection of MP's finest. MP newbies? Naw -- they might be put off by the extreme (and atypical) vulgarity in the first cut. Longtime MP fans? Not likely -- they have heard these sketches ad infinitum and probably own larger collections."
1,Shipping charges cancel out great product,This item received one star not due to the product but due to the shipping charges. At $15.58/12.5 oz pkg when other sites charge about $5.50 it is prohibitive to buy them from Amazon. They work great to catch the drippings from the Weber Summit gas grills and make clean up very easy but you'll need to order them from a third party at a cheaper shipping rate. They are also available a couple of other places on the web for a total cheaper price. I was going to line the grill's permanent drip pan with heavy duty aluminum foil before I would pay Amazon's shipping price! Happily there was a third party site with a total charge of $5.49 for 2 sets!
1,misleading as repair product....,"I have been using this product every night since April and it does not make the age spots or freckles disappear so it is not a repair formula. If anything, it just seems to keep them from getting darker. I do agree that it is expensive and will not reorder when finished with jar."
3,Ok so far.,"Very Expensive. I have been using it for about 2 months for the sun spots near the side of my eyes and forehead. So far I have seen them fade a little bit, but that could also be due to it being fall and me not being in the sun as much. I have plenty left and I only use a little bit on those areas so this product should last me a long time. So only time will tell."
5,Two classic artists together.,"In my hotel in Paris circa 1970 I heard a great duet, Mouskouri (whom I hadn't heard of yet)and Belafonte. I caught a few bars on my Dictaphone and that evening the clerk at a record store on the Camps Elyses identified the album for me. I wore out my vinyl over the years and was pleased to find it on CD. If you are thirsty...great marriage of voices!"
3,Belafonte and Mouskouri,"This CD An Evening With Belafonte/Mouskouri appears to be a collection of 10 songs recorded in 1965. There are two duets, the others are individual songs. The songs are sweet but interesting. Nana is good, but Belafonte's forte is elsewhere"
5,A very good example of fine music,This album has a very special touch that makes it different from the musical mainstream. The combination of the remarkable voices of Mouskouri and Belafonte results in a strong manifestation of feeling and excellent performance.Bravo!
4,Did not fit,"These jeans looked very good. But the fault is mine, not the jeans. I am weirdly shaped and they did not fit. I will find the right ones one day!I do not think anyone should hesitate to buy this product."
4,very nice silverware,"I got the Flatware as one of Amazons Lighting Deals and I'm glad I got it at a good price. Don't get me wrong, the Flatware is AMAZING, its a heavy stainless stell, very modern looking and from a very good company. But the way it arrived I thought it was some cheap silverware from walmart. It all came wrapped in plastic all thrown into one box. I figured since it is a good company and its kinda pricy it would come in a nice box all sorted. I was wrong :) Anyway, that the only thing I was dissapointed with. But as long as you dont mind the packaging its a very good investment."
1,Disappointed,"The product I received was not the item I thought I ordered. After doing some research, I discovered why. The picture on Amazon's website was for a completely different CD/DVD wallet. A customer service representative told me that Amazon would take action to correct the website and post the correct picture. Before completing this review, I checked Amazon's website. The picture still shows the incorrect product. Very disappointing."
4,Al Stewart's Passage through Time,"Since this album first appeared it has received extensive play and continues to this day to be heard in shopping malls, supermarkets and department stores. ""Time Passages"" and ""Song on the Radio"" have proved to be undaunted by time. Now in this ""tune up"" CD it is evident yet again that Al Stewart is a great genius, only partially recognized due to his mega hit ""Year of the Cat"" and this album. I recommend this work for it's fame and strongly suggest that you also purchase some of his earlier and more obscure works, especially the legendary ""Past, Present & Future"" (also available at Amazon.com on CD) and immerse yourself in the art of this great talent. Well worth your time and investment!"
4,Excellent Bronson film,"Ten to Midnight is Bronson's last excellent film. It gives a great portrayal of a killer (Gene Davis) who sets up alibis, then kills women in the nude. When one victim is a family friend of Bronson it gets personal. Bronson plays a homicide cop who knows who the killer is, but has no evidence. The killing scenes are very intense, and it tries to depict the psychology somewhat (he relives the scene of a girl slapping him on his way to kill her.)If you saw this film on TV you didn't see the film. Many scenes are cut out and somehow they switched the nude scenes to underwear scenes. You must see the uncut version on video to get the full impact."
4,My favorite Bronson film.,This film is worth watching the acting here was solid not great but solid. Obviously the nurses getting slaughtered in this film were inspired by the real life Chicago massacre committed by Richard speck but it was altered so the film won't get sued.
3,Don't stand too close to a naked man,"The completely nude serial killer is about the only thing that makes this movie stand out. Otherwise it is a pretty middle of the road, `80's action picture. The oh-so `80's music and some of the camera work almost make this feel like a parody of those movies. And the ridiculous dénouement practically screams Reagan-era conservatism.All this may sound like I didn't like the movie, but I did. It is no classic, but it's not a bad little time-waster."
1,YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING PRINCE!,"This is the worst ""Protege"" cd's he's ever produced and done. This is worst than Vanity 6 and Apollonia. The whole production seemed rushed and Mayte's vocals can't even save the poor songs that Prince wrote. Her vocals are terrible epecially on 'love's no fun'! Now I understand why it was only sold in Europe because none of the American music companies didn't want to sell this to distributors in the US because they knew how bad it was. Let's just say Britney Spears has more talent than this woman and that's the saying much! Listen to great ""protege"" records of Prince's kingdom like Jill Jones, Sheila E. even Ingrid Chavez is a far more superior production than this wasted cd. And some advice for Mayte, quit while you're ahead! What a disappointing effort!"
3,MAYTE//MAYTE,"I enjoyed this CD. I thought it was a great effort on her part. I enjoyed In Your Gracious Name, Children Of The Sun,Baby Don't Care.....I can't wait for her next CD!Definitely worth buying and will be a sure collector's item!"
1,Prince takes another Hit on the Chin,"as talented as Prince is He feels that every Woman He gets involved with needs to make a Album.the stuff that He produces on Himself works usually.but as far as being a Producer on others He leaves alot to be desired.Mayte is the latest in the Carmen Electra,Vanity,Apolonia,bag of Suspect Vocalists.He wastes time here.what a Waste of THe Commodores ""Brick House""?I Hope Prince can get His Own thing back on course&Leave Lightweights alone Period.this is good for laughs but not anything more."
3,Not Perfect but...,"Ok Ok so its not Princes best work with a protege'. But he didnt have much to work with either. Lets face it, this is the first time we've even heard her sing. Usually we just see her dance or hear her finger cymbals. I think we expected too much. You just arent going to get the magic of ""Sugar Walls"", ""Manic Monday"" or ""Nasty Girl"". OK?!...so....The album on the whole is not great, but any die-hard prince fan will want to get this album just for the sake of having it in their collection. (Much like Carmen Electra's album)."
1,Not good,"This was an all around bad protoge CD.....bad vocals, bad production and bad songs. Not worth the purchase even for the Prince fanaticals."
1,What a waste of time,"Prince next time do us a favor and find some real talent to produce. You can tell she's just riding on your ""coattails"". The cd is just plain awful. The woman has no vocal talent at all along being the worst dancer on stage. And it just seems rushed the whole production. Stay away from this cd, please!"
1,Bad script equals bad move,"I enjoyed Open Season so much that when we got a baby farm piglet as a pet we named him Boog. But the script for O.S.2 is so bad that what passes for humor never even made me smile though I did wince any number of occasions. The screen writer's idea funny is a power/control obsessed frison biche, and that might have been funny. Unfortunaly the writer gives it an endless stream of angry frothing dialog that is as witless as it is tiresome. And that's the movie's high point. Being an older person I sometimes wonder if I'm missing humor that would appeal to the youngsters. But try as I might I can't find anything good to say about this film for any age group."
3,Open Season Again -- This time on a budget.,"If you loved Open Season then you'll probably like seeing the characters back in action in a new adventure. Here's are some ways the sequel differs from the original:1. No new rockin' songs in the soundtrack.2. Backgrounds minimal and often cheesy with a cheap done-in-haste look.3. One hour and sixteen minutes, or about as short as a movie can be and still be called a ""movie"".4. Different voice actors for the two main characters (but they did OK).5. A deleted scene that would have been great but I'm guessing was nixed because it would cost too much to fully animate.Still, we get some character development and a happily-ever-after ending. And I'm glad they made Giselle a central character and played her off against Elliot. The story is rather fun too, as we get to meet a whole new group of pampered pets.So, it's fun to watch a reprise of the Open Season world, but rather disappointing in that it seems corners were cut all over the place."
1,Laugh Count,Aside from the trite story line and really cheap animation the real reason for watching this animation was going to be it's anticipated hilarious humor. So here's the humor count: Half chuckle 10 minutes into movie; another half chuckle around 23 and again 45 minutes. Fell asleep between 23 and 45 so there may be more. Story was resolved at about 65 minutes and the final 20 minutes was pointless filler. Suggestion: Stop at Open Season 1 if you want to be left with fond memories.
1,total garbage,1. Doesn't have Martin Lawrence or Ashton Kutcher2. Lots of sexual innuendos3. Lame story4. Dissapointing looking character models/animation (doesnt come close to the first)dont waste your money.
3,Open Season 2 review,"I didn't have any expectations for this movie, but I liked the first one and wanted to buy this one as well. I was a bit disappointed in the story line and more disappointed that the original cast did not do the voices for this one. It has it's funny parts though. Not as good as Madagascar 2 but I'll keep it."
1,Nap time,Not as good as the first one and not nearly up to par with any of the other current or past pixar films. Looks more like a cartoon then animation. Poorly written I dont even know what the story line is about....it just drags on and on and on. None of the original actors returned from the first one which I was not aware of till I popped this in the DVD.Excellent movie to take a nap too but thats about it.
2,Terrible Letdown,"I love the first one but this one was a major letdown. Unfortunately, my sister loves it so I have to watch it all the time. Recommendation: DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO GET YOURSELF TO TURN THE TV OFF!!!!"
1,Just Awful!,"We were so disappointed in this movie, it was just awful. The barely veiled foul language references make this movie completely inappropriate for younger children. The quality of the art work was poor. The dialogue was annoying. If Sony Pictures wants to compete in the animated market, it is going to have to do better than this!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"The first open season wasn't too bad, but the sequel is simply terrible. We bought it without any knowledge of it, and basically threw our money away. I seriously doubt we will ever watch it again. My 2 year old recognizes the characters, and actually watched the first 30 minutes of the movie. However, he grew tired of it and we had to put in WALL E.The animation looks like two separate groups developed the characters. The characters from the first movie look like they did in the first movie. The new characters look like cheap CGI. Hope you know what I mean because it's hard for me to explain otherwise.Overall, I can understand why it went straight to DVD. Buy it at your own risk."
1,This is a film for kids??! Huge waste of money!,"It takes a LOT to offend my husband, but after enduring a half hour of nothing but sexual innuendos, he couldn't stand it anymore. Neither of us could believe this film is actually marketed to young children. I've never wanted my money back so badly as I do with this DVD. I encourage parents to watch this film BEFORE allowing their kids to see it. (Our own children are 5-1/2 and 7.) If you are liberal minded, you probably won't care. But if you are more on the conservative side, you may find this film quite offensive. This was the biggest waste of money and I want every penny back!!"
4,Kids will love it!,"Bought this movie for the grandkids, and they loved it. I was a little bored but then again it was made for the younger crowd!"
3,Open Season 2 is ok.,To me it's not as good as Open Season 1 or 3. It's the last movie I put on when I 'm watching movies.
5,Cute story,"I love all of the Open Seasons and it's great one for kids, too! Will keep you laughing, and it does teacha lesson if you look for it!"
5,Great movie,This is a great movie in the Open Season series. The kids really enjoy having all of them in the series and have been very happy with it.
5,wonderful,great movie and I hace purchased it several times because my grandchildren watch it so much they wear it out! That's when you know it was a hit!!!
5,very good,"My daughter Love it! It is nice to just click and buy the movie . Also you don't have t carry cds around the car for the trip, very easy to pack the kindle and go!!"
4,Good Follow Up Movie!,"This is a good follow up movies to the first. Most time they don't even come close, but this one actually did with song too!"
3,Good Dog Movie,"I thought it was a good movie, not as good as the first one. If you have a pet dog you will love it."
1,Boring movie without original voice-cast,"My kids were mostly entertained by this, but I was bored to tears. Actually, the movie wasn't just boring but irritating. Wish I had picked a different movie for us all to watch."
1,Total Dud - Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. After watching all three of the Ice Age movies repeatedly (my son's favorites), I was expecting the same level of storyline, humor, animation, voice-overs, etc. Open Season 2 doesn't even come close. I'm sorry I wasted the money on it and will probably put it back up for sale. There is some inappopriate sexual innuendo and a scene in the beginning in which the animals in some sort of twisted game throw live bunnies at each other. I don't know why anyone would find that funny, and it may even traumatize some kids. My wife and I looked at each other multiple times during the movie with that, ""What the he## kind of movie is this? look."" Keep your money in your pocket on this one."
4,Good film,Good film. Some of the player choices are hard to swallow. Many players would not be able to play in some of the earlier eras.
4,Very enjoyable countdown of the greatest ever,"This countdown, 4 discs in all, was terrific. It wasn't perfect- I did have a few quibbles with some of their choices. Gale Sayers was not better than Emmitt Smith, for example. Having said that, this is well worth watching. The producers put the selections in a great format--the players' careers were usually covered by a former teammate, coach, or rival player (my personal favorite was Joe Klecko's overview of John Hannah's career, No.24) This format provided a more comprehensive look at some of the players from the 1960s or earlier. I feel like I actually knew a lot about Bob Lilly's career, for example, although I never actually saw him play. If you're a serious football fan get this ASAP."
5,TOP 100 NFL PLAYERS,Bought this for the grandson - this was one of the only things he really asked for - for Christmas - He was so excited. He and his buddy sat and watched the whole DVD immediately and he has watched it a couple of more times.
4,nfl top 100 players,"the 100 best players of all ages in beautiful movies of the NFL.the DVD is very good but the extras are very poor. is better if in the extraare listed some great players not enclosed in the first 100, such as sterling sharpe,fred biletnikoff,swann,stalworth and franco harris."
5,a must for any ray price fan,this is really a special album withsome traditional some fun and some just love songs.
3,TUNNEL VISION,"The four Baldwin brothers are a mixed bag of variable talents: Alec is probably the best, having managed to get meatier and more accessible roles; Stephen is good when he uses his lethargic delivery as part of the character rather than just looking bored; William is the least seen, and I'm apathetic about him; that leaves Daniel, who tries hard to be like Alec, but usually ends up just being a non-descript actor of less than impressive talent. He directs and stars in this okay little thriller. He's a security guard who's out to recapture diamonds stolen by the irrepressible Kim Coates (hammy and delightful as usual). The problem with TUNNEL is its one dimensional, derivative script and action scenes that aren't very action-packed. The movie seems eternally long, and its double ending a bit hard to swallow. Mark Camacho (looking like a pudgier version of Vincent d'Onofrio) offers some welcome relief in a key supporting role. Not awful, just not great."
5,one of the most helpful medical books I have ever purchased,"I learned disrhythmia interpretation in a weekend with the help of this book, and still pull the book off the shelf ten years later to brush up on my skills. I recommend this book for anyone needing to learn and understand how to read a cardiac monitor."
1,This book is useless.,This is the most confusing and hard to read textbook I have ever used. We used this book during our paramedic class and even the instructors hate it. If it was not the only book the state would allow us to use we would not have use it.
5,Very good,"This book gives many practice examples. It is perfect for a person new to ECG rhythm recognition.After completing this book, I recommend Huzar'sBasic Dysrhythmias: Interpretation and Management - Text and Pocket Reference Package (Revised Reprint). It reviews the basics, but goes much faster (with fewer practice strips) -- but more importantly it goes into much more depth. It also delves into 12-lead interpretation much more than other similarly titled books."
4,Basic Arrhythmias,The information the book puts across is good.There are a couple of issues with the rythms which have to be reviewed. It is certainly a book worth having.
2,Not worth the money,"It has the look, weight, and price tag of a text book, but contains such a small amount of information it could have been a classroom handout. This book begins with a BASIC description of the ""rules"" for interpreting rhythms, which is a very small portion of the book. There is nothing wrong with this section, and as far as I can tell the information is accurate. The rest is made up of practice strips (Lead II only, one per page), that the reader is supposed to interpret.The reason I felt this book deserved two stars (as opposed to none), is that it came with somewhat useful flashcards for practicing rhythm identification. My recommendation is to use it if it is provided for you, but don't spend money on it. All of the information in it (and MUCH more), as well as thousands of practice strips, can be found for free on the internet."
5,Great Instructional book,Easy to understand and really makes sure you learn the important stuff. Lots of practice strips too that are very applicable to real life ekg's. Helped me get through medic school.
4,excellent,"this book was exactly the book i was looking for, this is one of the best book to learn EKG's from,"
2,Text or workbook?,"I believe it's technically called the Socratic method, but I call it the ""guess what I'm thinking method"" of teaching. Regardless of the content, this text is written in numbered paragraphs with random words missing within. The missing words are in a column to the right of the text, like it's a quiz. I find this distracting and unhelpful. There are parts of the book that actually are quizzes, which is fine, but leaving out every instance of the word ""electrical"" on a page and putting a blank line in its place is just teaching me to work through frustration. Maybe that's the point, but I doubt it."
4,Great Reference Book,"I purchased this book for one of my students who is currently in a paramedic program. Excellent reference for them, they really love it and it was for a great price too."
3,Maybe it's just me,"I really didn't like this book, and I'm not sure if it is just the topic that I struggled with or if it was the text. I had a tough time reading the book...I didn't like the blank lines to fill in the answers, it seemed distracting to me trying to learn the information and having to stop and fill in the blank as I go along.As far as the information, it was really very compelete and there were A LOT of practice strips in the text. That part I did find useful. It does take a lot of practice in class, in the field and in clinical settings to learn the cardiolody and ekg intrepretaion. If you can get passed the fill in the blanks part, or if that doesn't bother you than it seems to be a very good book. It just didn't seem to suit my learning style."
4,"Fine, dynamite first effort from the Boys","I still remember the Boys' first album. They were a very young group with the members being 11, 12 or so, but they had a dynamite album in 1988. Strong numbers such as the ultra funky Dial My Heart dominate this album. For LA and Babyface to produce a fun, melodic first effort for the Boys is an understatement, and it is still one of their best hit records. The rest of the album follows the similar boy meets girl themes and young love, yet the group delivers on every song. I still love Sunshine. Although their later albums sold well, they could not match with the talent that is displayed on this album.Brilliant teen pop long before,NKOTB, Backstreet Boys and NSYNC took over."
5,oh Memories,I remember playing this tape so much over and over until it broke. Then I borrowed my Aunts copy and played it till hers broke. lol. I loved the boys and was in love with Hakeem. Just hearing those songs brings back so many memories of my childhood and me dancing around my kitchen to the music. i'm getting it for my daugher. Love Love Love
4,Teaches good values,"I grew up listening to this album. Although it teaches good values, it is very cheesey sounding in music and speech. It would be great if they made an updated version of it."
4,always a favorite,"Marlo Thomas broke down barriers back when this movie made its debut. The songs are inspiring, and 25 years after I first heard them, I still find myself singing my favorite ""It's Alright to Cry"" by the big teddy bear, Rosey Grier."
5,Free to be You and Me music,"This CD goes along with the 25th anniversary book. It is so much fun to listen to again. The kids in the neighborhood where I grew up, and my brother and sister and I used to put on this production for the parents in the neighborhood. To be able to listen to this again and bring all those memories back is really great."
5,Free to be touching,This album has something for every kid and kid at heart. My kids sat in the back of the car spellbound for the first 10 times we listened to it! They love the music but also the meanings and thoughts. At 4 & 7 they really understand most of what's being said and it's meaning. For me it was quite moving to listen to since I was a child of the late 60's. This album isfull of great talent but more importantly it gets it's message across without pounding it in. GREAT
5,"This is, without a doubt, my favorite children's CD!",This disc never fails to make me happy. A great disc that will make anyone feel like a kid again!
5,Highest form of a compliment!,"The first time I heard the 331/3 RECORD of ""Free to Be,"" I cried through many of the selections. They so perfectly echoed my child-rearing philosophies, and I was thrilled with the talent, cleverness, and charm of each presentation. Additionally, the music was memorable and easily became one's own. My two children and I wore out the record over the years, and it still remains a favorite. Imagine my thrill last night when my daughter asked for the CD for her 22nd birthday! And, clicking in at Amazon, here it is! WONDERFUL! and thanks."
1,Outdated and Whiney,"I rememeber hearing this as a child and kind of liking it. Now as an adult and understanding the total message of this music I must say I am sorry I bought it. There is a tremendous amount of whining. And no, it's not OK for a boy to have a doll in the sense that they describe, sorry liberal hearts! There is entirely too much talking and not enough happy, playful music. The only saving grace is there are two decent songs on this CD, but still not worth buying it. Spend your money elsewhere like John Lithgow's Singin' In The Bathtub."
5,Oldie but Goodie,"This album really takes you back... I remember some of the songs from when I was little and now my daughter gets to enjoy the fun too. There are songs and skits and each one has a positive message about being yourself, being confident in yourself and respecting others. Even though it was written in the 70's, the message is still relevant. And it's so cool to hear all the celebrity voices you know and love."
3,a landmark in children's albums,"If you were a kid in the 1970s', chances are you had a copy of this little gem. FREE TO BE YOU AND ME was created by Marlo Thomas as a teaching tool for children. Filled with great songs and comedy bits from a galaxy of stars, the album teaches gentle lessons about sharing, self-belief and tolerance.Marlo Thomas originally created the album because she wanted her niece to have something that celebrated just being a kid, but this album was proudly adopted by an entire generation, and songs like ""It's All Right to Cry"", ""Parents are People"", and ""William's Doll"" became anthems in the schoolyard. Parents who grew up with the album now have the opportunity to pass it along to their own children, thanks to this reissue from Arista Records.Highlights include husband/wife team Shirley Jones and Jack Cassidy with ""Girl Land"", Carol Channing with ""Housework""; and Marlo Thomas with ""Ladies First"".Totally magic.[Arista/Legacy 82876 80313 2]"
5,Extremely important record for children,"This is one of the seminal records of my generation, and it is also a very important album for parents, especially of daughters, to have. The album, with performances by celebrities such as Marlo Thomas, Alan Alda, Rosie Grier, and a particularly warm and personable Diana Ross, includes songs that instill pride, intelligence and equality among boys and girls."
5,Beautiful and touching,"I just ordered this CD and listened to it start to finish. Like some other reviewers here, I cried and was deeply touched by many of these songs. I was 2 when this album came out and remember hearing it throughout my childhood at different times. Its message is timeless, though the album's positive, progressive message shines through with a radiance that is no less dim nearly 30 years later. On the album's liner notes, Gloria Steinem expresses regret (her only one about this record) that her generation didn't have this to grow up to. I am proud and honored that we did -- and if you're reading this and have children, I hope you share this with them and teach the messages contained within."
5,Practical Pam,My kids love the music and think the skits are hilarious! I also enjoyed this when it came out as a record in the 1970's.
4,Thought that it was good.... BUT...,"no Michael Jackson on the CD.... I thought that the CD holds up well aside the little oversite... Listening to Alan Alda and even Carol Channing on the CD was a real treat too.I liked the title track FREE TO BEE YOU AND ME, as well as WILLIAM'S DOLL, and IT'S ALRIGHT TO CRY... I think that this is a nice little album to share with the kids and for us adults to sit back and reflect on our times in growing up...If you listen closly... You can hear little pops on the soarce tape too... Overall.... a great way to preserve memories that can be passed down through the years...."
4,Love the CD and want to bring it to the stage,"I first heard this on 8-track when I was very young and loved it then and think its still a great collection now on CD. I know that Marlo Thomas also created a stage version, and as the managing producer of a theatre company in Omaha NE I am anxious to find out more information and bring this show to the stage here. If anyone has any information on it, please email me at StagesJRD@aol.com."
3,Marlo Thomas & Friends- Free to Be You and Me,"Most of the songs are delightful and positive. I do have one serious problem with one track however. The ""Housework"" track promotes a negative attitude toward housework that should not be instilled in anyone. My wife and I enjoy housework! Obviously, one's attitude toward housework is subjective, and therefore, should not be presented as a fact that mommy and daddy hate housework, and so will you when you grow up. Since we all have to do housework, we should promote a more positive attitude toward it. There is dignity in all honest work, including housework. I want my children to learn to enjoy housework. The track should focus primarily on the cooperative, fun, and rewarding aspects of housework. Incidently, if you want THE MOST FABULOUS (6 stars) children's music audio/video, check out Parachute Express' ""Feel the Music."" Our entire family dances and sings to it every day! It is absolutely fabulous! Ron Schlegel."
5,brought back memories,"I was so excited when I saw this offered on the website! My mom bought the album many years ago when my sister and I were kids. We used to sing and dance all over the living room! My daughter is just 4 months old, but hopefully she will enjoy it just as much as I did. I played it for her (she has the First Years CD Player that attaches to the crib) and started singing along with it. My husband commented that I must have heard it before. I was just thrilled that I still remember all of the words. ""William's Doll"" has always been one of my favorites."
4,Free to Be You and Me CD,"The Free to Be You and Me TV special was one of my childhood favorites, as was this album. (I actually still have the vinyl album my mom bought for me 30 years ago!) I introduced my 4 year-old daughter to the video, and she immediately fell in love with the soundtrack. So I purchased this CD for her and it has become the only thing she wants to listen to during any car ride. The only thing that is disappointing to me is that not all of the songs are exactly the same as what is on the video... not that they aren't good, they're just not the same. While my daughter doesn't seem to mind, I have to admit I prefer the versions on the video. There are a lot of extras on the CD that aren't on the video as well, which is a bonus. Overall, this is a great CD to own if your child loves the video/DVD."
5,Like the CD? Try the DVD!,"A little over a year ago I saw a retrospective on Michael Jackson that showed a brief clip of his performance in ""Free to Be..."" and was suddenly struck by a flood of fond memories of watching the same program some 20 years ago in public school. A couple frantic Google searches later and I found the DVD available for purchase.Suffice to say that the video in question brought huge smiles to a lot of friends and relations for whom I've screened it over beers and smokey treats (as well as juice boxes and popcorn with my now 7-year-old son).The left-leaning messages in this collection of songs, cartoons and short skits were never more relevant and thought-provoking.If you like the soundtrack - and apparently, most of you do - I highly recommend that you splurge for the DVD. Good, clean liberal propaganda gets no cuddlier than this!"
5,songs,They were good but did not get song for you did not download.But overall it was a good pick for mp3s.
5,kids like it too,"I remember loving this record when I was young, and my kids enjoy it too. The first listen inspired a rousing debate among my car's back seat passengers about whether the album's message was old news (so boys cry, big deal, everyone knows that) or whether people still needed to hear it."
5,*With love to my kids*,"I listened to this record when I was a little girl and loved it! I would spend hours singing the songs and quoting the stories. Now, 19 years later, I'm having a child of my own and I can't wait to share this album with him! This is the best of the best! I would certainly recomend it."
3,wish we liked it more,"Perhaps if my daughter was older (she's 3 1/2) she'd get more into this cd. But frankly, there's not enough ""music"" and it simply doesn't keep her interested. Even I, who had it as a child find myself fast forwarding through it. Save this one for the over 7 set."
3,Okay but definately 70's sounding,"I remembered this from childhood so I bought it. It's okay but you don't want to listen to it over & over, the songs and skits get irksome after the first run through. Not actually all songs, some short skits - a lot to do with gender equality wich is good but not alltogether entertaining... I prefer Billy Jonas - What Kind of Cat Are You!!!"
2,"Even as a child, I hated it","Perhaps in 1972 this was a bold statement. But even then, as a nine-year-old, I despised the self-righteous but whiny tone in almost every song. Of course men and women have equal potential, and a just society must recognize that. But this album is only a celebrity vanity project: it is about feeling morally superior, not about changing anything.................When I remember this album, I think of John Belushi in Animal House, when he hears the smarmy soulfulness of a campus bard. If you don't know what he does, get that video for your kids instead of this record. At least that is genuinely funny, unlike this humorless propaganda."
2,Begs more questions than it answers,"I read a ton of the reviews and decided to check this CD out at the library to listen to it before buying. I was not one of the nostalgic parents who remembered this from childhood. After listening to it, I decided not to buy it. I REALLY did not care for this CD. Not only did I feel there was too much talk and not enough music, but the talk itself begged questions that probably don't even cross the minds of your average 2-3 year old (such as the ""girls are just as good as boys"" theme)-- your girl won't even wonder if she's as good as a boy if you don't make a ""thing"" of it and just treat her right. Anyway, this CD bugged me a lot because of issues like that."
1,Quit Living in the Past,"I wish I could have read my review before reading all these hippies talk about how great this album is... I was born in the mid 70s and this album means nothing to me, except something that maybe my parents older siblings would like to listen to because it brings back memories of their childhood. Maybe I haven't listened to the lyrics as closely as I should have, but the music is so damn annoying I can't get past that to listen to the lyrics... hearts love flowers were a time of the past. If you really like the musical Hair, then you will like this album."
1,I was the blues,"very poor performance due to age of mr. dixon. i was embarrassed to watch one of the original greats of the blues looking like a bufoon. you will not be entertained. save your money. actually, buy little walter's greatest hits with the $ you were going to spend on this."
1,Not What Expected,"After reading the Amazon reader reviews, I was expecting the book to contain much more depth into the subject. Besides the few interesting stories, the business-book fluff was rampent. We've read all that stuff before. The book offers little insight into a subject that I belive is well worth writing about."
4,A very good CD,"I bought this CD after hearing ""Old Fat Boat"" and ""McKeon's Coming."" I found these weren't the best songs on the CD. ""Mrs. Macdonald's Lament,"" about the death of the fishing industry and how some men refuse to accept it, is thought-provoking. ""Frankie On The Sheepscot"" makes me want to put on a sweater even in the middle of summer since the image of fishermen working in a blowing Maine snowstorm is so vivid. Bok's singing of ""Western Boat"" while not as good as Stan Rogers' version (called ""Cape St. Mary"" on the CD ""For the Family""), is a better than average folksong. The only song that I don't like is ""Peter Kagan And The Wind,"" a telling of the silkie legend. It just goes on and on and on (it's over 15 minutes long).""North Wind's Clearing"" is a CD that I listen to more than most others that I own."
4,Grew on me!,"I bought this for my husband some years ago, and at the time, I really didn't like it at all. Since then, the album has grown on me, and I find I enjoy it much more now.The songs are not sea shanties; they are songs about fisherfolk and boats and the sea. Some are poignant (Peter Kagan and the Wind), while others are jolly (Liverpool Handy/I'se the By). All have a stoic, weathered, timeless feel to them that surely depicts those who dwell alongside the ocean as well as, if not better than, the lyrics themselves."
4,Forgotten opera,"Paisiello was justly famous in his day as a composer of opera. Opera buffs may know this one. I learned of it through his more famous Barber of Seville. It is a serviceable opera very nicely performed. If your looking for an opera performance down a long forgotten by-way, this is a chance to see and hear something you will not see on a American stage any time soon !"
3,Gift for grandson,He loves the kit and uses it all the time. A perfect starter paint kit for a young model maker.
5,A great solution,"The Harmony 670 has proved to be very functional and a solution to my problems of multiple controllers and frustrated users.I thought it seemed a bit difficult to program for a real non-techie but not unreasonably so if you have any familiarity with computers at all. You MUST have an internet connedtion to get it set up.The back-lit keys are wonderful. Once programmed, it seeps to be almost psychic in supplying the right fix when things get out of sync. I have used it for a month and a half and I have spare AAA cells on standby but so far I haven't needed them. I would buy it again and I have recommended it to my friends."
4,Best remotes got better,"Harmony wrote the book on IP programmed remotes.This unit gives you most of the power of that system, at a very reasonable price."
4,Don't use the software that comes with it to configure it!,"I can honestly say that I hated this remote and was planning to return it. The Logitech software was far too limiting in what it allowed you to do. Then I found a link that someone mentioned online tohttp://members.harmonyremote.com/This allows you to log in using the same user id that you set up in the Logitech software, but now you can actually configure the remote (move/rename LCD commands, as well as a host of other options not available in the Logitech software).Now we love it.As for items getting out of sync (TV not on/off at the right time), I set an LCD button in each activity to toggle power to the tv (or dvd player, etc), and changed the ""power settings"" for each device to keep it on all the time. Works perfectly and replaced 5 remotes. The device timing seems to work best on my equipment when set to 100mS, 500mS was too slow and made the remote seem sluggish."
4,Device good software fair support poor,This remote seems capable of doing everything. Commands not in its database can be learned from another remove. The software allows you to do most things but it could use a lot of work to be easier to use. One bad feature is that your data is stored on the harmony web site and hence they know what you are doing and you cannot back out any changes. I have tried to contact support but found I do better by myself. One scary thing was that support said I had already fixed my problem because they looked at my data. I would recommend this remote for anyone somewhat technically savvy who has to control multiple devices at one time.
5,Nice product,"As with my previous Harmony remotes, this was very easy to program using the Mac software. It nicely transferred over settings from my old remote (659H).I prefer the Black and White Screen models of the Harmony to the one color Harmony that I have.. The resolution on my 880 is really marginal.. and that one has problems with settling on the charger."
2,"Great remote, but went through 2 remotes in a year and gave up","Great remote -- had all my rarely listed devices- easy to set upBUT remote (1) failed after 6 months with stuck keys. Remote (2) failed after 5 months with a broken solder joint on the screen (every other line dead)..Logitech customer service was super difficult to deal with and wasted hours of my time, so I gave up after the 2nd one died.Great idea, software, etc.Mediocre customer service for the price, poor robustness for the use model."
1,Total waste,"This is our second Logitech product. The first one worked fine. This one, after only a couple months of use, is now totally broken. Neither Amazon nor Logitech will accept a return. What a waste."
2,"Remote's ok, Customer Support is abysmal","This was my initial venture into the world of the Harmony Remote. Out of the box, one of the buttons was unresponsive.After a long call with an abrasive tech at Logitech, I was told my problem would be submitted to their RMA department and I would receive their decision in 3-5 business days, even though the remote is under warranty. If my request for service was approved, they would repair the remote and return it to me in 3-4 weeks. Irritating.I would otherwise be happy with the remote, and would continue to use it if it worked properly. As is, however, I can only recommend this product if you can purchase it locally along with a replacement plan, as dealing with Logitech itself is obnoxious at best. This is not the first time I have run afoul of Logitech's customer ""service"", but I just couldn't resist trying the Harmony."
3,Not as well laid out as other Harmony remotes,"I bought this remote and then returned it. The problem isn't with the features but with the physical layout. The center buttons for Up/Down/Left/Right are contained on a single button that can be pressed on multiple sides (with the select button in the middle). The issue is that this button is way too close to the Play/Pause/Stop/etc. controls that surround it, making it awkward to use. If you have a DVR or digital cable and need to move around on an on-screen menu it gets annoying very quickly. On top of this the button has a very cheap feel to it making me wonder how long it would last.Another related issue with the remote is that the volume and channel up/down buttons are too near the bottom of the remote for quick access.Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Harmony remotes, but in my opinion this version just doesn't live up to their usually high design standards."
5,Logitech Harmony 670,"So happy we bought off of Amazon. This product is great and we love it. It also was so much cheaper than at the retail store. We will continue to buy from Amazon, in fact we are buying one for my son for his birthday."
4,Go For It,"Like many people, we have at least 6 remotes to operate our entertainment center. I usually wouldn't spend this amount of money for a something like a remote control, but after using it, I would do it again and would tell others to free themselves from multiple remotes. It was easy to install the software on the computer and set up the remote. The initial set up, once the software was installed probably took about 20 minutes. It did require a little bit of resetting a couple times just to get it the way we like it, but it was fairly simple. I'm especially impressed at how well the remote operates all the features of our DVR. You can also program buttons for specific tasks, such as easily accessing the recordings from the DVR. It couldn't be easier to operate the remote. Want to watch tv? Just press the top 'watch tv' button and all the necessary components turn on, and when you are finished watching, press 'off' and all the individual components switch off. I would recommend this remote."
4,LOVE IT.,Works great. PC interface makes this unit a breeze to configure.Highly recommend for novice users.
4,Harmony makes life simpler,We recently purchased the Harmony remote and are very satisfied with the product. It is much easier dealing with only one remote!
5,Wonderful product,Very easy to program and to use-wonderful product that will get rid of the need for 10 different remotes!!!
5,Great product.,"I highly recommend that any one with more than two different devices purchase a Harmony 670. I had my A/V person program it for me so I can't review how easy it was to program. However, I can say without hesitation that once it's programmed it's a piece of cake to use.I finally can see my coffee table!"
2,Fragile remote,"The Logitech Harmony remotes are technically useful, but for a family with children, they are too fragile. Ours broke in a week."
1,Piece of junk,This remote is a piece of junk. the buttons are very poorly designed. stopped working in two months. had to call support wait long time was transferred from level 1 to level 2. finally after two hours of waiting on phone they are shipping me a new one.
4,I purchased this as a gift for my parents and for myself,Logitech Harmony 670 Universal RemoteI purchased this as a gift for my parents last year. They have been using it for the last year and they love it. I love it as well because before I purchased the remote for them I was getting at least 3 phone calls a week concerning how to watch tv /dvd's/ cable etc...It has a feature in which if one of the devices did not turn on with the rest it will trouble shoot it for you (if the receiver does not turn on you click on trouble shoot and it will walk you though tuning it on with a click of a button) I have not had any phone calls concerning operating their home theater setup in over a year.Great remote for parents or friends who have trouble operating multiple devices.
5,harmony usage,"Having recently purchased the Harmony 670 Universal Remote I highly reccomend this product. We set up a home theatre with xbox, reciever, blue ray, LCD HDTV, DVD and with one button you can switch from one to the other adjust the surround sound, eject the DVD etc. Put all your remotes in the draw and use one. Its simple and easy and you can read the print on the buttons.Ray Collins NC"
3,Decent but Disappointing,"I bought this after some serious research into the nearest replacement for a TiVo remote with some added features. This one fit the bill and came highly recommended by other users.Electrically, the Harmony 670 is fine. It does everything it's supposed to do and can control my hard-to-control plasma screen, TiVo, Comcast (Motorola) DVR, stereo, and so forth.Alas, the mechanics are poor. The buttons are too small and too wobbly to be comfortable, or even reliable. They seem loose and poorly connected, so that some button pushes register and some don't. I get too many unwanted ""double clicks"" and too many clicks are ignored.It's a shame, because the electronics and software are fine. The one thing you CAN'T change, the buttons themselves, are the only drawback. Logitech could have made them about 50% bigger and wasted less ""white space"" between the buttons."
2,Good Start but not there yet,I have had the Harmony 670 for about a month. I can see where they are going with it but it definitely needs improvement to make it useful. The set up was not bad and it handled most of my hardware. It did not handle my RF direct-tv receiver and it could not get the line-in on my Sony vcr to work correctly. I have worked around both of these problems but the main difficulty with this unit lies in the overall design. The buttons are tiny and very close together. The button labels are nearly unreadable because the font is so small. My eyesight is not perfect but I have no problem reading the newspaper without glasses. To read the labels on the harmony I have to have full light and magnifier glasses. Every logiteck device I own has been a delight to use but this thing will probably end up in the closet before long. This is a classic case of function suffering for form.
5,Harmony has the best remotes,"This is my second Harmony remote, and it is even better than my 1st one, the buttons are exactly where I want them and the remote fits nicely in your hand. The last one used to eat some batteries but I can overlook that. The best thing is the programation of the remote through a software, I just tell the software the model of all my video and audio equipment and then I create my shortcuts to watch TV, listen to music, watch DVDs... For me, there isn't a better remote than the Harmony."
1,Piece of Junk,"I am on my 4th remote. 3 of the remotes broke when I tried to connect it through the USB port, the other one had a hard fault on the circuit board. Logitech have replaced all of them but it is a pain because I have to use my old remotes when it is not working. When the remote is working it is great."
1,Junk,The usb port on the unit broke at about the 31st day after first showing signs of intermittent connectivity. First bad review on anything I have ever bought. It would have been nice had it been well constructed. I did not abuse it ... it just stopped working.
1,Worst remote EVER!!!!,"I cant believe the performance of a universal remote that cost this much money. I paid over 100 dollars for mine and have tried several times. This thing just will not program my devices. You go through the setup, it says that everything is working, but it doesnt. It never does any of the multi functions its supposed to. The tv function, it controls the volume 1/3 of the way and stops. I have found more functionality in 10 dollar universal remotes than in this thing. Im glad that some people found it useful. But it just consisstantly would not control any of my many devices. Im still toggling back and forth between 5 remotes. A complete waste of money. Very surprised that this came from Logitech."
2,Logitech Harmony Remote,"I purchased this because of the positive reviews it had. I haven't experienced the ""easy"" to program remote. I purchased this quite awhile ago and it is sitting in its box because I am unable to program it to work. It is very complicated when you have extra equipment to enter in such as extra speakers, DVR box. I would not recommend this unless you know somehow who is very good with electronics."
1,Doesn't work well with tivo,"Just got the remote from my son who programmed all my devices, tivo, receiver,dvd,dvd-vcr combo, and projector. While it will work with each item, when you turn on the tv the next day tivo is frozen and has to be unplugged and restarted (5 to 10 minutes). Wondering if anyone else has experienced this with the 670 and tivo.thanks"
3,OK - But kind of gets complicated,Teh software was easy to set up - But customization of the buttons is not as easy. Goof prodcut for teh price - Cannot control RF devices.
3,not compatible with my system,"I was able to get it to control our TV but couldn't ever get it to control our audio system. Even though I tore the packaging when I opened the product, Amazon still gave us a full refund with no questions asked. Amazon really scored big points with us for that, most other companies would have made us keep that product. I want to thank you and tell you I will try to do as much of my shopping as I can on Amazon.Thank You, Watson Family"
5,booker1069,"this remote is the best, turns everything that needs to be on for the task you want. very easy to program and adding extra controls is so easy.I have a new lcd dhtv, cable w/ dvr and hdtv, dvd/cd home theatre system, all a different brand and the remote works great."
4,Great Remote,"This is a great remote, and it replaced a Harmony 659 that died (after 3 years). It does everything as advertised. The buttons are not quite as easy as the 659, but it works exactly the same. It says it has additional features for the PVR, but I still have the hot keys setup, because the included buttons aren't in a comfortable spot."
2,Numeric keys driving me nuts. . .,"Never before have I had as much trouble operating the keys on a remote as I do with this one. When hitting a numeric key (0 - 9), you never really know if it's going to work or not. If you don't depress it firmly enough, nothing happens even though you feel a spongy key click. Press the key more firmly to try and compensate, and you're likely to get the number coming up twice. I can't recall ever throwing a remote across the room, but I've been sorely tempted with this one. It does managed to get all my components turned on at once, but the annoyance is hardly worth it. Logitech knows how to make buttons work properly. My Logitech mouse works great. Hard to understand why they couldn't design buttons that work properly for this remote."
1,garbage,"This remote is nearly unprogramable. It is totally garbage. I got several of these with different models and I am trying to program them for family. The software on my computer crashes every time I try to program. When I do get it to go through, the remote doesn't respond. I'm betting these guys use a dial up modem to control this software.By the way, and FYI, they make you enter your information and they TRACK you before you can even begin programing this piece of garbage. Watch out.This junk is going back to the store tomorrow."
2,Roll the dice,"This remote is very good in setting up multiple components - I had 13 that I needed to combine on one remote. The process and the software worked fine, it just took a little time to get everything together.But be very wary that these and some other lines of Harmony remotes come with a serious hardware flaw that Logitech refuses to recognize - after about 1-2 years, the LCD on the remote turns blank. The remote is still functional, but given the many features that are dependent on the LCD display, it's basically useless. If you call Harmony CSRs they'll give you a 50% off coupon for remotes on their web site, but that price basically mirrors what you can get online elsewhere. So you'll need to spend the full price again.So, if you're willing to gamble that your remote won't break - it's a good unit. Otherwise it's $120 every two years."
2,to much work for a remote,"I have 4 components on my harmony remote. When you hit the on button everything is supposed to come on together. Well, that might happen half the time. Then you have to hit the help button, and turn each component on seperatly. It get very frustrating sometimes, and you have to get off your lazy bottom and actually go to the tv and turn things on or off manually, ""oh the madness"". needless to say I would not buy this remote again."
4,my boyfriend loves this remote,"I had to buy this remote b/c my boyfriend said he couldn't justify paying so much for a remote... I was so sick of having 5 remotes on the coffee table so I said ""fine, I'm buying 't""... Guess what? Now he LOVES THIS REMOTE!!! It's so easy to program. I have a few complaints but it's not enough to pay more money for another brand/model -- for me anyway. Here they are: the actual GLOW button doesn't glow in the dark so it's hard to find. The buttons are a little bit close together.That's it, everything else about this remote is awesome!"
5,Logitech Harmony 670 Universal Remote,"One remote contols everything, even my old A/V receiver. I couldn't get the cable box remote to control the volume on my Samsung HD TV. This product works on all my stuff. Easy to use. Easy to program. Works as advertised."
2,Tecnical but good,"Too technical to make the unit function as a normal remote. With Geek support from a neighbor's son, the unit is now functioning similar to a normal remote. After using the unit for several weeks I am happier, but have requested a second visit from the neighbor's son, as some time the transition from local broadcast to satellite produces a very loud speaker blast and no picture, which send the dog and others for cover. If I can get it do all the functions that Logitech advised it will do I will be very happy and will toss out all four of our current remotes."
3,Harmony 670,The device is very good. But the download could had a better tutorial of the function buttons.I stumbled through the set-up and they still didn't have a section on all the functions of the button on the remote.
4,complicated to program but works well,I had the prior model and upgraded to this model after my daughter chewed on the buttons. I purposely did not go to the 680 because I did not want to worry about charging another gadget. This one works on batteries.This remote requires quite a bit of programming and you need to know each and every model number of the devices you want to control with the remote and the inputs of each. It is very time consuming and difficult for a first time user but once you have all the information needed the program is pretty user friendly.
5,AWESOME!!!,I bought this remote to control:Samsung TV PN50B450B1DSony DVD DVP - NS 700HXbox 360JBL On Stage 200id (ipod dock used for speakers)I had one problem. I have a new Macbook Pro OS10.5 and the included disc had the old software for the remote. All I had to do was visit [...] and download the latest software which was 1/3 the size of that on the disc) and install.The software was a breeze. I tested the remote with all devices and it works perfectly!! I am so happy. I am an even BIGGER fan of Logitech now.Thanks!
2,Horrible Button Layout; Poor Software; Broken after 6mo; Expensive,"It's a good thing this does light up, because you could never find the right button in the dark otherwise. My old Sony plan jane remote is nicer in the dark, and doesn't even light up!Bought this in Jan '09, the display is now broken... inserting fresh batteries will show the Harmony logo and ""Testing..."" for a second, and then goes blank. The remote buttons still work however.Also, the battery cover is badly designed; can become impossible to remove.Your money is better spent elsewhere."
3,Remote is cool. Instructions really suck.,"The remote has simplified things a great deal. It does a great job of turning things on and off. However, the instructions for the fine tuning of buttons on the Logitech 670 leaves much to be desired. I guess the company figures absolutely anyone who purchases this product has enough computer savvy to not have issues. Gimme a break!"
2,Eats batteries,"Easy to program (as advertised) and controls all my ""stuff"" great. Problem uses 4 batteries every week! Contacted customer service. They are very friendly and helpful,was told to reprogram to slow glow feature to 5 seconds. This did increase battery life-to 2 weeks, not acceptable in my book. Wish I had purchased the Harmony one, which sits in a charging station and has a battery status icon."
3,Great when it works...,"Remote is great when it's working properly... However, I had two of these fail with the exact same problem: The LCD display stops working and goes completely blank. The buttons still work but you just lose all context with what you are trying to do without having that display. The first failed after a couple of months, the 2nd lasted a bit longer but still much too early for a product at this price (less than a year). Getting it replaced with a Harmony 700-- hopefully I'll have better luck with that!Logitech makes good stuff... usually"
5,Web Based Remote update ROCKS!,"Being web based is the smartest thing for remotes I have ever found. The Harmony Remote web interface is extremely easy to update. And it works great with my MAC OSX operating system. (It also works great with Windows)I started using Harmony Remote in 2001 when they were still Intrigue Technologies. Then Logitech bought them; they got bigger with no loss of product quality. I upgrade my remote because I want to not because it breaks down. (I went from the 768 to the 880 because I wanted the rechargeable charger for convenience.)BUT THE BEST THING IS THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE.Seriousy, if you ware looking for a universal remote that that is easy to set up and easy to update- you gotta buy the Harmony Remote!"
2,It's all about the buttons!,"I really, really wanted to like this remote. I love what Harmony started years ago, love the company - and products - that Logitech has always been, so this is a difficult decision to rate this remote so poorly. This was to replace our remote for our Motorola DVR, as well as DVD, TV, CD player. I wish Harmony had taken a page out of the Motorola handbook in designing this product and put big obvious buttons - with different shapes, and-or colors - on it, like ""MY DVR"", or ""+ day"", or ""- day"", or ""INFO"", ""Guide"". Instead, we get just about all the buttons looking and feeling the same with not much thought into intuitive layout. It was with much sadness that I returned this remote; I'm still waiting for the perfect remote. Oh, but the setup could not have been easier with the web page and all! Sorry Harmony."
1,Does not work,I have a very simple setup with no technology older than three years and this remote could not control my devices properly. I like Logitech and am a big fan of their trackballs and keyboards but this product let me down.The remote has Action keys which when pressed power up numerous devices and set them correctly for use. But these action keys were never able to change my TV's input properly. Everytime I would power up it seemed that it randomly selected an input. Then some times it would get into a mode where it would start cycling my TV on and off based upon key presses that had nothing to do with the power.Outside of the problems that I had it did have some other peculiar behaviors that I did not like.I was very disappointed with Logitech.
1,Remotely good,"Good remote. Family broke it. Bought new one.New unit defective. OVER 1 hour on the phone to get to tech support who didn't know what ""System Error 1"" was.Level 2 support said unit was faulty. ""Someone will call you back in about 2 weeks to set up RMA.""An hour on the phone so I can wait 2 weeks and THEN they'll issue an RMA?Doesn't matter how good it is... that's unacceptable."
1,Incompatible with modern operating system,"Three people in my family attempted to install this computer on 3 separate computers for approximately 2 hours of total effort.Although Windows XP found an unknown USB device, the program would not interact with the controller, so we could not set it up.Next we turned to 2 Macintosh laptops running the most modern operating system (10.5.6). The software was supposed to work for systems 10.3 and above. 2 computers, 2 independent efforts by tech savvy college students, and no luck. By the way, system 10.3 hasn't been the standard in 3 or 4 years....the program updated itself, but still didn't run.The troubleshooting guide wasn't helpful for us either. We walked through their various suggestions but it was no help.We hung up after being on hold with customer support for over 20 minutes (never got to talk with anyone) and returned the device."
2,Screen died,"Setup was a little complicated, of course, but once it was set up it worked fine -- until the screen died. Most functionality is not available without the softkeys on the screen. Battery contacts have always been spotty, now it's completely dead -- even with new batteries it doesn't work at all. For the price, the performance is terrible."
4,"Very functional ""CLICKER""","THIS IS A VERY GOOD REMOTE. EVERYTHING WAS EASY TO SET UP. VERY GOOD CONTROLL OF VARIOUS ITEMS. EVEN THE WIFE GIVE IT AN ""A""."
4,Flexible remote,"A few challenges getting it set up correctly, but works everything fine now. Nice to have one remote."
4,Awesome,"I am so glad I purchased this remote. I was so sick of my husband having 6 remotes that each only could be used for one or two functions. This remote can turn on your receiver, cable box, TV, and put the TV on the correct input all with one click of a button. Awesome. We've tried other universal remotes that proved to not be so universal. But this one really is. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because it can't be used to control the PS3. But I don't care about that. Good-bye excess remotes and hello Logitech Harmony 670! It was a Christmas gift for my husband but it's turned out to be a Christmas gift for me too. :-)"
4,Harmony works,This is the second one I've bought over the last 5 or so years. They work as advertised and the folks at the help desk are just great. I have a couple of off breed devices and they had a data base to add them. All I can say is to relieve the frustration of 1st time users do not hesitate to use the contact them telephone number. You may have to be a little patient with the off shore accents but otherwise they do help you.
1,Display failed within first month--poor support.,"I bought the Harmony 670 in late December. By mid January the display occasionally would freeze partially drawn, but we thought nothing of it since any function that could change the display still worked. Less than two weeks later the display stopped working altogether while all other functions still seemed fine. The batteries were still going strong, and the device had been handled well.Logitech tech support sent instructions to update the firmware but this did not help. They requested my contact information in that message, but my response--twice sent--received no reply [Update: beyond the initial reply, Logitech's responses were dated FIVE DAYS LATER!].Since the device failed within Amazon's return window, I'm washing my hands of it. Overall, had the Harmony 670 continued to function properly, I would easily have rated it four stars."
4,"As good as expected, but...","It's really an impressive system with web-based programmability, activity-based interface and virtually unlimited IR library. And the 670 finally provides the DVR buttons that were never quite right on the other models. But the programming software really needs a new rev. They're so fanatic on ""wizard-ry"" that you can't navigating to a particular setting without going through so many steps you lose your place. Also, the mini-USB jack on mine broke, but they're sending me an advance replacement (hopefully) so I can't complain too much about a little manufacturing flaw."
3,poor rocker design,Overall I like the product although it has one of the worst rocker buttons of any remote I have ever used.
2,Wasted too much money,"I've purchased a total of three harmony remotes in my lifetime, but never again! Sure, I love the way you can program their devices from a pc. But I'm unhappy with their build quality. First, on any of their remotes, such as the 670, that have black ink on top of clear buttons (in order to have back-lit keys); well, the ink eventually wears off, especially on the volume and channel buttons. This has happened of two of my three remotes!So, to avoid continuing to have this problem I moved up to their ""xbox 360"" remote. Well, the ink still wears off numpad buttons, but at least the channel and volume buttons would be good to go. But, in less than a year, the + channel button on the right doesn't do anything when I press it. I contacted Logitech but they wanted money to fix it.No problem, I won't ever give Logitech any more money for their remotes.So, be forewarned; as for the ink wearing off the buttons, it seems to be a problem on soft buttons and not the hard buttons."
4,Solid universal remote!,"The Harmony 670 is easy to setup, comfortable to use, and works great. Love the help menu that walks you through any problems with a simple set of questions. I have run into situations where the ""one-touch"" activity buttons have not worked perfectly, but for the most part they greatly simplify the multi-device setup. It is great how you can specify which device you want to use for volume or channel buttons for each activity. I recommend this for anyone sick of marching through the multi-step process for watching a movie, listening to music, or watching TV. It especially works wonders for guests and babysitters."
2,Logitech 670 Remote,"The product description as well a various reviews indicated this remote would do what I wanted in the most efficient and least number of steps for controlling my plasma TV,etc. The programming steps are a real pain. I never could get the remote to link with the cable box remote (Time-Warner) or find a code that would work. It took many tries to get the other remotes to sync with the Harmony. Even when I got most units to work more steps were needed to turn on the TV, cable box, etc. than with a much older RCA universal remote as well as the original cable remote. I actually had a much easier time programming my Marantz amplifier remote to pretty much do the same thing that I was hoping the Harmony would do. A cheap universal remote purchased at a grocery store would work better than the Harmony."
1,How can smart devices be so dumb?,"I can't express how utterly disappointed I am with this remote. It's overly complex in trying to make life simple. Getting the remote to properly interface with my Sony blu-ray player was an exercise in frustration. First of all, it's ridiculous that the setup software for the remote did not include blu-ray or hd-dvd in it's menus .....really????? Secondly it's ridiculous the remote needs setup software (I'm sure many will argue this point). Once I got the remote to halfway work with my player it then would not let me add it to the watch a movie action, stating that none of my devices would output video. Why is this remote telling me what my devices can and cannot do??? Am I not supposed to be the one telling my remote what to do? There seems to be this move toward building devices that hold your hand and try to be super smart. Unfortunately, I find the result is more and more of these very smart devices end up being extremely stupid."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased the 670 in the hopes of simplifying my remote life. I have four remotes (TV, DVD, receiver, PVR). While the wizard to setup the device was easy and it had my hardware in the database, I have returned the item.Many, many of the keys on my remotes were NOT represented on this universal remote. As a result, I still needed all of my device specific remotes in arms reach. I also felt the hard key placement was not condusive to easy PVR usage.For extremely basic controls of a system, I guess the unit would be OK. But if you have even remotely advanced equipment or need to access the special feature buttons, DO NOT get this remote. Stick with your device specific remotes."
1,"It is to remotes, what ebola is to humans...","Horrible remote. I'm computer savvy, and I love my home theatre, but this remote can not be utilized. First off the software it comes with infests your computer. It's worse than Norton or Realplayer, it puts links on your desktop, on your tool bar, and even puts links in your internet browser. Then it asks you for all of your model numbers. Then it crashes. Then it asks you a bunch of questions. Then it crashes. Then it uploads the codes to your remote. At which point your remote will turn off your t.v., and not let you turn it back on. If you, say, manually turn the t.v. on, about 30 seconds later your remote will turn it off. Awesome."
1,Logitech Harmony is junk,"The setup is tedious, help button useless, telephone assistance a joke. After spending several hours the unit was never capable of playing a dvd. The wait for customer assistance was agonizingly long and provided no solution. I returned the product and will not buy another or recommend one. This from an engineer who builds sets up computers."
2,Harmony 670,"Very laborious downloading proceedure for audio/visual codes. Unit was clumsy to operate, by the time you located the correct buttons to activate the desired functions the television or dvd player had reverted to sleep mode wiping out all your efforts and necessitating starting over. Screen was difficult to see and/or read- too dark, not enough backlighting or contrast. I had better and easier luck with a $10.00 panasonic remote than this expensive monster. I returned the unit."
4,Excellent remote...with a couple of issues,"This remote is fantastic as a replacement for a DVR remote and all of the other remotes (home theater, TV, etc). There are only 2 issues that I have with the remote and, frankly, they are very minor:1) The center ""wheel"" that has the up/down/left/right arrows and ok button in the center is of the clicking variety. So, not only is it sometimes hard to press the direction required if you have large fingers but it also requires a click.2) It took some fine tuning to get it to properly control the TV input and power for a DVD player. In reality, it might have taken 15 minutes extra to get these working properly.I would purchase this remote again, no doubt, as it is easy to use, has all of the features you need to control a DVR, and will control about anything you can find that has a remote."
5,"Delicious Treat, Antioxidants with a slight Buzz!","The perfect mix of dark chocolate and espresso beans, you cant go wrong with this bar, they are organic as well and i love the fact that they believe in helping the endangered animals on this planet, you wont regret giving this chocolate bar a chance!"
3,You may want to try this.......,"I was looking for a tough outdoor analog watch for quite some time, I even considered this model of Luminox. The rotating bezel and polyurethane case always disuaded me. I eventually went to the LL Bean web page and saw that they too sell the luminox brand. LL Bean has a 100% guarantee, no questions asked return policy ( Have not tested the guarantee, but thats what they claim ). I ended up purchacing the Higher grade LL Bean field watch which suspicously appears to be a luminox watch in a standard metal case. Have worn it non stop for three months and I am very happy. You may want to check it out................Just my two cents."
2,Better Choices Out There,"If you want to buy this watch because you think Navy Seals wear it--they don't. If you would like a watch commonly used by SEALs, then buy a Casio G-Shock DW-6600. If you just like the watch, it's okay, but there are better quality divers out there from Seiko and Citizen, and you should check those out. When I bought my Luminox, there were some that were already broken in the case (tritium vials had fallen off the hands). I sold mine a few months later."
4,"Great watch, especially at night","I have worn my Luminox daily for about 8 years. I am nearsighted so seeing a clock on the wall or nightstand at night doesn't work for me. I don't dive or do anything extreme, I just want to have an accurate watch by day and one that I can read at night. It does a great job at that. I'm taking it to the shop today for a new band. After 8 years it is cracked and about to give out. I ordered one on-line to save about $10 bucks, they are expensive as other reviewers have mentioned. When this watch gives out, I will probably buy another just because of the bright night light feature."
5,second,This is the second luminox watch I've purchased. They are the best watches available for men with very busy schedules.
5,Navy Seal Watch,Bought this for my son. He loves it. I read other reviews but so far it has been everything we expected.
2,Quality has declined over the years.,"This is my 2nd one. The 1st one had battery problems; it would just suddenly stop ticking once in a while for a few hours, then start again, even when the battery was replaced.This new one has a plastic back. I guess in the current economy, even Luminox has to cut costs, right?"
1,Disappointed,"Had this watch for three years. It is extremely light with a very comfortable band. I love wearing this watch everyday. However, like many of the folks here have noted...the watch is fragile. Mine has needed the movement replaced twice. Going for a G-Shock, I can't see putting anymore money into this watch."
4,Luminox watch,The watch is just fine. one week after buying the watch it went on sale if i would have bought this at a store they would have given me the sale price.
4,Durable Imortality,"I've had this watch for about ten years, got it secondhand as a kid; had to change the battery once about five years ago. It stood through the rigors of my adolescence in a crappy Los Angeles public school, sustaining minuscule scratches but no major damage throughout all the fights and good times.Only problem I've ever had is with the bezel, though it's entirely my fault. They should be made more difficult to remove - after easily removing it during cleaning, the sumbitch escaped and now I'm left with the ugly metal and plastic pieces underneath. Oh well. I'm just going to cover them in black auto paint and get on with it.Very fine watch, I say. Still works, keeps perfect time, it's durable as heck. Other reviewers or Luminox be damned; these people are either ultraviolent freaks or Luminox's quality has deteriorated lately."
2,"Big Money, Poor Quality","I have owned one of these watches for the past 4 years and replaced the battery once. One day the illuminated part of the second hand fell off and moves loosely on the clock face. The piece is big enough that it was able to jam the second hand stopping the watch. I did not notice for 2 hours. Customer Service was no better, send them $12.00 and the watch and they well call back later and give a price to repair it, no guarantees.Another complaint is the small date, you need a magnifying glass to see the date. Don't Navy Seals care about the date? If you are looking for a watch that ONE Navy Seal guy wore during his daily workouts, and don't care about the date or time, this is the watch for you."
1,In the trash goes #2,"These watches are basically crap! I never read the reviews because I never actually bought one. I found my first one in a river near a Marine base in the Sierras and was impressed that it was working. When it failed (water under the crystal and it stopped working) a year later I sent it in to the company and was told that the warranty could not be validated. I received the second one as a gift. I only wore these watches while camping, fishing, and backpacking. I never wore it diving, and neither one went deeper in the water than 10 feet. The second one just failed. Again, the problem was water seeped in and it stopped working. I can't believe that Navy Seals or even Navy cooks rely on this watch. I would not reccommend that anyone buy the watch."
1,Avoid,I have had two of these watches. I went swimming with them on but no diving. They both stopped over time presumably because the battery needed to be replaced. In both instances I was told they were corroded inside and that a repair would approach the price of a new watch. Who really wants a $200 disposable watch?
2,Not a quality product... stay with a Seiko if you want quality,"My Luminox is 18 months old. I'm not tough on watches at all, so I'm mystified why my Luminox is looking ratty.The crystal is cracked and I never remember any traumatic episode involving this watch. The luminous numbers on the outer dial were wearing off within 2 weeks. I've had better luck than others with the watch band. I bought this watch as a slightly more expensive alternative to a Seiko 5. Frankly, the Seiko 5 would be a better alternative."
1,Luminox as a Christmas present,"I was intrigued by Luminox watches for some time before getting one from my wife for Christmas. I excitedly strapped it on and went about my holiday, awaiting family and friends.It wasn't too long before I noticed that the watch was running slow, and after a few days stopped all together. Contacting Luminox ""Support"" the first time provided no reply what-so-ever. Second attempt four days later I received a somewhat vague ""Our Service Center can help you with this at 401-946-0920 or info@saltzmans-watches.com.""To say I'm disappointed in Luminox, both their product and support, is an understatement."
3,Great Value!,"I had this watch for few days and I have to admit I was bit disappointed at how plain this watch looks. To some of you this watch may look stylish but to my eyes it looks as plain as much cheaper Casio watch. Although the watch is very light and illumination at night is very impressive, this watch is very simple and plain watch. Obviously, I cannot tell you how rugged this watch is or how accurate it keeps time for I had it for short while, however I will recommend against this watch unless you have seen it in person. Trust me watch looks much better in pictures than on your wrist. Having said all of the above it has cool functions such as 200m Water resistent and scratch proof surface and very light band. I am in dillema as to keep this watch or return it...."
1,"The second had keeps falling off. It is a great watch, as long as you never use it!","Would not own another one of these if you paid me. Twice the second hand has fallen off. The seller states that will easily happen if the watch is dropped. Really, a watch that is marketed as one used by and up to the rigors of the Navy Seals? The funny part is, the watch has never been dropped and is treated like it is made out of egg shells. I have owned many watches over the years and never has a second hand fell off any of them once, let alone twice. Do not buy on of these watches, they are pieces of junk!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I purchased this watch a little over a year ago. Mine had the tan background.The watch worked fine until the battery needed replaced about 2 months ago.I had a jewler replaced the battery, and soon after the time ran about 2 minutes slow.I replaced the battery myself, and the watch died.I took it to a Luminox dealer, and they told me the movement needed replaced, and the repair estimate was$97.00.I told them to forget about repairing it.This is suppose to be a Navy Seal watch that should take some hard use?I sure hope the Seals don't actually use this watch.I will never buy another Luminox product!!!Save your money, and buy another brand. This watch is a POS."
4,Good watch at a good price.,"For years, I've used my cell phone to keep time but decided a watch would be more convenient. I'd heard of the Luminox line and liked the look and simplicity of it. All I want is the date and time, don't need a stop watch, altimeter or to know the time in Japan. I'm also a vegetarian and the rubber band was a plus since I don't do leather.Pros:- Lightweight, especially for a watch as big as it is.- Hands glow brightly in the dark with no need to push a button. Easy to see on the nightstand.- Keeps great time.Cons:- The band has a rubber piece to keep the overlap flush. This moves and the band pops out a lot.- The band could be longer. I have average sized wrists for a man and it fits fine but someone with large wrists might have a problem.- The date window and numbering could be a bit bigger.The cons are all very minor and, overall, I really like the watch and would recommend it. Now that I'm wearing a watch again, I can't be without it."
1,"Terrible watch, worse service","Please do yourself a favor and avoid Luminox watches at all cost.I am a firefighter and assumed that a watch good enough for Navy Seals would meet my on the job needs as well. How wrong I was.After less than a year I cracked the crystal by setting the watch on a plastic countertop. Apparently they are not made to handle impact of any kind. Navy Seals must be a fragile bunch.After considerable hassle, the Luminox service center repaired the watch, but charged me an outragous $120 dollars - and it took them all of 16 weeks.Several months later the glow-in-the-dark paint fell off of the second hand and now sits inside the watch housing, getting pushed around by the hands.I like the look of this watch, but the quality is terrible. Even worse, it costs more to fix the frequently broken parts than it costs to buy a better watch.Give your money to a watchmaker with a quality product who cares about its customers - Luminox is not that company."
1,Total Garbage,"I bought this exact model in 2002 for boot camp. i thought i should get the best quality watch for something like that and since it is the navy seal watch i figured it would be pretty good. for daily use it looks cool and lights up insanely bright at night. you would have no trouble telling the time in the dark. now the bad part... on the way to boot camp, the light strip on the second hand fell off! it just rattled around inside. then i got to boot camp and i cracked the face without even abusing the freaking thing. it made me sick knowing how much this stupid watch cost me. i ended up having to go to the store so i could buy a [...] timex ironman watch. i used it through boot camp and still wear it today after 7 years of abuse. i had to change the battery for the first time about a month ago. i say dont waste your money. this watch isnt all that luminox claims it to be. its absolute crap."
2,Okay Product - Expect to buy another in a year,Loved this watch when I first got it - has great styling and was a great backup to my dive computer. Used it for diving here in Alaska. Unfortunately quit working within a year. Quality for the price is pretty questionable. No response from company on fixing it....
2,disappointed,"I read up on this watch and decided to buy it, thinking if it's good enough for a navyseal it's good enough for me. 1 month later the wristband spring that connects the belt to the watch popped off during a basketball game. Ever since it keeps happening when small amount of force is applied. The luminox glow in the dark thing works great but it fell off on one of the hands inside the case. I feel bad for our military."
1,just buy a g-shock,"If there was only 22 1/2 hours in the day this might be a decent watch. This is a good looking watch, but that is about all it is. I wore it mountain biking twice, didn't even fall, and now it is losing about 1 1/2 hours a day. That is very unacceptable. I also never saw anyone wearing anything but a Timex, or a Casio G-Shock in the field while I was in the army. I will see what I can do to fix this novelty item and will probably pick up a G-Shock in the meantime."
2,JomaShop,I bought a Luminox 3000 man's watch from Amazon.com. Amazon.com then used JOMASHOP.com as the supplier. When I went to change the date the beginning of this month (March) I found the crown stem to me very difficult to pull out and turn. Take note that the watch was never abused or damaged in any way. I called JOMASHOP to get a return order for repairs. First off the person I got spoke such broken English I had to have him repeat everything he said. Sometimes several times. The watch is in the two year warranty time frame but JOMASHOP will not back up the warranty. Personally if I buy another watch from Amazon and learn that it is coming from JOMASHOP I won't place the order or return it within the 30 days of purchase. I'm just grateful that it wasn't a high end watch.
2,Good and bad,"I have two Luminox watches. The 3001 was the first and worked great for about 2 years. Then it started to ""lose time"". I figured the battery was going bad so I replaced it. Within about 2 months it did it again. Figured I had a defective battery so I replaced it again. Lasted about 2 weeks. Now it's dead. Additionally, the bezel paint doesn't like mosquito repellant. It ate most of the paint off the bezel. I'm very unhappy about the quality of this particular Luminox. That being said, I also have a 3204 which I love and haven't had a single problem with."
3,Eh....not worth $200,"The first one I received was DOA. Amazon was great and overnighted another watch to me which works. The second hand does not line up with the seconds and the watch just feels cheap. In short....Amazon great....Luminox, stay away."
1,Cheaply made watch!,I'll stay away from this watch cheaply made see my experience with luminox at [...] Broken in so many ways not just the strap even after replacing with a new strap and even the watch itself
1,Non-working watch,"I have had two other virtually identical watches (started out using them as dive watches but wound up using them as my regular watch. The latest one I ordered arrived promptly; I started it up, set it; it ran for five hours and stopped. I reset it; it ran another four hours and stopped; I sent it back, and received a refund promptly. Do't know if I'll try to buy another."
4,Excellent value,"The watch is the lightess I've ever worn. The illumanation of the numbers is excellent. I've only owned the watch for a week. So far, so good."
2,Not very impressive,"Nasty cheap plastic case, very average illumination. It may ""glow"" for years but it's weak. Horrible strap and a load of very dubious nonsense about a Navy SEAL connection. Cheap watch, vastly over-priced. But SEIKO 200m diver. This thing doesn't even have a screw down crown! Casio's have better build quality than this!"
5,Utter goodness...,"Leonard remains master of his domain. America's greatest crime-fiction writer again astounds readers with this collection of short stories. From a washed up baseball player, to an unlikely arsonist, to a lawman whom isn't afraid to use his piece, Elmore Leonard fails to disappoint in any of his nine shorts. A must read for Leonard fans and a great intro book for the noobs. 10 out of 10."
2,a disappointment,These selections are not typical of the great quality of this show. Many of them are whimsical and comedic which is definitely not the strong point of this show.Hope the other releases are more representative of the general high standards of this production.
2,Don't waste your money...,"Unless you're buying this for an[...] old that's just starting to play guitar, don't waste your money - matter of fact, you wouldn't be happy with it then either. ""First Act"" has a cheaper, better sounding amp. It has rattled from day one, doesn't have a mid setting (just bass & treble), and bass can't be turned up past 3 without some MAJOR rattling. Save your money - skip this amp!"
1,"Unsafe, Unreal, Ungood","Okay, porno is porno, and this writer certainly gets the obsessed themes down. But this book stinks! With a sick obsession for socks , odor and feet that oddly seems to be shared by every character, it had me holding my nose. With all these ""socks"" you would think a condom might show up. The repeated graphic description of unsafe safe, forced anal sex and advocacy of closeted lies make this embarassing for the gay community. Shame on Alyson."
5,Kathleen is the best!,"I am a Kathleen Edwards fanatic, so anything she does is alright by me. The live music on this DualDisc is fabulous. (If you've never seen Kathleen live, by all means go see her!) The videos are nothing to write home about, but they are a nice bonus. One caveat, though: If you have a slot-loading CD player--either in your laptop, desktop, or automobile--do NOT attempt to play the music from this CD in your CD player. You might never get the disc out without a costly repair. I absolutely HATE the DualDisc format and am happy that it seems to have died a slow death. Because the discs are thicker than regular CDs or DVDs, they wreak havoc on slot-loading players. Just be warned."
2,"A good intro, but difficult to learn from","I would say that this is a great DVD to see if the tabla is something you want to learn. But as an instructional DVD I found it very lacking. First, it is not broken into lessons of any kind. A student would have to work very hard to extract a learning track from it. Second, the explaination of the verbal drum syllables in interesting, but I could not tell how the ones spoken in the DVD correlated to the written ones in the included leaflet. Lastly, I may have missed it, but I don't think tuning was covered at all. I definitely don't feel that I could learn tabla well, let alone at all from this DVD."
2,Learn Tabla Well by A Pal is far from what the title suggests,"I would not suggest that a beginner buys this product...he or she will be disappointed. Unless you have basic training from elsewhere, you will experience tough times ahead should you depend on this product in your first year. I agree with a review I read that this product is more Like A Pal giving a TV interview. In spite of that I still decided to buy it only to confirm that notion. It does not seem like teaching. I have set it aside while I am learning from others. One day it might kick in usefully."
3,Not thrilled,"Just got this mike 3 days ago. This mike is made very good. As far as sound goes, I'll stick with my EV N/D767a. The sound is not as great as my Shure 58. Maybe just a tee little bit cleaner, but not much. But then again to each his own. Some may like the sound of it. After using my EV for about 2 years no mike sounds as good too me. But that's just me. The Audix sounds muddy. I've worked with the highs,brought down the lows,mids, still the same. Very disappointed after reading such good reviews. I plan on using it as a back up, just in case something goes wrong with my EV. Don't go by this review it may be the right mike for you, it's just not for me. Thanks Amazon for your fast service."
2,If you can't get the dates right...,"If you don't care about biographies containing accurate information, then this book is an adequate bio of this legendary writer. However, I do care about accurate information in my biographies. In doing research on Something Wicked This Way Comes (both novel and film), Weller's book is full of inaccurate dates and other facts. My favorite (regarding the film): ""In 1983 the day before filming began..."" Huh?! The film was RELEASED on April 29, 1983!!! (BTW, filming began in 1981).As I didn't have to concentrate so much on anything else in this bio as I did for SOMETHING WICKED...I have no idea how many other inaccuracies there are. For a general overview of Bradbury's life, this book will suffice, but when it comes to specifics ....look elsewhere."
5,"Thank you, Sam Weller.","Sam Weller pays homage to Ray Bradbury with the same type of nostalgia that this great `teller of tales' used throughout his career. It's this same sentimentality, this same savoring, this adoring love, which made Bradbury's stories more human and literary, that Weller uses to bring the American Icon to life. It's as if Weller fanned the flames of a bon-fire and turned the blaze into a fully raging sun. Yet, instead of burning the skin off the man to look objectively at his bones, Weller puts the skin on Bradbury so that we realize he is human and should be treated as such. The last chapter, either because it was the end of the story or because of the matter it pertained to had me tearing up. Perhaps I'm a sentimentalist, but whatever, this was a great biography, not solely because of Ray Bradbury, but because Weller told it like Bradbury would have wanted it told. I savored every instance within the dust jacket and would recommend it to anyone."
5,The Bradbury Chronicles,"Excellent reading, not just for Ray Bradbury fans, but for all fans of fantasy and fiction, as well as for aspiring authors!"
5,Great way to use the refillable tanks on your Weber Grill,"I cant stand using the small 1lb propane tanks for the Weber Q200 due to the fact that you cant recycle them and you go through them so fast.With this adapter hose, you can hook to a big 20lb propane tank that is refillable therefore saving money and space in a landfill.The larger tanks mean we only have to swap them out every few months compared to having multiple back-up's lying aroundPat Bonish[...]"
5,Weber tank hoze,"Works like a charm. I had a different make before , for my weber but it didnt work properly, This one is perfect."
2,Do not get this one!!,"This particular hose is SO difficult!! It gives a low flame most of the time (I guess from the safety switch in it). I have tried doing what other reviewers have suggested with mixed results (sometimes it would work, sometimes it would not). I called Weber, and they said they now suggest turning the gas on (on the tank, not the grill) at a steady turn, and walking away for 2 minutes before starting the grill (basically do not touch the grill until after the 2 minutes). I tried it one time and it seemed to be better, but who knows, it was only one time to test it out. I just think for this price, it should work flawlessly (at least do what it is supposed to do). The only reason for 2 stars, is because it is convenient (and so much less expensive) to use the hose with a large tank when at home."
3,Alternative Hose for better Price,"I bought the Charbroil Model#4623 46"" adapter hose from Home Depot for $17 (also at Lowe's @ same price). It is the same hose as Weber but much cheaper. I matched both hoses together and both were identical down to the tags and warnings, the only difference was the packaging and price. The hose works well with 20 lb LP tanks and last way longer than the 14.1oz tanks."
3,"Works well, but the squirrels like it too","I can say that these hoses work as advertised, but if you plan to leave it connected all the time (when you aren't there to watch it) and you have squirrels or other hungry rodents, they may chew through it. After they ate my second one, I was ready to give up on using my large tank. Then, I found an alternative adapter, made for a Freedom Grill FG-50, that works for any portable grill that uses 14.1 ounce propane tanks, but is covered in a stainless steel mesh instead of rubber. I hooked it up to my Weber Baby Q and now have a rodent proof hose and am happily grilling again. It's a shorter hose (the FG-50HA is only 3.5 feet long, not 6 like the one from Weber) but that was not a problem for me. Cost of the FG adapter was about the same.If you don't have a squirrel problem, or will be unhooking it when not in use, then this Weber adapter is fine."
3,"Useful, but...","This product is vulnerable to animals chewing through it. Squirrels destroyed mine, and I read someone else's review that said theirs was destroyed by squirrels or raccoons. The splatter from the fat of the meat that I'm grilling gets on the hose and attracts animals. I could wash it every time I grill, or I could disconnect it and bring it inside, but I think insteat there ought to be some tough coating or metal layer built into it to stop animals.The grill (Weber Baby Q) is awesome, but I'd recommend not investing in this hose if you're living in an area with squirrels or racoons. Just buy the smaller tanks and suck up the extra cost, 'coz it'll be cheaper than replacing these hoses."
1,Another squirrel chew with the fire department too!,"We have had this for the year, althought havent really used it much since these past two weeks. Came home tonight to a hissing sound, walked toward the grill and smelt gas. Upon getting a flashlight we saw that the hose had been chewed thru and since we smelt gas we called the fire department who disconnected the hose for it the propane was leaking out thru the hose."
1,SQUIRRELS STILL BIG PROBLEM!!!,"Bought the coils, covered the hose tightly with coils and the squirrels still ate through! I don't understand it. The squirrels didn't touch the hose on my full-sized grill. Don't buy this product--it won't work and is too much of a hassle!!!"
5,Will most likely get again in the future if the squirrels attack it.,We bought the hose to be used with the Q grill. We first started using it with the portable tank which could be very convenient if we bring the grill for camping use. But the portable tank used up very fast. With this hose we are able to hook it up to a regular refillable propane tank. Unfortunately the squirrels (or is it rats?) like to chew on it. I read another review that said the same thing.
3,Not That Easy,"Connecting the hose is simple enough - the connectors only fit one way and the hose is longs enough to reach the tank. There definitely is an issue with using the set up though. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS! After turning on the tank slowly, wait at least a minute to let the pressure build in the pressure regulator (the round thingy) before lighting. Otherwise this won't work - it will be extrememly hard to light and give small flame. Even when lit correctly the pressure regulator ""whined."" This should be a slam-dunk, but isn't."
3,Doesn't work with Q 300,There's no mention of this in the product description. This product won't work with the Weber Q 300 Grill.
3,works ok,"I had the same problems as many others with low flow, but after a call to Weber (very friendly, helpful, and NOT in India) I was good to go. I have found that when turning on the tank you need to simply turn it extremely slow until you hear the gas just starting to flow. Once it has done that for a couple seconds you can turn the valve on at a normal rate. I couldn't imagine doing it a 1/4 turn at a time every time. As long as I am careful to do the slow valve turning, the hose work perfectly. I have been very happy with it and my Q220 grill. It's too bad they can't make the saftety valve a little less finicky. I've noticed in stores that this hose now has a green plastic nut. I wonder if it is an improved version???"
2,Not enough heat,Bought the Weber Q for Christmas. Tried to grill that day. Weber Q doesn't put out enough heat. Seems like the propane doesn't flow well enough in the cold.
1,Animals chew through my hose,"I've had this hose only two weeks and some animal chewed through the hose. I think it was a squirrel. Some of the other reviews say not to let food/grease fall on to the hose, but I've had it only two weeks and my hose is very clean. The squirrels still chewed through the hose. I think Weber used a very tasty rubber or something. Do not buy this hose if you intended to leave your grill outside."
4,"See ya, garage...I'm on the move!","Thanks to this new revolutionary device, I no longer feel like my major life decisions have to be made within a close proximity to my garage. If melancholy and despair should set in anywhere, anytime...it's great to know that thanks to the 20 pound tank adapter hose for Weber's Go-Anywhere Gas Grill, I can act quickly and with resolve.Weber: The first name in solving all your problems. Yes, ALL of them."
4,tip for using this adapter,"When we first hooked up the hose and ignited our weber, it lit right up. But then the flame was uneven and wouldn't stay lit. It turns out that after you hook it up and open the propane valve, you have to wait 60 seconds before igniting the grill. It does say it in the directions, but of course, we didn't read those first."
1,Plugged Hose,After replacing the regulator on my Weber Baby Q Grill I discovered theAdapter hose flow was restricted by a defect & the grill never worked witha 20# tank. Now I need a new hose.
1,$17.00 at Lowes,Not the same brand but it is the same thing... This ain't brain surgery here kids! lets keep it real!
1,Terrible. Don't bother. (Read for update),"I bought this to go with my Weber Q. It worked maybe twice, and now I can't get any gas to the grill. I've tried the reset procedure over and over. I've tried opening the valve of the propane tank over a 10 minute period, then waiting 5 mins before trying to light the grill. Nothing works. Now I have a 20 lb propane tank that's unusable with my grill. My advice, don't frustrate yourself with this product. Obviously with this many people writing that it doesn't work, odds are pretty good you'll be disappointed like we are.**Update: I contacted Weber about this problem and they quickly agreed to ship me a replacement. Apparently there is a known issue with some of the hoses."
5,My baby loves these blocks!,"I was looking for wooden blocks, made in the USA. These blocks are absolutely beautiful and my 10 month old baby loves them. She likes to smack them together and throw them on the floor and they are very durable. I don't worry about her putting them in her mouth either. One thing I will note, if you can order the wagon to put them in, you should definitely do that. I did not realize you could order the wagon with the blocks until after I placed my order. When I wanted to order only the wagon I had to go through another vendor. They are adorable together, and the wagon is a wonderful place to store them when not in use."
5,Great Blocks,"THE PRODUCT:1) These are unsealed wooden blocks with a non-toxic paint. Great for kids.2) They are beautifully embossed and painted. When opening the box, my wife gasped at how beautiful they were. They truly reminded me of my childhood and have the feeling that they've been passed down from a time when toys were meant to last.3) Each side has a different shape, pattern, animal, letter, etc. so there is plenty that you can do with them, besides build.SHIPPING:1) My order was placed and I received shipping notification within 2 hours of placing the order. They arrived 2 days later.OVERALL:These are a great product and remind me that quality products are still available. If anyone is looking for a timeless gift of high quality, these are the ticket."
5,Excellent blocks for little hands!,"We purchased these blocks for our triplets when they were 9 months old. They have been tons of fun every since. First they could only manipulate one block at a time, then they learned two, now they love to clap them together or knock down a stack. These blocks have been a great learning toy. Even better, they are visually appealing to me as an adult. I highly recommend them."
3,Not for babies,"Lots of blocks can still work for infants. I bought these for my 6 month old as she loves using her cousins. Unfortunately, the corners are too sharp on most of the blocks for her to play with. I ended up finding some softer ones. I kept these as I'm sure we can use them down the road- just wanted to warn other parents about the sharp edges for babies."
5,So much fun!,My two year old son LOVES these blocks! They are larger than other cubes (1 3/4 in. cubed) thus allowing my son to stack them higher and higher (I think he's up to 11 or 12 blocks now). He also likes to show me the animals and letters on the blocks - a great teaching tool! I wish I had these when I was a child!
4,Good Blocks,"These are really pretty blocks. The only reason why they didn't get five stars was because there were some splinters on the blocks. I inspected them before giving them to my child and noticed little pieces of the edges were coming off some of them, I just scraped them off and they are now good to go."
1,Not a fan,My son throws these blocks all over the house. I think it should have been made out of a softer material. It never even engaged him.
5,"Great nostalgiac block set, excellent quality and made in USA","My daughter loves these, and I think they're fantastic even if they are a little expensive (you really do get what you pay for most of the time). I'm glad to pay a bit more for a quality product made in the USA, and I don't have to worry about my kids getting lead poisoning or the problems associated with the soft wood most imported blocks are made from. These came quickly and were well packaged...BUY THEM!"
5,Grandson loves 'em!,I ordered these for my 14 month old grandson. He loves 'em! Nuff said! Ordering the lower case set today.
5,Still great the second time around!,"I bought a set of blocks like these that have the Braille dots on them for my granddaughter, who is visually impaired. She loves them and has a great time stacking them. Now, with a little brother in the house, there aren't enough to go around, so I bought another set and we make a game out of finding the blocks with the Braille dots on them hidden in the pile. They have survived all the playtime and fun and are sturdy, yet easy to hold and lightweight. You can't have too many!"
4,Good quality blocks,"I bought these blocks for my 10 month baby after reading many reviews of other blocks first. I was worried about the sharpness of the corners, size of the blocks, quality of the artwork on the blocks, and the paint. These blocks are sharp on the corners as other reviews say, but haven't been a problem. I am happy with the size of the blocks, I didn't know there were some sets that have sides less than one inch. These blocks are the larger 1.75"" sided blocks. The quality of the designs and the colors are very nice. The paint will come off if the baby chews on these or puts them in their mouth a lot. I would recommend this set"
5,Everything you want in blocks and more!,"It may sound odd, but my wife and I wanted to get high quality, made in America, educational blocks.These are just perfect. It has even surprised us how excited we've been over the blocks.Different animal on every block, the different colors, numbers, letters, type faces, math symbols.They put a lot of thought and creativity in these blocks.The fun and learning is limitless.I went ahead and bought one for our house and one for the in-laws.Worth every penny!"
3,corners are ver sharp,"I purchased this toy for my 9 month old son when he was 6 months old. They are still sitting in the bag, unused, because the corners of the blocks are VERY sharp and pointy. They could easily hurt a baby if the corner bumped his skin while he was playing, for instance, while tapping blocks together, crawling over one or falling on one. I would recommend giving this toy to a baby at least 18 months old."
4,A snapshot of teenage life!,"What a pity this book is out of print. Althoug it was published in 1988 and set in the 1970s, the story of a young middle-class woman's social ostracism because she is unexpectedly pregnant is timeless. Betsy Israel's story will resonate with many women who lost their babies to adoption in the 1960s and 1970s. In particular the account of her hospital treatment is most chilling. I was enthralled from the beginning when the author believes that a child she sees in a crowd is her own daughter - an experience which many women will recognise. This book contributes to the wealth of mothers' personal accounts about their adoption experiences and gives strength to their collective voice."
1,Very Basic,I would not suggest this DVD. I am a HUGE firm believer and never have been disappointed in one of their videos. This one is very slow and very beginner. The only part of my body that I actually felt like I got a work out was my arms and that was only because of the resistance I chose with the band. I have never done a Pilates workout for the first time and not felt it my core. Very disappointing.
4,interesting pilates approach,Nice to have a twist on the classical Pilates Mat work using the band. Keeps in line with other The Firm DVDs in terms of pace and presentation which makes this more of a workout than a Pilates routine. Not a difficult routine but a nice change.
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I just did this video and was dissappointed and bored. Unfortunately this is a very slow beginning and the camera work needs help, since ofter she starts a new move, but the camera is off somewhere else and totally misses it. I love pilates and the firm so I had great hopes for it, but sadly it did not live up to them. I would recommend Windsor Pilates over this one any day. There was no challenge in this at all and definitely boring."
4,Great Pilates-Based Workout,"This workout is great for when you want to have a mellow workout day.It's broken into 4 segments for a 50 minute total workout. Standing warm-up/core work, mat upper body, mat lower body and mat core/cool down. It definitely got my heart rate up and burned a suprising amout of calories (so says my heart rate monitor). There are beginner modifcations as well as more advanced moves. It encorporates a ""stretchy"" band for extra resistence and keeps it interesting. The 50 minutes always flies by I feel great after I've finished this workout."
4,Worth a Try,I like this dvd. The only problem is that it maybe too easy. I like easy workouts but this is too easy to even consider a workout. However it is effective it delivers as it promises.
5,PERFECT!,"It's so hard to me write a review when I just love an album and think it perfect. No problems or bad points to tell about, the only thing I can do is to tell how amazing it is.An extreme Metal with harsh vocals and fast guitars mixed with an extreme beautfull irish folk sonority.The album express so unequal felings as happiness and hate.Those who enjoy sofisticated and extreme music will love it."
5,Gift,This is a xmas gift so as yet do not know it they have crumbled in transit. If they have they will still be good!
4,Fascinating,"This book is a page-turner in some ways. I was particularly interested in the technology presented. I would definitely like more of a sequel in that universe -- particularly against the ongoing fight against the Erinye although that was simply part of the background. The characters themselves -- I particularly liked the Dame of Midgard although she was in the beginning very remote and inacessible, and Cariola the AI who betrays the Dame and the people of Midgard. The character of Tony Perrin was not as well developed. We do not quite understand why he likes the Dame of Midgard although without him -- the story wouldn't much progress! Moreover, I thought that the Rigorists were pretty much one dimensional. Simply there to introduce the civil war without any explanation why anyone would choose such a totalitarian/communist philosophy willingly. But in sum, it was a page-turner and I read it in one sitting. Much more enjoyable and interesting than much of the dreck that is on the market."
2,"Could have been great, but it wasn't","I was really disappointed by this book.The ideas were great, but it didn't deliver on the promises. The story wasn't compelling, and the consequences of the theme weren't explored well. I really didn't care about any of the characters. It's fine for the author to try to examine good and evil and in-between in different terms, but that does not excuse him from writing a story that is interesting.Some things were very good:1. Dealing with the difficulties of AI.2. The author doesn't bore us with too many useless details, but lets the reader imagine for himself much of the background.All in all I do not recommend the book."
2,Disappointed...,"I purchased this screen saver pack hoping that I'd be able to import the pictures into my current screen saver software, WebShots. However, Second Nature has created a similar screen saver program and the pictures are saved in a proprietary format. Therefore, you either use the screen saver program provided or say 'Bye bye' to your investment. Second Nature offers 1000s more pictures at a website, similar to WebShots. Unfortunately, I'm too vested in my current program to begin anew."
1,"A great musician, but a terrible DVD","I am a great fan of Jamal's music and I happened to come across a discounted copy of this DVD in a music store.I was so utterly disappointed.The quality of both,the audio and the video are extremely poor.Please do not waste your money buying this DVD."
5,Only oil I use in my hair!,"This oil works wonders for my natural hair. All of the ingredients are natural oils, that can be pronouced (big deal), and are recognizable. When I use this oil, I know that I am doing a great thing for my hair. It keeps it moisturizes longer and gives it a great texture. I tend to use it after wetting/dampening my hair. Or I will just rub it through my scalp and the ends of my hair. I will not be without this oil. Try it, you may love it too!"
4,Smells like baby oil,This oil has the thickness of mineral oil and the fragrance of baby oil. You will smell like baby oil (nice smell) during the day if you apply this oil after showering.
3,Gives very nice shine,Smells like baby oil which is a turn off for me because I would never apply baby oil to my hair.Left my hair really shiny but that's about it.Nothing spectacular probably will not repurchase.
2,Remember Jerry?,"Before I start the review, I have to agree that ""Estimated Prophet"" and ""Terrapin"" are great tracks, but I think people are forgetting something important: Jerry Garcia is the leader of the Grateful Dead. That will never change. I personaly find this album a little sad to listen to, with Jerry singing on only 1 track. I don't think anyone can say ""I'm happy that the band shifted creative control to a back-up singer."" with a straight face. If you want the best of the Dead, you need ""Europe '72"", ""Jerry Garcia (1972)"" and ""Mars Hotel""."
3,its ok but but earlier works like american beauty are better,i liked it but the earlier works are better i dont really like the albums with Donna and Keith Godchaux on them
2,"Terrapin Station Pt. I is a masterpeice, album is bad.","Without a doubt, Terrapin Station Part One is an absolute masterpeice, and, in my opinion, by far the best Dead song. Estimated Prophet is also good, but all of the other tracks on the CD really suck. Dancin' in the Streets has to be the absolute nadir of the Dead's musicianship. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this CD. Besides, nothing compares to Terrapin Station live."
2,Obvious talent but....Who is this?,"Objectively, this is not a bad CD. Estimated Prophet is a great tune for example. However, after that opening song, it's not the Dead experience (of course many would argue that the Dead experience is only live but I love their studio sound as well). Side 1 is completely missing Jerry Garcia's vocals which is to me one of the signatures of the band. The whole side sounds like Fleetwood Mac (a great band, nothing against them). And side 2 sounds like of all people, Jethro Tull...musically anyway (another great band, nothing against them either). Finally there are actual arrangements for massed strings! It does not surprise me that people like or even love this album, but if anyone thinks that this will be an extension of the four 5 star studio albums from Workingman's to Mars Hotel will be really surprised.....and possibly disappointed."
5,Terrapin station (the song) is a masterpiece,"If I had to pick one song that captured the spirit of the Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia, Terrapin Station would definitly be the one. It takes the listener into the heart of the Dead and shows you just what this band is made of. Terrapin contains some of the best lyrics, guitar, vocals, drums, and transitions ever created by the Grateful Dead. Terrapin Station is defiantly a must for any music lover."
4,"Good, but Terrapin performed live is GREAT.","I've always liked this from the day it came out, but I fell inextricably, irrevocably in love with it after I heard a knock-em-dead 30-minute performance. I had never thought that the somewhat over-produced album version could stand up in live arena performance but boy was I ever wrong. It soared, it plummeted, it digressed and returned, it despaired, it exalted. I died and was reborn several times in that 30 minutes."
5,A great introduction to the Dead,"A great start for new listeners and for fans it is an essential recording.This CD is worth the 15+ minute Terrapin Station title track alone, but the other songs are gems as well - especially Estimated Prophet, Passenger & Samson and Delilah.If there was another Dead album to get besides this one, I'd choose American Beauty or Workingman's Dead. They are much more 'folky' and have that traditional Dead sound. Both compliment each other, and either would be a very worthwhile purchase. Enjoy!"
5,Take That was ALL that,"Take That was without a doubt the BEST pop group in recent history, far superior to their successors (ie N*Sync, Backstreet Boys, Boyzone, etc). Every song on their greatest hits album is aimed not only at the legions of girls who were their adoring fans, but also at adults and others who may be reluctant to admit they like a ""boyband."" It's been three years since they announced their split, and listening to this album only serves to remind how sorely they are missed!"
2,Boy(band) was I disappointed...,"I guess I got completely swept up in my new love affair with Robbie Williams. I really was excited to order this retrospective of music of the band that help shape and mold the funk/pop/sex-god/in-yer-face Robbie Williams into the master of Escapology. Nothing on this CD remotely reminds me of Robbie. All I can say is thank God he was able to escape with his talent! Not only is the music here sappy (and, believe me, I expected that to a degree) but the recording is weak. I have to turn the levels up on my system so high that when I play any other CD the volume scares the hell out of me. Weak songs, weak voices, weak harmonies and a weak recording make for an investment I regret. I do enjoy owning, if not listening to, the peppy remakes of ""How Deep Is Your Love"" and ""Could It Be Magic"" so I guess it's worth the two stars."
1,This is the worst album of all times!,"This deffinetely takes the cake for being the worst album of all time. Only because five guys take their shirts off doesn't mean that they can sing or have any talent at all. They can't play instruments or sing but for some reason they are popular, I am utterly amazed at anyone who would buy this album. This just goes to show how uninformed people are about music!"
2,What floor?,"After listening to this album, I can understand now why Take That never broke into the American market. Not funky enough to dance to, not soulful enough to fall in love to, Take That represents the blandest of elevator music."
1,Total crap,"Take that are amongst the lousiest groups ever.they are even more worse than N'STYNC,OLD MEN AROUND THE BLOCK and southlife.this should be called as worst songs instead.A MUST AVOID.Get ECHOES BEST OF PINK FLOYD and FOGHAT LIVE from FOGHAT instead."
3,It's OK,Why does Robbie slag off Take That and the music...it wasn't that bad. Most of the songs are good because they were different at the time.
4,Great insight to the new technology,"I read this after a colleague bought it, I am nowing buying my own copy. It explains the new concepts with exceptual ease, if you want to understand the Active Diredtory and how DNS works, get this and be the smart guy on the block before the others jump on the band wagon."
5,Completely Satisfied,"My boyfriend and I purchased this item because we thought it would be a great project for both of us to work on. It has been great so far and has kept us busy. I like this item because it is very detailed and because of the 3-D effect, which is very different from the regular puzzles I have done in the past. My only wish is that we had more time to work on it."
2,poor shipping,"the box was beaten up pretty bad, might have happened in shipping, but maybe it should've been placed in another box then. Box is totally messed up and I was planning on giving to my niece for Christmas cuz she's been asking for it. Now i'm not sure if I should cuz it looks so crappy. Thought I had my Christmas shopping done now I'm not so sure. Thanks for messing that one up"
2,Under Delivered,The whole 3D thing is a cool idea. Especially when it comes in the correct box with instructions. This was not the case with my husbands gift. I was unimpressed with the packaging and the seller.
4,Overlooking his best track...,"While I wince everytime I hear 'Ghostbusters'...I truly believe that the song,'(I still can't get over)Loving you' is Ray's best work, the emotion in his voice is astounding...This is coming from a guy who's into genres that alot of you aren't familiar with, ie: Goth, Industrial & EBM.So if you ever see a freak walking down the street with a purple mohawk and torn jeans, listening to Ray Parker Jr./Raydio...say hello, I don't bite!"
3,He should have recorded more music,"Nice voice, nice looking, why didn't he record more music? Don't know very much about him, I think he's still living, will find out on Google."
3,"A Slight, but Competent Collection.","It's somewhat lamentable that a musician as gifted and long standing in the business as Ray Parker Jr. is still best remembered by a novelty hit and reduced to a silly catchphrase ('who you gon' call?')but any collection that includes ""You Can't Change That"", one of the most perfect pop songs ever recorded, can't be all that bad. While some of his later 80's work would become bland and almost non-descript, his late 70's and early 80's work with Raydio was top notch funk/rock/soul that still holds up today. ""The Other Woman"" is fine riff rock from the days when soul singers still played instruments. Since he's still around as a top studio guitarist his skills can still be appreciated, but this is adequate compilation does pretty good at covering his tenure as a major pop star."
3,"It's ain't just ""Ghostbusters""","Ray Parker Jr. is undoubtedly best known for the theme from ""Ghostbusters"", but he had a couple other songs, both as a solo artist and with Raydio, that were, if not stunning works of musical art, at least extremely catchy. Of course, you knew ""Ghostbusters"" was going to be on here (an excellent chord line spoiled by those horrible background vocals--""GHOSTBUSTERS!"" is not so much sung as it is chirped), but it's good to hear ""The Other Woman"" and ""Jack and Jill"" again. Parker's strength is writing a good groove--many of the songs are unbelievably hook-laden. His guitar work is decent as well. The lyrics, however, can border on embarrassing, and his voice, while undeniably sexy, doesn't go two notes in either direction. Still, a decent collection from Mr. Parker."
5,for those who remember his groove,"as writer,arranger,producer,instrumentalist,vocalist ray parker jr was very successful.these hits show case his funky sides on for those who like to groove and the other woman then before babyface a woman needs love.he is very versatile and this set shows the many talents of this man it seems just like yesterday with many of these songs."
2,Ray Parker jr. Isnt Raydio,"Ray Parker Jr like many other soul artists of the past, made pop records after going solo. If you want soul music played with instruments and not manufactured by synthesizers, try to find Raydio."
4,Beautifully reproduced art coupled with interesting prose.,"As one highly interested in the topic of angels and their fallen counterparts, I am always looking for a good book on the subject matter. Considering Carey's other work, I'm unsurprised to find her descriptions of this subject matter as lyrical and enjoyable as her more creative works.I'm also pleased by the high quality full color reproductions and interesting quotes throughout, which have given me plenty of sources and artists to study in other sources. Carey delves not only into the traditional representations of angels, but into the heretical tales as well, which leads to some of the more obscure legends surrounding these interesting creatures.This is a great reference for anyone interested in the subject matter, though I wish it were just a bit longer and even more in-depth. I would suggest Gustav's A Dictionary of Angels for a more in-depth source, though it does not have the lovely illustrations that this one has!"
4,1985 was THE Aretha Franklin year.,"""Another Night"" is one of Aretha's greatest recordings--a near-perfect marriage of Soul and post-disco dance beats with Aretha just tearing it up. The ballads ""Sweet Bitter Love"" and ""Until You Say You Love Me"" show why Aretha stll reigns. Sadly, the other tracks--while inspired--are overproduced and sound dated. Nonetheless, this was the album that catapulted Aretha back to the top of the charts and an important milestone in her already legendary career."
5,I DrIvE mYsElF cRaZy ThiNkInG oF *N SyNc,"HeY yA'll if ya wanna listen to a CrUnK song, it should be this one by *N sYnC. JuStIn, JoEy, ChRiS, LaNcE, & Jc do a great job harmonizing throughout the song. ANYTHING *N sYnC sings they are just amazing at! NoT 2 MeNtIoN, they are a bunch of HoTT! Lookin' Guys! ""I lie awake, I drive Myself Crazy thinking of them!"" Don't make a mistake, just buy the single! I love JuStIn, JoEy,ChRiS, LaNcE & Jc:) PeAcE & HaIr GrEaSe! ""StAy 'NsYnC:)!"""
5,*n sync are the kings of music!!,I think this cd is so great!! this song is very nice and i just love the way they sound. any music of *n sync is great!!! buy this cd because it's worth your money!! this cd deserves more than 5 stars!!! stay *n sync 4 ever and remember *n sync has got the flow.
3,These guys shouldn't of tried to make a second CD.,"We all loved the toons of N'sync's first CD, but their second one isn't worth all the hype- save your money."
1,Nothing you can't draw yourself,"First of all, I've seen all these pictures in the tattoo shops. It gave me NO new ideas and the artwork was nothing special. The designs weren't intricate or unusual or interesting. I'm disappointed."
4,Good Replacement Blade arms,I was searching for this specific size blade arm for 2 months in stores and finally I got the correct one online.
2,Frustrating book,"I am a great lover of British procedural novels. Their methodical, composed pace coupled with rich characters just work for me.Unfortunately, this is not a case with this deeply frustrating book. We heard just about everything about DS Kate Power's private loss, her lenghty house redecorating, her mean, sexist co-workers, her potential beaus, and so much more, more than we can possibly give a damn about.The core of this lame mystery,the crimes and the hard subject of paedophilia get a passing mention, somewhere between new curtains and visits to an old aunt. Ms. Cutler in this book appears to be a budding romance novelist. Well good luck to her, I'll be running in the opposite direction."
2,Good For The Technocrat !,"This book is too detailed for the average user as I have seen some of the instructionals from within this book that a friend purchased as a guide; it didn't seem to help. Most of the help he/she has gotten with XP has been verbal/written advice from me and a few other friends who are PC savvy. The book would be worth it somewhat, if the price were listed at 75% less than it is now!"
2,Good For The Technocrat !,"This book is too detailed for the average user as I have seen some of the instructionals from within this book that a friend purchased as a guide; it didn't seem to help. Most of the help he/she has gotten with XP has been verbal/written advice from me and a few other friends who are PC savvy. The book would be worth it somewhat, if the price were listed at ...less than it is now ...!"
3,Odd collection of random ideas,"Not badly written, but not particularly well thought out either. Contains some interesting ideas and some good info, but it often gives the appearance of info without any real substance. Worth a try if you need some different ideas and you've already gone through the better books on this topic."
3,Interesting but repetitive.,"The book is interesting but repetitive. I agree with another reviewer who said that it could be shorter. Moreover, I think that it looks too much at the past just at a moment when, with the changes Internet is bringing about, the situation is changing very quickly. I did not have the feeling that I was reading about The World Republic of Letters as it is now but as it was some years ago."
2,Redundancy,"Casanova's book probably reads better in the original French than in this lumbering translation. Nonetheless, in any language the book suffers from constant repetition of the same ideas. The book could easily have been one hundred pages shorter. Much of the discussion goes over old ground. The concluding chapter is not revelatory at all, but is worth pondering. Experienced readers might do well to skip directly to it."
1,How Many?,"I am interested in this item Maxell 636070 DVE-RAM recordable DVD Disc, but the desciption does not say how many. The pictures are not inlargeable either."
2,Jason what were you thinking,I Loved Jason in the Roswell series but this movie sucks sorry Jason you can do better
2,smaller than it looks online,"well i know it's a photo online, but I thought 24 ounces would be bigger. I think 24 ounces would fill it to the very top, and who does that with a dog bowl, so if you have a big dog, go with 48 or 64 ounces so you don't have to fill it up all the time and clean up spills"
4,Great Album...Just OK remaster from Lemon,This is a great album by the Sweet with some really good songs...it's got a couple of duds like Lady Of The Lake. This effort is one of their mellowest albums...but songs like the massive Love Is Like Oxygen make it worth picking up.I have the Lemon Records version and it is not remastered at all in fact the CD's output is very very low and it's hard to tell if they used master tapes for this release...they are notorious for vinyl transfers and this is probably the case for this reissue...still the quality is very listenable if you turn up the stereo a lot just not what you'd expect from a 2008 remaster. The other thing is I wish it came with the US cover art which I prefer.
2,Let's have some perspective here.....,"To call this the 'crown jewel' in the Sweet canon is like calling 'In Through The Out Door' Zeppelin's best...eccch. While classic Sweet albums take a page out of Deep Purple and Queen, this sounds more like a Bee Gee's album. It's pure fluff. Do yourself a favor and stop at 'Off The Record', even though you can begin to feel the slide on that record as well."
3,Mediocre at best...,"I must admit that my expectations weren't very high when I purchased this disc. I bought it for the extended version of ""Love Is Like Oxygen,"" a true pop-rock classic from the seventies. When I listened to ""Level Headed"" for the first time, I was quite surprised and rather disappointed that the first cut (""Dream On"") was a slow, sappy ballad. I might have embraced such a song had I been listening to Bread or The Carpenters, but this was SWEET! I expected cut one on an album by Sweet to be attention-grabbing, fun and up-tempo, but it didn't happen this time. Cuts three through ten are equally unremarkable.If not for the presence of cut two, ""Love Is Like Oxygen,"" I might have given this disc a one or two-star rating. The long version of ""Oxygen"" alone makes ""Level Headed"" worthy of a place in your music library."
2,Get the import,"Since the import is available--with the ""Love is Like Oxygen"" single edit (which is quite different) and also includes the non-LP b-side ""Cover Girl,"" it's a better item to own.It costs more than twice as much, though.I thought this American domestic re-issue would come with these tracks, and that's somewhat disappointing.Not one their stronger albums, either. It makes me think of something the Alan Parson Project would do in places."
3,running out of oxygen,"first of all foutain and love is like oxygen are awsome as well as california nights.but the rest is not nearly as good as the last five albums, and the remasteris terrible compared to fanny,wink,deso and off the record ( fantastic cd ).but a full version oxygen is great , just turn it up ."
5,Year of the Cat,Year of the CatHave always loved this album. Had the vinyl years ago. This is definitely a classic worth owning. Like almost every song

3,"Okay book. Covers basics, but not very inspirational.","This is an okay general cake decorating book. It covers all the basics and shows how to make some decorated cakes. I am actually not keeping it, as it is not very inspirational for me(the cakes are rather dated) and I have better instructional books for fondant and gum paste modeling. It has lots of pictures and good instructions, it is just not wowing me."
3,Good but a little disappointing....,"This book is beautiful and helpful, but I was disappointed there are no instructions for the small purple flowers on the cover (violets?). Still and all, a good book."
4,"User error, or chewy popcorn?","The movie style flavor is there, but the popped kernels are a bit chewy. It could be that I made it wrong by using a machine instead of the ""Whirely Pop"" thingy."
2,Disappointing,I was highly disappointed in the popcorn. I have the whirlypop maker and couldn't wait to get this popcorn to have the theatre popcorn taste.The first time the popping liquid was runny and the second time it was solid. Each time it didn't work as the directions said it would and when it does finally start to pop it burns.......... HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED - sorry I bought 3-5 packs
2,Not the best,"My popcorn-loving daughter gave this neutral to slightly negative reviews. Just not flavorful as advertised. Perhaps she's just too used to microwave popcorn flavors, so it may not be the popcorn. The right popper will make the difference."
5,Best Popcorn,The closest thing to movie popcorn. Every kernel pops and it has a great flavor. I recommend this popcorn to anyone who likes theater popcorn.
4,Tasty Popcorn,"This might cost a bit more than other ""store bought"" popcorn, but it is really worth it! It works so perfectly in my whirly pop maker! Great twosome!"
3,Not so theatre style,Not bad popcorn. Wasn't quite as good as I wanted. It did cook up extremely well but wasn't any where close to the flavor of movie theatre popcorn. Would not order again.
1,Strange coconut aroma,"I recently tried the five pack Wabash ""Real theater popcorn."" When cooking, there is a very off smelling aroma emanating from my popper.So? I tried Paragon popcorn oil in place of the Wabash product and had no more ""smelly"" issues. Neither product offers much in the way of actual product content. Hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated coco oil? The latter better than the former....both not so good, anyway.If you pop corn once in a while with Paragon + flavacol, you will not go wrong. I wouldn't consume this combo very often, like maybe once or twice a month?.......by the same token, just like eating fat laden prime rib, potato chips, hotdogs, all the good stuff, is bad for your cholesterol lol.Sadly all the snacks and fast foods we enjoy.....sucks.C'est la vie."
2,"The reason I chose the two stars was the lengthy Edwardian wording,& phrases .",I liked the over covering theme of love between the sisters.It seemed unclear as to what really happened to Marion in the end.I would recommend it to someone who loves Edwardian classic literature

5,Cheap entertainment,"My kittens think this is the greatest thing since canned cat food. They will play with it until they fall asleep under it exhausted; and it's so much fun to watch. When I figure out how to work my camera, maybe I'll do a video. I think it would be a big hit on you tube."
2,My cat loved it,My cat loved it but unfortunately it completely fell apart after just a few days. I've ordered him more but they all only last a few days. He LOOOOVES them though so it's a good thing they're inexpensive.
4,Awesome entertainment,"I love watching my three cats play with this toy. They will be entertained for hours. However, my one cat thinks that he can walk off with the bird and typically snaps the string. I have to repair it often, but still fun."
5,Cat's FAVORITE toy,"This toy is my cats all-time favorite toy. She will play until she can no longer keep her eyes open, where upon she falls asleep beneath it. Wal-mart stopped selling it so I'm very excited to have found it on the web.:)"
1,"so glad it's ""rare""","This is a scent I think Yankee Candle could have gone with out making. I received a votive of this scent in a 24 pack and this first thing I did, after smelling it of course, was to throw it away!!! I couldn't get it in the trash fast enough. The smell seemed to linger in my nose and took forever to get it out. I could have puked it was just that nasty. I'm sorry, but this is one of two candles by YC that I will NEVER buy again."
2,Falls apart within days,"If you have a larger cat that has front claws, you'll want to stay away from this product. Now, my cat is atypically large (over 16 lbs. at 10 months, not even a little overweight) and has his front claws, although they are well trimmed. He completely destroyed the toy on the end of the pole within 2 or 3 uses. There were fuzzy orange fibers all over the place. Quite a mess."
1,Too hot to handle,Red Chile (not green) are in the sauce and the amount exceeds other spices by a wide margin - can not even taste the other namesake ingredients such as garlic and basil due to quantity of red chile - would not recommend.
4,Should not have to search all over the internet for the ingredients.,"After a 20 minute web search, here are the ingredients (Thai Pavilion Garlic Basil Stir Fry Rice Noodles With Sauce, 7.05-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)):Stir-Fry Rice Noodle Ingredients: Rice Flour, Water, Salt. Sauce Ingredients: Fresh Garlic, Fresh Green Chilies, Soy Oil, Oyster Sauce (Water, Cane Sugar, Salt, Oyster Extract, Cornstarch)Fish Sauce (Anchovies, Salt, Water, Cane Sugar, Vinegar)Cane Sugar, Fresh Thai Basil, Soy Sauce (Water, Soybeans, Salt, Cane Sugar, Vinegar)Salt."
4,Great!,"I tried this with beef and added broccoli and added extra noodles. I'm glad I added extra noodles because w/o it, it would've been tooo spicy for me..and I like it spicy! Definitely would reccomend if you can handle the spiciness!"
4,The Essential NIN,"I liked this CD but the US version with 9 songs (including Trent's apparent interpretation of his high-school band days, ""March of the F**kheads"") is much better. Trent still remains true to the original song ""Closer"" in these remixes, but there are wild screaming surprises and murky undertones. Great gift for someone you're trying to convince that NIN is (was, always shall be) the best industrial noise ever......"
4,One of NIN's best,"I've got to hand it to Trent, though - he is definately one of the masters of the remix. The only bad thing is the best mix of ""Closer"" - ""Closer to God"" isn't included on this CD. However, the best mixes of Closer are deviation and precursor. I found the ""further away"" mix to be a little irritating. Overall, a good selection of remixes. I'd give it 4.5 stars. Love that cover, too."
4,Great single,"This is a great single. The remixes are very good, and aren't just rearranged parts of the original song. The best remix is Further Away; its just as good as the original. Most of the remixes are pretty long, about six minutes each, and on Closer, there are an extra 10 seconds that aren't included on the Downward Spiral. Although this CD is expensive for five songs, its worth it."
3,This is a good collection of hits.,"This second volume of greatest hits from Alan Parsons Project is pretty good. Even though this band has never been a favorite of mine, I still respect and listen to them every once in a while. This group is a combination of pop and progressive music. My favoite songs are ""Don't Answer Me,"" ""Stereotomy,"" and Turn of a Friendly Card."" ""Don't Answer Me"" is one of my favorite Alan Parsons Project songs that is just great. This is worth a listen and I actually rate it 3.5 stars."
5,Really enhances the wine,"We bought these glasses on a recommendation from a relative. Have given comparative tastes to friends twice, and in both cases, were told that there is a noticeable difference in the taste of the wine when in the Riedel glass."
5,Info,Just to let everyone know this dvd is and other Yu Yu Hakusho dvds are rated TVPG if that helps any one. Great dvds! You shoud pick it up!!!
5,miles and bill,"Ottimo album!Quando ho sentito la prima volta un pezzo di questo cd pensavo fosse dell'album Doo-Bop di Miles Davis. Che abbiano suonato insieme per diverso tempo si sente.Non confondetelo con il pianista omonimo: ma anche se lo faceste non guasterebbe, è spettacolare anche lui e prendere un cd del pianista per sbaglio sicuramente non è un errore..."
5,Great Album,I was unsure bout orderin bt had to have this album. Shipped on time and everything is Great!
5,Sweet voice of Christy Lane sings inspiring songs,I listen to this everyday. I love her sweet sincere delivery and her choice of songs is great I have just ordered a second copy to give as a gift.
5,Blessings,"This CD exceeded my expectations and lifted my spiritual awakeing to a new level of listening enjoyment , God Bless"
3,Not item advertised,"I ordered this product from am email I got about a launch of Christy Lane entitled Songs of Passions and listed song titles that I was intereted in, BUT not only did I not get the CDs that were advertised, upon further searching I could find some links to ""Songs of Passion"" by Christy Lane but it in no way has the songs that were listed in my pre-order email. Now I like Christy Lane but I have 2 CDs (1 for me and 1 for a friend) that I wouldn't have purchased ordinarily and have to decide if it's worth the trouble returning these items for my refund. This is the FIRST time I've ever had a problem with an order from Amazon - normally everything is just fine and hassle free."
1,Pathetic Examples and multiple mistakes make this a loser!,"What I'd hoped would be an excellent book to introduce me to COM and DCOM has turned out to be an exercise in futility.I've been used to the quality tutorials from WROX press and Microsoft Press where they lead you step by step through an exercise. The author's first example in Chapter 2 I did not even realize was an example until they expected me to run it in chapter 3! There were no instructions on how to create the COM client, just several lines of code. This set the tone of the book.When I tried to run the author's code examples they failed.There were also multitudinous spelling errors and discrepencies between the Figures and the instructions.Though the authors clearly know their subject, I will have to find another book if I wish to learn COM and DCOM. This book is basically worthless as far as the examples go."
2,not recommanded,the title is misleading! there isn't much DCOM in the book. it is also very expensive.
2,"Basic, confused but an ok Step-by-Step","It has some interesting basic examples that are helpful to figuring out how to use ATL Wizards and playing with some basic COM development. DCOM is almost non existant in the book however. They spend far too much time developing the basics to have any advanced concepts.Lastly, the examples are fraught with errors and incompatability issues. The publisher should really produce an erratta."
3,This is a good basic introduction to COM,This book provides a nice basic introduction into COM for C++ programmers. The examples are simple and easy to understand. I would have given it a better rating except for the number of errors in the text.
4,"Decent book, not very detailed about DCOM","While I enjoyed reading the book and did get alot of useful information out of it, it doesn't really delve into the DCOM aspect of COM. If you're wanting to learn COM, this book is great, if you want DCOM, recommend Inside DCOM."
4,A delightful read for kids and parents,"My four year old and my six year old (who reads very well) both find all of the Alistair books delightful. The colorful illustrations, the matter of fact expressions, and the quirky endings make them delightful to read and hear again and again -- which is what always happens at our house."
1,WEAK ARGUEMENTS,"After reading this and comparing it to scripture and what has been written, it came down to simply weak excuses. The true LDS person knows the doctrines and the problems with it. This book didn't offer much of an arguement, more of a straw mans argument. I have found this from most books that just simply quote what the Prophets and Church leaders have said. I wouldn't try to use this book in my arguements, there are others which are better."
1,Thoughts.,"Interesting read, though I would have expected better scholarship. Based on the overwhelming amount of dissenting material, is ""mormon apologist"" a contradiction of terms?Challenge - look up Thomas Stuart Ferguson to see how he described LDS at the end of career."
4,truth seekers,"I thought this book was great! I myself was once a member of another church & soon after joining the LDS Church I read ""One minute answers"" PRAYERFULY, along with ancient & modern scripture; it immediately solved many of my concerns that previously had been brought up by antimormon literature. Most people that beleive the deceptions of professional antimormons, are truth seekers who've been led astray by ""wolves in sheeps clothing"". By the way, the definition of a cult is: 1)a system of religious worship 2)a devoted attachment to, or extravagent admiration for a person [JESUS CHRIST], principle, ect....) {Webster's new world dictionary,2nd college ed.,1984, pg.344,[] added}"
3,"great content, poor organization","This book offers a fine introduction to the study of vocabulary through the root approach that emphasizes building word ""trees"" out of the ""trunks"" of Latin and Greek roots, suffixes and prefixes. I am using it in a high school summer school vocabulary class and I find it effective, but unevenly organized. There are some effective graphic devices that need to be carried through consistently, but are not. For individual study, the book is useful because it includes exercises, with an answer key in the back. It's small size is a bit annoying, but the price is right."
4,"Omnibus collection of some hard to find stories, but...","This is an omnibus editon of George MacDonald's three Vicar Walton stories, the second and third of which are fairly difficult to find. Excellent reads, very enjoyable. The only drawback is this particular edition is edited into modern English, so the original flavor of MacDonald's writing is lost. While that has its advantages, especially in readability, still this aren't the books that MacDonald wrote and that C. S. Lewis named as some of his favorites. If you are a casual reader that just wants some of the finest English fiction from the late Victorian period, I highly recommend this edition. If you're a fan of MacDonald, though, you might want to keep looking for the unaltered originals."
4,Great product!,"This is a great product, but I still like one of their other models better, however the screw for it went bad and I can no longer install a new blade! So sad!!!!!This one will be fine to use. At least I can, for now, install new blades. If it goes bad, then I'll no longer purchase this brand of rotary cutters."
4,Ergonomic with a clean cutting line,"This is my first purchase of a rotary cutter as I've started taking screen printing classes, and I found this very easy to use for a great price. I've been mainly using it to cut fabric and while it's a little tricky to get a perfectly straight line, it slices through on the first try almost every time for lighter-weight fabrics and wrapping paper, and it's very easy to make minute corrections when the line is a little off."
2,Lefties Beware,"I would have loved this product if I were right handed. Maybe once I get the hang of it, it will work better with my left hand. But currently when I use my lefthand I can't see what I'm cutting very well, so it works better in my right. I'm not coordinated enough to trust myself on tricky projects with my right hand, so time will tell if this was a waste of my money or not."
2,Not a great rotary cutter,"This is cheaply made and has the problem of not staying together well. The plastic nut that holds the blade on keeps falling off. Cuts well, but I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Very handy,I bought this cutter with the perforating blade to make fundraising tickets. Worked out great without having to take the paper cutter along with me.
5,Easy on the wrist,This was recommended by some longtime quilter friends. I am a novice quilter and wanted some good basic starter tools.
1,Worked great...until it didn't,I used this rotary cutter all of 3 times and then the blade suddenly went dull on me. I was surprised at how little I had used it and it was already time to change the blade? I decided to go with another brand because I asked some other people if it was normal. One of my friends had never changed a blade and has been sewing for several years. I learned my lesson from buying something so cheap and then getting poor results.
4,create a dotted line for easy tearing of paper or cardboard,I use the rotary cutter to create a tear-along-the-dotted-line cut on paper. The cutters cuts through heavy paper easily. Push the knife away from you along a metal ruler for the straightest lines.
3,Rotary Cutter,I really like this style of rotary cutter but this particular one will not close properly without loosening the blade.
1,Fiskars Rotarty Cutter,"I bought this for my wife received it very fast just one problem the blade was so dull it wouldn't cut hot butter. Had to go to Wal-Mart and pay $5.99 for a new blade which is not good since the cutter was $ 7.00 so one star it is. Would have been better off just buying one from Wal-Mart she's looking for other sewing accessories but not from Fiskars.Update, they were were supposed to send my wife a new blade for this cutter on Nov.20th still haven't seen it, can't take that long to ship a blade so goodbye to Fiskars she'll get her sewing supplies else where. Wasted money for a useless product and people wonder why this country is goung down the crapper. So if i could i'd give this seller no stars stay away from them if the customer sevice is this bad."
2,great for you if you like a cheap product,well the reason i ordered online was because in the store they were 36 dollars and i paid just 11 dollars for these and as soon as i tried them took me awhile to figure how hard i need to press for them to cut maybe they cut paper well but i need them to cut fabric better maybe i should get new different brand cutter but they still are very sharp so i guess i will just have to use what i have now the constuction seems weak hope they do not break on me while i am using them i wish they were made of harder plastic and metal but i guess you get what you pay for next time i will spend more money for a better product holding them leaves a sour taste in my mouth they just feel cheap here is to hoping they hold out after my project i have a lot of fabric to cut
3,OK,Bought this product to help with trimming in a garden. I was looking for something that would make it easier than scissors. This wasn't it. I think I will try electric scissors.
5,"I never thought I would buy one of these, but....","I did.I'm a young adult, avid slingshot and archery enthusiast, and a logical nerd.Having a rotary cutting tool to cut my natural latex bands for my upcoming slingshot and slingbow was crucial.Fiskars answered. I am happy.Need I say more? Hm....probably not.Enjoy!"
3,Rotary cutter works okay.,This rotary cutter works less well than expected. The blade is sharp enough but the mechanism doesn't stay in place that well. The button on top sometimes releases without being pressed. Could have been just a fluke since fiskars products are usually reliable.
2,"Kind of flimsy, eh","I like the form factor, I like how eazy the blade comes is unprotected, protected. But I'm not sure it really does that great of a job, I bought it for the wife to cut down boxes (we buy way too much through Amazon),and she really doesn't like it.It is probably a great hobby blade, scrapbooking etc, but for heavier around the house tasks, eh.."
2,Won't Cut through hot butter,"I am very unhappy with this product, I finally got the material and started to cut the squares for a quilt and the advertisement and packaging stated it can cut through ""multiple layers of fabric, paper, felt and vinyl"". Well I tried 3 pieces of thin cotton and it would not cut period, checked blade it is in correct, went to one layer and still have to run blade over the cut several times and it still would not cut through the material, had to finish some cuts with scissors. Not impressed with this expensive piece of junk"
4,Very nice,"This cutter is about what I expected, which is no insult. It has a nice handle, a VERY sharp blade, an easy-to-use safety latch to retract the blade and a decent price for the whole package. Less than what it would have cost at my local craft store even with a coupon. Don't even pretend you can use it without a cutting mat, because you can't. It would decimate anything not meant to stand up to it. I haven't tried to cut more than 2 layers of substantial fabric yet, but it has performed reasonably so far. Sometimes it's necessary to go back over an edge to clean it up a bit, which is why I subtracted 1 star. But it's a glorified pizza cutter, not magic, so no surprise there."
3,"Good, but tricky to use","A good, cheap rotary cutter, has a very sharp edge and the blades are cheap to replace, but i have a few problems with it.1.The blade comes loose a lot and you need to re tighten it with a little nob on the back.2.If you push down hard enough on the blade, it retracts.3.It feels cheap, entirely plastic and the mechanism that pushes and retracts the blade feels like i could break at any time."
4,Great Buy,"I purchased this product after my sewing instuctor talked about rotary cutters in our class. It seemed to take me forever to cut out a pattern so I decided to purchase one. I'm so glad I did. It's so much easier and faster than working with ordinary scissors. Since I'm new to sewing I don't have any experience working with other rotary cutters. However, I have not had any issues or problems with these and the price was affordable. They were less that the scissors I purchased. I would recommend this product."
5,Quick cutting,"I use these to cut tulle fabric and when I'm cutting I usually have the fabric folded over about four times and for the most part it will cut through completely about 98% of the time. Sometimes it doesn't always cut the very first section but that might be operator error. My only concern is I feel the blade may dull quickly, but that it's an easy fix as the blade can come off very easily"
2,Not good,I bought this cutter because of the reviews it got here on Amazon. Unfortunately I cannot say I like it much at all and I'm hoping Santa brings me a new one this year. It barely cuts through 1 layer cleanly and if you put even the slightest pressure on it the blade pops back up under the safety guard. Really not a great pair of these- maybe if you're a beginner go for it but its been nothing but frustrating for me.
2,Doesn't work for paper projects,"I bought this to cut paper and lightweight cardstock. The blade isn't sharp enough to cut either of those. The construction of the product itself is good but the blade is dull and useless. Maybe I got a refurbished item and they didn't tell me or something? Not sure. Disappointed, though."
2,"Not impressed, blades completely dull after making a few 9"" quilting blocks","Don't know if Olfa's are any better, but I can tell you that unless you buy a blade sharpener, plan on spending boo-coo bucks on blades just to finish your quilt. And don't drop your rotary cutter on a hard floor, the blades will be totally messed up after that. I'm sure that's true with any rotary cutter, so be careful."
1,Cheap and Dull!,"Bought this a while ago based on all the praising reviews. It cuts single sheets of paper like butter, BUT that's the only thing it ever cut. The blade is sooooo dull that by the time I'm done cutting a 2 layers of cotton fabric (really thin) my hand is killing me from pressing the blade down. Ordered new blades, same thing!!! The button for blade retraction is a pain in the ""neck"" because when I press down on the blade very hard I usually touch it by accident and the [dull] blade retracts. Very annoying and not worth the money. I will be looking for another manufacturer to purchase this product from."
2,Rotary Cutter,"I am not happy with this product. It does not seem sharp enough. When I cut with it, it hardly cuts through one piece of fabric and not very good at that. Some pieces cut and some do not. I bought this because some of my friends had this type of cutter and it worked great. I had to end up using my sicssors."
5,Basic rotary cutter works for left or right hand.,"This is my favorite go-to cutter - I have been using one for over 15 years. It has a comfortable handle, easy open close latch and uncomplicated blade change."
3,Spring loaded safety device is in the way when cutting,"I don't find it any better than my other Fiskars rotary cutter, even with an 'ergonomic' design. The problem is the safety spring is right where my fingers rest , and even gentle pressure will cause the blade to retract during cutting operations! This is scary and frustrating. It's an unnecessary technical device that does not enhance product usefulness."
5,5 stars doesn't really do justice to this group of musicians,"As before, when I commented on the Swing Shift Band, I would love to know the names of the sidemen who contribute so very much to the quality of all the Pennington/Emmons recordings. If anyone knows who they are, please send info to fisherjj@micron.net and thanks!"
1,This Product is a Total Bust...,"Had no problem for the first 2 months, since that time, after the slow twist instructions, I have been able to lite it ZERO times...Tried for the last time, for two hours yesterday...Changed tanks & everything else I could of...Hope to find another hose that will work...What good is a great little grill if it will not light.???....Dave Hoover"
1,Not for Me,"I keep my grill on the covered patio. I love the grill, but threw out the cover because I never felt the need to put it on the grill...you've gotta wait until the grill is cool, then you lose interest in the cover."
4,"fits the weber grill, a must have","if you get a weber gas grill (which is a great small grill), get this matching cover to protect it."
3,Best of Michael Ball,"Not exactly what I would call the best of Michael Ball, but overall the album was satisfactory."
3,Impressive!,"A friend of mine bought this cd recently and wanted me to listen to it. I was skeptical at first because it isn't my style, but I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed it."
4,Sometimes first is best,"Okay, so only three of these 10 tracks are really big hits, but what a three! Let Me Be the One, Seasons Change and Point of No Return are more than any group should be allowed to put on a first album. Besides, the other seven are far from bad.Expose' set the stage for the explosion of the Miami sound, probably best personified by Miami Sound Machine and then Gloria Estefan's solo work. Listen to this album, and you'll know where those contagious rhythm's and driving beats came from.The only downside to this disc is that Expose' never equalled it, not even with their so-called ""Greatest Hits"" collection. No matter. If you want to kick start a party, pick a track from Exposure and let the fun begin!"
3,cal pozo has lost his magic touch.,you will know the difference if you compare cal pozo's newly released dvd instruction with his older vhs dance instructions series. his older videos were more detailed and organized compared with his year 2000 series. i prefer his older style of teaching during his vhs hey days. if you can get a dvd copy of his older dance instructions then i would recommend that. the only newer 2000 series that i like is his combo salsa and samba dvd instruction. this new 101 latin dance dvd is dismal compared with his older and original latin dance lessons. that is just my opinion.
1,old dvd,i didnt like this dvd. and i ordered a couple of his dvds and didnt like either one because they are all like for old people. its not even appealing to watch.
3,Silver Convention,"I had expected that the songs in this CD to be the original versions on from the various albums. However, they were the extended dance versions. Fine for a dance, less so for listening as many lyrics were chopped out in favour of melody. Still ok though."
3,"Self-Indulgent, but Not without Charm","The author has many of the defects of your average American kid: Self-absorbed, superficial, etc.The book is, however, a graphic coming-of-age story of an immigrant child and has its charm. Not great, but worth reading if that's what you're after."
1,slow delivery,"I ordered this book and the english book at the same time. I received the english book on Saturday of the same week, but it took two additional weeks for me receive this book. Since I had homework to do for the class, I ordered and from someone else. The book has been sent back. I am now waiting on a refund."
3,"""I Robot""-like","""Limelight"" and the instrumental ""Urbania"" are the two tracks that carry this album for those who listen to APP for the same kind of sounds in ""Tales and Mystery..."" and ""Turn of a Friendly Card."" For those who were introduced to APP by ""I Robot"" this will probably be one of their favorites, a more rock driven album.I must admit that I've never really been able to figure out the central theme of this album, but there are some very interesting sounds on it. Still this isn't what I would refer a friend to if I were to introduce them to what I enjoy about APP."
2,Stereoility,"This may have been worth something upon release, but the eighties synth-power-pop production aesthetic which had firmly taken root renders these competent, though rarely compelling, dusty tech-fests irrelevant today."
2,dull,"Not the best Alan Parsons Project album. Dull, repetitive, particularly the title track and the reprise. Stick to the earlier work."
4,Alan Parsons Project - One Of Their Hardest Rocking Discs,"""Stereotomy"" is another good APP disc. This one is probably one of the band's hardest rocking. APP is never really heavy, but there are some really good rockers on this one including the title track, ""In The Real World"", ""Beaujolais"", and ""Stereotomy Two"". The ballads are all strong as well. ""Limelight"" is outstanding and ""Light Of The World"" is also a nice one. The only weak point on this disc is the instrumentals. They are ok, but are not on a par with some of APPs better ones. It is also notable that Eric Wolfson only sings a portion of one song on the whole disc which seems unusual. Overall this is not the best APP album, but I have always enjoyed it."
5,Stereotomy,"Stereotomy, great song, great group. Also listen to Limelight, great song, sung my Gary Booker (former lead singer of Procum Harem."
5,APP IN THE LIMELIGHT,"STEREOTOMY is sort of the black sheep of the APP family. It's a little harder-edged than previous efforts and not as ""thematic"" in concept. Yet I thoroughly enjoy this album and appreciate the venture into non-familiar territory.Vocals from John Miles, Gary Brooker, Chris Rainbow and Graham Dye are effective and there's a nice cameo vocal from Eric Woolson. Guitarist Ian Bairnston supplies incredible lead work and the arrangements impeccably Parsons.While the themes of loss and depression are prevalent, the songs themselves are mostly up-tempo and bright and the ballads are typical Parsonesque.The title track is one of my favorites, its staccato delivery and enigmatic lyrics hypnotic. BEAUJOLAIS is bouncy and infectious. LIMELIGHT is lovely despite its mournful pathos. URBANIA and WHERE's THE WALRUS are polished instrumentals, a little more intricate than earlier offerings.All in all, I think STEREOTOMY is a fine album, a strong representation of APP's musical genius."
5,Exceptional Natural Skin Cream,"Zia's Natural Skincare Ultimate C Serum is exceptional for sensitive skin. With an extremely light scent, it is also perfect for those of us who dislike heavily perfumed products. Wear this under a light, natural moisturizer and a bit of squalane oil for beautiul skin. Just remember to also eat healthy foods and drink lots of fresh water each day!"
2,"Love Iza, but this one's not a favorite","My 2 y/o son and I love the other Iza books we have- Twinkle Twinkle, Itsy Bitsy Spider, and I'm a Little Teapot. They are some of our all time favorites! This one, though, is one that I dread reading every time my son brings it to me. He does like it, but I'm not crazy about the story or the rhyming. The animals are greedy and mean, and I don't like the idea of teaching that presents make people like you better. I get the moral of the story (giving rather than receiving) but I don't think that would come across to a small child. The rhymes seemed forced, unlike the other Iza books, and the whiny animals are just annoying. I can't say enough nice things about the other books she has written, but this one just doesn't measure up."
5,Baa Baa Black Sheep...,Great Book. Love the way this was written. Great addition to the little one's book collection. She loves her books.
2,Wouldn't recommend,"I'm a preschool teacher, and i read so many book everyday, thought i'd give this a go at 99 cents. It wasn't bad, but personally i like her other books better... I HIGHLY recommend I'm a little teapot & the itsy bitsy spider by iza, the kids LOVE those"
5,The impressive result of an eight year project,"Angels & Monsters: A Child's Eye View Of Cancer by art therapist Lisa Murray and professional photographer Billy Howard is the impressive result of an eight year project in which Murray worked with children and had them express their feelings about their cancers through their artwork -- and then talk about their art. Howard took a photographic portrait of each child. The artwork and the portraits where paired and presented in a stunningly beautiful and thought-provoking exhibit under the auspices of the American Cancer Society, and which is memorably presented in the pages of Angels & Monsters. Sensitive, insightful, unique, and thoroughly ""kid friendly"", Angels & Monsters is highly recommended reading for any child (and their parents) having to cope with cancer, and would make a welcome and valued addition to any school or community library collection."
2,"It has its moments, but overall disjoint and unfocused","Robert Sheckley has written some great, absurd satire, so I'm interested when he comes up with something new. I enjoyed the early chapters of this book, but as it went along, it simply lost focus, randomly introducing and abandoning characters and situations. It was clever in many ways, but the disintegrating structure lost me.Sheckley wrote many short stories in the 1950's and 60's, and some say those were his best work. It has probably always been a challenge for him to hold a long story together. But some of his novels have been great -- my favorites are ""Mindswap"" and ""Journey of Joenes"". Most of his work is out of print, but it's worth looking for if you've got a taste for the absurd."
4,A great deadly game,I read the book The Deadliest Game from the series Net Force. It was a book about two kids who fight online crime. And in this book they get a very dangerous case. In this case they try to catch a guy who has taken an online virtual reality game to serious. This guy is ruining other contestant's computers and even hurting others. I liked this book very much I thought it did a great job in conveying the futuristic virtual reality Internet. Also it did a great job in creating a great suspense mystery. This story takes many interesting turns. If you were interested in reading a future set mystery I would definitely recommend this book. I think in this book having teenagers be the detectives are a symbol. A symbol for teenagers and kids becoming more smart then the adults. So if you want a book to read check out The Deadliest Game by Tom Clancy
4,Real view of VR future,"This books shows you, how the world is changing and what could be the result of those changes. You can look into sometimes scary world of games and VR.Great book, I really enjoyed it."
1,Not up to usual Tom Clancy,"This story line is so far off Clancy it was a chore to read. If your going to write about the future, don't do it on a script set 1000 years ago."
2,dont read it,"Tom Clancy's Net Force is a very boring book. Tom Clancy can do way better. He has written way better books than this. I suggest you don't buy this one. This book is about a virtual game called the dominion of Sarxos. People play this virtual game a lot and it is the biggest virtual game in the world. But people have been taking the game too seriously and are trashing people's apartments, and ruining their computers and hurting them. They hire a girl to figure out who's been doing this and some interesting things happen but I won't tell you. This book is okay but don't buy it. Just check it out from a library because it's not worth buying."
5,Corelle Impressions Textured Leaves,I love this set of Corelle. The pattern is great and the colors are very muted. Light and easy to use. The matching items are nice and easy to find. I have had Corelle sets for 20 + years but this is by far the best.
5,Informative and easy to follow,"I like this book because it is informative and easy to follow. It is one of the few books written in English on the subject of Chen Taijiquan. I think that it will help anyone that is looking to further their understanding of the original style of ""Tai Chi"", and give it 5 stars."
1,This guy teaches???? He is stealing your money,"This guy is a Quack.Trying to take your money.Just look at the cover, his posture.He does not follow an important rule in martial arts practice.Look at one of his knees.One of them is in front of his toe.That's an error.A Kung Fu man has to be aware, know that the knees don't getin front of, past the toes.Remember this rule, if a ""sifu"" makes this error, run away from that school."
3,good book,"this is a good electrical book, it is more about teory than practical instalations, it got some mistakes. also easy explanations."
2,Not very good,"I wanted to like this, but I could still smell myself through the lavender. If you're the type of girl that likes Toms etc this may be for you, but if you have moderate to heavy smell-age it's probably not worth it."
2,Did not work.,"This had some good natural ingredients but unfortunately it did not work for me. It has a gel consistency and goes on smooth, I did not experience burning or stinging. I mostly do computer work, a few times a day I walk the dog or go to the mail box so I don't do things that make me sweat. But this did not work for me, even with that little activity I smelled. I will not buy this again. I'm going to continue to use it until I run out but will have to put it on a couple of times a day in order to contain odors."
4,Great selection!!,"being for many years a subscriber of JAZZIZ, this selections is one of my favorites, Etta James and Flora Purim are an example of 2 different styles that blend successfully in this CD. Here are the tracks:Marcus Miller ""The Blues""Tales (PRA Records)Roy Hargrove ""Roy Alan""Family (Verve)Flora Purim ""Rhythm Runner""Speed of Light (B&W; Music)Ryo Kawasaki ""Night and Day""Love Within the Universe (One Voice/Satellites)Cornell Dupree ""Bop 'N' Blues""Bop 'N' Blues (Kokopelli)Kurt Elling ""Say Goodbye""Close Your Eyes (Blue Note)Herbie Hancock ""Dis Is Da Drum""Dis Is Da Drum (Mercury)Etta James ""Don't Go to Strangers""Time After Time (Private Music)Marilyn Scott ""Take Me with You""Take Me with You (Warner Bros.)Jon Hendricks and the All Stars ""Everybody's Boppin'""Enjoy it!!!Luis"
5,This is the greatest CD!!!,"I became a friend of Jonathon Sprout after he sang at my school. I have a lot of his CDs and tapes, and I think this one and More American Heros are his best. These CDs tell about heros who have done great things. I like learning the facts about the characters he sings about. If there were 10 stars, I'd give it that many. I listen to it over and over, and always love it."
5,"Catchy music, lots of learning, great fun = FANTASTIC tape","My kids love it, I enjoy it. Fun songs that teach you about great people in American history - chugging along Harriet Tubman's underground railroad, light bulbs flashing in the head of Edison. A good mix of women and men. One of the best tapes my kids (18 mo - 9 years) have. I have often given it as presents and get the same feedback."
1,Aw.......come on Troma!!,"It may sound intresting but unfortunetlly thats all.This movie is very boring all the way to the end.The story is about some Nazis that think they rule a beatch, and they kills every one who dare to epose them. But when they killed a man called Leroy, they realy got an big problem.Leroys mother is about to take revenge on them. The fx's are so bad that you wount beleave it and the story are not to good. I cant recomand this montion picture, but if you have to se it, then se it."
1,don't waste your time,"hardly any surfing footage. I didn't find it amusing either, poor production, plot, etc."
1,worst movie ever!,I don't even lie when I say this is the worest movie I have ever seen! The only cool part is when the nazi chick gets her head runover buy the boat motor. This movie is so bad it makes Nync look good :(.
1,This [...] is the Gayest Movie i Have ever Seen!,"Wow i feal much stupider after seeing Surf Nazis Must die. This was totaly Libarachi Gay! If The director was to create another film in his downhill career, we would be contemplating suicide meer moments after its realse. Please spare us the bulletts and blood and dont see this film."
5,Surf Nazis Must Die,"Great movie,classic Troma movie. Entertainment at it's most raw. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes + killer Clowns from Outer Space. LOL-ROFL"
3,[Funny],"Who cares if it's a bad B flick? The fun is watching Leroy's Mama trash the Surf Nazis one by one until she stands alone in triumph! The scene where Adolph is making love to his girlfriend on the beach has a classic line: ""Adolph...I told you...NOT HERE!"""
1,Surf Nazis on DVD?,"I had to look twice to believe my eyes - putting this film on DVD is akin to putting ketchup on steak. Sure you could do it, but why would you? This film is so far beneath ""B"" quality it's no longer laughable. This flick is definitely reserved for tormenting your friends who were too busy with their studies to watch this when it made its way through the dorm vcr's. Still if you feel all collections require one bad film, you can't beat it."
3,Troma should stick to fart jokes and psychos,I liked the basic concept of this film but Troma's done better than this. It had a few bitchin moments but then fizzled at the end.Check out BUTTCRACK or HOLLYWOOD ZAP if you really want to see Troma doing what it does best - or worst.
1,Almost certainly the worst movie I have ever seen,"Surf Nazis on DVD - why? Sitting through this one was almost painful.If you are a connoisseur of bad films, this one might be for you. I can't even think of another movie I've seen that even approaches Surf Nazis level of quality (or lack thereof)."
2,even gives Troma a bad name,"This bomb possesses arguably the coolest title conceived by Troma. Too bad the content doesn't live up to the premise. One expects lowbrow entertainment from Troma, but there are few laughs in this plot about racial hatred. There are occasional memorable moments as biker Mama rides hell-bent for vengeance against teen nazis Adolf and Eva. But overall, ""Surf Nazis Must Die!"" is a SStinker. The teeshirt still gets comments at the gym, though."
1,The single worst movie in the history of the universe,"I'm ashamed to admit that I saw this film on VHS a long, long time ago. Some movies are so bad they are funny, ala Rocky Horror Picture Show or Toxic Avenger. This is not. This is a different level of terrible. It's so bad you can't just enjoy it for its badness. I have expunged most of it from my mind, and hopefully after another 25 years or so I won't even remember that I ever saw it. I've seen plenty of bad films, but this is the standard, the benchmark, the absolute rock bottom of the barrel. I suppose if you do watch it, then you'll always be able to say ""at least it wasn't as bad as surf nazi's must die"" so maybe that's why it deserves the one star instead of zero."
2,i love troma but this film actually was horrible,"i heard so many cool thing about this movie and when i watched it i thought it was horrible.i love troma films(my favs. are redneck zombies,sgt.kabuki man,waitress,bloodsucking freaks,hollywood zap,toxie1,cannabil:the musical,and troma's war)those films are classic,surf nazis is not.it bored the hell out of me.come on lloyd you can do better crap than this.troma stands for crappy movies-but not crap like this."
3,LADIES OF THE CANYON II,"I DON'T KNOW IF I EVER MET JONI MITCHELL BECAUSE HOLLYWOOD REFUGEES USE FAKE NAMES IN SAN DIEGO, CA. SOME BEER BELLY BIKER CLAIMED TO BE DAVID CROSBY IN ENCINITAS ONCE!!!"
4,"Tropical bummer, beach blast scummer","On a lonely night at my job I had the chance to Direct TV order a Free Movie known as SURF NAZIS MUST DIE. The movie is about gangs of surfers, armed with guns, knives, boats and books called KNITTING MADE EASY. Conflict erupts over the waves, the beach and the copies of KNITTING MADE EASY. You'll be saying ""aloha"" to a kind of tropical beach boring bungalo boogie meets Repo Man. The result is a strange, utterly existential art film about waves and conflict. The actors look like roadies for Love and Rockets, the music is relentless synthesizer washes that blend into slow motion violence and depressing beach scenes. Perfect gift for those considering a journey to a zombie infested island or wasted end of the road ""tropical"" bummer fests on the road of life. As an added bonus at the end of the movie you are given a chance to order products with money to create that beach bummer look that will last a lifetime or more."
2,Might Have Worked Better as a Short Film,"When it comes to low budget movies with a funny premise (i.e., elderly grandmother takes revenge on a gang of Neo-Nazi surfers), this is, unfortunate what I've expect (also see, for example, Jesus Christ: Vampire Killer)--the idea is better than it's execution. The film seems to focus on meaningless interactions between characters that do nothing to move the plot along, and all of the action takes place in about the last 10 minute. There are several places where you may think things will start to pick up, but it never does. Edited down to about 20 minutes, this could have made for a mildly amusing short film; as it is, it's just overwrought and boring.Of course, if you're like me, you are going to watch this movie no matter what you read about it--and you should! But, this is not a ""so bad it's good movie,"" it's more of a ""What the hell did I just watch?"" type of movie."
1,GOOD ONLY THE FIRST TIME YOU SEE IT,"THIS IS GOOD THE FIRST TIME YOU SEE IT,BUT THE SECOND TIME IT'S JUST NOT VERY ENTERTAINING. IT'S ABOUT A BLACK MOM WHO TAKES REVENGE ON THE NAZIS WHO KILLED HER SON,LEROY."
3,"What a good, bad movie.","Come on,. Its a TRAMA film. Did anyone expect to win a academy award?It one of those, Must see bad films, Like Plan 9 From outerspace, Lair of the White worm,. You need to laugh at How Bad It IS!Then you will truely enjoy a good movie.."
1,Ugh!,"This has got to be the worst movie of all time. It wasn't even funny. If I watch a bad B movie, I at least expect some humor like the Airplane or Police Squad movies. This movie was just plain bad."
2,"Sorry, I don't share the same view as the majority.","I had a difficult time ""getting into"" this book and could hardly wait to finish reading it."
4,Even Better Than the First One!,"As much as I loved the first book, A Free Man of Color, the second in the series was even better in some ways. Hambley plays her strongest card in this book--her fantastic command of characterization. Once I got to the last 1/3 of the book, I literally could not put it down. My only complaint--the end left me wanting more!"
2,Not what I expected,"I thought that this video would contain information about the actual town, the people who live there, the interests they have, the isolation they muct experience, what the town looked like. Instead it's focus was primarily on the Aboriginal people and the drought. While this was all important and basic to Alice Springs, I don't think that it should have encompased the entire video--there was nothing about the normal, average people living there, nothing about the town--no tourist stuff in other words. While not, perhaps, meant to be a tourist video, I do think that showing some highlights (surely there must be some) of this unique city might have been shown. I did not need to learn about the aboriginal drinking problems or quite so much about the one major station owner."
2,Did anyone bother to edit this book?,"I largely agree with the comments of the other people who gave _Cosm_ a 2. I'd just like to add that it was poorly edited. Two examples follow: In more than one instance, research assistants are referred to as undergraduates after they have been introduced as graduate students. Also, on page 167 (hardcover) a graph is displayed with 10^4, 10^5, 10^6, (powers of 10) on the x-axis. Two pages later, while discussing the graph, the characters state that the axis is labelled 4, 5, 6, etc...While I'm irritated by little things like spelling errors, I can usually read over them. _Cosm_ suffers from a criminally bad job of editing that makes a mediocre story worse."
2,Benford fumbles interesting premise,"Once again, Benford shows us how real scientists work. But these scientists are curiously detached from the world around them and as a result the larger implications of the Cosm are only headlined but never explored. In fact, the protagonist's lack of concern for scientific ethics and the consequences of her research are disturbing."
1,"Flat, boring, stagnant",I have read other books by Greg Benford and have been surprised by the difference among them. His weakness is characterization - they just sit there No true internal development; this was especially true in this case where he stars as a young black cosmologist. The premise sounded great (don't they all) but NOTHING HAPPENED. The characters never really showed any excitement over what could have been a defining moment in science. I was still waiting after the last page for the action to begin. I can't think of one memorable experience from this book I will keep. Don't waste your time with this one!!!
2,Waited for something to happen - nothing happened!,I kept hoping that the book would have a point. Nothing really emerged. Usually Benford tells a story. This one is slow reading with a few contrived chase scenes thrown in without reason.
1,Bad bad bad,"I bought this book because the plot idea sounded great. It still does to me, and I wish someone would write a good book about it. Cosm is condescendingly simple, especially about science (molecules! wow!) and people (dialog and characters). When I tossed the book aside after a couple of pages (chosen at random throughout the book) my wife, who reads John Grisham, looked at the first page, chuckled at the wooden cliches, and also tossed it aside. I don't read much fiction, but I did just finish Babbitt, by Sinclair Lewis, and that is some mighty fine writing, and nothing cosmic happens at all. Don't waste your money on Cosm; Benford is capitalizing on the current cosmology craze, and it's not even good sci-fi. Insulting."
4,You need a degree to understand it,"It looks like the customer reviews are all over the scale - some hate this book, some love it. I thought it was a good book. As a semi-scientist, I thought the characters were accurate and interesting. However, the physics was hard to understand. I've had classes in modern physics, but it wasn't enough for me to really understand what was going on. I wish the author had spent more words on the physics and less on the portrayal of scientists in action. I think only people with a degree in physics could understand the science in the book, which is ironic since the whole point behind the book was to introduce non-scientists on how real scientists work."
2,6 good ideas do not a novel make,"I eagerly picked up this title when I saw it was out. As a scientist, I've always appreciated Benford and Cosm looked like an excellent prospect. Unfortunately, the book is strictly linear, with gobs of filler in between the 5 or 6 good ideas that it contains. Unlike the best in SF, Cosm does not present the reader with a small view into a much larger place. Instead, it reads like a mechanical excercise in churning a book out. Benford can and should do better. A disappointment. Only saving grace is the insiders look at the world of big science."
4,"Good story, good characters, great science!","Set at Brookhaven and UC Irvine only a few years from now, this story manages to capture the excitement of scientific discovery and the wonder of modern cosmology, while presenting a good story with interesting characters. Comparable to some of the best by Forward or Baxter. Sorry, no space battles or scary aliens, but top-notch, completely accurate, and believable science."
1,Commits the ultimate literary sin,"Benford is one of those writers who wax hot and cold. He is acclaimed to be a science fiction writer's ""scientist"" in that he deals with a lot of ""hard"" science. In this case, the result is pedantic and - the ultimate sin - boring. The main character was not exciting nor interesting - just smart. The great experiment and the result were so-so. I kept waiting for something - ANYTHING - to happen but soon realized that this was it..a globe that was tested, studied and explored. I am reminded of the poem...""this is how the world ends - not with a bang but with a whimper."""
1,This one needs a no star rating!,"Why did the people who gave this book a bad review, give it 2 stars? One was plenty! Also, he must have a lot of good friends to send in the 5 star reviews. Nuff-said!"
3,"Cool Science-Fictional Idea, but...","COSM is a really cool science-fictional idea (5 stars) grafted onto a mediocre love story (2 stars) and flavored with a dollop each of ethnic and gender diversity (""E"" for effort), all set against a realistic backdrop of contemporary academic strife and realistic scientific process (4 stars). This tale would have worked much better as a novelette, but strung out to novel length, it seemed to drag a bit. I'm averaging it out to an overall 3-star rating."
2,not so good science and not so good characters,"The notion of creating a universe in the lab is fascinating in itself, but the story spun around it must also be interesting. COSM does not present a story that interests me, on the contrary. I found the characters and what they did very boring, the whole plot seems to be centered on issues that are quite trivial considering the weight of the subject (universe in a lab): the heroine's amateur-like struggle and way of plotting to keep the cosm out of reach of the other petty scientists' hands, etc. Wow, that I call true inspiring and visionary science fiction! There certainly are more interesting tales out there that start with less and accomplish more, e.g. Clarke,Cube-McDowell: The Trigger. But maybe one should not blame Mr Benford to much --- how do you make a page-turner out of a book that start out with a major event such as a newborn cosmos in your lab?"
5,A look at real-world science,"COSM gives the reader a look at the real world of scientific research. In many ways it doesn't read like a science-fiction novel; the characters don't solve all their problems, and are confused and lost much of the time. The premise of the book is stunning: our hero, a black woman physicist, has-- or so it seems-- created an entire universe in a high-energy physics experiment. Unlike a typical science-fiction plot, however, she is not out to save the universe, or even change the world. She just wants to understand what she has found, and what it tells us about physics. Meanwhile, rival physicists want to steal her discovery, and her credit. I loved it; it was a great window into real-world science."
2,"Sci-Fi can be good literature, but Benford's hand is heavy","COSM was recommended by a friend who reads a wide variety of science fiction. I grew up reading authors like Heinlein, Dick, Silverberg, Brunner, and Clarke, so from her glowing praise, I assumed this fellow Benford was a writer with similar skills. My assumption was wrong.Let's just say that characterization, dialog, and creating suspense are areas where Gregory Benford needs a lot of practice. He's a physicist, so the science in COSM is OK, but writing good science fiction requires more than getting a few buzz words and acronymns correct.With some editing, this novel might serve as a screenplay for an average X-Files episode."
3,"Academics good, character not","Gregory Benford's COSM was a very fun book to read. Benford described the politics of academia quite well and without sounding petty. In addition, his presentation of the 'pocket universe' was very interesting and well described for those of us who do not have Ph.D.s in physics. Of course I expect such expertise from Benford and don't think I can add anything to the comments by such luminaries as Marvin Minsky and Freeman Dyson that appear on the dust cover. The book has some weaknesses, however. Benford's ambitious attempt to get into the mind of a black female fell a little short. He relied on stereotypes and ignored many racial issues, justifying his choices by calling his protagonist a scientist and thus outside of racial (and most sexual) issues. Overall, this is a good and pleasant read, but mainly for the science, not for the main character."
1,sugary and superficial,"Giorgia is the equivalent of a pound of white sugar, it hits you hard and then it lets you down!Teeny bopper at best, superficial and inconsequential"
4,Worth the wait to have his import arrive.,Heard her first with Andre Bocelli and since then have tried to find a CD by her.She has put out a fine CD that will please anyone who enjoyed her singing with Andre. Maybe two weak songs. All in all she has got a great voice! Thanks AMZN for making it easy to obtain this CD.
5,Bellissima...,"I can't say enough about this album. I first heard of Giorgia on a trip to Italy when I came across one of her older albums. Her amazing voice grabbed my attention on the first song. She has such a beautiful voice which makes this album a pleasure to listen to. Moreover, she sings about feelings that she has obviously experienced - otherwise she's done a great job of imagining those experiences - each and every word sung with such emotion. Standouts for me are 'Dimmi che ci tieni' and 'Il cielo in una stanza', though I haven't been able to stop playing the entire album since I bought it. I think you'd enjoy this album whether you understand the language or not, it's that fantastic. Plus the words are included in the album sleeve, so even if you don't understand them, you can still sing along!"
4,still cant believe this happened,"The book was very well written, mostly from the point of view of the townspeople and Sheriff Wells, but not one sided at all. I was a little disappointed the story ended before the trial was even set."
3,It kept me reading...,"This case has haunted me since I first heard about it. This is the second book I've read, the first being ""Mother Love, Deadly Love"" by Andrea Peyser. I liked both books, but this one seems to put you there. I was in Union, S.C. one year after it happened, I was travelling through from Columbia, and I stopped and ate at the Quincy's Restaurant. I'm from Missouri, and everything down there seemed so spooky, especially the kudzu. This book tells it like it happened. I can't imagine how Susan can sleep at night."
4,Ended too soon,"This book was very well written. However, it ended way too soon. Far better, I feel it would have been, to wait for the outcome of a case before publishing the book because it leaves the reader hanging. My favorite book on this case still remains""Beyond All Reason,"" written by David Smith, the father of the slain boys."
1,WORST BOOK TO HELP GUYS UNDERSTAND WOMEN,"This is by far the worst book in the history of dating books. The author (who is a woman) talks about what she wants from a guy and tries to make the reader think that all women want it. The author basically makes men think that women are goldiggers (which is absolutely false). She says that you need a nice car, money, nice clothes and that you need to spoil a girl in order for you to date her and continue dating her.I read about 1/2 this book and I was disgusted with it. As a matter of fact I threw it in the trash."
1,Worst book on dating I've ever read,"You've heard of the dating book for women called ""The Rules"".. well, this might as well be the companion book to it.. the book for men on how to play by THEIR rules. Her advice? Get a higher paying job, buy a fancy sports car, dress nicely, always pay for everything on a date, and buy a woman flowers to show her you're interested.All this book will teach you to do is how to be the nice, boring,supplicating guy that a woman will dump, as soon as she is seduced by a man who's been reading all the RIGHT books on dating.The real kicker is, the title of the book is ""understanding women"" and yet the actual advice of the book is, women are impossible to understand, so you'd better just follow all these rules if you want any chance of being worth dating. This is total B.S. and I'd recommend pretty much any other book out there on dating.. written for men from a MAN'S point of view, on how to actually be successful with women."
1,Jesus....and other Sigh Remarks!,"Bro...if you want to wind up a wimp who's starting an Avon club or enjoy doing the dishes,...then purchase this book. Actually, if you want to be successful in the dating world...buy this book...and ""do the exact opposite"" of what the author advises (lol). First of all, a women cannot teach a man how to pick up another women. Why? Because women are the most confused creatures on God's green earth and certainly another women is just as confused about what she likes and dislikes. Read surveys on what women like, then see them in real life; They do the exact opposite of what they wrote in their survey answers. Unless you want a book on ""what not to do"" to meet and date attractive women, find a better book....they are out there."
4,"Good, sensible advice for the average guy","This book is good for the average guy. I have referred back to this book a couple of times just to remind myself of some of the basics. The book does a good job of covering many basic topics from what to wear, talking to women, treating women, how to act. The good thing is the author doesn't try to make you do outlandish things like other books tell you. The other helpful thing about the book is that the book is short and gets to the point very quickly."
2,Very Weak,"This book just arrived last night and I read the first 84 pages and thought to myself ""what a waste"" The writing and mentality is that of someone who's 21-25 years of age who stayed up one night jotting down ideas for a dating book. This book is written for young men under the age of 25. For instance in one chapter titled ""wheels"" she starts off by saying ""have a nice set of wheels"" two pages later she start off the chapter by saying ""get a good paying job"" as if one can just walk out of his current job and land a better paying job right off the bat to impress the woman he desires. Unless you're totally in the dark about women and dating this book will do nothing for you but reiterate things you should already know. A much better book for men is How to Succeed with Women and a better book on attraction is 'Irresistable Attraction' by Hogan and LaBay. Whatever you do, don't waste your time with this one."
2,Might help if you're really clueless,"I might have found this book useful when I was a teenager. It's got some decent basic insight, but not a lot, and it also has some things I totally disagree with, like the advice to spend lots of money on women, and get a second job if one doesn't have enough money to do that. Some women might stick around longer for more free stuff, but it won't buy anyone's respect or affection.What I really don't like about the book is the insulting tone, especially in the beginning. The attitude is the reader must be a serious loser, why else would you be reading the book.There are many much better books out there on understanding women, don't waste your money on this one."
2,just plain ol' common sense,"I bought this booking thinking it would give me some secret advantage over other guys in meeting more women, but after reading it in one sitting I feel like I wasted a few hours of my life reading this crap. Any guy who has a mother, already knows all the info in this book. Don't waste your money buying this trash, [...]."
2,Crap,"This book will give you some good advise on how to get into the ""Friends zone"" with women, but will not give any advise on how to properly attract a woman. Really misses the boat on attraction methods that will not distinguish you from any other guy, by doing stuff like buying her flowers and chocolates on the first date. Real Lame!! But I guess it's a good first step for somebody who is completely hopeless, but there is better stuff out there."
1,Are you serious?,[...] I guess if you don't have any it's worth it.Who doesn't know to keep themselves clean? To wear nice clothes? To smile when approaching a girl? Not to paw a woman? To be courteous/polite? If you don't know it already how will you learn it from this book? I guess it's a confidence booster. At least you'll believe that you're doing the right things.In any case the fifteenth strike comes from it's width. You'll be able to read this book in under an hour. Go have a conversation with a friend who's a girl. Forget this.
1,Worthless,"I bought this after I broke up with a few chicks.I personally found this book worthless. It's full of the cliches about dating that drive me utterly crazy. Such as, ""bring a girl a gift on the first date"". Are you kidding me? Do you want to be labeled as the clingy, needy guy? C'mon. It also reeks of ""putting your woman on a pedestal"" personally, i want someone who is my equal, not something i worship.Anyhow, I think your money is better spent elsewhere."
5,Awesome book with good insight,"This book written by Romy surely helps you to learn and understand a little more about the women out there you will encounter. One of the few books i've found to give you more insight to dating.Another great book that i've found and that I strongly recommend is "" How to get the woman of your dreams using the Internet"" Once I read this book it showed me how to get just about any woman online for dating or actually whatever it is your looking for. Absolutely the most informative I've read thus far!"
1,"Understanding Women: The Definitive Guide to Meeting, Dating and Dumping, If Necessary","I just read this book which took 2 hours. For me, the author goes out of her way to voice her bitterness towards any guy who is looking to date and invents her own pyscho-babble and reiterates what all common sense who tell anyone. She is at time vulgar, mean, and insulting.The read is very much like reading a person who got dumped and wrote a book to blast any single guy as a way to cope.It offers common sense advice, so if you want to buy a book telling you all the things you should already know or have heard, this is the book for you. Don't waste your money is my opinion!For me, it is like reading a book from a 15 year old girl who got her heart stomped on, very immature in parts and the author goes out of her way on advice how to date her and not what all women are thinking necessarily."
1,Not worth the money!!,This book is very basic and tells you what a guy should do in order to meet a girl. All the things that are mentioned in this book is what I already know and for some reason is what most men know. I wouldn't suggest this book but would search around for something else. I wanted to know more about the flirting signs with women and how to flirt to get their attention. That is the problem I have is the flirting aspect of dating. Dont get this book it is too basic!!
3,written by a woman,"This book was'nt bad.Basic message:have your act together if you even want a chance to date a decent girl.Look good ,have a nice car,a nice house,a good job.Thought it was actually good advice but where does that leave you if you don't have all these things?Contradicted a lot of advice given in pick up books(for instance The Lay Guide).If you're not dating at all or not much would definetly recommend.If you're trying to meet women that are knockouts and used to men approaching them all the time her advice is still solid if you have good looks the house etc etc."
3,inside women 's head,"quite good book.It's my fourth book on the subject.Usefull to understand women point of view and expectations in dating and, later on, in the early stage of a relationship.Nothing really new, only common sense, you can say, yes but some time this is what really needs.No pick up lines, no techniques, no speed up dating. It shoots higher: developing the right attitude to deal healthy with women: be confident, improve yourself, be always honest and loyal, never revenge.Easy to be read. More emphasys on some topics will be appreciated. It's worth the reading.To make a further step in women's head I suggest reading: Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus."
3,Good thoughts. Bad grammar. Spelling errors throughout.,"This book presents some very helpful information in an abrupt style. There are many good points, and Miller uses numerous real life examples to reveal some mistakes that are often made by men. However, it is obviously a publish-yourself book that nobody spent too much time editing. It is riddled with spelling and grammar errors."
1,dreadful....,"dreadful book...yet another men's dating book on how to attract gold-diggers,pscho chicks and men haters,by supplication,grovelling and bill paying...guys do yourselves a favour and read instead:-1) in sheep's clothing by george k simon2) booby trapped men beware by june marshall3) the predatory female by rev shannon4) ""venus""/""that bitch"" by roy sheppard/mary t cleary(highly recommended)the last book (4) is the best book as it summarises the main points of books(1)to(3) and gets men to focus on the reality of modern day women!!!beware of negative comments by cpltm (maybe the book's author in disguise) if like a lot of the reviewers you are given this book 1/2 stars!!!"
1,NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL!!!,"As I was reading this, I just couldn't shake the feeling that this was written by one more man hating witch, and her ""cruel to be kind"" approach is just so freakin' phony!!! If you're a guy who's starting to believe that men and women aren't teammates to each other anymore, this book is your proof!!!"
1,Bad advice!,"The essence of Mrs. Miller's advice? Be a nice guy, take a bath, buy a 'hotter' car, get a better job, look at the girl until she gives you a sign. If she does walk up to her, say 'hello' and wait for her response. Should she (unlikely, isn't it?) STILL be interested, ask her (no kidding) about her job... :DAs you might know best form your own experience, this is exactly, what millions of frustated guys around the world are doing over and over again without any success. Wanna be (and stay) one of them? Go on and read this book. Some of her advice is so stupid and obviously the best way to crash & burn, it made me LOL - so I at least had some fun reading it. But fun is not what you're seeking, is it?Romy might understand women, but she does not understand seduction - and really can't tell you anything about it. Women should not understand seduction - if so, they'd be able to resist. ;)Try Louis's & Copeland's 'How to succeed with women' and Tony Clink's 'Layguide' instead."
2,There are better books,"Okay, it is the third times that I try to write a less positive feedback about this book... So again, this book gives good advices but also lots of bad advices. It is true that if you treat women with kindness and play the compassionate, decent gentleman, it completely turns them off! However, dropping a lot of money or acting like a ""nice guy"" to them is the kiss of death. Everything women claim to want in men do not really works. The only way to pick them up is to act with fun and as if you do not really care : jokes, smile, confidence, few compliments, no dinners, no drinks.[...]"
2,Very basic and narrow-minded,"I might have been looking for something a little more advanced, but this book seriously is ""Dating for Dummies."" For example, be well-groomed, have good manners, be confident? Thanks, but although I ordered this book, I haven't been living under a rock for the past thirty-five years. The bottom line here is that you won't find anything earth-shattering, all the tips are very basic. Besides that, the author is somewhat arrogant in her writing style.Trust me, guys. If you have a ninth-grade understanding of what it takes to get a woman, you're already past this book."
1,Common sense knowledge.,"I have written a negative review previously and somehow Amazon deleted it. Other people in the post who also gave a negative review complained that their review got deleted as well. About the book. Almost all things listed in the book is common sense knowledge even teenage kids should know. The author talks about to succeed in dating you should have good grooming, have a nice pad and should have a nice car. You should also have good table manners during meals and so on. Unless a man lived in a cave all his life, this is something we all learned as teenagers. After finishing the book I felt that it was a total waste of time and money."
2,Good if you are in high school,"This book is the worst of 5 books I have purchased and read from amazon.com. This has incredibly basic stuff like make sure to shower and brush your teeth if you want to succeed with women. The Game, The Layguide, The Mystery Method, The Professional Bachelor, and Irresistible Attraction are much better suited to guys who want to succeed with meeting and landing women, and you don't have to be sleazy to do it. Dating is a game, and women do have the advantage. Those books helped a nice guy to know the right things to do and say to do very well with women. This book, Understanding Women, DID NOT. Romy Miller and all women would like it if more men behaved the way she is instructing you to behave. That would ensure that women will continue to have the advantage, and men will continue to kiss their behinds. That is just my 2 cents. Thanks."
5,Greatest Wiley; Best Restoration,"These are among the greatest Songbook interpretations ever, with the cream of NY studio jazzmen accompanying the wonderous Lee Wiley. Icing on the cake: we can now hear these recordings at the proper pitch. Tin-eared reviewers aside, the tape transfers that were used through so many previous reissues were sped up to an improper pitch. That has been rectified here, and it sounds like we're in the studio with Lee and the boys. This should be nothing short of a revelation for those of us who have listened to these recordings so often for so long. Buy the whole series while you can!"
5,Best Re:mix album of all Time,This is the best cd of all the DCtalk solo stuff it has 2 remixes of the best song IRENE J-Train also has 2 remixes featuring Kirk Franklin your remix collection is incomplete without MOMENTUM RE:MIX
2,BEWARE other reviewers have only reviewed ZIA! SUSPECT!,Be aware that the other reviewers have only reviewed ZIA products and therefore may not be impartial.Sad.
5,"Zia Ultimate Eye Creme - DEEP, RICH MOISTURE","This eye creme is so lovely -velvety to the touch, with a light & elegant scent, it delivers loads of moisture to my over 50 delicate eye area. I apply it under sunscreen each morning and after cleansing at night. I cannot imagine having to use another product since I discovered Zia about 2 months ago. In my opinion, this is the best emollient eye creme on the market today."
5,A real winner,"A delightful read, wonderfully romantic and funny. Diane Amos has a gift when it comes to love wit and children! Winner Takes All was one of the funniest books I've read this summer. This author should be on your keeper list."
5,Absolutely wonderful book for Nurse Mangers,"This is one of the most helpful and interesting nursing books to come out in the last several years. All my friends (nurses at least) will be getting this for Christmas, birthdays, etc. Pat Yoder-Wise was recently voted 'Outstanding Teacher' by the graduate students at her university. Her book is equally outstanding."
4,Beyond Leading and Managing: Nursing Administration for the Future,Simply great for beginners. It's clear and understandable; can relate to and is applicable to real life situations.
4,Great Seller!!! Product as described......shipping slow.......,Product as described. Good communication skills from seller. Shipping time was slow. It took almost 3 weeks to ship a book to Iowa. I would purchase from this seller again.....if you have a time constraints.....Perhaps clarify shipping times prior to purchasing. If you don't have time issues.....he's a good communicator and his prices are fair.
2,24x39 Blue Horizons Doormat,These mats are sturdy and do keep most debris from getting inside the house.....BUT...I specifically ordered them because of the blue trim to match my new shutters...within a week they were faded to a bright turqoise...I expected much more for the price...
3,Arrived damaged but still worth keeping.,Product arrived damaged due to poor packing. The productitself is well worth the price and that's the reason I decidedto keep it anyway. Highly recommended.....just poorly packed.
2,"It's cute, but thinner than picture and glitter falls off quickly","It's a really cute collar, but the glitter started fading off almost immediately. Normally my dog wears the same collar for about 6 months but this one only had a 2 month lifespan. The leash clip is also a little tight against the collar itself which made it hard to clip the leash on."
1,old dvd,thought this dvd was a more up to date one but its an old version. clothes they wear are old. its like for older folks.
2,Meh . . .,The title track is the only decent song on this album. The rest of the album is taxing. I own the a lot of Velvet Underground and Lou Reed. I don't think this this album is worth buying unless you're simply trying to complete your collection.It's pretty bad.
1,GOT SICK,"I purchased the smoothie bible after having the juicing bible for a long time. Let me tell you that I LOVE the juicing bible. But after getting the smoothie bible it is almost the exact same thing as the juicing bible...matter of fact, there are the same recipes in both.But the biggest thing is that I made the Flu Fighter #1 smoothie and myself and my 4yo daughter got SEVERELY ill. I made the recipe using raw elderberries (as mentioned in the book) and I had a severe reaction: vomiting and diarrhea. I read later online that elderberries contain cyanide (that is neutralized when cooked) and should NOT be consumed raw. I would think that Pat Crocker, being an herbalist, should have known or mentioned this somewhere in the book and NOT suggested consuming raw elderberries in her recipe."
5,"Creative Recipes, Helpful Health Advice","This book offers tasty, unique recipes and lots of them. It also offers an extensive list of health issues (including ADHD, Anxiety, Endometriosis, Eye Problems, Gout...) paired with a definition, fruit, vegetable and herb recommendations and a list of foods to avoid. Of course each health concern is also paired with a list of smoothies that include beneficial foods."
2,Diapointed: Too Much of the Same Thing,"I wanted a book with good smoothie recipes. I did an impulse buy and bought this based on B.Marold's rambling review found on this page. While some of the recipes are good. Most of them are just slight variations of the many other recipes found in this book. Alot of nutrition facts, too, But I don't really care about that. I'm 23 year old guy who like smoothies and things laid out simple. I was hoping to get smoothies like I get at juice bars, but this book only had recipes like the ones I found for free while surfing the net. It's the bible all right, and it will take you a lifetime to get thorugh it!"
3,Lame...,"I have to agree with Trevor. There isn't much creative thought involved in these smoothies. The vast majority of them could be classified as ""Simple Smoothies."" I was hoping for at least a bit of complexity in some of the recipes. Most recipes appear to combine two or 3 flavors but not much more. If you like it simple, then this is the book for you."
3,Much the Same,"There is some good information, but much of it was the same as in other books, take care of eat well, exercise, keep your brain active, etc. It does have helpful information for those who are being a caretaker for an elderly person. It gives pointers for their care, and also for picking a convalescent home."
1,Not well suited as an introductory learning text,"This book was the required reading for an introductory class to the subject of industrial relations and collective bargaining. Experienced in the business world, I found this text difficult at best to follow, especially in terms of an historical time-line. I found the material extremely fragmented in presentation, seemingly jumping from one focus to another. It was a challenge to associate the context with the section headers, as the flow was not comfortably predictable. The text often assumes a prerequisite of knowledge that I didn't expect of introductory course material. The book also introduces terminoloy (often in bold text) and concepts upon which it never elaborates. Overall, I did not find the text supportive to learning. I relied heavily on online resources to fill in the gaps in order to pass the course."
1,Very poor reception,"I had a Linksys PCMCIA card, which finally died. It worked pretty well, except that I had the router downstairs and it had to transmit through several walls. I added the range extender antennae to the router and could receive anywhere in my 2700 sft home. I replaced the Linksys card with the Belkin and could not log on in hotels or airports while traveling. Furthermore, I have since moved my router upstairs and am sitting 16 feet from it with the range extender antennae and I keep getting dropped signals. My other two computers have no problem picking up reception even though they are 1/2 the home away. I am presently in the market for a new PCMCIA card. I have heard that the 'Orinoco' chipset provides the best range. John B. Egan"
2,"OK, but really expensive.","Not close to being worth the price, but OK. Guess you pay for the badge, but it really could cost less."
1,Poor quality control.,It worked fine initially until the connector became detached. There is a retainer nut inside that came off and it is impossible to reattach it. So the unit is now scrap scrap!
2,smart mug,The placement of the temp control is in the way for drinking. I gave this as a gift and the person didn't like the way it sat in his cup holder or the way it worked. Bad gift idea.
1,Lasted less than 2 weeks!,We're very disappointed with this mug. Gave it to my husband for Christmas. He's used it 4 days and it was fine. 5th day it was dead. Piece of junk!!!
2,Not hot cup,"First the cup is top heavy.The real problem is it takes for ever to get hot.I thought it was so you set the heat and would be done. No-- you have to keep pushing a button to the heat you want, but when it reaches say lukewarm and you want hot it resets itself to lukwarm, then you have to push again to reset again and again to get to hot. Not to good while driving in LA traffic..I just made a 250 mile trip in my car and my cup never went more than lukewarm but one time to Hot. Problem is I stopped to gas up and it reset itself to Room Temp. Finally threw out the coffee and bought a cup togo.."
2,Need my money back!,"I used it for a couple of weeks then the charger broke now I can't use it. I should have take heed to the reviews and did not get this piece of junk. I wish I can have my money back, I paid $31 including shipping I think that's too much for a 2-week use."
1,A Disappointing Product,"The features of this product seemed promising to me. Reality didn't fufill expectation, however. The handle broke off when I adjusted its position in my car's cup holder. After two weeks the electronic system built into the mug failed. Not only does the temperature indicators stay blank, but the heater no longer warms the coffee at all. I believe this item is made by a Chinese firm. China has given the world silk, gunpowder, and printing. A shame it has been premature in giving us a reliable travel mug."
1,"""Smart-Mug"" NOT a wise buy.","Where should I start? 1, Not fast to heat. 2, Too tall/narrow/tippy in any mug-holder that I know of. 3, Placement of power cord input on mug is Not handy. 4, Lid closed still leaves a 1/8"" hole for liquid to leak/splash out of when you hit a bump or jostle the mug. 5, Exterior finish on ""Stainless Steel"" Smart-Mug has a clear urethane, or some other coating that is very easily marred and chips off. 6, Stand this mug on a table top? DONT BUMP THE TABLE It barely stands on its own. 'Nuff said. Find a different heated mug."
1,This is the worst!,Everytime I try to set a temperature it keeps beeping why? I keep hearing a clicking sound as well. Is anyone else having this problem because as far as I see it this just and ordinary mug with extra elements read temp....heating does not work it sucks it the worst!
2,Very slow heating and very complicated,"It is not of much use , they make system very complicated to use and water warm very slow , when I need , it is taking too much time when my child need warm water and usage is very complicated."
1,BAD DESIGN,"I bought one of these and was terribly disspointed. It is extremely top heavy and , as such, is prone to tip over - especially in the car! The heating feature is OK, but it stopped working before I threw the whole thing out. Suggest not purchasing."
4,Good Quality but the Cord isn't Interchangeable,"This is a good quality mug. I tried many stores to find a cord that fits this mug but couldn't. You might as well buy two so you can have a cord for each car. The same company also makes a version that plugs into a USB. It's perfect for a person with long commutes who doesn't even lukewarm coffee, but who does? I haven't been using it long enough to speak to it's sturdiness."
2,Dribbling talents underrated,"I bought this item after reviewing comments on it and several other alternatives. Though its heating capabilities were as advertised, comments did not reveal a damning flaw. This is a dribble cup in disguise. It should be sold to pranksters as a novelty item. It splashed all over my shirt, coat and pants. I had to get my coat cleaned. It stems from a design flaw. The wide lip allows coffee to spread out to the sides as you drink. It stays there, waiting to spill over the edge the next time you draw the cup to your mouth."
2,Worked for less than a month,My wife gave me this as a gift and I do not use it everyday (10-12 times in the past month). It just broke this morning as the plug piece came out of the mug and the piece it threads into is broke off inside the mug. It worked for a short while but now I am without a heated travel mug for my long commutes for work. Will not purchase this brand again.
4,Works as advertised,"The product works as advertised. Set the temperature to your desired level and once it gets there, the mug maintains that temperature. The only reason why I didn't rate this a 5 star, is because the fuse blows every couple of months. Once you replace the fuse (5A 250 volts)the mug is back in operation. I like the mug a lot. It works for my needs."
1,If there is a warranty...use it,"At first I really liked the product, and it came in the mail very quickly (2 days). After 2 weeks, already not working. The item was never submerged in water, as they warned, and the fuse in the plug was fine too. I have no idea what could have gone wrong here, but I will be sure not to buy from these folks again."
5,Fascinating Content,"A good book always makes you think about its particular subject in a new way. Robert Hagstrom's new book, Latticework: The New Investing will definitely have the reader thinking about investing differently. The book develops the notion of combining insights from many different disciplines (biology, physics, and literature to name a few) to develop worldly wisdom. If the investor develops their own mental models (and understand how the interact with one another) they can develop a competitive advantage over most investors. Mr. Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, has endorsed this mental models concept in two separate speeches he has given."
4,"""Investing: The Last Liberal Art"" and ""Latticework: The New Investing"" are the same book","""Investing: The Last Liberal Art"" and ""Latticework: The New Investing"" are exactly the same book with exactly the same content up to the page numbers. Just the book name and book cover were changed. It's not clear why the publisher changed the book name but after purchasing both books I find highly misleading."
3,Poorly organized with small type,"This book is a perfect size for travelers, it fits nicely in a pocket, but in shrinking the size, the publishers shrank the type as well, to the point where it is difficult to read.More serious is the lack of organization -- much of the information is redundant and poorly classified. It appears to have been thrown together without much editing.For larger cities, these defects would render it unacceptable, but it is difficult to find good travel books on Crete, and the content is better than most, which is why I rated it 3 stars."
2,Not worth it,"This book had a variety of interesting tid-bits, but was not very useful. The Top 10 format (Top 10 Tavernas, Beach Resorts, Eating and Drinking Tips, Cafes, Mountain Walks, Moments in History,etc.)isn't good for planning your trip. The information provided under each top 10 items is only a few sentences long, so it isn't even comprehensive enough for you to decide if you want to visit that place. It was also impossible to look anything up in this book because its order made no sense to me. I wouldn't buy another Top 10 book. I got Fodor's Greece guide and found that much better. The only thing better about Top 10 was actually the map of Crete."
4,A nice followup to Tiger My Friend,"I, like many others, was hypnotized by 'Cosy in the Rocket', a portion of which is used in the ABC drama 'Grey's Anatomy'. I purchased Psapp's first US release, Tiger My Friend, in May 2005 and have listened to it often. I'm not a heavy music consumer but I didn't hesitate to purchase these CDs (support independent labels!) I preordered this album mere days before it was due to be released; I received it only one day after the release. I am listening to it for the second time. I'm not sure if it will grow on me like Tiger did, yet - time will tell. I can say that listening to the last track, 'Upstairs', is best experienced in a quieter room with immersive headphones - the sound effects of creaking floors above are uncannily real. I guess this album doesn't seem quite as experimental and unique to me, but that's okay."
3,Ghostly goings-on or not?,"These discs are very entertaining, but at four hours, maybe too much of a good thing. There's something going on here, perhaps just an elaborate hoax, but nicely told at any rate. If you're interested in seeing some real séances, this is the place.The first disc is really two parts, the first an extensive interview, the second a seance...maybe...at a location in York.Disc 2 follows the same structure: a traditional documentary, with interviews of a number of researchers into the paranormal, then a journey and seance at the site: in this case, a pub in Salterforth.The 3rd disc is about a decommissioned nuclear bomb-shelter in Scotland, once top secret, now open to the public. It's suitably creepy, with full-sized mannequin's ""living"" there. A terrific location for a horror film."
5,Great Movie,It is very interesting to get an insight in to the lives of Hasidic Jewish Community in America and Europe.
2,Sort of Boring,"I think that if you're not from the Chassidic world, you might find this film interesting. However, if you are orthodox or know anything about Chassidim, there are no major revelations here. I didn't really find any of the interviewee's stories about breaking out of the Chassidic world very compelling. Basically all of their stories are the same, and even though they have managed to break out they still seem sad about it. This documentary should have either been about the couch or Chassidic drop outs, but I don't think that the two mixed very well."
5,just what the doctor ordered!,Teriffic value for a hard to find older style hard drive at an awesome price.. The old computer works like new!
3,"Series is good, annoying advertisements","This is one of my favorite anime shows, although it starts off a little cumbersome. The characters are fun, and the storyline develops very nicely. I jumped at the chance to get it on DVD. The quality is not bad, but my biggest gripe are the advertisements. Every disc has advertisement on it which you cannot skip out of (by hitting main menu), or skip through, or even fast forward! This is very, very annyoing. I bought the DVD because I don't want to look at ads!!!"
2,Great anime,"I love this anime but the dub is horrible, its among the worst i have ever heard. The guy that voices kuwabara is just plain awful, he tries way too hard and it just is the worst voice over i have ever heard, but the good news is it has the original japanese voices with subs, which is the only way i can watch it. Comparing the english to the original japanese its nowhere near as good. Bottom line is, its a great show if you like dragonball z and naruto and bleach and other anime like that, but be ready to read the subs because the dub is awful!!"
4,Yu Yu Hakusho rocks,I'm so glad I bought this box set. Yu Yu Hakusho is one of my favorite fighting anime ever. I got hooked watching it on Cartoon Network as a kid and have never regretted watching it. ^_^ This particular boxset is awesome. It has 2 slimcases with 4 discs total for 28 episodes. Compared to other anime which put ~4 eps to a disc you get to watch twice as much before having to make the switch. ^_^Plus the price can't be beat. I got my set for $21 and will be getting the second season for $19 since I preordered it. I've never seen anime so cheap! But its still great quality. I will be ordering the entire series from Amazon because no one else can beat these prices.
2,Oh C'mon Funimation!!!!!,Funimation JUST FINISHED putting out multiple episode DVD sets for the past 2 years and now they put out Season sets that cost twice as much but only include a few extra episodes. Whats the logic of this?
5,AWESOME SHOW,"All time favorite anime, but it ended too soon. Only four awesome seasons with an amazing group of characters. Really recommend this show to anyone, the series ending was pretty good, not totally disappointed by it. ^____^"
1,This was not good at all.,"This was by far the worst book I have read in a while. Who's perspective is this supposed to be from? It amazes me what can be published and saddens me that someone was paid to edit this. On the plus side, it gives me hope that I could write a novel better than this! Not to mention, that this is a total Outlander rip off."
2,Absolutely dreadful,"Having picked up the audio version, I had no idea this was a romance pretending to be a fantasy. The story makes no sense at any level. The characters are so one dimensional and not believable. There's no actual plot, and the fantasy element is just there as a back drop. In short, this was utterly atrocious and it reminds me of why I hate romance novels.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
2,"Not as good as the rest,","Kiss of the Highlander and The Dark Highlander are written far better. Beyond the Highland Mist is an odd side story and is better read by people who haven't read Moning before. Over-all this was pretty much a disappointment. She's a great writer, but this is definitely better suited for my grandmother."
1,buyer beware,"I thought this was one of the worst romance novels I ever read. First of all there was no romance. The hero was a perfect specimen of the male body. He also slept with more women than 50 men put together. Not at all my idea of a romantic figure. The heroine was immature and idiotic. What a stupid reason for not giving the hero a chance. Plus, she was also too perfectly formed to be believed. I hated the protagonist Adam. He was a spoiled little boy in a perfect man's body. The fact that this story was supposed to take place in Scotland was almost beside the point. If you are looking for a Highlands of Scotland book, this is not it.If you don't want to read a book about two men who have no redeeming qualities fighting over a woman who was too stupid to be believed, don't read this book. Romance was the very last thing this book was about."
1,Didn't even finish!,"First off, I was super excited by this book because I have read the author's Darkfever series and was totally impressed. I'll keep this short. The heroine was annoying and cruel and her premise of hating beautiful men and being alone in the world was superficial. I never grew to care about her. Though the sexual tension was good for the first few scenes, as she keeps rejecting the hero, it grew tedious.I think I'll steer clear of any modern time travel romances because they always seem too easy (they have an explanation for why the time traveler doesn't fit in, but understands the language-hello, its 1500's Scotland, they'd be speaking Gaelic!) and the male hero, happens to believe in magic so he doesn't find her time traveling odd.Save your money and read the author's Darkfever series!"
3,A nice introduction to Ms. Moning,"Beyond the Highland Mist is not the best from Ms. Moning but rest assured the entertainment never loses its grip. Adrienne de Simone is the New Orleans modern girl who gets transported to Scotland by Adam Black, the servant of the Faerie King and Queen, to taunt Laird Hawk Douglas whose sexual stamina and masculine beauty proves irresistible to the women of Scotland. Emotionally betrayed, the beauty resists Hawk's advances despite being tempted and touched by his growing passion and love. There is humor and sharp wit but not enough to rival the more substantial content found in her later works like The Dark Highlander. It is a good place for introduction though to Moning's immensely enjoyable yarns, spun with charm and heartwarming characters."
3,My Least Favorite Highland Book,"I've read this series completely out of order - thank goodness!! Had I started with this book, I'm not sure I would have continued. Compared with KMM's other books, this is stale and lifeless. It wasn't as fun as her other books. The hero seems like a great guy - not so sure the heroine deserves him. She dislikes him simply because he is good looking. We're supposed to feel bad for her because she was hurt before...but it just didn't click for me.All KMM's other books are 5 stars, this one just didn't do it for me..."
2,Where's the plot?,"In a way the characters were interesting, but pretty much one dimensional and did not always behave in ways that made sense. the worst was the plot, I just kept waiting for something to happen! Boring..."
4,Great!!,"What a great book! I typically don't like time-travel books, but I really enjoyed this one. Hawk was a great man. He truly seemed perfect in about every way. Adam was cleverly written. My only complaint is that Adrienne is a bit too shrewish and took too long to admit her feelings. I get a little tired of having one character who is clearly good and another character who chooses not to see this. But I am keeping this one and recommending it to my friends."
5,"Oh, wow this book was so good!","I can't say enough about this book. Let's put it this way, I didn't want it to end!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED READING THIS BOOK!I have read all of her books. Including the fever ones and this is STILL my favorite. I wish she would bring the charioteers back in one of her new books. Just spot a visit so we can see what is happening in their lives. It would be nice."
3,Decent romance novel,"This was my first book by Karen Moning but not my first romance novel. It's hard to give this book more than 3 stars since it was filled with many of the same, trite elements that other romance novels have. Although it seems like a unique idea, romantic time travel novels are very common and in order to remain distinct, other new elements must be introduced. The typical ""girl who plays hard to get"" plot has been overused countless times. Nonetheless, this book was enjoyable to read, just not extrodinary."
4,"Different, but not bad",I liked it. Some parts kind of had me biting my nails and wanting to slap the characters for not realizing the obvious. It was pretty good.
3,Good ending at least,"Time travel romances are so exciting because who wouldn't want to escape their hectic modern life and find love in another time? But in this book, the time travel element wasn't mentioned enough. I mean, she's thrown back in time, and within a few minutes she just excepts it and doesn't even try to tell anyone where she's from really. From then on it's just like she belongs there. There's nothing about her adjusting to the lack of modern conveniences or anything. And then when they beleive that she is from the future, no one even asks her any questions about what the future is like! Then there's the constant fighting with Hawk that gets annoying after a couple chapters. I loved the element of Adam Black and the fairies though and I'm looking forward to reading the book with him as the main character. If you want to read the series, might as well start with the first one. But this felt like I just wanted to get it over with."
4,Beyond the Highland Mist,"I really liked this book. I thought that both the hero and heroine were both strong characters. I loved the way Adrienne just fell back in time. Plus she likes cats so thats a definate plus. The character of Adam, even though he was a troublesome cad, maked the struggle of the hero to admit his love all the sweeter. I liked the hero's friend Grimm and look forward to reading his story. I would definately recommend this book. It kept me up till 3am finishing it!"
5,Fantastic read!,"I just love the way that Moning drags you off to a wonderful world of fantasy and adventure,with just the right amount of passion that keeps you at the edge of your seat. I couldn't help but fall immediately in love with the colorful characters. I can't wait to start the next book in the series."
3,A bit Sappy,"I loved Karen Marie Moning Fever series so I had strong expectations for this. Well It was a bit sappy for my taste. I know that this is the type of book this is but Hawk is suppose to be a Alpha male. Granite he is a Casanova to boot but I don't want my Alpha males speaking all ""girly"" lovey dovey. They are suppose to be big tough men. There is a point where I am rolling my eyes because it took to long for Hawk the Alpha male to just ""take"" what he wanted. It did get better at the end of the book. I also read the exerts at the end of this book and I think I will at least read Adams book if not the whole series. I just have to adjust to a different writing style from the author that I don't like as much as the Fever series."
2,"E for effort,","This is the second book I have read by Karen Marie Moning. I like to give writers at least a second chance at nabbing me up as a fan. I do love romance novels! But, this writer just didn't cut it for me. I truly wanted to like this writer as I have heard such wonderful things about her novels. But, the things I have heard did not turn out to be true. Beyond the Highland Mist was just sadly lacking. Lacking in spark, lacking in excitment, and lacking in story line. I will stick with the more sizzling writer like Holt, Graham, and Leone when it comes to romance. I'm bored with the supposed tried and true writers like Roberts, Howard, and this one."
2,Good story line gone bad...,"I had high hopes for this story and ""new to me"" author after reading the reviews. I was very dissapointed. I liked the idea of the story - fantasy, Scottland, manly-men, time travel, and romance. However, the book was too formulated, too predicatable and not that well written. It could have been so much better."
5,very satisfied with this purchase,This book was in even better condition than was stated and was a great deal. Thanks!
3,Hawk is a great hero,"Very enjoyable love story but here is the problem...one too many ""obstacles"" to the happy ending. I understand that part of building the tension in a romance novel is the obstacles which must be overcome but I think there should be a max to this device. Two or three obstacles is reasonable but ""Beyond the Highland Mist"" throws obstacle after obstacle at the couple; it was frustrating.The good points of this book just barely out weight the ""obstacle"" problem. A wonderful her and heroine; this is a couple you want to see have a happy ending. Their love is strong and passionate. I love romances where the hero woos the reluctant heroine."
4,very good,"I've read ""kiss of the highlander"" first and loved it so much. I've ordered all the books by this author!I really like this one too. but a big minus for the cover, I really don't like halfnaked people on the front of the book...I have to admit that I fell in love with the cover for ""kiss of the highlander"" and ""the highlander's touch"". That's why I bought them and I'm really not at all diappointed. the stories are great.Especially if you like fantasy, romance, fairy tales!I love the characters but mostly I'm curious about Adam Black and I hope to read a book about him!"
2,Disappointment,"After devouring Moning's fever series, I was so excited to read the Highlander series also by same author. Boy was I disappointed!!! It wasn't the worst book I have ever read. Yet another sappy romance novel. If I have to read one more romance novel where both heroine and hero fight their feelings and deny their love for one another I think I may gag! Unfortunately, I may be gagging for awhile as I bought the 1st four books in this series."
5,Fantastic audio book,I love every single one of Karen Marie Moning's books. Equally fabulous is Phil Gigante as a narrator. He brings every character to life.
3,3 stars,"This book started off really good and I couldn't put it down. I liked the heroine in the beginning, but midway into the book her character changed. Adrienne turned into a mean-spirited selfish brat. She came around towards the end, but I don't believe her character gave the hero the chance he deserved in the beginning. BTW, ""Hawk"", the hero, was everything you want in a hero. I just received the 2nd book in the series and I'm hoping that Grimm's story will be a little better."
4,Love this series!,"Each book is more or less stand alone, and I absolutely LOVE THEM! These are Highlanders, not so much paranormal, yet they are very entertaining. If you like the Black Dagger Brotherhood books, these are in the same vein. The stories are captivating and the romance steamy!"
1,Hated it!,"This book really disappointed me, so much so that I simply couldn't finish it. Adrienne's character was no more than a petulant child who, after learning 'no' as her first word, refused to say anything else. I'm all for a woman trying to preserve her virtue, but her character just came of as spoiled, unreasonable and contrary. I actually cheered when Grimm finally got sick of her and told her off! Then, rather than taking his words to heart, her pouty response is 'I'm not such a bad person.' PLEASE! Unless you are in to predictability and and frustration, I'd pass on this one."
5,Great book!,"This is a true romance book. I read the last one in the series first which got me hooked. I like the way it tells of both sides, the man and the woman's. Thanks for the series."
5,Loved It!!!,"After being completely engrossed in the Fever series by Ms. Moning it took me quite a while to get around to her other books. I didn't think she could top that series. While waiting for her newest book in that series to be released I decided to try the Highland Warrior series. I couldn't put this, or any of the books in this series down! I didn't read this series in the exact order, but they all stand alone so it wasn't a problem. All I can say is READ THIS BOOK!!! You will be hooked before you know it :-D"
3,A Scottish Fling!,"The first book by this author relating to time travel in the 1500's and Scotland. Having read some of her more recent work I did find this one lacking in its story line. This is an excellent first work and I think if I had read it first, I would have loved it! Nicely paced, romantic, and a real plus if you love the concept of time travel. All the highland books by this author are related, so read this one first and you will follow the flow in the rest much easier."
1,"So cheesy, so... typical, so...","I couldn't even convince myself to end it, it was that bad. This book is about a pefect guy who doesn't love any woman but has sex with dozens of them and enjoys being a womanizer. And then there's the young woman of the book, who is so beautiful and so all perfect as he is, and she has vowed never to let herself fall in love again with a perfect man because the last time she did it turned out awful.So, two characters who aren't interested about falling in love or in settling down, but then, when they see each other... only upon seeing each other, they hadn't talk by that moment, is all hotness and need and I-don't-know-why-but-I-want-him/her. Then, they talk some more, they argue, he tries to woo her, and she says no, but they are still in the I'm saying no, but I-don't-know-why-but-I-want-him/her.So I suppose these two end together, but I didn't like the book and didn't get on reading. I have another book of this author, I expect it to be better."
5,Great start to a series!,"After reading Moning's Fever series, I have no idea why I wasn't expecting this level of awesomeness. I loved the plot, characters, everything. I do wish Adrienne had been a little more open and little less poor-me, but it worked with the storyline, so I'll let it pass."
2,Who are these people?,"This book had high ratings from many reviewers, but I'm not sure why. I can suspend belief for the gods/fae toying with the human hero, but at least the characters need to be believable and their motivations comprehensible. Adrienne seems positively blasé about being dropped in the 16th century, actually prefers it to 1997 because there is no traffic noise. Hawk and Adrienne have barely met and they're madly in love, in spite of her distrust of men and his vast experience of women. Most of the conflict arises from Adrienne refusing to admit she desires Hawk. Overall we never get to know or care about the characters at all. There is essentially no realistic context (sights, smells, activities) to ground the action in 1513, and even the 1990's back story is unrealistic (were there orphanages in New Orleans in the 90's?)."
1,A mess of a story,"The author, I'm afraid, tried to put in too much in one book. Time-traveling fugitive abused heroine meets oversexed rakehell man, both perfect humans with no physical flaws. Then there are faeries and lame court intrigue, a quest towards the end, and I'm sure there's a kitchen sink buried in the story... somewhere.Also, the writing is overflowery, with lips, tresses, torsos, bosoms, and er, love organs described in melodramatic purple prose that had me cringing.At last count, there are 6 misunderstandings.I don't have patience for these sort of books, really. Here's hoping 'To Tame A Highland Warrior' is better."
5,A captivating book !,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Even though I found the beginning to be a bit slow, the pace did pick up and I was so happy that I ""stuck"" with it. By the middle of the book, I was completely hooked !I especially enjoyed the character of Adrienne's relationship with her mother-in-law. I, myself, am blessed with a mother-in-law who is the 'mother I always wanted', so this particular character direction truly touched my heart. I also found myself dreamily imagining that love *can* cross all bounds of time and space.The fairy aspect was a bit harder to believe for me than the time travel aspect, but it didn't detract from this being an enjoyable book. I was a bit worried it be too 'science fiction' for me, but this book was truly a romantic adventure.This was the first book by Karen Marie Moning I'd read but I've ordered the rest of her books in this series because I had so much fun with this one !"
2,disappointing....,"I actually bought this book based on the recommendations on Amazon and I was really disappointed when I finally got to read it. This is Ms. Moning's book and I think she should have spent more time editing it. Although her plot was certainly intruiging, I found her story to be choppy and incoherent at times. Like for example, Adrienne's life in the future was spotty at best, and I wish Ms. Moning spent more time developing Adrienne's background.This book is also not nearly as humorous as her other books. The author certainly tries to be amusing in her dialogue, but it just seems forced rather than clever and lighthearted like in her other books.But don't let this book turn you off from the wonder of Karen Marie Moning's writing. Her other 4 books are absolutely superb, all in the top 20 of my favorite books ever. I especially loved Kiss of the Highlander and its sequel the Drak Higlander is a close second. I highly recommend buying her other books; they're really worth your money."
2,couldn't suspend disbelief,"Okay, I liked the idea of this book. I even liked the idea of the wounded heroine who had to relearn trust. But I found it annoying that the author repeated the ""almost together...no wait...go away"" scene several times more often than necessary. And I also found it grating that the hero was consistently referred to as ""the Hawk."" Like ""the statue"" or ""the giant."" I mean, what mother calls her son ""the Hawk?!"" And some of the language was jarring and out of place...e.g. ""enormous cock."" I just couldn't get over that one! I did like some of the conversations between Hawk and Adam though...nice writing there. All in all, this book was a disappointment. I'd read the great reviews, and bought it because of a personal recommendation. But I'll sell it to a used book store with no qualms. It was a frustrating read."
5,favorite of all time,"This book is the best book I've ever read. I've read it 30 times and it never gets old. The characters were so wonderful together and completely frustrating at the same time. There is something so spellbinding about a man no woman can capture and a woman no man can suduce being thrown together and finding true love. Adrienne and the Hawk were so fiercely devoted to one another, everyone dreams of a love like that.I also love the mythical aspects like a feary Queen and her fool who caused the Hawk so much grief. I laughed and cried from the beginning to the end of this book and I don't think I'll ever grow tired of it. Don't pass this book up or you'll be sorry."
2,Typical hokey romance,"I saw folks recommend this after reading Outlander by Diana Gabaldon - yuk- don't bother, not even in the same league as Outlander - I won't even finish this silly thing its that bad.if you really feel inclined - get it from the library - don't buy it!"
5,Groovy Reading!,"This is such excellent reading I felt compelled to write a review. She has written a super book with a groovy plot and engaging characters. I also loved some of the secondary bods, especially Adam! Cannot wait to read more of this talented lady!"
1,so lame!,"This is probably the 30th highlander novel I have read. EVERY SINGLE ONE of the others I have read are better than this one. The characters are boring. There is no history involved. The girl travels back in time, no big deal, to find a man who wants her. Whole book is him offering to have sex with her, her saying no. Finally they do it, then they're in love. end of stoy. No plot."
5,Wonderful book,"It's not too often that there is a book that I just can't put down. I read this book from cover to cover in just two days. While in the store, I was just looking for something a little different because I was tired of my old style of romances. I'm now getting book 2 and 3 because they are just wonderful. I can't wait to get them so I can read them too. I could only imagine the confusion when going back and forth from the past to the future and back again.I especially cried when Hawk destroyed the nursery that he had so lovingly built. Again a great read from someone who is just looking for some entertainment."
1,horrible,I really hated this book. I bought it based on several good recommendations and can't remember the last time I was so disapointed. The characters are flat and you don't understand why any of them are doing anything that they do. Ms. Moning never fleshes them out through their actions. She says they are great and noble and witty and super special but she NEVER shows any of this through word or deed. The heroine hates the hero for a silly reason and then is cruel to him and then she decides she loves him for no reason. These clowns do not have one romantic or interesting conversation in the entire book. And why do I have to read about man parts that a stallion would envy? Eww. My husband kept telling me to stop reading it but I hate to leave things unfinished. These are a few hours of my life that I wish I could have back.
3,Very Slow to Get Started,"I think if I had skipped the first 3/4 of this book I would have loved it. You have to get beyond Adrienne's annoying and nasty character and the problem of why Hawk loves her almost at first sight even though he has bedded many more beautiful women. Adrienne was so mean to Hawk that I was hoping the poison or the arrow would actually kill her. Aside from that the last few chapters were great and the love making when it occurred near the end was also terrific. If you like the Highlander series, you should read this, but I would not recommend it as a first read in the series or you might not want to continue."
3,1 was enough,"I just read this book on my Kindle (via a library loan)....Glad I didnt make the purchase. I love Moning's Fever Series. So, I decided to read the Highlander books. But---this book is just plain corny! The plot & characters are best suited to a 13-year-old, but with the sex scenes maybe not. I'm 32 and found this book way beneath my reading level, and my cognitive level. Sorry, Moning....your Fever books are still awesome."
1,No text to speech option,No text to speech option for this title. Disabled by the publisher. I will not be getting anymore from this publisher.
4,Fun Read!,"Karen Moning does it again with Beyond the Highland Mist. I read the ""Fever"" series first and thoroughly enjoyed all of them. I will not read the Highlander series. Karen is a good story teller."
2,Tacky Romance Novel,If you have read the Outlander series by Dianna Gabaldon you will be quite disappointed. This book was placed under the historical fiction category. It is more romantic fiction than historical. That is not my style of reading material.
2,No way two characters could really be this stupid,"By the time I got to the middle of this book I wanted to screech with agitation, frustration and impatience. NO ONE could be as stupid and misbegotten as these two people. The silly assumptions and mis-communications ruined what could have been a really good story line. I know Ms. Moning has to be a better writer than this. I assume she is trying to stay true to the romance formula but really this took it too far. How can people who read these books be satisfied with the same plot over and over again.I ran out of other fantasy paranormal books so I turned to this one. Unfortunately, it fell too close to my read of Echo in the Bone by Diana Gabaldon and that's like comparing Stephen Hawking to a first grade primer.I'm going to try and remember that frutration the next time I'm tempted to read a romance again. I gave it two stars because it had a good idea for the story. I'm just sorry she couldn't flesh it out better."
5,For lovers of time travel and romance!!,"I love time travel romance books so this novel was on my to read shelf for a while. After loving the Outlander series and the time traveler's wife book I was hesitant to read this book. However, I really enjoyed this read! It was well worth it! The story was engaging and riveting. I really like Moning's writing style. The ending did not dissapoint! I'm so excited to read more from this series! If you love time travel romance books than this book is for you!"
3,"Don't compare to 'Outlander,' this stands on its own...","This series is awesome!! I went into this series after reading all the reviews like 'don't read this if you love Outlander!'... well that's just silly. You shouldn't go into any Hinglander series expecting Outlander, it's like going into a book about wizards expecting 'Harry Potter.'That being said, I love this series. I had a few issues with the first 2 books, but the 3rd and 4th sold me and I'm hooked. Give it a chance and don't expect the epic-ness of Outlander, expect fun and fairytale like love... that's why we read this stuf isn't it??"
5,Carly in the CD player,We keep a Carly Simon CD in the car changer all the time and it was time for a new one. Coming Around Again has her usual distinctive style and rhythm; delighted with the oldie. As Time Goes By.
5,Yummy,"A delicious blend of Carly's amazing voice and rich imagery. From the hauntingly sad ""Coming Around Again"" to the sparkling ""Two Hot Girls (On A Hot Summer Night)""...""like crystal and pennies..."", this album is a beautiful lyrical and musical achievement. Carly glows! Includes the beautiful, classic ""As Time Goes By"" ~ joyous celebration of resilient love and time honored romance. Rich with emotional honesty about the complexities of vulnerability and hope as well as disappointment and hurt. Eloquently balanced. Highly, highly recommended."
5,Oldie but goodie,"I just read the book ""Girls Like Us"" about Corole King, Joni Mitchell and Carly Simon. I had the LP of ""Coming Around Again"" and realized that I would likt to own it again. I love the song ""Coming Around again"" and ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"" and also b/c they remind me of a great movie and book, ""Heartburn"" This album was considered a comeback album for her. Some of us think that she never went away."
5,"Old CD, but still the best","I'm a Carly fan and have heard most of her stuff. This CD is by far the best ever. The songs are all about life and real people, and ""Do the Walls Come Down"" has got to be the sexiest song of all. Try it, you'll be pleasantly surprised."
5,Whitney Houston- Whitney,"Objectively, Whitney Houston's second album went 9x platinum, became the first by a female artist to debut at No. 1 on Billboard 200, had 4 singles that went No. 1 on Billboard Hot 100: ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me), ""Didn't We Almost Have It All,"" ""So Emotional,"" and ""Where Do Broken Hearts Go,"" was nominated for Album of The Year, had 3 other singles: ""Love Will Save the Day,"" ""I Know Him So Well,"" and ""You're Still My Man,"" and topped foreign charts including Swedish, Norwegian, and French. Every song on ""Whitney"" is worth the listen as Houston displayed her now former magnificent vocal abilities. There aren't any fillers on the CD. ""Just the Lonely Talking Again"" deserved to be another single. ""Where You Are"" talks about constantly thinking about a significant other. ""Love is a Contact Sport"" is an upbeat track. The remake of ""For the Love of You"" was done well."
4,Another Whitney Cd With Songs Not on Her Greastest CD,"I am glad I purchase this cd along with ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"" cd. With the Amazon discount, the listen to the cd sounds even better. There are few songs that I forget she made or didn't recall ever hearing her sing these songs."
3,Nice offering and great vocal range,"Whitney sounds like she is having fun here and the voice range is there, she lets loose and grew in confidence with this album."
1,Sophomore Slump Hits Hard,"The photo, the glamour, the glitz, the hype- but Where is the voice? This CD is full of cookie-cutter ballads and posturing up-tempo tracks. Whitney DAZZLED us with ""Saving All My Love For You"". Then she threw her talent away on this CD- except for the bright ear candy of ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"" and the smooth ""Just the Lonely Talkin' Again"". Whitney has it all. Looks, talent and enough money to hire some great producer who will just LET HER SING. My suggestion for producers with an ear for the artist of this type: Phil Ramone : he does wonders for Streisand or, yes, Richard Carpenter: the music was subtle and classy, but he let Karen's voice ""sell"" the song. If these choices don't work for you, Whitney, run back to David Foster!"
5,A worthy chart topper.,"Whitney Houston's second album broke all sorts of records back in the day and with good reasons, her unique one-of-a kind voice combined with top notch production. On the downside if you never cared for bordering-on-pop R&B Music this won't make you a fan. Detractors aside, ""Whitney"" is outstanding through-and-through.The big hits ""I wanna dance with somebody"", ""So emotional"", ""Where do broken hearts go"", ""Love will save the day"", and ""Didn't we almost have it all"" are highly enjoyable. There's also a few lesser known gems here as well. ""Just the lonely talking again"" is a semi-ballad with an incessant chorus. ""Love is a contact sport"" with it's catchy main section and driving chorus is vastly overlooked. ""I know him so well"", A fine duet with Cissy Houston (Whitney's mother) surprisingly wasn't released as a single, that's a shame, as given Whitney's status back then it would've soared up the charts."
5,80's Classic!,"This was one of Whitney's best albums.. The album had several 80s hits and on the cd you get the original version of ""I Wanna Dance With Someone"" rather than a dance remix. Great album!! Love it!!"
4,Guilty pleasures,"Whitney pretty much kept to her formula for her sophomore effort--but this time a lot more pop than R&B. The #1 hit ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody"" is actually my least favorite song on the album. I couldn't stand that song when it was on the radio. It didn't make me want to dance at all. The #1 hit ""Didn't We Almost Have It All"" didn't really register with me, either. Those two bummers aside... this album is surprisingly great. Another reviewer once said these songs were ""So bad they're good"" and in a way he's right. Her shock-and-awe vocals make mediocore songs sound so amazing you'll be repeating them over and over. ""So Emotional"" is a great example of that. ""Love Is A Contact Sport"", ""Where Do Broken Hearts Go"", ""Love Will Save The Day"" and ""You're Still My Man"" are all highlights. I love almost all the songs from her 2nd album. I highly reccomend this if you enjoyed the radio hits. You won't encounter any fillers on this one."
5,Her best album to date joint.,"What an album not one bad track on it, it contains her usual style of uptempo dance songs and her busting ballads including her greatest duet to date ""I Know Him So Well"" with her mother (Cissy Houston).It contains 3 of her nine consequetive number ones which include one of her best Dance songs ever ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody""(who Loves Me) and two of her best ballads too date ""where do broken Hearts go"" and Didn't We Almost Have It All"". This albums proves there is no barriers in music for Ms Houston. What makes this album so good is the fact that not only are her singles good but so are the non released tracks including the brilliant ""You're Still My Man"" 3 cheers for Whitney on this album."
2,Not as fun as the other Nancy Drew games...,I love the Nancy Drew game series for its ability to creep me out and make me scared to sleep in my room alone. However I found this particular game lacking. The mystery wasn't as interesting and was more 'find object 1 to unlock object 2' than the usual sleuthing and sneaking that you do in this series. I didn't feel the adrenaline rush that I did with the other games. I would recommend this game if this is you're first Nancy Drew game. Otherwise I would skip it.
3,Eh....,"This game was not one of HERinteractive's best. It was way too short (I solved it in about 6 hours), the puzzles were way too easy and the story line was okay. And, I'm not the only one who thinks this either. My friend and her two brothers have the same exact opinion.Oh, and I just wanted to comment on Katie ""bookworm""'s review. The graphics in LTBMC were good, but they were no where near as good as MYST. I've played MYST for years, and the graphics are TONS better than the Nancy Drew games, so don't think that they are the same."
3,"Entrancing graphics, Dull plot and characters","The graphics in all of the Nancy Drew games keep getting more realistic and fine-tuned. However, I find when there are more characters, they have less personality. Also, Nancy Drew has been invited on this mystery with Frank and George, but she didn't stumble upon it. This made the plot rather dull. It wasn't much of a mystery, but this treasure hunt was more of an adventure. The clues were incredibly simple to figure out, and there even more unanswered questions in this game. If you are the type of person who always has to use wlakthroughs because you get stuck, and enjoys basic characters, then this is the game for you."
5,Best one yet!,"I have played 11 out of the 13 Nancy Drew games and I believe this one is the best. Great storyline, amazing graphics, good characters(I loved it when Joe imitated Tino!) and great ending, even if it was a bit easy to figure out. Overall, a great game. If you are trying to decide whether or not to buy it, trust me, you won't be disappointed. I would pay $35 for this gem!"
5,Major Improvement over Last Game,"I was skeptical about buying this game.I have been let down by the last couple of releases.I was very suprised how good the storyline was.Addition of the Hardy Boys was a good idea.I hope they include a ND HB release every year.I felt the game length was just right.The Last game was to short and easy.The puzzles are not as hard as Scarlet Hand,and not easy like The last few games.Its about time Herinteractive started listening to their costumers..Great voice acting,and graphics as well.."
5,Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon,"You, as Nancy Drew, embark on a journey to discover where Jake Hurley's lost mine is. On the train, who Lori Girard's (a very rich and, uh, doesn't have a lot upstairs girl) father owns, you are accompanied with John Grey, an actor on the TV show, Ghost Hunters; Tino Balducci, a ""#1"" cop who just happened to be in the right place at the right time when he nabbed those criminals; Charleena Purcell, who writes romance novels; and the legendary HARDY BOYS!!Throughout the course of the mystery, you solve many puzzles. Most are easy. Then, you wait until you get to your destination: Copper Gourge. This is where Jake Hurley, the man who originally owned the train now owned by Lori's father, buried his wife, Camille, who died on the train while the couple were heading to Jake's lost mine.I recommend this Nancy Drew game, and any of the other 13 Nancy Drew mysteries, to all!"
5,Awsome!!!,"This is my favorite Nancy Drew game of all! It's long but not to long, with the right amount of action and puzzles to never make you want to git off. there are patches & tricks to make it work on XP. I would suggest this game in a heartbeat."
4,A lot of fun,I liked this game. This was different than the other Nancy Drew games. I think it's worth playing.
4,nancy drew computer games,"""The Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon"" and every Nancy Drew game in this series (aside from the very first one)....has been so enjoyable for my daughter and me! I grew up a Nancy Drew book fan, and my daughter has read all the books. Now, we are fans of the computer games. We have not only had fun playing these games, but we have also learned alot in a variety of subject areas; from historical Mayan facts to logic puzzles. It's been so much fun! We collect the Nancy Drew games and we can't wait for the next one (Danger By Design) to come out! Thanks for the fun ride, Her Interactive!."
5,Another great Nancy Drew game,"I just finished solving this game, and it's definitely worth your time and money. It's longer than Secret of the Old Clock, though not as long as Curse of Blackmoor Manor. Similar to Secret of Shadow Ranch, I'd say. (These are some other Nancy Drew computer games, for those who may be unfamiliar with the titles.) There are lots of puzzles, but they're not too difficult. The graphics are good, as is the ending sequence. I can't really think of a complaint, except that perhaps it could have been scarier. Looking forward to the next one!"
5,A Fun Game for ALL Ages,"The Nancy Drew series computer games first started when I was about 12. Since then, I have purchased each new one as they come out. I am now 20 and I still enjoy playing these games just as much. I think many people feel that these games are targeted toward girls in their early teens but don't be fooled - these games are not easy! Nonetheless, they are very enjoyable to play - when I was younger me and friend would work on the games together. If you are looking for a quality computer game that requires you to think and doesn't involve blood and gore and lots of violence, I'd recommend any of the games from the Nancy Drew series!"
5,Loved it!,"I've always loved her games, this one was amazing! Different places to go to, lots of clues and mini games!Perfect score!! BTW, I am Micah's wife, so he won't feel bad."
1,Awful!,"This game took hours to download. Installation was very slow too. Whenever you are in part of this game where there is dialogue (which is almost constant), you cannot access the menu or exit by any way. You are just stuck listening to lame conversations which you are forced to take part in. Played this for about 30 minutes and found very little to actually do but navigate around the train. This was our first and last Nancy Drew. BORING!"
2,Great graphics but doll puzzle will not work,"The graphics are great. But we had to go online and find the game guide. But even using the game guide and watching the youtube video on this puzzle, the doll puzzle will not let us proceed. Our doll line up matches the youtube but it does not progress any further to let us open the drawer we need to proceed. Starting to be not so great a Christmas present for my granddaughter. If anyoneelse has run into this problem, we could use some guidance. At this time, I would not suggest this as a fun game to do together due to frustration..."
5,another swell addition to the series,"HerInteractive has banged out another fun mystery. We get to ""meet"" the Hardy Boys in this one, hopefully they'll be back for more. I didn't come across any errors or bugs in the game, yay. I played on Windows XP with SP2 installed. Gameplay is pretty much the same as the rest of the series although Blue Moon was certainly beefed up a bit from Old Clock. It's a bit lengthier but still left me wanting more. Graphics were great. One thing that definitely makes all the Nancy Drew games great is that you don't have to find or accomplish everything in one particular order. I'd like to see HerInteractive make the games a bit more challenging in terms of the trivia the player has to read, like integrate more of the knowledge into the game. Now that the game company has hammered out the gameplay logistics, it's time for them to challenge themselves to create a more cutting edge game."
4,Great!,"Although its not my favorite it was still very exciting! I love these games so much, and so do my older sister (18) and younger (12). Although im the fanatic =). The only problem i had with this one was it got very irritating going back and forth through the train, most of the other games have more places to go...this one was for the most part the train. But the story plot was so cool and interesting it kept me going so i could find out more! So many turns and twists it will have you guessing until the very end!"
4,A pretty good ND game; definately not the best,"Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon is a pretty good Nancy Drew game. I was expecting it to be a lot longer, but it only took me about 3 days.The puzzles were challenging enough, and there were some really cool ones, but it would've been cooler if there were more.I would have to say the best part of LTBMC is the characters. Lots of characters make a game better. The characters had incredible animation, and were very well developed.I think that the the scenery was also a highlight of the game. Being on a train was really fun, even though after a while I was eager to get off! Overall, I'd give Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon 4 stars, and I do recommend buying it."
4,Working with the Hardy Boys didn't add much to the game,"Like all the ND games, this one had enough to keep me thinking. The puzzles are always fun but sometimes finding '10 little' gems can be very frustrating and I feel stuck until they are found. This game included appearances by the Hardy Boys, but they really didn't add any value to the game play by sitting in the dining car. They provided more help in other games when available by calling them for ideas and information. If there was a way to 'change into' Frank or Joe at certain points and explore as one of them for a while it might have been fun.Overall another solid ND game."
4,"Not My Favorite, But Good","I happen to be a die hard Nancy Drew fan and I have a lot of their games. This one was one of my favorites. I loved the new cell phone idea and that you can take pictures. The story line is good and there are some definite plot twists. I won't give anything away, but the whole kidnapping and finding sequence is great! I loved how that turned out! Well, the ending is ok, i guess. It wasn't as scary and high energy as some of them. I recommend Secret of Shadow Ranch. It's got a majorly suspensful ending and it's kind of a new expierence in the Nancy Drew games. But overall, this game gets 4 stars. It's definitly worth buying. I think this is good more for teenagers, but its good for adults too. The puzzles are definitly challenging and i noticed that in this one, there are a lot more puzzles than usual. Enjoy!"
4,Unfinished Business,"This movie was extremely interesting and made a ""hidden"" part of our country's history quite understandable to middle school students. All of my students kept asking ""But what about the first amendment?"" ""What about the 5th or 6th amendment?"" Is this legal to do to American citizens? I was so pleased that the students were able to make the connection between what we have learned in class and real life situations."
3,Its OK...,"Don't expect too much...but no doubt about it, the topic is very interesting...it's just that the tempo and rhythm of the doc is not that catching. Wish it were really.But don't regret buying it. Simply learning about American concentration camps is something that definitely needs the same attention than all those Nazi story's that directors keep reminding us about...How can we be so fanatic and paranoid as human beings?"
4,"Good, but....","Of the 6 sets that were released I tend to watch Bizarre Murders the most. However, like a lot of fans I was extremely disappointed at the way Cosgrove and Meuer decided to release the show on DVD. If Unsolved Mysteries hadn't been such a fantastic show, I would understand cutting down a lot of material into these segmented box sets. I watched the show from beginning to end and always hoped (even before the onset of TV DVD box sets) that somehow I could own every episode ever made. I thought it would've been crazy to try and tape every single episode when it went into syndication on Lifetime but now I'm kicking myself for not doing just that. The creators could've done a much better job at choosing what to include in the sets. For someone with a mild interest in the show I'm sure the sets we were fortunate enough to have will do just fine. But for the serious fan like myself it'll leave you very frustrated."
2,Missing special features and box in picture is wrong,"I read Jonathan T's review and realized that this product has changed from what it was originally. The picture displayed is not what you are sent. Now being a 2 disc set, the box is much thinner. The box we received mentions special features, but we can't find them on the two discs provided. My daughter's enjoyed the episodes provided, but wished there was more and were expecting the special features described on the box. Note on the product details it lists the run time as ""98 minutes"" but the editorial reviews is comprised of a single statement that it's runtime is ""179 minutes""."
2,"Barely useful collection,not a guide.","This ""book"" is mostly a collection of unrelated chapters each by a different person with a modest telescope.Very little advice or"" how to do it"" in this book.Save your money."
1,Not what it say's on the tin.,"Another collection essays by a number of people that purports to be ""by"" Stephen Tonkin. ""Edited by"", and inexpertly at that, would be more accurate. Please don't buy this book."
1,A bummer,"When I received this mat, I agreed with other reviews here. It was beautiful, the perfect size and color, and looked well made. Two short weeks later, the rubber has started to blister and peel. It looks a mess. And we have not even had any harsh weather. What a disappointment.I have contacted Lewis Hyman, and will update if they back up the product."
1,Mindless is right.,Another good example proving that anyone can publish a book. Completely humorless.
3,Functional but a bit disappointing,"The lamps are sturdy and work well and I didn't find anything better in a week-long internet search or in local shopping. Still, they are a bit disappointing.I ordered these lamps because I liked the style of the base even though I didn't want white shades. I confirmed via e-mail that the lamps all had harps but when they arrived, I found only the floor lamp did. The replacement shades I'd purchased required harps so I had to buy harps and rebuild the lamps. Strangely, one of the lamps came apart quiet easily and another was very hard to disassemble.I was also disappointed that the floor lamp is shorter than I expected. Perhaps not shorter than specified -- I haven't measured -- but shorter than expected. Finally, the description says ""bronze"" but I'd say the lamps are closer to chocolate brown."
1,Very disappointing,"After reading the blurb and seeing this called and intelligent and sensitive book, I was really looking forward to reading it. I liked the plot and the setting, but the execution was simply horrible. Point of view shifts happened from paragraph to paragraph. The main character was lifeless and dull. There were long passages detailing emotions (sensitive?) but then the plot would be summed up in two or three sentences. It was telling instead of showing at its worst."
3,Is this the outline?,"I felt as though this was the outline for the book, and the author forgot to fill in the details. The whole story is *told*, not *shown*, and there is a huge difference in those approaches. There's no characterization--I had no sense of the main character as a person. Though horrible things happened to her, things also happened much too easily for her. Time passed, she gained powers, she went to the head of the class, talked to a few gods, and everyone loved her. Time to go reclaim the kingdom. I guess I'll pick up the second volume to see how she does it, but I'll check the secondhand store before ordering it full price."
