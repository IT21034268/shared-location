5,A great set of ear buds at a good price!,"For personal use, these are as good as any I have tried. I selected these after reading some of the other reviews and have not regreted it. Thanks Amazon and all the other reviewers."
4,Sennheiser CX300 Earbuds,"These earbuds have good sound quality for the price. The bass is a little loose and can stand to be a little less distorted. This was improved by adjusting the equalizer on my iPod. If you are tall (over 6 feet) then there may be some problems wearing an iPod on your waist as the cord on these earbuds is kind of short. It can be done, but there isn't much slack left over. Overall these earbuds appear to be a quality product."
3,I'm with negatives.,"I've just bought the headphones and as many here, have had high expectations. Well, what can I say - first of all you do have to insert them deep inside your ear canal as was mentioned in several reviews - otherwise you don't have any bass at all. Like NO BASS. But the moment you insert them deep in your ear - yes, the negative reviews state it absolutely honest and clear - your every motion transmits the sound of the wires scratching right into your ear amplified... I can't say it's a _very_ big issue, but it's an issue nevertheless. It is very audible.But even if you've done everything right - and are not moving... Well, I'd say the bass is still a bit too thin. The sound of the phones is not cheap. It is ok... But street-styled PMX60 are better, imho. And cheaper, by the way. Overall... I got the phones for less than 30$ and I'm satisfied. But I would not buy them for more. And I'm not sure, if I'd buy them for 30$ if I knew everything before."
2,"Sound is ""buzzy"", but tolerable","The buds fit well and do block out noise. However, it seems that some of the blocking is due to a persistent buzz (or hum) in the background. I didn't use the earbuds for quite some time so too late to return. I tried them on a desktop, laptop and MP3 player. The least buzz was with the MP3 on a plane.Would not buy again, but maybe I just got a lemon. They come with different size earbuds so you get a good fit."
3,Sennheiser CX 300B In-ear Monitor,not as great as I had hoped as there is a big issue for me with the closed ear and how that amplifies jaw clicking and also how sounds travel up the wires in much the way the old soap can and string telephones worked.
1,Avoid these,"Just received these as my first pair of earbuds , replacing the old style speaker-in-the-ear phones . These just don't cut it at all, no bass whatsoever and are tinny at best . Very comfortable and fit nicely but the loss of sound , 3_d and stereo perception are really non-existant. may try the $100 stuff but this fails so miserably I may stick to the old style earphones or even proper headphones .Life is too short to listen to good music this way, the sacrifice does not do music justice .Sledge"
2,Sennheiser to much base,"I also so the good review in PC magazine. I was very disappointed. The music is not that clear, and the base takes over. I have had several different pairs of earbuds, and this pair really does rank near the bottom. I listen to music everyday on my Zen Microphoto MP3."
2,Deceptive value,"These seemed like very good value when I first bought them. But although they're still under warranty (three months into the two-year warranty period) I won't be going back for my fourth replacement. They seem to last for about three weeks of moderate use before the left channel dies, no matter how carefully they're looked after.If they were more robust I'd recommend them as a decently priced and decently performing replacement for iPod standard buds, but they're disappointingly ephemeral."
5,Wonderful!,Great sound... search eBay and you can find them new for around $25.00 S/h included. Regarding the left/right size difference... you are supposed to wrap the longer (right) cord behind your neck to the right ear. This allows it to hang on your neck when you take the ear-buds out of your ears.
4,Great for the $,"The Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds are an excellent choice for the money. Just couldn't see spending $300 plus for other highly-rated headphones. The sound quality is good, and they're way more comfortable than the earbuds that come with an iPOD. They blocked out noise well when I used them on a recent flight, and you don't have to mess around with batteries. Not wild about the strain relief design - one side is longer than the other and goes around behind your neck to your ear - but that is a minor point."
5,Great earbuds,"I bought these after reading a magazine review on them. They were touted to be some of the best earbuds you could get for the money. I have to say that I agree 100%. They actually do a great job of reproducing bass, in spite of their small size. They are also very effective at noise cancellation, since you push them pretty far into your ear canal. I've really enjoyed them, and have thought of buying another pair for my wife too."
4,Whew! Almost shelled out for the Ultimate Ears!!,"I'd been waffling whether to get the Ultimate Ears super.fi 3 Pro's, or the 5 Pro's. I'd listened to a pair of UE 3's a friend of mine had picked up and thought I might like the UE 5's since they supposedly have more extended bass. Luckily, I wavered long enough for these cx300's to come out. Man, am I glad I waited!!I'm not gonna snow you and tell you they'll replace my Senn 595's....but they'll get more than their fair share of usage. I've had these 2 weeks now and I'm continually amazed at the sound. Although, at times I think the bass is just a tad much, the cx300 is smoother across the frequency range than I anticipated. And, they amply block out the server stacks (and the boss!) that I sit next to at work.I whole-heartedly recommend these!"
4,Worth buying,"I just got these for christmas and have been using them everyday. I like them because earbuds would never ever stay in my ear. These in ear headphones finally stay in my ear even while performing my sport.Sound is good for in ear heaphones, but obviously not as good as my favorite Sennheiser HD202 which are amazing if you love a rich base, but these are the first in ear headphones I ever tried, so I don't really know how the sound compares to others (Just over the ears).Cons: The right cord is longer than the left and that's why the left one tends to fall out easy because it has to carry all the load.conclusion: for a little under $30 this is a good buy"
4,Better than Shure E2c,I own these and the Shure E2 and these are way better. The bass is 10 times louder and deeper than the Shures. These have way more range and are more comfortable. At first I didn't like these but I realized you really have to shove them in your ear. It feels a little penetrating but after a while it feels good:)My only real complaint is that the cord length is WAY to short. I have to buy an extension and that may impact the sound. The wire is also really thin and it is loud when rubbing against your clothes (or skin).
4,Nice Earphones,"Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds Its a great option, great sound, good bass (not great), nice design. Another good option to buy its aV-MODA Bass Freq Earbuds - Platinum White, I buy one for my girlfreind (design for womens...).Stop thinking, buyit!! Sennheiser are the best no professional phones."
4,"Sound Great, Good Bass","These headphones sound great. They have good, strong bass & everything sounds clean. They block out noise pretty good, but not as good as the high-dollar active noise-canceling headphones (but, that's to be expected).On my set, if there is any pressure on the plug, I get static. It usually only happens when I'm adjusting/moving my mp3 player, so it's not a big problem.Counterfeits of these & other headphones are rampant on the web. The reviews from people complaining about sound quality & other things probably got some of these. Order directly from Amazon or one of their highly-regarded sellers & you shouldn't have any problems."
5,About These headset,"When i first bought these I bought one for my brother but then my dad liked them so much he bought himself a pair and then so did my other brother! These headset are deffinatley worth the price and give such a good time in the plane,metro,car etc... The nosie cancelling is amazing thinking you dont need extra batterieys or anything.There small a sweet.These are a good buy!"
3,"Decent, but not a steal at this price","I bought a pair of these to replace my aging Apple in-ear headphones (which wouldn't stay in my ears but they were sturdy) and when they arrived, I thought they were knockoffs. The construction is cheap and I'll be impressed if this pin-thin cord lasts more than six months. The sound is decent but not that impressive. The most annoying part is the way the cord hangs from the one ear down and over with the dangling bit leading to the other ear just sort of floating around instead of falling against your chest since it there's no weight to the cheap cord. Disappointing but not terrible."
3,"Move along, nothing to see here...","I bought these the same time my girlfriend bought her Bose ear-buds. She paid $40 more for hers. What a sucker! I'm talking about me, not her. Do yourself the favor and spend the extra $40.The mids and highs are pretty nice, but the CX300's do not offer a good bass sound. Perhaps the CX300-B's are nicer in that area.Just remember, you get what you pay for."
1,Didn't like it,"I had never tried this type of headphone before. I didn't like it. When I walked every foot step was very loud. They seal your ears and they don't breathe. The sound was typical of normal in ear headphones, for me they all have a lack of bass compared to normal headphones, or home stereos. I have other Sennheiser headphones, so that's why I bought another pair, but they didn't work out for me."
1,Very disappointed and I returned them,"I wanted to get something better than the standard earphones for my Ipod.I saw some good reviews and this brand has been known always for great headphones. Bought these and was shocked at the terrible sound quality. Yes, the sound is clean, but TOO clean. The highs are too high leading to tinny and over-brassy sound. Voices have too much hiss. There is virtually no low end bass of any type. Very disappointing."
2,4 pairs in a row died on me in months,"[update] I've now had FOUR sets in a row and they have ALL had exactly the same problem. Thankfully there is a 2 year warranty and Sennheiser does replace them, but my warranty is almost up and I'm about to send my current set back again! Seriously, don't waste your time.[original review] I had these for about 3 months before the sounds went out in the left earphone. At first I liked them - the sound is good, but the earbuds are too big (even the smallest of the 3 sizes included) and so it's hard to get them to stay in my ears and the cords are tacky (as in sort of sticky) so they tangle extremely easily. I've just sent them back to Sennheiser (at my expense) to hopefully have them fixed as they're still under warranty."
2,disappointed,"I bought these expecting great sound, but they just didn't deliver. There was absolutely no bass whatsoever,, and I tried it on a partable Walkman CD player with a radio, a Mini Disc recorder an iPod and my home stereo, as well as even in my TV set, and they all just sounded bad. I will say they were very comfortable though, so if you don't care if there is no bass and the sound is kind of tinny, they are fine."
4,"Good sound, decent price.","Have no complaints about the quality of the sound delivered from my iPod. However, I do not understand the use of two different length wires to the ears. The longer one wants to kink up under your chin if you have the wires deployed down your chest instead of your back. Kind of annoying. But the sound is definitely an improvement over the iPods original equipment, and the sound isolation ear-buds do help filter out the background conversations of my socio-pathic office co-workers. That's added a few years to their collective lives."
3,Great sound at the cost of dependability,"I bought these to replace a pair of Sony MDR-ED21LP's that died on me after a year or so of usage.CX300 Pros-Sounds great-Gives good bass-Offers good sound isolationCX300 Cons-They breakI used these daily and have them wrapped around my mp3 player carried in my pocket. I also used them when I cycled. Be very gentle with them, otherwise try something else."
4,they sound nice,"After the exasperation of listening to my iPod with included headphones, these sound excellent. They have respectable bass response, and are pretty comfy as well.The only thing I really don't understand is the asymmetrical cord. What a stupid idea, but it doesn't matter. They sound good enough that I can disregard that."
5,Comfort and excellent sound quality,"Found the sound quality excellent and the headphones very comfortable after extended wear. Headphones did very well isolating outside noise during an 8 hour flight. The traditional ear bud headphones became uncomfortable after long use; however, the Sennheiser headphones felt great throughout the entire flight. Can't really say how they are during workouts or while running, but I use a different set of headphones for those activities."
3,"They are great buds, BUT","They have an asymmetrical cord. Meaning, one bud is actually a shorter cord length than the other. While some may find this a feature, after only a few hours of use the shorter bud would keep falling out with normal use.I suppose I could have run them behind my neck and down the back, but a good portion of my use was sitting at a desk with a iPod or PSP & every time I turned my head.. *doh!*"
5,Ditch your generic iPod earbuds for these now!,"First off, I am not much of an audiophile. Or at least I wasn't until now. My boss recommended these to me based on his experience with Sannheiser (not this particular model though). After playing around with the different size bud covers, I plugged them into my 30gb iPod and was amazed by the clarity. In songs I've heard for years, I heard new sounds and parts I never heard before (probably because my car speakers are blown out). Tiny details like the breathing between lyrics, tapping of the drums, and the picking of guitars, come alive in these earbuds.The bass isn't great unless you press them firmly against your ears, which I don't recommend to do. However I mostly listen to rock, so deep bass isn't something I really need anyway.And now I laugh when I see the masses walking around with their standard issue white iPod earbuds (I regularly visit NYC and I'm astounded at how many people use bad earbuds). Seriously, just get these earbuds."
4,noise canceling earbuds,"decent. don't block out as much noise or fit as tight as my old emotic research noise cancelers but then I'm not replacing the filters on those things every month either.the bose quiet comfort are the best I've had overall, with their white noise generation sound that help knock out background sound. they are comfortable too. but because they cover the ear, they get hot on the tred mill.for the money it was good purchase. [...]"
4,"Great sound, few complaints","I've been using the CX300s for about a week and my only complaints are the wire-brushing noise previously mentioned on other reviews, and the asymmetrical cord length. Otherwise, these rock for the price! I live in Chicago and commute to work on the El train and these babies keep out all train noise, people talking on their cell phones, etc. I definitely recommend these to anyone who hates the default Apple earbuds but doesn't want to spend over $100 for Shure."
3,Typical German sound,"The CX-300 earphones were a good improvement over the iPod stock ones but as most German products they sound ""techno"" and not at all musical.The brand name doesn't seem to matter, they sound ""clinical"" and fairly accurate but lack the necessary warmth."
1,Don't buy these earbuds,"These earbuds have the worst audio quality I have ever encountered. The highs were thin and tinny, the midrange was average, and the low end was non-existent. I followed Sennheiser's instructions/suggestions but nothing worked. I was past the date for returning the item, so in the end I gave them to a friend who wanted them. I replaced them with a $10 headset which has far superior quality."
1,These are simply awful,"I ordered these earbuds based on Amazon reviews and Sennheiser's reputation. They just arrived and aside from the fact that the cord was constructed so that one side was 6 inches longer than the other, the sound on these is hideous, It is tinny and distorts easily. These things sound like something you would get as a prize in a Cracker Jack box. This is the first time in years that a product I have purchased from Amazon is so totally different than the reviews describing it. Save your $50 and spend it on earbuds that work."
3,Not worth the $$ spents,"Okay, I was looking for some earphones that would at least fit my ears a little bit better than what came with my iPod...so that's why I chose to purchase te Senheiser's earbuds...not only that, but they were reviewed in my local paper as having some of the ""best sound quality"" available for the cost. The sound IS okay, however, occassionally there is static heard if the wires move just the right way, and I think for the price paid (somewhere around $53) I shouldn't hear a trace of static. The biggest disapointment with these earphones is that they did not come with a storage case, and they are not retractable. I take that back, the BIGGEST disappointment with this pair of earphones is that one side is much shorter than the other, and there is no way to adjust them. Stupid design! I would not recommend these earphones."
2,not as good as I'd hoped,"Based on the reviews, I was really hoping these earbuds would sound good, block out external noise, and fit really well. I was wrong on all counts. They were worthless for wearing while jogging, as they kept moving around inside my ear canal. I even tried the different size rubber tips to try to get them to fit better, but no luck. I found that they sound OK when sitting still, but the audio quality is best only when they're all the way in, touching the eardrum and that was tiring.So I put these in a drawer and went back to my Apple earbuds. The way they fit in the ear is better, and even though they don't sound great, at least they're consistent."
2,Where's the bass?,"I returned these earbuds after a few days as they certainly didn't live up to my expectations. The cons are pretty universal to all inexpensive earbuds but I expected more after reading the reviews. If this is what you can afford, then go ahead and buy them - just don't expect high end performance.PRO: ComfortableCON: Sounded like tin cans - no bass at all unless you press on them constantly; Sounds from cord touching anything are amplified"
1,APPLE IPOD NANO Owner,"I read the reviews and expected something awesome, but was completely dis-satisfied. I did not get a deep base sound using any of the ear adapters, the only real difference was the Treble. But since I like Bass, I'm returning them for a refund. I also switched between the EQ settings on the NANO and could not get a better overall sound from them. The sound difference just wasn't worth the $55 bucks. Also, the wiring is unbelievably cheap, unlike the IPOD cord which is a heavey duty gauge, cut even and hangs down without any effort, these are thin and were all curled up from shipping. Maybe it depnds on the shape of your ears, and the type of player you are using. If you buy them, make sure you get a return policy just incase."
1,I was sold fake stuff,I could not rate a real set of ear buds as the SOB sold me some fake ear buds. icursed him and sent them back at his expense.
1,Not Very Good,"I bought these based on a newspaper review, which tested various headphones. The reviewer found these to be of the best quality and sound for the money. Well the reviewer was wrong. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for these, based on sound criteria. Also, the buds do not fit the ears well with any of the 3 ""rubber"" adaptors provided. The adaptors are cheaply constructed and prone to pop off (I lost one the first day). As for sound, these make the iPod earbuds sound like Bose headphones. Don't waste your money."
3,Not for small ears,"I have small ears (I'm an adult, 140 lbs). Even with the smallest rubber nibs, these are difficult to get in. This is a personal concern, of course, but a warning for those of you who have smaller ears. They are not comfortable to get in. I have to push very hard, and because the rounded shape of the opposite end, you don't know if you are pushing the right way. The sound is great IF you can get them to fit, but I found the sony MD51s to fit my small ears better."
3,it didn't as good as I expected,I bought two pairs of this product. The quality of voice isn't bad but the connection has problem. I have to plug and unplug many times to make both sides work properly.
3,"Great sound, but don't loose a rubber piece!","Bought these a few months ago to add on another unit. I also use Sony 51's which I like alot and have served well for over a year now. The Sennheisers sound excellent. The cord tangles easy and there is a little rub noise when the cable is moved but I hardly notice it. Overall, I like these ALOT. The problem? I lost one of the little rubber tips. I emailed Sennheiser because I was unable to locate replacements. All they can sell me is the tips by the bag, 10 pieces per bag for $18! I guess I would probably need to add who knows what for shipping and maybe tax. Outrageous! I need one, not an expensive bag of ten! I have lost only one tip in almost two years of using this style earphones. I am supposed to spend half of what these cost to get a simple rubber tip replaced? I would think Sennheiser would be ashamed of this idea. They have lost a customer over what is probably a fifteen cent piece of rubber."
4,excellent sound,"These phones re-produce sound very well and remain faithful to high trebles and smooth bass. The idea of having one wire far longer than the other side is highly annoying. Indended to reach adolescents' lower pants' pockets, when normally used, hang down on one side of your neck and need to be wrapped. If you can get around this problem, the product does what it intends to do."
4,Good earbuds for the price.,"For the price, these are hard to beat.Sure there are better earbuds out there, but you will end up paying 2x - 3x (even 4x) times as much.From a Sansa 2gb mp3 player, these have good bass response (and I listen to a lot of bass-intensive beats), pretty clear highs, good fit (has replacable/customizale earbud pieces), good consturction (no wire sheathing problems yet)."
5,Great Sound,Great earbuds. Just be sure to use the right Silicone-Rubber Ear adapters.The best earbuds I had.
5,Happy all around,I'm highly satisfied with the quality of this earbuds. They fit well and don't get uncomfortable. The sound is just great.
4,"Pretty good quality, comfortable to use","Overall, I am happy with this purchase. I was, however, a little disappointed with the sound quality. Perhaps I am just not used to in-ear headphones, but sometimes the sound on these was distorted (bass was distorted or in general things sounded a little ""tin-y""). But I the more I use them, the more I like them."
4,"Excellent headset, could use better earbud rubber thingies.","The Etymotics headsets are in this price range and their ear buds are more sound isolating than this model, but the Etymotics cords get brittle and when you complain, you are ignored.The cords on this remain totally flexible as if new. Etymotics should buy cords from Sennheiser's supplier. Longer, thinner earbuds would be a plus, but they work well enough to give them a four. Had I not purchased the Etymotics before these, I would give these a five.I've also tried the Shure units like these, but I don't hear the difference. Trying the Shure in person would be a good idea to see if you want to pay the difference."
4,real good sound,"The sound is really very good, way better than I expected considering the cost of these. The earbuds are better than some selling for twice the price, but still not a great fit and not hours-long comfortable.For the price, I don't think these can be beat. These may not be ""the ultimate"" but they are pretty good, and at this price I can go anywhere with them and not be paranoid about losing them, they are easily replaced."
2,Too bright,"Bought them based on the reviews, let them break-in, but still too shrill/bright for me. The Sony 51's, by comparison, need more high-end clarity.On a tangent, if you think your iPod earphones is bass heavy and lacking in the highs, make sure they're oriented correctly in your ears. That makes a world of difference! Also try using them without the cloth covers.In case you think I'm some sort of nut job with crazy ears, the best sounding headphones that I own are, IMO, my Grado SR60's."
1,I was disappointed,"I bought this book because my husband is diabetic and Splenda is the most natural-tasting artificial sweetener. It appears to have been published in great haste in order to jump on the low-carb bandwagon. I returned it because it's full of errors. There are mispellings (2 on one page, one on another), nutrition information is figured wrong (a sample meal of pancakes with 3 pats of butter had zero grams of fat) and the first recipe --which I wanted to try--has no ingredients! I found these and other mistakes in just the first 30 or 40 pages. Nutrition info is very important to me and I don't feel I can overlook these errors. I can't trust what's in the rest of the book. I was really disappointed and returned the book to the store. I was also disappointed to hear that, because it wasn't a production error such as missing pages, they were just going to resell it! Don't buy this book--unless you don't mind taking a lot of chances when you cook."
5,Splenda the OTHER sweetener,What can I say. It's a cook book for people with sugar issues. Some good recipes. Good Book to have in your cooking book Library.
2,Fantastic Food with Splenda,This book has alot of different recipes for all type's of foods but i was not pleased with the page's are printed on cheep type of paper and there is no pictures give you an idea of what the dish should look like.
4,a conversation of characters,"I'll be brief. I show this video in my classroom to facilitate thinking. This is a good example of 'personalities' dicussing personalities. The conversation focuses on gender, but also becomes a good dialog on postmodern society. The good points in this video go far beyond the bad. I usually turn the video off when Robert breaks out his musical instrument (then we read his words outloud). His style is rarely appreciated at the community college level."
5,Humorous as well as educational,"It was great seeing/hearing these two remarkable characters in conversation--after having read their works in print. There's quite a bit of humor and mutual support despite the differences in gender, concerns, perspectives, and styles. It's short though--less than an hour of actual conversation. Their sincerity is obvious. This is an enjoyable as well as valuable item and is a great way to introduce someone to the intracacies of gender differences, gender-specific styles/needs, and improved communications between men & women. The characters are so delightful, I'm rounding up my score. Enjoy!"
4,Must Read if you aren't getting the love you want,"I read ""Is it Love or Is it Addiction"" when it first came out years ago. Then after I became a Registered Addiction Specialist and started working in the field of addiction it was on my reading list to clients. Ms Schaffer's book is an easy read and explains the difference between love and love addiction, and why we need another in our life to complete us. This book would be great for anyone who has suffered from any addiction. It is a book that can be read over and over, and gives new meaning as the reader works through different relationships."
3,A Little Too Clinical For Me,It's a good book but it's very clinical and a little difficult for a layperson to get into.
5,An excellent resource for addicts who want real love!,"I can't believe I am the first one to review this book! After struggling with addictions of all sorts for years (including alcohol, drugs, sex, and love addiction), I finally determined why I kept sabotaging my relationships with women. My compulsive search for something to help me feel less pain came from my childhood, and this book was the stepping stone that helped me see that there was hope to overcome this tricky addiction, seek help, and learn to love myself and others with authenticity.I highly recommend this book to any alcoholic, chemically dependent or sexually addicted person. There is hope for a relationship without painful addictive behaviors, and this book will help you find that hope!"
4,Vintage Marvels,"I've come to appreciate Tony Bennett more and more as years go by. These recordings from the 50s are amazing, particularly if you're more accustomed to his recent recordings. Technically speaking, some of them, especially the earliest of the recordings (this being a compilation) are somewhat annoying in that in those days way too much reverb was added, which can't be eliminated electronically now. But Tony shines through. Some very early songs, like ""Because of You"" and ""The Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" are way over the top. He hadn't really found his niche yet and was just blasting forth what was even then a fantastic voice. Age has brought to him a mellower tone and more stylistic commonsense. He isn't going to be around forever, but while he's here, let's hope he keeps recording. One can never get enough of beauty."
1,Cheaply made,"Unlike the elegant picture here on Amazon, this hand case organizer is very cheaply made and doesn't seem very sturdy at all. The inside pocket is just a thick piece of cardstock glued to one of the inside panels. Don't spend this much money on something this poorly made."
2,Disappointed,For some reason I thought this was going to be a mommy and baby yoga dvd. I was really excited to try and wen through the whole dvd and did not get any mommy and baby moves. I was very disappointed.
3,Just to clarify...,"The DVD says that it is 100 mins long, but only 40 of those are the Yoga portion. The remainder is the baby massage ""bonus"" feature, which is about an hour long repetition of material,which while interesting, could easily have been condensed into 15 minutes.The yoga portion is fine, though I think it is a bit of a waste of time to spend a third of the warm-up doing Kegels. And the cool-down portion is pretty skimpy as well.I would have preferred a longer yoga portion, with more detail to warming up the entire body, and a longer cool down, and a shortened baby massage portion.I would have been even more disappointed had I not read the reviews saying that the instructors don't show you how to use your child in the work-out (probably because it would have been so much harder to shoot). My baby refused to be integrated into the workout. That said, its cheaper than a Mommy and Me yoga class, so I'm not complining too much"
1,infant massage?,The DVD cover says Bonus Infant Massage Segment but there was no such segment on the DVD. I am very disappointed. Also I thought this was a yoga tape for Mom and baby not how to do yoga around a playing baby.
3,Good for Postnatal Exercise,"This is not a challenging workout, but if you want to be challenged, congratulations! - you are ready for regular workouts and not ones geared to postnatal women. I used to do power yoga prior to my pregnancy, but stopped exercising almost entirely during my pregnancy. Plus, I had a c-section. So, after months of not really exercising, I find this workout to be nice for my postnatal body. This workout should gradually strengthen my body and then I hope to return to my regular exercise."
3,Coils and Clicks: The Strangeness of Not-Quite-Man,"Gosh, I really expected more from this book...9 of the tales are well-crafted but 3 are stiff and humdrum. The offending tales aren't fanciful and sacrifice basic comprehension for unilateral pretension. Dammit!"
5,Dolphin puzzle,"It's a great one. Just enough variation to always find a match, yet still hard at 1,000 pieces. Great colors as well."
4,Every Landlord's tax Reduction Guide,I like the way the author wrote in a clear organized style. I found it much easier to understand then I had imagined. It is very comprehensive.Jim
4,Lots of helpful information...easy to understand,"When I bought this book, I had a basic understanding of what tax deductions I could take as a landlord. Reading this book helped me really understand everything in depth, and pick up some deductions I didn't know about.As a landlord, I think its important to have a solid understanding of how taxes work, even if somebody else does your taxes. This book will give you that knowledge, in an easy to read format."
5,Great book,"I needed a book to give me very detailed information on the tax deductions a landlord could take. I am thinking of turning my second home into rental property and I wasn't sure of the tax advantages. I found this book and it was very informative. I couldn't put it down and read the entire book in two days. Then, I went back and read the important parts again. After reading the book I feel like an expert on the subject. The book tells you how to keep records, figure out your basis, etc without having to refer to the numerous booklets the IRS provides the taxpayers. Definitely worth the money."
4,Comprehensive Explanation of Necessary Information,Although I haven't completed this book it is very comprehensive in explaining and covering the deductions alloweed and recordkeeping required for landlords. I am quite sure my tax man will appreciate the fact that I've studied up and have a working knowledge of the information in this book . For a new landlord it is a must have. Those who have been in the business awhile will also find it helpful.
4,Kindle vs Paperback - not the same,"Based on all the positive reviews, I just ordered the paperback edition. I would have preferred to get the Kindle version, but was afraid that any tables might not look as good electronically as they do on paper. When I used the ""Look Inside"" option for both the paperback and the Kindle version, I was shocked to see that the paperback was the 9th edition but the Kindle was only the 3rd edition. I don't know if this means that it's the 3rd electronic edition, which is the equivalent of the 9th print edition, or if the electronic copy is really a much older version of the author's work. Just to be safe, I bought the paperback. If anyone else can explain this, I urge them to do so."
5,Thank God I found this book!,"As a neophyte landlord, I couldn't be happier about stumbling onto this book. Clear and well-written, ELTDG is an invaluable resourse to get you on the right side of the tax-man. Many different topics are covered and, most likely, only some of the chapters will apply to you. Still, this book is a must-buy for any landlord who is going to handle their own taxes. Even if you have an accountant, reading this book will help you avoid mistake that you will have to pay someone else to sort through and correct. After reading this book, I reorganized all my records; the Schedule E will (hopefully) be a breeze now.Highly recommended."
5,Easy to read,"I'm a beginner landlord and I found this book easy to read and comprehend. Tax books are not the most exciting of reading material, so I'm only 1/4 of the way through it, but I have learned so much from it so far. I bought the book at the end of the year to prepare myself for taxes. I wish I bought it sooner, because there is many deductions that I could have taken. But it's a little late in the year now and the reciepts were trashed, so I loose there. Great book for first timers and I will probably need to refer to this book as I move into the next tax year."
2,"Lengthy description for simple things, wasting time reading it.","This book should be reduced by half in size. I have found many repeats, lenthy descriptions for easy-to-understand subjects, and hard to separate important issues from trivia. To be fair, I learned what I need from the book, but spent more than necessary in time and energy to sort out weeds from goods.I am surprised to find so many positive comments for the book, which make me suspicious to buy other books based on them."
3,"Works for Mac and PC, special features limited on Mac","This mouse works for both Mac and PC, but I would not recommend it for use with a Mac. Logitech does not seem to support any advanced features for this mouse. There are no software downloads for the various buttons that make this great for PCs. I bought this and a Logitech webcam at the same time and the webcam is having the same issues. This will be the last time I buy Logitech for my Macintosh computers."
3,Too sensitive when lifted,"This mouse works smoothly and is quite accurate. The problem is that the laser allows this mouse to move the cursor even when the mouse is lifted 1/4 inch off the surface of the desk. This is a real problem of you want to move the mouse a long distance across the screen using a move-lift/center-move gesture. For example, if I want to move the cursor from the left of the screen to the right, I would move the mouse right, lift it up, move it back to the left, set it down, move it to the right again. When moving this mouse back to the left while it is lifted, it will move the cursor back to the left instead of leaving it still. To avoid that, I have to lift the mouse uncomfortably high."
1,Keep away from it...far better products are out there,Horrible mouse. Cant get it to work properly on any surface. Decided to return it and buy a razor deathadder which works like a dream.
5,Laser Mouse,I was in need of a new mouse. I purchased this laser mouse and am very pleased with it's performance. It's a lot larger than those tiny ones making it a lot more comfortable and easier to use. I would definitely recommend this product.
2,Poor Setup,"Software for the Rx 1000 is tough to find and if you can find it, doesn't install. This was a waste for me."
1,"broken plastic inside, packed used","The other device has a broken plastic inside, it was also packed like it is used. I will never buy again from this seller. No quality. Hopefully it is working and I do not want to spend more money by returning it. I am expecting this device will fail very soon."
1,"Works fine for a few months, then dies","I bought the RC940 wireless jack to replace my RC926 (the former model from RCA), because my RC926 went dead on me.I am using this for a simple phone jack extension for my TiVO.Once again, just like the RC926, the RC940 worked fine for a matter of months, and then died on me. No matter what I do, the extension unit lights red which means that it cannot sync with the base unit. No rime or reason to this - unit worked fine, both base and extension used to light green, nothing changed, and now no amount of troubleshooting or following directions from the manual can rectify the problem.SO, like its predecessor the RC926, the RC940 is good...until it dies."
1,Simply does not work; extension unit connected once; then disconnected,"My experience with this wireless portable jack has been very disappointing. I needed to connect my fax machine in the room without a dedicated phone line.Installation:- Installed base and extension units within 20 ft of each other. Extension unit connected to the base unit without problems.Operation:- Began to fax. While faxing, there was very noticeable static noise on the line. Hopefully, error management logic between both fax machines would negate the line noise. Then - 10 seconds later, the extension unit suddenly dropped the connection. Could not reconnect it. Tried multiple times.Without a reliable connection to the base unit, the extension unit (and the entire product kit) is without value."
4,Works as advertised,"I bought this to connect my satelite receiver to a phone line in a room with no phone jacks.The RCA product works fine when the base unit and extension are on the same floor. When I moved the base unit to another floor, it did not connect. I must have exceeded the operating range.Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
1,Worthless,"Got these for a fax line. These are virtually unusable for a phone line as they have a lot of static but I already knew that from others' reviews. However, these are not very usable for a fax line either as half of the time they drop the connection and the other half the fax fails due to line condition."
1,dud,"never worked from the time it was taken out of the box. Would not recommend this product to anyone, a real dud"
1,Wouldn't work,System would not work on my home wiring as probably there is too much noise generated on the system by other devices. It is a shame that I cannot find a system like this that is truly wireless and does not rely on home electrical wiring to create a remote phone jack.
1,Died ovenight TWICE,I purchased this for my satellite TV and worked fine first evening. Got up the next morning and it would not communicate with base unit. Sent it back for a replacement. The replacement did the same thing. Sent back for a refund.
1,Wasted my money,After I set it up there was to much static on the line. So I had to disconnect every thing. So I wasted my money
1,Received item open,Received item open pkg although it was listed as new. Didn't work out of the pkg and sent them back.
1,I was very disappointed,Pats recordings do seem to be getting better as far as the studio quality goes but I'm very disappointed in the quality of Pat voice. I feel if Pat would sing with more quality instead of screaming out everything that he did then he would improve greatly.
2,Eh,"I am a big fan of Cory Morrow and not a big fan of Pat Green (too much of a name-dropper in his earlier days), so I may be a little biased. For the most part the CD seemed to be a Pat Green effort with some help from Cory. I also was a little disappointed with the song selection. I guess I expected this to be a sort of tribute to the heroes of real country music. Instead it is just a bunch of random songs."
2,I think these guys were drunk while recording this.,Why don't these guys just go ahead and start writing some songs instead of wishing and dreaming that they wrote these tunes. Some of these songs work better by the real artist who originally sung the song. Pat Green and Cory Morrow not bad singers I have seen them live here in Texas and they can put on a show pretty good. But this cd is just not good and is I'm just not hearing it. It sounds something from two guys singing about Texas and everything in Texas. These guys like to drink alot and we can all see that. I think there attitude towards Nashville stinks with a attitude like that you will not get anywhere in the music buisness and everyone in Texas should stop praising these two just because they sing about Texas and support the state. So What!
3,Ok to wish they'd written them...,"But they should have left the singing to the original artists.I love Pat Green, but he needs to stick to his own stuff."
1,One of the best Cd's you will ever hear fromPat Green,I really like this cd if you are just getting into Pat Green then this should be your next cd to buy. You really need this cd if you are a Pat Green fan.
5,Great Childhood Read,"I remember finding this book in the small library at my elementary school when I was in third grade. I was so excited by the yellowed pages and torn cover. As soon as I started reading it I was enthrawled and I didn't put it down once that WHOLE night. You can't imagine how thrilled I was when I was able to return it to the library the next day! It is cute and humorous and just a fun read for a little kid. It is the Pre-Harry Potter wizard novel, and a much easier, less frightening read for the youger set. I can't wait to read it again with a new set of eyes!"
4,Buy the book!,"Thombs (1999) offers a comprehensive review of the different theoretical approaches to addictive behavior. I found his differentiation between biological, psychological, and sociological perspectives quite helpful. He further breaks down psychological perspectives on addiction into psychoanalytic, behavioral, and cognitive models. Thombs also discusses the medical model of addiction that is derived from psychiatry. However, the text has two drawbacks. First, I never felt he gave a clear differentiation between ""dependence"" and ""addiction"" across all perspectives (e.g., biological, psychological, & sociological). Another drawback concerns the book's lack of emphasis on current ""spiritual"" approaches to dependence and addiction. He discusses the ""moral model"" of addictive behaviors early in the book but never re-visits the topic in detail. Current research and practice seem to emphasize a spiritual element to addictive behaviors."
4,Kill Your Lawn - Part 2,"Several years ago I converted my front lawn into a cactus garden. Actually, it's a hybrid cactus/zen garden. It has the requisite stream [dry of course] and dry pond. The buddhas have been replaced by coyotes and the lamps by Mexican-style chimneys. My neighbors seem to like it [at least they haven't tried to run me out of town]. Terry Hewitt's The Complete Book Of Cacti and Succulents has been an invaluable reference in my cactus education. It's a DK book and therefore has the killer DK style that I love so much. It's not as comprehensive as Miles Anderson's The Ultimate Book Of Cacti And Succulents [which Terry Hewitt consulted on], but it is still an excellent reference. My rating is actually higher than 4 stars, but not high enough to make it a 5 star book."
3,underwhelmed,"this book is scanty at best. very dissapointed by the lack of detailed information. the book reads more like a kid's book than anything else. Not much real content, just lots of flashy pictures. save the cash and just look this stuff up online. not much merit in actually owning this thing. i have NO idea why the reviews for this book have been so positive."
2,Book smelled like a cigarette,Never before have I received a book that stunk like a cigarette. What a stink. I had to throw it in the trash. Stay away from this seller
1,The complete book of cacti and succulents,This book looks nice but is useless for detailed information. When I bought it I was hoping for a comprehensive compendium of the care and detailed upkeep of succulents.
5,Growing Cacti and Succulents - the book,"It's an incredibly beautiful book in its illustrations, as well as being great growing information"
3,"Not the ""Complete"" Book without Yuccas!","This is a georgeous book, but it doesn't mention Yuccas at all! There is very little on Agavaceae in general.The outstanding photography makes it somewhat worthwhile. All of the plants are photographed on white seamless, so they really pop off the page."
1,What A waste of money,"This is simply a regular roll of toilet tissue that has had the flat ends dipped in glue. When you try to rip it off only the middle of the roll is moveable and it just tears into pieces. So, it DOES tear. I thought it was the type of paper that actually doesn't tear at all. Don't bother with this."
2,"Great fun, but not when your roommate has no idea what it is","i purchased this, thinking it would be a fun gag to play on my roommate, and he ended up tearing the thing up and using it himself in little shreds! the thing was gone in about 2 weeks! its a great idea, but not if you can tear the thing up and use the whole thing up that quickly! what the roll is, is just a thing of toilet paper glued together all over. i can easily do this myself with a regular roll of toilet paper so dont waste your money on this!!"
2,Pretty Disappointing,"Alright, first let me mention that the product was delivered later than I asked; meaning that the system is slow to receive it. Next, when it had been delivered, the design looked realistic, but from the side-view it looked almost as though someone glued or splashed water on it (meaning a picky/germophobic person would probably not want to use it) and that was the issue with my victim; they just grabbed another, normal roll instead. Finally, when someone did end up using it, they just ripped it to shreds; tore it apart. All in all, this product basically sucks."
1,Satan will like this one,"Attacking the inerrancy of Scripture is one of Satan's most poisonous tactics, in the war against Jesus and His people. The thief comes to steal, people. The author seems to question everything that's fundamental about Christianity; the Resurrection, the divinity of Christ, Paul's conversion. Perhaps Mr. Wright has not actually encountered the Living God? Don't let the biased ""scholarship"" of this book diminish anything about your relationship with the Risen King of Kings, Jesus Christ. Only those who endure to the end will be saved. To the author: Tell Satan I said ""hello"", when you're greeted to eternal punishment in Hell!"
1,Blasphemy!,"A.N. Wilson has wrote a whole book based on the book of Acts. Yet he does not believe the book of Acts. He picks and chooses what he wants to believe so he can make up an imaginary Paul, very different from the Biblical Paul. I bought this book thinking I could get some more information on the Apostle Paul from other historical sources besides the Bible.Instead I get a man using the Bible for a book, when he does not even believe the Bible.REPENT VIPER! Repent and accept the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST!"
2,"Sloppy, inaccurate scholarship","Wilson uses the Bible to flesh out his portrait of Paul. Unfortunately his scholarship is sloppy and inaccurate. Some biblical references are simply wrong. His arguments are confused, muddy and his prose is turgid. This is more of a popularized info-novel than a serious work of history.."
2,It's History 101 all over again.,"Painfully verbose, this book was obviously written by a historian. The flow of the book is constantly interrupted by meaningless tangents that contribute little or nothing to the whole picture.It's History 101 class all over again.The author is in the habit of using the Bible as a credible source of information when it supports his assertions, and then discrediting it as a source when it contradicts his assertions. It is quite clear that the author is knowledgeable on the subject, however, he needs to remember that educated guesses are not facts. Historical study dictates that one must gather information from different sources to get a clearer picture of the past. However, this author goes a bit too far. Constants based on variables may work with economics, but not with history."
4,The Truth (Like God) Is In The Details,"Having read this book a number of times, I'm always fascinated not so much by who or what the Apostle Paul was or even did, but by what was going on around him that made the spread of Christianity possible (e.g., the expansive Roman road system, the increasing number of Gentile God-fearers, the increased interest Empire-wide for Eastern religions stressing the personalized interior life, the simmering conflict between Rome and Jerusalem, the Jerusalem Church v. the Antioch Church and their possible disputes over proper interpretation of ""the Way"", etc.). We perhaps pin too much on Paul's personal ambition and vision such that we tend to forget the strange and even wonderful geo-political calculus and religious synchronicity that made conditions inviting for this one-time Jewish heresy ever to have made it's way out of ancient Palestine."
4,A thought provoking study of an immense personality,"I was rather surprised by the variety of reviews to this engaging book on Paul. Part the problem rests with the title,'Paul, the Mind of the Apostle', which might have led some to assume this was a devotional or theological work. This is, in fact, a historical biography. Wilson brings a historian's detachment from matters of doctrine or faith and focuses on the temporal man, his work and his age. He paints a rich tapestry of the Pax Romana and the various religious 'cults' which populated it. In some cases his 'spin' is decidedly modern and secular. Given both the constraints and potential of this perspective, this book provides a valuable resource for true believers and skeptics alike of a man who's influence on Western thought and society is incalculable."
1,I wish I could give this book 0 stars...,"This book was disappointing. I found the topic of an analysis of Paul's character to be intriguing. Unfortunately, there is nothing in this book that would lead me to a better understanding of Paul than before I spent time reading it. What I do now know however, is that A.N. Wilson does not like Jews or Christians, and Christians, and did I mention Christians. Again, disappointing - I would not recommend this book."
1,Paul: Through the Mind of A. N. Wilson,"Sometimes I wonder why an author feels compelled to be extra zealous about weaving in their 2 cents worth when it comes to religious history... I was interested in Paul's mind, not Wilson's. Regardless of what any reader would believe, I don't think that Wilson is successful in convincing anyone of buying into his diatribe."
1,A REALLY bad book...make it REALLY REALLY BAD,"Although I'm not a Christian...nor a woman of any religion, I cannot understand why Wilson is so bitter. He seems to look at Christianity with questions that deny their goodness. Was he a Christian himself? A man of the church who reflects back on his life and asks, ""Why did I ever join that ridiculous group?"" In fact, his novel does not give a detailed analysis of the main character; instead, we can only understand that Wilson doesn't like Christianity, and never will."
1,Poorly Researched Tripe,"Wow!!!!Unbelievable garbage...I guess the author never read the Didache...I can't believe the 5 star reviews praising his scholarship...Notice they are by people with an ax to grind against Christians.......One even suggested the movie"" The Last Temptation Of Christ."" as a companion to this worthless garbage....No research.Just the author's own suppositions..A great read for those with narrow minds and limited I.Q.'S..."
1,Don't Waste your Time or Money on this one!,"This book is very anti-Christian, written by an obvious unbeliever. What a waste! If anyone feels this author has made valid claims, I suggest they keep looking.....start with ""More Than A Carpenter"" by Josh McDowell."
3,"Good research, bad analysis","In this book there is quite a lot of interesting information about the life of Paul. Not only this but the author gets quite busy interpreting the many aspects of the writings of Paul where he might have actually 'invented' christianity as such. In order to ground this claim however, there is much guessing and throwing of ideas that might seem interesting, but without much grounding in reality."
3,A Bible Study out of Context,"This book is a study of Paul's life and the culture in which he lived in. Although, this author is obviously not a Christian, he helps the reader understand some of the things that went on and were believed at the time of the apostle. He is obviously confused on the seeming contradictions within the Bible and here is where we part company. His notion that Paul was not really a Pharisee and that Paul mingled various beliefs along his way to Rome needs work. Another case of reading the Bible out of context."
2,A good book - to understand a bad approach,"This book is good if you want to understand the thinking an approaches used by one that does not believea) Jesus is God or ever claimed to be Godb) The apostles were inspired in any wayd) Scripture is inspired by God and applicable to usAccording to this book there are three main groups coming from Paul, Peter, and James. James is the only one that ""got"" the meaning of Jesus' teaching, and that was to do good deeds. Peter and Paul had their own spins and battled it out with Paul's version winning the popular non-Jewish influence. It is sad this is even classified as ""religious"". But if you want to understand the approaches these type of people will use, this is a good reference book."
1,Wilson's Apostle - Not worth the price,"This is a really bad book. Why ? The title gives the appearance of relating to a critical and thorough analysis of the Apostle Paul. It is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. Rather than contribute at length with a point by point dissention of its elusive title - I will just say that you need only go to your local library and read the first chapter to get a feel for the entire book. If you haven't the time for such frivolity -then just read the end of page 16 and beginning of page 17 where the paragraph concludes with another tongue-in-cheek dangler asking ""And surely it is obvious what Christianity is ?""Need I say more. Yes ! This is a fictional book masquerading as non-fiction."
4,Really nice!,"The cards are nicely painted. My daughter loves looking at them. They are really big, a little bit less than a A4 format! So that's my only problem, it takes a lot of space!"
5,"Adorable, pretty and just what I needed","I hosted a baby shower for a friend and bought these to serve as both decorations and a shower gift. I hung these cards on twine ""clotheslines"", interspersed with baby clothes and toys, and the finished look was truly adorable. After the shower, we gathered them up and put them back in their very nice box for my friend to use when her baby is a little older! The cards have lovely illustrations and are fun to look at. Kids will enjoy them."
3,Too much trouble,"I guess I shouldn't complain about something that I got as a throw-in, but this thing is just too much trouble for me. It is a fairly tight fit to begin with, then they have some kind of elastic around the bottom (to hold it snug, I guess). It's like putting a tight dress on a manequin, pulling, tugging, straightening. I never did get it all the way on, I'll just use it to store spare grill parts or something.It probably looks good once you get it on, but according to some posts at the weber smokey mountain website, it's not even water tight. If anybody really wants one of these things just for show, I'll give you mine for half price."
4,A noir classic,"Somewhat overlooked in the filmography of Elia Kazan, ""Panic in the Streets"" is nonetheless a riveting, atmospheric thriller that is among the best film noirs. The cast is flawless with Richard Widmark in one of his earliest good guy roles, and Jack Palance in one of his best turns as a villain."
1,Like an unfinished film.,"This movie is like an unfinished film. Even though it does have a beginning, middle, and end, it does not involve you in the characters really. Hardly any character is empathetic they are just a bunch of mean people that stand around arguing with the police. Jack Palance featured on the cover has a lessor role. The movie moves too fast to give you a chance to get involved. The idea is so single, ""the plague"", and has little else to support it. Oddly the illness is put on the back burner to the mouthing off of the police and military doctor which is not interesting. I can see that the script had many of the important film elements but it did not jell. This is the type of movie you shut off before you get to the end then you sell or throw away. The marketing on the front cover is all this DVD has to offer but the famous name Elia Kazan on the cover does not improve the contents at all."
1,Disappointing DVD,"This is a rip off DVD with no special features or even an English subtitle mode. The sound is awful, the image is grainy, the whole production is sub-par. For such a ""classic"" this is a shameful treatment of a wonderful film by the legendary Elia Kazan. Try to find a better treatment of this movie."
4,Intriguing Film Noir,"Although there is a murder early on, this movie centers on the panic of a health inspector and the New Orleans law enforcement that there may be an outbreak of plague. Very interesting and compelling, I enjoyed this very unique story. Good acting all around."
5,"excellent casting , well plotted story, great photography","The casting in this movie was fantastic. There are parts in this movie that are quite believable. The New Orleans setting adds greatly to this story. This movie is a combination of mystery, action and high emotions.It is a black and white film, and probably should remain this way to best dramatitize this film. This movie is a prime example of how excellent casting can make or break the effectiveness of a movie.Even if the story line is not of great interest to you, the acting quality and the filming is a quite a treat."
5,Wonderful,This work book is a wonderful tool to help kids practice their cutting skills. I purchased this along with a good pair of scissors for my son to practice before starting school in the Fall.
4,Loved the activities but I wish they had a perforated edge,My 2 year old has loved these cutting activities but I wish that the edge was perforated. I have to individually cut out each paper and often times I end up cutting into the picture.
4,great book with one complaint,"My daughter is 4 and just finished this book. She LOVED it would try to get out of meals early so she could go cut! She was slow to start but all of a sudden it ""clicked"" for her and I am so proud that she made it look easy towards the end. Maybe she has my art teacher gene!? I am hoping! My only complaint is that it is easier for the child to cut once the page is separate from the book and there are no perforated edges to tear the individual pages out. I had to basically break the binding to get the pages out and getting them out without tearing into the content of the page seemed challenging for me! Why don't they have perforated pages?? Other than that, the book gets an A+."
5,Great help for developing skills!,My son loves to cut and this helps him learn how to stay on the lines. The cutting lines are thick and easy to follow for a 4 year old. I think it is helping him develop his small motor skills too which is great for learning to write his letters. A+ in my book. I like all the kumon books we have used so far.
5,Good for 5 year old to develop fine motor skills,"My 5 year old son is having trouble writing at school so he started doing Kumon workbooks to improve fine motor skills and hand strength. I was reluctant to buy this workbook because it's for younger kids, but this and the Tracing book were great for him. It probably took him about 30 minutes total to do each book, in two sessions. He is developing fine motor skills without a fight and enjoying it so it's worth the money to me."
3,Not the best,"There are common words missing. Should have bought the Oxford H-E dictionary I found later. This one leaves out many obvious words, but compact."
2,Not a necessity,"When I first looked inside this book through the ""Look Inside"" option, I thought it was a dictionary for hebrew acronyms, but when I bought it I found out that it wasn't, it was a small dictionary with some acronyms explained at the end as an appendix.I don't recommend buying it, there are better dictionaries like the Oxford english-hebrew hebrew-english dectionary."
5,high quality instruction,"This is a very good series that each Kata will be shown from the front, side, top, back view and in slow speed. There is also an explanation for the application of the movement in the kata.However, please note that the kata in this video are Hakkaku and Jion."
5,Soundtrack for The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,"""Hauntingly evocative and memorable"" is a phrase I have seen used in respect of the soundtrack of this outstanding epic from the 1960s. As a child I remember watching every year in the summer for this to come up on the TV schedules and I watch every episode. Superbly produced for the day, and the music from the series never left me, even though that was now 40+ years ago I would still find myself humming or singing sections.I was delighted to find the original series on DVD on Amazon.co.uk and ordered it immediately. Later I found this CD of the music and it was ordered the second I saw it.This CD is (as was the DVD) absolutely fantastic and the music is beautifully crafted and reproduced in crystal clear clarity. I am so thankful to the seller for making this so accessible and easy to get - thank you so much.Paul"
1,Waste of Time and Money,"I bought this software for the sole purpose of ripping, and was sadly disappointed. I admit I'm not the smartest man I know, but I could have sworn I didn't see anything on the product specification page, stating that this product is nothing more than a demo. So, to get to the point if you buy this program you will only get twenty rips then it will lock up till you buy the full version. Buy the full version? Isn't that what I have. So, I wasted my time trying to figure what the hell was going on with this software. I don't know why in the hell amazon would SELL a demo. I can understand them distributing them free, but selling them. Shame on You Amazon, Shame on YOU!"
3,Bonsai Tree didn't last long...,I didn't think this was going to be an issue but this tree didn't last very long. I followed all instructions and conditions were normal for the plant. The plant was did have 3 leaves that were starting to change color. It was pretty and nice to have while it lasted.
2,ticked off dance junkie from pa,"i first of all. i gave this 2 stars only because i love any dancemusic. the first one was awesome. i dont know what they tried to do with this second one, but i didnt find maybe one song i liked on this double cd. and it even had a 3rd best of electonica cd and that sucked too...well id say stay away from this one..."
2,Disapointing.,"This compilation doesnt even touch the first one. I was very shocked when I kept hitting ""next track"" on my player. I think I really only stopped at the BT track. If you are into electronica chances are you already own the good tracks on this album. Save your money and check out other compilations like Jungle Sky, deep concentration, jungle massive...."
2,What Happened?,"Ok, so I am ON FIRE from DE-I and I buy DE-II without listening to any tracks. BIG MISTAKE!! It's hard to believe anyone involved in DE-I had anything to do with this sorry sequel. I found these ""Barbie Goes Techno"" tracks so dated and boring they were almost insulting, and I'm no techno officionado -- I just know what I like. I kept hitting the next track button on my first listen and I have not heard a single song all the way through. I haven't even been motivated to give it a second try. DE-III more than delivers on the promises of DE-I. Trust me, stick with the prime numbers on this series and skip DE-II."
5,I think is a good collection of Thin lizzy,"Not complete, but the essential, this band was great! I think is not do a compilation of this great band."
2,"No way, no way...","You simply cannot take a band with Lizzy's caliber and vast discography, throw in it 16 songs and call it ""DEFINITIVE COLLECTION"". Call it ""Best Of"", ""Greatest Hits"", whatever. But ""Definitive"" this is not, no way!That's why I rate it two stars: not for the songs (which are great) but by the misleading concept of this merchandise."
5,He's Luscious! He's Lucien Barbarin,"Having seen him perform on tour with Harry Connick Jr.'s Big Band, I have gained an appreciation of the tremendous talent of Lucien Barbarin. I have followed his career closely and this is the one CD that captures Lucien's talents as a showcase. I had the fortune of capturing the performance in person one Sunday in New Orleans at the Palm Court Café (1204 Decatur Street) and have seen the live version of this CD. What can I say? He's Luscious! And so is this CD!"
5,Tolstoy's Waltz,"Tolstoy's Waltz is a 2005 BIS Records AB recording starring pianist Lera Auerbach and baritone Chiyuki Urano. Music notes are in English, French and German. Lyrics are available in English and Russian. A very relaxing and calming recording that I very much enjoyed. Excellent performance by both performers indeed. Highly recommended. 5/5."
2,Late and incomplete,I ordered several items from Barry Farms to make a holiday dish and my order not only arrived too late but was incomplete. I got a note inside the box saying my ingredient was not available but I would have appreciated knowing that prior to getting my order so I could have placed an order elsewhere. I live in a remote area and have to order a lot of ingredients online so I was just out of luck. A simple email would have sufficed.
4,mike's review,"this book was good. I also liked Vol. 5: the return of serpentor, and Vol. 7: union of the snake."
4,BTO Gold,"BTO were a Canadian rock quartet featuring former Guess Who guitarist Randy Bachman. ""Not Fragile"" was released in 1973 which was slap dab in the middle of the progressive / glitter rock era. Their style was mostly straight forward guitar rock but they could mix in some slower bluesy numbers. No synthesizers or epic length tracks here; it's all about the four-minute double lead guitar attack. The band's biggest hit ""Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet"" is here along with ""Rollin' Down the Highway"" and the title track (a personal favorite). The slower numbers ""Rock is my Life...."" and ""Blue Moanin'"" both give a bit of a breather because the rest are just like the title says ""Not Fragile"". If you like your classic rock hard-driving with loud vocals and plenty of guitars.....look no further.A 4.5....just two weaker tracks like ""Second Hand"" and ""Giving It All Away"" stops it just short of being consistently great."
5,BTO at its absolute best,I bought this album when it first came out on vinyl (remember LPs?).It is every bit as good today as it was back then. This is classic BTO and every cut is worthy of listening to. I'm going to have to break down and get the CD (although I hate paying for music twice... kind of like upgrading my VHS collection to DVD... painful).
3,Bad cover reproduction,"As usual a great re-issue have been delivered with quality sound.The gatefold cover-at the same time, though printed on a very good paper,inside of the gatefold and on the back cover- all dark,blurry out of focus unlike great repro-covers of Golden Earring or Shocking Blue."
5,This Is The Definitive BTO Album,"NOT FRAGILE is the first BTO album to purchase. It is chock-full of terrific songs, and is a unique blend of English rock, Southern rock, and Texas boogie influences. Standout songs include the title track, ""Roll On Down The Highway"", ""You Ain't Seen Nuthin' Yet"", ""Sledgehammer"", and ""Blue Moanin'."" Compared to this one, Poison and Soundgarden sound about as dangerous as Al Stewart."
2,Tape didn't work .,"Service was good, price was OK, but cassette tape didn't work when immediately tested. So tape=one star. But price and service was good and i should have returned it before throwing away the label..my prob. I guess they don't test them all !! So 2 stars. DG"
1,loud/noisy early heavy metal,this music is just loud white noise. It should only be recommended to headbangers who think Poison or Cinderella is cool
3,BTO's best,This LP was the loudest record I owned until I bought Master of Puppets over 20 years later. The best of the bunch for BTO.Listening to Sledgehammer with the headphones cranked still gives me chills when Fred Turner kicks in with the chorus after Randy Bachman's mellower verses. One of the best lessons anyone could learn when trying to write heavy rock and roll with lots of melody.
3,Is there another sequel?,"I am sad to say, that as much as I waited for her this sequel to come out. I am very disappointed in it, it left me completely unsatisfied. Why did she choose to end the book, the way she did? I know that I am not the only person who wanted so badly to see some kind of reconciliation between Sean and Lisa? What about Lisa and Nicoles relationship? or the relationship between Nicole and her baby Shawna? Whats going to happen with Michelle? Ms. Shapodee left a lot of gaps and unanswered questions in this novel, does anyone agree? I love her as a writer, but am highly disappointed with Broken Beyond Repair, maybe she should have just left it broken. Also, how come she had so many other stories going on, with her new characters. I could have cared less about them. My main focus was on Lisa, Sean, and Nicole, and I thought that was what the focus of the story was suppose to be."
2,School of E. Lynn Harris for Sequel Training - NOT!,"If you are looking for a great value, you get three or more storylines in one book. Anxiously waited on the sequel & was highly disappointed."
2,Can't walk with them,"I got this for my seven year old and she can't walk with them!, the plastic it's too hard and it breaks easily..since the plastic won't bend she looks like a robot trying to walk..not a good item for children"
5,"A ""Salsa Dura"" masterpiece for all times.","Originally released in 1975, this timeless album is a Salsa masterpiece in every way--I'd personally go as far as saying that it's THE most important Salsa recording ever. Why? These legendary musicians took Salsa's Afro-Cuban and Afro-Puerto Rican roots to the forefront in a way no other artist had ever done previously. Guaguancos, rumbas, descargas and other Afro-Cuban-derived rhythms are all included here. ""Cuba Linda"", ""Choco's Guajira"", ""Anabacoa"" and ""Iya Modupue"" are glorious masterpieces yet to be equalled. Manny Oquendo, Jerry Gonzalez and Andy Gonzalez (and some other musicians featured here)would go on to form the equally-superb Conjunto Libre several years after recording this masterpiece. INDISPENSABLE!!!"
5,Only Needed Gene Kelly Back!,"This 1951 recording is as close to the original 1940 cast as it could get. Vivienne Segal recreated her role and delivered a definitive Bewithced, Bothered, and Bewildered. It was a shame Gene Kelly was not engaged to recreate Joey for the recording,(or for that matter June Havoc and Van Johnson) but by 1951 he was MGM's biggest male star and probably had no interest. Still the score is preserved and performed nicely (particularly by Segal). Not as technically well done as later recordings, but retains the flavor of the original perfectly. A great score!!!"
4,Jane Froman,I love Jane Froman in the lead. She had such a glorious voice and knew how to use it. This cast is available with the With A Song in My Heart album for anyone who is interested.
5,Their best album without a doubt,"Gone is the aggressive nature of past albums, though some tracks do retain a hint of edginess.On the whole a very melodic album, full of beautiful sounding electronic songs which manage to utilise other rhythms rather than sticking to a 4/4 beat all the time.All of the tracks make the album a great listening experience and as such there is no real highlight, all songs are of equal, high quality. (But do check out 'Southern Cross' and 'Nimbus'!)"
4,Measure Your Spot Carefully,"Giving this four stars...Five for styling, overall looks and quality.Three stars because they are MORE THAN 4"" diameter if you include the stone guard.I had to send these back because they would not fit in the 4"" cutouts on my 2008 Charger. The lamp HOUSING is 4"". But there is a screw on both sides of the lamp bringing the space needed to 4-1/4 inches. Then add to that the rim/bezel of the stone guard that snaps OVER those screws, and you will need just under 4-3/4"" for these lamps. My car had zero extra space. Very disappointed. Be sure to check your spot carefully."
3,Disappointing Light Output,"The quality of this product and ease of installation were both excellent; however, the light output was extremely disappointing. It may be partially because I'm not accustomed to the yellowish-tint of the light, but it didn't feel like $200-worth of light output."
3,PIAA Fog Lights,"The lights are fantastic and fit the factory mounting location perfectly, however the switch that came with the wiring harness was faulty."
3,"If you loved Happy End of the World, you'll like this.","It's still a mellow yet upbeat listen, but not as catchy or distinctive as Happy End of the World."
4,One of P5's Many Great American Releases,"Those put off by albums recorded in languages other than English should relax--and the best way to relax is to listen to this accessible, upbeat, and almost groovy album by the Japanese group Pizzicato Five. Leaders in the shibuya-kei movement, P5 demonstrates their consistent skill in songs like ""Wild Strawberries"" and personal favorite ""Room Service."""
2,A step in the wrong direction,"Pizzicato 5 are at their very best when they sound new and fresh. This recording is old and stale. There is nothing here that departs from what you've heard from them before with the exception of the tracks ""20th Century Girl"" (the one redeeming feature of this album) and ""Tout, Tout Pour Ma Cherie"" (an abysmal failure...). The remaining songs all sound like you've heard them many times before in superior versions.Where ""Happy End of The World"" was a leap forward for P5, ""The Fifth Release"" is a step backwards. If you're looking to buy a P5 album, do yourself a favour and get one of the other ones."
3,The Mystery Of Eatum Hall,This book is pretty silly and cute but it didn't really hold my son's attention. It is not one of the books he asks me to read over and over again. Other kids might really enjoy it though. I liked it better than a lot of the books my son really enjoys.
3,"What is Dr. Hunt ""FRSW""?","Good project to help kids read for detail and to identify clues. My daughter's 3rd grade class enjoyed it, although I found it a bit gruesome. My question: One scene showed a letter signed by Dr. Hunt ""FRSW"" or some initials like that, following his name. What do the initials mean?"
2,DVD vs CD,"It is a pop concert format. Visually stunning but there is very little to show how the music is produced.Camera work is very distracting, changing scenes every second.About 5 minutes in total of the program shows how the pianist produces this magic.If you are a fan of Lang Lang's playing then I recommend you buy a CD of the concert rather than the DVD.Surely the reason for a film of a pianist is to see how he/she makes the music."
3,Classical Fusion,"Lang Lang played some good music recorded in the Blu-ray. The sound was good and the performance, from what I can see, is good. However, the same could not be said about the video editing. The scenes are no longer than 2 seconds. I suppose the person who did the video editing thought that this is a rap/pop/dance concert and kept on cutting between different cameras. That makes watching the virtuoso performance very difficult. This technique is used in that pop culture to hide the fact all those movements since the music is simple and the dancing repetitive. It would be hard to say what the viewing experience would be like should a more conventional video editing technique is used."
2,Interesting piece,This is a very desired CD more for the collectiblity rather than the score. I found it fairly cheap. It is not worth the high prices except if you are a completist and must have everything that Tiomkin composed. The sound quality is very tinny and poor. The cover is the best thing about the CD.
3,Solid and informative.,"Nothing spectacular, but a good, solid biography, this book does a solid job of telling the story of Joan of Arc. Some might find the chapter on movies that have been made about the story of Joan superfluous; others may find it an interesting extra; likewise, some might be put off by the unabashedly non-religious perspective of the author, while others may find it a refreshingly different perspective. But for the most part, this book is simply a good, solid telling of the tale."
2,Trying to impress you with her English writting skills,"Poorly written book by an English professor that seems to think showing off her English writing skills, fancy words and drawn out descriptions, is a good thing. She also does a poor job of presenting the life story in a believable, well laid out manner. She seemed to jump back and forth from what seemed like a well researched, true history of Joan to a fictional extrapolation or imagination of what people dreamed up to make Joan a appear as a famous person."
4,fine. fine writer,"As all of Gordon, written beautifully, direct and simplified style. Wish author had included more of her brilliant theories about victimization."
2,Very brief and sometimes even boring!,"Even being a brief book, the writer accomplished the hard task of turning Joan's life into a sometimes boring narrative. Anyway, if you're looking to start knowing the basics, this is a good book to start.The chpater at the end where the writer spent time writing about dramatization in books and movies about Joan's life is utter useless, in my opinion is totally desnecessary and the worst part of hte book.Also, do not expect detailed accounts of the battles."
2,It's a question of credentials,"This book does not turn out to be what I thought it would be, namely a memoir about the influence of Joan of Arc on the novelist's life. As such it would have been interesting. What we have is a derivative work with unreliable scholarly apparatus. Gordon is an interesting writer whom I have read with pleasure, but regretfully I have to say that the ten or so Joan of Arc books she drew on for her ""Joan of Arc"" still make better and more reliable reading."
3,"Detailed character sketch of the ""warrior-maiden""","If you are looking for a detailed biography of Joan of Arc, do not begin with this slender little book. Although it contains the basic events and chronology and although it includes color from bits of social commentary, it is not an in depth analysis, nor does it purport to be. Rather, it is an extended character sketch of a remarkable woman whose life -- except for the short time during which she went to battle, was captured, and endured a trial whose outcome seems to have been pre-ordained -- is obscure. It is interesting to realize that many of the details of her life come from her confession and from testimony at her trial.Mary Gordon's is at her best when analyzing the dichotomy inherent in Joan of Arc's appeal as a warrior-maiden. Her ruminations lean at times a bit too much toward stream-of-conscious; however, she does prove capable of inserting quite a bit of information in the short format imposed by this series."
2,And where is the biography?,"This is not a biography but a sort of reflection on Joan of Arc's life that gets a bit too romantical, reiterative and tedious after a while. I thought I was buying a biographical work (i.e., serious research, extensive sources, facts, and the like), so I was very disappointed. For those willing to learn more about Joan, I recommend Regine Pernoud's entertaining (and also scholarly) ""Joan of Arc: By Herself and Her Witnesses"". At least, you'll be spared the Jean Plaidyish stuff."
2,If you are looking for an overview and personal medidation..,"If you want an overview and personal meditation, then this book is for you. If not, then you will probably be disappointed. Clearly, in so short a book, one doesn't expect to find excessive detail, but very much was missing from this book. Add to this a dullish style, and there isn't much to redeem the book.The bright sides of the book were the sections on Joan's virginity and the review of how Joan was potrayed by various authors and in various films. But this is not enough to make up for an otherwise tepid book.I don't think the book measures up to the others in this series that I have read to far on St. Augustine and Mao Tse Dung."
2,I received a message with an attachment I can't open,I am trying to contact you about your attachment sent to my email which I cannot open.
2,Silly girl,"Gordons' introduction betrays her lack of direction, the thrust and falter that aspires to the spirit of but does not match the ""meditations"" of the others in the series. The language frequently breaks down into ungainliness (words repeated in a sentence as if a coffee break intervened, neither aural flow nor theme sustained) and errors such as speaking of Joan's gender (people have sex, their names have gender). Does not compare well with Hardwick's Melville (tough standard), or say the hard focus of Deus Lo Volt, the excruciating endoscopy of the crusades. Not that Joan is altogether absent. I would like to have Saramago do a Joan. Or even Monty Python, to clear the air (""always look on the bright side of the fire""). Give me irreverence over pietism any day. Saramago's intrusions are challenges; Gordon's are impertinences. Monty Python rubbishes our retropections; Gordon turns them into hot flashes."
1,Flamenco cagao,"To any one who love flamenco, this is not flamenco, and it should not be rated as flamenco music.Juan amaya"
5,Felt like I was in Spain!,"Although I was familiar with only 1 of the songs on this CD, all the songs are now my favorites!Easy to listen to. I'm so glad that I bought it!"
3,Liner notes,"This CD is okay, it's good.The writing on the CD packaging is amazingly pretentious, this point is well summed up in the last two sentences of the passage. ""Without Liebert, there would be no music known as Nouveau Flamenco. It's kind of like imaging a world without the Beatles or John Coltrane, and that's a world I don't want to know about."""
5,Incredible.,"I bought Sonya's CD based on the fact that I truly enjoy Vince Gill's music, and I'd read somewhere that he sings with her on this CD, and that he'd even produced some of the songs on it. Well, I must say I wasn't disappointed in my purchase ONE BIT. Sonya's voice is pure and clear and very unique. Her songwriting is great, too. I am not a huge fan of Shania or of Martina or Faith, and had about given up on the young women of country until I heard Sonya. Her voice stands out like a bright white light on a canvas of black velvet. Smooth, clear, lyrical and tender. If you like soft, sweet, and strong, here's a girl for you."
5,fast,"Just as promised, great condition , fast delivery. The Isaac's are an awesome Bluegrass band, really enjoyable Never disappointed they are a talented family! Sonya is blessed with a sweet talent."
3,"A moderate success, get it if you're a Barbara Cook fan","Barbara Cook sings some of the best stuff in this 1950s musical about, believe it or not, the PA Amish. I believe this musical is performed quite often at theaters in PA. Babs is young, and this is before hitting stardom with ""The Music Man"" & ""She Loves Me."" In this cd, she sings the feisty ""I'll Show Him"" and duets the lovely ""Follow Your Heart."" Another good sing is the haunting male chorus of ""Plain We Are,"" the finale of Act 1. Still, this is a unique musical & I'm not sorry I got it. It's been out of print for years before this cd"
3,"good footage, not an annual film","Good footage and soundtrack, but not one of Warren's annual films with narration. My mistake for not researching it more."
4,Ok..Ok..Ignore the rap sheet.,"See. This is a prime example of how we hold artists back with ""good ol' days syndrome"". I can explain this record in one fell swoop: If this were a debut recording by a unknown band with unknown members, people and press would be gushing all over this.I didn't care for Blur and Verve was ok in my book, but remained on the periphery due to its short lifespan, and Simonon hasn't done anything since The Clash. Since the preconceptions were subdued, I listened to the record the first time with an open mind. I wasn't waiting for that Blur blitz or that Verve hook or that Clash swagger. As a result, I have a record that is truly engaging and beautiful, especially if you've ever been to London."
3,Well...,"I really like this album, because I'm a major fan of The Gorillaz, and The Clash, so I figured to give this a test.I think alot of the CD is amazing, but I think you can also note where the songs sound similar in sound.Certain Songs like:80's LifeGreen FieldsHurcleanStand out among the others because they have a very, very specific sound to them.I'd still recommend giving it a listen, regarless."
3,good..,"Good music, but not genius. This album sounds rushed, i bet their next will be great.p.s. History Song sounds a lot like United States Global Empire by Mason Jennings."
3,I'll keep it short...,"This record is kind of like the Combat Rock-era Clash and I have a love-hate relationship with that era.The thing is, Combat Rock has aged remarkably well and I suspect this record will as well.Best song - Herculean."
4,Albarn can do no wrong,"I've been a blur fan for years and I'm always interested in Damon's side projects. As soon as I found out he was doing this I had to run out and buy it (never knowing what to expect from him). I was quite pleased with it. It is more blur than gorillaz, but I wouldn't even classify it as Blurish because this album (apart from D.A.'s vocals) is nothing like blur. It's very mellow, which I like because I'm a mellow kind of guy. It also seems very bass driven but not dancy. It's a mish mash of all sorts of sounds but Albarn and his crew bring it together and make lovely music with it. If you are a blur fan you'll probably like this album. If you are a gorillaz fan you may not."
3,The Good...,"I liked this album okay, it was quite mellow. If you are disappointed in the new direction Bloc Party has taken, as am I, this would be good for you."
4,It grows on you.....,"It's like Gorillaz, but with a weird Middle Eastern flavor. Damon Albarn once again surprises us... a weird mixed up album, every song is very different, lots of variety, some of it is hypnotic, trancelike...and I listen to it every day. Damon's voice is excellent and holds it all together."
3,"Some good, some bad","Split fairly even between background mechanics and foreground engagement, GBQ contains enough slight modulations to semi-formulaic fare to keep things relatively worthwhile."
4,"Dirty, wonderful music","Some instances reflect the way of making music of the components of the band, but results are very impressive. A new way for making music a' la Waits.Very interesting"
3,Slightly overindulgent stuff but not bad,"OK this is the equivalent of a 70's supergroup. Take some famopuos musicians, one of which is even a legend (The Clash's Simonon) and let them indulge themselves. Granted it is not the catastrophic event it could have been, given that the production is not bad. Also they play skillfully with talent. It is dubby and kind of slow but in a beautiful way. The bass is very prominent given Simonon's presence. It is somewhat a logical extension of some of Albarn's ideas in Blur and Gorillaz but in a more relaxed mode."
2,"Good, Bad and The Average","I read a great review of this in a magazine and ordered it. THe article kept emphasizing beats and the way it was described sounded a bit more like electronica or housey rock. The lineup is impressive, I just found the songs kind of uninteresting and not nearly as original sounding as the review led me to believe. Even if 1 or 2 songs stood out it would be worth it, however that's not the case."
2,Boring,"I'm a HUGE fan of Albarn's. I even liked the Mali Music thing he did. I like Blur, and I thought the Verve finished with a bang. So, what happened? Who knows. All I know is they slept through this thing. Music is like comedy it's relative to the listener. Having said that, I don't know what my fellow reviewers were thinking when they slapped a five star on this thing. At best it's blah. I've listened to this thing ten times now. I do so only because, being a non-musician, it takes me a lot longer to hear the craftsmanship of an artist. Having said that, I usually think it unfair of me to judge an album on a few listens. After listen number 10, I'm done. Save your hard earned money and pour your precious time on other projects. It sounds like they did."
1,Biggest waste of time EVER,"Typically, when very talented individuals get together the old adage applies: the sum of the parts are greater than the whole. This does NOT apply to this album. It is the most useless, boring, irrelevant piece of drivel I've ever had the displeasure of listening to. Granted, I've typically loved everything Damon Albarn has touched and was therefore expecting the same level of awesomeness. If you buy this album expecting a Gorillaz or Blur album, you'll be as disappointed as I was. If you buy this album with no expectations whatsoever, you MIGHT (and that's a HUGE MIGHT) actually find some redeeming value to it."
1,Booooooooooring,"I was really hoping this would be good. Dude from Blur has been on a creative streak and now he's making and album with the bass play from the clash and Fela Kuti's drummer. But alas, it sounds like the boring, moody, skip-over tracks on previous Blur albums. (Think ""Death of the Party."") Some folks may really be into that stuff though. If you're one of them you'd probably like this. All I know is played this album aloud ONE TIME at work and four people told me to turn it off. (Shrug of shoulders, upturned palms and protruding upper lip.)"
4,Funny Fairy Tale,"This particular Tolkien's story might not be a classic but it is still a wonderful narration, full of comical characters. It is also accompanied by illustrations that might interest a child more in picking up the book to read. Compared to other Tolkien's writing, this is extremely brief. Tolkien was well-known for his vast imaginations and this yarn of his was another example of his ingenuity. Although the story line is brilliant, the language itself is not as beautiful or as smooth as other Tolkien's literary effort. Nonetheless, it is a humorous tale that brings smiles and laughter throughout all of the few pages."
4,Entertaining Fairy Tale,"This is the story of how a farmer (and his dog) defend their farm from ogres and dragons and the like, which propels them reluctantly to fame and riches. Filled with irony, humor, and good morals, (not to mention fairy-tale action) it is a story that shows Tolkien's lighter side.Farmer Giles of Ham is a fairy tale like story. It is rather short, and LOTR fans will find it lacking a lot of the depth Tolkien usually has. I would recommend it to a younger audience to get kids interested in his greater works. Still, it is pretty entertaining."
3,Patchwork leather,"Not a bad trenchcoat considering the price. I would have felt robbed if I had spent anymore than this. The description should have mentioned that this coat is made from patchwork leather. There were even a few moths having lunch on the lapel. The didn't eat much, I was able to disguise the small holes they left and kill the moths I found."
1,"Cheap, ugly, and excessively smelly","Do people care if it's patchwork leather? Absolutely. Most aren't rude enough to mention it because they're not the ones who have to wear the thing. When I received mine, the patchwork was a rude surprise not mentioned in the advertisement. It looks as if pieces of scrap have been sewn together. That's exactly what has been done. I'm not against scraps, but I don't enjoy my patchwork quilts in leather either thank you. The coat fit terribly and smelled absolutely atrocious. The new leather smell isn't very attractive to begin with, but I believe some excess sent must have been poured onto this coat. It was unbearable. I have never had that issue before. I donated the coat to the local high school drama department the next day. Given the price, I shouldn't have been such a fool and at least it was leather. I would still give it one star for that, even if zero were an option. This coat is baggy, ugly, and cheap looking, but You get what you pay for."
4,Taking Very Long to Ship,"Just wondering if anyone else had a problem with this item taking a very long time to ship out? I ordered a bout a week and a half ago, and it still has not even shipped. Thats the only real downer so far"
4,To the point?,"I found that this book gets to the point really quickly, maybe a bit to quickly! The author seems to cover every aspect of remote viewing but the instructions seemed a bit to rushed for me. The book did not dive into the science of remote viewing, so unless you have read lots about the human bioplasmic body, such as books on chakras and auras, you may not get as much out of the book as you could have. Also some of the stories are repetitious. Not a very well edited book. But it does seem to cover a bit of everything pertaining to remote viewing, and has lots of how to instructions, quick as they are. If the author ever writes an updated version of this book I hope he gets himself a good editor who could make this book more readable and usable, then he will get 5 stars from me."
2,A MUDDLE OF A BOOK,"This is a muddle of a book. Good sections on RV technique, that may or may not be fully grounded in experience and study, intermingle with preposterous accusations against MI5 in the UK and against the business elites that Rifat believes control the world.Rifat's bibliography is a puzzle. He doesn't refer to excellent sources that one would expect him to have used, or that he ought to wish to recommend to readers, and yet he cites Wittgenstein and Chomsky who are way off the subject.I don't find Rifats ""scientific"" explanations for RV, RI etc plausible.Where I suspect he is at his best is giving a relatively diverse set of protocols for types of mind-reach activities...but the weaknesses of his text detract greatly from those strengths.He seems more concerned to advertise or brag about his capabilities than to educate."
1,For purely entertainment purposes only!,"Rifat makes some amazing claims about super-duper secret soviet psi research facilities that, apparently, the US wanted to get intel on but couldn't. However, Rifat seems to have intimate knowledge of - although he never exactly explains how.Equally, he's an expert on US endeavors with RV. He did cite the Freedom of Information act as a vehicle for collecting the data on these programs; however, he never mentions what documents he found. There is a problem here. Most of the `good stuff' is still classified so it isn't available under the Freedom of Information act.I'm not sure how it's related but he somehow meanders onto various gov'ts use of Microwave technology to control the population - supposedly the soviets had satellites beaming us all into submission. And his issues with MI5; seesh!I would recommend this book for its comical value only."
1,Telepathic Hypnosis and Remote Killing !!,If you know anything about the subject of remote viewing this book might make you die laughing. One of the least informative. I have most of the books and have read much of what has been written in several years of study in the field and all I can say is don't waste your time or money.
3,"It is mildly amusing, but dry","I would not buy it, but I would check it out from the library.You can definitely tell that Tim Ferris ripped this book off for his 4 hour work week."
3,Parkinson's Law,I thought this book was good for people going into business. It was kinda confusing because of the examples the author decided to use.
2,Not as I imagined,"This book didn't have very good recipes. Nothing looked appealing. Returned it and still looking for a good, light, easy recipe book"
4,A darkness of the soul this way comes and with it death...,The poet has captured time in a bottle.Garcia Lorcia seems all frustrated love and sexual tension in a world unchangedfrom a middle age of superstition and ignorance.All small rooms in little sun baked houses with a peasant spirit and a gasping for free air...Bareness and large jealousy rule in what ends as small shriveled spirits bathed in blood.
5,Fantastic.,"This band is great, they don't seem too original, but then I can't think of anyone who sounds like them on the spot. They are very classifiable though, as they are rap metal with more melodic vocals than usual for the genre. Dont let the label fool you, though, some rap metal is quite bad (E town concrete), but this is awesome. This CD rocks hard all the way through, and there's even an epic on here (though its not the last track), in the form of Double Stakked (my favorite track). The singer's voice is pretty unique too. He's like Johnny Santos from Spineshank crossed with Kurt Kobain... interesting. Buy this if you want a great headbanger CD. Oh, and don't buy their second one, they turned into radio music... i wish great bands wouldn't do that... Taproot did it too."
4,Good Music!,"Nonpoint, a band that has traveled with ozzfest, and become popular without the held of much radio or mtv play, is definately a band to check out. Their music is a mix of sort of rap sounding lyrics in certain songs, and metal guitar playing in all. Sometimes they sound like RAtM, other times like a rocked out Sublime, but they definately have a music style that is much needed in today's ""Pop"" driven universe.Songs like ""what a day"" and ""endure"" are just some of the tracks that make this cd worth purchashing. The lead singer, has a wonderful voice, and is able to hit and octave he wants to make you get into the song.Whether the song is slow or hard, this cd should be liked by anyone in the Metal/Hard Rock universe. And yes they did play on ozzfest, so if they can impress Ozzy, they should be able to impress you, give them a try, i doubt you will be disapointed."
5,This band rocks!,"I have been a fan of Nonpoint locally and seeing their small underground concerts here in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, for about a year now. Anyone who considers themselves ""rockers"" or ""hardcore"" should definitely check this CD out. You won't be disappointed, it kicks @$$"
1,Below Average,"I will keep this short and sweet with my review of Nonpoint's debut. Check out What A day, Victim, and Mindtrip.The rest of this release pretty much blows. With what a day being the only real defining moment here."
4,wow,"Back in February, a close friend of mine had the Statement CD. He popped it in the CD player, and we were listening to it. I didn't think much of it, then I heard ""What a Day"" being played on the radio. I realized I really liked it, and ever since have been listening to Nonpoint. They are a great band. I really like ""Levels"", ""Endure"", and of course, I still love ""What a Day"". I recommend them to a lot of people, and I plan on getting my own CD here soon. Check 'em out!!"
2,.....,"Its no that nonpoint are a bad band or untalented, but its just that there is absolutly nothing new here. NOTHING. When someone asks you what a nu metal band is, you send them directly to this cd. Its just rehashed riffs and rapped lyrics....no real exciting breakdowns, if your just a beginner listening to metal then try this out, but everyone else, listen before you buy."
2,Difference does make a difference,"Ok....when I heard ""What a Day"" by Nonpoint on the radio a few weeks before I bought the CD... I was really looking forward to hear more songs by them. But then came the day that I bought it, and I regret wasting my money. Don't get me wrong...the music isn't bad... just the decision they made on their style. It was good for one of their songs...but not all of them. Every single song sounded like the previous one...and I think I would have liked it a lot better it there was a differentiallity in the tracks. So...if you want a cd that will have the exact (literally speaking) sound in every track...then this is the Cd for you. But if you are sane and you want some diversity in your music...then don't waste your money on this. It's like spending [money] on a Cd made entirely of numerous wanna-be ""What a Day"" songs."
5,"I dont give this 5 stars its more like 50, so buy it ;-)","Nonpoint, hmm how could i describe it, well everybody else says its like RATM, but its not really, it has it own sound (unlike what some others say, that its just copied from lots of other bands). Most of the songs sound the same, but thats the good bit, they have developed their own style, i dont reckon its rapcore, its NONPOINT!! I came across them accidently, i downloaded their videoclip (What a Day), and i was totally hooked. I listen mostly to death metal like Opeth and the like, but when i heard this, OMG I was baffled it was that good. My only regret is i didnt find them earlier. Their music is something you will (if you enjoy good sounding hardrock/middle rang metal) absolutely adore. Read the other reviews, even the ones that dont rate it a 5, they still think its good in some respects.Well thats it from BUSC on this. Drink Black Douglas, and listen to bands like Nonpoint, and life will serve you well ;-)."
5,great debut album,"I got this CD cause it seemed like (hed) PE fans enjoyed it (after all, they are touring with them). A while ago I saw them in concert and they were very impressive. You can tell they are a young band, but they can only get better from here (I would hope). Nonpoint are a very high energy band that will keep you entertained with their debut, Statement. It's one of the best CD's I've gotten in a while (and I have quite a few). The only way to compare them to any bands I would say that they are a cross between (hed) PE and maybe Godsmack... just get it already."
4,Original,"Nonpoint have a unique sound that sets them apart from others. The songs are catchy and easy to listen to over and over. Lyrically, their songs are original, which in many ways is very refreshing.The best songs on this CD are ""Mindtrip"", ""Victim"", ""What a Day"", and ""Back Up"". Pick it up if you are looking for something a little new and original."
4,Not your average band,"This CD is definitely not what I expected. I assumed another nu-metal band was on the scene and that it would be more of the same type of thing that was becoming standard issue for the genre. Statement has great elements that combine many different feelings throughout the album. Songs like 'Victim' and 'What A Day' just get stuck in your head. The choruses are all very catchy without being annoying. I think this band has great potential, and will be completely overlooked by the mainstream market. Do yourself a favor, pick up their CD and go see them live before they get really big."
2,"Great illustrations, Awful plot!",This book has very whimsical illustrations in a painted style. They help bring the story to life. Without the illustrations this story would not bring an interesting plot. This would not be a book that I would recommend because of the limited story line.
4,Purchased as a Gift,This was purchased as a gift for a person who has been a Genesis fan for a long time. He was VERY PLEASED when he received it.
3,Most of the book can be learned for free,"Prior to purchasing this book, I had gone through Macromedia's ColdFusion tutorials, WebMonkey.com's tutorials, and had gone through a short SQL tutorial at w3schools.com. The first four sections (13 chapters), chapter 14, and chapter 17 were encompassed by the free tutorials I had already taken. The next chapters are very good if you are want to customize Dreamweaver to increase your productivity. Instead of spending the [$$], you would be much better off taking the tutorials I mentioned and searching for a book a litle more advanced so that you don't have to read through the things you already learned in the tutorials."
4,Barre. Martin Barre. On Guitar.,"A fine debut from Martin Barre. The guitar work is flawless...as expected. As a vocalist, he is a great guitarist...which is to say his voice is not great, but it's good enough. Lyrics are good, although Trick of Memory reminded me too much One Slip from Pink Floyd. The instrumentals are great, the strongest part of the disc. This disc is a better selection than his follow-up, 'The Meeting.' Tull fans will not be disappointed."
1,Can you give ZERO stars?,totally worthless...stopped working after 3 weeks...will never buy another Sennheiser product again...don't waste your money...there are better headphones out there for much less than this pair...
1,fine for little heads who are allergic to bass sounds!,"I had high hopes for a decent pair of cans for under $50, but, alas, it's not these. First, they are TINY. Admittedly, I wear a 7 and 3/4 size hat, have been accused of having a ""fat"" head or a ""swell(ed)"" head, as it were, but golly, these cans were excruciating after 10 seconds of wear. On top of that, no discernible bass at all. I want a natural sound to monitor home recordings, so I'm not looking for super-brain-rattling bass, just a clean sound. These sounded like literal tin cans, emphasis on tin. I think you get the picture by now. My trustySony MDR-V150 Monitor Series Headphones with Reversible Earcups's (about $15 at Amazon) are infinitely better and even though they're not as comfy for my size head as I'd like, the sound is ideal and the fit much, much better than the Sennies. I returned the Sennheisers. I'll wait till I can afford $100+ for a real upgrade to studio-level cans. Happy listening and recording to all."
4,Pretty Good Headphones,"These headphones are a good deal for the $30. I use them extensively at work. They do a good job isolating the sound from white noise generators we have, and from people typing and talking. They sound great, however after about 2 hours or so I have to take them off since they tend to get uncomfortable (tight and warm). The sound quality is comparable to the KOSS KSC-75 headphones although at $12-15 those headphones are a steal. I have tried both at work, but the koss allow too much ambient noise in. Another good thing about the HD205 is that they do not leak a lot of sound, so others can't listen to what you are listening."
2,"extremely uncomfortable, but good sounds","these are extremely uncomfortable. It's too tight and will hurt the ears. However, if you're head is small enough, perhaps it might be okay. On the bright side, they sound extremely well."
1,One side did not work...,"Simply a failed product. When I received this product I could only get audio though one side. I tried multiply devices but to no avail. I had to contact the manufacturer, Sennheiser, and that was just pain in the ......."
4,Great headphones for home/office music producing/listening,"This headphones sound really great when making beats on my macbook, they also perform really well when watching movies and videos. They are not very comfortable at first, but they just need some stretching out. Also, they are not great for isolating you from outside noise, but do the job just fine when listening to my ipod. I have a pair of Ultimate Ears Super Fi 5 earphones that are more expensive and do not sound as well, I rather wear these any day. it is a great buy for the price."
4,great sound but uncomfortable after long periods of use,these are great headphones in terms of sound...but arent all that comfortable after long periods of use.
2,Bad for Classical - Spend Another $20,"These were a great disappointment given my experience with other Sennheiser products. The sound quality and imaging is maybe OK for pop, but dreadful for classical - piano is distorted and clangy, orchestras are muddled. In addition, the sound isolation is poor. I recommend spending another $20 and getting the HD428, another closed-ear model. You won't be sorry - much cleaner sound with less distortion, very easy to listen to for long periods."
4,Really impresive!,"This is probably one of the best, cheap, amazing headphones I ever bought. The bass is not that deep as other expensive models, but for what I paid ($19) is quite a deal! I would really recommend this product if you are looking for a cheap and good quality headphone's not made in china!"
3,you get what you pay for,"pros: good sound, cheap.cons: uncomfortable band that hurts your ears after a while."
4,Used for studio work,"I've just purchased a pair of these and have been using them for about a week now. I use them for mixing and mastering music in my studio. The sound quality is great; very clear and good frequency response. The 1/4"" adapter screws into the 1/8"" plug which is fantastic for what I'm doing. (I'm a little rough with cords when I'm working) They are a bit tight on the head and a bit small in the ears. I don't have a very large head or ears, so it doesn't bother me at all. In fact, it's nice to have them a bit tighter so I can thrash about and they won't fly off my head easily. I was a bit concerned about my ears hurting from the small cups, but I have not experienced any pain yet and I generally spend anywhere between 2 to 8 hours with them on. All in all, these are a fantastic deal for the price, but I wouldn't buy them if you've got yourself a decently-sized to a large head. Small heads only."
3,good for the price,"They are adequate. Nothing great, I wasnt blown away so to speak.About the headphones being too small, hmm dunno, I found them adequate, yes they are tight, but I having them looser would make them constantly slip from the head.Pros:1. Good ambient sound blocking. If you wear them without any music playing, it feels as if you have cotton stuffed in ur ears.2. Cheap3. Long cord. Nice carry pouch.4. solid contruction.5. Nice crisp sound output.Cons:1. The hollow spot at the center of the ear cup that is supposed to cover ur ear is small, about 1 1/2 inch by 3/4th inch. This puts some pressure on ur outer ear as the headphones fit quite snuggly. Extended use causes a bit of discomfirt.2. Sound is a bit flat for me. the bass wasnt deep and the trebles werent sharp enough. I need to play around with the equalizer to see if I can fix this."
2,"Good sound, terribly uncomfortable","Do not get these headphones, as they are way too tight. I have been using them for a month now, hoping they would break in more, but they have not. You can only have them on for 20 minutes or so before your ears hurt so bad you have to take them. Im not sure why they made them so tight, but they would probably best fit a 10 year old."
5,Great Headphones,"I own Sennheiser's 201, 202, 205, cx-200 and the cx-300. These hd205's, that I have owned for more then a year now, are by far the best sounding headphones of them all. The 202's would be next and then cx-300.Rich bass not overwhelming, they do not boom but they do hit hard. The highs are crisp. The mid-ranges are ok nothing special.Out of the box the hd205's are really tight ""on"" the ears to the point of causing pain after about an hour of use.I solved this by rolling up a towel slightly bigger then my head and putting the headphones on the rolled up towel overnight. Problem solved.Other Then that they are great......."
1,Meant for dwarfs?,"I thought I was going to love these headphones. Sennheiser has a reputation for great sound and the looked solidly built.... and then I put them on my head.I don't have a large head by any means, I wear a smaller sized hat. I literally can't wear these headphones for more than a few minutes without feeling major discomfort. They are abnormally tight!The sound quality was decent, mids and highs are crisp, bass is a bit lacking but not terrible. Ultimately how they sounds is irrelevant because I can't wear them! I purchased a pair of skull candies today and they are night and day more comfortable to wear.I'm throwing this pair of headphones in the garbage."
5,Best deal ever!,"I bought these refurbished for about 12 dollars after shipping. They were oficially factory refurbished, and they came sealed in a sennheiser package. The headphones are very comfortable, and seem very sturdy. They sound better than any other headphones i have ever bought. Amazing sound, even though they were very inexpensive."
4,"Very good, yet tight.","I just bought these today as a replacement for my 7 year old Sennheisers that were the on-ear type. These are very good if you have a computer with a good sound card, or onboard audio or a good mp3 player. But I do recommend having a graphical equalizer as these don't have much bass or treble by themselves. They are essentially studio monitor headphones designed to work with soundboards and digital editing software so it is expected that they are middle of the road without such additions. They are great when you use them with eq's and overall I like them. And they also keep out a decent amount of ambient noise, though not as much as Bose or Sony. Finally, as others have said, if your head is rather large, they could be far too tight for you. I would recommend the Sony BTDR50 Bluetooth headset as it is about the best you can find overall in terms of comfort, features and sound quality, though they cost between $100 and $300 depending where you buy them. But well worth it."
4,Very good for a little money,A litle bulky and tight at the beginning.Great sound but definitely not very portable.
4,Great sound,"Great sounding headphones for the price. The bass was a *little* distorted, but besides that, they sound great. Two or three people at my school have actually bought them themselves after borrowing mine."
2,"Great pair of headphones, or so I thought","I've been looking a while for the best pair of headphones for the price, and I feel like I found it with these bad boys. The sound quality is fantastic, bass works wonderfully. I must say though the cord length is a problem, but I improvised and tied the cord up to make is smaller. Also you may find them a bit tight at first, but within a few minutes it was fine. Now though, the headphones are acting up. Sound quality is basically gone. I had these since March of 2010 and had no problems until today (June 9th 2010). This is how I found out. My headphone jack was all the way in my Creative Zen, sound quality was bad, volume was low for how High I had the volume. Well I mess with it a bit, move the cord, sound quality is back to normal, but only for a bit, then I pull the jack out a little bit, that helps, but only until I put the jack back all the way in. I never dropped them or anything, I took the best of care of them, now they're junk."
2,Where is the Bass?,"I dont know the reasons Sennheiser had for built one set of headphones with none or minimum bass sound, but they should had pointed it in the description of the product, like ""Low Bass Response"".Feels like when you listen to music in an old radio and turn the bass down and the treble all the way up. My 10$ Sony Mdr-Ed12Lp earplugs has way more bass than this.If you enjoy good metal, progressive music and classic prog and alikes, you dont want this. this is for pop listeners fellas who barely care about the sounds been balanced enough to appreciate them individually, other than guitars maybe."
4,good for dj,its not the best yet but im really satisfied...and i recommend this for those who are looking for a not so expensive headphone...its great and affordable...
2,"Great Sound, Zero comfort","have it for a year or so... bought it to plug into a guitar amp... *really* uncomfortable. it's just too tight! so you can't wear it for too long... After half of an hour you'll need to rub your ears in order to regain blood flow. sound quality is very good, I have the PX100 for outdoor use, the quality is (a bit) better."
3,Too expensive,"I love sennheiser products and I saw a refurbished one on sale on amazon for $15 shipped. Definitely worth it for that price, the sound quality was pretty good but the headphones were too tight at first. One of the ears stopped producing sounds in about 7 month, and of course the warranty was expired. Overall, I wouldn't try the headphones unless it went on sale for refurbished at that price or lower, because for the same price new you can get a much better set of headphones in both quality of sound and comfort."
4,built like a tank,had these headphones for about 1 year nowi abuse them everydaytoo lazy to coil chord so its constantly being stepped on pulled yankedwhen im sitting on a chair i roll it over the chord so its now flat?im actually trying to break these so i can get new ones but manthey wont break!sound wise very good for their price good headphones to take around and bang up :)
3,"""Not as Clear As Needed, But Great Product for The Price""","Seller was Excellent, The Product (for The Price) was Excellent. I Have a Home based Recording Studio, and Really Would Like to Find a Pair of Professional, or Near Professional Headphones That Give Good Reference to The Voice, and That Are Very, very Clear. I'm Still Searching. I Have Added This Headgear to My Collection. Maybe One Day I will Get The Chance to Hear What The SennHeiser HD800 Sounds Like, Those Would Definitely Be On My ""Wish"" List."
4,very happy,"good stuff. They're only 30 bucks and they're excellent quality. The sound is very good, bass is great and even at max volume, and treble is excellent too. They're dj headphones, so they only have one wire coming from one side which is great and you get less tangles.The reason i took off one star though, is partly because the wire is ridiculously long for practical uses, but mainly because after around two hours for me, my ears start aching because the headphones fit so snug. The complaint about the wire really isn't a big deal at all and it can be a nice thing to have sometimes, but other times it can be a slight annoyance. I've only had the headphones for a few weeks, so it could be that i have to break them in a bit before they stop hurting my ears. It's a great product though, and easily worth the price."
3,Painful on the head,"Got these headphones extremely cheap on a sale. Ignored everyone's reviews that said the headphones were a pretty tight fit, and lo and behold.. they were extremely painful.The headphones are pretty good at this price level if you have a head the size of a small grapefruit. They fit on securely, are adjustable slightly, and have a swivel ear cup to confuse you if you knock into them at an odd angle.The durability is good, as they can take a beating, and they include a travel sleeve, which I stole to use for my other, better headphones I later purchased. My girlfriend also tried out the headphones, and agrees that they are painful to wear for more than a few minutes at a time. Have tried to stretch them out using a soccer ball, but to no avail.If you're looking for quality headphones, don't look at low end prices- you can find much better headphones used/discounted that are exponentially better than these ones."
3,Headband tight,"Still tight after use, otrwise ok. Have tried all ways of loosening, no luck. . . . Sound is very good"
1,Gross,I thought this would be a illuminating powder. Yet instead it's just a gross hooker-esque glitter. Threw it away after the first use
2,Plastic tore easily,I really liked this product for the one and only season I got to use it. I used bungie cords to keep it stationary on my deck. But the plastic tore and now the entire top is open to the elements. The zipper also seperated from the plastic in a short time from wind. It was really fun for the short time I got to use it. I would like to see a replacement cover available for the frame. I would really like that!
1,Portable Greenhouse.,The Rumford Gardener Portable Greenhouse #GH7500This greenhouse does not holdup to the sun. Plus the tubing had to be glued to make stay togeter. All the plastic covering came apart in less than one summer.
5,This is Great!,"I ordered one of these at the end of last season and couldn't wait for spring! It took about 10 minutes to set up - so easy and no tools! I haven't moved it outdoors yet as it's still a bit too frigid, but we have each shelf filled with trays of seedlings. Everything is coming up quickly and beautifully. I intend to move it outdoors soon and I am positive that I will remain pleased!"
2,The Rumford Gardener Portable Greenhouse #GH7500,This rack is not sturdy. Very frustrating that after the assembly the bars comes off the rack. I try to fix one and then the other shelves bars comes off. I am afraid that some of my pots will fall out and break. Not worth to buy this item. Maybe other products are better. I should have listen to the other reviews that it is flimsy.
5,JUST RIGHT!!,"I have looked for this in different places and found it on Amazon. Just set it up, start my seeds and can take it apart to store. JUST RIGHT!!"
5,One of the best anthologies ever published,"I'm beginning to suspect that the Kirkus review service pays its people by the mudball. Two of the stories in this book, Anderson's and Haldeman's, ended up in Dozois' ""Best SF of the Year"" anthology. Hardly a downcheck for the writing. For myself, I enjoyed the Anderson and Sheffield stories muchly for their breadth of scope and sense of the immense reaches of time that stretch before us. Most of all, however, Kingsbury's contribution is a dazzling, awesome, pyrotechnic refutation of the ironfisted tyranny that has always lain within the velvet glove of Asimov's ostensibly gentle ""psychohistory."" The book is worth its entire weight from this story alone. In addition, Haldeman's ""White Hill"" contributes tragedy of cosmically moving proportions. I purchased this volume in hardcover *after* reading it from my local library. That's not something I often do"
2,NOT LIKE PICTURE,the wheel cylinder is just a kit not the hole wheel cylinder like the picture with the bleeder that i need
3,autechre has some competition.,"this is a decent cd. if you like michael bolton's 1988 hit song ""time love and tenderness"" then you will love this album.(un)highly recommended."
3,The box needs work...,"No problem with the strings, they are a very good product. I had a problem with the box though. The low E strings were impossible to pull out one at a time. I ended up pulling out ALL the E strings (because I had no choice), and then coiling them and keeping them in little ziploc bags. Not exactly ideal. But the idea of buying strings in bulk is, if you own quite a few guitars (as I do), efficient and cost effective."
2,Cheap...,"...in price and quality. I bought several strands some worked fine, some didn't work well, and some didn't work at all."
5,Great,"I really like the lights. 50' gives me plenty of length to spread the lights from tree to tree to tree, etc."
3,Just a basic rope light.,"Purchased this a year ago and it's honestly nothing special. It's not exceptional quality but it comes with a large number of fasteners for hanging / tacking this to a surface. After a month, about 2 feet of the 48 feet don't work. You can't replace bulbs or sections, but the rest of it does still give off a gentle, yellow light."
1,Very dim and arrived broken,We bought these to go in our great room - there's a ledge near the ceiling where we had similar lights which had grown old and dim. These lights arrived with one section broken - about 3 ft didn't light at all. When we put them in the ledge they were so dark it was hard to tell they were on at all. They didn't create ANY indirect light in the room. I returned this 48 ft piece and a 12-foot piece the next day.
3,SECTION OF ROPE LIGHTING DIDN'T WORK....,After spending an hour or so to put the (extremely small and hard to work with)clips onto my deck rail I plugged the lights in only to reveal that the middle section of lighting did not work. It was too late to return product as it was for an outdoor party so I had to cover up the unlit area with a banner. Kind of expensive also...found 18ft of lighting at Big Lot for 5.99 ( and they all work!) Dissapointed!
3,Decent product,A lot of the lights were burned out. Every 3 or 4 feet there are spots that don't work. For the price I don't think it was that good of a deal. I bought some LED ones at Walmart that are far better.
2,Be prepared to return it a few times,"The rope has a few broken bulbs and a 5-6 foot section that is completely dead. It sounds like this is pretty common. For the price, its barely worth the harassement of paying for shipping back since the rope is fairly heavy. Save your time and money and buy a higher quality rope-light."
4,So far so good,"I've had the lights up outdoors for about a month. It's held up to some cold weather and high winds. In addition to the plastic mounting clips provided, I did reinforce the lights with insulated electrical staples. So far I'm happy with the product for the price I paid."
4,Great lights but some go out...,"I use these rope lights to illuminate hard to reach shelving in my garage--it lights great and is a relatively inexpensive solution...i use mine only indoors. Out of four long light ropes, a few lights in a single rope stopped working the first day. I have used them for more than a month now, and they others are all fine..."
4,Good Lights,"I have used these lights on my large back deck every night for over a year. In that time two sections have quit working but, the rest of the lights continue to burn well."
1,A do not buy item,"Product arrived in perfect manner. Looks better then expected.But, a section burnt out within my second day of use.Poor quality"
1,segment burned out in two months,Bought this in October for use under a patio canopy (outdoors but sheltered). But by December one three foot section had already burned out. Very disappointing.
2,First one not good1,The first one I ordered had many lights that weren't working. I had to send it back. The replacement they sent worked fine.
2,NOT AN LED ROPE LIGHT,This is an incandesecent rope light - NOT LED. Although the description doesn't claim it is an LED rope light - this was one of the top returns when I searched for LED ROPE LIGHT. That means the light is amber colored and it will get warmer and take more power than an equivilent LED rope light.
4,Great lights/Not so great mounting clips,"We put these rope lights around the fenced-in area of our pool and they emit just the right amount of light. Use the supplied mounting clips ONLY if you plan on never touching them or moving them. I replaced 75% of the clips within two weeks after installation with 3/8"" ID cable P-Clips."
1,disappointed in the quality,Good Earth Lighting 48'....we had two different 48' strands of the lighting fail!! I am very disappointed in the product.
3,The Cure is in the Cupboard,I think this book is more of a testimonial for the product. I really wanted a book with just facts. A few testimonials are ok but seems like this was more about the one product. Just my opinion.
2,Ebook poorly done,"The book was good and informative, however, the ebook was poorly laid out and pages were missing in one section of the book. There is no way to look up the remedies needed in the appendix. I intend on getting the physical copy which is much cheaper and easier to navigate"
1,"The book is great, but the Kindle version is terrible!","This book is informative and eye opening. Great info. The ebook on the other hand is horribly done! It's so full of mistakes that portions of it are literally unreadable! And it is extremely difficult to find specific sections on how to treat the conditions it discusses. For instance, if you want to know how to treat a fungal infection, there are too many responses when you do a search for it, the index is completely useless, and the table of contents (which you can't even link to directly) is almost completely useless. After all that you'll need to find out how to treat a headache, but you can't! I have encountered similar problems w/ other Kindle books, but I excused it because those books were free. I can't believe I paid ten bucks for this nonsense! What a shame to do to such a good book."
5,ONE of the BEST Finds to date - Positive results,"Recommended by a friend, was somewhat skeptical at first with such a basic product and the suggested benefits it brings out. A helpful, quick read full of great information. It was convincing enough that we purchase the product it speaks about and recommends.WOW, we have found something that has benefited our family immensely. From a personal tooth ache that went away within minutes to a topical covering and healing agent for the skin. Many, many uses and were find more as we use this unique oil. We don't gravitate to all the hype and fads thrown our way and there are so many. It was refreshing to find a well laid out option and wealth of resources. Read it for yourself and see what you think. I think you'll like what you find - in the cupboard."
2,Is the cure in the cupboard?,"After searching for this book for over a month I finally received my copy and set out to study all about the Oregano in my cupboard. Much to my surprise before even finishing the introduction Dr. Igram disclaimed the whole title with a statement the Oregano that we can purchase at the grogery or health food store was not acceptable. ""In other words , whatever the supermarket has on its shelves or whatever the health food purveyor might provide, it isn't medical grade oregano: period. Such products will not and cannot exhibit the curative effects described in this book."" Mr Igram then goes on to promote a obscure company as the sole source for the oregano that works. If you decide to call the 800 number listed be prepared to shell out around a hundred dollars. Overall the book could have been a lot of fun and quite a help for home remidies. The only problem is I don't know and he didn't tell me what this stuff in my cupboard should be."
2,oregano oil smells bad & it lingers.,i can't get past the smell of the oregano oil to know if it works & neither can anyone else in my house. so i don't know if it would work
1,Bogus,"What a lie... the first thing this book tells you is that the title is a lie! It tells you in the first chapter that the spices in your cupboard are NOT the kind that carry ""the cure"". do not waste 2 cents on this book"
5,Effective,"My wife does not believe in herbal remedies, however she will occasionally try something I suggest because she hates to go to the doctor even more. Unfortunately she is prone to bladder infections and generally has had to go to the family doctor to get an antibiotic, but only after she has suffered for days.I had purchased some oregamax capsules and the last two times she has started to get the symptoms of her bladder infection she consented to try them. She experienced relief virtually overnight on both occassions."
5,Oregano oil book,"Got there on time. Recipient not there for 2 weeks yet, so hasn't seen it. Recipient is out of town till July 15."
1,Sorry to say it did not work for us,"This book promises many cures for many symptom, however in my and my son's case it just did not work. The first problem was sore throat which continued. Second problem we tried to cure was acne. My son tried using oregano oil under his tongue and as topical to the acne. All that did was make his acne really red and he actually broke out even more. He continued with it for two weeks and we gave up and brought acne-free product. I had only one pimple which was large, I also applied oregano oil on it. It became larger and really red. It has been over 2 months and that old pimple site still has a red mark on it. I have been really disappointed with his book and his product sorry to say I was really looking for a cure."
3,It's okay!,It sez that I have to use twenty or more words in this block and I truthfully don't know what else to say - It's okay!
2,Okay but not what I was looking for...,I received better information from my friends who have used oregano oil. I was disappointed in this book...it was a waste of my money. I could have gotten as much information on line or from friends for free!
1,Questions,"I originally bought this book and a bottle of the recommended oil of oregano because I had heard about it from another person. I wanted to believe that the claims were true. The book contains no information about the author. Also, there are no footnotes or bibliography to back up any of the health claims for wild oregano.I went looking online for more information about the author and about oil of oregano. What information I did find was not encouraging. However, I did use the entire bottle of oil of oregano as instructed in the book. During the weeks I was using it, I noticed no difference whatsoever in any way. I would like to give the benefit of the doubt but am finding that difficult..."
5,the color of love,this is a great book and i appreciate the quick delivery time that i recieved it in.
4,"Sad, yet very truthful",I thought that this book had a lot of truth to it. It was a book that struck the heart.
4,Book Review,"I think this book Escape from Warsaw is beneficial to a middle school audience. This story is well paced, has understandable words, and is appropriate.This book has an intreging introduction. It gives backround on what happened before the book took place. This is very helpful to know what is going on in the book.This book also has a capturing rising action. When the children in the book find a boy that could help them, it is very suspenseful waiting to figure out what is going to happen next.Escape from Warsaw has a very suspenseful conclusion as well. The children are so close to finding what they are looking for, and then a storm hits.I think this book has a strong plot. It is easy to follow and you can really understand what is going on. I would reccomend this book for middle school students."
4,Very Good Book. Excellent for young children.,I'm only 12 and my mom read this book and got it for me for english class. It's not an incredibly good book but it was good for what I needed. Not real detailed on the camps but good for young children first learning about the holocaust. A little boring at times ends happily (almost too much so). I would definitly reccomend it.
3,Escape From Warsaw by Cody,"The book was about a family of five that gets separated during WWII and how they fight to survive. The mom was taken by the Nazi's to Germany to work in a factory the dad was taken to a concentration camp and the kids were left to fend for the them selves. The book was alright, it wasn't my favorite book but I would recommend it to anyone."
5,super like super man,I like this book because it was about a family of kids 3 of them and the army killed there mom and put ther father in jail then they live in this shake and the girl teaches the lost kids and the bolder brother gets food and a job and the little brother stays with the sister and they meet a kid that has a animal and the intersting part is that throgh out the book they are looking for there da and there is alot of action and advanture and i would give this the highest rating even thugh it was boring at first
3,Escape from Warsaw..,"I just picked up this book from the other day and finished it within few days. Escape from Warsaw (original title: the silver sword), a story of a family whose father decided to make fun of Hitler and was later captured by the Nazis and sent to a concentration camp. This left the children on their own to escape the war-torn city of Warsaw. The book itself did not live up to the expectations, or at least to me it didnt . The author's narrative skills are very linear and so is the story which is taken from real accounts. Despite the linear story and writing style, the book manages to keep my attention with the real to life characters. It is what kept me interested until the end of the book. The plot itself was predictable and is not very intriguing. Overall, mediocre at its best. All i can say is that, i wouldn't have read this book if i had the option not to."
5,Escape From Warsaw,"This story is taken from real events, from real families, that see first-hand what war can mean. As a kid watching war happen over in Iraq, it was good to read this book and see through it all there was hope. Hope for freedom, family, and peace. Looking at daily survival through the eyes of kids really makes you think if what is happening in our world is right. The Balicki's story will stay with me for a long time!"
4,An Extremely Full-filling Read!,"I read this book when I was in sixth grade and Nancy Drew didn't cut it anymore. I think this should be on a standard reading list of some kind for young adults to read to help them realize, although the book is fiction, what the war was like for children in other countries. Even though I wasn't alive during the war, I still feel compassion more now than then."
4,Very cute,I got this book for my new puppy and it had been alot of fun going through it and looking back and some of the fun things she did in her first weeks with me. Great gift idea for new pet owners.
2,Good only if you're a newbie,"This book is good ONLY if you're a newbie. If you're in the field, save you're money and buy something with some teeth to it. Such as, Hacking Exposed. The title itself is very misleading. There is no Pen testing. Unless you get all the tools they talk about and launch an attack. The authors are also a little biased on their choices of tools. I can think of better tools to use, in some situation, then what they suggest. All-in-all, it's just an OK book, if you're new...really new."
4,"Akil's review of ""Hack I.T."" - Newcomer's paradise","A Class piece of literature. Well-written, by guys who obviously have experience of both hacking, and Security Consultancy. I consumed the 500 pages over a marathon four days. It was well worth the hours I put aside for this task.The book has a nice 'human' touch, and makes the reader very aware of the expectancies of corporate clients (those that may employ 'Penetration Testers').Many of the links to 'tools' are no longer up, but there are many alternatives (as a simple google search will reveal). And of course a CD is included with the book to get you up and running in terms of some basic tools.This book is a 'must-have' for guys (like myself) new to the Security/Penetration Testing field. Great work Klevinsky/Laliberte/Gupta. Give us more!!!"
2,Waste of money,"This book only tells a few methods on actually getting in, and is basically useless. Get a better book."
4,Hack I. T.,"This book is an overall well rounded view of the methods that can be used for PEN testing. Although it does have for examples some ""dated"" material (backdoors, etc.), it makes up for this in shear volume, utilizing ideas from different OS's. It is also an easy read, but I was a little disappointed in some of the visuals such as Figure 1.1 (Hard for my eyes to see the Hacked sites in the Hacked site list). This is a 2002 book. Hopefully,the authors will have an updated version soon. On a side note, an associate of mine had the pleasure of meeting Simple Nomad (forwarded this book) at DEFCON, said he's a likable guy."
2,"Druillet good, programming and support bad.","This is a foreign game, from DCE games in France. The English dubs on the entrance has been too late 2 out of 3 times of starting new games -- in an attempt to get around a bug I encountered in the first chapter.If you have technical issues, support is next to impossible to find, especially in English. Don't let their English counterparts fool you - The Adventure Company and DreamCatcher Interactive do not support the game! Hello, links to bitty web-sites with too little information and links to ""Technic Support."" The patch was hard to find, and it still didn't fix my bug.It's also: fishbowl view, and mouseclicks only, with no alternate option for keyboard controls. Double-clicking usually also requires you to be perfectly centered if you want to enter a new area, so be prepared for quadruple-clicking or more.While Phillipe Druillet's artwork is great, a couple of puzzles were new, but overall, with its bugs and difficult support, I wish I'd passed."
4,Excellent LaPlante creation,"As always, Lynda LaPlante has created a compelling and intriguing show--characters are great and plotlinesare never predictable which is a wonderful attribute."
2,Not so good,"I liked the first two seasons of ""The Commander"" but as the series roled on, Amanda Burton seems to play her part with more disdain. She seems pretentious. I've come to dislike her character. It could be the writing, or the director or the actress. I just seem to dislike her more and more. I don't know too many people who would like this woman, if she were real."
5,Bear Daughter's Long Shamanic Journey,"I really liked this book and identified with the theme and action. I have been studying shamanic texts for about20-25 years, and this author (who is an anthropologist) really knows her stuff. You can hardly put the book down, and the story seems much like a long shamanic journey having to do with redemption and ancestorhealing. I was somewhat put off by the gore and violence when it occurred, although I also felt it was probablyin keeping with the time setting of her novel. I have recommended it to many of my friends and fellow practitioners. I hope Judith Berman will continue to write more of these wonderful stories! Cheers for her firstfictional endeavor!"
2,Novel Length N. American Legend,"""Bear Daughter"" reads like a novel length myth/legend from one of the North American indian tribes. A girl (who was born a bear) upon turning into a human is taken in by her grandmother. Her step father violently opposes the bear-girl's existence, and forbids the mother any contact. His disapproval eventually forces her to flee the villaige. Much of the plot centers upon the bear-girl moving from one community to another, loosely tied together by a quest to save her siblings' and father's gosts.I'm fond of myths and legends. My problems with this book is the atmosphere -- the bear girl is constantly mistreated, everywhere she goes, and this gets old, fast."
3,a little bit disappointed,I was a little bit dispointed when I didn't expect that kind of texture due to the picture
3,Not Exactly Zao's Finest,"When people say this is Zao's best album ever, it's because they know absolutely nothing about Zao. I'll admit, some of the good songs are GREAT songs (5 Year Winter, Trash Can Hands), but this just isn't a GREAT album. There are too many instrumentals; The End Of His Life has a hip-hop style chorus, which reeks; At Zero has amazingly fast drums, but they get completely out of sync with the song; and a few songs are a little bland for my taste. A much less palatable CD compared to their other stuff. I enjoyed it, but I often find myself skipping a few songs each time I listen to it."
4,Brandon Lunsford's mom rocks like this album,"This album is nothing exceptional, but Brandon Lunsford's mom was TRULY exceptional. Wowzers. Keep in touch, Miss L!Love,Zao P.S. Tool blows like your mom."
4,"Ok, just Ok","While ""5 Year Winter"" and ""Trashcanhands"" are the highlights of the CD, songs like ""The End of His World"" make you say why. I didn't really like the move to electric drums even though Jesse is still a beast."
5,experimental zao,"I just bought this cd from a kid at my school for 8 bucks, it was a deal i couldnt refuse, cause Zao kicks ass! So I started listening and I noticed in this cd, they are using and trying different instrumental elements ....but you know what?? ITS AWSOME, it still have the same impact as the other cd. And on some of the songs, showing Zao's more lighter side. But then blasting you with Zao's awsome hardcore rants....This cd is excellent, Zao has never made a bad cd, even if it's right in between band member switches. THIS RULES! If you're not really into zao's experimental cd, then try ""Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest"" and their new one, Funeral Of God.....bottom line, ZAO RULES"
2,What Happened?,"""Blood and Fire"": no comparison whatsoever in the metal-core genre. ""Liberate"": Excellent emotion and instrument work and great vocals. Little less on the lyrics.Now we have ""Self titled"" the lyrics on the first song are great for a song to give to a person you had a messy breakup with. Then you have the rest of the album...major disappointment. This not what Zao should be like. I know bands should try experimentation and all that. I'm not against it. but when it sounds this bad...well, you get this kind of rating. A two out of five."
4,Good metal. Period.,"It's good to hear ""Christian"" Metal that isn't all ""love Jesus or go to hell."" Good songs, both musically and lyrically. The slower songs are the best to me."
4,Not To Bad At All,"Ok ZAO is one of the most talented bands ever and pretty much the fathers of modern metalcore. Every album they put out is going to have something good and note worthy on it, but keep in mind no one's perfect. I do agree that this one is not ZAO's best CD and it marks the first time where they departed from their more basic sound to experiment a little bit and for what it is I think they did a great job. Dan is still at the top of his game on this album along with his amazing lyrics. There are some great guitar riffs and solos on songs like 5 Year Winter that leave you in awe, then the drumming is a lot faster and intense then previous albums. I would put this album after Blood and Fire, Liberate and Funeral of God for quality albums, but this is still an album ZAO fans can be proud of, I think their expreiment works here, it's not until their next album where they go a bit too far."
4,A good album from a great band.,"If this was anyone else, but Zao, I'd give this CD 5 stars. But being that I don't believe its quite as good as liberate te ex inferis (5 stars) or Where blood and fire bring rest (6 stars) I'll give it 4. The album much more melodic and different in parts then any previous effort. Check out ""witchhunter"" for a taste of a few of the songs. Only towards the end does the album take on that 'epic' quality that ""where blood and fire"" had.Great CD, I hope they continue putting out music for a long time to come. Zao was my first hardcore concert and if I had my way they'd play at my funeral and be my last."
5,NYPD Blue rules,An Awesome book its just like watching the show. It felt good to see Bobby back in action after he died. It's hard and raw its gritty. The book has a few plot twists its a great read.
4,Visual aid for the serious student,"If you just look through the list of topics, you would appreciate how much material has been condensed into this small-sized volume. It is comprehensive in scope. Each topic is complemented by a beautifully designed color-plate--193 in all. It takes much hard work to work through the book. It is best used as an aid to many fuller texts or for review. I hope the material can be developed into a video series like The Universe Within: the Human Genome, or a 3-D CD-rom. Then it will be such a blessing to all students of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology."
1,Wayne Check Valve for Sump Pump,"Bought a Wayne Sump Pump and also a Check Valve.Amazon ad said that the Check Valve works for a 1-1/4"" or 1-1/2"" discharge...but it is ONLY for a 1-1/4"" discharge...looked at what was in the box and NO ADAPTER to attach the check valve to the pump for 1-1/2"" discharge...read the directions and it does not fit a 1-1/2"" discharge!!!After paying for 1-day delivery and getting it 6-days later...bearing in mind that I am HAND PUMPING my sump this whole time...you can imagine my disappointment when it showed up and did not fit the pump!!!If Amazon is going to sell sump pumps then you need to accurately identify which check valves fit each pump AND mark the check valve size accurately...FYI it was a 1-1/4"" check valve with an ADAPTER to fit a 1-1/4"" pipe or a 1-1/2"" pipe...I gave this order a MINUS-5 STARS."
2,Very frustrating to use,"I bought one of these when I installed Pergo in my house to do the trim. It was very frustrating to use. First off, it's very hard to use if you are just placing it on the ground. Although it's hard to tell from the picture, it's got an L shaped base that's meant to mount on a bench. If you use it on the floor, the cutting surface is at an angle. Also, I found I frequently ended up cutting into the plastic of the box. The wallbase I was using was too tall to fit in the box upright, so I had to do the 45 degree cuts using face cuts. The saw would really squeek on these cuts. I ended up buying a better Craftsman miter saw, and only wish I'd done so sooner.This miter box might be alright if you just have to do a few cuts and want to save money, but if you have to do any significant amount of money, save yourself the frustration and spend your money on something better."
4,Bargain,"The Stanley 20-600 mitre box and saw is a good deal for the price. I've used mine for lightweight work on molding trim pieces and baseboard quarter-rounds. I found this product was easy to use and got the job done. The mitre box has a lip on the bottom of one edge so you can brace it against the edge of a table, keeping it from sliding away from you. The included cams allow you to clamp your piece into place. I found that the cams alone were not sufficient to hold the small trim pieces I was working on, but the combination of my free hand and the cams made keeping the pieces steady a breeze.The included back saw is not a masterpiece of a hand tool, but seems more than adequate for light duty use. The 20-600 features a clever design that prohibits the saw blade from making contact with the base of the mitre box, so you can saw completely through your target piece without cutting into the plastic base."
2,So much promise. So much disappointment.,"I was very happy to find this combo since it was exactly what I needed. However, it is almost unusable since the thin plastic moves around so much while sawing. Saw does not seem to bite well either. Took surprising effort to saw through quarter round stock. A lot of thoughtful touches went into this which makes it all the more disappointing that the execution is so bad. Returning for something of better quality."
3,"Good saw, but the rest is a cheap plastic","The saw is good, but the rest is simply very light plastic, my son thought that it is a toy for him. It is good for a low duty small home project"
2,Works but Not Very Well,"I picked up this mitre box and saw at the local home-improvement store over the weekend. It's a cheap product and it shows when using it. The plastic body of the mitre box is quite mediocre and flimsy. The saw is serviceable, but I've had mitre saws in the past that worked much better than this. The clamps are pretty worthless. I recommend paying more for a better combo. I'm surprised at the drop in quality of these Stanley tools, but they are being manufactured in Asia these days."
3,It's just ok.,Well I used it to cut a few things that were small because I didn't want my fingers anywhere near my power Miter saw. I cut them and the accuracy was reasonable for the price. Think it would be a better deal if it was around $10. I'll probably use it only when I have something small to cut.
5,exactly what he needed,"My husband needed a smaller mitre box for a job here at the house, and when he got it, he was tickled to death! It was exactly what he needed for an extremely reasonable price. Thank you."
1,ZERO stars for junk,"I used to buy Stanley stuff for years but the fact they had the Chinese stamp/mold ""STANLEY"" on a worthless POS miter box like this one makes me pause on buying anything else from them. I guess they let the communist Chinese do their design work as well as manufacture.The saw gets bound up in the slots and the saw is a POS as well. DO NOT BUY!"
3,For Die Hard Sid Fans Only,"This album is a collection of live tracks performed by Sid Vicious live at Max's Kansas City. There are two shows represented here with little in the way of difference between the two. Between tracks there is some heckling and a few snide remarks from Sid. The songs are performed poorly, both musically and vocally, but hey... you would buy this because your a Sex Pistols/Sid Vicious fanatic anyway right? A must have for Sex Pistols/Sid Vicious fans, but generally a very poor recording."
3,Sid Vicious - 'Sid Vicious Live' (Anagram) 3 1/2 stars,"Appears to be two gigs, recorded live at Max's Kansas City club in 1978 - both shows have {virtually} the same track listing. Didn't think this live CD was as bad as some insist that it is. Sound quality is almost as good as one could expect. Liked hearing the late Sid Vicious belt out tunes like the Stooge's ""Search And Destroy"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" as well as the New York Doll's ""Chatterbox"", Sex Pistol's rocking ""Belson Was A Gas"" and ""No Lip"". Nothing great to experience here, but a somewhat historic recording to check out."
4,priceless and pitiful,"Of course we know how the story ended so it's not funny, but Sid's mumbled ""I've forgotten the rest"" at the end of his cover of My Way is priceless."
4,"Ok Energy, Great Taste, Expensive Ship","I liked the taste, it was very convenient to use but I only felt a mild energy push. Overall better tasting than the caffeine gum but too shipping and the overall results makes it not worth the trouble. Coffee is cheaper and can be adjusted."
2,Nothing..........,I noticed no change in taking two tablets at a time. I tried it a couple of times with nothing. I was hoping to get a little buzz after a couple of miles of jogging but it didn't affect me in any way. It tastes good but that's it for me. Your mileage may vary..
5,These things rock!,I dont like coffee or tea and am trying to get off soda so I purchased these. They're easy and convinient. They taste a tad gritty but I dont mind. I use a pill cutter to chop them in half so I dont always have to get 100mg caffiene. The flavor is good and they really perk me up. I wish they were more available!
5,AMAZING! Fav Source of Caffeine!,"LOVE IT! These guys are genius, hilarious, and really good with CAFFEINE! Not only is that my favorite word, but also my favorite dietary supplement... it's a frequent inhabitant of my bloodstream :) I think they made the right choice to not reduce the energy-ingredient amounts just for the taste.... wimps can get over the slight bitterness! 100mg of Caffeine... that's about a cup of coffee in just one (large) mint! FOOSH is AMAZING, and I plan to continue purchasing these delightful and fun mints, which help me survive the day!"
4,"pleasant, portable caffeine delivery system","Great to have around when you're in a post-lunch meeting that you really need to stay awake for. A bit too large to pass for a breath mint, but it is pretty low-key and easily carried with you. It works well, and is more easily gotten to than a cup of coffee (which I don't drink anyway) or an energy drink.I have trouble using it sublingually, because they're a bit large for the space under my tongue (I have a fairly small mouth)."
3,The English censors felt compelled to cut 29 of the 86 minutes of this film...,"Bardot was the newly discovered teenager, the rebel against strict bourgeois upbringing, the woman who takes her pleasure with whom she chooses, and follows her own inclinations and desires...By the time Bardot's second film, ""Manina, la fille sans voile"" was released in 1952, the blushing teenager had fallen by the wayside; instead there emerged a brave, wilder girl, liberated from the repressed rules of society...The eroticism displayed by Bardot throughout this film was undeniably challenging, though the fashions may seem rather absolute today...The impact she made may be measured by the fact that English censors felt compelled to cut 29 of the 86 minutes of this film..."
4,Those French have different words for everything...,"I really enjoyed this movie even though I can't understand a word of French, Bardot speaks the universal language. While it has an interesting storyline, I cannot recommend the use of subtitles, they interfere with seeing Brigette! Very well filmed in black and white."
5,"Oh, it really is just like eating Grand Marnier truffles....","""Who needs Webster's? This dishy dictionary is so much more fun!"" --Cosmopolitan.Well, I had to check it out, and for the price I would say it is the best little book out there as a gift to any girlfriend or guy friend who wants to see how the other half thinks. A surprisingly gifted array of writers contributed to this -- and how wonderful that they did. Many,many laugh out loud passages and more than one enlightening moment. Just a delight!"
3,More of the Same Chick Lit,"OK. Enough. Enough of the never ending whine emitting from women, (smart, clever, savvy women) on the landscape of literature. OK, you were hurt. We've all been there and, unfortunately, may be there again. The stories in this ""dictionary"" (a big whatever) are entertaining, somewhat enlightening and well written. Check out Jennifer Weiner's piece about her father, amazing. However, Broussard's (editor) revenge is best served cold. It, too, is well written and humorous on certain levels but, all over the biggest and most annoying whine in this anthology. Come on, ladies. Use the talent and brains for some growth. I imagine, once the glut of Chick Lit has had its day, that many of the women in this anthology will remain on the literary lanscape and will contibute terrific, enlightening literature."
1,"Im sorry guys, dont' buy it","I bought this book because I thought it would be funny and well, good. Im sorry to say, it's weird. And I've never written a review of any book before so I don't mean to be rude, but these stories are just way too abstract and so far from the point. Most of them don't even tell what happen in the relationship but rather what happened in the girls mind. There are a couple worth reading but you could just thumb through it on the shelf. If you're looking for a good cry or laugh, this book won't give it to you. This book is simply filled with a lot trying to be too good writers instead of just telling what happened with the realtionship. Ok, Ok, I'm not a writer, but I honestly was excited to sit and read this book and lighten my mood and it just flopped. I would not recommend it."
1,"more tall tales, where's the info?","I was not impressed. there is very little useful information in this book, mostly just a bunch of tall tales written to impress inner city folks who have never gotten a chance to experience the outdoors. Don't waste your time or money with this book. Field guide to mammal tracking in north america by jim halfpenny is the book you want. Allan a macfarlan is another author i recommend looking into, he has written about the same subject but has more detail."
5,Exiting!!!!!!!,"This book gave me a renewed enthusiasm for nature and an urgent need to be outdoors, I wanted to do everything he was teaching as I was reading it. I went right out and practiced his techniques as soon as possible during and after reading this book. I've never seen so much wildlife as I do now. It has made me a better outdoorsman and has given more meaning to my time spent outdoors. I can't wait to share it with my father who taught me some basics of tracking when I was a boy. This book taught me all the stuff I wished I had learned long ago, now i must make up for lost time I spent with my eyes closed to the things that connect me with the earth."
5,Great book for anyone interested in tracking.,"This was the first book that I had ever found on tracking. It does a great job of teaching tracking fundamentals and enviromental awareness. Not enviromental awareness in the Greenpeace definition, but in being aware of what is going on around you. I lent it to a friend once and just about had to wrestle it out of his hands after a couple of months to get it back. It is a great book, well worth the money, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in tracking and observing nature. Some chapters include: Fine-tuning the senses; Movement and Camouflage; Animal Higways and signs; ""Aging"" Tracks and Signs; Reading and Following Tracks; and Search Tracking."
2,There are better,"An o.k. introduction to the subject, I suppose, but there are better on tracking itself, such as James Halfpenny's A Guide to Mammal Tracking in North America, which simply presents serious, hard information, and outstanding illustrations, on family and species track characteristics, gaits and interpreting them, etc., without the mystical mumbo-jumbo of Brown's book(s). This book will help you become more aware of nature, as did the several courses I took at Brown's school in the early '80s, but I have since become very skeptical of much of what Brown has said and written. (And compare the illustrations of tracks in Brown's book to the illustrations in Murie's A Field Guide to Animal Tracks, from Houghton Mifflin, published earlier.)"
4,"A good book, but not my first recommendation of his books","a good book about how to really see things in nature, not just the obvious. it also goes into some of the basic and more technical aspects of tracking people and animals.however, i felt that it was to much in the middle of basic tracking and very technical tracking. personally if you want the basics of tracking i would buy his book entitled ""Tom Brown's Field Guide to Nature and Survival for Children"". this lines out basic tracking skills very well so that a child can understand, but i have found it very helpful in my practices. And if you want very technical tracking advise i would get his ""Science and Art of Tracking"" book.And pretty much all of his books go through some nature observation guide. this one just has a lot more excercises for practicing it."
5,very good; a textbook to back up his live trainings.,"This book is very useful. It has numerous good ideas. I have done several courses with Tom, which I have to say were far, far better than anything the military offers. I met an instructor from the SERE course, at a Brown training, he was smart enough to be out improving himself. Tom calls himself a ""coyote teacher"", and is somewhat incomprehensible at times, and at other times is strikingly lucid, with a great message. No teacher knows everything.Journey to the Ancestral Self: The Native Lifeway Guide to Living in Harmony with the Earth Mother (Bk.1)was written by a former instructor at Brown's school, and it fleshes out some of what Brown says.Tracking and the Art of Seeing: How to Read Animal Tracks and Signis one of several tracking books that are useful.Shadow Strategies of an American Ninja Masteralso covers information that would be useful, as you expand your skills."
3,Got no zing 'cause it ain't got that swing,"I was very disappointed with this album. I considered Zoot Suit Riot to be a stylistic masterpiece, one of the most original works I had heard in quite a long time. While this album often shows flashes of brilliance, it is not up to that level. Stylistically, it meanders all over the landscape. Furthermore, the wry wit and edgy insights into the darker side of human nature are almost totally missing. Finally, it is not produced to quality of their previous offerings. The horn section often sounds muddy and obscured, and the guitar work is uninspired. I really wanted to love this album, and I just didn't."
2,could have been better,"I went to a recent show and was so disappointed. They played swing numbers but acted bored. then they played the new stuff. I know they were punk before swing but they crossed over to a more jazzy world. They should have stayed. what they are playing know does not give good credit to the horn players in the band which are more or less drowned out but the drum guitar and keyboard. It was said to see the number of people walking out of the show we were at. Hopefully they will come back around to the jazz side of music where they shows the bands talents not the drummers, guitarists and keyboardist talents."
4,A Great CD from CPD,"First: The Cherry Poppin' Daddies, although came to the forefront with Zoot Suit Riot, are not a swing band. They are a retro-swing-disco-funk-pop-metal-jazz band. And with Diamond Light Boogie, the lead song on this offering, they've added a touch of seventies glam rock.Second: Buy this CD. It is not their best, but it is a darn good representation of the band. (My personal fave is their first release, Ferociously Stoned).Enjoy!"
1,They changed their style!!!!,"I really anticipated this follow-up album. I really enjoyed their previous work. However, what is with the mix of styles? I expected swing!"
5,Bring Back The Cherry Poppin' Daddies!!!,"First off, the CD's title is SOUL CADDY. As in ""cadillac."" Got it? Good. Now on to the review!If I could give this CD an infinite number of stars, I would. This CD is like all the other Cherry Poppin' Daddies CDs -- it's GOLDEN! The intelligent lyrics by M. C. Large Drink hisself, Steve Perry (no, not THAT one!), and the extremely gifted muscians make this CD one to listen to over and over again. Not only can they swing, they can do fabulous, heart-melting slow numbers (""The Saddest Thing I Know""), hard rockin' songs (""God Is A Spider,"" ""Bleeding Ceremony""), and twangy rock-a-billy (""Uncle Ray"").And for the zooty people out there, there are TWO swing numbers on this hot disc: ""Swingin' With Tiger Woods"" and ""So Long, Toots.""Listen to this CD. Then go listen to all their others (I know you will). And join me in worshipping the Cherry Poppin' Daddies and their singer and lyricist, Steve Perry (M. C. Large Drink)! Let's bring back the Cherry Poppin' Daddies!!"
3,Not as swingy as they used to be,"It's angrier, with a departure from their usual swing which I found rather disappointing since I was waiting for this CD for a while. It just seems like they're in a transition stage when listening to this CD, just wondering what their next CD would sound like."
4,diabet-x!,This product really works on dry and cracked fingertips.I have tried many products but after using this product for three days my hands and fingertips were completely healed.
4,Interesting Read,"I would say this is a must for big fans of Robert Jordan. It was not the best artistry (I think the subject matter made that difficult, how exactly do you draw ageless?)but it was really cool to see everything you have imagines come to life visually.I enjoyed it."
3,"Strong Start, Weak Ending","This book starts off strong with some great art but fades off in the last 3 chapters. The art gradually goes downhill. It's not really bad art, it's just not up to the standard set by the earlier work by Mike Miller.The story is a bit ponderous & I imagine trying to read these in single format would've been a nightmare (I'm not just talking about all the release delays). However, the characters are well developed & as a Wheel of Time fan I was delighted to see the characters & different armies come to life. The double spread of Tar Valon is fantastic.The extra's are good although some of the comments Robert Jordan has to make to Chuck Dixon worry me for the rest of the Wheel of Time adaptations. Chuck wanted to have Aiel on horses. That's just wrong.Overall, what could've been a brilliant adaptation is just a solid one."
4,Mostly Great Art! Follows the story well.,I've been reading The Wheel of Time since 1995. It is my favorite fantasy series. This graphic novel brings the New Spring book to life! The art is great for the first half of the book or so. Later chapters it becomes less detailed. You can tell that the artist changed and there was a relative time difference between when the first portion and the second portion of the novel.It has been awhile since I read New Spring but this Graphic Novel follows the story very well and the dialogue is straight from the book. There was only one small part that I recalled from the full story that seemed left out but it did not detract from the product.If you are a Wheel of Time fan this is definitely worth owning!
4,The Further Chronicles of Conan,"All of the tales included in this book were great. But, if you've read other books by Jordan this is all but expected. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes fantasy novels. I would also recommend any of the other books written by the Master."
2,Different artist for the final editions,"I have been anxiously awaiting this compilation since Red Eagle started releasing these several years ago. Unfortunately, the artist(s) for the final 3 volumes is different than the one(s) who started it. Volumes 1 - 5 have phenomenal artwork and design/placement. The last 3 volumes look like they were inked with dry erase markers by a kindergarten kid with Parkinson's. I do not recommend this unless you don't care what the artwork looks like."
1,Can't see display,This case is not very handy and it is very difficult to see the display. I wish I did not buy it.
1,What protection?...Do not buy,"Bought these for my children ages 9 and 11. Guess who dropped the mp3 player...me. First time, it chipped the corner of the case and the mp3 player. The case popped right open as well. There is no protection what so ever, why ever bother. I should have just saved my money to buy a new mp3 player when something happens to it."
3,Warning: Picture looks better than real product,"Not sure how they got this picture from the product that was sent to me. The ""Chrome Mirrored Case"" was more brown in color than chrome but it does function very well. It does not reflect as it is advertised but it is clear and you can see through it to see the screen. You have to change the settings on your Sansa mp3 screen so that the backlight is brighter in order to see it. It is darker - a light see thru brown - than this picture. But because it does work very well, so I didn't send it back. It protects my Sansa and I prefer this hard case look over a leather cover. There are no color choices so I'm confused why mine is different from the picture. Perhaps the mirror chrome color has faded on the product I received."
1,Waste of money,"I have almost crashed my car numerous times trying to find the right angle to view the screen of my Sansa through this thing. Between the reflective screen and the numerous scratches (item is not at all scratch resistant), it is almost impossible to see in any type of sunlight in the car."
2,Really a reflect case,"It was my bad to buy this based on people reviews and now I regret for it.It was a stupid case I hardly saw the display but my damn face (lol)Anyway it's really true as the name said ""reflect case"""
2,Bland and unroasted,"At least to me they seem unroasted. They're very pale white - they almost look bleached. There's no salt added and they taste like, well, like almost nothing. I thought coming from a company called ""Spicy World"" that there would be some flavor!? I guess not. I'll go back go eating Planters. Until I use these up, I have mixed them at about 50/50 with my Planters Cashews."
1,Star Wars,"I have played most of the mmorpg's out there today, and I think by far this is the worst one yet. Unless you like the idea of spending hours killing alien insects and birds. You cannot even be a jedi right away, you have to unlock the force sensitive character slot which has been said will take up to a year for the casual player. The game is very buggy and there is nothing intuitive about the controls. You are only allowed one character per server, and the servers have a limited number of people allowed on at one time. So if you have a character you want to play on one server, and its full you won't be able to play him/her. The only good thing about this game is the skill system, other than that, i would rather not have wasted my money on it."
1,Took about 30 mins.,"For me to discover this game sucks. Blatant mockery of serious gamers around the world. Came here to see if the consensus was any better then my views, But it's obvious this game blows! Stay away and dont give these bastards anymore cash, like I'm sorry I did!"
2,Disapointed Star Wars fan...,"Was hoping for the best but ended up being very disapointed.Graphics are great but the game play suffers. Will give it another try in six months or so. Hopefully they will fix most of the bugs and maybe even expand it a bit.Back to ""Earth & Beyond"" for now."
1,Worst MMORPG Launch Title Ever.,"Pointless, monotonous and completely underdeveloped. This game might improve within 6-12 months, when the developers actually finish it. Makes me feel like I paid for a movie and was only allowed to watch the previews. Horribly boring combat system, broken quests, empty zones and an absolute pointless game."
3,For true fans only,"I bought this version of the game, and I am quite happy that I did. However, I also didn't mind spending a few extra bucks, and I like Star Wars. When I really look at what I got, it wasn't a whole lot to be honest.There is the actual game (which is great and I rated a 5... but that's for the regular version, not the collectors edition). Then, you get a silly little figurine, which resembles a 2 inch silver toy solder from space. Not very exciting. You can hardly tell what it is. The back of the manual has the signatures of the most important developers printed on (not my cup of tea, really, but if it gets you excited...). There are a few minor things, like a Star Wars pin I believe.The only thing that is any good here is the ""Art of Star Wars Galaxies"" book. This is pretty cool (and apparently can't be purchased elsewhere). But whether or not it is worth 30 bucks more than the regular version is up to you to decide..."
4,"Not what it should be, but still fun.","I will keep it succinct.The game is good, I have loads of fun, mostly because I love the Star Wars Universe.Does this game have what I feel it should have? No, there is plenty I would change. In fact, I feel that SoE is doing a poor job of maintaining the Star Wars Universe.Nevertheless, it still is fun.-End"
2,subscription service is like a russian bread line,The game is awesome not only does it comes with a requsite subscription service so you may have the privledge of paying up to 143 dollars a year in fees. But waiting to pay is harder than getting into a NYC hotspot. Given the ammount of time they pushed back the release date one should expect them to have maintained a proper backend infrastructure instead of trying to run the subscription service off an apple IIe in some guys basement.
4,while buggy still tons of fun,"i don't even get to play as often as i want to but i still love the game. i love the interaction with other players (this being my first PVP game). But being a devoted star wars fan I was a little skeptical when i heard form others its not true to star wars. While there are some odd things, I find it fascinating. A great mix of OT, PT and EU!!Yeah there are bugs but they get fixed pretty quickly. It would get 5 stars except for the loosing of my clothes form time to time. With the advent of Player Cities I am haivng even more fun, meeting new players and exploring new areas...I am going to be purchasing more memory due to lag-but its worth it.Just make sure you have the min requirements before starting."
3,It's pretty fun,"It took me awhile to purchase this game because of all the bad reviews that I read here on Amazon from other players. I thought I would go ahead and give it a try to see for myself. I am glad I did. The game is really fun. I am a big Star Wars fan. I think if I wasn't, the game wouldn't be as fun as it is.I have only been playing for about 2 weeks now. I have had a few problems with my pc locking up while playing in a highly populated city. That is the only problem I have encountered so far.The graphics are awesome and the players are very nice. So far I haven't run into any ""Drama"" unlike UO which is filled with ""Drama"".I think the monthly price is a bit high and hope they will consider dropping it a bit."
2,Wait 6 months.,"I beta tested this product through phases 3 & 4(final phase). While it was reasonably fun, and certainly has potential to be a great game, to be perfectly blunt they went live with it before it was ready. As it stands, Star Wars: Galaxies is extremely bug-ridden. Many MMORPGs are released as such, and it generally takes a good 6 months, if not longer, before the product reaches a reasonable semblance of stability.If you buy this game right now, then you're paying to beta test. Wait until a good 6 months have passed, and then you'll likely be treated to a fun and stable product."
3,"Great vision, horrible implementation, in-game service...","Star Wars Galaxies is a good game, gone bad. The feature set is great, with lots of playable professions, etc. There are are bugs however, throughout. Hard-core MMORPG fans (who read online forums for fun) will be mildly aggravated. However the casual player is likely to just quit playing. My advice: this game can be great fun... if you aren't into knowing about the bug du-jour I'd suggest waiting a few months."
4,"NDA is up, my opinion, as a beta player.","I've been in beta for a while now, and I can reliably say that I will play this game as soon as it goes live. That said, I think people need to have a realistic view of this game. I had such high hopes, and really an unrealistic picture in my mind of this game before I got into beta. When I did, I won't lie to you, it was a let down. Not because of the bugs, or anything the game does really. It's just not the game you think it is. That said, I still love it. It's not ready for retail, but my opinion means little at this point. I DO encourage you to play it though, and stick with it even with all the problems you're going to encounter. It's a great game, I'd just advise you to get rid of any ideas you have in your head of what it's going to be like."
1,You cant play this onlinegame,"This game is no longer able to play. It is a online game, and all the servers has been shut down. It was a great game. But they destroyed it. After the destruction, many subscribers left quit playing the game.On December 15, 2011 at 9:01 PM Pacific time, the servers of Star Wars Galaxies shut down, disconnecting those still playing and not allowing any entry back to the game."
2,SWG is a dead game,Sony's Star Wars Galaxies can not be played online anymore. Sony Lucasarts pulled the plug. It's replacement is Star Wars: The Old Republic.
2,NDA lifted - Some truth revealed by a BETA tester,"I have been Beta testing this game for quite some time now and I was honestly ready to buy it up until the last update patch. Do yourself a favor, do not buy this game for another 6 months or so. It is not finished, I repeat IT IS NOT FINISHED. There are a ton existing bugs and server problems that will make it unbearable to play for quite a while. They have made any type of advancement take weeks to accomplish so that you do not advance into the unfinished parts of the game. You are honestly paying for open Beta testing. This is the status quo for online games nowdays (minus anything from Blizzard). I had high hopes for this game and was looking forward to its release, but now I am being forced to look for something else to entertain me. Only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the graphics are extremely well done."
1,A SW Fan & Gamer,This game was great at one point but has been completely redone. It is more like EQ2 & World of Warcraft now. If you are looking for either of these games with a Star Wars feel this is it right now. If you have to get this game I would not get the collector's edition. Its not worth the extra money and all you get are some funky glasses you can wear ingame
1,Save your money,This game simply does not deliver. I've played from the start and the game is still not ready for retail release. The number of non-functional professions and bugs is simply mind numbing. This game more closely resembles Pokemon than Star Wars - everyone in the game has a pocket monster that they use to attack other players and creatures with.There is no content in this game. Most of the quests still do not work.Game mechanics are horrid. Do NOT waste your money on this junk. After you buy the box you still have to pay $15 / month for a game that doesn't work! Don't waste your money.
5,Awesome,"ok, now with the NDA lifted, i have got to say it, this game is awesome. I have been beta testing it for sometime now and I love it."
4,Don't let people who are afraid of change ruin this for you,"I have been playing for amost a year. I rode through the CU and at first I admit i was unhappy. Once i LEARNED the style of play needed for the CU over the old day I realize that the game was just as fun as before (if not better). When hunting in groups it is much easier to progress your character and make money. Before the CU i had to grind away for months to get where I am able to get in couple of weeks of play now. If you are just buying the game and have no clue of how it was and will be learning the new CU style from scratch you will love it. The graphics are cool, the universe is large and the missions are much deeper now then they were when i started. There are those who are not happy with the changes, but don't let that get in your way. Try it and enjoy (it's only $25 at the end of the day)"
1,I don't think so...,"Well for me Star Wars has always been one of the most pop candy of all sci-fi's so the game scares me that it will follow in that line, especialy now that they have taken out the dark jedi as being playable."
5,Buy this Game!,"I have been playing SWG as a Beta tester for a couple of months, and as of today, we are still under the NDA so I can't give out specifics. But the attention to detal in this game is amazing, the graphics and sound are supurb,and game play will appeal to both the casual and hardcore gammer. Its not a mind numbing grind game.If you like Star Wars and online RPG's, This will be worth your money."
2,Someone give me a lightsaber to slay the makers of SWG,Dear god in Heaven this game is trash but it is still in away funif you are an avid starwars fan like my self this game is awsome to bad it costs 20 friggin bucks a month it cost to much that even a true fan is given considerable pain and there are no space craft space and the jedi are weaklings tou want a starwars game try dark forces or JK2 or Kinghts of the old republic
2,"Seriously Flawed, Glib, Boring, Shallow","Most of this book seems to focus on the ""adult"" video industry, with a hefty portion of wife swapping thrown in. The former is pretty much a LA industry, and the latter is more of a realm for perverted hobbyists than part of the Las Vegas sex business. The book cruises along for quite a while before getting to the meat and potatoes of prostitution and ""gentlemen's clubs"" in Vegas. Those parts of the book at least have some interest, but the author wastes too much paper, ink and readers' time on the personal history of each and every stripper, hooker, and wannabe that he interviews. It seems that there is much to be written about the BUSINESS of sex in Vegas, and even more about how that business is carried out, and by whom. Sadly, this is not the book for that."
2,Not exactly a totally accurate book,"As one who has owned both an Extoic Dancer Web site and a Las Vegas Escort Web site, I have met known and photgraphed dancers and escorts going back to 1997 anf quiter frankly a lot of information is just not right. While those he interviewed those things might be true, but in general they seem out od whack with the many ladies I have known. This is true particularly for the escorts, as anyone with any brains can see that escorts don't start out at $500 for an hour. Don't waste money on this book, is mostly a lot of hype and while you might find it entertaining, there is just too much that is flat out wrong. There are better books I am sure if you want to get the lowdown on the adult industry in Vegas."
1,What a dissapointing book,"I have never posted a review before, but felt the need to do so after reading half of this utterly useless book. I am a voracious reader who loves stories about Las vegas, but this book is not worth your time. I feel like a sucker for buying it and hope that I can save someone else from wasting their money."
5,Couldn't put it down,"The first chapter, in which Sheehan describes his visit to the ""Oscars of Porn"" is the one that stood out for me. He plays the role of ""Everyman"" as he becomes our peephole into a world we've all been curious about but have never seen. His humor is infectious - I kept laughing out loud as I read about the people who call porn their career. Some of it is so outrageous - you just have to laugh.Everything in this book is just fascinating - I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it - though given the cover - maybe read it in the privacy of your own home.Excellent!"
2,much better books out there...,"I bought this book because amazon keep pushing it to me based on the other books I have bought. Of all the books I have bought on the sex industry, this has been the worst. It gives no new information. It dosn't ""uncover"" anything. Anyone who hasn't been living in a cave for the past 50 years already knows everything in this book. Yes, there are strip clubs and escorts and swingers in las vegas. Las vegas has a lot of sex going on. ""what happens here, stays here."" Don't buy this book unless you really don't know what a strip club is, or what swingers do with each other. Save your money."
4,"Entertaining primer, but may be too basic for more 'experienced' readers","Jack Sheehan is allegedly a happily married man and long-time resident of Las Vegas. With Skin City, he has written an expose of poorly kept secrets sprinkled with travel tips and pricing guides. Though some of the material (descriptions of certain strip clubs, legalized brothels, etc.) is specific to Vegas, other subjects such as pornography are not. Sheehan uses interviews with prostitutes, gigolos, strippers, and porn stars to bring the reader into the world of the sex industry. He also uses some first person accounts: in a particularly ""ewwwww""-inspiring section he describes his teenage encounter with a prostitute. (Too much information, Jack!)Skin City is an easy read. Although those in the know will likely learn nothing new here, the average Joe (or perhaps I should say Jane since all my guy friends seemed to know everything in this book already) will be entertained."
2,Wrist band is not good,"The watch itself is very small. I like mid size Timex, but this is smaller then usual. The wrist band is plain piece of rubber band and feels and looks subpar.Decided to return without use."
1,Don't waste your money,"An excellent film, but a horrible DVD.A wonderful movie is ruined by the pathetic quality of this disc. This is the absolute worst transfer to DVD I have ever seen. It looks as if it was taken from an incredibly well worn VHS copy."
1,Really poor transfer to DVD,"If the very poor quality of the transfer of this film to DVD is any indication of what to expect from Alpha Video Distributors, I will not knowingly buy another Alpha Video product. As for the movie itself, it's pretty good, aside from taking some minor liberties with the historical record. Inadvertently it's also quite revealing in regard to what American cultural attitudes were like in the era when this picture was made (1940). This is a movie that could not be produced in today's atmosphere of political correctness, and numerous scenes are likely to raise eyebrows among present-day audiences."
5,Interesting vintage social studies book,"Pictoral cover, b/w photographs and illustrations, 63 pgs; Tells history of Pakistan, Mahatma Gandhi, immigration of people to U.S., famous Indians, Pakistanees who live in America and contribute to sciences, entertainment, and other areas. 63 pages plus capsule of author. This book is part of The IN AMERICA Series, evidently designed for childre"
5,more hunger for God,"This is a great book that is a collection of his best devotional articles. Unlike other message with 'comfort', his sharing is full of 'power'. You are challenged/ commanded to choose the way to be a good disciple. If you are hunger for God, read it, and you will be even more hunger for God."
4,Makeba magnificant,"This combined CD of Miriam Makeba's first and second LPs has the wonder of forward thinking and backward bliss. Hardly sold at time, the first LP, ""Miriam Makeba"" was a part of the US folk eagerness to hear new sounds. Like Harry Belefonte before her, there was a market for pleasant new rhythms and exotic but true belief.It helped that Miriam sounded like Joan Baez with an accent.In one of the most eyebrow raising great Pop moments, Miriam had a Top 12 hit with, ""Pata Pata"", a So. African child sing/song. Ya had ta be there!The rest of the CD is for collectors and Paul Simon's payoff."
2,Try to see things my way.,"This CD features mostly bad cover versions of Beatles' songs. Samm Bennett and Chunk do a good version of ""Dear Prudence"", and Les Miserables Brass Band turn in a decent version of ""Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"", but everything else is pretty bad. Here is the complete track listing:1. ""Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"" by Les Miserables Brass Band2. ""Come Together"" by Defunkt3. ""I wanna Hold Your Hand"" by Alex Chilton4. ""Why Don't We Do It in the Road"" by Lydia Lunch5. ""Day in the Life"" by Eugene Chadbourne6. ""Dear Prudence"" by Samm Bennett and Chunk7. ""We Can Work It Out"" by King Missile8. ""Taxman"" by Fred Lonberg-Holm9. ""Blue Jay Way"" by Buddha Pest10. ""Don't Let Me Down"" by Arto Lindsay, Mark Ribot, Syd Straw, Joey Baron & Greg Cohn11. ""Revolution #9"" by Kurt Hoffman's Band of Weeds12. ""Eleanor Rigby"" by Les Miserables Brass Band"
2,the magnification was different,"In the picture, it showed the different magnification as 5x, 10x, etc. but when it came in, it was listed as 1x, 2x, 3x. I called the company and they said the smaller the number the bigger the magnification. I told them to change the picture to reflect the true eye loupes. Its not a bad product just should be depicted in the picture so that you're not left wondering what you had ordered."
5,Set of 5 Watchmakers Eye Loupes,The range of eye loupes were very attractive to me as I evaluate a wide range of products in the antique industry. All of them are well constructed and do exactly what I need them to do.
2,Plastic,"The product title says, ""Watchmakers Set of 5 Eye Loupe."" On the box it says, ""Eye Glass Plastic Set Of Five."" The product title is very misleading. This set is made of plastic from India. These are definitely not watchmaker's tools."
5,It's what I need,"I was searching a long time for a product like this, it's very useful to me, really wonderful to know about it, thanks a lot"
3,Didnt work,"However the company I purchased it from was great about it. They didnt have another in stock to replace it, so they refunded my money promptly."
2,Don't bother,"I am a pretty big Doors fan and this CD stunk. I was expecting something on the lines of those London Symphony Orchestra Cd's, but it was nowhere close. I don't think Jim would be happy w/ it either."
4,Great for Apartments,These wall stickers are removable leaving no residue on the wall. Great for Apartment living where painting is not allowed. Easy to put up and adjust - my husband and I had a blast decorating the baby's room.
2,Don't waste your time,"My husband & I wanted to run the IL. river from Grafton to Liverpool in our boat. So we bought this book. Before we received it, we put our boat in at Liverpool, mile 128 & went down to mile 97.5 Brownsville. The book doesn't mention anything about the Marina in Havana where you can get gas & eat. It doesn't mention Bath at all where they have a bar on the river & you can get food & drinks. It says you can get gas in Brownsville, but you can't! They have food & thats it! Those are enough mistakes for us to decide to send the book back. It cannot be reliable. Unless you want to get stuck out on the river without gas, I would not buy this book!"
5,Very underrated gem here!!,"To The Max never received the acclaim it deserved. This album returns The Mentors back to their rocking, creative days of ""You Axed For It"" and ""Up The Dose"". No doubt this release is side by side with those releases as being effin awesome!! Their prior release ""Rock Bible"" really suffered by their songwriting and it seemed they were all lazy. I think they may have lost steam with their fans on that one. But they returned with this juggernaut release To The Max. Songs like ""Menage Aw Twa"" ""When You're Horny, You're Horny"" ""Sex Slave"" and the rockin ""Mother/Daughter Team"", they showed that musically and lyrically they got their ""Mojo"" back and made some of their most catchiest, sleazy, rockin songs in a long time. When I first heard when I bought it on its release date all I could think was WELCOME BACK MENTORS!!! This won't disappoint anyone!"
5,"Not Just ""Dinner Music""","Flawlessly executed renditions of well known standards. Here, as elsewhere, BA sports Oscar Peterson-like technique and sensibilities sans the 128th-note riffs. While hard-core jazz enthusiasts may find her work a bit ""straight"" or predictable, BA is clearly a first-rate pianist."
2,Looked like a great idea,"I was excited to get this for Christmas, but the mixer on the bottom doesn't spin unless the mug is placed at a specific point in the base. Then something goes wrong where all of the cocoa power collects and burns at the bottom of the inside of the mug and it shoots hot milk out through the top- even with everything sealed and shut in the lid. I had to reach through an eruption of extremely hot chocolate to pull the mug off of the base. And, the stainless steel on the inside of the mug doesn't clean well. I had to utilize an old toothbrush initially to scrub the inside clean- now I won't use it, guess I have to contact the company 8("
1,Worthless,"This product is worthless and the company that makes it is worthless. It only gets a one because there are no negative numbers. I bought this product at Kmart used it once and the second time it didn't spin and burnt. The entire cup was black. I contacted the company they offered to replace it only if I shipped it to them at my cost. I ended up taking it back to the store. I thought maybe I had gotten a defective one, but the replacement did the exact same thing. I took it back and got my money back. I wouldn't waste my money on this product or any product for that matter made by Back to Basic."
2,Quality is disappointing,"I bought this from a local Target store for making hot coco in my office. It started out well enough, I just had to make sure I don't over-fill the cup with water and a cup of hot chocoalate was ready in minutes, although it was not the easiest task in the world to clean the thing afterwards.After a few month, however, the little spinner at the bottom of the cup quit working and now it obviously does not mix and is a mere water heater.For the price, this is a very useful small appliance, but unfortunately, the quality leaves much to be desired."
3,good product,"I bought one of these at a thrift store and it worked when I first got it. I used it a couple times this year, and started to notice that the mixer at the bottom stopped working. It still heats water though you do have to wait a couple minutes to drink it, it is a bit hotter then perfect drinkable temperature. Other than that it works fine except that some of the rubber thing in the lid has come out. Other wise a good product though. UPDATE: I found a solution to the spinner problem, I just put it through a cycle with only water in it, then made hot chocolate after that and it's spinning now. A cause of the spinner to stop spinning is chocolate built up in the bottom. I had that happen too. I justpoured the chocolate into a mug, rinsed out the chocolate, put the hot chocolate back in and heated it up and it worked."
4,Long Live Dicatorism,"This Dictator release represented a last gasp for commercial viability. Of course, that was never going to happen nor should it have happened. Not quite as vital or as naive as their previous releases, Bloodbrothers still contains enough of what made the Dictators unique. The cover of Slow Death is simply awesome!"
5,Seven stars for the Dictators!,"Man, oh man! This is the stuff baby. The mighty Dictators worship cars, girls and more girls! The Dictators have been an influence on bands like The Devil Dogs and The Humpers who, during the weak grunge and ""pop punk"" 90's, tried to get folks listening to real rock'n'roll again. That alone is reason to worship the Dictators.People, all I can only say is that The Dictators rule baby! This is what punk should have been. Unfortunately, the super lame ""hardcore"" movement pretty much drained punk of all of it's rock'n'roll spirit in the 80's. The whole ""punk"" world would suck a lot less today if people had listened to this stuff instead of metal heads like Sick Of It All and Agnostic Front or those morons The Exploited. Like, how lame are the Exploited anyway? Yikes!This record is rockin', honest and full of the spirit of honest-to-god, red-blooded American rock'n'roll! Long live The Dictators."
4,"Now, as before","When I hear the Dictators today, they sound as good as...no, BETTER than....they did, in 1977. I saw them open for KISS in 1977, in Iowa (yes, Iowa). Most in the crowd didn't have a clue as to what to make of this band. For me, they made me want to go home 10 minutes into KISS' set. They were THAT good! They rattled the rafters, and the feature band was ill prepared to follow up. KISS fumbled through their songs, like they'd never played them before. Many in the crowd began to chant ""We want the Dictators"", as they started to see how good the Dictators really were. I can't help but feel deja vu here. The Dictators are still trying to get the respect NOW...that they deserved THEN. Long live Punk."
4,Poetry with Heart,"Waide Riddle's book, ""All American Texan"", is an enlightening first work by this up and coming author. It is unusual that this first work is a book of poetry. Waide's poems are heartfelt and endearing in some passages, dark and gripping in others. Reading these poems truly gives you a sense of who the author really is and what it was like to grow up as he did. You will find things in these poems that you will identify with and that will spark memories of your own life. I find myself reading and re-reading this book, discovering new things in it each time. I highly recommend this book for anyone that enjoys poetry."
4,favorite poet,This poet knows about the things he writes so intimately that asyou read you can feel the passion coming through almost as atangable thing. All his work has a very personal touch to it.The words flow so well they pull you into the story and don't let you go until the very end. I think his work is very refeshing.
5,great book,resembles the titanic a lot this is a wonderful addition to any library .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .
5,A true light,"This book is amazing . It is one of the only book that has practicals advices on how to become holy through overcoming sexual temptations. It is a must for every Yeshivah(talmudic) student, who need to learn how to deal with their desires in a world where everything pushes you to become adicted to pleasures."
5,Hypnotic,"This is a great CD for almost everything! I listen to relax, I listen to energize, I listen while driving, while at work, or I use it to practice my bellydance moves. I can also put it on in the background almost anytime and I love it all the way through. I also recommend the Sabla Tolo CD by H.Ramzy if you want something faster, more upbeat & purely percussional. These 2 CD's are a great balance & truly complement one another."
3,Mixed reviews for this book...,"This is my first Godwin and I don't know if I'd do another. An interesting story- I began to relate to it immediately. A young woman, married to a man she couldn't wait to marry- wondering where the pizazz went after 6 years. Okay- I'll bite. But then the story got too wordy. Lots of great characters. Adrian. Tony. Chase. But an awful lot of Episopal doctrine interwoven with an active story and a lot of characters. Godwin's message got lost in all of the competing actions and story lines and philosophy. The end was just plain sad. There were parts that were great. Other parts, I wished I had had something else to read. Took me a while to get through this book. No easy read here."
2,"Great language, but not appropriate for the characters","I kept plodding away at this book, but for some reason the book did not ring true for me. Finally I figured it out! There is a lot of dialog in this book. The characters throughout all spoke with such eloquence and grace, something that they all should not have considering their ages and backgrounds. This really bothered me, even Chase said things that were not appropriate for a 17 year old boy living in the mountains. Godwin did use some nice imagery, however, and I found myself reading to find this type of language, not to get into the story and plot which was rather flat, in my opinion."
4,"Good, but does not live up to Father Melancholy","I couldn't wait to read this one to find out what had happened to the characters from Father Melancholy. Be sure to read Father Melancholy's Daughter first if at all possible. Gail Godwin is brilliant. There is amazing complexity in the relationships among these characters. However I thought Grace was really annoying and somewhat stereotyped. Also the milleniuum theme seemed to be more of a playing up to the current madness than actually essential to the story. Overall the book was worth reading. If you like Gail Godwin, don't miss The Good Husband. It is still my favorite of her works."
4,Who wouldn't want Margaret for their pastor?,"This is my first Gail Godwin novel--I will certainly turn to the others. The narrator, Pastor Margaret, is a fully realized character: engaging, brilliant, passionate, flawed, self-aware and insightful. Who wouldn't want her for their pastor? The plot is a trifle contrived, but in the end it moved me. I will turn to Father Meloncholy's Daughter next for more of this terrific writer and her characters."
2,Like watching grass grow,"I've read most of Godwin's books and enjoyed them, but Evensong is the exception. The pace is very slow, the flashbacks can make it difficult to follow, and the characters are never developed enough to make them interesting. Not one I would recommend as one of her best."
4,It Can't Be True!,"I couldn't believe it when I saw this book I needed for a book group at the price of 1 cent! At first, I thought it may be an error. I decided to take a chance on it and was pleased the book arrived promptly and in very good condition! Now I just need to find the time to read it!"
4,Evenly paced,"Evensong is a very quiet, almost passive book with a strong dose of dignity thrown in. The story revolves around a married Episcopalian clergy couple and the inner workings of their Parish and by extension their New England town. The pace is very slow and it's tone steady and sure and the book definitely knows where it is going so even when you begin to get sort of bored, stick it out. The major themes are: religion, love, family and friendship and it is a well rounded book. My only quip against this book is that as with any non-Catholic Christian novel, there is the customary jibe at Catholicism. I still recommend it."
3,"Great subject, shallow treatment!","The trials of a woman in the Episcopalian priesthood should provide material for a great narrative! How one longs for a Bernanos, a Mauriac, or a Graham Greene to tackle this subject. Give Godwin credit for her efforts and the attention she is finally prepared to give to the working problems of a professional woman. The reader cares enough about this heroine to wish her well as she ministers in a difficult enough setting and wonders why she has chosen her dull, self-pitying husband above the activist poet who loves her through the years. That one really does sound interesting. Beyond the offensive stereotype characters - why must Southern fundamentalists always be depicted as potentially violent fanatics? - the chief problem with this book is that it lacks the essential resonance and dimension to do justice to its themes and subject."
2,"""Evensong"" is no ""Father Melancholy's Daughter""","I've read all of Gail Godwin's books, and own most of them, and I am disappointed to say that this one just didn't do a thing for me. If you haven't read ""Father Melancholy's Daughter,"" which I thoroughly enjoyed, you probably won't even grasp fully the subtleties and undercurrents in the relationship between the Reverends Bonner in ""Evensong."" And even if you have read the former book, ""Evensong"" never really rings true. The author keeps referring to the next millenium in a foreboding tone, but at the end, in regard to that particular story line, I was left with a feeling of ""so what?"" Too many unlikely happenings, too many deep dark secrets that are really neither, too many unbelievable characters: simply, too much of too much. I'll read her next book because I usually enjoy Godwin, but this one gets a ""better luck next time."""
2,Where's the story?,"This is my first Godwin book; I did not read ""Father Melancholy."" This book rambles shamelessly. Margaret has the ""voice"" of a sixty year old, not a contemporary 33-year-old, despite her vocation. There is no thread of story, only a series of seemingly disconnected events beneath the umbrella of the approaching millenium. The prose is often awkward and stilted. Margaret is a stuffy character, to boot. A disappointment."
1,"Jan Karon, not Gail Godwin, fans will like this one!","As a fan of Gail Godwin, I couldn't wait to delve once again into the world of human relationships, spirituality, and the complexities that develop between the two. I was so very disappointed. I made myself read it, hoping upon hope that the ""real"" Gail Godwin would come through. It did not happen; I gave up before the end. There is simply no depth there. The characters are very thin. You begin to dislike Margaret, because she can love someone so unappealing in personality as Adrian. No child as disturbed as Chase can suddenly become so engaging. The plot twists are too easy to foretell. If you are a Jan Karon fan, you won't be disappointed--romance, church happenings, orphans, and the expected return of a long lost parent in a small North Carolina mountain town. Sound too familiar? This one will not give you much for thought."
4,like the attitude,"I love the way she can talk her way into and out of things(but not always does it work!). Her attitude is somewhat like mine, but WORSE! great book, just don't like the way each book doesn't REALLY continue the next(at least not till now, besides when every character from every book meet) anyway, great book."
4,All together,"I loved having finally all the kids together, i never got to read alien blood as i cant find it anywhere but by the end of the first 6 books i feel i know her as well as the others. Any way this book is great as you now feel as if the kids are a real team and could do a lot together and have a chance against the omegas(read #7) Toni is a great character and i think has the best powerse, shes not my faveourite though, thats Jack and Elena, they are both soooo cool. Toni's abillity to control electricity really helps all the kids in loads of situations throughout the books. This book is the book where something big finally happens to the group and they are really put to the test.A great book and real ""on the edge of your seater"""
5,No Swimming on Sunday,"For people who want to reminisce about the days when church was quite a bit different than today, this book will be a ""memory awaker."" It helps you travel happily through those days when there was a bit more legalism than today, yet we didn't realize it as being bad. It was just there. So we made the best of it, sometimes attempting to stretch the limits and enjoy our Christian faith anyway!Having grown up in the same family as the author, and having devoted my entire life to ministry in the same denomination, I have found the evolution of the church to be refreshing, productive, joyous, and sometimes frightening. But I don't think that God is wringing His hands wondering what is going on! Some excesses, and some carelessness will always be in existence whenever humans try to run things.This author traversed the extremes in a healthy manner and has concluded that to be a Christian is still in vogue and living for Jesus can still be fun!"
5,Well Worth the Money!,"I almost got scared off by the reviews that said there were little or no instructions included. Glad I went ahead and got it! Not only are the materials a high grade (Yes, it is the same kit that Invicta sells on ShopNBC for $49.95), but a strip of paper came in the kit with a web site link for detailed instructions on how to use all the tools. I changed my first watch band and sized a few watch bracelets tonight and it was very simple. Saved at least $8 per watch, so the kit has already paid for itself and I have more watches on the way that will need adjustments.Do NOT be scared off! The seller (watch material)includes the directions and the kit arrived in only 2 days!"
1,Quality is horrible,"I received this product today, and immediately packed it back up for return. The box itself is a joke, and looks like it's been put together by a 3 year old. The tools inside look like something you'd get at the dollar store. I'm not sure how much this watch repair stuff is supposed to cost, but anything more than $10.00 for this kit is a rip off."
2,Cheaply Made,This works okay but is very cheaply made. I would find a better quality one because this one looks and feels like a cheap toy.
4,Watch Repair Kit,This was an easy to use kit and it provided me with exactly what I needed to remove some links from my watch and also to remove the back cover and replace my battery.
1,Piece of Garbage!,"This thing is an absolute piece of S@#$ The cardboard case was falling apart upon receipt, and the cheap Chinese tools will break just looking at them, and looking is all you will do since it comes with no instructions or web address. Do not buy this garbage!"
3,"""functional"", but poor quality","All the basic watch ""tune-up"" tools are here in one place and will probably work for their intended purpose. However, as some other reviewers have noted, the overall quality of the tools is poor, so some of them may only work a few times! I am particularly annoyed with the screwdrivers, whose tips break too easily. That being said, watch tools seem to come at only 2 price points: quite cheap (like this set) and quite expensive (for example, Amazon sells a 9-piece Bergeon screwdriver set for about $140!). So if you will only seldom use the tools, it might be ok to settle for this set; it will be cheaper than having a watch shop change your batteries or bracelets a few times. But be aware that there are no instructions on how to use the tools so you will need to go to Youtube for that info. If you do not want to do that, skip this item and see your jeweler. If you are a more serious hobbyist or collector, I'd piece together better quality tools."
5,Watch Link Tool Kit,"Item was purchased as a gift for a male who loves watches! Item has only been used once thus far; therefore, only specific tools were used and those seemed to do their job to the tee."
4,Great addition to any watch owners.,I started getting into watch collecting and didn't want to keep having to bring them in for adjustments and battery replacements.This kit includes all the things I needed however I knocked off a star for the flimsy case it comes in and also for not including instructions. Thankfully YouTube and common sense took care of the rest but still it would have been a nice to have.
2,"Poor Quality, not durable, don't waste money",Poor quality. One of the screw driver is already broken by using 2 times.
3,Blue tool useless!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have tried many times to use the blue tool without success! However, the rest of the product is useable, if you don't mind a mini-hammer. I did read the other reviews on this and other like items and this review just agrees with the existing reviews.I still would buy it for the other items which I have successfully used to size my own watches; saving me more then the cost of the toolkit in jeweler fees."
5,money saver,"If you like to save money on simple watch adjustments, this is the kit for you. Adjust bands and replace batteries like it is done at watch repair and jewelry stores. This kit will pay for itself in short time, depending on how many watches you own. A real time and money saver."
5,all the necessary tools for adjusting watch bands,The tools in this kit where perfect for adjusting the watch bands that I had. It lived up to the description.
4,"Does the job, plus some","This is not the first tool I'ld add to my work bench, but it has some pieces I'm glad to have. I re-sized my watch band in just a few minutes and only had one little incident with doing something the wrong way. Did I mention that the instructions are somewhat lacking? In hind-sight I should have figured it out before I made the mistake, but that's hind-sight for you. If your good with working with tools, and you have a need to adjust a watchband at least every Christmas, then this is a good deal."
1,James,"I bought this item to remove some links from a Tag Heurer watch. While it did work, it did not work well. The pin removers are cast and one broke on the second link i took out. While I was able to resize the watch for me, I doubt I will be able to size another watch without breaking the already bent pin remover. I would not buy this product again. I will be looking for a better quality resizing kit."
3,Description misleading,I read the ad over and over but not being familiar with watch tools I was misled. This tool kit is for watch band adjustment. It has a tool for removing snap on case backs but nothing for screw on case backs. All I really needed was to remove a screw on case back. If you need to open a screw on case back to replace a battery etc DO NOT get this tool kit!! It may do many things but not that.
4,Great Product and Fast shipping,"This product was exactly as described and arrived on time, would do business with again!"
3,Watch Band Adjusting Link Removing Tool,"Product seems to be sturdy, although I actually haven't use it. It came with a nice box that keeps the little tools in one place. Being a novice, I don't know where to use the square hard black plastic that came with it. I did not find any instruction of its usage."
2,Cheaper Is Not Better,The link remover is too flimsy to work. I can't even say it works poorly. One of the two tweezers is missing. The case is nice.
1,Be carefull,"Some of the reveiews you read here are writen by business owners that sell boily generators. of course they say its a great/5 star rating. I bought 1 of these generators and it was not good by any means,nor was the business in Wisconsin that sold it to me."
5,New improved model (2008 blue & black ) Pro 3600SI competes head to head with new inverter models!,"The newest generation of Boliy units, the (blue& black 2008), boliy Pro 3600Si, has had modifications made from the original red boliy units. Great quiet unit. Full two year warranty. This Boliy unit compete head to head with Honda, Kipor, Onan, .... This unit only weighs 68 lbs. More power, less weight & money!!"
5,Small priced stocks can provide a fantastic return.,"Mr. Bowser has provided the public with a tremendous set of strategies to incorporate into our own investing approaches. He has done so by staying away from a lot of the ""Wall Street Jargon"" which can intimidate many of us who are still learning. He provides information which is below the radar screen for most of the larger brokerage houses. If you are interested in pursuing investing on a do-it-yourself basis, his book will provide you with a solid basis from which to start your search for appropriate stocks. Most of us can afford to buy some shares at less than $3.00/share. Mr. Bowser provides the education necessary to select those stocks. He has done a very good service for the ""little guy"" in the investing field."
3,no that bad as it would be,"In a first sight, it's like a sales letter, trying to push you to buy Bowsers newsletter. But after all, the Bowsers rating system based on FA is revealed and it's not so bad. So, in this case you need decide - will you pay for several pages ""meat"". If yes, OK.But all other book of course is impolite sales letter"
1,A book to sell a newsletter,"I was very dissapointed in this book. Although iot does give some information relevant to the title, it continually promotes the purchased of the Bowser newsletter.I did not want to pay good money for an advertisment. There are better books out there that really address the subject matter."
2,Pushes the newsletter too much,"I gave up trying to read this book after coming across too many attempts within it to sell the author's newsletter. Other than that, I just didn't see anything noteworthy."
2,Not what I thought it was...,"This video ended up being all about training horses, with a documentary (complete with subtitles) about the trainer. I bought it for my daughter thinking it was about different horse breeds."
2,Not What I Was Looking For...,"In my opinion, this DVD was not marketed properly. I expected more from this DVD based on the title and description. Instead of being about horses of the WORLD, the DVD focused on horses in a particular Riding School and a particular Circus. In my opinion, a lot is missing if this was truly intended to be about Horses of the World."
1,not impressed,there should have been more info online re this dvd - as what we got was not what we expected
5,My dog loves it!,My senior Australian Shepherd loves the food and he has been doing very well since I started feeding it to him. He seems more energetic and doesn't have his usual summer skin allergies this summer.
5,Best Dog Food on the Market!,"Since we changed to Blue Buffalo for our dog's food, all four of our rescues have more energy, a shinier coat, and the one with terrible skin allergies doesn't chew as much. Blue leaves out all of the unnecessary fillers and only includes healthy ingredients. Plus, our dogs LOVE the flavor! I have found that having it shipped (free!) through Amazon.com is cheaper than driving the 30 minutes to PetSmart myself."
1,Do NOT Buy!!!,"Long story short, this food made my dog very sick. His stomach became very upset and bloody. Our vet said he has seen it happen many times and it is terrible food. My dog had to get fluids and be on antibiotics. Not fun at all!!!"
1,Blue Buffalo dog food,"Bought a bag, but after 5 days my older dog (13)was sicker than a dog.Gave the rest away to the SPCA and bought Newman's Own dog food.Now I have one happy, waggy dog again."
5,My picky eater loves this,"It has been a challenge to find a healthy dry food that my dog enjoys eating. (He prefers the cheap stuff with fillers, basically junk food). Not only does he like this stuff, this kibble has a bonus of being very thin and small, a plus for senior dogs with missing or sensitive teeth. It also helps with digestion. He has a sensitive stomach and so far has had no problems with bloating or gas.This stuff is expensive, but it isn't a scam. You honestly are getting a high quality food here."
4,Improvement,"I switched from a leading dog food that you can get in the grocery store. My dog is 10 years old and have some gas problems. The Blue Buffalo food did not completly resolve the gas issue, but it is better. His coat has improved greatly and his energy level also seems to be much better. I will continue using the Blue Buffalo Senior food."
2,Who said that the power was back?Because it sure is heck isnt.,"What the heck are the WWE talking about stating that the power is back.The power is lost and doesnt look like its coming back.Besides the WWE has been putting out dumb @ss p.p.v's for the last couple of years now maybe with the exception of Wrestlemania,and SummerSlam which are the biggest p.p.v's of the year besides Survivor Series.Vince next time please come out with an better moniker or campaign because the power is sure as hell not back 4 real!"

My favorite of this DVD was the 2 Smackdown vs. RAW matchups.Rey Mesterio & Matt Hardy vs. Gene Snitsky(Edge's replacement) & Chris Masters.A awesome matchup, there were high flying, extreme, and outrageous moves in the matchup.Batista(Stone Cold's replacement) vs. The Coach w/Goldust & Vader in a streetfight.A outrageous that The Coach, Goldust, & Vader got their asses whipped."

5,WWE,"Man i wish that RAW and SmackDown! can join together like years ago when there was no limit between the RAW and SmackDown! roster, every guy one RAW can come to SmackDown! can any guy on SmackDown! can come to RAW.I dont know why WWE can't make that. It'll be perfect if Batista or John Cena can face HHH. In almost 5 years that the Undertaker had never faced the Undertaker and those confrontations that we wish to see.I'm just done watching WWE RAW Homecoming and it was perfect, you see how a show would be if RAW and SmackDown! join togertherOne more thing, when is the championship reign of John Cena going to end??? i seriously cant wait"

1,Fun for approximately zero seconds,"We have one of these in our office. The up and down movements never worked. The missiles shoot three feet at best. If you are in an office prepare to shoot only the person sitting in the cube next to you. It does have a laser, which is always neat, but this thing is a piece of crap."
2,Thin!,"I guess I'm the only one displeased with these. I was expecting a thicker, card-stock or thin cardboard cover (like the old ones!), but instead the black covers are more like a slightly thicker paper cover (think cardstock paper, except even more flimsy). They do not stand on their own and look really cheap. Because I was expecting the old fashioned thicker covers, it seemed that 15 for 25 was a good deal, but after seeing these in person I wouldn't have paid more than .25 cents apiece for these, so they were a bad deal. Not sure if I'm going to go through the hassle and cost of returning them, but since I use them for high billing for my business and they look so shoddy, I'm not sure I'll find a use for them. Disappointed."
3,A good try,"I've never heard of the guy [John Hammond] before this CD came out. I'm a Waits fan...a big one. I'm delighted for any exposure his music gets to new crowds. Having said that, I must say I'm not overly impressed. Hammond takes a lot of liberty with the melodies. This isn't, in and of itself, a bad thing, and when it works, as on ""Clap Hands"" and ""Murder in the Red Barn,"" it sounds great. The problem, though, is that Hammond misses more often than he hits. ""Heartattack and Vine,"" for instance, is supposed to be a real fire-in-the-belly kind of song. Perhaps Hammond's rendition is fiery...for him. Tom's broken vocals make this song roar, though, and Hammond just doesn't (or can't) do it. There are a lot of good tracks on this album, but the overall feeling I was left with was very hit-or-miss. I like Tom, and I like the blues, but I think this could have been done better."
2,"Great musicians, great songs, lousy CD","After 39 reviews, I have some doubts about any beneficial effects the 40th may have, but I feel so strongly about this disc that I decided to weigh in anyway.Pretty straightforward, really: Tom Waits is a musical genius. John Hammond is a great blues guitarist, and a very good singer.Didn't they listen to this CD before they released it?Except for the passing novelty of hearing some of Tom's (deliberately) incomprehensible growling translated into english, this disc has very little to offer.You know that sensation you get when you hear a really great song performed as elevator music?Bingo."
2,Save your cash and buy the originals,I bought this CD fully expecting to really enjoy this since I love Tom Waits's music and I enjoy John Hammond's guitar playing. However after numerous plays I have since grown tired of this CD and I have sold it. After a while all of the songs seemed to sound the same and they don't hold a candle to the Tom Waits originals. So save your cash and buy the Tom Waits originals.
2,Inexplicable,"Who's idea was this anyway? Dull, affected vocalizing on top of some of the most overwrought musical cliches heard this year. Softening the songs doesn't do anything for them. The real thing is so much stronger than this tepid offering."
5,I Can't Say Enough About How Good This Album Is,"Some Tom Waits fans have panned it because John Hammond isn't Tom Waits. Were they surprised when they realized this? John Hammond is a master bluesman who has interpreted the music of others for decades. This time he takes on the song book of Tom Waits. And with some amazing results. Blues of all sorts on this album. Full band, solo acoustic guitar backing voice. Gospel, folk, swamp. Many musicians discuss not only the playing of the notes but the silence and the space between the notes. I love the ""space"" on this album. What a great album. Buy it today and pray for another to be released tomorrow. Thanks John. Thanks Tom."
4,Solid watch,"Nice look, very comfortable band... Battery went out after six months... Other than that good buy.... Blah blah blah blah......"
4,"why yes, I am addicted to caffeine.","this is definitely not your tiny nibble just a little caffeine mint. these things are a full-sized chocolate chew. very strong chocolate flavor with a lot of bitter along with the sweet. I found the aftertaste fairly unpleasant and hard to cleanse (all I had on hand was water.) There's only 6 of them in a tin, but as each one is a whole cup of coffee's worth of caffeine, you probably wont need more than one tin in your pack. And, yes, there really is a whole cup of coffee in one of them and it does hit you pretty quick.I still love these things! I buy them in the big box direct from the company! If you really like them, you can keep a couple of empty tins and used the boxed ones to fill the tins for carrying. I think the flavor is a nice balance. One caveat - they get really sticky when kept in conditions above 70 degrees or so, so I'd keep them refrigerated in summer unless you've got good AC."
3,daves not here man,"They taste pretty damn awesome, just don't eat them all at once like someone did...oh. and when you're done you can put your weed in it."
5,Great Shirt,"I was a bit skeptical to order a polo teamshirt online, but it was everything it should have been and it arrived ahead of time for my husband to where it to Cowboys stadium. Quality shirt,quality company, would buy again!"
5,great quality,Great quality. My husband really loves this shirt. The colors are strong and fabric is strong. This is a great addition to our Dallas collections.
5,Euge hits this one out of the park,After being mildly disappointed with his last release I was hoping Euge would not lose my interest. Well folks he hit this one out of the park. There is not a song on this CD that I do not enjoy. His work with Paul Brown always produces fiyah. I typically hate when vocals are allowed to muddy the CD but Ollie Woodson and Jeffery Osborne vocals with Euges sax is match made in heaven. I have played this CD over and over and I would have to put it right there with Living Large as my second best CD by Euge (his first is still my alltime favorite). I highly recommend this offering and look forward to his sweet sound in the future.Reggie
3,Tame.,I like a little more edgy groove. Don't want to feel like i'm sitting in an elevator waiting for something to happen. It's still on my stereo tho.
5,Awsome,"I love this CD, I heard one of the songs on Koky. I play it over and over. Good for relaxing with that special someone, or just driving down the road by your lonesome. Good work!!!!"
4,Smoothie,"Although it started a little tentative regarding ""groove"" I think it is a very good CD, especially the second half. Euge is an excellent stylist and has a distinctive foot-patting rif which sets him apart (very important). I believe his talent will enable us to enjoy his work for years to come."
5,Another Classic Album!!!!!!!,"Euge Groove does it again, y'all!!!! By far his best CD ever in my opinion. The smooth jazz genre as a whole has not fallen off at all for the past 5-10 years. It just seems every year, the genre gets better and better. Anyway, my favorite tracks are:1)-A Summer Night's Dream2)-Mr. Groove3)-Cafe Del Sol6)- Religify7)-Geez SpotIf these are your favorites too, keep 'em on repeat."
4,He did it again!!,"I Love Euge Groove. His latest CD is nice, much better than the last one, but not as good as his self-titled CD ""Euge Groove"". That one put him on the map in my book!!! Some tracks on this CD sound the same, but overall a nice listen."
4,A good starting point for game development,"Hi. First off, id like to state that I am by no means a professional programmer. I am a high school junior, who is currently working through AP computer science. I picked this book up on a trip as reading material, and it has been very informative. The code samples are extremely well written, and easy for me to follow. My only major critisim is that the printed code samples have several typos in them, but if you look through the code included on the cd, then you'll have no problems. Overall, I thought it was well worth the $36.00 I paid for it."
3,Interesting but flawed,Overall I find this a good book. It has interesting discussion and introduction of several topics that interest me. However it is flawed with typos and misstatements (sometimes contradicted in the next sentence). It's also fairly out of date now (JDK 1.5 comments are somewhat out of date now and JOAL comments are a bit out of date).Pick it up at a bargain price (under $5) and I do recommend it as a good book on JOAL and several other topics of value for Java programming (not just games).
2,Also found it disappointing,"I also found this book to be disappointing. I would also agree that the author sees it necessary to discuss the techniques involved rather than talk about a technique and then present the code for that technique.I bought this book on the basis that it was going to be ""practical"" programming, i.e techniques and code, but all i found was a long winded discussion on the topic. The author does show that he has a great knowledge of java game programming but it is poorly presented to the intermediate java programmer, and not recommendable to beginners.Do not buy this book if you think your going to be getting involved with code, rather, buy it if you do not know what techniques are used in java game programming, and wish to hear a discussion on those techniques."
4,Comments on Echelon,"Echelon is a most secret communications intercept and monitoring system on which little official information is available. The program provided an excellent overview of the intent and purposes of the Echelon Program, but perhaps more importantly, it revealed the vast scope and capability of the listening capabilites of this worldwide system. If anyone has any doubt if anyone is listening, this will provide a sense of reality to the fact that they are indeed listening. After watching the program you may not be a technical expert, but you will be a believer."
4,A great book.,"I've never read a book quite like this one, but I can appreciate the comparison to X-men and Wild Cards. On the one hand it feels almost like a young-adult novel, but it has just enough of a mature writing style that I didn't feel it was being ""written down"" at all. The characters are diverse and sympathetic, especially Lincoln. I also liked how the four characters in their three storylines moved around and through one another; I understand Andrews did something similar to this in his first book, Pandora's Game, which I definitely plan to read next. All in all, a very entertaining work of escapism that is also thought-provoking: What would YOU do if you were a paranormal? It tells us right at the end that a sequel is to come, and I for one am looking forward to it. Well done!"
4,Excellent Story/Horrible Editing,The story is great and really draws you in. It's hard to put down. It's Marvel's New Universe meets George RR Martin's Wild Cards. The only bad thing about this is the horrible editing. Whoever edited it should be fired. Sentences disappear halfway when turning pages. I have to keep changing the font size on my iPhone/iPad's Kindle app to view these disappearing sentences.Regardless of this one flaw I really enjoyed the book and look forward to reading more of this series. Rating this a 4 star only because of the extreme inconvenience of having to adjust the font size every 2-4 pages to read what is suppose to be there.
3,"""Paranormals"" -- a comic book tale brought to life","As Christopher's Mother, I read his books withpride. As a professional book and moviecritic, I read his books with an objective eye.""Paranormals"" is an interesting read. There'smystery, twists and plot turns, awesomecharacters and a stand up and cheer ending.If you're a comic book fan, this book isone you will especially enjoy. With shadesof ""X-Men,"" ""Paranormals"" leaves a vividpicture in your mind of extradorinary heroesthat become bigger than life. My favorite character in""Paranomrals"" has to be ""Powerhouse."" My favoriteauthor is Christopher Andrews. He's a geniousstory teller.Lynda Andrews"
4,Cute,"Cute costume. I figured no one else will have this. Careful though if you were expecting something flashy, it is real scrubs material. Also the stethoscope was really bent out of shape."
4,Uniforms of the Boxer Rebellion,"The color plates of this Osprey title are pretty good and illustrate the finer details of the equipment and uniforms of the various international contingents that fought during the Boxer Rebellion. The text is not bad, either, but space allows it only to give a brief overview of the historical situation. Like most men-at-arms titles pertaining to recent history, this is mostly a visual guide."
1,Spend your money elsewhere !!,"This is the worst reloading book I have ever seen. You'd be better off buying The Speer or Lyman books, as they are much more detailed and have a more extensive list of cartidges for reloading."
2,Fairly incomplete.,"This disc comprises two episodes of a series by Elaine MacGregor. Episode 1 is ""First Bake Your Cake"" - and the hostess and guest do manage to demonstrate some cake baking techniques, not a complete guide - but it certainly covers some basics. The second episode ""A Cake for all Reasons"" was mostly Ms. MacGregor show various cakes that can be baked and decorated for different occasions. And by showing I mean - there you go - finished cake. Very little technique demonstrated. There are apparently other episodes for more demonstration or were supposed to be, Ms. MacGregor references them in the videos, but where they are is a mystery. If you want a video guide that demonstrates cake decorating technique - look elsewhere."
2,Unhappy,"I was not aware that this DVD was 1 part of a whole series. It did not mention that, so when I got it, expecting to learn alot of things, I found that they would tell me ""and we covered this in the last DVD..."" so there was so much info I missed out on by not having seen the rest of the series. Was pretty disaapointed, do not think its worth it to buy the ENTIRE series to learn everything, much too pricy in these economic times."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this thinking my daughter would get a nice basic ""class"" on how to decorate a cake, using the piping, how to transport cakes, etc. I was not happy about this DVD, it was a huge letdown. Very incomplete."
1,Disappointing,"Not worth it, it's not an instructional DVD, just two people showing what they know about cake decorating. Even thought the price seems reasonable is not worth it."
5,A Story that Requires no Embellishment,"It's simple. Many subjects for film stemming from WWII are so compelling that they need not be altered by Hollywood to be palatable to large audiences. Yet with a few exceptions, the film industry can't resist not letting a great story based in fact rest on its own merits. 30 Seconds over Tokyo is a rare and refreshing exception to this general rule. It is an extremely accurate and gripping tale of the April 1942 Doolittle raid. What a great opportunity was lost with the abysmal ""Pearl Harbor"" movie....was the true story not compelling enough? And to add insult to injury they turned the Doolittle raid into ""Rambo 4""...2 injured bomber crewman slay 30 Japanese infantry with a .45! Please let me know when I can get ""30 Seconds over Tokyo"" on DVD. Why isn't it available on that format now???"
4,Great Wartime movie and personal story,"Thirty Seconds over Tokyo is not just about the attack on the Japanese less than 6 months after Pearl Harbor, but also the personal story of one of the pilots, Ted Lawson. Lawson was your typical guy, who became a pilot and volunteered for the mission, which resulted in a resounding moral success for the Allies. Lawson was wounded as a result of his crashing his plane in China.For those who have seen the movie, check out Tokyo during the raid. It looks suspiciously like Oakland, CA. I'm not sure, I wasn't born until way after the war. But it sure looks like it me.This film was made when the details of the raid were publicly known and it's a tribute to the men who flew that raid during those dark days of 1942."
4,Stirring Tale of True-Life Heroes,"There's no question the film is framed in a very straightforward, literal way, and that the characters are somewhat hokey All-American stereotypes.But I think to dismiss the film as simplistic is mistaken. Soon-to-be-Blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo includes some deft concepts of collective responsibility and moral tension, including not just the passage on civilian casualties, but also the exchange where the soldiers agree that that they don't hate the Japanese people.I would also recommend this disc for the special features -- a great short on bad movie etiquette, a vintage cartoon about a bear air raid warden, and a superb 15 minute documentary on the loss of the SS Normandie."
5,A classic,This is a gift for my husband who loves classic war movies. It's a fantastic addition for lovers of war films.
4,Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"Given a WWII movie made during the war (1944), it's very well done and fairly accurate. As with all US movies during WWII, it has a very patriotic pitch. This movie documents the tremendous morale boost the US needed with an incredible effort and sacrifice by all involved. One of the best true war movies made."
5,It's like you were a crew member on the bomb run!,"This video is outstanding! Once the Hollywood romantic story line is finished in the first part of the movie, the film becomes intensely realistic and exciting. After The Ruptured Duck takes off the Hornet, the camera gives you an incredible vantage point, almost like you are in the plane and seeing what these fellows saw. Hardly any dialogue takes place, just the droning of the plane's engine. The ending is touching and will bring you to tears when you realize the magnitude of the mission and the whole war itself!"
5,The flight of the Ruptured Duck,"This is a real intriguing back story to the1942 Doolittle Raid on Japan. It even feels like the real thing. We get involved with each little hiccup and problem of Ted Lawson (Van Johnson) as he not only has to prepare for the event but also preparing for another event in parallels as a soon to be father.Even though this is a van Johnson show, Phyllis Thaxter makes a good show as his wife. The part of Lieutenant Colonel James H. Doolittle is a memorable portrait by Spencer Tracy. Now I have to look up the real Doolittle to remember what he looked like.Needles to say we spend more than ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"" and still not enough time for the whole story."
4,electric fuel pump,"I rated this fuel pump 4 stars because there was quality. The picture that was with the pump in the listing is not correct. The pump does not come with the float assembly, you get just the pump . No big deal, the pump more than likely would have worked , but I was in need of the whole assembly."
3,Not enough parts for the job,"I just installed this in my 98 corolla. There was no replacement seal for the fuel tank to pump cover, none of the vibration covers were included, and the pump base vibration control spacer was wrong for my application. I had to reuse all of the existing parts that I just mentioned. . As a mechanic with 30+ years of experience I cannot recommend this product be installed by anyone but I qualified mechanic."
4,Freaky Tank,"I have to give this album 4 stars and not 5 because Tank's slammin' track that originally turned me onto him is lacking from the album. Entitled Freaky, the song should have been put on the album. That song really captures his ruffneck lady-lover image. Songs like Maybe I Deserve show you Tank's ability to stay modest while showing emotion. Force of Nature will make you wanna get Freaky and at the same time make you think about being a better person.Now, since Freaky was not included on this album - My demand is simple: Tank needs to have Tmberland remix the song WHAT WHAT WHAT adding a cameo of Nore, the founder of all the WHAT, WHAT ish. :)"
3,Maybe I deserved a better cd than I got,"I was disappointed by Tank's debut cd. Not that it was completely horrible, I just feel that it could have been better.It's not so bad, however, that if he makes a second cd that I won't consider buying it."
2,Not as expected,"The only song worth listening to is ""Maybe I Deserve"". I expected this CD to be the bomb, but it wasn't. Maybe I deserve to get my money back. If you like ""Maybe I Deserve"" please, just buy the single, you wont be disapointed."
2,rolll on tank,"not a bad debut, but not my thing either, if you like tank, and slow music this is for you."
4,Freaky Tank,"I have to give this album 4 stars and not 5 because Tank's slammin' track that originally turned me onto him is lacking from the album. Entitled Freaky, the song should have been put on the album. That song really captures his ruffneck lady-lover image. Songs like Maybe I Deserve show you Tank's ability to stay modest while showing emotion. Force of Nature will make you wanna get Freaky and at the same time make you think about being a better person.Now, since Freaky was not included on this album - My demand is simple: Tank needs to have Timberland remix the song WHAT WHAT WHAT adding a cameo of Nore, the founder of all the WHAT, WHAT ish. :)"
1,Put in in the Tank(garbage),"Unfornately for others, the best song on the CD is Maybe I Deserve. On this song, Tank shows great range as a vocalist and really stands out with something new from an R&B artist. As I listened to the rest of the cd, everything sounds the same. Its as if Tank has no clue of what he wants to do. If you like the single buy it, not the CD!"
2,Maybe I Deserve,"This ablum was not what I expected as the lady from the Bronx stated it was not ""tight"" at all. The only song that was cool, ""Maybe I Deserve"". So don't buy unless you have money to waste."
2,WHY???????,"I was scanning over this c.d. and a thought came to me, what the hell is TANK singing about. This c.d. is totally whack in every way. The c.d. sounds like he tried to write the songs himself. He has an o.k. voice but I think he should have taken the ghostwritter route. I really think that anyone wanting this c.d. change there mind because he sounds like he is an no limit or slip and slide artist."
3,craving more...,"That's what you'll be doing after listening to Force of Nature. Don't get it twisted, the prior reviewer who said that Tank's vocals are mediocre must be an instrumentalist. Any vocalists listening to the project definitely has some homework. I will say, however, that this is just the tip of the iceberg for Tank. Look for him to explore more of his artistic side and expose more of his ""soul"" in future offerings. He shows us on this project that he can do everything your favorite R&B artists can do... better than they can do it. Next album, we want to see what Durrell Babbs can do. Until then, the DC Metro will enjoy ""Tank"" and keep the project in high demand."
3,one distraction to consider,"I would agree with the accolades regarding recording quality and artistic beauty of this CD. I had only one problem which nagged at me and prompted a search of other recordings. Rafael Kubelik's tempo of the second poem (Vltava) is a bit fast, not allowing one to fully appreciate the wonderment of the opening lines of the flute. This may not bother most, but it is something a buyer might want to consider."
2,The Civil War; Volume 3: The Narrative Red River to Part B,"All three volumes of this excellent work, Part A.B.& C. are overpriced and a big dissapointment since it is not read by the author. Instead, the ranger from Jellystone Park from the Yogi Bear cartoon is assigned to the task. Extremely difficult to listen to. While the work itself is brilliant and a must have, the cassettes arrived in filthy condition (bottom of the bag?) and the whole point for spending the money for audio of this work was to hear Mr. Foote bring the history to life. Fans of the author will be greatly disappointed and I don't see any reason to recommend this to anyone."
4,In-depth look into Mexican politics,"You don't have to like Salinas or agree with his policies to appreciate this book. It is Salinas' first-hand explanation of everything that happened in Mexico once he became president--from privatization, to NAFTA, to his brother's scandals. If you have an interest in Latin American (especially Mexican) politics or economics, this is the story straight from the horse's mouth. The book is also valuable because, unlike North American and European politicians, Latin Americans tend not to write their autobiographies/memoirs and tell their stories themselves, so one is always left with so many questions about their decisions and their actions. Well here are the answers for Mexico since 1988, from Salinas himself."
1,Not at all like the picture,I just received this shipment of birthday rubber ducks. I open the package and was incredibly disappointed. These ducks are dirty with ink serial number all over them and not nearly the quality that is shown in the picture. I may have gotten a bad batch but my feeling is that they are NOT WORTH THE PRICE OR TIME!!!!!!
3,Fun but they float upside down!,I purchased these as little favors for the treat bags at my daughters party only to discover later that they capsize when placed in water. Lol! I would buy them again because they are cute although poorly painted. But she still enjoyed playing with them and that makes them worth it.
2,Mini,These are much smaller than I expected!They are still pretty cute and work for a small party favor bag as long as you don't plan for these to be your only favor. We didn't need them to float but they don't do that well. The bottom is printed with orientaltradingcompany.com which is a little tacky I thought but for the price these were still a fun addition to our party bags.
3,OK FOR PARTY FAVOR,these duckies are cute but poorly crafted i am using them for party favors so they should serve their purpose
3,So tiny...,"I didn't realize these were so tiny.. palm size, but we're putting these in the small goody bags so it should be OK. I would have loved it if it were a bit bigger or the other way around, small enough to use a cupcake toppers."
2,Adequate for goody bag,"These are the very small ducks and they are cute, but the paint job for the hats wasn't very good. I wanted something for a mixed age group of kids and thought these would be good. They were just okay."
2,Wow. Wasnt Worth it!!,I was really shocked by how small these actually were. And as other people have stated the paint job is horrible. I shouldnt have expected much but I expected a little more than what I recieved.
2,Not what I expected,"I bought these for my son's 1st birthday party as party favors but when they arrived, I realized how small they are and that his baby friends could bite the little ball off the top of the hat and possibly choke. This would make a cute cake decoration but that's about it."
4,Strong background on the current state of figure skating,This book was clearly prompted by the pairs skating debacle at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympic Games. Strong background on the promotion powerhouses that drive the elite level of the sport (likened to the studio system of Hollywood.) Lund provides a balanced framework in an essay format to let readers draw their own conclusions as to the future of the sport. Good quotes from skaters voicing opinions on both sides of the issues. An insightful retrospective on why skating went from double digit TV ratings in 1994 after the Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding scandal with umpteen made for TV pseudo competitions to the present state of a nearly non-existant professional figure skating circuit.
3,Really nothing new,In reading this book I got the distinct impression that the author compiled it from the many newspaper articles and skating magazines. Interviews with real skaters are included but there's really nothing new or different - fans of the sport and skaters are already familiar with these issues and discussions. Might be interesting for news fans of the sport
3,"Look its a Plane,No its bird,No its a GIANT BAT???",This is the first Gamera film I ever bought and to telly ou truth its wasn't that bad at all.I mean Gyaos looks dumb in a way but he gave Gamera the fight of his life.Thats the only reason its good because Gamera had a hard time defeating this Vampire.Gamera is still aim towards kids but they blood splattering from the monster and people being eating that I found pretty cool.But overal its alright Gamera film better thensome of the others.
2,"Great Action, Bad Special Effects","Fake special effects!! But hey, its good ol` Gamera battling a human-eating bat named Gaos to save the world. Gamera is now fully the good guy and Gaos is perhaps the most evil monster with the most battles against Gamera. Good movie!"
3,Bought as a gift,"I got this to give to a friend... It arrived on time, but I can't vouch for the actual quality of the movie!"
5,Excellent guide to the marine world,"A ""must have"" for both armchair and amateur naturalists with a keen interest in the marine world. I'm a scuba diver who lives in the Pacific Northwest but takes vacations around the world. The joy of this book is that it begins with the beginning--the origination of the oceans, including a bit of tectonic theory--and progresses to a detailed description of many of the genera in the oceanic realm. It's not a detailed guide to my particular corner of the world, but as a general guide to the world's oceans it can't be beat for both it's breadth and depth. This is a beginner's book with some real 'meat' to it! I highly recommend it."
5,If the information is followed -- It simply works!!!,"It is easy to understand, easy to follow, and full of God's word. I experienced some life-shattering events causing anxiety and depression. By following the instructions in the book, I was able to see the sunshine in my world again. Thank you Dr. Colbert."
2,Disorganized,I found this book to be poorly written and disorganized. It also mentions some products in general terms but never tells what the products are.
4,Great Value,"I'm not a financial analyst but I'm interested in analysing companies for my own investments. I found the book easy to read. It's a big eye-opener for someone who was not aware of all the accounting gimmicks that aggressive companies can play. I'm certainly a better investor now.That being said, please note that this book won't tell you much about what you need to do to value a company and invest in it. It will help you spot troublesome companies and accounting tricks that don't look right, but after that you're on your own. You need more than this book to be a good investor, but this book is a pretty important part of being a good investor."
2,Great qualitative explanations and horrible math derivations,"If you want to get a big picture on the analysis of financial statements, this is a wonderful book. However, I've gotten really frustrated as I progress onto the latter half of the book where the authors jump through multiple steps, do not provide detailed explanations about their calculations, and make outright mistakes about summation of geometric series in the dividend model."
2,Not worth the money,Very surface coverage...at about $1.00 per page you should get more in depth analysis. Entire format of the book is very strange.
4,"Another great, if long, lo-fi pop record from Graham Smith.","Graham Smith is back with his newest cd on March Records entitled ""Pony Oak."" While this cd isn't as throat grabbing as ""Graham Smith is the Coolest Person Alive"" on M.O.C. records, the hooks still abound just the same. The record has 25 tracks which makes it drag a bit at times. Smith does mix it up however, going from rollicking full band tunes, to quieter, and sparse acoustic ones. Though this disc is definitely in the ""lo-fi"" category, there has been a small notch forward in the recording quality. I happen to like hearing the hiss of the tape when a song is about to start however, so don't look for any studio production here. All in all, I think that this is a top notch record. The pop shines through and you will be humming these songs all day. I highly recommend this album."
3,Too egotistical for my tastes,"I was impressed by the song ""Tendency Right Foot Forward,"" which appeared on a March Records compilation in 1999. The song was absolutely fantastic...witty lyrics, catchy tune, thumping bass, and churning guitars. I thought if that song was that good, the whole album might be. I was wrong. Some of the songs on that album were such garbage, I couldn't even listen to them all the way through. I haven't bothered with any of his other albums because the kid's ego frankly bothers me. He asked ""Why do I write such great songs?"" My answer: You don't."
2,Preposterous title,"With an authoritative intention of being ""A Guide to the Forgotten Mystical Tradition of Jewish Meditation,"" and a price tag way above its content, this book falls short of its objective. The cultivation of ""kavannah,"" ""ratzon,"" ""m'sirah,"" and ""devekut"" is not as simple a task as has been set by the author. Meditation, be it Jewish or of any other denomination, requires more than just a few guidelines to avoid falling into the klippah of pride, distraction, guilt, and doubt. To place Avram Davis at the same level of Kierkergaard, Schopenhauer, or Spinoza is truly out of reality in terms of understanding the profound philosophy upon which Jewish Mysticism is grounded. This book is less than a ""Chicken Soup of Jewish Mysticism!"" If the purpose is to get a basic, good understanding of what Jewish Mysticism is all about, try Gershom Scholem, and from there move to others. It seems Avram Davis has not been able to avoid falling into the klippah of pride!"
4,Fascinating Story of Self-Destructive Twins,"Very good story based on the true life of a set of twins that were kinda freaky and off in a whole of their own. The writing is a little stiff, but I enjoyed and would recommend the book."
4,These capsules were great. They were small enough ...,These capsules were great. They were small enough that I had no problems swallowing them. They have so many wonderful health benefits that I plan to continue buying them for my family. Buying them from drugstore.com I know that they will always be quality products that I feel confident giving to my family.
3,This is a hard test product to rate. ...,"This is a hard test product to rate. I don't feel any different since I've been taking it, but I'll continue to take it until the bottle is empty and then maybe I'll know more. The capsules are quite large in size, so if you have problems taking large pills, you might want to reconsidering buying these."
1,I didn't like these pills at all. They ...,I didn't like these pills at all. They tasted horrid and didn't help me during the Test Drive period.
5,Awesome Price,"I've been buying a lot of cream of tarter lately, It's just one of the many ingredients in out play dough recipe... thank you for the great quality and price!"
5,Flawless Execution,"I bought the book, Flawless Execution through Amazon. Bam, zoom it was here. The whole process was painless. I got it used at a fantastic price.Flawless Execution: Use the Techniques and Systems of America's Fighter Pilots to Perform at Your Peak and Win the Battles of the Business [FLAWLESS EXECUTION]"
4,Military Strategy Turned Civilian,This book is an excellent recap of military strategy and tactic turned civilian. Murphy presents clear ideas on how these processes have been adapted for use in corporate life.Every CEO needs to read this book and make it required reading for his/her executives. The book is an easy read and gives multiple examples of how the processes can and are being used by Fortune 500 companies.
3,Not a reliable source for business knowledge.,"This guy can fly. That's it. He has ripped off and cut up John Wardens concept of business planning, system thinking etc. And he has added some things that fighter pilots do at the lower level.This book is about tactics, not strategy. The only intresting part of the book is the chapter about briefing. Nothing new here!And I would say that it is difficult to apply it to a regular business. The only business that could benefit from this concept is Consulting type of businesses and thats what theese AFTERBURNER guys does.Ok, it's worth a read. But leave it at that. This guy is a pilot trying to think business, don't be a businessman trying to think pilot.It is a tactical book. Apply if you want but I won't.However, John Wardens ideas and concepts are important. But that's another story. And read John Wardens books if you want to get into that..."
5,Read it! Do it!,"Flawless Execution isn't just another business self-help or continuous improvement book. Flawless Execution is a whole-organization improvement model based on specific, step-by-step processes - and it's an engaging read.What impresses me most about the concepts in this book is that they can be used in any business, organization, church, non-profit - and even in your everyday life. I'm implementing it today."
1,The writing almost ruined the story,"I'd suggest that Ralph Helfer hire a professional writer to get him through the next account of his interaction with exotic animals. Although I'm an avid animal lover, enjoyed the unique perspective and experience related in Mr. Helfer's story, I'd be hard pressed to say that it wasn't difficult to wade through the sometimes smarmy, Liberace-style of writing that detracted from the essence of his message. Had Zamba been a literary critic, he'd have turned on Helfer before he was a year old!"
5,Page Turner!!!!!,Was looking for this book for awhile & I finally got it & boy did I enjoy reading it! I couldn't put it down & was so sad when I reached the end. I wanted more! I also learned that all animals require love & tons of patience. An animal will do anything for you just to make you happy if you earn it's trust & respect.
3,"Works okay, but I've had better","It provides some support for you neck, but I was hoping for more firm support. For example, if I am standing and if I have the neck brace on, when I relax my neck muscles, my neck still leans forward to the extent that my eyes are still almost looking at my toes."
5,Decent Quality for the Price!,"These are solid bags! The quality is wonderful for the price spent. I used amazon's ""Will it fit"" on my 06 Harley Davidson XL883C sporter. The bags needed altered significantly for the proper throw over but still look and are placed wonderfully on my bike. Though I would recommend to others looking at these for the same year and model as me to look into something differently. The alterations required me to use old leather straps to fit properly, the fabricated flaps were wayy too short."
5,More Marvelous Mazes,"This book is pegged for children ages 3 - 5, and that seems about right. My three year old son had a blast working these delightful (and sometimes challenging) mazes. There are 80 mazes in the book, and there is a certificate of achievement at the back of the book.Highly recommended."
5,If you like old school horror buy this.,"This is an old school horror movie that I saw on HBO as a kid. I paid a pretty penny for it on amazon, but it was worth it. Great stories, good acting, good horror. This is back when people use to put effort into there movies."
3,"A little too political to be a really ""fun"" horror film for me","One could argue (and they may well be correct) that the horrific images shown in photo form in this good film are ""horror"" . At nearly fifty years of age , i've seen most of the photos shown toward the end of this otherwise quite enjoyable and winning horror picture . The images are indeed horrific and a whole lot more . This is a horror anthology though , and i'm not quite sure they belong in this film . The whole last story strikes me as not having the ""fun"" congruity of the other stories show here . It feels as if the picture morphs from making some good points and being scary and fun to becoming militant . That written , i could recommend much of the film as a smart , street take on horror anthologies of old . Mr. Williams is outstanding and often hilarious as our funeral home tour guide . The young actors are solid as the street toughs they portray . What's your take ?"
4,Good Stuff,"While crusing the horror section of the video store, I stumbled across this. Me. being a sucker of Comedy/Horror flicks, could not resist. I must say I was not disapointed. The issues adressed in this film are strong, and worth seeing, and Clarence Williams provides the comic relief. Good movie. Worth 4 stars."
3,if you thought this movie wasn't scary..,"if you thought this movie wasn't scary you should have been the only white person in a theater with only African Americans. didn't help that i heard someone say ""stupid white boy"" as i walked to my seat. i was ducking down when the raciest white guy was on the screen."
2,Just a movie,Old movie seen in high school and wanted to see it again and was cheaper then renting it.
5,One of the best ever.,I am a huge horror fan and I would strongly reccomend this movie title for any true horror fan. I consider this to be a true classic horror film.
3,"Good, but not what I had hoped for","Given the players involved - Bob Daisley, Eric Singer, and of course David Glen Eisley - I expected a bit more from Stream. The band's 1999 album Nothing is Sacred is a solid hard rock album, but it is decidedly unmelodic. I wasn't necessarily expecting it to sound like a Giuffria album, but I thought that with Eisley on vocals it would have some more melodic elements.That being said, Nothing is Sacred is still a good hard rock album. The band makes no attempt to imitate grunge or nu-metal, instead concentrating on hard driving, heavy rock & roll. Good stuff, but not all that memorable. You probably won't find yourself humming a Stream tune after listening to the album."
1,Skip it,"A primer on what's wrong with contemporary American fiction. Okay, you're from the South, but that doesn't make you a good writer. All surface, prose pyrotechnics and slick phraseology...no real characters, story, plot or substance. Reads like a compendium of the worst of college grad student family blues MFA program pap. Faulkner, Hemingway, John O'Hara, Cheever, Flannery O'Conner...even contemporaries like T. Coraghessen Boyle outshine this turkey."
4,Not a Collection of Southern Stories to Miss,"As a former fiction writing student of Mr. Phillips, this book gives me new insight to his often repeated words of wisdom, ""Write what you know."" I must agree with another reviewer who said that these stories might be more enjoyable if read seperately, grouped together they provide us with sense of dread and a complete picture of the inescapable life of Richard. Most of the stories were printed seperately at first as short stories in magazines and they lose something if read in chronological order.Still, My People's Waltz showcases the extraordinary talent of Dale Phillips and his slant on the Southern fiction writer. The stories each draw you into to the characters' lives and force you to care for them, while the sad humor attempts to lighten the underlying message."
5,"A collection of excellent, moving stories.","Dale Ray Phillips is a great voice in American fiction. Summing up the life of the character he calls Richard, Dale Ray breaks into the broken human heart like a burglar and finds the lost riches there. His characters are lost, deaf, and knowingly unholy in a landscape of mischance, love, and unbearable knowledge. Fathers betray sons as naturally as crappies bite hooks, and lovers try to force each other into different shapes. A forceful collection of stories."
5,Excellent compact tripod for small cameras,"This tripod is very well made, sturdy and easy to setup. The small size makes it great for carrying in a backpack.It works very well for small compact digital cameras. The ballhead does not need tightening every time you position it which is a handy feature.It has the quality I expected from Bogen."
3,The Man behind the badge,A fairly well written biography of one of Americas most loved and alsomost parodied TV cops. A good insight into the man behind the myth with lots of photographs. Things may not always be phrased just right in the book but you will come away with a greater understanding of Webb the man and perhaps even a greater appreciation of his work. For Webb fans a definite read.
3,Mediocre,As with most authorized biographies this one is a little too fawning. I would like to compare it too a more balanced look at Jack.
3,not quite the celtic knot,"The work of the incising of the braiding was not as deeply engraved as in the picture. It was very inexpensive, so I guess I got what I paid for. I like the ring, but it is not as well done as the picture portrays."
3,Durability Questionable,"These were recieved as a gift for Christmas. They are comfortable and look good but now, 10 weeks later, they are literally falling apart at the seams. The heel where the insole meets the outer sole are seperating readily. This is the second pair I ordered. The first lasted almost an entire year. It appears the quality is going down."
1,Beware of this pressing,I have Sanderling's other set of Brahms and like it very much. This one has wow and is very much out-of-focus. Very disappointing. (My equipment is first-class.) I'd like to hear from someone who has a clean copy.
2,"Good book, sticky pages","Excellent book, but came with several pages stuck together which, needless to say, ended up damaging the book as soon as I tried to separate them. Other than that, pretty good product."
4,"""Great book about Socrates, with illustrations even adults might enjoy""","Well I checked this book out from the library not seeing the cover or looking into details about what audience is was directed at. Although it's for kids, I still read the book and found it entertaining at the least. This would be a better book to read to a kid rather than the generic ""Three Little Pigs"" or what other hog wash we like to read to our children.Great book."
4,Fun Fiction,"This is a fun and fast paced World War 2 based current day book that actually works. The author has the CIA, the Mossad and the Stasi all after some old masters that were stolen by guess whom? The author has done a good job here, the characters are well developed and there are enough sub plots to keep you interested but not to overwhelm the central story. I was concerned with the number of people running around, maybe dropping a few would have done the book good and the biggest issue I have is the love story. Why have this in the book? It is not needed, rushed and just done poorly. Overall I thought the book was above average and interesting."
4,A very engaging thriller!,"This is the first book I've read by J.C. Pollock, and I thought it was a well-worthwhile and entertaining thriller. Perfect for a rainy day. When an old, forgotten S.S. officer passes away, his son comes into possession of a list of art sales Herman Goering made to various art collectors. A former Soviet-spy and terrorist, the son sees the value of the list as a way of filling his bank account by stealing the art himself. What he doesn't see is the true value of the list, and that leads much of the world to chase him down. A definite read."
2,Predictable banal plot,"The love interest is so thin, so predictable. The plot is too implausible: it's so easy to find the bad guy, but so hard to eliminate him."
3,Free Shipping,"I was supposed to receive free shipping for this order but was charged $10.00, which was more than the purchase price of the two swypers. I attempted to contacted Amazon and the shipper but did not receive a response. I am so disgusted I may never order from Amazon again."
1,Steer clear,"Bad movie about bad movies, made by bad people from an unfortunate time in underground film. Enough with the glorification of the losers around Warhol's 'Factory'. An inch deep by a mile wide unfunny misogyny. Knowing you're unfunny doesn't make it alright."
4,Had this book for a minute.... put it down.. and picked it up,I am so happy that i decided to finish this book. I started it about a year and a half ago. Moved and misplaced it. I found it about 3 months ago but I had started reading other books and after reading a dissapointing book recently (won't say any names lol ) I decided to give it a chance.This book was good. I was surprised.
5,A Classy Christmas Album,"I purchased this CD in the early 90's and it has earned a place in my heart that no other cd has earned. The King's Singers, Kathleen Battle, and others, provide a breadth of beauty from renditions from Handel's Messiah, to English traditional Christmas music. This is no album featuring obnoxious Christmas music, which we hear blaring in countless stores in the season. It is an expression of true joy!"
4,THIS IS A BIG MESSENGER BAG,"I just purchased this leather bag for my VAIO VGN-SZ480. The bag is very nice (in fact it is really a padded bag that goes within the leather bag shown on the picture) but it is large. It has plenty of handy pockets in the front (which unzips for easier access) for computer accessories and other gizmos. It also has a pull-out hidden slot in the rear (top) of the bag for your airline ticket and passport (which could be handy if you are traveling and don't want to carry a briefcase). Overall, the quality appears top notch (like the two other VAIO bags I own) and this should be a winner. Did I mention it was a LARGE bag?"
4,Christmas gift for my Grandaughter,"She was excited to get it, but hasn't had a chance to play the game yet. She didn't have her Leapster with."
5,Son loves his mouse game,"Although my son has never seen the movie, he loves this game and always asks to play the mouse game. Great learning and fun for him and keeps him busy when I am doing mom stuff around the house or driving. Great price."
3,"Cute but boring, not very educational","My son does not ejoy this learning game as much as spongebob, thomas and sonic. The games appear to be boring and can not keep a childs attention."
4,Great collection,This is one of the better horror collections in a while. Just about all of the stories provide the requisite goosebumps of creepy tales. Ranks up there with some of King's/Bachman's collections. Be sure to check out the boy that runs on electricity. Great addition to any good horror collection.
3,Toybox of Irony,"I have to say, after the grand forward, I was expecting more from these stories. A lot of them left me feeling like a Reader's Digest version of a Twilight Zone episode.I didn't think most of the stories were long enough. Yes, it's a short story anthology, but I think more could have been gotten out of the some stories if they were longer.Most of them weren't particularly scary having a Twilight Zone type twist at the end instead. Having read it a couple days ago, only two or three stories really stick out in my mind.If you need something to read to kill the time, it's worth a look."
3,D'OH !,I have read and been a fan of Sarrantonio and his Orangefield series from the beginning. And perhaps that led to a level of expectancy that this book just couldn't deliver. I feel as though several stories seemed unfinished or not fleshed out to what they could have been. Most of the stories were unsatisfying and left me disappointed.
2,A Disappointment For This Fan of His Novels,"I am always happy to locate an Al Sarrantonio book. I have truly enjoyed his novels. This is his first collection of short fiction. I had to read it right away, but I wound up being disappointed.Short horror fiction is often far mor intense than horror novels, but that is not the case with this collection. At best the stories are odd. Usually they are just dull. I found myself reading the stories in hopes of finding the gem in the collection. There was none. This was very odd as I could relate to many of the characters.All in all I have to say that fans of his novels may want to pass this collection by as the stories within bear little resemblance to his longer works."
1,Very Weak don't waste your money.,Don't waste your money on this book. Definitely not worth the effort to read it. the best stories in this book are sub par at best. Just read a stephen King book you have not read yet if you want a read a real book.
2,NOT waterproof!!!,"My daughter lovs music and received this as a birthday gift. Loved the music and songs it played! We put it in water for 10 minutes and it has never played since!! The battery compartment obviously had water in it - NOT waterproof!! We are still trying to dry it out, hoping to revive it!"
3,Somewhat of a let down,"Splashy the penguin, more like trashy the penguin.My daughter doesn't really play with it. I was really excited about this toy when I purchased it for my daughter for Christmas. She seems somewhat uninterested in it. She is 20 months old and plays with other things in the tub, like cups, and small figure toys, but she hasn't shown much interest in this toy. I am somewhat let down. The toy is made well though."
4,Exceptional Recording,"I would disagree with the previous review only in the respect that you don't need to know French to enjoy this recording. GCM's voice is rich and resonant, and often he delivers a polished type of acid jazz that readily recalls Guru on his best ""Jazzmatazz"" recordings.At best, it is a beautiful, taut, and fast paced; however, it does have a few looser, rambling tracks."
2,Chess Mysteries of the Arabian Nights,"This is a very entertaining book but the editing was quite poor. The author is very clever, but he has set up some impossible situations i.e., one side will have 17 pieces, etc. In the first 11 problems, I found four such mistakes. It may be that this has been discovered by the author or publisher, and the book is out of print for that reason."
2,"Cool writing, hard to use","The book has wit, and some useful info, but in an attempt to make it too cool it is virtually impossible to really find what you are looking for, and harder even to look for stuff you don't already know it exists. Skip the book, get a reverent guide that will give you more info."
4,A wonderful Sephardic Memoir,"The Maimon books is a fantastic trip back to the old days. It is essay upon essay of religion, culture, experiences, or just musings all related to Sephardic life. The Maimon family are related to the RaMBaM, Maimonides, and hail from Turkey, though today they are Scaterred from Seattle to New York to Jerusalem. In this book Sam Maimon takes you on a flight of memories, ones which we can all relate too. It will make you proud, it might even put a happy tear in your eye, but either way it will help you remember always your Sephardic culture..."
4,10 # Propane Tank,Received as advertised. With Amazon free shipping was the best deal. Item received in good condition and free of defects. Would buy again with free Amazon shipping if available due to my shipping location.
1,Too small,I have actually been trying to return this tank as it is not easy to find a fill up location for this small tank in my area. I havent heard back from the sender?
4,Low profile ropane tank,Shipping tracking and delivery of product was exactly as described. This tank should be perfect for the fire pit application that I purchased it for. Easy to carry and it fits below the profile of the fire pit so that it won't disrupt the seating.
5,Impossible to find elsewhere.,What a score! This little guy fits in tiny places while offering a great step up from the little disposable camping tanks without the weight and bulk of the normal bbq types.
5,a much needed music change for the nations airwaves,"This group, Matchbox 20, is a great relief to music listeners of more than one age category. With their first album release already hitting the platinum level ( and of course how could it not with 5 of the first 6 songs making it into the top 10 or better ont he music charts), it is no wonder that this band is indeed headed in the right direction to being one of todays premier bands....if you have not checked out this album..I encourage you to do so as soon as you possibly can, i personally gaurentee that you will love this album if you are like most of us and tired of the normal pop radio"
2,i switched off it,"dog had diarrea constantly for more than 4 weeks, switched to candidae and 1st day he was back to normal. gonna stay on candidae"
3,Runny Stools,"Although this food does have good quality ingredients, my German Shepherd never really had any solid stools while on it. While switching him to this food, he had diarrhea even though I switched him over VERY slowly. I still stayed with the food thinking that the diarrhea had to do with switching the main meat component from lamb to chicken. After three months on it though, his stools are still mostly runny. I have since change to the Taste of the Wild which he actually love to eat (it smells pretty good too) and his stools are improving. This does not mean that Blue Buffalo is not a good choice for your dog. Rather I would try it out and see how your dog does on it. If you find that their stools are not improving then switch."
1,"Meh on ""life source bits""","One of my three dogs won't eat the ""life source bits"" so she's constantly spitting them out hence we have life source bits all over the flippin' house. Won't be buying it again."
1,I agree with Pepi- this book is written for children,"CNC Workshop does an injustice to the trade of precision machining. If CNC programming was a simple as it is portrayed here, any monkey could do it..This book has missed about 80% of CNC programming facts and theory, and the 20% that is present is littered with errors.Smid's book is far superior, as is Mike Lynch's work.The CD that comes with this book crashes easily and the G-code do not represent true CNC commands (only vague movements.)"
1,Software messes up computer,"The software installs ok - although it makes you install Microsoft VM (MSFT's version of Java that they were forced to recall after litigation), and disable Sun Java. This may not matter to some as not too may websites are written in Java anymore - they use Flash. it really bothers me that I was forced to install an archaic, unsupported JVM to run this program.The book did it's job - it taught me the basics of G-Code. I was disappointed that the simulator did not understand some g-codes and required spaces between each parameter.I wish I read the previous reviews - I would have saved $50. Now to fix my computer . . ."
3,Venice Beach of the 70's,"A must see for lovers of 1970's interior design. As a bonus you have a character, powerfully played by Millie Perkins, whose confusion of reality becomes our confusion as viewers, wonderfully so. I don't think anyone can quite fully explain this one. Attempts at feminist revenge generalizations fall short quickly. It must be experienced first hand."
4,Cool Collection Of Surf Tunes,"I bought this collection album on a whim, not knowing the song's listed on the album, but thought I'd take a chance. It turned out to be good! There are definately some good 'old & new' surf tunes to check out here. For a laugh, check out one of the earliest Frank Zappa recordings presented on this album, ""Mr. Guy""/""Letter From Jeepers""(two names for one song. Who would of thought Zappa would turn up on a collection of 'Surf Music'!"
2,TR-3 plastic model,"A fairly good representation of a TR-3 . however, the model lacks detail, like a blurry word, you can see it but you have to think, a bit, to find out what it says'"
4,good but lacking website!,this book offers a great 'perspective on the past' but i have been unable to find a site on the internet that deals specifically with material in this text book.
1,Disappointed - Not as pictured,Photo shows the product with flip top bottles. The product delivered with only snap top bottles. These leak with pressurization and depressurization of airplanes. It would have been nice if they'd at least provided a mix.
3,Not sure what to get?,"Well, here's the thing. I use about 1/4 of the bottles it comes with and the case, which is perfect. I store my own toiletries in here also (made room by removing excess bottles). The hotels usually have their own shampoos and soaps. As far as quality: could be better. If I had the option of doing it all over again: would just buy a toiletry case/bag to carry my own stuff, which you can just about find in travel sizes anyways."
1,Blower Motor,"This is not a blower moter for a 1996 Nissan pickup, or if it is it is only half of one. The wiring plug is missing, so there is no way to connect it without cutting into the wiring harness. This is a bad item."
5,Beautiful... Inventive...,I found this book in our school library and was stunned by the artwork. I work in a school where the deaf children are mainstreamed into the school. Sign language books are always checked out! This is a big hit with the young students. I give the author an A+ for an excellent book!
5,Great Style and Great Games forming Great Lessons!,"I enjoyed going over every game in ""More Unbeatable Chess for Juniors"". Like in the authors previous book, ""Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors"" this book contains a good number of the authors games that he knows best. It also contains a lot of excellent games used once again in actual lessons given by the author. Only having this experience can give a deep insight into what is going on in the mind of the student. The analysis is very accurate, and the author does a fantastic job of telling what is going on in the games. Every move has commentary. This book continues where ""Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors"" off and fills in the gaps by providing another 24 games that contain in depth coverage of excellent openings. This is a must buy for any serious chess student wanting to improve there game and part a a great series by this author."
4,Eclectic Diversity Personified.,WOW! This is the most eclectically diverse collection I've seen any studio release. 4 stars for the audacity. I can't think of any one I know who would have an interest in a collaboration of all these movies together though.
1,missing blade,i ordered on 12-10-11 and i still have not recieved the itemThis is the first time ordering thru Amazon and and it does not look goodI do not know what to do????
5,Eminem-the slim shady LP,this album is DABOMB I cant stop listenin 2 it Im even listenin 2 it right now ! soo if your thinkin about gettin think dont even think twice ! JUST BUY IT ! =)
5,The Bomb,I seen M in concert twice and it was all good baby-baby! His c.d is worth getting F*** the Source!! FL. has much love for you
2,Don't let the smooth taste fool you!!!,"I'm a big fan of White hip-hop. I bought this single in anticipation that a new White rapper was on the scene. I was initally impressed with the single so I bought the alblum. MISTAKE. Eminem is good for battle rhymes and that's it. When it comes to whole alblums, he stretches for material and subject matter, like rhyming about stuff he knows not what sells. So, if you want the best of Eminem, buy this single and leave it at that..."
5,You can't sleep on this kid.......,"All I gotta say is that this is the phattest thing I've heard in a long, long time. Check the album on 2/23/99. Don't sleep, ya'll."
4,What a great song.,"This kid has really got some talent. His whole album has white kids AND black kids bumping. Yo, this kid is way off the hook. Incredible. He's sooo funny too. I haven't seen rap this good in a long time (and we need more respected white rappers because it seems that many white kids aren't fans of rap. I think it is due to under-exposure). EMINEM IS JOHN BLAZE!!!!!!"

5,Me neither.,Eminem is one of the only people out there today that tells it like it is. What I like most about him is that he doesn't try to kiss up on everybody just because he's a white guy trying to rap.
4,A good collection for newcomers,"An excellent collection if you are new to the series. This book includes some of the best stories from the Tales Trilogies. The best stories are those by Weis&Hickman and Berberick. Altogether, a great introduction to the magical world of Krynn."
4,An Uplifting Story,"Beware. This is a heartwarming story with a strong Christian message. That is the strong point of the movie. Some people will find that a ""turn-off"". I didn't. I found the story very uplifting, despite its ""preachy"" tone. The acting is a weakpoint. Some performances were credible; others seemed amateurish. A low-budget film with a wholesome message."
2,dougv,"Interesting to see some Chinese scenery and culture.The movie is slow moving.My main concern is that the lines and characters are too sweet or sugary. Most of the Christians don't seem real: toomany smiles and they were overly nice.The main character, Jenna, was naive. A little research by her on the present day China would show they are totalitarian.I don't recommend you see this movie."
2,"Granted, it's a fictional story...","While the acting and direction are good, the production is not. This movie looks like it was shot with a home video camera (although the soundtrack was OK). Worst is the script. My 8 year old loved it, but it got only scorn from those over 11 in my house. Implausible even if it did reflect reality in China, which it does not. There is a real danger that because it so blatantly mis-represents the reality of orphans, Christians, and the Chinese government, that some will conclude that the well-documented persecution of Christians is also a fairy tale. I cringe to think there are people who might believe this movie represents reality. (...)"
2,"passable, but poorly made","This movie says on its cover ""inspired by a true story."" This is not the case, it concludes with the standard tag line of ""any similarity to real persons is coincidental..."" I enjoy watching Christian films, and I did enjoy watching this one, with its positive moral values. I liked the positive view it gives of adoption. I may even add it to my collection (I watched it as a rental). However, the production values were low, and the acting wasn't very good. The plot details were not very true to reality in China. The Chinese do face terrible persecution, but this story was not very believable. Some of the situations in the movie are a bit confusing. Hopefully the makers of this film will get better at their trade."
2,Overall average item...,I would probably not purchase a again. Overall looks are great but quality and duribility are not there!! Not bad for the price!
5,A must have for any trip to Paris!,"I lived in Paris for a year as an American college student in 1985. This little book went with me every single day and as I found out even the French, police and the life long Parisians carried it with them. So know I am going back 20 years later and the first thing I did was buy a new copy!"
5,Great!,"This book was recommended by a friend and it is wonderful, it has come in handy. I would definately recommend this book to someone...."
5,Doug Cameron,"Absolutely wonderful CD. Doug is a magnificent violinist, but this CD is top notch! I am ready to go to Ireland now!"
4,It seemed like I was taking a lot ...,It seemed like I was taking a lot of pills (six a day) but I did notice an increase in the level of my energy. I'd prefer to take a single multi-vitamin but this product had a better effect on me than any multi-vitamin that I've tried. I'll probably order more of them.
1,Not very good,This movie was very poor quality. Poor production and slow story line. I do not recommend this movie at all. Don't bother to rent or buy.
3,uneven performance of a masterpiece,"Zelenka is a woefully neglected composer whose music deserves to be heard far more often than it is. This performance is not bad, the trumpets (the score call for 4) are a bit overpowering as modern D and F-trumpets are used (trumpets in the Baroque era sounded more like woodwinds and blended with strings and voices quite easily), the motets seem under-rehearsed.But, one can hear the quality of the music easily enough, so if you want to acquaint yourself with another Baroque master who isn't Bach, Handel, or Vivaldi, Zelenka is a good one to start with."
5,The Best Variety of Chex Mix,"Only the best Chex Mix out there. Full of distinct flavor, this mix combines the subtle sweetness of honey-roasted peanuts with a bold flavoring which coats the other ingredients of this snack. A snacker can easily devour an entire bag at one sitting. The only problem is that this snack can be somewhat difficult to find."
4,Good for homeschooling,"This series is a superb synopsis of American history. Examines both sides of issues, relates the backstory rationale for events and what was occurring elsewhere simultaneously. Finding myself as the mom/teacher caught up in the stories as well. Only complaints: some overlap between books instead of completely linear; and wish there were a study guide/TM and tests.Using with other ""living history"" books/bios, and a wall timeline. Had tried Hakim's history ""History of US"" series (too dead-white-Christian-male bashing and too many inaccuracies) and History Channel's ""A History of America"" DVD (too revisionist). This series makes the facts interesting and relative."
4,Nice book with basic info and beautiful ideas,"I just recently fell in love with succulent plants, so my husband bought me this book (and a few others) for Christmas. I enjoy leafing through it for ideas. It has lots of beautiful photos with ideas for growing succulents and cactus. The book is about 100 pages and when you open it up, most pages have a full-page photo on one side and text on the other. The text discusses some background info on the plants pictured and a ""How to do it"" section that describes the plants needs. One thing I really like about this book is that as you page through the book, the pages that cover specific plants have a summary of info of that plant in the margin. This always includes the basic info you need - light, watering, fertilizing, etc.This book isn't as in-depth as some, but it's more of an idea book. It has photos of plants both indoors and out. It's a great basic info & idea book for the beginner."
4,AZ transplant from Kansas,I eat up any books on cactus because being from Kansas I think they are some of the coolest plants you can grow here in Arizona. I killed a few at first and now I know what I did wrong... water! lots of water! Now that I am getting into growing all kinds of cactus and succulents I am always curious about new kinds that I can grow. This book is both helpful and nice to look at.
5,Beautiful!,"This CD is absolutely beautiful. From the first time I heard The Sweetest Sounds, the very first song, I knew this CD would be one of my favorites. Each song is unique and wonderful in its own way. There are some melancholy, haunting songs and also some upbeat and humorous songs. This is defintitely a CD you'll listen to over and over, and the songs will soon be stuck in your head. Before you know it you'll have memorized the words and will be singing along- it's that good!"
3,Good movie/Not Great Copy,This movie stars the likeable Jim Hutton in a made for TV mystery. He plays a a small town DA trying to deal with two tough cases. Its a good movie with good supporting cast including Ed Asner. Only drawback is that the copy of movie has some obvious flaws- so picture image is not first rate- not up to modern standards we are all used to. Its a shame cause otherwise movie is a treat. I got by the problem to still enjoy the movie- if you can do the same- you will too- but be warned.
3,Please read the description and reviews before buying!,"As a product, this was not bad. It was a pretty engaging mystery based on of one of Erle Stanley Gardner's characters. I had never seen any other charcter of his on the screen besides Perry Mason. The Star rating is for the quality of the video. As the previous reviewer noted the video quality is questionable at best. It is still watchable though.As to why this product comes up in Ellery Queen search results, more than likely it is because they share the same actor (Jim Hutton). I received this as a gift after asking for the Ellery Queen mysteries and figured the gift giver got caught up in only viewing the search results. I am going to keep this gift since I do like it and Erle's work, but I will be ordering Ellery Queen mysteries."
2,Old Movie,The movie was a little hard to watch. The restoration was not done well and many of the scenes were either very dark or very fuzzy. It was fun to see it again but it is probably too hard on my eyes to watch to again.
1,ELLERY QUEEN RIP-OFF,"I BOUGHT THIS TRIPE WHILE SEARCHING FOR ELLERY QUEEN EPISODES OF THE TV SERIES. IT WAS LISTED UNDER THAT CATEGORY.IT IS NOT.THIS GARBAGE HAS JIM HUTTON PLAYING SOME UNKNOWN CHARACTER, IN SOME DRAB, UNINTERESTING TV MOVIE.IT IS CLASSIC ""BAIT AND SWITCH."""
4,A great addition to my collection of aviation books.,This is a very nice edition that covers a more specific list of flying boats in that it is just U.S. aircraft discussed. Well written and lots of pictures to illustrate the various models of flying boats covered. I appreciate the information presented on each of the various models listed and found it very informative. A very nice book from a collectors standpoint.
5,Unique and Harmonious,"Head Cleaner is a good CD. It's style is unique. The tracks are diverse and are full of different ranges of styles. The music has a nice percussive beat and the lyrics are at times interesting and at other times profound. All in all, I found Head Cleaner to have a refreshingly new sound. I liked ""I Love My Body"" and ""Faith"" most, but each track has its shining moments."
5,Excellent Book! Warning for SoCal LLCs,"This book is great, very clear, easy to read, and lays out the process step by step. I highly recommend it! I don't have anything to add that hasn't been said, EXCEPT:LLC applicants in SoCal: you CANNOT reserve an LLC name in person at the Los Angeles Secretary of State!The SOS does not announce this anywhere on their website, and the form itself, downloaded from the SOS site, directs you to file your LLC name reservation at the LA office. Since the SOS doesn't announce this, it's not in the book (but thru no fault of NOLO). I found out the hard way by schlepping to the SOS office, taking my number, sitting in a beat up dirty chair and waiting to be called, then being told that I'd have to file my reservation via mail.I will post back if I run into further problems."
1,Bad radio reception. Very large,"The radio reception was very poor. It also was much bigger than it seemed on the website. When used with an iPod, the sound quality is very good."
4,ipod under cabnet,"Product is good as advertised. Works great with any ipod. Also has FM radio and weather radio. My one complaint is that sometimes it comes on when I use another remote in the kitchen and the weather radio buzzes when there is a weather alert, rather than just coming on with the information. Other than these pet peeves it is a good product to play your ipod in the kitchen. Sound is good and it is very easy to use. Mounting the product was not easy, but that would be true for other kitchen mounted radios."
4,Great product - but install is a little tricky,"Overall this is a great product. The space-saving assembly is wonderful. The speakers are surprisingly amazing - we can hit the bass or amp the treble. The only problem with it is that installation is a *huge* pain. It does require power tools and a basic grasp of handy-man know-how. It's not overly-complicated, but be prepared with a power drill. It's not 'out of the box ready-to-go.'"
5,Fabulous I pod dock,"This is one of the best appliances I have ever bought due to its fantastic price. So cheap, I thought it was an error. I bought the ipod dock from Bose. I paid $300 for it. When I received my iHome under the counter ipod player two days later, I couldn't believe the quality of its sound. It's so good that I returned the Bose one and I'm looking forward to get another one for my bedroom. I highly recommend this product. You won't be disppointed, believe me.Carmen Carattini"
2,"Nice, but doesn't last","I bought this for Christmas of 2006. It worked great for about 11 months then all of a sudden the iPod stopped worked when the drawer was open. The door had to be closed for it to work. THen it stopped playing sound through the right speaker and now doesn't work at all. Radio reception dropped off to just about nothing and 2 different iPods won't work at all. I was really happy when we bought it, but for the money, it should have lasted longer than 11 months. Just be careful."
4,Works as advertised,I received this radio and had it installed in less than 30 minutes. Cabinet templates were easy to understand and very helpful. I like how you don't have to have the iPod out to listen to your songs. When the iPod is stored inside the unit the artist and song information is displayed on the LCD screen.
4,very nice,"I really like this product. It was easy to install, set radio pre-sets, clock etc & very compatible with my ipod. I would recommend this product if this is something you need."
3,Surprisingly Good Sound (& Small),"When I opened up the box, I was surprised (and almost scared) at how small it is. However, when I hooked it up I was pleasantly surprised by the sound. It fills up my kitchen more than I would have expected - and will probably lead to me spending a lot more time in there.HOWEVER, I'm mystified as to why it doesn't have an AM tuner...would have been four stars, otherwise."
2,Clicking Noise,I recently bought a IH36W at a brick and mortar store and this unit also has the faint clicking noise as the screen refreshes/scrolls (mentioned a few comments below). I hear it in the background at most volume levels. Be warned!!! I will switch my unit with another tomorrow to see if it's any better.
2,Do not buy if you have an 8 gig nano,This device does not work with an 8 gig nano and Ihome will not return my emails. I will not be buying Ihome products in the future.
5,Under-Counter iPod Player,"This product is value packed. The product fits extremely well under my cabinet. All of my iPods and shuffle fit nicely. The sound quality is excellent, the TV channels and weather channels are received well in any kind of weather. The battery power feature came in handy during power outages. The product was well packed, easy to install, and looks beautiful as it fits into any decor."
1,Disappointing,"It seemed like this would be a great item. However, the information that this player only works with a 1st generation iPod Shuffle is nowhere to be found on Amazon. We only figured that out after installing it and looking for information on the iHome website after we couldn't get it to recognize our 3rd generation Shuffle. Oh, well."
3,Under Counter i-pod Player,The unit would get top reviews from me except Apple changed the way i-pods charge software wise and this unit will not charge any i-pod past 2nd generation. Sounddesign stopped making the Under-Counter i-pod player 3 years ago. I am leaving the unit installed but it would have been good to know these facts before purchasing. Maybe this will help someone else make a better buy.
1,DON'T EXPECT IT TO LAST,Mine lasted all of 30 months. Was repaired in the first 12 months under the warranty and then died again after 30 months. Quote $212 for repairs - obscene. A quality product should last a lot longer. STAY AWAY FROM TISSOT T TOUCH
4,Tissot Men's T-Touch Watch,Watch meets my expectations except for the Altimeter. We live in Florida at 30 feet of elevation. Watch fluctuates between -200 feet to +200 feet. Maybe it will work better at higher altitudes. Watch is well made and attractive. Delivery was as expected when ordered.
4,Word filled families,I recommend this book to families who love the word of God and want to grow together in Christ. Eph. 5:25-27; 6:4
3,good book on memory,"This is the first book I've every read on improving memory. It isn't a bad book, all of the memory techniques work and are a complete set (remember faces, numbers, facts, lists etc..) and the book is well written.The biggest reason that I give it a 3 star rating instead of a 4 or 5 is that the book is badly dated. It needs a re-write or a new edition with photos instead of bad line drawings (of people's faces for the remembering names section) and the constant references to cigarettes (I don't know why, but there is always cigarettes to remember on half of the word lists and various examples, a pet peeve for a non smoker).If you're looking for a better book, check out Kenneth Higbee's ""You Memory"" which I consider THE book on memory and memory techniques. You can also check Lorayne's newer books. ""The Memory Book"" by Lorayne and Lucas is much better and much newer, although it contains almost identical information."
2,Barely a shoestring's worth of advice.,"Based on previous reviews, I ordered this book, but was disappointed. Maybe it's because I've read others that are far better: The Visual Handbook to Building and Remodeling, by Charles Wing, and Building An Affordable Home, by Ruiz. Both these books contain far more specific info. Building on a Shoestring includes such priceless advice as: ""comparison shop."" ""The more bells and whistles you opt for, the more you'll pay."" Even when info. is good, it's too vague, like ""limit the amount of plumbing pipe you have to lay."" How? Some of the info. is NOT cost-cutting, but actually increases costs: Install a shut-off valve at EVERY plumbing fixture; Build 16 inches on center rather than 24. This book goes in the Goodwill box."
2,Too Generic,"I was expecting much more from this resource than it delivered. The activities were far too generalized (cause and effect charts, basic vocabulary graphics) to be useful in my 11th grade AmLit class. Much better suited to younger students."
4,sweetness made easy through amazon,"Have trouble finding this product in the stores and it is the best sweetener that I have found. It is just the right size to sweeten my cup of coffee. I was also very pleased at how fast I got it, before the promised time."
4,Necta Sweet Tab.,The product is what I wanted and expected but 3000 tabs is a bit too much. It would be nice to have the option to order just one bottle. These three bottles will be around to go into my estate.
5,"Christmas Plates from Royal Delft, ""De Porceleyne fles""","This ""book"" is a 7"" by 10"" loose leave binder with 150 pages (my copy}. The subjects cover the artists, history of blue and white ware, trade mark and other facts, how plates are made, hallmark of of original Royal Delft and a complete list of plates from 1915 to 1973. There must be other copies out there since I bought my binder with the sheets up to 1973 when I purchased a 1972 10"" plate. Plates were produced by ""De Porceleyne fles"" through 1986.This ""book"" is Copyright by the author, Violette Steinke, who was a homemaker in Birmingham, Alabama in 1972 at he time of publication. The publisher/printer was Gray Printing Company also in Birmingham. Date of publication, October, 1972. Have not been able to find the author or family members or the publisher.Any help in this regard would be appreciated."
1,delayed shipping,"This product took more than 30 days to be delivered to me. Shame on whomever is responsible for this. I should have read better, however...I did not realize it was only one track song. Shame on me. Not happy, however."
5,So far so good!,Reprise has been a fantastic tool so far - it's really helped me drill and kill all the grammatical hodgepodge of French. The lessons are very well written and put together and the exercises are perfectly suited to someone trying to keep on top of all the idisyncrasies of the French language.
4,Reprise Workbook,Great review for fourth year grammar--needed a few extra textbooks and found them for a fraction of the cost here...
1,broke,"I was very happy with this product until it inexplicably stopped working 3 months after the 90 day warranty ran out. It will still beep to wake me up like a conventional (read-irritating) alarm clock, but it no longer plays music from, or charges my ipod. Im really disappointed that the warranty is so short since Id sure like to get my money back."
3,Black insert for iPod Nano 4g does not fit,"My plastic insert for the iPod Nano 4g fits on the base but not with the Nano 4g. Someone miscalculated the measurements although I do have the Red Nano...maybe that's the difference. Next, there's a small dent in the right speaker. I'll keep it anyway so I can bring it with me when I travel."
5,Great ihome really 4 1/2 stars (minus half for remote),I got this for christmas and it works great. We had it setup in about 2 minutes and as soon as I put the batteries in it worked. I can go to sleep with it on and wake up to it also. Its cute and small so I can move it easily and bring it to another room. Only problem is my remote won't work but I still have the warrenty and now I'll have the joy of learning their customer service! YAY!!!!! Overall though this is a great product and worth buying.
2,You get what you pay for.,"This little gem started to fall apart on me almost exactly as the factory warranty expired. I purchased it thinking I would get a nice little docking station for my bedside table, and save money compared to buying the full-sized model (iHome IH8BR Clock Radio for iPod). My mistake. This unit often causes my iPod to freeze up, one of the speakers has stopped working, and I never know if the alarm will actually play from my iPod or just beep. I have never traveled with it, but I can't imagine it would stand up to much handling. If you're looking for a quality dock for your iPod, keep looking for one that's actually worth its price tag."
4,I enjoy mine,"I bought an iHome2go at a fund raising auction. I enjoy it enough that I am buying my daughter one. I sell real estate and use it when I hold an 'Open House'. It is compact, has a travel case, sounds great and you don't have to plug it in to use it. I have used it three days on the current batteries. I would recommend this to anyone looking for compact unit with good sound."
1,Sound is terrible,"I do not have batteries installed just yet, but so far the sound out of this little thing is terrible. It is extremely distorted and I have tried to adjust the settings on the iPod to help it out, but so far no good."
4,iHome travel alarm clock,Love it! We loved the first one so much that we bought another for our son.
3,Glad I bought it.,"I wanted a travel alarm that would dock with my iPod. That is what I got. Everything works as it claims. Although everything is functioning, I get the feeling that this device probably won't last. The construction seems a bit suspect. For a hundred bucks I hoped for a bit of quality construction.That being said, I am still glad I bought it."
1,don't buy it,There is only one main reason I do not like this product. The receiver for the remote control for the ihome290 also picks up signals from my tv remote control. So my ihome will turn on randomly when I'm changing television channels.
5,Great! Works just as advertised.,"I'm a college student, and I bought this in order to play music in my dorm. Unlike many other reviews, the iHome can be as quiet as you want, but can also be very loud. It works great as an alarm clock, the sleep function is excellent, and the sound quality is great. One con is that the backlit lcd face generates a lot of light at night... it's similar to a night light."
2,Too loud,"As the other reviewer said, the lowest volume setting is far, far too loud, making this a poor choice for an office desk or a home nightstand. (I can't even begin to enjoy the ""sleep"" function.) Also, for a travel unit, the carrying bag provided is not big enough to hold the base unit, the iPod and the charger. All in all, a nice design and look, but these two flaws (especially the volume issue) put this unit directly into the return pile."
1,Waste of time and money,I got the dock late and when it came it worked for about a week. Then one day it stopped and one of my friends had to stick something behind the ipod and the piece that holds that ipod up in order for it to play.
2,incomplete features information,"I bought this for my granddaughter for christmas for her Ipod Touch. It said nothing about not being able to be used with the model Ipod she has. If there are restrictions for what Ipod Touch models could be used with it, then it should say that in the description and information. We had to get inside the box and read the instructions before we found it wouldn't work with her model. I could send it back with hassle, so I decided to keep it and use it for my alarm clock. I am not at all happy with the way they mislead the buyer with their description."
2,do not buy from electronics expo!,"""1ST OF ALL THE SOUND IS VERY LOW! ON THE FIRST DAY, THE CLOCKS BATTERY WERE VERY LOW, AND WHEN I CALLED EXPO TO TELL THEM MY ISSUE, THEY WERE VERY CARELESS AND DID NOT OFFER A SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM! THEY GAVE ME A HASSEL, I WILL NEVER BUY THIS ITEM NOR FROM EXPO AGAIN! WORST SERVICE EVER!"""
2,Product was broken,"I know this is a good product becuase I purchased one before and my son loved it. However, this one arrived broken and I have not been able to get a hold of the supplier to return it. After two weeks of trying, I've resolved to just buying another one."
3,"Good Alarm Clock and Speakers, but Too Large for Travel","This was a gift for my husband. He doesn't use it for traveling (it's a little too large for that), but does take it outside when we need small speakers for our ipod. The down side to this is the alarm, which is extremely loud and annoying (particularly if you don't have to get up but your husband does). I have the full-size iHome, which has more options for the alarm. In short, get the full-size iHome if you don't need to travel."
4,Great for travel!,"Remember when purchasing this item that you are buying a small set of speakers to play your music. Though the speakers do have a pretty impressive sound, they are at the mercy of the volume of the songs on your iPod. So, some of the songs are not very loud on the highest volume.Overall, the size of the system and sound are great for travel and I have taken it with me on two trips. Easy setup and take down. I wish there was a way to control my iPod through buttons on the system, as pushing the wheel and such on my iPod when it is in the cradle is awkward.Definitely worth the purchase if you want an alarm clock and music center for you iPod."
3,Not happy with volume settings,"I bought this for my desk at work, unfortunately I will be returning the item - the lowest volume setting is much too loud. Otherwise, I liked it."
3,It's a portable clock radio...,"The sound is ok, it's about what you would expect from tiny speakers, but still better than my old clock radio. The biggest advantage is obviously that it plays my music, instead of listening to mindless am radio.The downside is that it's a little difficult to set it to play the correct playlist in the morning. It's like you have to play it at night, then stop it in mid-play so will resume for your morning alarm. I've also had it play random selections for my alarm. All-in-all, a good investment, no major complaints."
3,"Good content, okay images","There is a lot of great information in this book but I was really disappointed when it came to the images. Many of the really important posters are in black and white, such as lissitzky's ""beat the whites..."", in which color is very important."
4,Quite good text and illustrations but mostly black and white,"The selection, history and illustrations are excellent: broad-reaching, pithy, clear and sharp. Just be prepared for one important dimension to be thin: Only about a fourth of the images are in color."
4,Well written,A great book for a student. A wee bit more information than I was hoping for though for home learning.
3,I'm not a vitamin taker. I thought I'd ...,"I'm not a vitamin taker. I thought I'd Test Drive this product to see if it would help me feel more invigorated. It didn't. I enjoyed the fact that each day's supplies of vitamins was packaged in a sealed packet. However, I didn't like the fact that there were six different pills to take. If you don't normally eat a well-balanced diet, then this product would make up the difference. I just didn't enjoy taking so many pills. I also didn't feel any difference, as the product claimed!"
3,Vera Lynn: We'll Meet Again,Vera Lynn is an outstanding sing but the sound quality of this CD is very poor and mars her performance.
2,Not in the same league as Hitchcock,"This weak and contrived film is a very pale imitation of Hitchcock. It actually begins in a very promising way-Terry Lambert (Steve Guttenberg) is having an affair with his boss's wife (Isabelle Huppert). She witnesses an attack on a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) outside Terry's bedroom window, but he agrees to report it to the police as if he saw it so that their relationship will remain secret. His story (and the film's) begins to fall apart until eventually he is on the run for crimes he didn't commit.With ""L.A. Confidential,"" writer/director Curtis Hanson would later show that he is capable of crafting top-flight film fare, but he just doesn't make it here. The script is too far-fetched and the character's actions become increasingly implausible until the over-wrought, unconvincing conclusion. The decidedly low wattage of stars Guttenberg and McGovern doesn't help either."
4,Fabolous!!,"The Bedroom Window is one of my favorite movies of all time. I was so surprised to finally find this movie, which I had been searching for along time to find. I encourage anyone to shop on amazon.com if you can't find something particular. ""Amazon Has It All"" Thanks!!!"
5,Very happy with their service!,The movie came on time and in good shape. They lived up to what they said. I was happy
4,Hitchcockian thriller,"A married woman (Isabelle Huppert), while at the apartment of the man she's having an affair with, witnesses an attempted murder outside the window. Leery about going to the cops, the boyfriend (Steve Guttenberg) does it for her. Thus begins all kinds of twists and turns and complications in this taut and entertaining thriller. Some of them are pretty implausable, but before you have time to sort one out the movie snowballs into the next one. Huppert double crosses Guttenberg, of course, to protect herself, and Guttenberg eventually gets help from another woman (Elizabeth McGovern), whom he ends up with at movie's end. There are lots of Hitchcockian touches: the premise itself from ""Rear Window"" and a stabbing scene at the ballet from ""North by Northwest."" Not a bad movie at all."
4,Wonderful performers!,"The only reason I gave this four stars is because I've heard them perform live and there is simply no comparison. They are magnetic. I have never heard better harp playing than Wiggins' playing live. He seems muted on the album. This is my first purchase of their music, but there will be more."
5,Interesting Case -- Unusual Writing Style,"In one night I read this book cover to cover. The case itself was interesting with a nice insight provided by the author into the mind and planned actions of the two evil female killers. What really kept me reading was how the author let me know, from the beginning of the book, the eventual outcome of the trial and the circumstances surrounding the death of one of the offenders and the sentencing of the other. In most true crime books I have read the author drags you through the crime details, the manhunt for the killer(s), capture and then the ultimate criminal sentence. The writing style of this book is different and it sets it apart from many other formula true crime books. A very good read!"
2,Not in the league of other True Crime accounts,"As a real fan of true crime mysteries, I expected this account to have the flair and appeal of 'Helter Skelter' but was sorely disppointed. The book states the facts with little style and while I finished the book--wanting to see what happens to the two murderesses, its abrupt ending, lack of personality, and zero allowance for readers seeking to identify with the victim, caused me to be acutely disappointed. Don't waste your money."
3,IT WAS JUST O.K.,"FOR SOME REASON, THIS BOOK, THE MORE I READ THE WORSE IT GOT. IN A WAY, I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE FINISHING IT. I'M ALMOST AT THE END AND IT JUST SEEMS TO KEEP SAYING THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER."
2,Publisher should be embarrassed,The copy on the pages of this book looks like a 5th generation copy from a Mimeograph machine.There is no excuse for charging $65 for photocopies.I should probably be glad that this was not on a Kindle. I don't think I can imagine how useless it would be then!
1,Really poor version,"This has been the worst, yet most expensive, text book I have purchased so far in Grad School. It is blurry, the fonts larger than size 12 bleed together. It looks like a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy. I am surprised a publisher would sell this edition."
5,"Enjoyable, well illustrated story.",I find this book useful in teaching teachers about the folk lore of Africa. It also is useful in showing teachers an interesting way to introduce and discuss values with young children.
4,Participatory,"Prayer-leaders and teachers, this book has a refrain that young children quickly learn to fill in with/for you. They enjoy the personification of the penny, especially in the illustrations (""it has legs like a boy!""). Valuable addition to your library. P.S. You can get it direct from the publisher for $10 by calling 1-877-4-MERKOS, so don't spend $40 on the resellers that link to Amazon."
1,"Cheap, but worthless",Most of the pages I need for my homework are missing. This book is completely useless to me. Thanks a lot.
5,Presidential Analysis,"THis thoughtful and very insightful work spans an investigation of the presidencies from Eisenhower to Johnson passing via Kennedy. Thoughtful and descriptive, this is a profound analysis of the Presidents and their administrations which shaped the events of this important period in history. Highly recommended"
4,Complete and compelling,"Sundquist clearly and engagingly traces the development of many programs in what would become Johnson's Great Society as they developed over three presidential administrations. Education reform, poverty, the environment, social services and more are shown rising from America's post-war boom but taking years, and often much effort, to come into being.This history is more complete than even many individual accounts of given programs as it examines presidential influence, public opinion, changes in Congress, the rise and fall of interest groups, and how each can lead or be led by the others. Most importantly, it does so without becoming too technical or dry - Sundquist is a gifted historian, very readable even on such complex topics.A must-have for political historians and those interested in policy-making. Casual followers of the presidents involved, or American history buffs in general, should also find much to enjoy."
3,a competent book of poetry,"I fully expected to love this book - rural setting, conciseness influenced by far Eastern poetry, political and religious awareness. All the poems are well written - but neither images, word usage or emotion stick in the reader's memory. Yes, there are a few exceptions: ""You (the earth)were hungry / like us / for seed"" in ""the earth"" or from ""the old teacher"": ""that's how he wanted to help us / construct the world: / solid everyday life/ and occasional expeditions / inward to the borders of mystery."" But there are few enough exceptions for me to recommend this book only to those with a specific interest in Scandanavian or Norwegian poetry."
3,ALL IS NOT AS IT APPEARS,"I hate to be the person who cannot report glowing remarks about this book, however, I need to tell you I am not a frequent reader of fiction. For me this book speaks in allegories and that is not my favorite kind of reading where I have to try to figure out what the author is saying.The story held my interest through 3/4ths of the book and I was wondering how it was going to end. It was filled with interesting information about the makeup of rocks and was quite realistic in the beginning about the fears created during war, but in the end I was left hanging due to the fairy tale ending. I have not had good luck reading translated books either, as their outlook of life is so different (strange"") than mine. With three 5's and a ""4"" rating I thought I was going to read a story I liked; sorry it wasn't to be."
1,Why?,"I am always looking for new Japanese writers translated into English and was excited to see this book. But after having read it, I couldn't figure out why? Why was this book translated? There are so many amazing Japanese writers, why does another bizarre Japanese writer have to be translated. It makes me wonder what people think of Japanese writers when they read these kinds of books. For me he is in the same bizarre and waste of space category as Murakami."
5,Budget Surprise,"While the lighter 22nd and triumphal 25th piano concertos appear to be recorded less frequently, Mr. Brendel and the Vienna State Opera Orchestra produce a very enjoyable program with surprisingly good sound for a very reasonable price."
4,Well it is a book,While I dont like to give bad reviews. It is bearly worth the price or the effort to to filp the pages.
3,Crazy Editing,"Coulter doesn't consider himself a photographer, although he definitely has a gift. His images are highly erotic while not overtly glamorous. As a matter of fact, this could have been titled ""White Trash Diva"" except not all of his models are strictly caucasian. It's essense is, however, raw in an explicit way that is nevertheless enticing. The book is divided by model and some photos are stunning while others should have been on the cutting room floor. But, I was not disappointed and the price was appropriate. Overall a good addition to my collection."
3,Nice...ish,"This book is a lot smaller than I anticipated, there are some beautiful pictures that are inspiring and artistic and incredibly sexy.not really what i was afterok but not on the top of my favourites list"
1,"Looks perfect, doesn't work that way...","Nice looking watch, but had problems from the beginning with my wrist turning black (wouldn't expect from a $1500 watch). After a year and a half the battery went dead, or so I thought. $475 later the internals were rebuilt and 1 year 7 months later the pins started falling out of the band. Tag customer service was far less than helpful, way less than friendly even. They started making excuses - ""Do you wear the watch in the shower? Because the steam will damage it and void the warranty."" etc, etc.The watch sits in my drawer, can't find any one who can get new pins for the band and last time I sent it out (well, see above)... Makes a nice paperweight, but in the meantime my backup pulsar is still working after 5 years, on the same battery!"
5,Great DS9 and Great Writing,"""Twilight"" continues the Deep Space Nine story, picking up where ""Demons of Air and Darkness"" and ""What Lay Beyond"" left off. It is the first of a four-book series that tells the story of a three month exploration by Defiant of the Gamma Quadrant. At the same time, political and personal stories continue back on the station.The writer handles both plotlines expertly, weaving back and forth between the different settings while always leaving the reader wanting more. His writing is rich in detail and provides great depth to the characters. The voices of all the characters are perfect, and we learn more about almost all of them as they move through the circumstances of the story. There is pretty much something for every character here, but especially for Vaughn, Prynn, Kira, Ro, Quark, and Dax.All in all, a terrific book, filled with drama, humor, and a few surprises. I am looking forward to the rest of this series."
3,A solid kickoff,"A solid kickoff for the Mission: Gamma series. I'd echo other readers' comments about occasional slow pacing (particularly in Vaughn's adventures) and the implausibility of the Ro/Quark relationship, and this book seems to be missing some of the welcome, balancing levity found in the second book of the series. Extra points, however, for degree of difficulty--surely having to get the ball rolling requires the first author to do some of the heavy introductory lifting--and for creating a wonderful new alien race. This decidedly non-humanoid race is a welcome addition to the Star Trek universe."
2,So-so,"This is a pretty typical volume in the Trek library. It tends to fall into a lot of the standard cliches and there's nothing very deep or subtle to find in David R. George's writing. The Ro/Quark plot is absolutely ridiculous and almost impossible to stomach. In fact, the entire characterization of Ro is way too girly and quite out of character for her."
5,A Parent's dream come true,"This was an excellent book for me, the parent, AND for my child. We referred to this book many times throughout the 4th, 5th and 6th grades. I only wish they had one for high school!"
5,Real Rock & Roll with Southern sounds and soulful harmonies.,"True Rock & Roll. Some compare them to the Black Crowes, some early Aerosmith, and others the Rolling Stones. In a fictional world, the Cadillac Voodoo Choir would be explained by taking the strong points of these bands, throwing them together and Sly Stone coming back to let them know how to make their Southern Rock & Roll mix with funk and soul. Since we know that didn't happen, although it would explain a lot, we can only imagine that these guys from Atlanta, GA and Austin, TX came together and created such a great record through their own genius. There is not one let down through the entire CD. From start to finish you'll be mesmerized by their arrangements and harmonies. The complexity of which is unparalleled in today's music. Sensational song writing, powerful arrangements, all with an unbelievable delivery. Buy this CD."
4,A tender and respectful tribute,"Okay, so he's not the firebreather he was during the 60's, but certainly no one can bring more to the table than Pharoah Sanders when it comes to doing a Coltrane tribute album. Even if the album contains chestnuts like ""Misty"", the ripeness and authority of Sanders' playing transcends criticism, and with the three other players succesfully invokes the sound of the (Garrison,Tyner, Jones) classic quartet without being imitative. Much recommended, a tender and respectful tribute to a man and an era."
5,A Hard-To-Find Classic By A Much Underappreciated Writer,"Like ""Guys And Dolls,"" the Treasury is a collection of Runyon's Broadway short stories. It includes favorites like ""Hold 'Em Yale"" and ""Jack 'O Hearts,"" as well as some more rare tales including an early Runyon piece where a prototype of Runyon's typically uninvolved narrator actually plays a crucial role in the storyline. The stories within and the excellent introduction (which sheds much more light on the author's life than any other Runyon collection) make this both a perfect introduction to Runyon's Broadway or an excellent addition to a collection. Damon Runyon is often forgetten when the time comes to list the great American writers of the 20th century. His unique style of prose is truly entertaining, and he evokes any emotion from the reader at will (""Little Miss Marker"", for example will force you through the whole spectrum of emotion). A great collection of works from one of my favorite writers."
3,Tiny make-up for tiny bags...,"This tiny all-in-one makeup kit is very cute indeed. The colors go on well and it really does have everything. I experienced a few issues with the kit so far, however. The kit itself does not click shut. So, it could open in my bag at any time. To solver this I ended up keeping it packed my it's ""Take Out Box"" outer covering, but this makes the whole thing larger, which kinda defeats the purpose. Also, the eye liner broke almost immediately and I cannot find anything to sharpen it."
4,Fun!,This make up kit is a lot of fun but I do have trouble with the eyeliner being too hard. It is so stiff and painful I never use it. The rest of the kit is great!
4,Not your typical MH or MJ,"The sophomore release from Marques Houston is one for the R&B books. Definitely the best R&B album from a male for the year 2005 (for now), it has it's twist and turns. The album starts out with the hit ""All Becuase of You"" (not to be confused with ""Because of You"", released of the MH album.) From here, the album takes a rather ""R&B'd"" turn. With songs like ""Sex With You"" and ""Marriage"", both lyrically unstable, but vocally efficient, you feel alot more sexy with Naked than MH. The song ""Naked"" is obviously THE best song off the album. I also took note of ""I Wasn't Ready"" and ""Cheat"". But to the real point.... MH SOUNDS REALLY CLOSE TO MJ. That's right the king of pop Michael Jackson. Listen to songs like ""Something Else"" and tell me you can't hear MJ in it- I bet you can't. Either way, this album is a good sophomore effort from good ol' MH!"
3,naked,naked was like the best one on the cd but it was ok what motivated me to get it in the first place was when he got a@# naked on stage at the scream 2005 tour i felt like i had to support the man after that wonderful experience. but the album was just ok
4,I like it,"Marques's Naked cd is good , its alot better than the MH album , it shows how much he's matured since the last album . my favorite song is Sex With you , Marriage and Cheat ! I love those 3 songs those are the only songs I really listen to !"
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I bought the album after hearing a few songs on another online music service provider i subscribe to. Probably one of the most under rated new albums of the year. Although I've always considered him talented, I didn't really consider myself a fan of his music because I'm a bit older and Immature was after my time. I'm definitely a Marques Houston fan now. I hope people read these reviews and I hear more of his other tracks on the radio. Overall just a night mixer of everything Hip-hop and R&B. One of those albums that you can push play and not have to skip over songs because you like them all. I have to admit ""I Wasn't Ready"" is my favorite track. Just ask my husband who had to hear it over and over again on a recent road trip."
4,Amazing Second Album,"I would just like to say that this album is hot. After reading some of the reviews I thought it wasnt going to be good but that wasnt true. I already love All Because of You but when I listened to the rest of the album I thought this was a more complete album than MH. He has the ballads for us ladies and then he has some all out dance tracks like 12 oclock and Something Else which gets you dancing in your seat. And even though its not good to cheat on anyone, he made the concept work for the song. Overall I loved the album you just have to listen to it twice to like the whole album but at first listen,All Because of You,Sex With You,Naked,Something Else,and Cheat were standout tracks to me.Great sophomore album for MH!!! I recommend it to anyone who loves the R&B;/hip-hop genre!"
2,Fairly Good,"Overall it is a fairly good album. Marques Houston has grown into a fine young man. I am just as old as Marques Houston so I can remember his Immature days. In my opinion, there are very few songs that are worth being listened to over and over and some that are not. The tracks that I like are as follows:1-All because of You2-Sex Wit You3-Marriage5-Naked6-Do You Mind11-Everything"
3,"Ok, but could've been better.","I love the cd, but it's so short. It's 11 songs, totaling about 45 minutes. Out of the 11 songs, I like about 8 or 9 of them. The upbeat songs are mainly the ones that suck. His upbeat songs are better on his last cd, MH, but the slow songs are better on this one."
4,Looks like MH is immature no more,This cd is hot from beginning to end. He has a lot of talent and anyone who owns the Omarion cd will notice that MH wrote a couple of the songs. What joints rule on this cd are the uptempo ones.
1,A Bit Of A Yawner.......,"What was I thinking???? LOL This CD is TOO slow and TOO bland! It just sounds like one continuous song. You wait for a break from all the slow, sex oriented songs for a club banger...and NOTHING! Well, actually you get 1 and that is with ""12 O' Clock"" Featuring Joe Budden (probably the best song on the whole CD). Don't get me wrong, I like slow jams if they have substance and meaning to them. These do not. It is sex this, sex that. Just too repetitive. There is a few ""ok"" songs...but nothing that stands out and nothing you want to hit repeat on. Just a very bland effort all the way around. I would suggest either just saving your money or sampeling it before you purchase it."
2,Too much sex!!,Seriously thats all he sings about. SEX. Marques needs to chill out with his winny. He's the biggest horn dog ever. Thank You
2,All this CD talks about is sex!,"I am NOT A Kid! I am a teenager.Anyway, I love Marques Houston, but this CD is evil. I am so tired of hearing sex related songs. Naked, Sex wit you, and Do you mind, I think the lyrics are disgusting. Naked was okay, but I think the music industry should limit their artist to one sex song per CD. Let's see how they would do then!I gave this CD 2 stars because i loved ""All Because Of You"""
1,I've DONE IT AGAIN!!!,"I looked at the reviews before I got the cd and from the reviews i was not supposed to be dissapointed. I am very dissapointed with this cd as well as that damn tweet cd that was supposed to be good. This cd is a fall off when there was nothing to fall off of. I won't lie there are a few songs that are worth giving a chance but the ones that are bad are exactly that,BAD.It is the same old thing over and over and over again! Seek help Mr.Houston! Maybe Batman and LDB or whatever his name is can rescue you by joining back with you and then ,maybe Mr. houston,you won't suck alone!SAVE YOUR MONEY LEAVE THIS CD IN THE STORE!!!!!"
2,and im juss feelin srry 4 him,"this cd is not all that....srry 2 all my girls but 2 tell u the truth he needs 2 sit down!!!!! ""do u mind""....yes i do that song is borin 2 me!!if i were 2 like 1 song on there it wud b ""all because of u"" i cant lie 2 u i dnt like that song either i wasted money on this cd!!!!...haha thats y i sold it 4 $13.00 no offense but its not worth it chris brown on the other hand....thats a cd u wanna buy haha bAy ArEa stand up!!!"
2,VOCALS SUCKS,Man when i first got the cd I was excited. But that all came to an END when I heard it. His vocals were not much improved. Still trying to be everyone else besides himself. Suck SUck Suck get a better vocal trainer
3,I hate to say this but..........,The album is okay. I agree with the one comment that someone said that all of his upbeat songs sound the same. I love batman (Marques Houston) but sheeesh leave it alone. I also agree that most of the songs sound nasty and dirty. Overall I guess the cd is preety cool. I'm about to listen to my favorite track right now: Something Else!!!!
4,i love it,"i love this cd, but dont like all the cussing. i couldnt find the clean version, but the cd is great. go get it."
3,Pretty good..,"I was never really a fan of Marques Houston till I had my best friend singing ""All Because Of You"" constantly! I decided to buy the cd and I guess I can say it was worth the money. My favorite tracks are:#1- All Because Of You#2- Sex Wit You#3- Marriage#5- Naked#6- Do You Mind#11- EverythinI usually skip over #'s 4,7,8,9, and 10It is a really good cd though...I can't complain. =)"
4,Job Well Done,"Coming from immature to IMX to MH and now Naked, it shows how much he has grown in the industry. I consider myself as a true R&B conorsoiur and I know good music when I hear it. This album has most of the elements that create a great album. Smooth grooves, catchy lyrics and his voice doesn't hurt either. I am proud to make this album the latest addition to my 500+ collection of R&B greats. This album will be the biggest thing till...........TP.3 Reloaded by R. Kelly...."
2,No great,"I was recently introduced to Bukowski over the summer. I read 2 of his books Ham on Rye and Post office. I really enjoyed them. I had great appreciation for the writing style and the stories. However, this book threw me a little. It just seemed to drag and the same things kept happening; old ugly man meets really hot young girl. They screw, fight and break up. The first couple of times were interesting then it just got tired. You really didn't need 200+ pages for that sort of plot to keep happening. I have to say there was really nothing to take from this book except an old dirty alcoholic womanizer. The shock factor was gone after the first 100 pages. So I say give it a read if you want but I wouldn't say it was anything to compare to the first 2 books I have read from Bukowski."
4,Low-Brow Brilliance,"From the beginning, ""Women"" is an entertaining and vulgar read. At times it feels like written porn, and as I approached the end of the novel I was a bit tired of Chinaski's (read: Bukowski) endless sexcapades; they become rather redundant. Still, it seems Bukowski never lies to the reader, and this brutal honesty is both shocking and appreciated. Like Hemingway, he doesn't waste time on descriptions and adjectives. Yet, Bukowski manages to paint a vivid picture, enough that the reader can nearly smell the stale alcohol on Chinaski's breath after a night of excess. The deadbeats come to life in ""Women,"" and their many faults and scars seem all too real, maybe even familiar. Any man should read this, if only to know that in his darkest moments he is still a better man than Henry Chinaski."
4,Good,the book held my attention. it had some really funny and kind of sad parts too. he writes like i would guess he speaks. the c word was used a lot - hope you're not offended easily.
4,Bukowski as Lebowski,This book is one I stumbled across and I am so glad I did. I find myself laughing out loud at times at the situations he finds himself in and his reactions to same.His writing is beautiful in it's simplicity and conveys a full spectrum of emotion. His character is so unlovable that you end up loving him... I recommend this book to anyone ready to explore the wild side....
5,Take this to the john instead of the Sunday paper...,This is one of those guilty pleasure books that you don't want your girlfriend or wife to even browse. I have never read anything quite like this that describes the psyche and the secret lust within every man with such economy of words. The author did an incredible job of revealing his subtle musings and emotions from underneath the vulgar and the sordid (and there's so much in the book). Kudos to Bukowski for honestly speaking the mind of the male sex. PS. Jack Nicholson would the perfect candidate to play Henry Chinaski in a possible film version of this novel.
4,Pretty damn funny!,"My first Bukowski reading. Quite hilarious, although, you need to have a stomach for it, a good sense of humor, and be open minded. Did he repect or care about anything or anyone? I'm not sure he did, but that is what makes it so funny. Not recommended for the easily offended or today's politically correct. Why couldn't we have read this material in school? I probably would've finished at least one book in English if it were Bukowski's."
4,the freaky,"Don't you just hate it when you're making love, or just plain ole doin' the freaky, and some wack song comes on the radio? Bukowski does. And he shakes his funky leg in this tome. Quite a bit. It's a good read, bit too long perhaps, some sloppy writing on occaision. But what's important is that he puts some blood down. Some of the death terror. Which is good for everyone. And I dig, on."
2,unfunny,"bukowski deludes himself when he prefaces his works by commenting, ""these are my funny stories"" becausereaders will determine the value of any humor in the work. bukowski uses words such as ""pussyhairs"" to stir up our mirth. hamostly this novel rubs lots of ""friends"" and ""lovers"" noses in some real disgusting and badly written garbage and fetid waste products of the writer.it's not a good book, even if it's his best selling novel. neither is it in the least humorous unless the reader communicates in oinks."
4,Prose is direct like pavement,"This was actually my first Bukowski book I ever read. I had a girlfriend who had started getting into him right after he died... She liked him because he was so bitter. She later broke up with me using a lot of the same reasoning she had for likeing Bukowski! Nevermind that, though...Buk only wrote about ten or so different stories in most people's minds. What I find most facinating is that he rarely gets boring (there's some horse track stories that I could never finish). The synopsis of ""Women"" may make the book sound monotonous, but Bukowski's talent is delivering his life in a direct and interesting way."
2,Boring.,"Bukowski is an inspiration to a good portion of male writer-wanna-bees of this generation. He's impressive in poetry and I give his poetry 5 stars and then some, but this book was bland and shockingly so. I kept hoping to see some sort of climax, but ended up forgetting which woman was which. The book starts and ends the same way, depressing. In the end, you don't understand him any better than you did in the first page."
1,Absolutely ridiculous.,This is a meaningless piece of fluff BUT it's not even entertaining! Is this Bukowski's secret fantasy: to have hoardes of beautiful women chase after him for sex? Dream on. Poorly written (for anyone above 12 years of age).
3,"Fun to read, but not his best.","Everything by Bukowski is a lot of fun to read, but this one really doesn't go anywhere. Post Office and his short stories are much better. Don't let your girlfriend (or even worse, her mother) flip through this thing while it's on your coffee table, you'll be sorry!"
5,A splendid and vigorous American novel,"No writer puts it down like Bukowski, all heart and scars, jabs and whimpers. Like Hemingway, he does not mince words -- his verbiage is that of the L.A. streets. ""Women"" offers a scathing peek at the battle of the sexes, or rather, Buk's battles with the ornery fems who threaten his sanity, and sometimes, his life. For those who know Buk's writing, no review is ever needed. His prose is addicting, funny, and satisfying like a charred rare T-bone steak. But to those who don't know the Buk -- KNOW HIM!"
2,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"Don't believe the hype. Some people love Bukowski. I'm not one of them. Of all the alcoholic, misogynistic writers of the 20th century...Bukowski's one of them. His editor did him a horible disservice by not lopping off about 100 pages from this interminable tome. The only thing worse than reading his repetitive one paragraph descriptions of sex (which often go unconsummated) is imagining the disappointment his lovers must have endured at his hands. There are no artful passages, no insightful metaphors, no beautiful turns of phrase. I will grant him this one compliment: he does not bore. But then again, I could read stories about sex forever. Even bad ones."
3,Repetitive,"""Women"" is one scene going around and around. Henry does a reading, meets a babe, gets drunk, beds the babe, gets drunk,gets a letter from a babe, meets the babe, beds the babe, gets drunk, does another reading....etc.....Most of the women in this book are sleazy.I liked ""Ham on Rye"" and ""Postoffice"" much better."
3,Hilarious,"This is one of Bukowski's more accomplished novels; it is more layered and truly felt than 'Post-Office,' yet at the same time is does not achieve the ugly splendor of his poetry.In this little book, Henry Chinaski is chasing women of all things, that is, while he's not chasing booze and notoriety. Having achieved a small amount of fame, he is now able to woo the ladies on command, and the result is extremely sexually graphic and candid.Many will find Buck's ramblings a tad repetitive (I did at least), though one cannot help feeling that these experiences are real. 'Women' is both funny and tragic; Buck is America's answer to the French Existentialists, albeit without the abstruse meanderings. This novel is a fine accomplishment, though not a classic."
3,Very good,"300 pages of hard drinking, cheap sex and foul language. Is this art? Yes, maybe the best damn kind, for a man like Henry Chinaski has a lot of time on his hands to drink, think, write and dream. In a post-modern miracle of circumstances and luck, Chinaski manages to worry only about his hungers. The rest is irrelevant. From this blank slate springs a philosophy, a story, of a singular man - selfish, mean, loving and brilliant. A shining example of the memoir novel."
1,Bukowski ... Ugh.,"Bukowski was a degenerate pig who fancied himself an artist. His ""art"" was the slimy fantasies of an alcoholic with rage issues. I met a hundred Bukowskis when I used to tend bar. Who cares?"
1,Boring...and not funny...,"It is my first and last Bukowski...Never heard of the guy till this one. Sorry, but have never been exposed to his poetry - which I understand (but now I seriously doubt) it is exquisite.Expected to have an exhilarating insight into...well, WOMEN from someone who knows about the subject. I should have listened to the other reviewers in the 1 - 2 stars section. What a boring recollection of girls by an ugly, old, broke alcoholist - but, hey, one that is soooo full of himself and his 7inch acrobatic member. Oooops, I must have divulged a secret...I apologize if I have ruined somebody's pleasure of this soon to be forgotten writer and book."
5,Guys really can change,"I enjoyed this book for how it reminded me or my younger days...perhaps of course only in my dreams. But what REALLY struck me about this book were the insights he suddenly obtained into his relationships with women. Been there, done that.Anyway, I was secretly racing through the book for its loose attitudes toward sex and women, then toward the end of the book a true denouement started to take place. I suddenly started underlining the book like crazy. I saw what he saw. He started to question why he was hurting so many people, and why he couldn't focus. Then he changed. He gained capacity to relate. I remember thinking the same things. I was glad to see him change.This is a book I will always keep."
1,Not my kind of novel,"I read this novel for a book club. It is a little too tedious for me with all the repetition - get drunk, get a girl, get laid, get rid of girl through manic behavior, etc. After a while, it become boring. I was not offended by the sex and language, but the book is what it is. I don't think it was meant to be this grand work of literature. But the joke is on the reader if you expect anything grand for this book."
2,"Boring, predictable and repetitive","I bought Women and Factotum based on alot of good reviews here on amazon. Not sure what others see in these books but i wasn't impressed. I like reading so i read both of the books, one after the other within 4 days. I guess i'm just not interested in the same thing the majority finds amuzing."
1,Horrible Rendition,Did not like this recording. Heavy and ponderous direction of In the Steppes of Central Asia.
4,Helps designers visualize the big picture,"I migrated to the Macromedia MX platform from Cold Fusion Studio 4.5. So while the learning curve for Dreamweaver was fairly simple for me, I found the other Macromedia tools were a bit mysterious.So it was a relief to find a single book that shows how all the tools work together (Fireworks, Flash, Dreamweaver, Freehand and Cold Fusion. Impressively, this book takes you through that integration process from the perceptive of a small web development team. It is refreshing to see both the UI and functionality angles covered with equal competence in a single book.So rest assured this book is not an inventory of features, but rather a dissection of the process. Studio MX is simply a prop that the actors lean on."
2,Should have read the reviews more carefully,"I was expecting to learn more than just about how a group of web designers build websites with StudioMX. This book got high marks from the other reviewers, but in my opinion the marks were for what it teaches about ""work flow"" and team work. If thats what you are looking for then great. I ranked this book based on its worth for teaching about the software.Overall it is verbose, wasted much valuable time and not a good teaching book (not to mention typhos). If you are looking to learn more about Dreamweaver or Fireworks or Flash or Freehand, this book is not for you. Better to spend the cash on dedicated books even though you may spend more in the end (but you will likely learn more thoroughly too). For me this book has not been a good investment of time and money.This book is probably better suited for those that are working as a team with the different skill sets and interested in figuring out how Studio MX can fit in as a tool."
2,This book broke my heart,"What is more exciting than learning how to build killer websites and impress your friends and family?(nothing - that's why I bought this book)In short I strongly agree with my friend mxreader from Queensland. This book is for those who want to integrate their workflow in a corporate level webhouse. If you pick up this book knowing next to nothing about Dreamweaver, Fireworks or Flash as I did, spend too many hours reading and then skimming through hundreds of pages, you'll put it down, if you're lucky, knowing one new thing about each program.Is this an acceptable return on investment?Is this the way to learn these programs and put a website up from scratch?Is this the way to impress the three f's (friends, family and fiance)?No. No. and No.I am returning it. Thank goodness for amazon. They deserve their reputation for the best service company in existence."
4,Good-gosh-a-mighty-chile-i-said-a-right-now,"DC's own Billy Stewart was one who was doin it for Chess Records, I heard that he won a talent contest in DC @ the legendary Howard Theatre in 1955 which won him a contract. Of course his biggest two hits ""I do love you"", and ""Sittin in the Park"" was both covered by the 70's band GQ. One of my favorites ""How Nice It Iz"" is not on this Cd. Billy had a style like no other. Everytime I hear these songs, I can remember being a child in the early 60's. ( I did go see Billy @ the Howard in 1962. I recommend this cd to all R&B fans all over the world."
5,"Best, Indeed","I Do Love You and Sitting in the Park are absolutely outstanding. Simple but powerful arrangements; classic soul background vocal harmony; full, rich, warm, distortion-free stereo. These two alone are enough to put the CD at 5 stars."
5,Billy Stewart:20th Century Masters-The Millennium Collection,I am so glad I found this CD through Amazon. I had been searching for this for a long time.This is another CD I would not loan out but I will tell my friends where to find it.
5,The Best of the Billy Stewart: 20th Century Masters- The Millenium,"The sound quality is just as if you are sitting in the audience! I really enjoyed the old school feel. The CD arrived before the projected delivery date, and I would not hesitate to order from this company again."
4,I really liked this product. It smells like ...,"I really liked this product. It smells like salon conditioner, which to me is a great quality. It seemed to take some of the build-up from my other conditioner away. However, it did leave my hair with a only very few more tangles than my other conditioner. I have very long, thick, wavy hair, which makes conditioning a necessary part in my routine. It does work, and smells very good and I'd recommend it."
3,Phil Silvers and Rose Marie at the top of their form,"TOP BANANA is a cute little Broadway show from 1951, with a good score by Johnny Mercer. It features Phil Silvers and Rose Marie in the leads, with fine support from Linda Doherty, Jack Albertson, Bob Scheerer and Ted (Sport) Morgan.TOP BANANA opened at the Winter Garden Theatre in November of 1951, closing in August of 1952 due to a vacationing Phil Silvers. It reopened a few weeks later before closing in September after 350 performances.The score features a few gems including Rose Marie's infectious ""Sans Souci"", as well as ""You're So Beautiful That..."", ""I Fought Every Step of the Way"", ""Only If You're in Love"" and ""A Word a Day"", which became the show's hit song.For Broadway collectors, this album is a real gem."
3,jewish holiday cookbook,i cant say there aren;t any good recipes i was curious but it is not what i was looking for
1,Returned it to Amazon--wrong edition,Returned it to Amazon--wrong edition. Sorry ! What more can I say--needed another production recording. Why do we have eto write so much ??
1,Reference? Hardly,"This book was a major disappointment. The coverage is very light on sockets, ARP, and many other specifics. This books lives in nomans land: written for a beginner but wants to pass as a reference for experts. It accomplishes neither.Forget about this book or any other TCP/IP book and just get Steven's - TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1 : The Protocols or my second choice for advanced study and first choic for a beginner would be: Comer - Internetworking with TCP/IP Vol. I: Principles, Protocols, and Architecture.Pass on this one, I wish I had."
5,An Excellent bridge to IPv6,"This book explains IPv4 quite well while providing me with current, practical information about IPv6. It has very little fluff and gets straight to the point. I also found the detailed coverage of all the upper layer protocols and the Winsock programming interface quite helpful."
5,"""Praying God's Word: Breaking Free from Spiritual Strongholds",This is another of the GREAT books written by Beth Moore via The Holy Spirit..There is so much in it that will help break strongholds in your life using scripture. A must have if you need help of any kind...........
5,Excellent book,"This is a great book to help anyone learn how to believe the truth rather than lies we all listen to. This is so important for the world is telling us a bunch of lies and this helps get your head straight. I highly recommend it to everyone, not just women."
5,Beth Moore Daily Prayer readings,"Beth Moore. What else needs to be said about this incredible teacher! The source for her works definately comes from our Lord! Always Biblically relatable, inspirational, uplifting, and encouraging. You will ALWAYS learn from this incredible Bible teacher. She can also be seen Wednesday's on the James Robison show. You will never go wrong purchasing anything she has authored!"
1,Reinventing the wheel,"Dearest Protestant Brothers and Sisters,For centuries Christians have been praying the Word of God. In fact, it began with the Jews praying the psalms around the clock. It is called the Lectio Divina or the Divine Office. It has readings from the Bible for different hours of the day. It is meant to immerse us in God's word and move our heart into a rhythm of ""praying without ceasing.""I am a convert to Catholicism from the brand of Protestantism that Ms. Moore participates in. I appreciate her ideas, but I find that nothing quite matches the beauty of praying the Divine Office."
2,Where Was the Editor?,"This is a potentially useful book that is ruined by errors. For example, the reference sheet on page 7 gives an incorrect formula for the area of a circle and mislabels the area of a triangle."
3,It should be renamed The Bandido's,"Ya know, it was okay. Not incredibly inspiring, and at times somewhat confusing. Was this a movie about women who run fast, women who want to qualify for Boston, women who want to qualify for the olympic trials, or about the Schumacher's divorce? The commentator is talking about their divorce as they show pictures and video of apparently their wedding day. Or were they celebrating their divorce? I don't know, not clear on that part.I enjoyed the comeback story of June.THAT was very inspirational, she lives in the same city I do, and I hope to meet her someday. The whiney Karla was a bit much, but hey, we all have running friends like that. Suzy and some chic whose name I can't remember were interesting figures in the documentary if only in the fact that they, as Masters, qualified for the olympic trials.I guess I was expecting more."
3,An OK read,"I bought this book for the high reviews and price, but it was not what I was expecting. Its a good ready, but thought it was going to focus more on writing legal descriptions."
3,Excellent Entertainment,"It's true that the two sets of recordings are from much later in Tex Beneke's career, and in a few cases the vocalists are weak. But all of these military show recordings (not least the Count Basie, Peggy Lee and Les Brown, and Keely Smith CDs) are excellent entertainment.The announcer is a bit corny from time to time, but that's part of the charm of these recordings made when the goal was still to entertain and uplift."
2,only the brand...,"they're not the usual good adidas product, they're a ""whatever"" socks with the adidas brand printed on them, better buy another type with these money. In Marshall I got the wonderful clima-cool sport for 6$ two pairs"
1,Worst Socks I've ever purchased,"Don't waste your money, these socks are too thick and don't breathe at all. I use them for rags now."
2,Be carefull with this one!,"If you're out there searching for some great psychedelic 60's music and you've already picked up the Nuggets first two volumes and you're craving more, I recommend getting the Pebbles compilations or for one offs you can't beat the Arf Arf labels compilations of ultra rare and ultra obscure tunes--Paisley Pop is a compilation meant for those who were more into the ""Turtles"" type of pop music with a few psych embellishments-It has a few strong selections but not enough to justify putting it at the top of your list when there are so many better comps out there---you might even find (as I did) that some of the better tunes on Paisley Pop are on other comps (such as ""I Wish I Was Five"" by Scrugg and ""Black Veils Of Melancholy"" by Status Quo). To sum it up, if you're into albums like ""Piper At The Gates Of Dawn"" and ""S.F. Sorrow"", this compilation isn't for you--"
4,red river settlement,good history especiallya about what people went through. It's and enjoyable quick read. We need to remember history like this.
1,...Together,"I wished there was a review here before I bought this cd.Really not a good cd! This is a live performance. Must of been a small club, where Brenda Holloway tells you she hasn't sung some of these songs in years, and shes a little rusty. Which her voice cracks through out the so called performance, and the Mic. screeches at times too. Unless you like a live performance, where the artist is off-key at times. I would avoid this one.Buy Her Greatest Hits Cd It's, a Million Times Better!As it's the same songs... the untitled listings are her talking to people she knows in the crowd.. not songs!"
2,Quite dissapointing,"This dvd is indeed dissapointing. It is a flat rockumentary. The interviews are quite dull and there is not even one complete song.The audio concert sounds decent but not great.Only for die hard fans: you get a different ending version of south side of the sky, this one i liked a lot. Steve howe's solo with one acoustic song from Relayer, and the complete whitefish squire-white solo. Some new wakeman keyboard sounds too.Maybein the future they will put out a full concert dvd from the 2004 tour, with roger dean's stage. Yes guys: you owe this to us, your loyal fans."
1,Totally disapointed,"I'm have been a Yes fan ever since ""Close to the Edge"". Wow a 35th aniversary DVD and I read the track list and said to myself ""wow this must be a great concert!"". It also had 2 DVDs! So I put in the first DVD and saw a bunch of interviews about the band which were very good. I said to myself, I suppose the 2nd DVD contains the concert itself. Nope more interviews. I finally realzed that the concert was autio only with still photography. What a total waste! Dont get me wrong I think Yes are one of the best bands on the planet. When I buy DVD's of a band I expect them to be in concert with interviews as an added bonus. This particular DVD set was a complete waste of time I have no idea of what they were thinkging about with this DVD. I also bought the three CD set of the 35th aniversary music I hope its a lot better."
1,Bah!,"DTS sound for the interviews?!Dolby Digital for the audio only concert?! ( the slide show was a nice touch )Save your money to buy one of the many many other recent Yes concerts, the interviews,to me, showed a sad and tired face of these gentlemen. I love yes, I own everything that they have put out including a slew of Bootlegg shows but this one is a dog if you paid more than 10 bucks! The audio concert, which to me is the only reason to own this one is alittle on the thin sounding side."
1,waste of money,"Being a Yes fan for many years, I was very disappointed. The sound is horrible. The back ground music is too loud when the band members are speaking making it hard to understand them at times. Also, on the back cover of the dvd, there is a large list of songs which lead me to belive it was a concert film. But, much to my amazement, on the second disc, they show still photograghs while the songs play. What a load of crap. Save your money. I wish I did ($27.00 !!!)"
1,not worth it,"While Yes is a great band and I am a huge fan, this DVD is not worth the money. I bough it assuming the track list on the back was a list of songs they played. Much to my surprise, this is not a concert DVD so much as a documentary. The tracks listed are just used as background music. In one of the special features, they are played all the way through, except with a slide show over them, instead of real video. If you want a documentary about YES, then this would be an ok product (be careful, the background music can make it tough to hear the interviews), however if you are looking for a concert DVD, don't get this."
1,Do NOT buy!!!,"I bought this thinking it was going to be a full live set. I gotta admit, the song list they had sounded quite impressive. All I got was a documentary with ten second passages from the songs, and I wasn't interested in that at all. They have a full concert inside but only in audio, and it's inferior quality. If you want to see the members talk then this is for you, otherwise don't buy it. They could have a at least clearly said it was a documentary and not a live set. This is what happens when you buy something before reading online reviews!"
4,Great read for the future Fireman,My three year old son loved this book. It was nightly choice while we were on a three week trip to visit family. He learned the book very quickly and I would hear him playing out parts of the book during his daily play. The picture were pretty true to life and it was a fun book to read together.
3,Its a book.,"We honestly haven't read it yet. I got 2 fire truck books thinking they would bee kid friendly since my step-son is 3 1/2. Everyone that I have found is soo long and too technical for him. But like I said we havent read it yet. I glanced at it and put it to the side, deciding it wasnt what I wanted. Maybe in a few years he will be more interested in all it has to say."
4,Classic J.O'K,This 75 track CD is an excellent selection of Johnny O'Keefe's hit songs. The collection contains both rare and not so rare tracks and the sound remastering is excellent. The only negative features in this selection is the use of Oop Poo Pah Doo and So Tough versions two instead of the original version ones'.
4,Satisfied,"Found only later models in stores at twice the cost. This unit while just barely out of date is just as functional as the newer 710, yet is affordable. Package was complete, product works perfectly normal with no issues. I use it with a Motorola Q phone."
4,Meets Expectations,"This is my first bluetooth headset and the device meets my expectations. It is very small, lightweight, and easy to set up and use. I use the headset with a Samsung Blackjack. I am able to hear clearly and the device is sufficiently loud to use while driving. I have asked many callers whether I can be heard clearly and everyone responded positively. I purchased this item because state law requires a headset be used while driving. The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase. I also thought the price was fair."
2,When it works it works great,"I am now on my second device, and I am about to return it because of problems. Let me elaborate. I purchased this item locally. It worked wonderfully for two weeks, then died. I returned it to the store, exchanged it, and the replacement died in the process of making the first phone call with it. I am going to return it for a full refund and take my money elsewhere.I am disappointed in this model. Motorola has a solid reputation, but this model seems to have problems. When it worked, it worked very well, and I was very pleased. I just cannot endorse this particular product. Some seem to be having great success with it. I wish them the best of luck and may their devices never fail. I am washing my hands of this one, however.Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day."
2,good features but poor ear design and microphone,The headpiece offered excellent and clear service as far as features were concerned. I liked the tones in the earpiece indicating various functions including connecting to my Blackberry. The bad side was the earpiece ear loop which was always loose and gave the impression at times that the unit would fall off my ear. The final problem was when the microphone slowly died until the unit was useless. This was also the second unit that failed on me. I would not recommend considering this unit. Shop for something else.
3,Solid BT Headset,"This is the 3rd or 4th H700 I have had. I like this model because when the boom is closed, the earpiece is turned off. I carry it in my pocket, so this avoids unintended calls. Also, this model (opposed to the H710) has the same USB charging connector as my BlackBerry, so I can use the same cord.It is impossible to find one that is genuine Motorola, so I have given up the search. Instead, I accept that it will only cost me $25, and if it gives up or gets lost after 6 months, then I will buy a new one."
1,"Nice Design, Terrible Battery","Don't buy these. The battery drains even when the Bluetooth headset is off, lasts four to seven days when off. Replaced it with a Plantronics. Left the Plantronics fully charged and let it set for a month, went back to use it and it was still fully charged! I'm sold on Plantronics, no more Motorola Bluetooth for me."
1,Didn't work..,When I first received this product I charged it till the light on it turned green. Then I tried to switch it on but it just won't turn on. I tried multiple things but it didn't help. Although I must say that the seller were kind enough to respond to my complain and they emailed me a return label so I ship it back for no extra cost. Good customer service but the product was no good.
4,H700 Blue Tooth,this is the 7th one I have bought..after 3 years of having puppies around the house.. the reason I like this model is because it uses the same small usb charger that my motorola razor cell phone uses
2,"Great for my ear, bad for theirs, was over before it started.",H700; Great sound and seemed to transmit well. Easy to use with the on/off mic boom. Everyone I spoke with on land or cell said I sounded like I was in a box. Even outside the car. Noise cancellation was great. Seemed to help eliminate the non duplex conversation which occurs with so many Bluetooths that I have had. Unit did not last very long. A couple months at most. Will not purchase any more Motorola Bluetooths. They just do not provide return on the investment. Cheap should have more value.
5,Extremely Pleased,"This is a great headset. It is extremely comfortable and feels secure. I love the fact that you flip down the microphone in order to turn it on. I no longer dial my husband without realizing that my headset is on (much to his pleasure and mine). The voice quality sounds extremely good. I never have to ask the caller to repeat themselves. I've listened to myself talking on the headset by calling my home recorder and it sounded the same as when I call home and speak directly into my phone.I often use it in the car and no one has complained about not being able to hear me. The volume buttons are easy to access, and I love the hand-free prompt. It was very easy for me to pair with my phone and learn how to use this headset.If you're like me and have studied these things to death trying to decide which will be the best for you, then I wouldn't hesitate to tell you to ""just go for it"". You'll be glad you did."
1,KEEP LOOKING!,"My well-meaning husband bought this device for me as a safety measure while on the road. It's also illegal to use a cell phone when driving in NJ. Unfortunately, I've hated it since the day it arrived. The earwire is uncomfortable, gets caught in my hair or stuck outside my glasses & falls off half the time! When I'm trying to call out, I must repeat the prompted information several times, & often just pull over in frustration to fish out my cell phone. As for reception, it's really sketchy. Once in awhile, callers can hear me, but most of the time, I'm shouting into the thing while driving or walking & end up having to terminate the call early. I've awarded it one star on the strength of the handy boom which activates it, but otherwise, this is a DUD. I've been fighting with this headset for nearly two years... it's time to ditch it & spring for a better one!"
2,So - So,"I am using this item with a brand new Motorola Razor and the reception is poor most of the time. Lots of static / noise. It looks really cool but I'm somewhat disappointed. When I try to use voice command 9 times outta 10 it doesn't work. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, could be a case of getting what you pay for."
3,H700 O.K.,"I bought H700 a month ago. First I had problem to pair it with my phone and I had to call Motorola(good custumer service).Then it was O.K. But reseption some times not that good. but overal its not bad , beter then H850 Ihad before."
1,Run from this company,The first headset I was sent was DOA. I was told to pay the return shipping and a replacement unit would be sent out. I did that and received another unit and guess what..... Correct it was another defective unit. I have tried contacting the seller multiple times and they have not responded. Anybody want a good deal on a broken headset?
3,H700,"I bought this product to replace another H700 that I had broken. I am happy with the sound quality and range, but for some reason the battery on my new headset does not keep a charge. It seems like after a couple of short conversations it starts to beep and me to warn me it is dying. I am careful to take it off and close it when not in use, but it makes no difference. I just have to plug it in whenever I am at home or in my office. Other than the battery problem it works great and I would still recommend it, I assume it is just a fluke with my particular unit since my old headset is fine and the one my husband has is fine as well."
5,Excellent service,"I received my package in a verytimely manner, it was adressed correctly in excellent condition, they even called to let me know that my order is on it's way."
5,Best Bluetooth Headset I've Owned,"I've owned two older Motorola headsets and this one is much better than both of them. My husband had this model before me, and I liked it enough to buy one. Easy to use, smaller than most, sound is awesome and I love the ""flip"" feature. Highly recommend."
1,Very Poor,"The H700 headset has very poor reception. I was able to talk with the H700 but the static was absolutely horrible. I used this device for a two-week period, in a 100-mile radius of my home, and the phone was never more than 5 feet from the head set.I couldn't keep a conversation, as the words were broken. I used the device and drove over 30 miles in the Dallas area, the entire conversation was broken. I used the device in my home, full bars on my phone, the phone in my pocket, and have the same broken word conversation.The H700 has been in the trash for weeks now, and I don't think I'll purchase anything from amazon as I think everything is factory defect/reject and your company is selling junk that no knowing people will purchase.Tom Schultz"
1,worst headset ever!!!,if it were an option i would give this headset a zero. it has horrible sound quality. it is uncomfirtable and has a horrible fit. if you are a female with long hair then this headset is especially awful.
4,H700 was good for me!,I purchased this a was surprised on the quality. It does the job for what I was looking for. Hands-free operation. Noise is minimal. Not bad though.
1,Terrible sound,"Upon opening the package, I was pleased to note the tiny size, ease of use and light weight. It was as though there was nothing on my ear when I first tried it on. Pairing it to my phone was easy.Unfortunately, the sound quality was terrible. There was a continual annoying hiss, but even worse, the headset had static to the point of completely obliterating some of the conversation. When I asked a friend to use the headset to call me on my home phone, his voice was muffled and indistinct. Perhaps this was one bad headset out of a wonderful product line, but if all the H700s are like this, I would say look further. I am returning mine."
4,Great product,This is the second Motorola H700 I have had. I lost the first one. I even accidently washed it in the washing machine let it dry for a day then recharged it and it still works.
4,a solid choice,"Picked up my H700 right after Christmas and have been very pleased with it. I'm using it with a 1st-generation Motorola Q and it works pretty well. Since this is my first bluetooth headset, I don't have much to compare it to--but I'm very pleased with it's function and ""feel"" so far.A big ""plus"" for me was the fact all Moto headsets and phones both use the mini-USB standard plugs--meaning that the home and car chargers which work with my phone, my wife's phone, and our Garmin GPS also work with my Moto headset. What a concept!"
2,mototola H700,I bought this mototola bluetooth H 700 from Ace digital and I regret doing this. A lot of static and doesnt work even one feet away from phone. Even the plug is a foregn looking adapter. It almost seems like a refurbihed or defective model. My cousin bought the same thing from a regular store and his works fine. I would not recommend anyone to buy this product on line except if it is from a known store whom you can contact and get replaced if the need be.
2,"Design good, but life bad","The design of the bluetooth is nice and compact. I love the flip out mic. The ear piece holds onto my ear and doesn't shake off, either. The only complaint I have is the battery. I've had mine in use for about a month now, and within that month talk time has dropped from about 7 hours to less than 2. Charge time is less than an hour, but that steep of a descent in talk time is kind of harsh."
3,"Adequate, not great","Pros: light.Cons: Battery runs empty, even when not in use. Hard to hear with other sounds around you. People complain that it is hard to hear you.I'm not sure that any of the BT headset are much better, so I'm giving it 3 stars, instead of 2."
4,No frills but adequate at this price point,"The only thing that I can add to the the reviews already posted on this device is my own experiences - we ordered 2 of the 'bulk packaged' bundles which include the headset and the charger.Positives:- No earbud going into the ear - this is a BIG positive because I can't stand those and, apparently they are not good for you.- Quick charging.- Easy to pair - in my case with a Razr and a Blackberry.- Easy to turn on/off, by simply folding/unfolding the microphone boom.- Pretty good instructions.Negatives:- My wife complains that the sound quality is not always perfect.- Being as small as it is, perhaps some carrying pouch should have been included.At this time, my wife decided to keep hers but she will give the second one to her girlfriend as a birthday present :)"
1,Blue Tooth-Decay,"The headset didn't work, it was distorted. I spoke with customer service and I was suppose to receive a new one and it never came."
1,Poor Quality,The H700 Bluetooth did not meet my satisfaction. There was only about a hour talk time. It also is not very comfortable.
3,The packing Method for this product,What happen to the hard shell plastic these bluetooth are suppose to be in to protect it. I can't wrap this up for a christmas gift the person is going to think that I gave them something used for christmas. so I have to keep this for myself. If I orders something else please make sure it respresent for me to give to someone else as a gift. I could use it like this for myself that would be cool. But not for giving to someone else for any type of gift.
2,Is this original ?,"The order came 7 days late, not what i expected. Not so sure about the product either. It has different color, looks fake but it works."
2,"poor reseller, OK device","This item is not (or was not) stocked by Amazon. It was sold by Ace Digital Club. They gave me an international electrical plug, so I have no way of charging it unless I bought an adapter. These type of things should be listed on the product description.The product also states that it worls up to 30 feet away from the phon. I have a LG VX9800 and I get static when the phone is in my pocket and can't get more than 5 usable feet with line of site. Not even close to teh 30 feet as advertised.The audio quality is OK. Itsnot bad, its not great. The size and comfort of the unit is great. It is a lot smalller than I thought it would be.I still havn't found a bluetooth headset that I actually like. For the quality of sound and voice, I am thinkng about going back to a wired device."
2,"Works, but....","I really wanted to like the Motorola small headset. It is light and turns on and off by flipping the microphone extension. In use, it was hard to hear the other person clearly, and some times they had trouble hearing me. The noise reduction circuitry needs a lot of work."
3,Motorola Bluetooth Headset H700,"This is fine if you don't use the headset a lot. When I did use the headset, sometimes I found it difficult to hear the other party even though I had the volume up to the max."
2,hurts my ear,Sound quality is great but it just does not fit my ear. It feels like a claw clamping down on my ear. After talking on the for several minutes my ear is sore.
2,Mediocre,"I bought this headset to use w/ a Katana through Sprint. Most of the time when I'm on it, people ask me what's wrong w/ my phone. When I tell them I'm on a bluetooth, they tell me to get off of it... so really, I wasted my money. Sure it was cheap, but so it is the quality of the call. As cheap as the unit was, not even sure if it is a genuine Motorola... went to the website to try to decide, but couldn't make the determination. I'd rather have my 30-some bucks back."
3,Headset works great but charger doesn't work at all,My wife and I have had great success with this headset. It is light easy to use and durable. The problem we had with our last purchase is that the charger did not work.
2,"Works alright, but doesn't do what it claims","Well, it works alright if you are inside and the phone is right in front of you. It does not get the claimed 30 ft range, not by a long shot, I'd say it gives you about 10 maybe 12 feet. The noise reduction sucks. It does not block wind or people talking in the back ground. I can't say how it works in the car because I do not own a car and I do not drive. I can say that it does not work while riding your bike, even if you are riding slow. If you happen to live in a windy area and want to use it outside, forget it. It works alright in quiet areas and that is about it. I guess thats what you get at this price."
1,Is it really new?,"I just received my H700 and already I am disapointed. I clicked on new when ordering my headset and it has arrived with a rattle in it. Works ok; but if it is new it, why does it have a rattle or loose a piece in it! I really feel as though I got a refurbished H700! This sucks, so I guess I am through with Amazon.com and it's sellers."
4,So far... so good.,"I've owned this for a few weeks and I like it so far. I haven't had any connection problems, call clarity is good, and it connects fast. It's light on my ear, and although it always kinda feels like it's about to fall off, it never actually has. I'm using it with a Motorola Q9c (Verizon)."
4,the technology isn't there yet.,It's probably the best in the market... but it's still not good enough to be relied on or used consistantly...
4,mixed review,"This unit does the job. Its comfortable to wear. However, the volume controls are too sensitive. Its difficult to adjust the unit on the ear without pushing the buttons."
3,"great prodcut, disappointing item","I have used this headset many, many times and love the utility and ease of use. But the specific headset I received has been disappointing; something is ""loose"" inside, and it's distracting."
5,motorola bluetooth,"I am pleased with my purchase of the H700 Bluetooth. When it first arrived, it did not work. I emailed the supplier, that the unit was not charging per the directions. He emailed me he would call me, and so he did. He asked what the problem was, I said when it is charging the light is suppose to be red, but instead it remain green, as if it already was charged, but still would not work. I asked if he wanted to give me a return authorization,he said no, he would send me a new one , and this time he would check it out to make sure it would show a charge. I received it in good time and this time the H700 worked as advertised. I would reccommend the this supplier over any others, as he was very interested that I get a good unit. I could have just let it go, and sent it in to Motorola, but I went his way first, and he was very responsive. I would give this supplier a 10 rating! Thank you."
2,Stopped pairing with cell phone,This bluetooth headset worked okay at the beginning but then mysteriously stopped working. I would not buy this headset again.
2,I'll keep trying.,"Just don't like it. EXTREMELY uncomfortable in my ear. Only works well indoors, or in the car, which is what, I guess, it was designed for. I'll try a plantronics next, unless someone recommends something better."
2,Lousy product,"The headset is staticy, tinny sounding and the person on the other end says that I sound like I'm under water. The fold down speaker turns on the bluetooth which is a nice feature. And the price was right. But then again, you get what you pay for. I had a Motorola H375 and the sound was exactly the same. You think Motorola would have gotten it right by now. However, I did have a Motorola H505. It had excellent sound but the earpiece broke off. I bent up a large paperclip to replace it and it worked better than the original earpiece. (Put some tape on the paperclip, it can be a little rough on the ears.) I lost the H505 which is why I purchased the H700. No more Motorola products for me."
4,Favorite Headset,Went back to this headset after trying a fancier model. Basic headset - works fine. Especially like the flip-close - no accidental calls.
4,Motorola H700,"I love the BlueTooth. With the laws changing, regarding using electronic devices in our automobiles, this certainly is safer than the old fashion way."
3,Used it everyday for one year,"I used this headset everyday for a year before the battery went dead. I would charge it over night and it would last over an hour straight when it was new but over time the battery life would only last about half an hour. As for the sound quality, As the listener, I thought it was great. It was as clear as the phone. My wife would complain though when I would use it while talking to her. She could tell a difference on the other end and didn't like me using it.All in all after considerable use of this product, I would not recommend this product. I love my Motorola Razr phone, but with the H700 the negatives out weigh the positives. It is compact, wireless, and good listening quality, but the battery time/life are small, and the microphone quality are poor."
1,Works part time at best,"This is a horrible product, it only works half the time and even when it works it is mostly hard for the person you call to hear.When I use it in the morning it is clear to the person I call about 25% of the time, in the afternoon I do not bother to even use it. Back when I purchased it the retail was $129, I got it on sale at $80. Over the two years I have owned it I have used it on two cell phones, no difference.For some reason on rainy days it is very clear, otherwise the person I call has problems hearing me. I hear fine, but having to repeat many times defeats the purpose of making the call. Not one person I have called has been able to hear me unless clearly I turn off the H700 and use my cell phone."
1,Non-responsive customer service,"I ordered this product as a replacement for an identical headset that was lost.The new headset performed very badly compared to the old headset. It would start crackling at about 10 feet away from the phone and was even affected if I held the phone on my left and the headset on my right or vice versa. My old (identical model) headset was able to receive clearly for over 25 feet, and even through a wall, this one does not. I sent 3 emails to the supplier, but received no response. Also, the new headset did not arrive in original packaging - although it was not advertised as 'bulk packaged'."
2,"Hard to pair, boom breaks easily","I bought 3 of these: 1 for me and the other 2 as Xmas gifts last year. All were hard to pair. The instructions that come with it were not even correct! But with help on the Internet and Google, I found enough advice to get them paired. I used mine extensively for several months. A few weeks ago, I discovered the mic in mine was not working correctly and people couldn't hear me. I also found out the people I had given them to as gifts had given up on them because they wouldn't pair or connect and after looking into it, it appears they both have a bad connection between the boom and the earpiece. The 10 months or so when mine worked it worked pretty well which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. But to have bought 3 and all 3 be worthless less than 12 months from purchase is not a good track record and I will look elsewhere for a replacement."
3,Replacement Bluetooth,"I lost my previous bluetooth headset recently and bought this one as a replacement. It seems to work as well as my previous headset, but pairing it with my phone was difficult. The pairing instructions that came with this headset did not work. I tried repeatedly to pair it and finally dug up the instructions that came with my previous headset and paired it using the other instructions. It works as well as the previous headset. The charger that came with it is a regular household charger. I am not sure where the term ""travel"" charger originated. The term ""travel"" charger is a bit misleading as it would make some believe it is a car charger, which it is not."
1,absolute junk,"got this to replace my 710 which was damaged in water. No one can hear me, it was a waste of my time and money.very disappointed motorola usually makes good bluetooth headsets."
1,Not a good product,People complained about echo whenever i use the bluetooth. Wouldn't connect easily to phone.
2,"Quite Good, but Not For Long","I bought 4 of them, different places, different times.I charge every time I don't use them.Until now, I have 1 left working...All of them have the same problem, after a period of time, around one year or less, nobody can hear me on the phone but I can hear them very well."
1,Sorry,This product didn't work it was sent to me broken and I tried to take it to the store and it didn't work.
2,Headset,I always loved the first one of these I bought. It got washed so I bought another. Now I know that it isn't very long before everyone says they can't hear you. Doesn't last very long at all.
5,excellent device,The clarity is similar to talking on a wired telephone. The flip open to turn on is a handy and battery saving feature. It instantly connects to my cell. I highly recommend it.
2,Size=Best and Sound=Zero,Put your face in mud and speak - that's how this thing sounds to your listeners.
3,Cute device,This is a really a cute little device but I was dissappointed when the volume was not that high. I also received alot of static could not be a foot away from my phone. I loved it because it was small and easy to use. I had to return the product.
4,Motrola Bluetooth Headset H711,The headset is light weight and the reception is clear. Sometimes it can be hard to determine whether the head set is on or off because there is no indicator.
2,"I can hear very well, but others barely hear me with volume turned up",I stop using the product after the first week and 5 person told me that could barely hear my voice while I was speaking loudly in the car.
2,People have trouble hearing me when I use this headset,I have had this headset for nearly a year. It worked great for about two months and then people started to complain that they could not hear me clearly. The noise cancelling feature has not worked well on my H700 because many people have complained of road noise when I am driving. I will be purchasing another headset because of the poor performance of this one.
5,Excellent bluetook headset,"This is a well functioning, well designed device. It charges quickly. You have the option of charging from a wall outlet which is faster, or by USB. Its very light weight and not bulky. Most of the time i can't tell I am wearing it. The battery life is great for most people. extremely talkative ""teeny bopers"" would be advised to get a different device."
1,motorola h700 bluetooth,Manufacturer advertizes that this particular model affords 6 hours of talk time between charges. The one I purchased provides less than 60 minutes talk time between charges.
3,Not bad,Pros- Good sound quality- Great looksCons- Not great battery life- Wrong instructions in user manual on how to sync up
4,Works very well,"I'm very happy with my Blue tooth headset. Flip it open and it's on and connected to my phone before I can hook it on my ear. My last headset would not connect about half the time I tried to use it. If there are any complaints, I would have to say that sometimes the party I'm talking to has a bit of trouble hearing me, but it seems to be because the mic was not quite pointing toward my mouth. Overall I'm very happy with this headset."
2,Cherry picked,"This documentary fits it's agenda and that is to Promote the use of midwives and make aware the disarray of the US maternity system. I found many points valid however most information is ""cherry picked"" or any other words ""half truths."" It is true that maternity care in the U.S. Is in dire need of reformation. However this film is very biased and on several points inaccurate. Ex. Epidural use is linked to teenage drug abuse and suicide. Really. I personally had a completely natural birth, I share a family bed, breastfed my son for 17mo, and use cloth diapers.... And even I by the end of this film wanted to punch that man in the face. Especially after his comments regarding his daughters NICU stay. I'd say watch it, certainly don't take it a gospel."
1,Annoying!,"My husband and I watched this movie together as we are currently expecting. I made it further than my husband (almost to the end), but we still turned it off early because we were so frustrated and annoyed with the husband/filmmaker! We are opting to have our baby in a birthing center and definitely support a more natural approach to birth, but I agree with the other comments that say the filmmaker's attitude towards hospitals was ridiculous and over the top. He seemed so hell bent on making his point that by the end of the movie I was not sure I could even trust some of the information given. Even after the hospital staff saved his baby's life, all he could do was complain that the nurses wanted to hold her too much! Gimme a break! Yes, there are reasons to be informed and skeptical towards birthing in a hospital, but the way he portrayed hospitals and the people who work in them got to be pretty offensive. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. The filmmaker is a dopey dumbo."
1,Skip it,"There are far better films about childbirth and homebirth vs hospital birth (see The Business of Being Born). The film makers of Pregnant in America are inexperienced and the film is difficult to watch on a technical, as well as a cognitive, level. The narrative and narration is slow and frustrating. Important pieces of information are dropped and then never dealt with or fully explained. Do not watch this film if you are pregnant! In fact, skip it all together. My husband and I feel we wasted 2 hours of our evening."
1,Sickening,"The movie is badly done on a technical level, especially the way interviews are cut. However, I could easily look past that if it weren't for...The father creating this film is narcissistic, aggressive and puts very little of his wife into the film. She's the one having the baby, yet we get precious little of her perspective. It's all about the father, who is rude and self-absorbed.Friends, we all know the medical side of childbirth in this country is often behind the times, compared to other countries and pro-natural research. However, treating medical staff like evil villains does nothing to improve anything. I've known several OB/GYN's and hospitals who are adamantly for natural childbirth and respecting the Mother Nature. There is no need to make sweeping assumptions that all doctors are crooks, which is essentially what this film does.The comment at the end about ""managing"" the NICU staff... So arrogant!"
3,Could of been better,"I expected it to be a bit better. The end wasnt really interesting, and overall, it could of had better information. They should of had more volunteers. I've seen better dvds about natural birth. It was ok, so i'm giving it a 3 star."
1,Just Bad,"I generally like to say good things in a review, but this movie was just bad. It lacks wit or insight. Unless you just gave birth and finished breast feeding and are looking for a drinking game (every time the director is mean to a hospital worker for no reason take a shot), AVOID."
1,Mooching off his wife for his fame,"The dad made this birth completely about him and what he wanted. His wife is crying because she's overwhelmed and scared making the movie and their first child at the same time and he sticks the camera in her face. She was in pain and wanted medication and to go to the hospital and he wouldn't let her. Their baby couldn't breath and he finally allowed her to go to the hospital. He even flat out says ""It was my decision to make."" Like the mom had no say. And then he STILL blames the docs and makes them out to be evil. I've had a natural childbirth and would love to do it again, but this was a propaganda film created by a misogynist who wants to control women's birth experience just as much as the doctors do."
1,"Film has wrnog title - should be ""Hospital & Epidural Bashing"" instead of Pregnant in America",This film is NOT about being Pregnant In America. It is about a bashing of c-sections and epidurals. Plan and simple.Note to self: do not have a baby with the maker of this film!!!Good thing I watched it on my phone at work; otherwise I'd beg God to give me back that 90 minutes of my life.
5,"Exceptional performance, great transcription","This performance of both Brahms and Shostakovich is warm, genuine and subtle. It is due to these qualities that some professional reviewers cannot comprehend this great recording. Fortunately for some of us, we never read them."
4,Representing the dirty south!,"This CD is a classic! When I first bought this alblum, I listen to it, and this CD was off the chain! She is the Queen of crunk! Rasheeda has been putting it down scince she use to do a duet with a rap group called DA Kaperz! You can never find this record in stores. You have to order this alblum on amazon babe! She really put it down for the underground! And i know there is a lot of underground female rappers that put it down like LaChat,H.W.A.(Hoes Wit Attitudes),Khia,Jackie-O,and so on! Go Cop this alblum on amazon! Believe me it's worth it!"
3,BORDER-LINE CASSIC,"IN GENERAL THE ALBUM WAS GOOD,BUT IT LACKED THE HARDCORE BOUNCE EFFECT THAT HER PREVIOUS TRACKS CONTAINED.TRACKS LIKE""DO IT""GIVE YOU THE CLUB ATMOSPHERE WHILE THE REST ARE MORE LOW TEMPO.IF YOU LIKE THE PASTOR TROY ALBUMS THEN THIS IS A DEFINITE PICK."
2,A collection of some of Faulkner's earliest prose.,"This collection of short prose pieces was originally published in the _New Orleans Time Picayune_ in 1925; however, I'm not sure that Faulkner would be entirely pleased that they have been re-exposed to the light of day. The writing is rough, even amateurish, and the story lines of the pieces are often trite and stock. But in spite of the general weakness of the writings, there are thematic elements and character types in the pieces that would reappear in Faulkner's mature writings. What is absolutely amazing is that just two years after the publication of these mediocre writings, Faulkner had published two novels and was deeply involved in the creation of his masterpiece, _The Sound and the Fury_."
5,Perfect,Lionel Fastrack are easy to snap together unlike some tracks I have dealt with in the past. They are sturdy & well worth the money.
5,Good Job,Received on time ans as listed. I would order this again. It was cheaper than any order place I checked
5,Excellent Blades,I bought PIAA blades a year ago for the front of my minivan and just now bought one for the rear window. Even after a year the front blades do an excellent job and the water still beads up on the glass. Over 45 mpg I don't even need the wipers to be working as the rain just blows off.
5,As described,I find this wiper a little better than what you find at the Zone or similar. Is more money tho so I guess ya get what ya pay for.
1,Bad Waranty,"This product performs well but after the warranty, which is ONLY two years, you are on your own. My AVS-2000 is gone bad and is out of warranty and is worthless; $1600 out the window after two years."
1,AVS 2000 Repair,"This is a nice device when it works but when it breaks out of waranty you're stuck. When a company sells a device for this much money they should create multiple avenues for their customers to get their products fixed. Monster has only provided avenues for getting their devices fixed while under waranty. When their products are out of waranty, their solution is for the customer to replace it at the customers expense. I fix 50 to 60year old tube amps (rewire, retube, and recap) and I can easily find parts for them. The service group at Monster can't provide replacements components for something made in the last 10 years. If somebody from Monster would like to discuss this Patrick Palaad has my contact information. Sincerely, Derek"
2,Merely a rant,"Spelling and grammar errors throughout. A poorly organized, repetitious and self-pitying rant from a crime victim which offers no insight to the reader. Worthy of a personal journal but not for publication."
2,Mild and innocuous time waster,"This comedy stars Renee Zellweger as a Kansas waitress who gets amnesia after the brutal murder of her husband and believes she is part of her favorite soap opera. She flees to Los Angeles with the murderers in hot pursuit because the drugs they are after are hidden in her car. Eventually she meets up with the soap opera star of her dreams and complications follow.The best thing I can say about this film is that Renee Zellweger looks pretty and that the story held my interest somewhat. But instead of laughing at the supposedly funny parts, I just opened my eyes in amazement about how stupid it was. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are cast as the murderers and their racial stereotyping was insulting. The rest of the cast did the best that they could but the material was just plain silly. This film was nothing but a time waster. But sometimes that's all we want out of a film, something mild and innocuous. Once in a while, that's o.k."
2,Not Entertaining,"I don't know if this is meant to be a comedy, a love story, or maybe yet another of those pseudo-moralizing movies. No matter what it is, it just doesn't work. Nurse Betty is stuffed with clichés and there is far between the good laughs.The only plus is Renée Zellweger's not just good but amazing acting. She's so natural, so human. One of today's few great actresses!"
1,one of the worst I've seen,"If there was a minus star, thats what I would have given this film. If Chris Rock wasn't in it, I might have given it the one star. what a disappointment. Just look at how many you can buy used and that should tell you something right there."
4,What a Wacky Concept,"From the cover and the trailer of the movie, you might not know what the heck is going on in the film called Nurse Betty. I have to say that the story is original. And just for that fact, I really love this movie. Not only does it have one of the best casts that has been in a movie for awhile, but the movie is really funny. The story focuses on Betty (Zellweger), a house wife who works on occasion at the local town diner. She is also obsessed with a soap opera called A Reason to Love. Mainly she is in love with the main star of the show, Greg Kinnear. When her car dealer husband is axed, Betty loses it and goes into a state of shock. From then on the movie is one funny romp that evokes more than a few laughs. If you're in the mood for an entertaining movie with stars like Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear, and Renee Zellwegger, then this is one to check out."
4,Hilarious!,"This is one of the oddest movies to come along in a while, but it's great. Funny and original. Neil LaBute is 3 for 3 so far, after directing In the Company of Men and Your Friends and Neighbors. Keep an eye on him and his favorite actor Aaron Eckhart, he's been in all three film. They've formed a Scorcese-DeNiro link. As for the dvd, great stuff: some importent deleted scenes, all the scenes from the soap opera within the movie uncut, and multiple commentary tracks. Well worth the money."
2,Huh?,"I should have remembered it was possible for a movie to have a well written screenplay and an awfully silly, plodding plotline. The basic concept behind ""Nurse Betty"" sounds great on the back of a video box, or a 30 second pitch - the perfect *black comedy* setup, which pokes fun at both the hollywood ego AND the losers who stalk the egomaniacs, who is in turn stalked by a couple of interesting hit men - but when it's on screen, the plot goes ""kablooe."" The writing works, but it should have been a short story, and not a 90+ minute movie. I love black comedies, movies that ""Nurse Betty"" was striving to be - this is not that movie. Sorry."
2,a godawful mess,"This movie by Neil LeBute is a total waste of talent. It is a uselessly meanspirited movie. It's so unfunny and vicious that you can feel the great Morgan Freeman cringing through his lines. The premise, about a woman whose life is so bleak she creates a soap opera fantasy world, is much better served by Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, which handles a similar topic but with depth, originality and intelligence."
4,Forest Gump meets Fargo,"Don't go to see this movie if you are expecting a light comedy. I was reminded of Fargo's wood-chipper scene when Billy Baldwin disposes of the ""evidence"". Nonetheless, ""Betty"" was well worth the trip."
4,My favorite Renee Zellweger movie,"In concert with the full-out marketing blast for the premiere of 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,' I see imdb.com is today asking its browsers to vote for their favorite Renee Zellweger film. Though I love her Bridget Jones portrayal (she had to win over a skeptical England, after all) and she'll forever be Dorothy (You had me at 'Hello') Boyd, I'll cast my vote for her less-remembered title character role in Neil LaBute's 'Nurse Betty.'This is a movie that defied definition and, as a result, a box office ($25M for a film that cost $24M to produce). But it shouldn't prevent you from seeing it. There are great performances from Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, Chris Rock and especially Greg Kinnear as the shallow Dr. David Ravell/George McCord, the object of Zellweger's bizarre fixation."
4,A LOT of Fun!,"Arguably the best part of this nifty little movie is Morgan Freeman's performance as a hitman searching the country for Nurse Betty. His is the sort of role that can easily be overdone: the soul-searching, bookish hitman about to retire, on the cusp of some new experience that will expand his self understanding. Were this exaggerated, or presented too deadpan, it would have been a disaster, but Freeman's performance is pitched perfectly between the comic and the serious.Overall, the movie is an awful lot of fun. Some of the humor is pretty dark (I was shocked at some of the gruesomeness I was laughing at), but most of it is screwy and light. Renee Zellweger is hard not to like, and she's as loveably dingy in this as she's ever been. The writing is clever, and fresh. Chris Rock is...well, Chris Rock. Nothing new there, except a little bit more restraint.See this movie."
2,"Well acted, but a strange mixture.","We just saw this on TV. It was enjoyable enough to watch, but I'm glad I didn't rent it or buy it. The humor and violence don't mix well, I think."
1,More DiStUrBiNg than FuNnY!,"Not exactly what I would call a ""feel-good"" movie. The violence was a huge surprise - a gory huge surprise. I thought it was a comedy - c'mon Greg Kinnear, Chris Rock, Morgan Freeman & Renee Zellweger - how could it miss? It does. The only reason I kept watching was because I spent $$$ on the DVD and I am an eternal optimist and hoped it would get better. It didn't. This one is going on E-Bay...."
2,"Dear G-D, run from this movie!","I rented this movie, thinking ""OH, it'll be funny and I'm sure I'll enjoy it.""Boy was I wrong! THis was like a sugary Nightmare! If I ran into someone like Betty, I'd pull my hair out and scream at the top of my lungs!! SHe is perhaps the most annoying character in the movies of recent years! I didn't feel any sympathy for her.The setup was alright, but the storyline was completely fake and forced. THe Hispanic woman who lends her house to Betty? FAKE. The relationship between Morgan and Chris's characters? Unrealistic, not to mention embarassingly unfunny! (The ""Bland CAnyon"", that's a joke anyone can come up with). The ending? Just plain boring and anti-climactic.I can't believe any of these big, talented stars wasted their time with this movie. IT was a big fat waste of time."
1,Sick Humor,"This movie tried to be funny, but the beginning with a scalping, it's just aweful and not funny at all.. I'm not even sorry i ruined this part of the movie for you, cuz you don't want to see this anyway...The trailer was good, and it seemed like it could be funny, but its a very sick and disgusting movie, with a black comedy that i find revolting.Don't waste your time."
4,"Entertaining Romp from Kans, thru the Bagdad Cafe...","....to La La Land. Zellweger will have you astounded. Freeman plays a mobster with a sentimental side. Rock rocks (although the writers could have let on that he dug the same soap opera much earlier in the game). Kinear shows that he can be as smarmy as the two after the girl in the Buick. Note to La Bute followers who have not seen this: it ain't ""In the Company of Men"". But a nice film, nonetheless."
3,"Sick, but Funny !","This is one seriously sick movie, but it made me laugh anyway. There's a lot of violence, including a really sick scene where the two bad guys get vengeance on a sleazy trucker, so if violence offends you, don't watch this movie... and it's DEFINITELY NOT FOR KIDS ! Really! Sometimes a movie gets an ""R"" rating just because of a couple of f-words; this one really is for adults only ! I won't go into plot details, as prior reviewers have covered the storyline quite adequately, but I will recommend the movie based on its weird humor and the fine performances by Zellweger, Freeman and Rock. If you like offbeat, black humor, you'll probably enjoy ""Nurse Betty."""
4,Suprisingly Enjoyable Dark Comedy,"Usually I try to avoid so-called ""screwball"" comedies, but ""Nurse Betty"" would more aptly be labeled in the region of black comedy.This fantasy has some great moments, most of them being between Rock and Freeman. In a mild Pulp Fiction ripoff, Freeman is another in a seemingly endless parade of philosophical hitmen, yet Freeman's hitman is so good and amusing that you forgive the farmiliarity. Rock shines as always and portrays a more amoral and violent man.The soap opera aspects are interesting, as we see how people use them to escape from staid, difficult existences.A scalping, a dash of romance, aspirations of nursing, and a nice depiction of ordinary folk combine to make this a dynamic film that manipulates endlessly, but you will forgive."
2,Not at all what you are lead to believe.,The painfully graphic violence carried out by the Chris Rock character throughout the show ruins an otherwise good (not great)movie. It is out of place and way over the top. Disturbing that they would bill this as a comedy. Don't let the advertising fool you.
3,Quite A Disappointment,"When renting this movie I was expecting a fairly good movie based on the reviews it had received in the past.I was expecting Morgan Freeman to be the main actor with Chris Rock as his co-actor.Instead,I had the pleasure of watching Renee Zellweger chase her soap opera love for one hour and thirty minutes and tell everyone her hardly awe-inspiring story.This was truly a let-down movie."
2,Not very good movie,"From the Previews I had seen I thought that this movie was going to be a good one.What I saw made me what to ask for my monie back. I thought that the movie was horrible.The plot is that a woman sees her husband killed in a way that is very bad and she thinks that she is a character on a soap opera that she watches. The plot might have been bariable with better acting, but even Renee Zellweger and Greg Kinnear who are good actors did not do a very good job in this movie."
1,Not funny and very disturbing,"I would give this no stars, but they don't give you that option. This is not one of your feel good movies, unless you're a psycho. This movie attempts to make light of a girl who is having a nervous breakdown after witnessing a murder. Wow, how exciting. If you want to see a funny movie with Rene rent Me, Myself, and Irene but avoid this one, it's not worth the money to rent. Unless you like movies that make light of murder and people with mental problems, then by all means rent this movie."
1,from nurse ratchet to nurse betty...,Yet another inacurate picture of what nurses do and what the level of responsibility is. Where did wardrobe find the circa 1965 white outfit with the hat? No nurse I know behaves or dresses like that!
2,A Diabolical Romp Through a Thoroughly Odd Story,"Every once in a while you wander through the isles of your local video store and pick a movie just because there are so many of them lining the walls that it ""must be good."" Such was the case with Nurse Betty. Upon watching the movie, I remain baffled at its success. I won't give the plot away, but Nurse Betty's ridiculous romp in search of her soap operah heart-throb was poorly constructed and tedious. Chris Rock is a foulmouth sidekick for Freeman (who pulls off the best performance of the movie but one of the worst in his career.) It however, not entirely without redemption, there are moments of comedy, and the occasional plot twist.My advice; there is no reason to cross this movie off your ""to see"" list, but make sure that it is well down it!"
3,Cute,"This is a cute movie,it's good to rent and watch for one time, but I don't think it's a collectors best choice."
3,Decent film that is a little out there.,"Nurse Betty is an enigma among Neil Labute body of work as an director but it's a fine movie because if the performances, Especially the one giving by Renee Zellweger, Morgan Freeman, and Chris Rock. They make this weird and engrossing road movie into a strange and deprave look at obsession, and popular culture. Considering Labute past work, this is no way as profound or as powerful as In the Company of Men and The Shape of Things but it's miles better than his lackluster love epic Possession."
2,Horrible movie....,"""Nurse Betty"" has got to be one of the dumbest movies that I have ever seen! It centers around the life of a waitress named Betty, whose life revolves around her favorite soap opera. One night, Betty witnesses the murder of her dirtbag husband in their home, and goes into shock. She leaves her midwestern hometown to track down her favorite soap star, whom she wants to marry. Betty's illusions are that the star is a real doctor, that she is a real nurse, and that the couple was previously engaged! In the meantime, the two killers follow Betty's trail, when they find out she witnessed the murder. Labeled a comedy\thriller, this movie was moronic, and, at times, a little too violent. Don't waste your time and money seeing this one."
5,Great movie.,"This movie is filmed in 2000. Comparing with the movies these days Nurse Betty has a lot of substance. That's why I give it five stars.The high point is at the hospital scene Nurse Betty found out that the doctor she admired and went to bed together is not real.I like these scenes at the Monument Valley, Arches National Park and Grand Canyon.Nurse Betty's roommate in LA is very good. I like her. Her face expressions and acting are fantastic. Of course the rest of the actors are super. Rene Zellweger is the best again and she is like the real Nurse Betty."
5,Clever Fun Comedy,"I have to give this 5 stars just for the amazing scenes with Betty and the soap star. Supporting actors Freeman and Rock as the father son hitman team are nice comic relief, but they merit their own movie. No matter how funny they were, Zellweger owns this movie and it suffered every second she wasn't onscreen."
2,How many ideas can you patch together from other movies?,"Starting with Purple Rose of Cairo & Fargo & lots of others. The acting is good, I'll say that much, Zellweger in particular. Freeman is always great, he's a giant & tragically under-utilized. But this movie cops out about 3/4 of the way thru & the endings (there are 2 because the 2 hit men & Betty have virtually separate story lines almost till the end) must have been written by a committee of studio junior execs. Pathetic. Oh, Allison Janney was great as usual, but Greg Kinnear should fire his agent for always getting him the same ... part to play."
4,A True Star Among Us!,"Don't know if I liked this movie or not. But the one thing I do know is that we have a true star among us by the name of Renee Zellweger whose talent should not be underestimated. After seeing her in a few films recently, I have come to the conclusion that she is an acting genius who makes all the other flashy top Hollywood stars of her age pale in comparison (yes, I mean Roberts, Bullock, etc., ect.).See this film for this amazing perforance if nothing else. Besides it never gets boring. Besides there also is Morgan Freeman who I'd walk a mile to see in any film. His last scene with Zellweger is very, very beautiful. Unforgettable really.What a trip!"
5,Interesting story line,"A great look into man's inner thoughts, a very good story line and makes you want to read the next episode"
3,Not horrible,Slow paced. Not exciting or even overly interesting. But its somthing to read before bed. The characters grow on you. ive read worse.
3,Neptune crossing,It was good except the silence fugue...Not knowing it's conception made it hard to understand....maybe if I had read previous books with this Character it would have been easier
3,A bit heavy on the religious morality . . .,The premise of the story was believable - and the working of the Mormon doctrine into the story fit well. I'd like to see more before I deliver a final opinion.
1,neptune crossing,This was a good story until the author had to have profanities bantered about as if the reader should just accept it. I didn't; and deleted it.
1,Good Arthur but very slow,The book was written well but I got very board waiting for something to happen. The main charter did not thing but complain and it moved so slow at half way through the book and gave up.
2,Not enough thought.,"Carver shows some talent in this book but it is spoiled by carelessness. For example, without giving anything away, the alien dies, gets better and dies again, each time without a word of explanation; and he has discovered that a comet is on a collision course with Earth but doesn't know which one or when! And the high-tech devices used by the hero are just too much like magic. I will not be reading Carver again till he gets better reviews."
4,I enjoyed it.,"There's an alien who swears that earth is about to be destroyed, so trust him and he'll save everyone - but first give him complete access to the internet and let him learn everything about Earth. Our hero wonders if he's sane, wonders if he's helping an invasion, wonders if he's saving the world. I thought it was well written and engaging - ok, not quite on the level of Niven and Pournelle, but good.There are sequels and I will read them."
4,"Not brilliant, not bad","This is a modest affair but it was free so I will cut the story some slack. The science is pretty good but not too much. The plot is, well, basic but good enough to finish."
3,Neptune Crossing by Jeffrey Carver,"This was a fun book. I like ""hard"" science fiction and this was just technical enough without getting bogged down in math/science. I look forward to reading the 2nd book in the series."
3,compelling? Not,"This was one of the first indie books I read, and although there are good ideas in it, there's something that is not working. I expected something more ""hard"", according to how it started, and not what I found along those pages (or screens, as this is a digital item). The good thing is that it is a book easy to read. The worst, the characters. Sometimes, I felt that they were ""performing"" instead of being."
5,Well written,This was a very decent work with lots of plot twists and well worth the investmment of my time in reading it. This falls under the category of first contact.
3,Disapointed and aggravated,"I really wanted to like this book alot and just couldn't. I found the main characters imperfections more aggravating than endearing and found myself yelling at him (out loud) at one point because he was annoying me. His personnel hangups were more distracting than adding to the story line. I'm debating if I really want to bother reading the sequel to see what happens.I did appreciate the way internal dialog with the alien was visually handled. You could easily figure out who was ""talking"" to whom. The story line did have alot of potential I just think the main characters interpersonal relationships distracted from the story rather than added to it."
4,Great Book -- Read this and the Sequels,"This book combines hard sci-fi with a bit of humor to create an interesting story. Keeps you interested and wanting for more, which is provided in the sequels. Maybe alien ""inhabitation"" of human minds isn't so bad after all..."
2,It Could Not Pull Me In,"This book came highly recommended from a variety of different sources. However it failed to move me as it moved my friends. I suspect part of this is due to the Doctor Who reboot, which I'm sure in some part was inspired by this novel (the novel came out first!). Having watched most of the new series I was already familiar with most of the content. Instead of feeling the excitement and awe of the other viewers, I felt like I was rehashing an old story.Though some of it was the characters. In Science Fiction I generally forgive stale characters as the setting tends to the real protagonist. I could not connect with any of the characters, they did not seem real to me."
1,Geezus!,"Shame on ME! I didn't read the editor's review. I saw the name Ken Blanchard, reconized him from his minute manager series and thought it would be a good choice for my diverse group. IT'S NOT! Unless you are a fundamentalist Christian who wants to hear a constant barrage faith-based drivel and mind-numbing jesusisms - this DVD is not for you. I will give Blanchard credit for finding the handful of leaders who aren't greed driven. Hmmm, wonder what their employees think?"
2,Beauty and the Beast A Dark Tale,"I was really disappointed in this movie but, again, it was my choice to purchase it. I have all the other Beauty and the Beast movies so needed this one to complete my set."
2,Beauty and the Beast: A Dark Tale,"This Beauty and the Beast is a very different take on the well known Fairy Tale. The King is near death and needs an heir, as his son had died as an infant. This movie has lots of twists and turns involving evil relatives, witch, deadly troll, a horribly twisted and scared man in the woods and a beautiful girl named Beauty. However, nothing is ever what it seems. It eventually has a happy ending, with the message that goodness overcomes evil. It is not appropriate for teens or children, strictly for adults. It may appeal to individuals enjoying a darker type of story."
1,Ruined...,Wow...when I saw the trailer I thought it would be ok. The movie was terrible! The acting sucked and it seemed so rushed. I'll be re-gifting this.
4,A New Victorian Mystery Series,"This is a new series to me, and although this book is currently out of print I had it brought in by my library since it's the first book in the series. I enjoyed the story. Detective Cribb and his sidekick are quite unique and the setting is certainly so. It takes place during a six day foot race. These were apparently quite common in the Vicotrian age, where participants would go around a track inside a building for six days - totally 624 miles. They take time off for eating and sleeping (about 3 hours a night), but the winner is the one who completes the most miles in the allotted time. This is a pretty good mystery, and the hero is wonderful. Don't expect an Anne Perry, but the story is entertaining. I intend to read the others in the series."
3,Wobble to Death,"An interesting historical mystery set in the 19th Century and in England, with an adequate but not exciting plot. Some surprises."
2,"editor, please!","While the subject is quiet interesting, the book is poorly written and edited. The author keeps on repeating himself over and over and over and over again. And again. One is reminded of college papers where a student is stretching a 2 page point over 10 pages to fulfill the length requirement, constantly restating the same thought with synonymous nouns and adjectives. Could have been a much more fun 150 page read with some good editing, or a great 10 page New Yorker article. The book does improve in the second half."
2,Beyond the Fringe,"I knew of the English play from years ago and thoughtit was very humorous. However, when I started listeningto the CD I had such difficulty understanding the dialogue that I ended up throwing away the CD."
3,Dr. Thomas McPherson Brown's protocol for scleroderma,"This book describes the method of treating rheumatic disease, including scleroderma, used by Dr. Thomas McPherson Brown for over 50 years. Dr. Brown believed that scleroderma is triggered by infection, and his low-dose, intermittent antibiotic protocol is used to eliminate this infectious cause. We have seen hundreds of scleroderma patients reverse their symptoms using this protocol. The doctors using this approach can number their patients in the thousands. The recent Beth Israel trial bore out these findings. This book describes this therapy and should be read in conjunction with 'The New Arthritis Breakthrough' by the same author."
5,A must read for RA or Sclerderma Patients,"I have a patient with Sclerderma on this therapy and the condition is reversing! Not bad for an incurable disease. This is a book written for patients and non-medical personnel, but is extremely helpful for both.I highly recommend the book and therapy."
1,A Deceptive Book,"This book is an advertisement for one method to treat scleroderma based on a limited test. As a long time scleroderma patient, two considerations struck me: first, the book is depressingly reckless in the use of words like fatal and death. The overutilization of the negative image borders on irresponsible. Second, alternative approaches to treatment that have helped some people are totally dismissed. I would also add that the reader will learn very little about scleroderma as such from this book other than by gleaning from the examples. A much more responsibly balanced approach is taken in Maureen Mayes' ""The Scleroderma Book."""
1,this book represents is dangerous; great disservice,There is no proven efficacy to the therapies described. The book is dangerous as it provides false hopes and expectations. Patients with scleroderma should consult with a rheumatologist who is familiar with this deadly disease.
1,A poorly intentioned effort to promote a book & a foundation,As the former president & one of the founders of the Scleroderma Federation I was disturbed at this attempt to sell a book & promote a foundation. I can't recommend it for Scleroderma patients. See a Rheumatologist!
3,Every scleroderma patient needs to read this book.,"This is a layman's guide for a new treatment for scleroderma. It discusses the medical research which led to the discovery that long term antibiotic use can improve symtoms, and even cure. As a long term scleroderma patient, I have benefitted from this treatment and I know others who have been cured. There are some rheumatologists who are beginning to follow this treatment approach, despite objections from mainstream rheumatologists . I believe the consumer should decide for themselves."
5,Marvelous and Subtle,"Another marvelous recording by this shockingly underrated pianist. This is a series of duets with two Japanese musicians, Yoshiaki Masuo (on guitar) and Terumasa Hino (on trumpet and flugelhorn). The album begins with the crystalline ""Mavrodaphne,"" moves on to the song of Beirach's that Stan Getz used to love to play, ""Broken Wing,"" and unfolds from there with a searching, subtle melancholy. The playing is highly sensitive -- Masuo sounds almost like an early John Abercrombie, and Hino's horns are silken. The album's sequence allows the emotional force of the improvisations to build with each track, and Beirach's solo reading of ""Black is the Color of My True Love's Hair"" is exquisite. (Is this where Fred Hersch got the idea for his devastating version of that tune?) All of Beirach's music should have a wider audience, and if Bill Evans and Jim Hall's ""Undercurrent"" is your idea of sublimity, you might love this."
3,Young John Barrowman,Great fan of Captain Jack Harkness so I just had to hear his voice in something I recognized. Still one of his biggest fans just not one for this album.
5,Ready to go!!!,"I was a bit skeptical of this book's length, but now that I've read it, I can honestly say it's the best book that I've read on the subject. It goes through all of the steps of choosing your country, getting ready, dealing with culture shock, and having fun. And the advice from other students who've been abroad was great! When I go abroad to Italy next semester, I really feel prepared. I definitely recommend this book to any student going abroad!"
2,"Helpful, but NOTTHE BEST","I'm a student that is currently studying abroad (August 2003-August 2004). I bought this book about a month before I left and skimmed it. It's a pretty small book (only 69 pages) and didn't tell me much that I hadn't already learned from talking to previous students, going to the group orientation, and over-thinking every detail (as I normally do). I can say that this book is very clearly organized and easy to follow. I just feel that the content is lacking. I would recommend this book if you are *thinking* about studying abroad and haven't done much research. Personally by the time I acquired this book I had done a TON of research and this information was all things that I already knew. I recommend Dowell & Mirsky's ""Study Abroad: How to Get the Most of Your Experience"" for those of you who want lots of information to be prepared for anything!"
3,"Good book, but not good enough.","This book is short and useful, but not comprehensive. ""Study Abroad for Dummies"" is a much better book and is about five times as useful as this short book."
4,Orgasmic Music,"David Ruffin is one of the milestones of the Motown sound. I have a collection of music I refer to as Orgasmic Music, music that sends chills up you spine and is the epitome of love songs like Joan Armitrading's ""Love and Affection"", Cicago's ""If You Leave Me Now"", to mention but two. David's ""Walk Away From the Love"" will send chills up your spine and encite goosebumps on your flesh - guaranteed!The only downside to this CD is first it's a CD (poor audio), second it's an old recording yet awful good technically for it's time, and third it is missing a few other of his greatest music. That is why I did not rate it 5 star."
5,WWE taboo tuesday review,I give it a 5/5. Best DVD PPV. The best match was between Randy Orton vs Ric Flair.If you need this to be part of anybody collection you should have it.
4,Live Pig At There Best!,"I had heard that there would be a new blodwyn pig release but at the time did not have any idea what was on this new cd!I bought the cd to check and see if there was anything new to be had here! Well what we have here is a comp.cd of live stuff from three released cds from indigo.Live At Lafayette,Live In Madrid and All Tore Down. The live recordings are from 1974 and 1993.If you do not have any of those cds then this comp would be a good sampler from those three cds.I would suggest getting all three of those cds but,if you want to checkout some great live stuff from mick abrahams and the pig this two cd set is for you. Enjoy!"
5,Chex,just keeps getting better and better all the time. This flavor is excellently put together. It is one of my kids favorite snacks.
5,Pervasive thinking in a hundred years,"Difficult to disagree that religion is pure superstition, that ethics are mostly unrelated to organized religion and that we must take responsibility for our individual actions."
5,Great story!!,I enjoy this story as much as my children do. It is a beautiful story about the importance of mass and a strong faith in God. A must read!
4,Beautiful in its simplicity,I enjoyed sharing this book with our children. The story spoke to them in ways their father and I haven't been able to. Thank you.
5,A Delightful Story,"This, another wonderful present from my godparents, is a delightful ""Tale of Faith"", as the book says on the cover.It concerns an old beggar woman who came into a bakers shop to ask for a crust of bread. In return, she would hear a Mass for him. Through a series of weight-testing, the baker, his son, the woman, and all present learn the true weight of a Mass.Definitely a book you will want to read again and again."
5,Perfect Gift for a Godchild,"I have ordered several copies of this book and given them as gifts, and I will order many more I am sure. It is a terrific First Communion gift, providing a very tangible example of the value of going to Mass, it is a message which resonates with parent and child alike."
4,My daughter likes it.,"I bought this book as a gift of my 6 year old for her birthday. She just started her religious instruction and wants to know what the mass is for. The language is a bit challenging for her, and the concept of the story may be advanced but she liked the story."
4,The best book on Behavioral Safety,Scott teaches the fundamentals that are easy to understand and are illustrated by many relevant examples. Lots of ideas on how to practically apply the theory to improve safety behaviors at work.
3,Brawn not brain,"As a mother I love the ""Magic School Bus"" and am glad that my kids love it too. Science mixed with fun characters is a relief from most brainless cartoons.This entry in the ""Magic School Bus"" series is only okay. Although Ralphie and the other kids have fun building a robot, the episode is supposed to be about the structure of the human body and that part gets a little lost.However, my daughter enjoys it and having Tony Randall as a guest voice is enjoyable."
4,"A Solid, Very Listenable Album","I like this album quite a bit. Most of the songs are catchy, although some are slow and depressing. It's like what you'd get if Bjork and Stereolab collaborated to record the sountrack to ""Lost in Translation."""
