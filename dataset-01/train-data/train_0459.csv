1,wish I saved my $54,"When I first bought this and used it, I thought it would loosen up and not be so stiff over time. I was wrong. It is clumsy and akward and takes too long to open the case. To access flash card or ports or battery, you have unscrew the base of the unit. I suspect the people who designed this were not the people who will be using it. I wish I had purchased a zip bag instead!"
1,Semi-hard case,"I have been taking pictures for quite a long time and use to own different SLR cameras all of them with their own case.They were always made of good leather and the attachment to the camera were good and flexible, one button on the bottom and one on the back, take the one on the back, open it and flipped around and undo the one on the bottom.This one has two buttons on the bottom and VELCRO on top, yes VELCRO for a camera that costs 1,000 usd this is unaceptable, not only that but is very cumbersome to open it, once you are done with the velcro you still have to deal with the buttons on the bottom.The old type you could leave the case hanging if you were taking just one picture and then just pull it up and close it.With this case no can do it is either on or off, nothing in between.I don't think this product is worth buying specially for the Cannon Rebel XT which is very good and expensive.Jorge Sanjines[...]"
4,Good Quality; A Bit Awkward,"Overall, the EH-18L is a very good case for the Canon Rebel XT. It certainly protects the camera well. The only negative is the awkwardness in removing the cover from the camera. It is a bit difficult to pull the camera body from inside the case. That is only a minor inconvenience considering how well the camera is protected."
1,Poor Design,"This case is poorly designed. It is functionally awkward to use. It is difficult to open the case and take pictures. If someone wants to store the camers in a case without everyday usage (which defeats the purpose of having a camera case), it could be good."
1,"Made for film, not digital SLR","Overall, I like the design concept: base that screws onto the camera, and then a case that snaps/velcros on around the rest. On this side of things, it is nice. But the problem is that you can not plug in the usb cable, nor can you pull out the CF card without unscrewing the base. If I was taking hundreds of pictures, and only importing them to the computer once a week the design would be good. For me, unless I'm on vacation, I tend to import the pictures every 50 snaps or so. Taking the base off each time is a real pain. For that hassle, I give it a 1 star. I am keeping it, but only because I don't have the time to hunt down a better case."
2,just a leather box,This is a poorly designed camera case. You have to take the camera out of the case completely each time you shoot pictures. I expected the case to remain on the camera body and just uncover the lens so you can shoot. I was very disappointed. This is rather a leather box than a camera case.
2,Pretty Much Worthless,"This case is very limited in design and function. I see no reason to really own it. Frankly buy the Canon backpack instead (see my other review on it) and when you are out shooting picks, just use the strap around your neck. Your life will much easier."
1,NOT for CANON XTI,This case is useless for Canon XTI. I don't know why camera makers don't make cases for the camera they sell. (XTI won't fit in with or without lens and if you try to push too hard may damage the LCD screen or flash)
1,Broke First Day,one of the snaps broke the first day. Even if I had kept it it seemed to have limited use as it was too cumbersome.
2,"very cumbersome, good protection","This semi-hard case is very cumbersome in terms of handling, at first I couldn't really put the camera in. So, it's quite unusable, otherwise the protection level is good.I wouldn't recommend it. Only if you are masochist :-)."
5,SUPER family game!!,"The tiles are NOT see through---they may have upgraded them. The game is GREAT for the kids. I've got two little ones that love to practice their spelling and my husband and I end up joining them. It's fun, educational and perfect for the whole family. I've very glad I ignored the review saying that they tiles were see through. It's perfect for kids (and grown ups enjoy playing it too!).Very happy I bought it!!"
3,hanged,"I have already submitted a review for the item I purchased. I have indicated the game arrived damaged. Furthermore, I made contact with the distributor about receiving a replacement game console. So far, I have not heard back from them."
2,See Through Tiles,"You can totally see through my tiles. I bought mine a couple of years ago. Model number on box says, 04623. Looks to me like there was a bad batch of them made. When I was younger, I had one that was fine.The game is fun, reasonably priced, and educational for the kids as well.I like it because it doesn't take long to play, and several people can all get a turn within an hour.I have written to Hasbro regarding the tiles. Not sure why I waited 2 years to do so, but hopefully they will make good on this problem."
1,waste of money,The tiles are transparent. There is absolutely no guessing the word your opponent has chosen because you can see right through the tiles. I took masking tape and put several layers over the back of the tile and I could still see through it. I colored it with a permanent marker and could STILL see through it. My mom can play with my daughter in her basement but that is about it!! Would not recommend this item to anyone unless you have money to throw away.
4,Great for phone transportation on bike,Love this for carrying my iphone on the bike. Velcro could be a little better. Seems to loose its ability to fasten together after repeated use.
2,internet retread,"all this same info is available on the internet but I guess if you dont have good access to the net then this could be helpful, I was disappointed"
4,"Classic Film, No Extras on Blu-Ray","The film is a cult classic and the sound quality is the major improvement on Blu-ray as compared with earlier versions.You simply don't find pacing in an action film as good as this dystopic film and it is truly one of Carpenter's best, really capturing the political pessimism of the eighties.Unfortunately, there are no extras. I would have liked the inclusion of the commentary and the deleted train heist scene. I thought it was a great contrast to the darkness of the rest of the film. These can only be found on certian previous DVD (and VHS) editions."
4,an interesting futuristic action movie from the past,"It's a good movie. A nice suspense, a good intigue and a lot of action in a surreal atmosphere. It also shows some interesting pieces of high technology from the 1980's (like pumpkin-size walkie-talkies), or from the science-fiction of the time (micro biological implant bombs). Snake Plisken is an interesting character, well played by Kurt Russel."
2,"Great premise and lead performance, that's about it.","Futuristic sci-fi actioner details an attempt to break into New York City, now a gigantic prison, to get the United States president out. The film gets a boost from such an intriguing premise and a highly enjoyable performance from Kurt Russell, but the action scenes completely lack in energy, lots of potential is wasted, and New York looks pretty much like any other urban neighborhood. I'm a fan of John Carpenter, but I can't defend his work here. Followed by a fairly ridiculous but enjoyable sequel."
1,Great fun movie.... but the DVD ruins it.,"Ok this movie was good but the DVD is simply not worth getting. Paramount has major issues with DVD's. I dont think they like them becuase hardly any Paramount movies have special features. All this has is a trailer. But that should'nt count as a special feature becuase every DVD has a trailer. They didnt even bother to add production notes or cast/crew biograhpies. I hope that Paramount can one day set aside they're DVD issues and make a a jammed packed DVD like Gladiator or something. Oh, if you do buy this movie dont bother getting Escape From L.A. beucase you will just be paying for the same movie twice as they are both the same movie."
3,original,"would this b the origin of the legend of the one eyed trousered snake?as a plus u get the caddy with chandelliers as headlights,how's that for goth?either file under irrelevant or just wallow in it."
4,Very Good...But,"As a devoted DVD collector, I was anxious to get the Special Edition Escape from New York but I was disappointed about one thing - John Carpenter stated that before its release, he was going to add in the original opening sequence where Snake and Fresno Bob rob the Federal Reserve Depository and get caught on the subway. He even stated that he scored music for the scene and included it in the film but it does not appear in the feature film. It appears on Disc Two's Special Features. Misled but still a Plissken/Carpenter fan."
4,The Future Is...Eight Years Ago,"This is one of the better efforts from director John Carpenter. There is a dynamite premise here and he sets it up well. The sets showing the decay setting in on Manhattan is excellent. Kurt Russell contributes a memorable anti-hero in Snake Plissken, former special-forces commando gone bad. Lee Van Cleef as the hard boiled warden Hauck has not skipped a beat from when he was making spaghetti westerns with Sergio Leone. Ernest Borgnine offers good comic relief as Cabbie. Carpenter even composed a decent score for the film. If I am to find fault with the film is that it is just a little too much style over substance for me to give it an unqualified rave. As the film's nominal heavy, Isaac Hayes may have the look but not the acting heft to pull it off. In conclusion, ""Escape from New York"" entertained me but didn't overwhelm me."
5,This film is one of the best and should be seen by everyone.,"No other film can match this one's perfection. It's flawless. It is a realistic look at where the world seems to be heading right now. While the movie only had a small budget of 1 million dollars to work with, the acting and scenery is top-notch. The sets really convey a city which has been abandoned and left desolate only to be turned into a maximum security prison. The special effects aren't really all that flashy, but this is because of three reasons: 1) it was made in 1981 2) it had a small budget 3) it's a movie set in a prison. How are there supposed to be flasy explosions and such in a prison? All in all the movie does have a high degree of realism and leaves the viewer thinking of how easily this movie could happen in real life. END"
3,a good old time,"John Carpenter directs Kurt Russell in another one of his movies..this time, Russell plays Snak Plissken..a outlaw man who is sent to New York because air force one was taken hostage and then the presidents escape pod landed in the city..so Russell is sent in with a glyder(not much fun special effects..though its an 80's action movie) and he has hours till he finds the kidnapped president(Donald Pleasence)0 who is under hostage by Isaac Hayes..so Russell zips threw the city dodging every corner and turn with some help from Brain(Harry Dean Stanton), Cabby(Ernest Borgnine) and many others...some characters down it but the chase scene at the end is great"
1,Disapointing,"I bought this movie because everyone said it was good and better than the second Part (Escape from L.A.). Well all I can say is that its just stupid...The story may be ok but the acting and atmospehre (if it even exists) is just like soem schoolplay of Hamlet.On top of that it does hardly have any action. There is only 1 scene of ""action"": (spoilers) Snake gets chased by some crazy people (?) ,runs into a building and covers up the window he jumped in, than he takes out his Mac11 (with scope on thesupresor -_-) and shoots one guys Hand of wich leaves a bloody mess.Im sorry to say but if you have seen Escape from LA first than dont watch this..."
1,Poor,"I just saw this film for the first time. I have heard it was pretty good, but certainly don`t agree with that. Too littleaction. I think the film also was too slow. Carpenter could have trimmed 5-10 minutes of scenes. I didn`t care forthe story either. I will not see this again. I regret i bought it. The sequel that i also bought, is probably also lousy.Very disappointing.Picture Quality: 3.5/5This was a very dark film, so not very many scenes that looks detailed and sharp. It could have been restoredbetter. I think they should have turned up the brightness a bit, so we could see things clearer. It`s too dark.Audio Quality: 3.5/5I was not so impressed by the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. I think most of the gunfire effects could have had moreclarity and bass. I think this audio track could have been remixed better.Film: 1/5Overall: 1/5"
1,Looks absolutely dreadful,"Read the reviews at amazon.co.uk. It is upscaled standard definition. It looks like garbage. Don't waste your money, just wait for the official US release which will hopefully be better."
4,Escape from NY,This is a good adventure film. It maintains a nice quick pace. Kurt Russell is surrounded by some superb support actors and actresses with a fine script and good direction. It's not science fiction like Blade Runner or Alien. It's better than fair but short of an excellent adventure film.
3,where are the BONUS features on the BLU RAY Version?,"Hi folks,I love this 5 star movie....make no mistake, its an all time favorite. I was thrilled to get the 2 disc edition with bonus opening, commentary, making of and more...but imagine my surprise when I find that this new Blu RAY is bare bones!!! Maybe it has something to do with Fox taking over the MGM catalog? I don't know..but I'm tired of these bare bones Blu Rays which make keeping older DVD versions mandatory for fans... just a rip off.I obviously bought the Blu Ray...maybe hoping the description was wrong and there would be the bonus content or maybe because I'm a mark for this film...but either way it arrived...sure it looks a wee bit better than the deluxe edition...but zip bonus features..unless a bare bones DVD with a full frame option excites you?"
2,NO FRILLS BLU-RAY OF OK CULT FILM,"Snake Plissken is still in business in this cult fave from 1981. Kurt Russell's over-the-top turn as outlaw and former Special Forces war hero sent him into the brutal, converted prison of Manhattan to rescue the President from a plane crash. Oh, and Plissken has a bomb in his gut set to go off in 24 hours if his mission fails. You know the drill by now. By the numbers and from the mind of John Carpenter. A no frills Blu-ray edition. Where are the extras? How come no commentary from Carpenter and Russell? Not enough bucks to make 'em talk?"
4,"enter the ""snake""","i saw this when it first came out and it still is one of the best action films of the 80's. kurt russell and john charptner are the john wayne and john ford of their generation. there isn't a false note in this fast and fun action movie. just enjoy the fun and fantasy of a pre 9/11 future new york and as they say of the ""duke"" this film ""is a number one , the tops"" . it also has one of lee van cleef's last proformances. he truley was one of the most underrated actors in film history. enjoy it and call him ""snake"""
5,Escape From New York,"Very good transfer. Overall, a vast improvement in PQ and AQ over the dvd release. It did appear to me that the picture was brighter than the previous releases, but it doesn't detract too much from the movie. I dialed in the brightness and contrast to replicate the murkiness of the dvd release and went from there."
4,DA DUKE OF NEW YORK!!!!!!!!,"WHAT A GREAT CULT CLASSIC,JOHN CARPENTER MADE A ENTERTAINING ACTION FLICK,EVERY ACTOR ROCKED IN THIS ONE! THIS IS ONE IS A KEEPER IN YOUR DVD COLLECTION.......OFTEN IMITATED,NEVER DUPLICATED..TIMELESS"
4,Consider Me Sheltered,"Consider me sheltered, but I only recently saw Escape from New York, and perhaps the dated feeling is the reason why I gave it four stars rather than five. It's an apocolypse tale based in the year 1997, a year far gone already, in which New York has become the world's penal colony and where the President of the United States has crashed landed. The hero, Snake, must go in and save him or die. Obviously, he chooses to save the president and goes.That's most of the story. What follows is countless scenes of action. The action is well-done and convincing if a little dated. Though I'm sure at the time of the original filming Snake was unique, he's now the common anti-hero character that dominates most Hollywood action films today. I'd recommend this movie for anyone who loves decent action flicks, cult films, or are John Carpenter Fans."
3,Escape From New York (Special Edition),"The transfer is actually pretty good. The movie itself is quite dated but entertaining especially if are a comic book fan. If you loved the movie the first time by all means buy it. If you like Kurt Russell, have not seen the movie, are not really a comic book fan, and can't really imagine Kurt in a dark role, it may not be a film that trips your trigger. It really didn't work for me."
4,Escape From New York,"If you like action, this is your movie. Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken (said to be the character Solid Snake from the Metal Gear video game series was named after).Don't want to get too much into the plot but any movie where someone is armed with a mac-10 (might be an uzi) with an extended barrel and a scope has got to be a good action movie, and it is."
4,Escape from you wallet,Escape from your wallet? Well thats exactly what your cash should be doing right now! It's taken so long for die hard fans to finaly get to see the Bank Robbery sequence that is included on this disc. I already owned the first DVD release of this title and when you compare the two together the transfer is so much better and the sound is great. There is a comic included which is roughly the same size as the one included in the special edition of spider man. If you have also played the first Metal Gear Solid on the PS one you will notice that the start of the first game has the same elevator squence has the bank robbery. This film deserves all the attention it gets.Get it Snake Bites!
4,Great film...but wait for the serious DVD release TBA soon.,"The transfer here is great. Carpenter's movies are often copied, but nobody can make a low budget movie look as good as Carpenter and usual co-horts Tommy Lee Wallace and Dean Cundy.If you just want the film, get this, but if you want the film, a commentary track with Carpenter and Russell, and a whole bunch of extras, wait for the special edition to be released later this month. This film deserves a special edition release."
5,A plausible Sci-fi story,"Even though I purchased the DVD, whenever this movie comes on TV I have to watch it. I really like Kirk Russell as Snake. He's defiant and supported by a great group of actors like Harry Dean Stanton, Donald Pleasance, Adrienne Barbeau, Ernest Borgnine, Lee Van Cleef, and Tom Atkins. Its not a block buster story but it sure keeps my interest. And I love the twist at the end."
4,A Look into Colonial America,"Forced to flee France, young Daniel's Huguenot family finds itself on the Lily, a ship transporting cargo to Africa. Daniel is shocked to find that in Africa, the cargo they've been carrying is replaced by live cargo - captured slaves. He is faced with the horrific truth of slavery and the brutal conditions in which these slaves are transported. He befriends one of the captured girls, and their friendship continues throughout the story.Though fictionalized, this story includes real details about the slave trade and the founding of the New Rochelle communty in the colony of New York. Readers will gain an understanding of the hardships of life in colonial America, the difficulties of language barriers that immigrants faced, and the the moral complexities of slavery. This book would be a good addition to a classroom study or homeschool unit on colonial America.Kris Bordessa, author of Great Colonial America Projects You Can Build Yourself"
4,Good Album,If you really enjoy Peggy Scott-Adams then you definitely will enjoy this one. I like the album.
3,Could Be Better,"Not as good as her previous albums, here her vocals shine through and take centre stage. Some of the songs are not very memorable and are tepid. The best tracks are ""That's How I Do It"", ""That Ok With Me"", ""Mommy's No Dummy"", ""Let the Door Hit Ya!"", and ""Your Too Freaky for Me"". Over repeat listening the songs grow on you more. Not bad but not great."
3,Not as good as initial hyped reviews,"I bought this cd after reading the gushing initial reviews. No matter how many times I play it, it just doesn't click. I agree with the reviewer who said it's like demo Asia or GTR. It feels a bit underproduced. And the supposed huge contribution of keyboardist Geoff Downes? Well, to my ears, apart from a few short solos, his contribution is strictly Gregg Allmanesque window dressing. Indeed, you can tell he came late into the White universe, since he also didn't have a hand in any of the songwriting.The vocalist, at times, sounds remarkably like Peter Gabriel, circa 1974. There's plenty of guitarwork but, again, no matter how often I listen, it just doesn't impress. Too bad; I was excited about this album and really wanted to like it. Not that White is a bad recording; it just isn't great (to my ears)."
3,Start over with a new lead vocalist,"Sorry to say, but Kevin Currie's voice ruined what could have been an impressive springboard for Alan. Geoff Downes rescues what he can and the overall harmonies show promise but Kevin should never have been allowed to record lead vocals on this CD until his voice healed. More than 20 percent of his upper vocal range was clipped. His voice wasn't raspy as much as damaged and it brought up genuine revulsion in me as a listener/fan pre-disposed to support the project.Back to the drawing board guys. And rest up!"
2,Well what's all the fuss about it? Ok it's not a prog album...,"Well what's all the fuss about it? Ok it's not a prog album, but rather better labelled as AOR music or mainstream, sometimes in the vein of B. Adams. The unique exception could have been represented by the track#9 ""Loyal"" or a few melodic moments, but the singer is not able to emulate this kind of ""Gabrielesque"" vocalism; or you could have also appreciated a different style, emulating the modern Yes band of the ""Modern Rabin Era"" within the first two tracks, but then you can stay listening to it and you are disappointed at the end...the good intoduction inside ""Waterhole"" is not enough to recommend the present album, as the role of G. Downes at the keyboards is not remarkable here and the approach by the veteran drummer A. White is not equal to his performance with the old Yes!!So I'm not enthusiastic about it, but make your own choice as usual!"
4,"Yes, This Is A Solid Project","The 2006 release is a collaborative project by drummer Alan White, who enlists Geoff Downes (key), Steve Boyce (b), Karl Haug (g) and Kevin Currie (v).Currie has a similar lyrical presentation as Peter Gabriel, but his personal style shines on the majestic Dream Away, reaching out in Loyal and the rolling of the dice in the oftentimes vicious game of life that is found in Waterhole. New Day is a solid musical piece, with the powerful Once And For All a foundation to the album. The cover art is a classic landscape from Roger Dean.The majority of the 10 songs were written for several projects that featured the band members - minus Downes - and other musicians; including the group, Merkaba, and an abandoned album project entitled, Loyal. While the numbers have textures of progressive rock, there are plenty of punchy guitar riffs that gives the album a classic feel of FM radio."
5,Great Riddle Fun for the Youngest Humorists,"Children love to laugh, but it's hard to find riddles and jokes that are 1. funny and 2. appropriate for them. This collection of silly rhymes is right on target. Buy a copy for your preschool through second grade child and watch her wear it out as she shares it with all of her friends."
4,Nice and easy to handle,"I just received my MC-i250. The setup was very easy with my WLAN router using the 128-bit WEP encryption key and SSID. The unit immediately connected to my network and downloaded the firmware upgrade. I had some trouble receiving the registration email, but that was just because my email server filtered it out as spam. Once registered, I could enter my personal radio stations on the WEB and update the time setting via the Internet. The unit connected and played the stations properly. Sound quality is excellent, especially the wOOx bass enhancement feature is a great experience.The only unfortunate thing is that the CD player in the unit I received is broken. I called Philips customer service who suggested to return the unit rather than repair it. Very courteous and fast response though. I will now see how well the replacement procedure works.Overall, I can recommend this item."
1,Zero stars,"I was completely flummoxed by this complicated product with an absolutely impenetrable instruction manual. I have 3 college degrees, I consider myself computer literate, but this was beyond my imagination. Simple instructions were nowhere to be found. During the set up, the screen said to choose one of two options, I knew which one I wanted but I could not find out how to make the selection. The instructions for making selections must be far separated from the actual tasks described - I could not find it. This product is made in China and I believe the instruction manual was written there also. Avoid this one like the Chinese plague."
4,Things you should know,"There are definitely things you should know about this workbook before you purchase it. First, the most recent copyright is 1952. Second, it is directed to High School age. Third, it is meant for group study.Ms. Walker knew her bible, and includes lots of useful background information. She asks good questions. She keeps the lessons moving along. I found this workbook useful and informative."
1,ordered/sent wrong book.,"I tried to order the Gerald Malsbary translation. Because the entry lacked information, I mistook this Dru translation for a Malsbary."
5,"Leisure, Contemplation, and Culture","The excellent Malsbury translation of Pieper's famous work brings together many of the themes found in other works of the author. For instance, leisure or stillness, is not to be thought of as leisure in the contemporary sense. Leisure is to be thought of in a framework of an teleology which is a contemplation of ends, or last things. Since man is made for union with God, human work is not seperate from this end. Today, the work of man is an end in itself, and philsophical anthropology and culture suffers. Pieper shows how this is a reorientation from the classical and scholastic world view which shared a common vision of anthropology as man seeking those things which are above. This book is a must read for all those who think modern culture is suffering from an identity crisis."
1,"No range, hard to use, and broke","Range: In a suburban setting - no tall buildings, 0.3 mile - honestly I could almost shout that distance. On ski slopes it was ok.Use: The push to talk (PTT) button was very stiff and both I and my wife had problems holding it down.Broke: PTT button broke the 4th day we had it - just as well. I'll go GMRS next time - different brand too."
5,"the nightmare, the dream","""War in the Blood"" is my favorite Asia book of recent years. It is still the definitive work on Southeast Asia's HIV/AIDS epidemic; but it is also a beautifully wrought travel memoir, written by a compassionate & intelligent observer. I have recommended it to many people interested in Burma. It also would be a fine clear-eyed introduction to contemporary Southeast Asian culture in all of its contradictions and surprises. ""War in the Blood"" is by no means a depressing work of epidemiology; rather it is a call to action, and in that sense, a ray of hope."
2,Rambling Combination of Facts on HIV and Southeast Asia,"I was genuinely disappointed by this book given the interesting subject matter and the review posted on Amazon. Beyrer often loses his focus, shifting from discussing the AID epidemic to devoting entire paragraphs to an examination of Thai architecture and the temples of Chiang Mai. I applaud his effort to try to interweave cultural themes, but unfortunately this book reads like a travel guide loosely tied together. While there are some good insights and facts, it seems Beyrer's editors provided him poor guidance to focus his writing."
4,Slow Lane Is Still A Good Ride,"Beware! Amazon review is almost a spoiler for this book -- and not meticulously accurate. The mini-series proceeds with the characters from The Light Years, all nestled into The Home Place to wait out the war. The interaction of the Cazalet generations and the lives of the servants is conscientiously portrayed in the most realistic manner. Social commentary is enlightening and the reader receives a eidetic view of the times."
2,shipping of the product,"Muscle milk is a very good product that is very healthy for the individual that is drinking it! It's everything that the product maker of Muscle milk say's it is. We drink Muscle milk by the 14oz, 17oz or 20oz container at least once a day. But you have to watch the way they ship it to you. We had out of the case of 12-17oz containers of liquid muscle milk three broken containers and one that was spoiled but we did received 8-17oz in the case that were up to our expectations. Way to go Muscle mlk"
1,Absolutely Horrible!,I stopped by a convenience store today and picked up a bottle of this Banana Creme Muscle Milk because I was out of my usual morning protein drink at home. This is one of the worst things I have ever tasted in my entire life! Seriously tastes like they bottled monkey vomit! Three sips and I threw it in the trash. Total waste of money! Do not buy!
1,NOT Ready-To-Drink,Let me start by saying that Muscle Milk is a fantastic supplement and I highly endorse it. But this gets one-star from me because it is sold as a Ready-To-Drink product which has not consistently met that claim. I have ordered several cases via the subscribe and save from Amazon. Each and every box had more than half of the tops off or damaged beyond use. The last box that arrived only had TWO drinks with the tops in tact. The tops serve two purposes: They allow for easy opening and obviously make for easy drinking. Without the tops you have to puncture the opening as well as an additional hole in the back to get the drink out. This is messy and a down-right disappointment.
5,Great quick protein shake.,"In a quick pinch and in need of fuel, this is a great protein shake to drink on the run!"
4,good stuff in a tetrapak,I've been using this product for a few months; I can honesly say that it's one of the products of its kind that I have found that works.
1,"Fantasy, Not Fact","This is my first review without reading the book, but I felt compelled to comment. Many people who have written reviews here take this account as a ""true"" story . . . or is it??? Anyone who has studied Irish folklore (as I have) knows that leprechauns are SOLITARY faeries (they live by themselves in secluded places), EXCLUSIVELY masculine, and are far from friendly to any hapless mortal who crosses their path. Does the author confuse those nasty leprechauns with the more amenable Sidhe? I'm not going to bother reading the book to find out. I'll just continue looking for a more well-researched volume that does not target gullible readers."
4,Be open-minded and learn something new,"I have always felt a kinship with Ireland and its people and I was sure that there must be leprechauns out there, and now I think it is a possibility. If even you are skeptical, the book is fun and interesting and describes a ""wee bit o'Ireland"" that is intriguing."
4,1985 was 23 years ago ...,"I met Tanis recently at a writers festival in Powell River and I was immediately drawn to read this book, and I am glad I did. Though some might scoff, I think her descriptions portray real events that took place in the astral interface. For example, I have never heard of anyone having a bath with a leprechaun before ...I think if you are interested in elementals or astral beings and their interactions with humanity, you should read this book.And for those of you who might think that this is nothing more than a work of imagination, you might also want to consider the role of the imagination as a bridge, rather than as an escape from what you think is reality.Highly recommended."
2,Questionable story...,"I just couldn't believe her story. I do believe in nature spirits and such. Her story sounds much like ""faerie fiction"" you read with a little sprinkle of fundamental truths of nature consciousness thrown in. There are much better books dealing with devas and nature consciousness out there. If the story is really true, she may have had an enlightening experience with nature consciousness but it is heavily tarnished with her own bias, beliefs, prejudices, etc.. so that the story sounds untrue. There are better books out there. Try Penny Kelly's, ""The Elves of Lily Hill Farm"" or one by Machaelle S. Wright."
4,Leaping Leprechauns,"A friend of ours...dear lovers of faery lore,... met Tanis Helliwell at one of her seminars and really liked her. As to this book, while we think it reads a little slowly, nonetheless we found it to be an interesting, and in many ways insightful book, that tells of the author's summer in Ireland during which a Leprechaun frequently appeared to her at the house she was renting where they carried on a series of conversations on metaphysical subjects related to the Earth and the fair folk. If you like this book you may also find Matthew'sThe Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworldinteresting as well.kyela,the silver elves"
5,This book is a fine read!,"It is an easy and good read and I consider it sort of a spiritual textbook. I found knowledge in it that goes back to my old metaphysical days. I checked out the writer on the web and she does have a website and is continuing to spread the word of her ""Summer with the Leprechauns."""
2,I just couldn't believe.,"This is fun if you read it with the attitude that it is a work of fiction. The author gives wonderfully vivid descriptions of Ireland and her people. Unfortunately, there were many times I found myself wondering if there was anyone out there who actually believed her story.If you're interested in a visitor's view of a quiet vacation in a small Irish town, this would be a good book to read. If you're looking for information about working with nature spirits and elementals like I was, save your money. This is more like her personal journal, not a practical guide to the wee folk."
1,Summer with the Leprechauns: A True Story,I was amazed when I received the book. It looked strange and I realized that the top partand the bottom part of the book had been cut off. The book is like new and has never been usedhowever it's obvious that it is a misprint and I'm not really happy about this odd appearance.
2,this book is extremly borring exept of the last 5 chapters,this books keeps giving more and more unnececary information to a point where i was ready to give up the book. when the plot starts to roll it`s a good book! but to read 17 chapters -\+ for a good 5 it doesnt worth it . keep it to a really desperet times!!
5,Kazaganthi: The Minotaur Hero,"The third adventure of the minotaur warrior Kazaganthi De Orlig, who first came about in the classic ""Legend of Huma"" and whose story continued in ""Kaz the Minotaur"". Kaz has established a minotaur community that stands for freedom from the Circle (The Minotaur Government) and The Sons of Sargas (The High Clerics) much to their chagrin. When Kaz's Brother-in-law goes missing in the capital of the minotaur empire he embarks on a search and rescue mission that is more successful than he ever wanted. Accompanied by his kender companion and a strange human child, Kaz faces challenges that could decide the fate of the entire minotaur race. This story is an even further in-depth look at the society and culture of a usually forgotten but extremely interesting race and one of the best characters in the entire DragonLance world. It isn't necessary to have read the previous two books to enjoy this one but I highly recommend it."
5,"A mix of Burt Bacharach, 5th Dimension, Petula Clark","As close to a perfect album as I've ever heard. A picture of what pop music might be like if rock were just one influence, instead of the dominant one. Lead singer Corinne Drewery has a voice similar to an alto Petula Clark."
3,"A letdown from ""...its better to travel""","I like this album, but I don't listen to it often. I had great expectations after hearing their first disc, and I was disappointed. The problem: their drummer, the third in the trio from IBTT, was gone, replaced sporadically by a drum machine. It just wasn't the same."
2,"Old idea, poorly written","The premise of this book is certainly nothing new, and the writing itself is nothing to write home about. Benford spends a large number of pages telling very little story, with numerous uninteresting side-trips and distractions. He also frequently switches between present tense and past tense randomly, and engages in long run-on sentences with no punctuation or capitalization - this must be considered ""cool"" in some writing circles, but as a reader, it is a great annoyance. I certainly won't be bothering with any more in this series."
3,Okay SciFi.,"Nothing real special in this science fiction story, nothing unusual, nothing real exciting. But I did enjoy the read."
1,Better Physics than writing SciFi!,"I really fail to see what all the hype is about this very boring book. It is a long, boring collection of misconnected thoughts. Since they are misconnected they never come together.What is the final resolution of Alexandria being resurrected? That is never developed.What is the point of the ""new sons""? It is just an incidental group that comes and goes through out this endless barage of ramblings.In my estimation, Gregory Benford should stay with teaching Physics, which I hope he does better than attempting to write SciFi!Get a grip folks. There are reviewers that will aclaim ANYTHING!I finally put this rag where it belongs...in the trash."
3,Good and Bad Techno Pop,"Released in 1996, this a techno pop remix album. It has 7 tracks and is about 40 minutes long. The sound quality is good but not excellent.At the time of this album, Poi Dog Pondering was a large group that sounded similar to Rusted Root. This album is a complete departure from that sound.Some of the tracks were would sound dated when this thing was released. They are the basic rhythm heavy, highly repetitive tape loops. These was the kind of music that was played in disco clubs, with lights flashing, in the late 1980s. It is not the kind of Techno Pop that U2 was trying to make in the album Pop. I really don't like these tracks. To me they are just pulsating noise and give me a headache. I really did not think they were good to dance to either.Four of the tracks on this CD are very good. Especially good is god's gallipoli, which exudes sexual energy.Anyway, with this CD, you get 4 great tracks and 28 minutes of good music."
4,Will The Real Fanny Brice Please Stand Up?,"This is a satisfying,well reasearched, and enlightening look into the real truths behind famed comic and Ziegfield star Fanny Brice. With harsh facts yet obvious respect for her subject author Barbara W. Grossman peels away the myths propagated by the Streisand films and gets to the facts and the core of the real Fanny Brice. This is a very entertaining biography and may also be used as a great tool to research the early days of Vaudeville, Burlesque, and the Ziegfield Follies."
3,misinterpretation,"Bought this disc from Amazon.co.uk. Queffelec is a wonderful player, and the sound quality is outstanding. But Queffelec interprets Satie's music as though he were a Romantic composer. Very awkward and jarring to listen to, an unwelcome imposition. Melodramatic and heavy handed without the surreal pathos and whimsical humor. Stick with de Leeuwen's stunning slow and graceful performances or Ciccolini's insightful and sympathetic renditions."
3,Revell has done better,"This isn't bad to listen to, but Graeme Revell has done better. His best work has to be The Crow and The Crow: City of Angels. Another thing that works against this cd is the length. We can't blame Revell for this, but this is typical of Sarabande records. If they are going to compete in this market they need to give more."
1,"no kyle, no plot, no thanks!","he first ten minutes of this film are great ... but most people who are watching this sequel will quickly notice that it's just footage from the first film which starred Kyle MacLachlan.Kyle's character, a good alien, kills off one of the bad aliens but not before it spawns. Time passes and another good alien teams up with the daughter of the star from the first flic.What results is a film with little intrigue and no new concepts. They could have provided more insights into the alien races or maybe showcased some cooler alien powers or forms. The anticlamatic ending will leave many wondering why?"
2,HIDDEN 2 INFERIOR SEQUEL,"Under Jack Sholder's direction and the acting talents of Kyle McLachlan and Michael Nouri, the original HIDDEN remains one of the best scifi films of recent times. This lame sequel doesn't have Sholder, McLachlan and Nouri. Instead we get Raphael Sbarge as the alien cop, Kate Hodge as Nouri's daughter and inept direction from writer/director Seth Pinsker. Pinsker keeps most of the movie so poorly lit, it's hard to tell at times what is going on, and after the exciting finale of the original, Pinsker's climax is boring and unexciting. Shame Sholder wasn't hired to do the sequel...this one's way below par."
2,You will not receive the classic version - Bravofun is shiping the new version at a premium price,"Just so you know before you buy - the pictures may show the classic version, the feedback may relate to the classic version, but seller Bravofun does not ship the classic version - they ship the newest version, with ""5 ways to play"", at a higher price than you can buy it from other sellers on this site."
1,BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE BUYING!,"I had this game back in 1978, when it was a big 16.25 inches wide. The box I got today was about 9 x 9 inches square. Milton Bradley has severely downsized this game and it looks much less structurally sound than the game I remember. The game may still be fun to play, but the picture and size description here on Amazon do not give an accurate representation of the game being delivered. Shame on Milton Bradley for the weak new version and shame on Amazon for failing to update its image. I will return this and find one second-hand. I want the original, big, sturdy version again."
4,"classic game, but less durable than in the past","connect four is a classic strategy game for kids - i grew up loving this game. but it's more poorly made than the sets i used as a kid. thinner, lighter weight plastic. it'll last, but you'll definitely need to be gentle with it."
5,love it,"I bought this for my 5 year old nephew. I loved this toy as a child and thought this would be something fun for my nephew to play with. He is also just learning checkers and chess. While he hasn't gotten all the strategy down (plan ahead, think about what your competitior will do next) but it was very fun to play for him, and he seemed to be understanding the need to look at the entire board before you play.I played like I would with anyone (although stopped him some times to think about his moves) but in about 25 games he really won on his own 5 games. Kept us occuppied for hours, and now is playing with his parents.I played this all the time with my sisters and always enjoyed it."
4,connect four,"I haven't opened it yet, but having purchased one before I know the students like it. However, they need to be made a little more sturdy, for rough boys and girls."
2,Way over priced for such cheap build quality.,"This game is a fun and quick game for two, but I would only value this game at less than $10. The construction is too cheap and flimsy. The two supporting (blue) sides have holes to slide and attach to plastic tabs on the yellow game board. The tabs break easily and then the game is no longer usable. It would also be good to have extra game pieces included as some may be lost. To replace mine which had lost several game pieces and now has broken tabs, I am looking for a cheaper alternative or, even better, one that is built better."
1,What arrived was not what was pictured.,"Despite the big price tag, I ordered this game because it was the original game I remember playing as a child. $28 is pricey for a board game but everything old is new again and it's the original vs. the new and improved that I wanted to gift to my niece and nephew. Unfortunately that is not what I received. I was sent the Connect Four with 5 ways to play.To add insult to injury, the game that I did receive costs less in a different Amazon listing (http://www.amazon.com/Connect-4-Five-Ways-Play/dp/B003IT7AK8/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1356126875&sr;=8-4&keywords;=connect+four).I also noticed that the description for the game says the seller is ""Time to SAVE"" and fullfilled by Amazon but the actual seller is ""Goodwin Goodies"" as per my account:past purchases page.The game I'm sure is fine. It's the incorrect listing and price that I am reviewing. Hopefully this review will save the next person from disappointment."
5,A Good Classic Game,"My mother loved to play Connect Four with her grandchildren. It was a way for her to teach them from a young age to count four items; to sort two colors; to learn to look horizontally, vertically, and diagonally; and to win and lose politely. After she lost her ability to think fast and move her hands with dexterity, we could stimulate her by playing a game. We always had a good time with Connect Four.The game is amusing enough to entertain an adult while giving children a quick little fun time. This game has been around a long time, and it continues to be one of the best. I wish that the grid support were stronger. I watched my mother wear out several games.As long as laughter requires no carbon credits, this game is good green entertainment. It burns no fuel."
5,basically a good game,"It's a good game, easy to set-up, easy to learn and it takes some planning and concentration. For the money, it's a great buy."
4,Four In A Row,"There are often times that the classics times we had and we still have with our parents never goes away. That is also said with some of the most classic board games like Connect Four. The game is fun and filled with skill. The object of the game is very simple, you have to try to make four in a row across, vertically, or in a diagnally row. The game is fun and challenging for all ages. Although many people might think that this ios a baby game, where there are more challenging games out there, but it still is a lot of fun to play, and I still love playing this game. It is a great buy.Price: BFun & Convience: B+ with somebody; D+ if you're playing it aloneOverall: B"
5,More Challenging Than It Appears,"On first try Connect Four is a rather simple to the point game, but ultimately it depends upon your opponent. I know for a fact we used to have Connect Four-a-thon's that would last all night long. You are sitting there trying to outwit your opponent and make them fall into a trap and they are trying to do the same thing to you. When it really gets going it's quite engaging. I think that is this games greatest strength, it forces you to think on the fly.Durability-wise for a plastic toy it holds up really well. There have been some Connect Four games that people have had for 10 or 15 years. I think this will be one of the few things still surviving 5,000 years from now along with the cockroaches.This is a simple toy in some respects yes, but still one of my favorites after all these years."
4,Lotus and WebSphere,"This is a great book for anyone to bridge the gap between Lotus and Websphere technologies. Well written, introduces and details topics nicely and is very up to date.Written from developers pov but Admins would also like the book.May be some talks about Wireless technogies - email, PIM and calendar (WebSphere Everyplace Access) would have given some more coverage to the book. Overall book is excellent read."
1,it lasted less than a year,I had my palm for 2yrs but only had it activated for about 3 months I would not recomend this product to anyone.I liked it when it worked but the durability is horrible.I had my palm stored in the box it came in for about one and half years.When I wanted to use it agian it will not work and palm wants to charge $125 to replace. I wouldnt give them $125 for something that has let me down the way this machine has. I paid almost $400 for it and used it for 3 months
1,don't trust it to not crash before your next hotsync,"I have been using this for years and have found that I can never trust it to keep any new info. Taking it on the road and relying on it to not crash is prohibitivly risky. I stripped out all 3rd party software including avant go and only use the bare basic calendar, phonelist and notes and still find it crashes WAY too frequently, needing a reset that wipes out everything in its memory untill my next hot sync. Much as I like the functionality that it was designed for, I'm sick of this piece of crap and am searching hard for a reliable PDA.Hey Palm! How about making a PDA that is reliable and comes with good free tech support for two years (i.e. try not to put your customers on hold forever or charge them excessive fees to fix your unreliable equipment). If any of your competitors do it first I have plenty of money to throw down.nuff said,grrrrrrrrr"
4,A great color PDA w/ Palm OS,"Upgraded from a Handspring Visor Edge to the m515. After doing the research I decided to stick with the Palm OS but change brands for a number of reasons. (1) The m515 comes with the full version of Datviz Documents to Go (not premium version which you can upgrade to) which you will need if you want to make your Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files portable; (2) I wanted a color screen but did not want to spend over $250. I wish the screen was high res (320 x 320 pixels) but I can live without that. Some of the Pocket PC models have great high res screens but I am not convinced that their synchronization abilities are as seamless as Palm's; (3) It is a piece of art in itself combining form and function.I bought the extended warranty from Palm for $40 since there seems to be some design issues with this model."
3,listing of applications is important ...,I was disappointed that I wasn't informed that the palm pilot was a 2002 edition and wouldn't hotsync with the new windows 7!I ended up returning it because it wouldn't work for me because I definitely needed that hotsync application.I will check for those applications I need before I purchase a different one.PalmOne m515 Color Handheld
2,Totally Unreliable!,"I have owned 3 of these beauties within the past 6 months...they work great for a while, then I hotsync it and the Palm freezes up...All the info is erased and the Palm never comes back up/on-line...So, I have sent mine in and received a new one...same exact problem...took it back to Circuit City, got a new one...same exact problem...finally traded it in at Circuit City for the Sony Clie PEG-T665...same exact price, MP3 player...Have not had a problem with it yet and I have had it for 3 months (looking around for some wood to knock on...)"
1,Hot Sync Problems on 2 Units,"I loved my Palm m505 but it started failing to hot sync after less than a year. The Tech Support people were very polite and responsive but none of their suggestions helped. My husband's m515 failed to hot sync after only 6 months. (We use different desktops so it's not a problem with one individual computer.) For us, [$$$] or so is a lot of money to pay for an electronic device that works for less than a year. I will never buy another Palm product. Which is too bad, because I love the way their products work, when they work."
1,Beware of m515 problems before you get one,I have owned it for about 5 months. it worked perfectly. All of a sudden the 515 stopped recognizing the connection to the PC and it used to freeze. Some times it just has the green light on and the screen is dead. palm is not addressing the issues pertaining to this nature of problems the right way. Hard or soft resets of the 515 provided no relief. SUDS and GLC are two issues to look for.I paid ($$$) and it was a waste. I'd advise prospective buyers to make a wise choice by reading about the problems on the web before one plunges for the purchase.
3,Worked great for about a year,I absolutely loved this handheld until it stopped syncing.When I started having this issue I contacted Palm immediately. They said it was a problem with static electricity - or something like that - and promised to send me a card to reset the thing. Well they took months to send it and it still didn't work. Now my warranty is over and they won't honor my claim although it started during the warranty period. I am not going to pay $125.00. It just isn't worth it.Now it is nothing more than a play toy for my children.
1,Hot Sync Problems,"I really really liked my palm until one day it stopped syncing. I didn't do anything to it, it just no longer made a connection with the USB on my computer. My warranty was up so I had to pay if I wanted to talk to the Palm tech support people. I did some searching on the internet and discovered that many others had the same problem--funny Palm made no mention of that as I went through all the trouble shooting wizards on their website. Also really irritating that they do not have a way to solve the problem. Palm does have a program that will drain the battery which apparantly makes the palm sync again, but many Internet posts have said that this makes the battery fritzy thereafter. I have purchased a serial cradle which apparently is free of the syncing problem to hopefully allow me to use my palm again. No matter how good the product is, if it doesn't sync with my computer it is WORTHLESS."
1,It wont't turn on after only 2 weeks,"I just received this M515 as an upgrade from M505 and I'm sorry to say that it just stopped working. It won't turn on and when I do erase all my data and get it working again, it stops working after about 30 seconds. I contacted Palm and they are sending a a REFURBISHED model as a replacement..... ...? I am very upset. If it's working, it's great but I'm not sure why something that costs so much stops working for no reason. I think it should work longer than 2 weeks. The color display is definitely better than the M505 but I never, ever had any problems with it."
1,Major design flaw: Turns itself on and drains its batteries,"Although the Palm m515 may have many nice features, they are all dwarfed by one huge design flaw: it turns itself on at the slightest touch. The result is that if you carry the m515 in your purse, briefcase, or pocket, the inevitable jostling will cause the unit to turn on, and the batteries will deplete within a day. This is a disaster if you travel alot, and annoying even if you don't, since if you ever forget to charge it one evening, it will be dead when you try to use it the next.Those who attribute the short battery life to the color screen, overuse, etc. are mistaken, and probably don't realize that their Palm is actually turned on for large portions of the day. Testers who evaluate battery life in a laboratory don't know the real story either.Save yourself the headache and avoid this product. There are plenty of other handhelds out there that don't require this level of attention."
5,MAC and PC use,"To enable data redundancy on multiple computers in multiple locations, multiplatform, I chose this value product to communicate with an OS 9.1 MAC"
1,BEWARE OF SUDS!!!,"One week ago my year old m515 quit hot synching for no apparent reason. After spending many hours and three days on the phone with Palm tech support and being bounced back and forth to my computer OS support and losing all my data needlessly, I heard about SUDS --static build up that causes the entire m500 series to just stop hot synching. After doing some research online I found that Palm just settled a class action suit in 12/03 regarding this matter.Apparently their techs have not read the manuals because not one of the six I spoke to had a clue. BEWARE OF THIS DESIGN FLAW AND THE LACK OF A TRAINED SUPPORT STAFF!!!"
1,It just doesn't work,"I used to be a Palm enthusiast until I bought this model. A few months after purchse, it stopped hot syncing. When I got a replacement, it also stopped working after a few months. Very disappointing. I wouldn't have written this review, except that the two people I recommended this model to have also experienced the same problem."
1,Palm is a no no,"I have had this 515 six months and am returning it to palm a second time for the same reason, it simply dies. I took very good care of it. The first time it took forever to get a replacement, and i had to have our IT manager deal with them as they would not even give me a return authorization code so I could return it. I am finished with Palm, the technology on there end is unimpressive compared to what Dell is doing (Axim pocket PC), and Dell is MUCH easier to deal with. I am returning everything to Palm with a letter, we will see what happens, and if they stand behind there efforts..... I should also mention this is my second Palm, and I am not going for strike three..........."
5,Worth Owning,"I have two Palm m515's, and after four+ years of daily use and syncing, both are still going strong. In fact they both outlasted my Treo 600 and Palm T/X.This is a great low risk investment now that it is five years old. A great entry level PDA."
4,Great purchase,This PDA works as advertised with no problems associated with battery life or device failures yet.
4,Great palm,"I bought this palm to use as a college recruiting device. I haven't used palms in the past and this was very easy to navigate and use.Positives: Display screen options (off, low, high) depending on what level of brightness you want to have. I used the ""off"" setting because then it hardly used the battery at all and I could still see it just fine (I'm in my early 20s). Very easy to use. Great product for the cost.Negatives: Mine didn't come with an AC charger - only a computer charger. Some of the symbols (heart, diamond, spade, club) used in my recruiting application showed up as letters/numbers/periods because it's an older device and it didn't recognize the symbols. A couple of times it would report a ""fatal error"" and I just had to do a soft reset and it was fixed (all information was still there, but it was kind of annoying to search for a safety pin for the soft reset).Overall, I like this product for the very simple uses I have for it."
2,sd card slot?,"I found it for $5 and like messing around with old elctronic gadgets,if you feel safe downloading from 100s of random websties theirs alot of different apps for it like countdown clocks, and maps. I tried downloading some things onto an sd card for it but couldnt get it to work. if you find one for $10 the only thing its good for is a digital memo pad. you can get another palm handheld that does x5 as much as it does for the same price, or you could by a tablet or an ipad. pda's have died out becuase cell phones can do the same thing. pda's were originally used for bussiness, time killers, and checking flights.EVERY OTHER REVIEW IS FROM 2003 OR 2004 WHICH IS WHEN IT CAME OUT , BACK THEN IT WAS REALLY GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD THE MONEY FOR IT."
2,need improve,Not as bright as you see on the web! Need a lot of improvement. Don't invest money on this item.
3,"Pretty Good, but i must have gotten it too late...","I did lots of research on the m 515 and was very sure that this was the handheld for me. I was very disapointed with picture display and some other stuff. This is when i realized i shouldve gotten a pocket pc.But its still pretty good for taking notes, or a to do list."
3,not very versatile,"My doubts proofed right. No major improvements compared to the 505 device. It's easy so become familiar with this handheld, but you won't be satisfied with the rather small range of applications and the poor software lineup. Don't know, why Palm is always boasting about their products. They are no match for an up-to-date pocket PC. You could expect more value for your money. The CPU is definately outdated and the display's iow resolution makes serious applications still unavaillable for Palm users. Though I own a 515 now, but I don't think I'll use it very often. Rather stick to my Compaq 3870 - it's heavy and too big but it gets done all thinkable tasks.The Palm 515 is not really bad, but it makes you feel naked when confronted with complex tasks that require professional software solutions. It's just an organizer - a very flash one of course."
2,Not a computer,"I wanted this Palm to be so much more. I guess I was expecting it to be a handheld computer and unfortunately it's not much more that a color personal organizer.My only other complaint is that there is no control over the display (brightness, contrast) that was there is earlier models."
1,"Nice product, lousy customer service","I'm a previous Palm Vx user. When I had a chance to upgrade to color, I jumped at the chance. Unfortunately, the M515 I received was a lemon that wouldn't hold a charge. Doesn't sound like a huge problem, just call Customer Service, right? I called when my unit was less than 2 weeks old. I was told to return it to Palm AT MY COST and they would repair it. Can't replace it, won't pay for shipping. It would take a minimum of 2-3 weeks to get it back. In the meantime, I have nothing. I'm out the bucks it costs to ship. I love the product, but hate the manufacturer. Another case of business not caring for the customer. Next upgrade? I'll probably look at other options."
5,"If you want a PALM, this is the right PDA for you","I recently purchased the M515. As advertised, the screen is far brighter and better than the M505. The great thing is that PALM managed to keep the battery life as long as the M505. So far, I think it's a great upgrade from my Palm Vx. The same compact and slim design. You can actually carry this one around in your pocket opposed to some other PDAs. Lastly, the software that is out there is amazing, and the expandability and reliablity makes the PALM better than Pocket PCs and even Sony Clie, despite the lower resolution.Great buy, in my opinion"
4,WHere is the Hi-res Screen?,"This PDA is really a high end PDA. I love my m515 but I have three complaints about it...1.- Where is the Hi-res screen? I can't beleive Sony won the race to release this kind of screen.2.- Batteries are an issue when you're on the go, with extended use they drain within a few hours.3.- not being able to use 128 MB MMC, does anyone knows why you can't use a 128 MB MMC?But about the m515 itself, you get a light PDA, very well designed, plenty of room to store your programs and info, a wide variety of connections, accesories and software.Personally I prefer Palm than any other brand of Palm OS PDAs but the complaints I wrote in this review are an issue for me. I hope that Palm will overcome this and get to the market soon a Hi-res screen device, better batteries and I hope that with Palm OS 5 you will be able to use 128MB MMC."
4,M515 is great!!,"I recently purchased the m515 to replace my m505 that was stolen. The 515 is greatly improved in three areas: battery life, memory, and display brightness. Memory is doubled from 8MB to 16MB. The color display is much brighter and very easy to read. The 515 also offers low and high settings for the display, something that was missing on the 505. But the best improvement has been in battery life. My 505 battery life was horrible, but my 515 can go several days without needing a charge. However, these improvements come at a price. The 515 is slightly thicker than the 505, not too much, but noticeable. The 515 is a great little handheld, and worthy of the extra price over the 505."
2,Did not live up to the title...,"Ok - I had no idea what this book was about when I picked it up at the library used book sale. I only knew that the cover art was interesting (vaguely Matisse-like café scenes) and that I thought the title was great (I love the word ""Brazen"" - so evocative and sadly underused!). The opening scenes - an accident involving an explosion, flying shrapnel, and a wounded artist - suggested faint hints of The Gargoyle, which I loved. And then I kept reading. And realized I was WAY off. And then I looked the book up online and realized it was French erotic fiction - and then it all made a little more sense. It is a tale of obsession, but falls somewhat flat in both the erotic and the fictional aspects. After a somewhat enjoyable beginning, I rapidly found myself utterly indifferent to the fate of all of the characters and utterly disinterested in their sexcapades. Suffice to say I don't think this one quite lived up to the title - but I still think the title is great!"
5,A Must Have,"powder blue is an interesting new work from Ms Flather, a talented New York singer/ songwriter. Its strength is its highly personal and intense self-exploration of the concerns of living against the backdrop of wider events. Its sense is in its refusal to abandon personal quests and concerns. Its passion is in the desire to seek meaning in the smaller spheres of people and concerns that we all inhabit every day. Its hope lies in its understanding that possibility lies within us - and they tell me that darkness wins / if we don't begin."
1,Everything is wrong with this book,"From the blurb on the back cover this book looked like it would be a fun weekend read. To bad that's not the case. This book combines all the worst of really bad series Sci Fi and really brainless Romance. On top of that I found something about the writing style choppy and hard to read. Even the characters internal thoughs seemed stilted and awkward. The plot had some promise, but there was no follow through."
4,cool band,"I saw these guys in concert with the other two best bands in the world(MxPx, and Blink182), back when their name was still riverfenix. They put on an awesome show, and this cd proves that they can make an awesome album, too."
5,FENIX TX ARE LIKE BLINK182! GREAT!,"This CD should be six starrs! Its sooooooo good! They sound just like Blink182. Blink182 is the best band, but these guys are just like them! Every song is funny, and not popish. This ""boy-band"" acutally plays insturments too! Not like BSB and N Sync. And its not about luv and mush! How about that? Isn't that just weird! The videos are great, and its just a fab CD! If ya don't have it, go get it! If your a Blink182 fan, and ya don't have FenixTX's self titled CD, GO GET IT!"
5,great cd,i would like to say that fenix tx is a great band. who cares about the bond that blink has with them. there great. check out there cd to see for your self
3,This is pretty spiffy!,"Riverfenix....ummm, I mean Fenix*TX is a really good band. Everytime I listen to this CD, I become more infatuated with it. Most of the tracks on here are very catchy and fast. I like how this band is all about fun and having a good time. They really have that happy type of sound. To me, the best songs on here are ""Speechless"", ""Flight 601(All I've Got Is Time)"", ""All My Fault"", and ""Philosophy"" If you're into Blink 182, Mxpx or Unwritten Law, pick this CD up because you'll like umm so enjoy it fully and completely!"
3,"Good, but their second cd blows it out of the water","I heard ""Lechuza"" first, which might not have been the best thing to do. Anyway, I really liked ""Lechuza"", and I decided to pick up their first CD, and what I got was a mixed bag.It's good......but there is a great improovement between this and Lechuza. Lechuza is a much better cd. Everything on this cd, has been improoved with Lechuza, from guitaring, basslines, and lyrics. It's still a good cd though, don't get me wrong.""Flight 601"", ""Minnimum Wage"", ""All My Fault"", and ""Ben"" are all amazing songs, and the best on the cd. The other songs are good, but they are mostly rehashes of Blink, the same problem with the Sum 41 cd. However, it's enough too keep your attention, something that the Sum 41 cd did not.In the end, it's a good listen, but Lechuza is the better cd by far. Pick it up though, you'll most likely enjoy it."
1,these guys aren't punk,"I consider River Fenix a great punk band. Fenix TX is a cheap rip off of their old, fast style. This may be an awesome album to anyone that likes the trendy Blink style. But for anyone that likes real punk music, stay away from this album."
4,Great First try,I think this band will make it big. It has a lot going for it and a lot of the songs are very catchy. The funniest song on the cd is the last one. Buy this CD if you can't wait for Blink 182's CD or you like bands like Bowling for Soup.
5,GREAT......for a debut album,"Alright first thing first. Come on lets face it....they sound alot like Blink 182. The guitar, bass, even the lead singer sounds like Tom Delonge of Blink 182. The only difference is that Fenix,Tx has one more guitar than blink and Travis (and Scott) are/were better drummers then the drummer for Fenix,Tx. Not really too original but that doesn't mean it's bad. Songs are very similar to that of So.Cal punk. You know, ""my girl is gone so woe is me"" type stuff. If you like Blink 182 then you'll love this cd. My favorite bands are Less than Jake, Goldfigner, MxPx, Reel Big Fish, The Hippos, etc. So if you like any of that stuff then you'll like this cd"
3,They say true punk is hard to find...,"This CD really isn't bad at all. However from a punk prespective, this just doesn't cut it. The poppy songs have catchy lyrics and seem a bit generic. If you like pop-punk then this is a perfect CD for you. If you're a true punk, then these sell-outs aren't worth a dime."
4,I like Fenix Tx but not blink 182,"I like this cd it has some very good songs but i actually HATE blink 182 so you dont have to like blink or unwritten law to like Fenix Tx or RiverFenix, the songs are poppy punk and blink 182 definetly has an influnce on these guys. Their songs are cool but i cant stand some of these songs on this cd. It takes a couple of times to get into the cd but after that you'll get into it"
1,"I give it no stars, actually... it blows.","Look, this CD, though banal and ill-conceived like a debut CD, is not... get that through your heads. These charming gentlemen were the band River Fenix, and had releases since 96... anyways, this is a terrible CD, uninventive, clichéd and down right scary... I'm just amazed that they could go from this trite sack of power pop punk garbage to the even more abominable and insipid neo-emo now on the radio with their latest release..."
4,Not even close to as good as Blink,"This cd is not bad at all but how can anyone say that they are better than blink? blink is by far the best. these guys are a wanna be blink 182, they sound like them in so many ways. even so, they are not bad, but blink rules and are the greatest band around. These guys are smart to take after them."
1,DON'T BUY THIS GARBAGE,"Don't buy this CD, it's another blink 182. If you want punk buy Goldfinger ""Stomping Ground"" or ""Hang-up's."" If you want ska buy Reel Big Fish ""Why Do They Rock So Hard"""
2,fenix tx...aka blink183,"If you like blink182 i can pretty much say you'll like this cd. why? because fenix tx are blink182 rip offs. they are leeching off the success of blink by trying to write songs as similar as possible- this is one of the first cases of manufactured punk i have seen. whereas blink translated juvenile frat boy humour to the masses with songs like 'depends', fenix make a similar effort with 'rooster song' which wasn't funny- just irritating. 'surf song' has to be one of the tackiest things i've ever heard. ""i wish i was surfing""? oh please. and as for the radio friendly 'flight 601...' i felt like i had heard it a million times before. i hate to be shallow, but all this might be excusable if they were good looking but they are really not, and they are unoriginal and unfunny. invest in real talent like mxpx, blink and the ataris, and watch losers like fenix get eaten alive by teenyboppers."
3,"Very much like Blink 182, but better.","Don't tell me Blink 182 didn't influence these guys. They have similar sound and singers. Heck, just like Blink 182, they only wrote three chord progressions and used them over and over and over again in their songs (the songs sound the same)! However, some songs on this cd are just amazing, like ""Flight 601(All I've Got Is Time)"", ""All My Fault"", and ""Speechless"". They have way better melodies than Blink 182, and their sound is fatter. Overall, a good band, but they need a bit of work."
1,TERRIBLE excuse for punk,"Now, i'll admit that I'm not the biggest punk follower. But when I heard they were touring with Blink-182, I decided to buy this CD just to give them a try. While ""All My Fault"" may be catchy for a while, the more I couldn't stand it. THEN I saw them in concert, the WORST warmup band performance i have EVER seen, and I havent touched the CD since. Please don't buy this, even if ""All MyFault"" may sound good, it DOES get old."
4,great pop punk,"Fenix tx may be viewed as ""sell outs"" but they are a good punk band. Yes, they do sound like blink and are on mtv and I even got an email asking me to vote for them on trl, but they still sound good. They are also one of the best live bands out there. check out new found glory, millencolin and midtown if you like this kind of music."
2,severely over-rated,"Since Blink went big, this band has been riding around on their butts hoarding their fame. It's silly to say that Fenix doesnt sound like Blink, because Fenix sound more like Blink than Blink do: at least Blink vary their songs a little bit. Every Fenix TX song sounds like the 'generic' blink song. Back about 3 years ago, when they were called Riverfenix, they were okay for a new band, i thought maybe some day they would develop a sound of their own and get better. but they NEVER changed at all.. they sound the same now as they once did, or worse. Their only acceptably tolerable song is 'All my Fault'.. go download that song and you've got the only worthwhile thing off the cd. People who whine about bands like Less Than Jake, Green Day, or Home Grown changing their sound should be forced to listen to this crap, as a warning to what happens if your band never evolves or gets better."
5,fenix tx is awesome,"fenix tx is going to be huge. pure punk rock. awesome cd. BUY IT NOW, I COMMAND YOU!! yeah, they sound kinda like blink-182, but OLD blink-182, like cheshire cat or buhdda stuff. also sound like sr-71. thats all i have to say."
4,Great debut,"This is a great CD and a great find by Mark Hoppus of Blink182. Yes, it seems as if these guys were influenced by Blink, but some songs have their very own style, like ""Flight 601"" and ""Surf Song"". The best song on this CD has to be ""Speechless"" because it is so catchy and it has great lyrics. These guys can hold their own even without Blink. These guys were on the ""Mark Tom and Travis Tour"" and they were excellent, and it seems as if these guys are going to be huge."
1,Sent Wrong Tea Twice,I ordered this Tea twice and they kept sending Twinnings Breakfast Tea....So thats why I rated it zero...I would like to try it But I am through trying to order it because they cant seem to correct the Problem...
1,Terrible green tea,"I usually love anything from twinings, but this is the worst green tea I've ever had. I bought a box of this because my grocery story was out of what I usually get (Stash decaf green tea). I saw that twinings carried a decaf green tea, and since I trust twinings, I thought I'd give it a try.It is GRITTY, BITTER, SOUR, and nothing like what green tea really tastes like. I can barely get a good strength of tea from one bag.Do not buy this tea."
1,Awful,"This product has no resemblance to green tea, in color or flavor. I tried it once and threw the rest out. I know and love Japanese style green tea, and decaf green never tastes as good as regular green. Even so, Bigelow's decaf green is much less offensive than this one. Perhaps if I didn't know this Twinings was supposed to be green tea, I wouldn't dislike it so much, but it's not worth suffering through the whole box to find out."
4,"Good book, but some college needed.","Lots of good theory and application on electric motors, but to get the most out of it, you really should have 2 semesters of college level physics and 1 semester of electrical engineering. The book covers the theory of how and why motors work, but could have been a better book with a simple explanation as a preface to each chapter. Also, a simple explanation of the differences between the various types motors. It seems that this is a sophmore level college text and is excellent for that purpose."
1,Don't be mislead!,"The ""Enchanting Children's Tale of Courage"" review above is listed under the wrong book. The book the reviewer refers to is actually a completely different book titled ""Momo,"" and is written by Michael Ende, not Amile Ajar. The Momo by Amile Ajar is not a ""beautifully written"" story about a young girl who goes against social norms to make the world a better place. It is a story about a young boy in France who lives in a foster home for children of prostitutes, and acts out by shitting all over the house and encouraging the other kids to do so too. While this may be your cup of tea, it's not likely to inspire children. Or maybe it is, in which case I'd be very afraid of what it might inspire them to do."
5,Finally back in print,"The Chanur series is made up of 5 books. A prologue novel (""The Pride of Chanur""), a 3-part series (""Chanur's Venture"", ""The Kif Strike Back"" and ""Chanur's Homecoming""), and an epilogue novel (""Chanur's Legacy"").The first 3 books are collected in ""The Chanur Saga"" omnibus volume -- an odd collection since the concluding volume of the central trilogy is HERE, and not in the badly selected ""Saga"".Note that this book does NOT stand on it's own. You need to start with ""The Chanur Saga"""
5,Lost Gem,"Like the title suggests, this album is one of the lost gems of the 90's. With MC5 underpinnings and 60's-esque style, but with their own voice, this album rocks from beginning to end. Sadly, I believe this was their only record, but it's one I've been listening to for almost 15 years now and I still love it. Buy an old crappy van, go on a road trip, stop at a random park, take your shirt off, throw a frisbee, drink some beers, and pick up some babes. Enter the Men's Club. You won't be sorry."
4,I d say this is good.,"I only wear it at night because of the thickness and the color. I just slather this on and in the morning the blue seems to be gone, I don't think I rub it off in the night but perhaps it sinks in. Anyways, I am happy with it."
5,works great on this 59 yr old,This is one of the best products I have used for dark circles. It helps the bags and the wrinkles but really good for the dark circles. I was concerned about the blue but it doesnt show blue on my skin.
2,It's ok but no cumulative effect,"Ive used this eye cream for 2+ months and it does work some but there are pluses and minuses for me:First: its blue and goes on blue. It does however sink in pretty fast. I have deep skin tone but in a lighter skinned person, I think it may take a minute to fully sink in.Second: it does work to diminish my dark circles, but it doesn't last more than a few hours. I use it morning and night and by the time between my applications, I can tell it's stopped working. So unlike a lot of other eye creams, I didn't think my eyes looked better and better with repeated use.Third: it's thick but it still seeps into my eyes and it irritates them a bit. I have to be careful not to get it too close.Fourth: Good value. At 10$ the jar arrives full and I only need a tiny tiny amount, so it should last quite awhile.Overall, I'll finish the jar but I don't think I'll repurchase as I'm looking for a product with a cumulative effect."
1,Doesn't work...,"This seemed like a good deal - a game for the car. But, the game is too small to work correctly. The balls don't bounce enough and you always have to be moving the base to catch any balls. Wish I would have just bought the full size version for the kids."
5,Great value,"Since I wasn't sure if my 4 year old would enjoy playing this game, I didn't want to pay the price of the original size. When I saw this travel size and the price, I couldn't pass on purchasing it. Well, she loves this game! She loves playing it and I loved the price and the portability. It's 7.5 inches in diameter so it's a little small for my 8 year old but it's perfect size for my 4 yr old. When we play with her, we use one finger to push the lever (to be gentle) since it isn't a heavy duty plastic. I can see this eventually breaking but we've gotten a lot of enjoyment from it and well worth the price."
3,"Great concept, difficult to play","The game itself is compact and enclosed, which makes it perfect for travel. The plastic seems to be cheap in quality and i'm not sure how long it will actually hold up. The game is fine to play on a table top but when it comes to traveling in the car it is very difficult because the marbles sway the direction of the car. It makes it hard if not impossible to play while in transit."
2,doesn't work very well,"for a travel size its a good size, but it really doesn't work very well, the hippos don't open the mouths well at all"
1,crappy,tiny and impossible to play because you cant control the balls... wtf . .. the idea was cool. . .
3,Too small,The little plastic balls are tough to catch and don't really fall back into the line of play. The only good thing? it's all enclosed.
3,Game for my toddlers to share,"As described, but pretty small.Good thing is that there's no way for the little balls to come out of the game to get lost.I imagine that it will only be a matter of time until the black plastic tabs to work the hippos will break.Still a cute game that my kids actually play together."
2,Double-Edged Hippo,Difficult for children to play. The noise is the most entertaining for the grandchildren and the most annoying for everyone around them.
5,Love the Marbles are enclosed,This game is great for travel but also for littler ones who want to play but marbles are too small for choking hazard. Totally recommend this!
5,Great for young children. No loose parts!,I bought this toy for my children at Christmas. I love that there are no lose parts to lose. It is great for younger children because there is no choking hazards. It only has 2 hippos though so if you want to play with more than 2 then you need the full sized one. I have a destructive child that likes to stand on things and break them and he has yet to break this toy. So it gets five starts from me lol!
4,"30 yrs later and the balls still get stuck, LOL",This tiny version of this game is just like it was in the 80's. My 5 yr old got sick of it in a day but my one year old loves it. I play it by my self to irritate the kids sometimes...LOL
2,Crappy version of the real thing,"I got this thinking it would a great little toy for my toddler, but i couldn't even get the hippos to 'eat' the balls. The mechanism keeps getting jammed, the balls keep getting stuck in between the hippo and the plastic dome... i got frustrated with it so i could only imagine the melt down with my child. It does say 4 and up, but i am well over 4 and i couldnt get the toy to work. waste of money, get the real one."
3,Does not keep attention,"My friend had one of these and said my daughter spent hours playing it. As they love the big version but cannot play it often because I'm afraid our baby will eat the balls, I figured this was a great option. It was a Christmas toy and by New Years it had lost its interest. I'm not sure they've looked at it since."
3,"Arrived pretty quick, Haven't opened it yet","We bought this four our son and daughter because the reviews of the big one say they are garbage any more. It is a christmas present, so I cannot comment on the toy itself yet."
3,"More information, please","I have some old cast iron Harley toy motorcycles. There are only a few cast iron toys shown and there is no information on condition vs value. I also have some sterling silver Harley Davidson pins, one similar to a police badge with a skull and wings, one skull and wings only, and one is a winged Harley logo. No information what-so-ever on items like these pins. This book could have been more comprehensive."
5,Great story well written,I have been reading this to my 8 year old son for a few weeks and he loves it. The story is very interesting and illustrations are beautiful. The level seems just right for his age and older. I also have a 5 year old and it may be a little above her level at the moment. We only have a few chapters to go and I am looking forward to reading it to my daughter when she is a little older. I also got a lot out of this book and find it a very calming way to end the day.
5,Lovely book,"We're not Buddhists. I bought this book some time ago and my kids had no interest in having me read it to them. (I read it to myself and enjoyed it.) But recently, my 8-year-old daughter picked it out of the bookshelf and thought the pictures were cool, so she asked me to read it to her. While I read, my 10-year-old daughter happened to overhear some, and she liked it well enough to pick it up and read is on her own afterwards. So be patient -- younger kids probably aren't interested in something this wordy.I'm not sure if it's the story itself or this telling of it, but it is very thought provoking for my children. What would it be like to have never seen sickness? What would it be like to give up your family to seek truth? Some people have many luxeries and others suffer a great deal, what can we do about that?"
5,Excellent Start for Buddhist Kids,"The little guy i bought this for loves it. It is simple, beautifully illustrated, and content laden with great values. Some Buddhist lit for kids is too vague & overly symbolic, but this book tells the story of Prince Siddhartha well. There are some short moral stories at the end aside from the life story e.g. the Buddha & the angry elephant."
5,Finally - genuinely relaxing piano music!,"Gentle piano solos with such great sound quality that you'd swear you were seated with the performer! This is a CD with quality background music for work, reading, meditating... whatever. It's there without being intrusive or insipid, as so many ""relaxation"" CDs are. This artist has a tremendous sense of rhythm and melody. Thanks for making this CD!"
1,Disappointing,"Somewhere there must be a gay writer who can combine escapism sex with a PLOT. He sure is not Paul Alexander. The storyline is there in theory: journalist Nathan Dexter goes undercover in the London Leatherscene to expose a slavery ring. He falls in love with a handsome young student who may be out to betray him. LOADS (ahem) of opportunity for rollicking sex and rollicking adventure. All we get is the sex, and after awhile it gets boring. It gets numbing, in fact. Mr. Publisher, I don't need to buy a book for this kind of reading experience, I can get these cheap thrills from magazines."
3,A snapshot of Maugham's genius,"As short as Of Human Bondage is long and as prosaic as The Razor's Edge is profound, Up at the Villa fails to inspire the way these aforementioned works of genius or other such timeless tomes as Cakes and Ale or Moon and Sixpence.This book, however, was not all bad. It was eminently enjoyable and, as all of Maugham's efforts, was a pleasure to read. Maugham's gift with the English language is unsurpassed and vastly underrated. Unfortunately, Up at the Villa just didn't have enough Maugham. Not enough characterization or plot or theme development as I would have liked and have grown accustomed to with the genius of Maugham. I have yet to see the movie with Kristin Scott Thomas and Sean Penn, although I'm sure I will in due time. Overall, if you thoroughly enjoy Maugham as I do, check it out at the library.""That's what life's for - to take risks.""- Rowley to Mary"
4,"Romantic, quick and suspenseful","I thought this novel offered an interesting look at how passion and spontaneity can develop into confusion and regret. The characters are well developed and have wonderful interactions with each other, especially Mary (the protagonist) and Rowley (the ""unsavory"" character). It is an enjoyable quick read, and the romance is set well against the suspenseful atmosphere."
4,Good Read,"Mystery, suspense, romance, human frailties! Plus the aura of the late 1930's from an author of the time. I really enjoyed the book. It is a short tale and a quick read. I'm anxious to see the movie."
3,St. Patrick's Day in Jesus Creek,"A serial killer is coming to Jesus Creek, Tennessee. While all the residents are getting ready for the big St. Patrick's Day celebration, fear is stalking the town. I enjoyed the first two books about Jesus Creek a bit more than this one. Seems like the author was stretching a little farther to come up with a plausible plot. Was not a mystery that kept me up late trying to finish it."
2,Too cloying,I used Bath and Bodyworks Brown Sugar and Fig several years ago and loved it. They must have changed the formulation or something because now I find it way too cloying and heavy and very perfumey. What used to be a light musk scent is now a strong flowery scent. I won't be buying this again.
5,Great value,"This item cost 1/3 less than at a home decorating store. Blends beautifully with my shiny chrome bathroom fixtures & provides plenty of light. Placed the fixture above a 30"" bath vanity. Easy installation. Can install with lights up or down. We chose lights up. Item received in a timely manner and in excellent condition."
2,not as described,"after reading some of the past reviews, this item appears to be a great complement to the vlair air compressor. however, when items arrived the topeak actually cannot be used with the vlair air compressor. the vlair unit already has the screw type connector and the male thread of the topeak is too small. do not buy if you intend to use with vlair air compressors."
5,for baby stroller,we bought this to pump air for our baby stroller which works really well!Very useful tool if you have small wheel to pump air into
2,Slow Fill,"The tire vavles on my boat trailer are a little hard to get to, and this connector was exactly what I was looking for. However, when I used it the first time it barely worked at all. It took 25 minutes to take the pressure from 10 lbs to 35 lbs, at which time I gave up. As best I can determine, the connector did not fully engage the schraeder valve on the tire. I tried to adjust the connector and then broke it.I'd give this a one star, except for the fact that the screw on design is very functional. It would work great if you have 45 minutes or so per tire."
1,Not recomended,"I purchased a Viair compressor and based on the comments purchased this as a quick fill in order to avoid having to screw on the compressor to the valve stem. This does not work as described, air leaks everywhere from this and does not have a good seal on the valve stem. Save your money"
1,Anti-Air loss - Major Flow restriction.,"Just attaching this connector to my 12 volt auto compressor caused the enough back pressure to cause the gauge to read 30 PSI. It may be useful for something, but I can't think of what. It more than doubles inflation time as it cuts the flow rate to less than 50%. Bought 2. If I can find package I will return them both. But I will definitely return at least 1 of them."
4,Topeak 90 degree schrader valve adapter,I used this 90 degree adapter for inflating 14 inch tires on my bicycle trailer. I have 2 frame pumps and a foot pump where I just couldn't get the pump head on the valve stem then lift the cam lever. The 90 degree bend is a little cumbersome but still works where as without it doesn't work at all.
5,Excellent Product !!,"This pressure air loss connector gauge works Great !!! I have a screw on connector from my air compressor, but this ensures I lose no air. Great Product !!"
3,"Confusing, but seems to work","I tried to use this thing, and was confused because I was creating a lot of pressure in it that wasn't transferring. What you need to know about this thing is that it will NOT add pressure to your shock/tire/whatever until the pressure inside this nozzle exceeds that in what you're airing up. That seems to be how it's intended to work. There isn't really anything in the instructions that tell you that, so I thought I had junk at first, but then I realized it works just fine, as intended."
2,Can't get it to work,I've tried to make this work a couple of times now but I haven't been successful. Maybe I bought the wrong product or something but I'm just using it on a standard bicycle tube with a normal pump.
2,Know what you've got!,"This is not an oem pump for the 20 gallon tank. The white plastic cylinder can be modified to lengthen the included pump. Also, the round gasket is wrong for the 20 gallon tank. You'll need to find the proper rectangular gasket and also the ""in tank"" filter.Best of luck."
2,Didn't work for me,"I understand this to be a classic, but I was looking for distilled information to keep me alive. It may be here, but it is certainly not distilled. Much attention by the author to the reasons for his trips, his companions, etc. etc. If you are looking (as I was) for a handbook this isn't it!"
3,If it's gonna blow...,"stay the hell out of the water! That's what I gained from reading this book.He details his exploits and the exploits of others when encountering storm after storm during sailing yacht races.Every chapter is an encounter with yet another storm. That can wear on you after a while. Sort of like being out all day in a strong cold wind. I felt beat up just reading about it.At the begining of each chapter I kept finding myself willing him ""Don't do it! You're going to regret it!"" But, there are no surprises. He gets nailed every time. The only thing that amazes me is that he's still alive.If that's the kind of book you like, you'll love this one. Me, I'm staying on shore."
4,One of the Better,"Of all the Pregnancy magazines I have read, this seemed to have a lot of information, good easy workouts and some healthy meals to make."
2,Not about fitness,"As an avid exceriser and former fitness instructor hungry for real information about mainitaining fitness during pregnancy, I was very hopeful about this magazine. Unfortunately, it is as vague and basic in its fitness advice as most other parenting/baby magazines, and focuses mainly on fashion, baby gear, and pregnant celebrities. I have found it very frustrating that there is so little concrete advice for future mothers out there - you would expect a magazine with this title to have more than the occasional short blurb on walking for fitness or two-paragraph article on the benefits of prenatal yoga (with no specifics, of course). I'm about to deliver, and have had to figure out the fitness thing on my own...this magazine was no help."
2,Waste of time,I sent off for this magazine when I heard that I was pregnant and was so excited to receive it. I am now almost 5 months pregnant and have to date still not received the magazine as it takes 12 to 16 weeks for the first issue to get to you. What also amazes me is that the subscription is for 12 months but a pregnancy only lasts 9 months and by the time I get my first issue - I will only be pregnant for another 4 months. Surely the sebscription should be for 6 months and there shouldn't be such a long waiting period.
1,Save your money!,"Im 7 weeks pregnant and received a free issue of this magazine at the doctor's office. I found myself digging for the articles in between all the ads. I found tiny tidbits of ""advice"" sprinkled here and there but nothing new.This magazine didnt offer anything uselful at all. It actually made me feel a little guilty for indulging in pizza this weekend. It doesn't provide encouragement or advice you haven't heard already. You are better off reading up on pregnancy on pregnancy and baby websites on the web.Save your money. I am glad I didnt pay for this magazine."
5,Native Kansan,"This book is of interest to me because of my Kansas heritage. However, most of the material contained is from before my birth. Yet, it is a valuable piece of Kansas history. The book is exactly what I expected, and I am well-satisfied with it. The service from this distributor was excellent."
5,Good product / Great Service,Great strings. after many years of playing the Elixir's top any others I have used.
4,Experimenting With Various Acoustic Strings,"Lately I have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings.....to the less and also most expensive strings. I find the Elixir excellent. My testing is ongoing and cannot give the Elixir a top rating yet. That may change along the way.However, I believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine. What may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone else's palate. Therefore, strings that may sound good to my ear may not sound good to someone else's ear.My ears remain attentive to future string sounds. I also love the d'Addario make. Which I purchase through Amazon...always."
5,Awesome strings!,"I've had these on my Yamaha APX500 for a while now and they sound really good. A tad brighter than I like, but that's just the nature of the lightness of the strings. It's real smooth when playing and they seem to be lasting longer than most strings I try. In fact, I've had these strings on for over 4 months now and they still feel and sound good."
5,Elixir nanoweb strings,These strings are amazing. They have a very long life. Usually three months of daily use. (I have used them for five months.) The bass strings stay bright much longer. Stop buying a new set every month.
5,LOVE THEM!,"Have used elixir's and d'addario strings and must say that every time i come back to Elixir it's refreshing. These nanowebs do really not affect your sound plus let you play longer before having to buy a new set.The gauge is perfect for my strumming and fingering style, I have no complains. Will buy again."
4,Makes a bright sound.,"This product makes a bright sound. Not as bright as the D'addario phosphor bronze wound, but still pretty bright. Not what I expected, but would probably be enjoyable for some/most people."
2,I don't Like Them,"I've tried these on several guitars of mine, including a Martin HD28, a Guild D15, a Guild JF-30 and a Guild F212XL. Yes, they last a long time, but the new sound can't compare with a conventional string. To me they sound moderately fatigued from the beginning, with a loss of sparkle and high end. On the 12 string they were acceptable, but that guitar had an abundance of highs to begin with.If playing amplified with a pickup they sound OK, but otherwise I don't want an expensive new string that sounds somewhat tired from the beginning. I'd rather use conventional strings and change them more often than play these. The Cleartone strings to my ear sound much better."
5,"New strings, or a new guitar?","Wow, these strings make my guitar sound great. I thought that I just had a bad guitar, but as it turns out, new Elixir strings make my guitar sound completely different, completely awesome. So much bass, clear treble. Sound great while recording. Buy these strings!"
3,"Nice tone, poor longevity","I bought these after reading all of the positive reviews.PROs: They sound really good. Nice warm full tone without too much high-end. Nice feel.Cons: Really bad durability. I've played these for the last 2 months (about 60-90 minutes/ day) Already the D string is showing little fraying white ""hairs"" sticking out at the sound hole area. I play fingerstyle with nails.Bottom line: I'd rather buy well made less expensive strings and change them out more frequently. 2 months seems really short for a string to start falling apart, IMO."
4,Not bad,"I can't recall if I ever paid enough attention to prefer the Nano's to the Polywebs, but I'm still all Elixirs, whether on the Martin or the Taylor."
5,The Best!,"Do your guitar a favor and only put Elixir guitar strings on it. I really am not sure whether I prefer the Nano's or the Poly's but I have been using the Poly's since they were still made in Flagstaff, AZ. I know many other guitar players and all of them rave about these strings."
5,worth the money,"i remember playing a set of these on my electric years ago. bought a set for my acoustic (yamaha, fg series from ~1980) and they sound great. for a cheap guitar the yamaha's have a great sound and these strings really pronounce it."
1,didn't last,"First of all, they didn't sound very good. But the real reason for the poor rating is because on of the strings snapped while I was tuning it... I'd only had them on for a few weeks."
3,"Great, but G string doesn't last","I've played with elixir strings since they first came out. I love the sound and the fact that they stay new for a long, long time. But it seems like about a year ago my g string started breaking way too early. I usually leave the strings on for about 3 months, but the g string has started breaking after about 1 month, or sometimes earlier depending on how much I play my acoustic. It breaks at the saddle and I make sure there are no burrs and that it's set up right, but it keeps breaking. I've talked to several other players in the area that have stopped using elixir for the same reason. If Elixir will get this fixed, I'll come back, but until then, I go with D'Addario DXR."
4,Elixir Strings,"These are really good strings, but somewhat expensive. These strings last a good while & easy on the fingers. Will continue to use."
5,Easily the best guitar strings out there.,"Let me preface this by saying I am in no way a guitar professional. But I do know a thing or two about music, and how to make an instrument sound good. I've been playing guitar for just shy of a year. But...These strings are by far the best. I broke a string (from a pack of Martin guitar strings)a few months ago and just recently got around to buying new Elixir's. They have transformed my cheapie hand-me-down into a guitar worthy of the greats. They have given me added confidence, they've improved my playing, and they sound literally amazing. I have no doubt in my mind these strings will last ""3-5x longer"" than their competitors. Do yourself a favor, especially if you're like me and still technically a beginner: Buy these strings. You won't regret it.Now, if only these callouses would re-form..."
3,Harsh,"I found Elixir Nanoweb 80/20s to be harsh and metallic and they didn't sound good when playing slide. These 80/20s also seemed to set off ""piezo quack"" more than others that I have used. Switched to the Elixir Nanoweb phosphor-bronze and have not had any problems."
5,"Amazing, smooth, clean strings.","They costed twice as much as my usual D'Addarios but after 2 weeks of use, I couldn't be any happier. I've heard only positive reviews about these Elixir strings and now understand why. They are smooth as butter thanks to the coating and sound bright, clean, and crisp. They also make my guitar look much nicer and shinier. A great buy overall."
3,Good for people with oily hands,These are good for people with oily hands but they do not sound nearly as good as non-coated strings. The tone is significantly duller. Many companies put these on the models they ship to stores because they last longer and are not ruined by oily handed people. I personally never use these coated strings but can see why they are popular with certain people and for situations where many different people will play the same instrument.
3,G string problems continue,"Same problem as some others, I bought a set for my acoustic just to check it out, G string gives me problems, feels different from other strings after a shorter period and seems to go out of tune more. I thought it was just my guitar but guess I am not the only one."
2,Dont let the reviews fool you,"I have only been through four sets of strings, and although I have no doubt that the claims of these guitar strings are indeed long lasting and sounds full these strings make a very....gnarly kind of sound especially the base strings and they echo this wierd echo. If you like CLEAN sounding guitar strings you may not like these, especially the base strings. These definitely have deep sound but they are not a clean deep sound its like an artificial gnarly folksy sound on the base strings. I bought the strings solely on the good reviews, I'm surprised there havent been more reviews with a more unbiased point of view. I can only surmise that either people are searching for this strings with this deep sound or they just havent played on many strings.So in short, if you like a clean loud sound you may not like this, if you like a deep folksy tone then these may be good for you. I will upload a video of some guitar using these strings"
1,"Poor quality, string snapped 3 days after return window closed",My husband is an experienced guitar player on both electric and acoustic guitars. He does not play the acoustic often as the electrics are his preferred guitar. He put these strings on his acoustic guitar when they arrived and the 4th time he picked up the guitar to play it the largest string snapped in half. I am not a guitar player and probably should have let him leave this review as I am not sure of the terms and names of these sort of things.. We cannot return the strings for a refund at this point because we no longer have the original receipt and or packing slip.We will not order Elixir strings again.
2,Defective string?,"Strings feel nice, easy on my fingers which helps a lot since I'm just starting to play. Sound quality is good, not much more I can say about the sound since I am a beginner and wont pretend to be a guru or anything about that. As for the longevity of the strings, maybe I just got a defective string, but the #1 string (high e) broke rather quickly. The rest of the strings are still fine. I'm just disappointed that it broke so quickly, it didn't even last as long as my previous strings even though it boasts that it lasts 3x longer."
2,"Great strings, bad seller?","First of all, I love these strings. I played on polywebs for a while, and now I'm using the nanowebs, and I'll use nothing else.I usually buy them at my local guitar center for about a buck or two more than the price here. These strings arrived already oxidized, like they were years old or had been opened once already and left open to the elements. They had a very dull sound - very uncharacteristic of these strings. Would not order these from Amazon again."
3,Great book,"This is a great book, clear and easy to read. Gives a good outline of process control but somewhat dated content. Still a valuable reference book on the subject."
2,Problem,"Not sure if it is the product or the individual unit, but this dumped data for no reason and I was unable to retrieve it. That was a pain reentering a load of names, addresses and appointments."
5,I LOVE MY PALM PILOT!!,"My husband just bought me the m130. This is my first palm pilot and I love it!! The color is just awesome and the features are so easy to use!! As soon as the batteries were charged, I started using my palm. I can read my email when I'm on BART and even have access to the internet. I no longer have to get out my phone book to look up a number or an address and I no longer have to carry my appointment book with me. The to do list is very handy. No more stickies everywhere as reminders!! I also love the m130's capability of expanding!!!! I was sold on the Handspring Visor Prism and was going to purchase it when palm came out with the m130. My husband said let's go check out the palm before you buy the Handspring. I'm sure glad we did!! Thank you Palm!!"
4,Great PDA,I bought an m130 a few months ago and find it to be very handy. I can slip my SD memory card into the side and view pictures I took with my digital camera. The color is great too. The only con is that the stylus doesn't always work around the very edges of the screen.
4,The Color Is Great!,"I upgraded from my Palm m100 to the Palm m130 and what a tremendous difference the color makes, it is great! I really didn't use my m100 much because I did not like the dullness of the black & white. I have loaded and organized everything on my m130 including some pictures and even my grocery list. The software that comes with it is great and you can spend a little more and get some great programs to download. My only complaint is that the battery drains much quicker then I thought it would."
4,Warranty Problems,"My Palm M130 is 8 months old and I love it when it works, but I have been trying to get my Palm serviced because the card slot does not want to hold a card anymore, and the cradle is no longer charging the Palm."
1,Defective Palm M130,"Though the M130 has nice features at a more affordable price, I am now very disappointed with my M130. It turned out to be defective when using an expansion card. The unit froze and resetting eventually no longer cleared up the problem. I sent my unit back to Palm and they are taking forever to repair my Palm Pilot. If you buy this machine, make sure to test out the expansion card slot as soon as possible so that if there is a problem you can return it to the store you bought it from. Corresponding with Palm has been frustrating."
5,One of the best purchases I have ever made,"After using my greyscale Visor for about a year I finally decided to upgrade to a color handheld. After much deliberation between the Visor Prism (too bulky and screen is less than to be desired), Clie series...and the PocketPC's...I decided to go with the Palm m130. When it arrived I did a clean Palm desktop install (recommended) and it has worked perfectly since its first HotSync. The smaller screen is not a problem because of its crisp, bright, picture compared to greyscale (and most other color screens). My only complaint is that the bright screen gets a little washed out in direct sunlight. I would recommend this handheld to anyone looking for a high quality handheld for an resonable price..."
3,A big irritation,"I received the palm m130 as a christmas gift. I have been very pleased with the options you have with it, the games you can download, the color, the use, etc. But I have found that if brought into the cold, and in MN is it unavoidable, it will loose all it's information. Reseting it doesn't even work. You have one option, to click ok and everything is gone. It has happened on 3 occasions now. At first I thought it was because the battery level was too low, but that just was not the case.If it wasn't for the ability to hot sync I would have lost every appointment, every telephone number. I did have to go and reload all the games. It has been getting pretty irritating.I can never predict when it is going to happen."
2,Don't Work,Owned a M125 and loved it. The M130 that I received is bug ridden. From the very start it gave me errors syncronizing my data and crashed while installing programs. It would not write data to a Palm 16 MB memory card. I did a hard reset three times and reinstalled the software as many times with only marginal success. Tech support was clueless! They would not concede that I have a defective unit. Therefore I'm returning it and buying a Handspring Prism. I'm very disappointed because I feel this would be a great unit if it worked.
1,Don't buy this!,"I bought this for my wife's birthday. Within 3 months it failed (wouldn't charge). Sent it back to Palm who returned it 'repaired'. Within 1-2 weeks failed again. This happened on a further two occasions before Palm agreed to replace it. Replacement sent last August.... it has just failed again.Furthermore, there were enormous difficulties in acccessing the company for repair services. Palm seem to want to sell these but don't care what happens afterwards."
3,Worked great til it broke,"I used this thing every day for about 4 months when it stopped working. It acted like the battery went out, since it would no longer charge."
1,if you use a mac- don't buy this product,"i own a mac and got the m130 software installed after only a minute or two (literally). but that was on the 9.2 os. i never use that os and always use the x os which palm says its software should work under. however afer spending 5 hours on my own and 2 with a palm tech the sofware would still not work- that is the hotsync function would not work,, which is pretty important. the m130 looks like a great tool- but not for users of the mac osx"
5,One of the Best Palms Ever,This is one of the best Palms ever. It fits into your hand perfectly! Even though The 500 series is flat and portable I would hate to put it into my hand. Plus there is color and you can have almost unlimited memory with memory chips. What more could you want?
5,this is the greatest thing,"I just got mine two days ago. now, loading everything into my computer crashed it several times but otherwise I LOVE IT! I have most of my addresses in there already. I have consolidated all my calendars. I use the to-do list for my business, home business, church and other activities. I have downloaded several books and am now putting in recipes so I can get the groceries I need when at the store, instead of running out at the last minute. I wish there were better helps than the same screen over and over...clearly I've gotten the basics, now advance. but all in all a great item. great price, good rebates! fast shipping - came two days earlier than they said! I love color, so I'm ok with the smaller screen but you might want the 515 if you want a larger screen. only issue, its practically impossible to read my excel docs in here...but I'll keep trying."
3,great 1st buy,"Although I would be lost without my pda, I'm not sure if I would buy this one again. I've had my m130 for less than a year now. From day one I have never like the way it hooks on the hotsync/charger. A few months after getting it, I already had a crack in the plastic case. Now I have a few (really, I DO try to be careful with it). I also bought this figuring I was set for memory as you could use a memory card. The memory card is SLOOOOOOW! I also had my first major crash last month... thank God for hotsync or I'd have lost everything. My next pda will have more memory, a metal case, a higher resolution screen and possibly even mp3 capabilities."
5,Love it! AND I'm a first time PDA user. SIMPLE,"I have found no problems with the Palm M130. I have a hectic schedule as a nursing student AND working nights at the hospital. I find the M130 ideal for storing drug info and the color screen (which is crystal clear) is easy to read even when you've been awake for 24 hours!The Palm was easy to use from the start. I only scanned the manual and immediately starting importing files/ data to it.I set the alarm for appointments and they actually woke me up when I overslept! I do strongly reccommend a case for the item though. I can see that it could be a very fragile piece of equipment. If you are going to be using it in a hospital setting--I would suggest the Palm Glove. It protects from fluids AND shock. Plus, it isn't a bulky case so you can easily carry it in your scrubs pocket.A definate thumbs up!"
3,I recommend the Palm m130 PDA (updated),"I've never owned a PDA before but the Palm m130 is a very nice unit and works well. I use it everyday and think it's a wonderful tool to have around. One thing I really like is the ability to sync my MS Money 2003 (on my computer) with the m130 at a touch of a button...nice! So while on the road I can enter items purchased in the PDA and sync it with my computer when I get home.(update) I didn't realize if your battery was dead for any length of time you'd lose all of your downloaded programs. I had purchased several programs for my PDA on the Internet, downloaded them, used them for some time, but after my Palm sat around the house for a few months without use...poof! they're gone. So keep it charged or say goodbye to your after market software!"
4,I like it-compact and nice bright screen,"I thought my old IIIxe died so I ordered this after reading the reviews here. Only complaint I have is the screen resolution. I think it would have been a 5 star rating except for this. Don't get me wrong the resolution is fine, I wish it could have been just a little bit better. I bought it because of the luck I had with my old one and for price. I guess one has to give up a little to get a good deal, I gave up the resolution to save myself from spending double on a fancier one. Overall I am happy with my purchase and with Amazon.com and their good order entry and tracking system. Once it was shipped I had it in 2 day."
3,Mixed Feelings M130,"I've now had 2 M130s in the last 2 weeks. The first one had to be sent back the day after. It kept locking up and dumping the information. I got my 2nd within 10 days and so far it has now locked up once on the first day. Palm tec support say it may be from a game I downloaded from their site. I will try clearing all the info and starting over. Even with the contract redused, this thing sucks up the battery. If you think you can sit in an airport and work for 2 hours on a doc or spreadsheet, you will not have enough bettery life."
3,Too heavy and thick,"I owned a Palm III for four plus years and was very happy with it. Then my purse was stollen with teh Palm in it and I was forced to update. I read the reviews on the Palm M130 and decided it was fo rme. I ordered it without visiting a store to check out the real thing and I found that it was much thicker and heavier than my Palm III. I keep my Palm in a wallet organzier and I could barely close the wallet with the M130 in it. Therefore, I returned it and I am awaiting my refund. In its place, I purchased the M515 instead. SO far, I am very happy with the 515, especially its width. The only annoying thing about the product is that they have an attractive slip on leather cover but the cover will not stay on the Palm. Otherwise, the software was very easy to install and teh Palm is meeting all of my needs. The color screen is nice and the battery has not worn out yet after one week of use."
3,Good Entry Level Color PDA,"Offers great memory and expansion capability for the price. Color good but not outstanding. Small display but easy to read. Also, comes with a good selection of software for compatibility with Windows applications. (Word, Excel and Outlook.)If you are upgrading from an older Palm the biggest problem is that it does NOT work with previous model of Palm keyboard or 3rd party boards. If you want a portable keyboard you will need to spend another [more money]. Number 2 problem is that the rechargeable battery life is relatively short; 4-5 days on the road just about uses it up. Thus extended periods away from the home cradle will necessitate the purchase of separate charger or 2nd cradle.Overall a good value, and a good entry level color PDA."
3,Decent PDA with all basic features,"I bought this Palm back in December 2002, and so far it has never let me down. Okay, the PDAs standards have developed a lot, but the basic features of this device remain useful: calendar, address book, and the Docs to go.I am now giving thoughts to get an state-of-the-art PDA, but the bad reviews I've read here at Amazon regarding the Tungsten C have make me think about moving to a smartphone, perhaps Sony Eriksson P900..."
4,Great For Students,"I bought this along with the GoType keyboard after getting hand cramps while writing notes in classes. Typing notes beats writing them by a mile! THe PDA has worked flawlessly, and the display is easy to read in room light. It is quite difficult to view in sunlight, but I didn't purchase it for outside use, really. There is so much useful free or inexpensive software available for the Palm OS too! The only downside I can think of is that 16MB of memory would have been much better than 8MB, but there is a firm that will upgrade the PDA to 16MB for $100, so there is hope. Also, the ROM is not flashable, so future OS updates are not possible. Overall, a great value."
2,Mine died!,I bought my Palm M130 less than a year ago and it was great. Then one day it wouldn't turn on. I hit the reset button and it was fine for a few months. Then recently it wouldn't turn on again. I tried resetting it in different ways and no luck. Now i have a dead palm and all my phone numbers and calender info are stuck in my work computer! i wouldn't bother buying this product as i am sure it will die on you too :(
1,tap tap tap,"There seem to be insensitive sections of the diplay, particularly where the 'done' button is, even after using welcome again to re-calibrate. This baby is getting returned today."
1,Low Battery,I ordered a PalmOne and the battery was dead.I returned it and received another. The battery lasts for only a few hours if I am working to add date before it needs to be recharged. My original one had a battery that would last the whole day and more if I wasn't using it. I don't hate anything but I am disappointed in the product that I received.
4,Great product,"Fast speedy delivery. I wish there would have been instructions with it, but luckily they are all pretty much the same! It works great I would recommend it to friends."
3,The case cracks,I loved my first m130 which lasted about a year. When the case I cracked I bought two more for my husband and me. Both of ours cracked after about a year plus the OS is not compatible with XP for syncronizing. Plus I had a lot of problems with getting a recharger that would work or last long for the M130. I have since bought the Zire 22 which I have had for more than 2 years and the case is still intact.
3,Elvis photomosaic 1026 piece puzzle,"This puzzle is difficult, but it can be made much easier if you had an enlarged picture of the completed puzzle to go by. The picture on the box shows just the pictures not the cuts that create the puzzle pieces, which was very helpful in the Marylin Monroe puzzle. There is an enlarged part of one eye which helps get that eye done, because it shows the puzzle pieces. If you know where I can get a picture of the completed puzzle please let me know so I can get one and finish the puzzle. The newer puzzles come with a picture- not the 68' Elvis."
1,"Unless you like frustration, avoid at all cost!","I would not categorize myself as a 'hardcore' puzzler, but I do enjoy putting puzzles together, usually as an after dinner activity with my wife. This puzzle, however, is all frustration, no enjoyment.After nearly two hours of work, my wife and I had the frame complete. We then sat and stared at each other and our sorted pieces, trying to figure out the next step. The puzzle is made up of tiny pictures of Elvis, all of which are in varying shades of black and white. There is very little variety in the photos, so you'll see many repeats as you squint at the pieces. All this to say that there is no context for where the pieces go, in relation to the puzzle as a whole. Other then brute trial and error, I can't see how you would go about putting this together. Even if you finished the puzzle, I really don't see how the process could possibly be fun.Unless you are a glutton for punishment, skip this frustrating puzzle!"
4,Keeps the interest of the Children!,"This book was read in my class, by me to 4 and 5 year olds. They liked the large size and colorful pictures. When the book is over, just flip it over and find out what the moon sees. Two books in one! A great deal."
5,OUTSTANDING,"Every song Anthony plays he puts himself into. Sometimes he does a little mixing & combining of different pieces. I, for one, like the variety he puts in his music. I love his version of Blessed Assurance! Good Bye World & Gloryland Medley are great too. I don't think there's a better pianist."
2,"Not a bad recording, but certainly not Anthony's best.","When I think of Anthony Burger, I think of one of the greatest Gospel piano players of all time. This recording however, mixes classical style beginnings and endings to tried and true Gospel favorites. (What was he thinking???) Sometimes the songs come off very jazzy as well. All in all this CD sounds like a tired lounge act. Only thing missing is Steve and Edie. And, leave the choir at the church. Very out of place here. (Floyd Cramer used to ruin his recordings doing the same thing) On a bright note however, Gloryland Medley IS a sparkler."
5,A BRILLIANT MOMENT in an era of sampling mediocrity(The 90s),"I loved a Girl Like You,but wondered if the album was any good, so i Finally got to hear this cd in a listening station at a big-block type store. The track that hooked me was If You Could Love Me.The brilliance and vocal skills on this track are unmatched.It sounded like a Love Unlimited Orchestra groove with David Bowie on vocals, not alternative at all!! That is what attracts me to artists-when they are unpredictable, and dont play like they look!!!Also extremely great are Low Expectations (a little depressing, but true!)North Of heaven, and Gorgeous george.If you love this cd as much as I do, you also MUST get Bernard Butler- People Move On cd from 1998!!"
4,Buy this album!,"Normally I'm a diehard metal fan.Collins is hardly metal,but his one of a kind tunes can hold their own with most louder artists.Grinding guitars and/or brisk lerics surge through the otherwise mellow masterpieces .All in all,an amazing display of erie,loungy,rock that you'll listen to over and over!"
4,"Not much like A Girl Like You, really","I can just imagine people who've never heard Edwyn being drawn in by the beautifully dumb pop of A Girl Like You and being totally baffled by the intricate, intelligent and dense material that fills this album. ""The Campaign for Real Rock"" and the untitled bonus closing song are actually there to insult you, the listener, and your approach to music. That's what happens when you let smart, talented jerks like Edwyn make music!"
2,Ok at best,"Very dated, with only a few excellent songs. I expected more from this disc, since A Girl Like You is such a great track."
3,Kind of disappointing,"I love Edwyn Collins's voice. It's not like any other. I love all of his songs from Orange Juice, and I adore his one hit from this album, ""A Girl Like You."" However, most of this album is seriously disappointing considering Collins's talent. While the aforementioned track is wonderful, along with the standout ""If You Could Love Me"", most of the songs are just boring (sometimes a little cringeworthy) filler material. I had such high hopes for Gorgeous George and was so excited to get a copy of it, but found Collins instead creating some extremely hackneyed, substandard material. Oh well. At least there's two very good songs in the middle of it all."
4,Excellent Technique Book,"It is not very often that I get wildly excited about computer books, but, well, this one did it! Piemonte and Jamison have compiled a list of tips and techniqes that really help. For example: the book paid for itself immediately by helping me overcome calling a word document directly from Outlook (try to find a readable white paper on that one!).The only reason that I gave it four out of five stars is that some of examples are buggy (I went out to the web site and downloaded the code...which did work and all was well). The code snippets are plentiful and complete. I have a multitude of Outlook and Exchange books and have done several projects to date using both Outlook 98/Outlook 2000 and Exchange Server 5.x. This is now seriously dog eared. If you are doing are going to be doing Outlook programming of any sort get a copy for your library, it is more than worth the purchase price."
1,"Developing Applications Using Outlook 2000, CDO, Exchange","I just received this book for work and have started flipping through it and while I can't atest to all of the data yet, I'm a bit miffed that the entire book is a giant photocopy!!! It's so bad that you can't read the screen print outs they give you and some of the pages are even crooked. I'd even go as far to say that the book was never proofread. I'd say go buy another book, except so far this is the only one I've found that covers the topic I was looking for."
4,Great Radio/Accessories stink,"I enjoy the radio, it's features and useability is very simple. However the belt clip stinks. At least 50% of the reason I purchased was because of the clip. Both clips broke within 3 days of use by two different users. I emailed Motorala and they were non-responsive as to replacement or problem."
1,"May Work For The Movie, But...","There is some good (not great) music on this CD,but the musical styles are various anddon't relate to each other.It is not an enjoyable listeningexperience.A soundtrack/score is expected to havesome sort of cohesion, this has none.It's like a arbitrary music sampler.I listened to it once and have no desireto ever hear it again.If you have warm fuzzy feelings aboutthe film, hard to believe as there isnothing warm and fuzzy about this film,you may like this recording;otherwise, don't bother with it.There are more soundtracks better thanthis one than one could listen to in alifetime."
1,"So boring, So pointless, and such bad music!","The movie itself was enough to drive you over the edge WITH OUT the montonous single piano note always playing in the background. I could not imagine a worse sound track! The movie COULD have been worse but not much. It didn't make sence, it was dragged out and it had numerouse side plots that went nowhere!"
1,Worst CD I've ever heard,"I have not seen the movie so I cannot relate to the music, but, this is by far the worst CD that I have ever heard! The music is so eerie & weird with the exception of just a few songs. Don't waste your money on this...you can have mine."
5,Haunting beautiful music,"All the tracks are beautiful,particulary the piece during the ballroom dancing scene. The piano key sounds throughout the film made things all the more interesting. One of the most beautiful combinations of film and music I have seen in a long time, maybe ever. Loved the soundtrack from film BLUE and THE PIANO too!"
5,GREAT music for a GREAT film!,"Stanley Kubrick's swan song is definitly a history making film. But what many will remeber most, is the fascinating music. The original compositions by Jocelyn Pook are exquisite. ""Masked Ball"" is my favorite on the CD. ""Migrations"" is also excellent if you like the middle-eastern flavor, which I do. ""Baby Did A Bad Bad Thing"", the unofficial theme of EWS, adds a modern zing to an otherwise old-sounding disc. I have had this since Friday and have listened to nothing else. It's actually playing right now. With the incessant banging of ""Musica Ricercata II"", the moans and chants of ""Masked Ball"", the Arabian chords of ""Migrations"" and the jazzy flavor of ""Strangers in the Night"", EWS Soundtrack proves to be one of the best musical compilations from a Kubrick since A CLOCKWORK ORANGE."
3,Great music for a not so good film,"""Eyes Wide Shut"", Stanley Kubrick's last work, was described before its theatrical release as a ""sexual thriller"". After seeing the movie one will realize that such category does not exist, being an irregular combination of drama (= infidelity), suspense (= muder) and horror (= secret societies), which can be heard in the soundtrack. In other words, the CD is a collection of fine music, apparently extracted from different films, sharing the movie's ""multiple personality"". ""Musica Ricercata, II"", ""Waltz 2 from Jazz Suite"", ""Baby Did A Bad Bad Thing"" and ""Masked Ball"" are perfect examples. György Ligeti's and Jocelyn Pook's music, however, are reason enough to add this CD to your collection. ""Musica Ricarcata, II"" despite its simplicity, or because of it (do you remember the strings-only score for ""Psycho""?), is perhaps the most disturbing theme in years. ""Masked Ball"" is also creepy. I haven't heard anything so sinister since ""The Omen""."
5,A GREAT CD OF VARIOUS MUSIC,"This is my favorite Kubrick movie save for 2012. Some say I'm crazy but I thought Cruise and Kidman were phenomenal giving performances that will stand the test of time, and the music with this movie makes it even more outstanding and strange. Some of the music on this CD is among my very favorite. Jocelyn Ppok for example. The CD is like a musical journey and certain tracks completely stand out. Yet everything on here is great, reminds you of certain scenes in the movie. Couldn't have the movie without the soundtrack on this one. Just love this film and soundtrack."
4,STRANGE...BUT GOOD,"I really liked this soundtrack; I thought it complemented the film very well. I particularly enjoyed the Shostakovich waltz and the Liszt ""Grey Cloud"" piece. However, the Jocelyn Pook music was a little to wierd for me. ""Naval Officer"" was the only track I liked, the rest were a little freaky. I've never been a fan of Gyorgy Ligeti either, and his hollow piano piece, which is the first and last track,didn't impress me at all. However, I really enjoyed listening to this CD, and will gladly add it to my collection of other Kubrick soundtracks."
2,Of Potential Lost,"Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece of a film, with subtle and not-so-subtle hints of film noir was utterly destroyed with its transformation into a soundtrack. While possibly playing with the masses in mind, it has resulted in an overhyped mix of undulating dischord and disharmony. One might compare it a Mel Gibson ""flick"" in its nascent impracticality to adhere to its ideal."
3,More Jocelyn Pook Please,"I bought this CD only because I heard a piece from the album by Jocelyn Pook on a New York classical radio station that simply floored me. Ms. Pook's music is extraordinary but this is the only CD her music appears on apparently. The three stars is for her. If the entire album consisted of her music only, the CD would have received 5 stars from me. However, the schmaltzy versions of ""When I Fall in Love,"" and ""Strangers in the Night,"" are enormous distractions. Chris Isaak's, ""Baby Did A Bad Bad Thing"" is quite wonderful, but this is Jocelyn Pook's show all the way. Hopefully, a CD of her music will be forthcoming shortly? Please?"
3,"Great movie, so-so soundtrack","I was fascinated by this film -- and thus picked up this soundtrack. (I don't normally buy soundtracks, but the haunting score compelled me to do so...) All-in-all, this is a good collection but I was sorely disappointed that the CD includes a shorter version of Jocelyn Pook's wonderful ""Masked Ball"" song...you know, the song they played during the orgy. It seems like the soundtrack version is edited down to 3 minutes -- which is a shame. I bought the CD specifically for this song and was, thus, disappointed."
5,Excellent as was expected!,"Classical music will always seem to have a sort of edge to it when played over something spooky ou haunting. This movie was both of those plus being tramatic, thought provoking and highly erotic and the music complimented those beautifully. Chris Issacs ""Baby did a bad, bad thing"" was featured in the commercials and the trailer and was only played once during the movie, not a bad song thought. Dominic Harlans ""Ricercato II"" was a fantastic choice for the ever increasing interest and panic during the masked ball. The way the tempo increased could have been the same as Tom's heartrate increasing as he walked around that freak show. Nevertheless, don't listen to the one star giving people, they were never Stanley, Nicole or Tom fans to begin with. I'd really like to know what they thought should have been played. Something a little more Dawson Creekish? I think not."
4,Make yourself a Martini,"This is a spooky and moving soudtrack. The schmatlzy tunes are creepy in context and Listz's 'Grey Clouds' has a feeling of sensual dread. Though Ligeti's nerve jangling 'Musica Ricerata' frames the album I think the centerpiece is Oscar Levant's 'Blame It On My Youth', an subdued ode to the folly of desire. Classic Kubrick irony is also on display with the Shostakovich Waltz tune. This film and soundtrack makes a nice double feature to that other cinematic rumination on marriage, fidelity, and sexuality: David Lynch's 'Lost Highway'."
5,Kubrick has done it again!,"I am an avid admirer of the late Mr.Kubrick, and one thing his movies never fail to do is astound me with their stunning visuals, and their brilliant soundtracks. The all too eclectic choices of classical, jazz & blues, and experimental, all work together to make a paradoxical masterpiece of sound. From Gyorgy Ligeti to Dmitri Shostakovich to Chris Isaak, these blatantly different, and almost contradictory styles of music at no one point undermine each other, but rather enhance each other and play off each other's melodic beauties.Truly a marvel of motion picture soundtracks."
5,Extraordinary!!,"One of the most hauntingly beautiful soundtracks I've ever heard!-- Just like Kubrick's wonderful film!! Once again Kubrick demonstrates an impeccable intelligence in his choice of music, so much so that image and sound blend into a whole mesmerizing experience!! I'm so grateful he lived to complete his final work--WHAT A LEGACY!!!"
4,Haunting...dark...eerie...perfect rainy day weather music!,"Ok, I will admit I was one of the FEW people who went and saw this movie the day it opened. And, Ok, I'll admit it, I kind of liked it. But you know what really caught my attention? No, it was not the nudity, the controversy, the director, or the costumes (or lack thereof), it was the music.From the jamming of Chris Isaak's Baby Did a Bad Bad Thing (in my opinion one of the greatest crooners of his time!) to the haunting first few seconds of the soundtrack. Those piano keys just seem to echo throughout the land. Track 2 is one of those sweeping overtures that reminds you just how sensational classical music can be.The CD revolves around classical numbers splashed with a bit of darkness. The haunting melodies create visual pictures in your head that seem to linger.This is definitely an album that you can sit down to and listen to on a rainy day. Lay back, fasten your seat belts, its going to be a bumpy ride!"
4,Great read,"I'm about 6 stories in and so far, it's great. I picked up both Girls Night In and Girls Night Out in hopes of finding more authors to read, and I've definitely found them! I can't wait to finish both books!"
3,Girls' Night Out,"A host of authors have come together to produce another anthology benefitting Operation War Child. This alone makes the book worth purchasing. Beyond that, several of the entries are truly enjoyable. Dog Lover will definitely give you more than one chuckle, while Wishing Carefully or A Thing of Beauty will give you smiles of a more profound nature. There are some stories that just won't be for you, but the few gems and the good cause combined should make this one to think about.Amanda Killgore"
2,Week strength of strings,"Strings sound good, but the second string (B) simply broke after two days of playing. I have 10 years experience of playing so this is not because of lack of skills."
5,"Feel (almost) like regular strings, last forever, stay stable... what more could I ask for?","I loved the longevity and stability of Elixir's polyweb strings, but they always felt too ""oily"" and not quite bright enough for my tastes. I recently tried a set of Nanoweb Elixirs (I've been playing D'Addario nickels for a while) and I loved them! The tuning was stable within a couple minutes; they feel like regular strings, and have more bounce and zing than the polywebs. I highly recommend the nanowebs if you find the polywebs too mellow or weird-feeling."
4,Excellent for the basics,"I used this book in college and it was great for teaching you the basics of HVAC systems and how they work. I am now trying to re-buy it, since I stupidly sold it back to the bookstore for much needed end of semester money."
5,Woah!!!!!!!!!,"If you can imagine Brian Eno and Isao Tomita conspiring together to create a mixed-media installation of interactive Frippertronics, this is what it would be.Amazing.The musical samples are superb and the interface is so simple that non-musician octagenarians can immediately create tunes like Eno or George Winston.Thank you, Toshio Iwai. You are a sublime genius.The modes that let you mutate your recorded voice and do loops with insane sound effects from old NES games are pretty fun, but there is some real depth and beauty in this software.If you're a musician, artist, technogeek or Japanophile, check it out."
4,a peaceful game,"It's the kind of 'game' that you pick up when you're really bored, or just feeling the urge to be creative. However, the novelty wears off quickly, and the lack of ability to save your creations is a major drawback. It is pretty soothing, though."
5,THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!,"Electroplankton is proboly the best game ever. I dont have it yet, but my friend has it and im addicted. Im 10, and ive been into music for 6 years. I hate my piano lessons, but i love my cello lessons. My favorite plankton is hananbow, but I also like nanocarp and lumninloop."
4,Music to my ears,"Very fun game, if you can call it that. Hours of entertainment, but can get a little boring if you play it for TOO long. Requires little skill, fun for anyone, just don't look for a point, there isn't one!"
2,Great graphics...,"This is not really a game. You don't have a goal you're trying to achieving and you're definitely not tryng to break any records. You're supposed to groove to the music that you and the electroplanktons are making together. I bought this because I thought I could make interesting music with it while I'm away from my piano but...it's much more simplistic and in my opnion, it's for people who don't have any musical background at all. I found it un-fun and actually frustrating because it seems I'm just peicing pre-programmed sound bytes together and not really creating anything truly my own. Alas! Oh but the graphics ARE SUPER CUTE."
4,ElektroplanktonDS,What I like best about the game is Volvoice. It is fun because you can record any sound and distort it any way you want.
3,Whats Up with the PRICE GOUGING???,I thought this game would be cute to get and let my toddler play around with since she cant play anyway - But with people SCALPING it to the highest bidder I guess I'll never know how bad or good this game is for younger kids. I really hate when a company releases something like this for known PIRATES to horde. That is all the good that comes of it. I hope a company person reads this and will do something about it - PLEASE. For the sincere gamers who have kids.
4,Electroplankton is more of a toy than a game,"If you're looking to buy this, realize that Electroplankton isn't so much of a game as it is a DS toy. Only a few levels offer music based puzzles, while the rest are music based toys. While relaxing and enjoyable, this game doesn't have a long lasting appeal. I found myself getting bored with it after about 2 weeks."
3,NDS Electroplankton,"THIS IS NOT A GAME.It's a fun way to experience musical notes with the stylus. I was interested in this because it uses some of the other features on the NDS that are not used in most games.You use the stylus to move the Electroplankton or the items they strike to change the sounds you hear.I like the unusual for my DS. I find it relaxing.If you are a true gamer who likes lots of action, this is not for you."
4,"This therapeutic R&R SPACE WILL INVOKE WONDER in the very young or very old, as one pieces together sound/graphic loops & see...","One gets transported in this game to a therapeutic R&R; SPACE where one gets to CREATE music with graphics by piecing together sound/graphic loops (like a music mosaic) and then WATCH & be mesmerised by your handiwork and the soothing sights & sounds... very new age-y. Will invoke wonder for the very young or very very old. Great stimulation. All those in between will find it rather fascinating as well...just that there are other things to do....bubbling brooks, bubbles popping, soothing tunes. Enjoy."
4,Not a Game - This is Art,"Electroplankton is not a game at all, but it is very fun and can keep your attention like (or better than in my case) a game. The prices that rip off artists are trying to charge is ridiculous, though. You might be able to find a more reasonable price at a -ahem- online auction (wink, wink). I would really like to see this re-released and/or released for the Wii. I think the market would be better now, since the DS and DS Lite were originally aimed more at pre-teens. My wife and I both have DS's and find many titles entertaining and helpful (Brain Age, etc...). I think the musical capabilities far exceed Wii Music (which I also like)."
3,Filling a niche not everyone asked for.,"This is a cool little rhythm-based piece of art. It's fun, and entertaining, and it makes you smile. But, unlike its competition (other DS games), it lacks in replay value. If you're the type of person who could be endlessly entertained by something like this, buy it. If the price doesn't severely cut into your game budget, this title makes a great 4th or 5th title. If you like strange novelties originating from Japan, this is one of them. But if you're deciding on the top 3 or 4 games for the DS, I have to steer you away from this. It's a great addition to a collection, but a poor starting point."
5,Wonderful!,"My son just turned three and he got this as a birthday present. Harold makes a great addition to the Lego Thomas sets or he would be great on his own. The pieces are the perfect size for preschoolers' hands and they snap together easily. My son enjoys putting Harold together and loading cargo with the pully.A fan of all things Thomas AND of anything with propellers, my son plays with Harold for hours. This toy encourages imaginative play and works well with other Duplo blocks. It's sturdy and fun. Highly recommended!"
2,Not worth the money,I didn't think that 4 pieces was worth $16. My nephew liked the toy but was bored with it quickly.
2,cat nip,"I was disappointed with this brochure secondary to the scant amount of cinical information that I expected to receive about cat care. I'm sure this publication would be fine for someone other than ""a novice"" cat owner."
1,Horrible waste of money,"The claim is that the batteries can last up to 70 hours - I only listen to an hour or two of music on it a day, and I end up changing the batteries about every week. When you want to pause the song and skip forward or backward into it, you would think you would have control over where it goes, right? Nope, it will automatically shuffle to a random point on that track or it'll just skip forward to the next track. I dropped it once but it was only from 2 feet onto a carpet, parts broke off that I had to put back together.Don't buy this, please. I'm sorry that I did."
4,Pretty Good Overall..,"This is one of the best cd players out there, besides the Sony Discman. The bass is good, and the sound quality is basically mediocre.I didnt like the original headphones that came with this, so I use a older pair of the same pair I bought at Hudsons Treasure hUnt lol! It plays all cds, even burned ones so you wont have any problems with that feature. Sometimes I wish It would get louder even though I have some really good headphones. And the battery life lasts me weeks I dont know what everyone else is talking about."
2,Instructions/more thought needed,"Ordered this to put in my pocket while I'm walking; however should warmer weather come, a simple clip on the back to attach to clothing would (to me) make sense. Not many people walk/jog holding the CD player in their hands, and a clip would have eliminated the need for buying a special holder.I would have found instructions included very helpful. Kept getting ""hold"" message until I found switch that was on the side, not on the top.Headphones are beyond useless - just used the ones from my old diskman. May fit an elf - sure didn't fit me!Sound is fine - I don't expect top of the line in something like this, but find it adequate and enjoyable while on my daily walk."
4,OK,"Product worked for the fist few weeks, the it stopped working... the switch that detected if the lid was closed did not work correctly, however a rubber-band seemed to fix the problem"
3,Not bad for the price,"Let me preface this review by saying this is my first review and I'm a beginner at the subject of Aikido. That said, this product is okay for the price, but essentially your paying for demonstrations with little to no elucidation. I would hope that my poor grasp of the concepts presented is due to the esoteric nature of the content; however, seeing that the emphasis is on presenting these secret aspects of Aikido Lovret Sensei stops short. It is my hope that within a few years or more I can review this again with more optimism and better criticism. Certainly not a foundational or introductory dvd."
5,"Excellent, unbiased, factual. Puts a face on the 'why'.","Where did these overgrown vegetables come from?Grapes? American Apples? What are they doing in the Jamaican marketplace? Why would a lush country as Jamaica import potatos, onions, carrots from the USA?I saw the effects of the WTO on Jamaica from pre-teen to now my young adult years, but I never really understood all the why's. All Jamaicans and peoples affected or unnafected by the World Trade Organisation should watch. I watched it with a friend from India and he was amazed - as this agri-colonialism is what India is currently fighting in the WTO. I especially liked the commentary from the Rastafarian/Biblical points of view. And of course, the soundtrack is great - Buju B goes accapella!"
5,Doggie Favorite,"Based on my dogs' reactions to this treat, I almost want to chew on it myself! They last forever, are safe for even the most aggressive chewers, and seem to hold their appeal long after the ""good stuff"" has been gnawed away."
3,Dog liked it at first,"Ok, I actually don't think I received this bone right. When I got it there was nothing inside, it was just hollow and judging from the picture it's supposed to be stuffed. I actually did find this at my pet store today and they were all stuffed as well while mine was hollow.Anyway, my dog loved this for a day and now I have to get him excited or smear peanut butter inside of it to get him to eat the bone. It seems very durable and like I said, I think I got a dud. I'm sure he would have spent days or weeks on it if hadn't been hollow. I'll stick to buying this at my pet store.So I'll give this a 3 star and I'll give it another shot and update my review."
3,Its ok but I wouldnt buy again,"I read reviews saying the bone lasted their big dogs quite some time. I just receive the bones 2 days ago, and with in the 2 days my dogs had them completely cleaned out and bare. I have two very tiny Shih Tzu mix dogs. No where near big dogs. I'm very disappointed how fast they went through 2 bones. The delivery was very fast that's why I'm rating it a 3 star otherwise I would give it a 2."
2,bone,"My dog, a beagle, hated this bone..she was afraid of it..and she chews many a bone. I did not realize that there would be ""grizzle"" on the bone and to tell you the truth I was a bit grossed out! Ended up throwing it away."
1,I really don't like it,My four year old begged me to buy him power rangers....and i bought two of these and I was really disappointed. They are all in peices now. I didn't know that ever body part came apart to you can do whatever you want with them. I think my son would have perferred an action figure that didn't come apart while he was playing with it as what it should be intended to do.
3,Zojirushi EB-CC15 indoor electric grill: Initial thoughts,"Thought i was upgrading from my 6 year old Delonghi grill. This one is easier to clean, and that's about it. Not bad, but not the best either"
2,bleh.....,"Received it today and am not to impressed with it.Did beef kebobs and the cooking was so uneven that some some pieces were cooked dry while others were pretty raw.For me a waste of money, since it does no better than my other grill, which does just as poor of a job."
2,Zojirushi indoor grill,"This grill was chosen on the star rating system instead of the experience of a friend who had a competing model, which I can now understand is better, and less expensive. Cleaning is not easy and don't ever grill fish inside."
1,Chinese Made,"Chinese made.... For some reason I though it was Japanese made ""sigh"" but no is a Chinese made crap, I return it. Oh yeah I took it out of the box and yes it feels really cheap."
5,excellent,"Tried this grill out tonight to make hamburgers and was impressed. One thing that I quickly noticed was when I flipped the hamburgers there were very bold grill marks on each burger something that my out door grill doesn't do nearly as well. The high temp setting works great. I was a little skeptical at first after reading false reviews about its heating capabilities but after watching those burgers sizzle squashed that doubt. It doesn't give that out door barbecue taste but that is to be expected seeing as you wont be using charcoal or anything else to give it that taste, not that kind of grille. One thing for sure and that is you'll leave the frying pan alone (yuck) and use this instead."
2,No good for me,"I ordered this product, opened it and sent it right back. It is much to small for a family. It might work for 1-2 people. I couldn't see it big enough for two medium sized steaks."
4,"A little pricey, but worth it","This is an excellent product. The build quality is superb, the non-stick works well and seems durable, and it's not too big. It's a little expensive, and smokes more than I expected, but it beats a George Foreman grill hands-down. Food doesn't come off tasting like it came from a real grill, but you could do worse."
2,Save Your Money,I purchased this grill because I wanted a grill to use inside and also wanted a grill with a thermostat. The cooking grid area is very small and the grill is hard to clean since the heating coils are part of the grid and you cannot immerse it in water. If you have it turned up past medium it burns everything.
5,Zojirushi Indoor Electric Grill,We moved into a senior apartment complex which does not allow outdoor grills of any sort. This seemed like the perfect solution and it is. Great brand and does a really first class job - just be sure to turn place on your stove and turn on your fan otherwise smoke alarms will sound.
3,Not as good as I thought,"this unit advertised as non smoke grill.but when I grill steak in my condo, it triggered my smoke detector twice."
4,LOVE THE GRILL......,We love the grill with one exception. Instructions say to grill on High for chicken etc. It really spits grease on High. I guess I will have crank it down a bit. Otherwise it's great.
3,Great product,Great indoor grill. Takes a while to heat up and cook but it is better then bq in the snow.
3,but not easily readable with markings,"I have owned several indoor grills. I purchased this one based upon the price and reviews. I am not impressed. The thermostat is helpful, but not easily readable with markings. The grill does heat up evenly across the cooking surface."
5,I love this grill!,"I bought this for my husband, and he loves it! We grilled steak tips, and they came out perfect - just as though we had broiled them on our gas grill. Even better, it's very easy to clean!"
5,Excellent,"Pros:- non-stick surface makes it extremely easy to clean. Charred food debris just slides off the surface.- base of the unit is made of plastic and acts as an insulator so there is no need to put anything under it to protect your tabletop.- safety mechanism built in so that grill cannot be operated without drip pan.- takes only 10 minutes to heat up fully.- grill is a heavy cast iron so holds heat well. I have seen other similar grills by companies like Sanyo and only Zojurushi uses a heavy cast iron grill.- heats very well. Grills meat very fast.- no smoke generated- not sure why, but there just isn't any.Cons:- none so far.Notes:- if you want to grill vegetables, I'd recommend coating them with some oil before putting them on the grill, otherwise the veges tend to get dry.- power cable is short, so make sure you have an extension cable handy."
5,FOLLOW UP NOTE.,"We continue to be pleased with this grill and we have noticed one additional benefit over the built in grill we had used previously: there is almost no smoke at all when we grill on the Zoji.No matter how well we cleaned our previous grill, cooking 4 steaks would leave a lingering odor in the kitchen for a day. We had even looked into a roof-mounted extractor fan to assist the hood-mounted unit. Happily, we have no smoke problem anymore!"
4,Very good for what it is,"I purchased this grill in October, 2011, and have used it frequently. You cannot compare it to a charcoal grill in temp and speed of cooking, but you shouldn't. It does a very good job for a small electric grill. It does smoke some depending upon what you are cooking, but I use it next to an open window or on the stove top under the vent hood with no problems. You can buy a Kenyon Custom electric indoor grill with a 1300 watt burner for $1,000 or you can buy this grill with a 1300 watt burner for $75. Seems to me that each will put out the same amount of heat."
4,Happy so far,i purchased a few weeks ago. So far I have been pleased. Heats up very quickly. High setting is plenty hot to sear your food. Non-stick surface works great. Adjustable temp works well. Very little smoke and is easy to clean.
5,just awsome,"I have bought many things off amazon and have been generally happy, althought i never wrote a review for anything. However this machine deserves a review. Simply put this thing is awsome. I have used it for chicken steaks and fish and everytime it does a great job. the food comes out so good. i highly recomend it.the only problem with it is the base could of been made out of some metal instead of plastic.best indoor grill."
2,Sadly disappointed,"I had high hopes for this grill. After all, I love my Zo bread machine. However, I don't love this grill. The good points are that it cooks a decent steak or burger. The BAD points are that it smokes horribly, is very difficult and messy to clean and takes forever to heat up. If you really want one of these, look for mine soon at a Goodwill near you!"
5,Perfect!!!!,"Whatever you put on this thing turns out great. Chicken, steak, fish, veggies, etc. And it's very easy to clean!!!"
4,Zojirushi EB-CC15 Indoor Electric Grill,"The grill does a perfect job to please my epicurean palate. I use a corning ware clear glass lid to produce a high temperature on the grill. My only complaint - the frame for holding the grill is plastic, so don't place near a stove top gas range burner (at least 6"" away)."
4,not bad for inside grill,"I have used the grill a couple of times so far and it works well. cleaning is pretty easy, so good if u you not want to grill outside."
4,cooks good for an indoor grill.,It heats up quick. Cook's really good as long as you aren't trying to cook something thick. I believe this is because it has only direct heat from the grill top. Pair it with a toaster oven and you can cook a great steak. Or anything else for that matter.
5,Buy once cry once,"Don't waste your time for any other bipod than a Harris. Besides the big guys like a Parker Hale, Harris is going to be your best quality, function, and price. I wish I would've got the swivel model, but that was my dumb choice as a buyer. The fixed works just fine, and the notched legs are very convenient."
2,Boredom in the Forest,"This was a great idea for a book, clever devil, secretly lurking among mortals with an inside scoop into Adolph Hitlers genesis and his formative years. Adolf was identified as a person with great promise and was nurtured and guided by the narrating devil. Unfortunately Mailer weighs the story down with too lenghty digressions into irrelevant, parrallel story lines. He chose to insert just plain old nasty homo-pedophiliac themes that have no place in the book, don't add to it other than to inject a curiously detailed description of the same. Enough about the MF bees already, we get it. He likes bees. Too bad Mailer lost the opportunity to explore historical characters from the era with his obsession on tedious detail. DO NOT BUY."
3,The Hitler Family's penchant for incest started it all...,"No doubt this book engages anyone interested in history and people who wonder what caused the little Austrian to do what he did. It offers a possible/plausible version of what little Adolph's life was like and is told in a unique way. It is crude and disturbing, but the content and ideas presented in this book stick with you well beyond completing the account. In that respect, it's a value!"
3,Incomplete,"I thought Mailer did great job fleshing out his characters, but he did not complete their respective journeys. In the end, this left me unsated. Great prose, but not original in concept."
1,Mailer's Muse- Deiter!?!?!,This is a purely scatological romp through Freud's scheme of childhood development. I made it almost to the end until Mailer etched in a pedophilic unzipping- wow what a surprise! I should have expected it. After that I did not want to know the ending or rather I already knew- Hitler was evil- surprise!!Move over Gunter Grass ( pen name: porno-Grass) you have been bested in the disgusting genre of slasher kuka. Simply because a writer can create a good sentence does NOT by association make him or her a great artist. And this festering mound of words is the leit motif for such venal and crass art.This book seldom gives you time to breath before the next scene offends your senses. The pages almost literally drip with a putrid ooze that can hurt you- caveat emptor!!!
2,Unless you are completing your collection,"Don't expect much from this one. The story has little to recommend it. I read it because it was Mailer. Like other old masters, their best work was a while back."
4,Mailer is Back!,With his best book since the NAKED AND THE DEAD- No one can accuse him of not being experimental & this his best experiment yet- on a level with the SOUND & THE FURY & much easier to read.
1,Don't bother,"I wasted a couple of evenings plowing through this simply awful book. Awful not just for the subject matter but because it is so poorly written, clumsy and ridiculous. It's Mailer's self-indulgence at its worst."
2,What was this about?,"This was my first Mailer novel, and from what I've read - both between the covers of the book as well as the reviews here on Amazon - I chose poorly.We're led to believe this is a story of Hitler's formative years. When you look at the bibliography, it seems Mailer intended (and produced) something of a historical fiction. However, while we see much of Hitler's ancestors (particularly his father and his difficulties with the zipper), and a little of the young ""Adi"", it almost seems to me this is more of an musing on the workings of good and evil - God and the Devil, from the Devil's perspective - with an infamous product of this struggle as context.If I were to Twitter a riddle regarding Castle in the Forest, I might write, ""What do you get when you cross The Rolling Stones (Sympathy for the Devil), Freud and Oedipus Rex?"""
2,The Banality of The Castle in the Forest,"There is something extremely plodding about this book, which truly surprised me. A novel, narrated by an underling demon, tracing the development of the evil that animated Adolf Hitler sounds like a fascinating, delicious premise. Instead, it is the framework for banal insights about Hitler's mundane Freudian hang-ups. Even the demon underling assigned to his ""case"" does little more than observe the small, sneaky, cold-hearted kid grow up.But, in the end, what special ingredient the demons may have mixed in with the banality of Hitler's congenital evil to create the extraordinary evil of the mature Hitler isn't addressed.Perhaps that's the point. There is no explanation. But it was frustrating to continue reading, reading, reading in hopes of coming upon a kernel of fresh insight that isn't there."
2,The makings of a monster,"Mailer gives us an early childhood scenario of Hitler, a description of his surroundings and a look into his moldings of becoming a monster. His family is described as well. the problem with this book is that I never really felt the growth of this demon dictator. maybe it was written in such nuance that escaped me but I wanted to more vivdly paint a picture ofr me. It didnt."
2,Not What I Expected,"As a work of fiction this is a fine book. Mailer is a great writer and as I don't think this was one of his finest works, it was still an enjoyable read. What I was a bit irked by was the lack of focus on what I thought was going to be the central plot of the novel - Adolf Hitler's childhood. This was a book about his father Alois mostly. It detailed Alois' childhood, relationships, work, children, retirement and death. As soon as he died there was 20 pages left in the book. Yes, you can say that we can gain some sort of insight into Adolf's life indirectly by seeing what a person his father was but this is not very complete. My expectation was that you would see sections of his father throughout his life, sections of his school friends, deep traumatic experiences and what inevitably started him down the road of politics. The ending of this book left me feeling very incomplete, almost as if there was a second volume somewhere that I forgot to purchase."
2,Don't expect to find Hitler in these pages.,"This is a strangely disappointing book. I guess I expected some clear connection with Adolf Hitler, some bit of evidence or conjecture that would make the man more of a creature like us. Instead, Mailer has seized on the old rumors about his family, his father, incest, and has drawn a picture that suggests the damage Hitler may (must) have suffered as a child. It is in short Mailer's imagination we are dealing with here, and his alone. There is nothing here for the historian, and perhaps that was my mistake. I was thinking historical fiction when I began reading it. There is virtually nothing of history present in the work. And worse, we learn nothing new about Hitler. A disappointment."
3,Castle in The Forest,Received promptly and in described condition. I'm glad to have this book on hand as it is not one that I will complete in the time frame offered by the library. Thanks
4,It's better than they say it is,"This collection of Esquivel's christmas music is NOT a cheap, thrown together affair. Some of the compositions are a little more traditional, but listen to Frosty the Snowman and the track right after it- Pure lounge, quality music.I give it two thumbs up."
2,Poor Fit and function,"As one of the previous reviewers has already mentioned, this carrying case does not fit the phone well. My biggest complaint is that the velcro on the top does not completely hold down the covering side, which leaves a little lip, which gets caught on things.Also, the hole near the bottom (which should be the opening for the microphone) does not line up with the microphone hole.By the way, at least on the case I bought, the sides ARE elastic!For $ you would think that they could make something a little better."
3,it looks just like the original part,Once I receive this I believe that it will fit the exact need I have for the product
1,Avoid this release (Miracle Pictures),"This review pertains to the Miracle Pictures release. I picked it up for $2 in an Ethiopian-owned tobacco shop, figuring ""What the heck. For two bucks, if it stinks, I'll just toss it."" And that is exactly what I did. The print is horrible. The green banding through the middle of the screen rendered the DVD unwatchable. It hit the trash bin less than 5 minutes in. Sorry to soil my local land fill with such garbage. The distributor, Miracle, doesn't even print their name on the package. What does that tell you?I still haven't seen Strange Love... But I've got the Paramount release in my wish list, and I look forward to a much better print when I eventually do get it."
1,Most Poorly Written Book I've Read in Years,"It was torture to get through this book. The sentence structure was headache inducing. There was no character development, just page after page describing the freezing cold weather."
2,Not a materpiece,A great idea suprisingly poorly written. Good humour used is its saving grace. To abuse a much used phrase that decribes the slow and painfull way in which the story moves : <cattle>!!
3,Tough!,"This 3-D puzzle is a challange even for adults. We spent several evenings working on this, and wound up with a smattering of leftover mystery pieces at the end. The instructions and illustrations are not clear; you can see some parts of the puzzle in the pictures on the box, but not all. The dome is especially tricky. The puzzle pieces are made of foam and not very durable; I feel that when we take the puzzle apart, some pieces are likely to break and bend and it will not be possible to put it together perfectly again. It is more of a one-time activity. The finished result looks good- similar to the picture on the box. Kids might like to glue it together to keep as a trophy."
4,Don't buy used,I would not risk buying this item used like I did. It had a missing piece. It was not that important of a piece. But to get the full effect of the puzzle you really need all the pieces.
4,Refreshingly different and very funny!,"This is a book unlike any other I have ever read... in a good way. The author clearly has a very unique and appealing sense of humor.Jim, the main character, is a very eccentric fellow who lives in a school bus, and the book chronicles the details of his daily life. Be warned, the humor is very dry and off-the-wall and probably isn't for everybody. But if you like movies such as Napoleon Dynamite, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and The Royal Tenenbaums there's a very good chance you'll like this book. That's not to say that this book is exactly like those movies, but I'd say its in the same ballpark... I know I enjoyed it."
5,"A must have! Lloyd is as Lloyd does, wonderfully!","Lloyd Gregory has shown tremendous artistry over the past few years. His Solo Guitar CD is one I set my alarm clock to. There is nothing like waking up to the sound of a smooth tune while getting ready for the day. I love the new CD and will always be a friend and fan. Please take time to purchase this CD and add it to your collection of must haves. When music is in your soul, you have no other choice but to love Lloyd's new CD. Thanks for the opportunity to become a friend in your circle, Lloyd! You are a wonderful person and a wonderful guitarist! Much love and success to you!"
3,Other songs,Sorry with the exception of a couple of songs in this CD I feel disapointed. I would have prefer to get some of the classical neapolitan songs. Griggolo has a beautiful voice and I would enjoy it even more with the old tunes though new ones could be included but in a minority.
4,Vittorio,I just adore Italian singers and found Vittorio a year ago. His voice is higher and delicate and hecomposes this songs with a contemporary twist using electric guitar at times. I would not consider him a classical-type singer. I also love Alessandro Safina who has a lower more powerful voice. I recommend Vittorio's CD as it has 3-4 English sung songs which showcases his voice in a slightly different way.
4,Soothing album,"I first watched Vittorio perform at Miss Universe 2006 competition. He sang Cosi (Bedshaped), a song I knew as Keane's. Vittorio gave an effortless graceful performance though I am not a big fan of the hair :) Bottomline is that the voice was just incredible and that's what matters.Then I got the CD and I just played it everyday. I love every song in the album. No complaints there. I just hope that in the next album, Vittorio will have more varied song choice to better showcase his talents."
5,Kdb,"I purchased this on a whim after listening a little. I had no idea how much joy it would bring. It is truly a romantic CD! I love the song You are My Miracle, and every song on this CD is lovely. The background orchestration is exquisite!"
5,best so far,"I've read the reviews that compare Vittorio to Groban and Bocelli. Although Groban is in his own space in the US, he is not in the same league. His voice will never be on that level. I've loved Bocelli since 1999 when I went to his concert at the Hollywood Bowl. I've always felt he was the best in terms of pop/italian/opera mix singer, but there was always something missing from his voice. I did not know what until I heard Vittorio sing Tu Sei. I've always believed that the song makes the singer and that if the singer did enough with the song to make it his own, he will deserve the praise. Vittorio has done that with Tu Sei. His voice is powerful with the right mix of talent and softness. I'm going to look forward to his future CDs and I hope he continues to pick the right songs to sing."
5,"Bought this for ""Tu Sei"", Keep Listening for the Others","A true opera singer, Vittorio also does a lovely job with ""pop"" music. This is not your Josh Groban. The voice is true Italian, the music divine. Although Tu Sei is still my favorite, five years later I have the CD on my IPod under Favorite Tunes. Tremendous compliation by an extraordinary singer."
5,Music that warms the soul,"I absolutely LOVE THIS CD. He reminds me a lot of another great tenor, Mario Frangoulis. If you have not heard his music, you need to. Both of these CD's would make a wonderful Christmas gift!!! I can not stop listening. My 3 year old son has developmental delays, and when I can not calm him down--this music always does."
2,OK,Not too bad in taste but haven't found the right cake to put it on. It's really hard to find GF products that are easy and taste good.
1,Danco Diverter Spout,"I had the same experiece ""Damham"" had. I also bought this item at a home improvement store. The diverter leaked so bad out the back and into the wall it was dripping into the basement. It's just a cheap plastic piece of junk. Don't bother."
3,Tricky to install,"I recently installed two of these on 1/2"" slip fit copper pipes and both took me a couple hours to install properly. I also needed extra plumbing tape for both... Make sure you buy extra tape! The only way I could get the plastic connection into the spout to seal properly was to wrap the tape around the plastic with extra tape hanging off the front. From there, I was able to tighten the spout enough so that the spout and tape created a good compression fitting. I tried another brand universal tub spout in the process and could not get that one to work at all and ended up with flooding in my house. This was the best replacement I could find. Unfortunately with the slip fit, it is still a pain to get a good water tight seal. You have to be very careful that you don't have any leaks or you will end up with serious problems."
1,POS!,"My old diverter spout began leaking more water out of the spout during showers, so it was time for replacing. I bought this thinking it would do the trick. I purposely went the cheap route b/c we're planning on renovating the bathroom in the next year, so I purposely passed up the more expensive spout. It did not fit well on the 1/2"" pipe as it was designed to. Even after greasing the stub, it never got flush with the wall. I got it to about a 1/4 in close to the wall and figured I'd caulk the gap. Tested for leaks and water dripped out the back when the diverter was up. Returned it and went with the sioux chief smart spout. Install to 5 min, flush to the wall and no leaks!"
1,Run dont walk,Made to fail. The worst products for plumbing I have yet found. It did not make it five minutes before the plastic failed and it started to leak.
1,another FAIL,"universal kit.diverter won't seal. in shower mode, it sprays a lot of water in the tub. This was a $17 part at home depot. wasted my money. complete junk."
1,Water EXPLODES out of the back,"Same experience as danham - only was replacing it due to bathroom remodel - old one worked fine. Teflon taped all threads securely, including the front where the internal plastic adapter threads into the spout, even replaced the o-ring. Water just gushes out of the back. Thanks to Danco's instructions to cut the pipe down, now I will have to call in a plumber to remove the now too short stub and sweat in a new stub out, so that a REAL spout can be mounted. GARBAGE."
2,Not revommended,I felt as though the object appeared used but cleaned up. The inside was used and had to be sprayed with solvent inside and has to be pulled a couple of times to turn shower on.
1,very complex and still leaking,"absolutely not user friendly and not very clear instructions, took nearly a hour of careful reading and trying to follow the steps and still it leaked when you open up the shower."
2,Bad Product,"Bought at a local hardware store. Installation instructions are complex and difficult to follow. In addition to that, it did not fit my 1/2 inch copper pipe. Took it back to the hardware store and the hardware expert verified that it did not fit on a 1/2 inch copper pipe. In then end, resorted to calling a plumber."
1,Leaks badly and will not work,"Edit: I forgot to mention my complaint is the same all others here. It leaks badly from the back no matter how well you tape it up.-----My project was to simply replace all the trimmings in my old bathtub - drain shoe, overflow plate, spout, escutcheon/handle and shower arm. I bought all the Danco pieces and thought I would be done in a couple of hours. Saving a few dollars over what the original brand cost (Moen) was not so bad either.Three DAYS later, the plumber struggled with the spout for an hour before giving up. He is going to have to solder on 1/2 to 3/4 metal converter on my pipe and try again tomorrow. It will probably cost me 100 dollars extra.Put simply - this product is just awful. As a side-note, I am absolutely astonished that Home Depot has an exclusive contract with them."
3,"does bolo fight in this, if he does it's for like as 10 seconds and I missed it","This movie had some good fight scenes, no story, but good to watch for fu fans."
2,lame.. only a couple of good tracks on this soundtrack...,"This is lame. I got it for free so I am not mad. There's only a couple of dope tracks on this cd. Jay-Z's song is great.. one of his best.. Even the Ja Rule and DMX tracks are cool. Freddie Foxxx switches his style up and makes a down-south sounding PIMP song... real cool but odd at the same time. Mysonne makes an interesting performance along with 50 Cent but that's it. The rest of the songs are just average sounding... nothing special.. lackluster. Before you pay a cent for this CD, listen to the whole thing."
2,Broke after 5 weeks,My 7-year-old daughter LOVED this game. Too bad it completely stopped working after 5 weeks.
4,What if fire breathing dragons were real...,"How would they fly, why would they hoard gold, and how did they breed? Author Peter Dickinson attempts to answer these question from the standpoint that Dragons were very much real and, step-by-step, he explains how these meat-eating Hindenburgs would have lived. His viewpoint is that they were animals, and not 'intelligent beings', but, real or not, fire breathing dragons have left a mark in our minds and memories that remains to this modern day. Another plus are the nice dragon illustrations peppering the slim, 132 page coffee table styled book, so fantasy fans will find something to enjoy in it."
5,Essay sytle on dragon flight with wonderful illustrations,"I grew up watching the movie and as an adult found out there really was a book that the movie was based on. The movie plot wise is more closer to The Dragon and the George, Gordon R. Dickson, but I digress. The Book describes the life styles and behavior of dragons and uses citations from classical literature. Absolutely lovely illustrations, it is a fine book to add to any dragon lover's collection"
4,Not the movie,"Although it is a good work, I often wonder why this title was chosen for the movie. Only a few things from this book were used. For those who are looking for the main plot of the movie, this was based largely on one of Gordon R. Dickson's novels THE DRAGON AND THE GEORGE. This is the first of his acclaimed Dragonknight series. Not quite as cute and small child friendly though.I personally view THE FLIGHT OF DRAGONS as a reference source for Gordon's novels...."
5,Wonderful Book,Thank You the easy transaction. Arrived much sooner than quoted. Thank YOu. My husband will be thrilled!Thanks
3,Interesting treatise on a fantastic creature,"Did dragons exist? Well, they're mentioned in the Bible, so that's good enough for moi. Anyway, Dickinson gives an interesting treatise on both the mythology of dragons and evidence of their existence. The beautiful illustrations add to the charm of this book."
5,more than I ever expected,"I went onto T.O.Y.'s website when I found out they had a new CD on the DifferentDrum website. I simply heard a few seconds of ""The Sky is The Limit"" and being the silly girl De/Vision fan that I am, I bought it immediately. I was just so overwhelmed with joy over this new CD by T.O.Y. The first CD that was by T.O.Y. was fantastic. I was hoping to find just one more ""Astronauts"" on here and instead I found a CD that I cant stop playing. I am hooked on the ""Beyond Sleep"" and ""Long Distance Ride"" tracks. The rest is fabulous synthpop too. A new Classic in my collection!"
4,Really good synthpop.,"""White Lights"" by T.O.Y. is a good album. It's not the best, but it is all around a good album. Before judging T.O.Y., you have to take in consideration of their past musical style. They were once known as Evil's Toy in the 90's, and by 2001 they changed not only the band name, but also the style of music. Evil's Toy was labeled as EBM or electro-industrial. T.O.Y. is generally classified as synthpop or furturepop. T.O.Y. differs from Evil's Toy as being cleaned up, more melodic and clear ""singing"" vocals. T.O.Y. features more of a dance style to their music, rather than an ""evil"" style.But bottom line is, both are electronic and great to listen to.""White Lights"" is the second album from T.O.Y, the first being ""Space Radio"". ""White Lights"" is great, but for me personally, I prefer ""Space Radio"". But as a hardcore industrial and EBM fanatic, I also love synthpop as well."
5,First release from Colors Magazine,"Colors Music is a new series of compilations featuring contemporary tracks from around the world. It is not about folk or traditional songs. It is about different ways of understanding and introducing new musical contexts.The NORDIC compilation features Scandinavian music, ranging from chilled atmospheric beats to new jazz constructions.Colors Music is curated by Carlos Casas and William Bottin."
3,Great for starters,This would be great for round dance and traditional practice. It's hard to tell the quality by my computer speakers. Very pleasant.
3,"Okay, but I prefer the polyweb","I like all the elixir strings, but I prefer the polyweb, which doesn't peel off the strings like the nanoweb does. Other than that, these are nice strings too. I'm an elixir fan for sure."
5,The Best,"I've been playing acoustic guitar for many years now, and have tried numerous strings. These are the best bang for your buck, guaranteed. They produce a bright yet full tone, and their longevity and playability can't be beaten."
5,Best acoustic strings by far,"I have a beautiful Takamine acoustic, but I wasn't able to get the tone I thought I should have using cheaper strings. So I gave in to the suggestion of a friend and bought the Elixir Nanowebs. They are well worth the price. Best sounding strings I have ever heard. A very rich tone with bright highs and deep lows. A must buy for anyone serious about their guitars."
4,Good Product Backup,"I've been using Elixir medium acoustic strings for years now and have been very happy with the sound and with how long they hold their tune.However, I've recently been experiencing broken G-strings either within the same day, or 2-3 days after stringing them. The break has been consistantly occuring at the bridge.I called Elixir and explained the problem. They are not only sending me 3 new whole sets of strings, but 3 more spare G-strings. A search on the internet suggests that sometimes you can get a bad run of strings. These things happen, but I am very impressed with how Elixir takes care of their customers!I'd give it 5 stars, but..., well... the G-strings keep breaking. Let's hope it IS just a bad run of strings...."
5,Get These Strings,"I strung my Fender acoustic with these Elixir strings about 5.5 years ago, guess what? They're still on my guitar!! Going strong and sounding better with use. Initially, the sound is bright and crystal clear with high tones. Of course you can make them what ever you want by tuning your strings higher or lower, however they're very crisp at the onset. After some wear and use, they get even better. You still get that clarity and tone however with more character, as one can imagine. Easier sliding on the fret with less friction noise.I'm stuck on Elixirs for life. Just buy them, it's a no-brainer."
5,Love elixer,Elixer strings are the best strings. They feel great sound great and last forever. I would highly recommend them! 5 stars!
5,My favorite strings,"I string up both my acoustic and electric with the elixir nanoweb strings. These things keep their new-string resonance and tone for 2-3x as long as normal strings. I haven't had a set rust on me yet and I've been using them for a few years on both of my guitars. The price could always be better, but I don't see myself purchasing another brand of strings."
3,It was okay,"I saw some of this on tv a while ago. This movie had a weird tone to it. I thought most of the movie was pretty strange, especialy alligator boy. What the hell? It had a good cast though, Selma Blair and Jared Leto."
3,Heading Out To The Highway,"HIGHWAY is an offbeat thriller about two guys Jack (Jared Leto) and Pilot (Jake Gyllenhaal) setting out on a road trip in 1994 to attend a vigil for Kurt Cobain. Jack is also trying to avoid three goons who want to break his legs after he is caught in a compromising position with a married women (Mary Steenburgen). Selma Blair plays a hooker who goes along with them and Jack soon falls for her. Also good is the barely recognisable John C. McGinley as a dreadlocked, pothead hippie (New Zealanders, does this remind you of a certain MP?).HIGHWAY features music by Rich Robinson from The Black Crowes. There's an amusing scene where Jack chainsaws the top off Pilot's car while he is asleep to make it into a convertible. But the biggest standout for me was Desmond the Alligator Boy in his brief but (literally) slimy appearance."
2,this adventure is not that good,Jared Leto plays Jack...Jake Gylenhaal plays Pilot and Selma Blair plays Cassie..Leto and Gylenhaal skip town after Leto boffs this Miranda chick and her husband sends out goons after them...though ok in some spots this movie goes into a long era of involving Snakeboys..a crazy drunken Jeremy Piven(why he's in this movie we dont know)...going to a whoreplace and meeting John C. McGinley....the snakeboy is too scary though the premise is great..boffing some rich guys wife and then leaving town..its a good story but then with all of the rest of the stuff we get lost into a pit of spunk and spit out at the end..only the end is good and the actors show their real talents...if you wanna watch this movie..take the train..not the highway
5,finally,I have been looking for this movie since i first saw it in 02 but im glad i finally got it one of my favorite movies late
4,Life without regard,"I wish I could put 5 stars here because I enjoy the movie so much, but I can't because it's not a 5 star movie. It's not a shawshank redemption, an american beauty, or a forrest gump. What it is is a really entertaining movie for anyone who has ever delved into the subcultures of life. If you know the alternate meanings of blotter, rolling, and blunt then you'll probably enjoy it. If if you've ever lived life without regard, or for the sake of getting lost in a moment, you'll like it. If you love Dazed and Confused, but were unfortunately born into the 80s instead of the 60s, you'll like it.A note of warning, don't buy this movie if you've ever used the phrase ""kids these days"" in a serious fashion."
3,Huh?,"Sex, drugs and rock and roll, yep that about sums it up. One reviewer questioned the ""purpose"" of the aligator boy. I think it was to show Pilot's compassion. Pilot pretended to be going on the road with this friend to help him escape thugs who were after him for sleeping with their boss's wife, but he was really trying to track down a fellow classmate from high school for whom he had an unrequieted love. When he finds her, he realizes she's more messed up than he is(and that's really messed up), and she has no idea who he is. Sorta makes him realize the value of the girlfriend he left. The only thing good I can say about the movie is the acting. Jake Gyllenhaal and Jared Leto are really great."
4,Jared Leto is a total babe,"Jack (Jared Leto) is shown in his full physical glory. For those of you that saw him in Requiem and wanted to see more skin - this movie will please you immensely.OK, so I'm saying buy this movie to see Jared Leto bump & grind away in the buff. I think that's hell of a reason.Jared, if you're out there - you are one hotty!"
4,A surprisingly enjoyable movie,"I watched this movie with very low expectations, but I was very surprised. It was terrifically acted by all of the three leads (Jared Leto, Jake Gyllenhaal, Selma Blair), and they made all of the characters likable even though no one of them were honorable people. The performances save this movie from a weak plot. And while this movie is definitely not for everyone, I reccomend it to people who want to see a movie that is different from every other movie out there."
4,Solid noise canceling headphones,"I went back and forth between these and the Bose (QC15), I read dozens of reviews & decided that the ""Around ear"" style appealed to me more than the ""on ear"". These are very nice headphones; I used them on a 5 hour flight to Cancun & they were comfortable & effective. I used them to watch a movie and I also used them with an ""ambient noise"" program on my iPhone. I use similar headphones in the military (small combatant craft operations), they work similarly, with an external switch you can tap to turn off the noise canceling and hear if someone is talking to you. They appear to be pretty solid quality, the batteries have lasted for almost 10 hours so far, so that's pretty good.They aren't cheap, but for the money, you will most probably be satisfied."
3,Not working with normal mode sometimes.,"Well, I have purchased it 5 months ago. Till last month it was working great.But then started giving so much of static noise. Now normal mode is not working properly."
2,Did not perform up to expectations,"I was pleased with the sound quality of the CX880 earbuds. I bought a pair of PXC450 because it has a similar frequency spectrum, expecting similar performance. When I got these, I tested them side by side. Found much of the mid and high range is muted. I am disappointed in the sound quality. As for it's noise cancelling capability, the jury is still out. I'm seriously considering sending these back and go for a pair of shooter's ear muffs instead."
3,Ticking noise,"Amazing sound quality and solid construction make me want to give these headphones 5 stars. However one major flaw forced me to store these cans after a couple of weeks. When listening to music without noise canceling, the battery makes a ticking sound that is too distracting. To eliminate it I have to remove the battery. This is simply too inconvenient to justify a higher ranking."
4,"Great Quality, Good Value","Generally speaking, this was a good purchase.This product works as advertised. Cuts out significant ambient noise but not quite as much other noise such as people talking; this was as advertised. Good sturdy construction. Comfortable to wear for extended period of time.Music quality is superb. Nice, warm bass, and crisp, clear highs.ONLY real complaint is the PREMIUM price, which seems too high. Given the amount of technology, it is not unrealistic to think this can possibly be justified. I nonetheless would not have purchased had I not found a substantially discounted price."
4,Expensive Earpads,I have had this set for about 2-3 years and they have been great. My biggest issue with them is that the ear pads in my opinion wear out to fast I am on my 3rd set of pads. This set is showing foam and from Sennheiser they are almost 55.00 dollars to replace. I understand that this type of stuff wears out but its not like its electronics or something its foam and plastic they shouldn't cost that much.
2,be aware of the major design flaw,"Sennheiser PXC 450 headphones are a big disappointment. They are good only when used in a noisy environment but next to unusable in a silent room where one would like to switch off the noise canceling feature to get clearer sound quality.The problem is that whenever the battery is installed the rightmost earphone makes this fast ""ticking"" sound. It is audible enough to be heard even with the music playing (with volume level set to low). Switching the headphones to the ""bypass"" mode does not eliminate this ""ticking"" sound.So I have found that the only way to use these headphones in the silent room is to take off the battery. But it is just too much of a hassle.I have bought a pair of Sennheiser PXC 350 headphones as well that do not have this problem. Would suggest these over PXC 450 anytime.So be aware and test these in a silent room first."
3,just a note,"If you're buying this for noise cancelling only, beware that you understand the cord cannot be removed like it can in the QC2's. I sent it back due to not being able to remove the cord. Never listened to it, so I don't have any valid criticism. They could sound great for all I know..."
1,Do not Buy these. It's a joke at that cost. It's made for children's listening to protect the ears.,"The worst sound I have ever heard, compared to my Bose QC 15. It's like night and Day. Bose Wins in huge Margin.I returned the Senhiser in an hour. Was very disapointed."
3,Read before buying,"I did some research, and decided to buy these. When they arrived, I found them to be a little toooo big for traveling, although they come in a nice traveling case. What I hated the most, was the "" made in China"" quality and appearance of these. The are way too plasticky for me. The overall finish of the item is not the GERMAN quality I was expecting. If you don't like cheap Feeling Things, do not buy these. Sound quality, I would give them a 3.5 / 5."
2,Do not waste your money,"If you buy this gear for travelling, do not expect it to cut out the jet engine noise when not listening to audio - as passive headphones go you would be better off buying a set of ear muffs. These headphones are well made and the voice through mode is quite good. A clip to hang on your belt would be useful as they are quite bulky."
1,these 'phones are uncomfortable,"These (450) Sennheisers DO do a very good job of cancelling out sound, however, the low range is average at best, it eats battery even when unplugged from the source (clumsy engineering), and something in the right can is severely uncomfortable to wear. I can't wait to take them off.The above reviewer is right about the seller of these ""refurbished"" products...rude, rude, rude. And they're probably not properly refurbished is my guess!"
1,Warning!!,"""I ordered the Sennheiser PXC 450 NoiseGard Active Noise-Canceling Headphones and found it to be defective upon delivery. Sent it back the next day and Z Electria charged a 25% fee for restocking the defective item, to the amount of $75.00. After calling Z Electria multiple times to no avail after a period of two weeks I finally dealt directly with Amazon's customer service.. Issue finally resolved"""
1,Poor sound compared to Beats by Dr Dre,"I tried Beats by Dr Dre for a day. Then decided to order Sennheiser PCX 450. I tried them only for about 20 minutes and decided to return them. The sound of Sennheiser is so much inferior, I could not believe. The bass in Sennheiser does not exist. Also, there is vibrating sound when I turn my head towards my left arm. It's very bad when noise cancelling headphones create noise."
1,These sound like crap - and I've tried 2 pairs.,I don't understand the rave reviews. I bought a pair of these and they sounded so bad compared to my Bose QC1 I sent them back.I got a new pair that aren't any better. They lack base and the sound is unclear and muddy whencompared to the Bose.My advise it to listen to a pair before buying. I consider them a waste of money.
3,I didnt like it!!!,"I hate the comfort of this headphone!! I love to listen hip-hop rnb music, with basses. This headphone is very bad with basses, it was my opinion because i used Beats by Dr.Dre. And I'll tell you what, the beats fro my better in the sound quality, but about the durability and NC Sennhaisers wins. Also comfort in beats way better, by the way PXC450 is literally huge as hell!!!"
2,Did not meet expectations.,"Unfortunately, these headphones did not meet expectations and had to be returned. We purchased the Boise instead and love them."
1,Please give me refund !,"I return this item on May 13, 3 months passed, i sent the seller more than 5 emails, but i don't get any information from you guys. I have given you all information about the detail of this item, I don't know what can i do then, you guys just check your email please!"
3,Regrettably Disappointed,"Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling HeadphonesUpon going through the reviews posted on this site pertaining to this headphone I decided to order the model for use in my travels. I was looking for high quality sound recognizing that the noise canceling feature would not be as impressive as the Bose Q 15 set. My disappointment consisted of the poor sound quality and volume strength of the Sennheiser PXC 450 compared to the Bose Q 15 or other brands for that matter. I ended up returning the Sennheiser PXC 450 and keeping the Bose headset as I was impressed by the noise canceling and was pleasantly impressed with the quality and sharpness of the sound, that I was not expecting at all."
2,Don't waste your time or money,"Sennheiser is supposed to be a good brand. My last Sennheiser headphones were in 2001 and I loved them.Let me start off by making it clear that I am directly comparing the PXC450 headphones with the Bose QC15 headphones. I've used the QC15s for roughly two years and absolutely love them. I'm in the market for another pair of noise cancelling headphones and wanted to give Sennheiser a shot--again. I paid $299 for the QC15s and $349 for the PXC450s.The PXC450s have decent sound reproduction but nothing compared to the QC15s. The sound is muffled with significantly lackluster. The drivers in the PXC450s also touch my ear when wearing them--with normal use and slight movement the drivers chafe and cause irritation. The over-the-ear cups are giant and leave gaps which renders the ANC useless. If holding the cups tightly to my ears, the ANC isn't anywhere near the quality and significance of the QC15s.My recommendation is to steer-clear of the PXC450s."
4,Great Headphones in Loud Situations,"Great Build Quality - Strong joints, tough sturdy plastics, good passive noise reduction, excellent active noise reductionSound - Boxed in feel without active noise reduction, sound somewhat thins out with active noise reduction (esp. low freq), active sound processing bypass switch is not perfect (clicking sound with battery in and active noise reduction off- workaround is to take the battery out)Comfort - EXCELLENT, 9 oz never felt so lightAccessories - All I require with gold plated plugs (1 for airplane, 1 for sound system, 1 for mp3 player), case seems to be made out of some sort of lightweight plastic wrapped in rugged cloth (I expected leather).Overall - not for the audiophile but great headphones nonetheless especially if you require active noise cancellation (the best I think). These headphones are for those who dont like the ""canal"" earphone with noise reduction (although a few earphones are better at noise reduction than these)."
5,"Great for travel, good noice cancellation","I wanted to clarify a few items:1) the cord can be detached from the headphones2) noise cancellation is very good, the talk through feature actually works well as i have used it a few times on the plane3) I have a large head and these headphones fit perfectlyCons:1) the headphones are very light due to the materials used...however this makes them also a bit more fragile than the Q3's i have used before2) headphones generate the best sound i have heard from headphones (Q3, Q2, top end in ear buds etc.), however they do not excel at medium highs...everything else from base, high pitch to talk sounds greatif you want good travel headphones, buy these"
3,PXC450 vs Bose QC15,"I purchased PXC450 b/c they advertised 90% noise cancellation (NC) b/c NC was my number 1 reason to shop for headset. However, after trying it and comparing it against Bose QC15, I was disappointed. PXC450 NC doesn't even come close to QC15. Actual NC of PXC450 I would est. to be around 35-45%, not more than that.PXC450 built quality, features and most of all sound quality are much much better than QC15. I was most impressed with the sound quality of PXC450. It was crystal clear and spot on. Please note that QC15 sound quality is much better than many headsets in the market. I would rate wear comfort about the same for both. QC15 case is much better and sturdier than PXC450.Therefore, after evaluating both headsets, I decided to go with QC15 simply b/c I wanted headset with best NC. So my advise to you is that if you want a headset with awesome sound quality, go with PXC450. However, if like me NC is your main concern then definitely stick with QC15."
5,Highly Regarded at HeadRoom,"I am shopping for noise-blocking headphones, and notice that the PXC-450 are given a favorable review by the HeadRoom people, who are pretty discriminating. Since they are audiophiles, they view active noise reduction as a hindrance, but rate PXC-450 highest of any over-the-ear noise blockers.http://www.headphone.com/products/headphones/all-headphones/sennheiser-pxc-450.phpI hope this helps,Tim"
3,Noise Canceling Function has Limited Application,"In a low ambient noise environment the NC function is superb delivering a most pleasing quality. It is at a cost of slight pressure on the ear drum. At times the pressure is not equal causing an imbalance perception. The major drawback of the 450 is that it has limited application. It cannot be used on small aircraft or loud environments. This includes jet engine reversal when landing. The headset rumbles equally loud to the ambient noise. I am forced to use my older generation Bose NC headphones when travelling on smaller aircraft. The Sennheiser engineer I spoke with states that the 450 cannot be used in an environment with heavy vibration. While accoutically and structurally superior to the older generation Bose, the 450 is less functional."
2,Looks aren't everything...,"I hunted and hunted for a nice quality noise-canceling pair of headphones. The packaging is great. The headphones look nicely put together and they are super comfortable. It's all downhill from there. The noise-canceling aspect is highly overrated. It didn't block out any sounds. Now, I'm not new to noise-canceling and knew what I should expect at a minimum. It didn't even come close to the Audio Technica pair I had before. My son was playing the Wii and I could hear EVERYTHING. Additionally, while having it plugged into my laptop, the volume while watching Netflix left a lot to be desired. Needless to say, I returned these a few days later. I love Amazon, though. They took them back with no issue. Unfortunately, I'm still looking for a good pair of headphones."
2,Disappointing,"The sound quality of the Sennheiser headphones is very good, but problems exist. The fit is poor. They are not snug over the ears, shifting frequently when worn so that there are gaps that allow noise to come in. This was true for both me and my wife. It isn't a case of ""one size fits all."" It didn't properly fit either of us. Another factor of this shifting of position was that there was a frequent deep pulsation that was very annoying. If the headphones were held tight over the ears, the pulsation went away, but when worn normally, it returned almost every time I moved my head. Even the active noise suppression was not adequate. On a flight, it was not enough to allow my wife to clearly hear the dialogue of the movie over the sound of the engines. For a higher priced set of headphones, they did not meet our expectations."
3,not a real noise cancelling headphone,"It is not a real noise cancelling headphone. It does reduce a little bit noise. But with noise cancelling on and from my room, I can still hear what my mom is doing in kitchen and what my kids are talking to each other in their room (of course, with door open). I think a pair of cotton balls could provide better noise isolation.And also, the manual claims that the noise cancellation works for sound below 1000 Hz only. I did some test with low frequency sounds. It does not work well either.Other than the noise cancelling, everything else looks and works great. Especially the talk-through function is very useful. However, I already have another high quality headphone without noise cancellation. There is no reason for me to get another expensive headphone with tiny noise cancellation.Just returned it and ordered a Bose QuietComfort 15 with next day delivery. I will post some updates after I get it tomorrow."
4,Solid Quality,"Yes they are expensive but they make sense if you do a lot of flying in airplanes. They are comfortable even on a long flight. They are very quiet, because of the noise canceling feature and also because of the solid construction and the fact the phones go around your entire ear. They sound very nice for music and voice reproduction. The quality of materials and workmanship is very high, as you would expect with the price."
3,"love it, but have to return it.","My bf gave me this as Xmas gift. Very sweet of him. Love this product, but had to return it because the ear-cups are too big to me. It leaves gaps between the earphone and my head therefor the noise cancellation function became useless. When I press down the earphone to eliminate the gaps, it does block much sound. Well, it took the unpleasant edge away. I imaging in the airplane in the economic seat, which is why I need an expensive phone, it is enough for me to relax a bit. I would have to try bose now to see if they have ear-cups that fit me better."
4,very big,"Great earphones but the ear pieces are HUGE. A lot bigger than I expected.If you are after comfort over a little difference in sound quality, go for Bose instead."
3,"Ok, but I wouldn't recommend it","bought them for using in the office and they are cool most of the time, BUT - when I use it w/o music, just for noise canceling - I can hear creepy sounds like those that come from GSM and radio office equipment, I don't know how wired headphones could capture anything like that"
3,"Good product, but not as nice as Bose QC 15","I originally purchased the Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones from Best Buy, and liked the product, but ended up taking them back because I didn't want to spend $320.00 (includes tax) for them. I did a lot of research on the internet, and found some great reviews on these Sennheiser headphones. I decided to purchase them, and am a little disappointed now that I got them. Even though the Sennheiser's sound is really clear, and crisp, the Bose headphones had a lot more bass, and the noise cancellation on the Bose is substantially better. The Bose are also easier to put in the case, and are more compact as well. If I could do things over again, I would have kept the Bose."
4,I like them,"These are the first pair of noise canceling head phones I have had. So my thought were let down some when I tried them at work, as there can be lots of people talking around my work station. They don't remove all sound but they do tone down the sound so you can enjoy less noise than if you didn't have them. When I use them on the airplane it knocks out the LOUD flight attendant voice plus they quite the loud engine noise when taking off plus during the flight there is hardly any noise that you notice. Now when you add some music or video that is all you hear..good quality sound, not a lot of base but what you do hear is clear crisp sound coming from the speakers. I like the look of the headphons and they are very comfortable. The hard case you store the headphones in is a real plus to the purchase..Overall I would recommend these headphones to anyone...."
4,These are very good headphones.,"I would recommend these headphones. I like that they come in a nice,sturdy travel case and different connecters for airplanes etc. The noise reduction works well. It is great that with the touch of a button, you can listen to outside noise. The price was very good and the shipment was fast."
5,Just awesome.,"Noise elimination is very good, the ""talk through"" feature is really cool. The sound from these is just incredible. I'm not an audiophile, but I love listening to music from my iPhone and iPad through headphones. These headphones make listening very enjoyable. Because of their noise elimination and the detail of sound they create, there is no need to blast the volume. I can listen at a very comfortable level and really enjoy the music, and for longer periods of time.Features are excellent, they feel solid and appear to be capable of lasting for a long time.Expensive, but highly recommended."
5,THANK YOU!!!,"The most detailed and beneficial review, for my exact needs, to date on any product.... ever!!! Thank you for your detailed and well thought out review. Unbiased and perfect. I now know what product to buy thanks to you!!!"
1,Wasted effort,After searching online reviews I settled on the PXC 450 headphones. Spent extra to express mail these headphones so I would have them on a cross country flight Florida to Seattle in two days. Opened the box tonight and found the headphones do not work - even used new batteries other than the ones included in the kit. Hopefully I can get another set overnight - otherwise all the music in my Iphone not be heard on this trip.
2,Ebony Dreams,"Ebony Dreams was the same title as Miss Melody Jones, so I ended up ordering the same thing twice and also the copy that I received was not even that clear."
4,Good Noodles,"Bought a case of these. They are fast, convenient, and really versatile. I'd buy again."
3,Led Zeppelin - 'In Through The Out Door' (WEA) 3 1/2 stars,"Review no. 231. Originally released in the later part of 1979, I remember the very day this swansong of the mighty Led Zeppelin hit the stores. Myself and a few others planned on attending their concert in Chicago. But, of course their U.S. tour was sadly called off after the death of drummer Johm Bonham. Maybe not as great as Zeppelin's 'IV', 'Houses Of The Holy' or 'Physical Graffiti' (my personal favorites) but still a decent effort. Tracks that managed to make it to the late night 'FM staple play list' for at least awhile were the refreshing ""In The Evening"", ""Fool In The Rain"", the upbeat ""Hot Dog"", ""All My Love"" and the bluesy ""I'm Gonna Crawl"". Worthy of a place in your music collection."
2,Forgettable.,"I keep on thinking, if John Bonham might've lived, we would get a heavy album from them. That's what Jimmy Page said. This album, while it has some good tracks, is mostly filler. This stuff should've been on Coda, and the material on Coda should've been this album. There are way too many syntheizers on here, you barely hear the guitar! It was unique at the time, but now it will just make old members angry. I'm Gonna Crawl is good, and so is South Bound Saurez, but I can see where they were going with this album. Laregly forgettable."
2,"My thoughts on ""In Trough The Out Door""","The only tune on this mess worth giving a second listening is ""Hot Dog"".If you like burning your own CD's, it's a good one to put in the mix.The boys were burned out by this point. It happens. Sad, but it happens.First it's the sophmore jinx, then the burn out.Zep fan forever!,Bill"
3,Weakest CD of Zep,This is by far the weakest CD from Zep before the end of the band.All Of My Love and Hot Dog are the standout tracks.I'm gonna Crawl is not bad either.Never to be great again.
1,WARNING: DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst Led Zeppelin album ever! Zeppelin DESTROYS their heavy blues rock image with the pop of ""Fool in the Rain"" and ""All of My Love"". For die hard fans, your respect for Zep will vanish in the haze after listening to this album. In the name of all things sacred, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,useless,"I've both some bad cd's in my time: reservoir dogs soundtrack(a rip off),presence by led zep,topographic oceans by Yes,the steve Howe album (beware of this one),eskimo by the residents, and this little stinker. What the sugar happened to led zep? Well, they ran out of ideas, they over indulged in drugs/drink whatever. Just look at their solo careers. What solo careers? Exactly. You see most of their (good) stuff is derived from other people's music, blues and folk, so there was a limit to how much quality music they could produce, they hadn't got enough talent/imagination to break free and make good 'different' kind of music. So you get this mess of an album, it's all synths but they are not used very effectively. I am fond of careslambra in a cheesy way, that's it. Jimmy Page is a guitar God,not on this album though. Thank you."
1,tedious album weak!,"yes I agree with some fans who saying that this one is a funny stuff alots of disco movement, it did not sound like ZEP anymore."
1,A true dialogue,"John Paul Jones: I'm serious this time. I had enough of one-note bass lines. I am a serious keyboard player, Wakeman has nothing on me. And I have keyboard-based material enough for a full album.Jimmy Page: Oh, shut up, John, you know our fans want to hear me playing guitar. You are expendable.JPJ (pissed off now): That's what you think! We can issue an all-keyboard based album and it would be our best ever! People will love it!JP (slightly amused): And you will take care of it, so all I have to do is pose for the promo pics and put a couple solos?JPJ (defiant): Exactly!JP (too doped to argue): Whatever..."
4,Interesting album,"In Through The Out Door is a very interesting and diverse album. The use of synthesizer is very prevelant on this album. All the songs are pretty good, listenable songs. Carouselambra is probably some of the strangest eleven minutes of music you'll ever listen too. The rest of the songs aren't too shabby, including the best on the album, In The Evening, and All My Love. All in all, if you're into Zeppelin, this album is worth the money."
5,majestic ending,"For all the obvious weaknesses (Page's withdrawal from songwriting, Plant's strained voice, somnambulent overdubbing, etc.), there is a strength to this album that can well said to be missing from their earlier ones. Firstly, there is a mountain of terrifying, majestic sound. If you consider Wearing and Tearing as part of this album, in terms of it being from the same sessions, it even gets more terrifying. But, secondly, and most importantly, the lyrics and delivery reflect an older, wiser Robert Plant. Thirdly, Page begins developing his 80s soloing style, typified by the B-bender. Fourth, there's no loss of originality. Carouselambra represents yet another bold turn in the band's career. No stone is left unturned, in pursuit of 'the truth'.RIP ..."
1,What Happened?,"Zep went soft and sappy for their studio finale. ""In the Evening"" and """"Im Gonna Crawl"" are okay, but the rest...blech!"
2,Pretty pathetic work,Maybe if Zepplin had proped up that drunk of a drummer he wouldn't have choked on his own vomit and they would have been around a little longer. Then they could have put on some make up of their own and and really showed everyone who's boss...nah...another band that was alot better had already done that. Im glad that good old J.D. let everyone know how Zepplin got around to deciding how they should go about doing their albums.All you had to do was show up to band practice first! I can see it now....Jones got up early on Christmas morning to discover that Santa had left him a brand new keyboard set.He rushes down as quick as he can and to his amazement he is the first to show up to practice so he gets to have first say on how the album will go.Soon afterwards Bonham gets mad because he thinks its his turn to be first and goes on a drinking binge and........well we all know what happened after that dont we.Get over it.this album sucked back then and it still does today.
1,Led Zep freak who hates this album.,"I am a huge Zep fan but, when this album came out my friend and I thought it was a joke by the radio station that was playing it for the first time. We couldnt believe that Zep could make anything this bad. In the Evening is the only song that resembles the greatness of Led Zep. Avoid this album at all cost. Physical Graffiti, Presence, I, II, IV are much better than this pile of crap. Even III and Houses of the Holy are better but are not great albums. Take it from a Zep freak and not a Zep hater this album sucks."
2,Only Word that can Describe this album is GAY,"Holy Crap I've been getting into LZ alot lately...You know I was to young when they were at there peak and grew up in a Beatles/GratefulDead Family..Just recently bought the box set and The first 7 albums are all great minus some eh songs on Presence. But I threw this on and I almosted puked! Thats all I have to say, Don't buy unless you need every Zepp Album. : )"
2,A ho - hum album from a boring band,"This album much like the others Led Zepplin did aren't that great.Everyone likes to say that their music is so hard and it rocks and that they were the greatest band during the 70's but i have news for ya kids.....there were so many other bands during the 70's better than they were.They were Kiss,Aerosmith, Van Halen,Ted Nugent,Ozzy and Black Sabbath just to name a few.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this.Get music form some of the above mentioned bands instead."
4,"Not their best, but not horrible","Led Zeppelin / In Through The Out Door: With seven tracks that contain two fantastic songs, two good songs, and three poor songs, this is hardly a bad album, but it certainly is not their best. ""Fool in the Rain"" and ""All my Love"" are just enough to push this album into a Four Star rating."
4,"A New Rebirth, Could Have Been?","First, I must admit that I prefer this album over three of Led Zeppelins previous ones. You can guess which ones I am referring to? ""All Of My Love and Fool In The Rain are two of the best ballads of the 1970's. The former is Robert Plants paen to his lost son Karac, while the latter is an uptempo Sambaesque version of their earler tunes. These two alone were worth the $. ""In The Evening is a fine good vibes driving song."" It sounded like a stealthy version of ""In The Light,"" from Physical Graffiti. Carouselambra is a three part mystery. You wonder if the song ended, and a new one began? South Bound Suarez has a driving beat. The other two songs, Im Gonna Crawl and Hot Dog were not to my taste. They did not seem to fit in with the others. Too bad this was there last album, it showed new directions while largely retaining their roots."
4,For John Paul Jones fans,"Some reviewers believe that if John Bonham had not died, this album represents what the mighty Led Zep would have sounded like during the 80's. What is not understood is what was going on in the band in the late 70's. Pagey's heroin habit was catching up to him, which explains why he is such a non-entity. Take a good look at the song credits, nearly every single song includes John Paul Jones in the writing credits. This is a Jonesy/Percy album, not a Pagey/Percy album, and yet another facet of the band that included folk (III), pop (Houses of the Holy), blues (I & II) and hard rock (Physical Graffitti, Presence), and combinations of all of the above (IV) in their repertoire. Check out the outtakes from these sessions that appear on Coda. Page is back in control of the band and back in form (Darlene, Walter's Walk). In Through The Out Door is just another step (albeit the final one) in the wonderful musical journey known as Led Zeppelin."
4,"Great, Underrated Album","This album is so different from anything that had been done before, and especially from anything that this band had done before (all classics). It represents a total shift in direction - Led Zeppelin would never rely on any one sound. If you listen and use your brain, you'll realize this album was the precursor to the 80's - and that John Paul Jones was the most underrated member of this group.If you have rock or Zep albums this one is a must. See musical diversity at its finest when the greatest hard rock band goes 80's, soft, synth-rock, bluegrass and blues in the same album."
2,tedious album! weak!,"This one is the lowest rate of Zeppelin, I personally do not understand why this band was becoming huge in the States and Canada? To me, this band never made me a real fascination, though some their songs are nice too... I think Deep Purple is more quite nice and powerfull,...ok it is part of major taste! The early ZEP albums were much better, because their original style was more oriented in blues rock music, in fact Led Zep was not a typical pure Hard Rock band... This album is really a bit tedious!"
3,Collectors Piece,"If you are a true Led Zeppelin fan you must buy all of their pre-1980 albums. Most us us (of age) have owned all the LPs in both the album and CD formats (if not cassaette and 8-tracks too). This LP was weak compared to the previous classics. It is important because of the death of John Bonham shortly after its released (and with that the death of Led Zeppelin). In spite of its weaknesses, this LP is well the price because of 4 superb classics: Fool In The Rain, All My Love, In The Evening, and Carouselambra. Don't leave this one out of your Zeppelin collection.ZOSO"
1,"tedious album, what a huge dissapointment!!!!","some people said this Zeppelin album is bad, some said it is good. but I have to say honesty that this Led Zep album is a very weak and boaring album,.....the first and the second albums were better in their early days! For Zep fanatical fans, this album is certainly always good..... but I don't think that Zeppelin is the best rock band of all....."
5,HA HA HA is Right,"No, not laughing at the album, just the fact that there is someone so ill informed about music and Led Zeppelin that they would rate this recording with one star. Just go back to the forgettable music by the forgettable bands that you currently listen to.As for In Through the Out Door, although it wasn't the Band's best (that's a tall order), it is better than anything being released today. I'm Gonna Crawl and Fool in the Rain are great.5-stars, easily."
3,Pretty So-So Material,"In Through the Out Door reminds me of the Who's last few studio albums - competent enough, great sounding, but pretty short of new ideas. Any Led Zeppelin album where the highlights are the ballads is really not quite up to snuff. That said, Fool in the Rain is still a great song, but All of My Love gets a little old with repetition. The rest of this album, though interesting to listen to, is ultimately expendable."
2,the man with the female voice???,"what happened to the man with a female voice? I did not find any good songs in this ZEP album, except Fool in the rain. If you re a fanatical Zep fans, you might be saying that this album is a good one too,...but only for ZEP fans!"
3,One good one,"I bought this for bonzo`s masterpiece of drumming ""Fool In The Rain""His version of the halftime shuffle on that track is one for the ages. He gets your attention with the finely layered hi hat and ghost note snare pattern that features accents on the down beats on the hi hat.Then, he lays into a quarter note triplet ride pattern for the chorus while keeping the bass drum pattern the same as the verse.All the while his left foot is playing an eighth note hi hat time keeping rhythm.Definitely His best work in my opinion, and i`m a bonzo type of drummer who knows his entire catalog. The rest of the CD is okay featuring tunes like ""In The Evening"", ""Carouselambra"" and ""All Of My Love"" but none of them compare to their earlier work or ""Fool In The Rain""."
5,ULTIMO SUSPIRO DEL DINOSAURIO.........,"AQUI SE ACABA TODO...PERO CON ALTURA, CON DIGNIDAD...ARRANCA CON POLENTA Y TERMINA CON UN DERRAME DE DULZURA APTA PARA LAS FM DE LA EPOCA...SIN LA ORIGINALIDAD DE ANTAÑO PERO CON TODA LA ARROGANCIA Y FUERZA QUE HIZO DE ESTA BANDA REFERENTE INEQUIVOCO DE LOS '70."
4,Silly..,"Listening to this album makes me laugh, there is some funny stuff on this album and I think the point was to mock the whole disco movement. While all the other album focused on everyone else in the group except for John Paul Jones this is HIS album. You have a lot of nice synth work and Robert's voice is in top condition like it had been before, it sounded soo much like it was going to be their last studio album recorded at the time and surely and sadly, it was."
3,When You Walk The Sweet Walk,"Generally dismissed by critics, IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR actually has several great moments, among them the glittering entrance of Page's lead guitar on ""In The Evening,"" and the drifting instrumental break a few moments later. Plant's throaty vocals on ""I'm Gonna Crawl"" are pretty amazing, and the throb of ""South Bound Saurez"" is pretty hard to ignore too.The only really sour passage here is ""Fool In The Rain,"" one of the most annoying songs ever recorded by a great band.But, when set in the context of ""All My Love"" and ""Carouselambra,"" it's only a small drop of annoyance in a larger pool of good. IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR is not the typical Led Zeppelin record, but it isn't nearly as bad as critics would have you believe."
5,Another Ten Minutes No Longer,"I had never listened to much Led Zeppelin before I was introduced to ""Fool in the Rain"" by a close friend. Since then, I have acquired every Led Zeppelin album except Presence on vinyl, and although they are by far the best band of all time, nothing compares to Fool in the Rain. It's just a song that makes you go, ""Uh!"" The album gets 5 stars for this song alone."
3,Swan Song,"This is a replacment of the L.P. that I had in high school, All of my love, and Im gonna crawl are the best tracks on the CD. If your looking to buy it for sentimental value, try to purchase the actual Lp. The art work within the sleeve is worth the investment.."
4,zeps weakest is still great by other bands standards.,"Ok , this is a three star led zep cd , which means it's a five star rock n roll cd. That means it's awesome in alot of ways. BUt being this is led zep it's unfortunately not their best work and it's hard not to want them to just let loose again. but you can sense the friction in this one, as they argue over the cover! and stuff like that. Excess was rearing it's head here but this is still a classic band that has a weaker cd from them. It got classics on it but all bands have weaker cd's . so on a led zep scale this is a 3 star but on a rock scale this is a five star. I think most zep fans would play this one last if they were going to play them in a row. (original studio releasees that is)."
3,It's oaky.,"Unfortunately, there were ""digital faux paux"" which caused skipping on a track or two. Not a BIG,big deal...but annoying none-the-less (so to speak)."
2,They should have given up,"..after ""Presence"". The album starts with the jarring ""In the Evening"" and mantains that standard throughout."
4,Late Zeppelin before the end,"This was pretty much it for our four boys. The end of the line or so we thought at the time. John Paul Jones was now almost totally in control of the band giving it his uniquely modern sound. Jimmy Page was pretty much out of the picture creatively battling his own self inflicted demons. It would be fair to say the work suffered. Being the champs they were Led Zeppelin still managed to crank out a few more memorable songs. In the Evening elegantly haunts us even today with its gently swaying rythms and melodies. All my love compliments this all very nicely with a sweet, soft glow one doesn't often expect from a rock band. Was the end near? Absolutely. Was the magic over? Never. We still have these inspired works to remind us how great their music really was and will always be. The magic lives on."
3,heavy responsibility,"this here record had the unfortunate side effect of spawning the dave matthews band. don't believe me? give ""fool in the rain"" another listen.yep."
4,"Classic ""rain"" music!","I love bluesy rock, it reminds me of the rain, and I love the rain. ""Fool in the Rain"" is definitely one of my favorite songs of all time. The only reason I give this four stars is because this album sounds a little bit too happy, and it doesn't really fit with the rain motif. They should have kept their old style, and written ""Fool in the Rain"" like that. But oh, well, it's rainy music nonetheless. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. If you like this album, check out my favorite band, Candlebox."
2,what happened?,"I do not find any of good albums in this synthesizer versions,...Led Zeppelin tried to make a pop scene, but left their legacy from the first three albums. Only Fool in the rain is acceptable."
2,"SEE, THE PROBLEM WITH THIS ALBUM IS... THAT IT SUCKS.","Sorry.Physical Graffitti was the last real romp for Zep.Presence had Achilles Last Stand but that was really it. You can almost rock out with the rest of it if you are really open minded.Have you checked out CODA yet?Some people may dig this later release by Led Zeppelin but my copy eventually turned into a frisbee.Oh well, that heavy hammer couldn't pound forever, unless...I... II... III... IV.... ""It's been along time since I rock and rolled...."""
3,song by song review,"in the evening-good. a classic. synth and guitar have equal dominance.south bound suarez-ok.fool in the rain-great song. great performance by all band members. last great zeppelin song to be featured on a proper studio album. not as overplayed as you'd like to think.hot dog-corny. still a fun song thoughcarouselambra- sucks. synth overkill. supposedly an ""epic"".all my love- too, too sentimental for my tastes. lack of guitars.i'm gonna crawl- snore. ITTOD's equivalent of Tea For One.this album would have seriously benifited from the outtakes featured on coda."
2,Synthesizers Killed Rock and Roll,"When the Who opened the classic album ""Who's Next"" with that classic synth riff on ""Baba O' Reilly,"" it sounded fresh, young, and showed the band's incredible power in many aspects. A few years later, tragedy in rock and roll land occured, Jimmy Page and the boys got lazy when they tried to also use the synthesizer, and downsized the incredible force that was Led Zeppelin. ""In Through the Out Door,"" Led Zeppelin's crapsterpiece sounds like an old man dying (the old man is rock), after taking an entire bottle of AOR. The only thing that makes this album palateable is the irresistable classic ""Fool in the Rain,"" which is reason enough to pick it up. It's ironic to think that an album containing such a fresh and exciting song is one of the albums that killed rock and roll and paved the way for many crappy 80's artists that were inspired by this rock and roll drivel."
3,In through the out door,"I do agree that this album was not at the top of Zeppelins podium, they have pratically pissed all over there work. But zeppelin is zeppelin. It is the stepping stones to the music of today and tomorow.I love them and i always will"
3,A so-so last album,"True Zeppelin fans will want to have this, and in truth it does have some really fine moments. Jimmy Page said it was a ""transitional"" album, although to what we shall never know. ""In The Evening"" is a great hard rocker, anchored by keyboards that give it an 80s synth-rock feel. ""All My Love"" and the lilting ""Fool in the Rain"" are worthy songs. Non-Jonesy fans will probably find it hard to sit through ""Carouselambra"", the 10-minute keyboard epic. The rest is a tad sub-par for Zeppelin, but all in all this album is a decent performance."
2,Left To Their Own Devices,"This is the first and only Zeppelin album that is completelyvoid of any ripp offs - ( of blues artists ,contemporaries , or acoutic masters like Bert Jansch and Davey Graham ). Its Led Zeppelin left to their own devices... and it shows. The album starts off really strong with In The Evening - great song. The 3rd track Fool In The Rain is kind of a fun pop song - pretty good tune . Unfortunately the festivities end there. The rest of this album is a musical exploration into mediocrity. The song All My Love is 100% certified crap. If youre Michael Bolton its a work of art. If youre Led Zepp its a cry for help. Im GonnaCrawl ... This is what Zeppelin sounds like trying to write a blues song ... without the help of Wilie Dixon , Muddy Waters or the host of other bluesmen they "" borrowed "" from . Anyway, the point is this is very dissapointing album especially comming off a 3 year wait from Presence.. which was a pretty decent album."
2,A huge zep fan,"This album was a dissapointment. Buy it only if you are a Zep fun. If not, prefer some of their older albums. The only songs that stand out are ""In the evening"" and ""All my love"", there is nothing else in this album. Even these 2 songs are mediocre for Zep."
2,Not the Greatest,"As far as Led Zeppelin goes, in through the out door is not the greatest you could buy. Of course it contains the great ""All of My Love,"" but most of the other tracks on the album are not good. I think you'll find them repetetive and boring. I gave most of the songs 2 stars on my iTunes.If you are looking to buy some Zeppelin, may I reccomend ""Lez Zeppelin IV,"" the original ""Led Zeppelin,"" or if your looking for some good zep in the later days, i reccomend ""physical graffiti"""
4,"Out the door, but not out completely","I only have this recording on vinyl so I don't know if the quality is the same on the cd. This recording takes a slower, synth based, sort of depressing feel. From synth based but still rocking songs like ""All Of My Love"" and ""I'm Gonna Crawl"" can't dissapoint any zeppelin fan. It was the closing to the Zeppelin reign, Jimmy Page didn't want to record much anymore because of his health, and then JPJ took over the helm. I play bass guitar, and JPJ is a god who every bass player recognizes, and even though there was more synth than bass to be found, it's safe to presume JPJ did better than Jimmy could do at that period in time. A must have for all Zeppelin fans."
4,Cute book,"I really like this book.It is for younger teens, but we're also making it work for college girlies :)It's awesome to see how highly God thinks of us,you should read this book!"
4,Very good rice cooker !!!,"Cons: no on/off switch. Pros: making good/consistent rice, easy-to-clean exterior."
2,RICE BURNS BELOW,I THANK THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE MANUAL ARE NOT CLEAR. pLEASE GIVE ME THE MEASUREING GUIDELINES. I LOVE MY RICE COOKER BUT IT HAS DISAPPOINTED ME.
5,6.5 years and still steaming,"We got this as a wedding gift and use it multiple times each week, making anywhere between 3 and 7 cups of rice at a time. I'm writing this review now because I'm starting to look for another rice cooker... after 6.5 years. The cooker keeps on steaming perfectly, but we've slowly worn down the nonstick surface inside the liner. I'm not disappointed; we've had a lot of great meals because of this machine. For its successor we're only considering Zojirushi because of how pleased we are with this model. And yes, I'll agree with another commenter that the floral pattern is part of the style. That way you know it's a legit Zojirushi and you won't confuse it with a Black & Decker or Westinghouse... you definitely do not want to make that mistake."
5,Keeps on ticking.,"I have had my zojirushi 10 cup rice cooker for over 30 years, it has feed 4 kids and works as good now as it did when we first bought it.We go through 100 pounds of rice a year. And thats a lot of rice for one family. Rice tastes so much better cooked in it. These are a great investment and I am shopping to buy one as a gift now. You cant go wrong with this rice cooker."
5,I have owned this one for 5 years and it's still going!,"I'm not Asian but my husband is. Because of the inlaws my children love rice and seaweed. I was given this rice cooker by my inlaw to make rice for her son, well it's still going strong and I have not had any problems. The unit is beyond easy to use and I make 4 cups of rice as a standard for our family and keep it plugged in for 3 days and the rice stays warm and ready to eat. That's the way my Mother in Law did it, and I have done the same without any problems.Oh and never, ever use any metal items in the rice cooker or you will ruin it. The plastic spoon is really all you need for fluffing your rice once it's finished cooking."
5,Great rice cooker,Had purched the same brand while I was in Japan (almost idntical). It lasted about 20 years. It cooks rice fast and keeps it wrm for a long time (and is still good to eat.) Very good rice cooker.
5,The Best,"We bought this to replace our 8 cup rice steamer that we had for over 20 years. All I can say is that this cooks our rice perfectly every time. We usually only cook 2-3 cups of rice & only when we have company over do we cook 10 cups. It has flowers, it does what it was design to do. Cook rice. Highly recommend this product."
2,"My first one worked for 8 years, the new one is going back.",I bought my first one back in 2004 when we first moved into our own home. It worked great until about 2 months ago when the 'keep warm' light won't even come on. So... I found one in the warehouse deals for a good price but it prematurely pops the cook level from cooking to warming when the rice is not even done. I tried 3 times until I gave up. I'm going to look at the Tiger brand this time. My sister owns the JNP-1800 and it works so we'll see. They're about the same price.
2,Dead after less than 1 year!,"I did not buy this rice cooker here but from a local super large Asian market for about the same price. One of the reasons why I bought this particular one was because of the price- I wanted to pay MORE hoping for quality (i.e. ""You get what you pay for""). After less than one year, this cooker stopped cooking for me. I could press down the button to ""cook"" the rice but the red light did not come on and the orange ""keep warm"" light stays on constantly now. I looked up some internet info. to try and fix this thing but it's not going to work. I'm on Amazon now looking for a new one!One tip that worked well for me with this cooker was to rinse your rice several times through cold running water and then letting it sit for at least an hour before putting it to work. Also keep the water level down to no more than 1/4"" above the rice line or it'll come out too sticky."
3,Replacement is fine - QC so so,"Stand leg lengths were uneven causing cooker to precariously lean to one side, after one use it burned out - electrical smell, burnt rice, and electrical system shot. Poor workmanship and QC right out of the box.Amazon promptly sent a replacement - this one works great! The manufacturer needs improving quality control before releasing their product. Recommend as a purchase."
3,Great rice - lacking timer,"The rice was as terrific as others have said, but I realized the cooker didn't have the delay timer as I needed. Thought I could get by without the timer, but then I saw a rice cooker that had that option and gave it a try. The rice was just as good, so I returned the Zojirushi. The return was very simple through Amazon. I am very happy with the service I received with the rice cooker through Amazon, even though I decided not to keep it."
2,Poorly made!,I've had mine one year and use it gently. After the first month the plastic of the lid started separating and steam eascaping from the sides. The lid no longer fits well. It does work but for the price it shouldn't be falling apart.
5,Zojirushi Auto Rice Cooker and Warmer,"This product has met all my expectations. It is easy to use, fast and reliable cooking and very easy cleanup. The only advice I would give is to remember to empty the little container on the hinged side of the cooker, just below the lid hinge each time you use the cooker or it will fill up and spill over.I especially like the fact that the markings on the inside cooking container are in large print and clearly marked so it takes the guesswork out of measuring and hoping you've done it right!A good product I would recommend."
1,'Fraudulent' Pics Posted,"I gave this item the lowest rating possible. This was due to the fact that the item pictured was not what I received. It has been weeks, (now going into months) and I still don't have a tool to fit my Dyson vac. I have been told by Factory Direct that the pics seen on Amazon don't always match what a customer thinks they are purchasing. Since my purchase, Factory Direct has taken all accessory pics off their website and are not even listing on Amazon. They tell me they are going to find a tool to fit my Dyson so I can vac my hard floors. I am still in discussion with them over who is going to pay freight to send the 'wrong' tool back and if they are going to refund my $49.99. I realize this type problem is noted in Amazon's terms. Sooo, in the future, I will not make any more purchases from Amazon since they are not responsible for making sure what is pictured is what a person is buying."
5,Glad we came back,"My husband is the vacuum freak and I like the way he vacuums. Well he tried and got rid of my other dyson, well we went to a bag form of vacuum, needless to say we hated it. Glad were back"
1,attachment is a piece of junk,I love my Dyson vacuum because it works better than any other vacuum I've ever owned and I have spent more money on other vacuums and I have been disappointed until now. But the floor attachment is an overpriced piece of junk and I am being polite. Mr. Dyson should have made it differently because I am afraid of scratching my wood floors with this attachment.
4,Must have for wood and tile floors!,"When we purchased our Dyson, I read about this tool in some of the reviews and decided to purchase the Factory-Reconditioned unit and use the money we saved to get this accesory.This was a great choice, we love the vacuum and this tool does an outstanding job on our wood and tile floors. I think it does a great job on steps also. It has greatly expanded the functionality of the basic Dyson, and is well worth the extra cost."
3,Dyson Low-Reach attachment,"Much as I love my Dyson DC07 machine, I'm not terribly impressed by this attachment. Quite honestly, I think the other attachments that already come with the vacuum would be just as effective in reaching those areas under which the cleaner itself doesn't fit.The way this attaches to the hose -- well, it's not easy to keep the hose straight enough to be effective.Hard to explain, but I wouldn't recommend buying this until you've tried out the vacuum cleaner on its own. I expect this attachment will be gathering a lot of its own dust just sitting in the closet."
2,Not Great for Hardwood Floors.,"I first have to say how much I LOVE my Dyson vacuum. I was looking for a vacuum to sweep my hard wood floors better and could reach under furniture. This is awkward to use and it either pushes the dirt around or sucks to the floor so you have to bend down to lift just a little to get the right power. I would not recommend this, the bare floor setting for the vacuum cleaner works just fine. I am still on the hunt for a light weight sweeper that is great."
4,It does the job,"The attachment handle broke on it pretty quickly. It got a crack really, and I was too lazy to deal with returns to I put some duct tape and it seemed to do the job. My biggest problem is that there is no place to store. As far as picking stuff up, it does do a great job on the carpet and hardwood, it's the only reason why I gave it a 4 start. It does the job, but the functionality of it is not great."
4,Dyson,All I can say is my housekeeper loves it. She says it does a terrific job on both the carpets and hardwood floors. When she is happy I am happy. Regards. WS
3,Dyson floor tool attachment,The quality of the floor tool attachment is not as good as I would have liked to see based on how much you pay for the vacuum. It took us a while to figure out how to attach it to the vacuum. I bought it to use on hard wood floors and it doesn't work quite as smoothly as I would like. It seems to move a little roughly over the floors.
4,Great Attachment,I love the attachment. Expands the usefulness of the the Dyson Vacuum. For the premium price paid for the main unit it should have came as a free accessory. Any rate its great product.
2,Just Okay,"Not a very useful or practical ""how-to"" like I thought it would be. This book is more conceptual, when what I really wanted was a more instructional book."
1,"The book itself is great, however -","This book is fantastic. It's definitely the seminal text in medieval cultural studies, and everyone should have a copy who wishes to study this topic. The problem I have is with this precise edition: specifically, IT FELL APART IN MY HANDS THE FIRST TIME I WENT TO OPEN AND READ IT.Unfortunately for me, I had already passed the window to return it (that's what I get for ordering before a break). So I guess I'm stuck with this defective volume!"
2,Product Not as Advertised,"Product received is not as advertised. The bar is not the Pro 91 as shown in the picture and as stated. Part number 105699, as received, came with the Double Guard bar."
4,"16 clips of fights from movies, and they are all pretty good","I was rather surprised that I enjoyed this so much. I have seen all the fights before, except a couple. There was one with liam neeson as a boxer that I will have to check out. The rest are short clips from fights in movies like Fist of Legend, Rumble in the Bronx, and that retarded one from Timecop.Then as a bonus you have hong kong legend TSUI HARK doing a commentary. And since he worked on some of these movies, we get some very good insight. Not one of the better commentaries I have heard, but still very enjoyable.The rest of the extras are all minor but all fun. The best is a featurette on how to stage your own movie fights, stats on the fighters in these movies, and trivia.This disc is only 50 minutes long but does have good 5.1 sound, and it is something you will watch at least a couple of times."
4,Ultimate DVD,"This is the ultimate dvd for movie buffs. There are often times, you get into the mood to see a particular movie. But the truth is, you don't want to sit through the two hours of other stuff. You want to get into the nitty griddy, and get out. Ultimate Fights allows you to do this. Plus the commentary is fascinating. There are bonus features which show you how to stage your own fight. If you don't like a particular fight and want to loop it . . . like a jukebox, it allows you to pick your play list, and skip over the stuff you don't want to see again. With the techno track, it builds a foundation for playing at parites. It can easily fit in the background, and keep people entertained who love to sit around at parties (you know who you are). If you are a store owner, a bar owner, an party/event planner, a movie buff, or a fight fan, this is the Ultimate DVD!!"
4,"""AWESOME,"" says a GIRL...","Not only is Ultimate Fights every guy's dream, but this GIRL even likes it... A LOT. FlixMix has definitely selected the best fight scenes ever and put them all together in an INCREDIBLE DVD package. The extra footage alone makes the purchase worth every penny. I really am excited about Ultimate Fights--FlixMix indeed created a worthy sequel to its last release, Boogeymen. Not only have I memorized the whole DVD (the Snatch scene is my favorite), but I have quickly gained the attention of all of my guy friends...and the envy of all of my girl friends..."
1,Dissapointing,"The only 2 REAL ultimate fights on this is from Blade, and The legend of Drunken Master. I mean Scarface? Gladiator? SNATCH?! They are good movies, but those scenes DO NOT belong on an Ultimate Fights Dvd. Hopefully they can do a Vol.2 with Blade 2, Jet Li, Matrix, stuff like that FIGHTS! I don't want a dvd of brawls or a long crappy shootout."
1,Ultimately Stinks!!!!!-Ultimately a Rip-off!!!!!,"Don't waste your time or money on these cheap compilation D.V.D.'s.Buy the movies and watch the whole thing and enjoy what makes the ""Ultimate Fights "" such a great thing in the context of your veiwing experience."
1,Dietary Supplements and Multiple Sclerosis: A Health Professional's Guide,"Not a good review of supplements. Mostly a big-Pharma / AMA approach with warnings about how supplements might adversely affect pharmaceuticals. Prior to the big-Pharma approach to medicine, orthomolecular doctors were having as good of results as any of the pharmaceuticals can claim. This book does not make that information available to concerned people."
3,"Fun, but short lived","This is one of those toys that is lots of fun for a couple of days, but the kids soon lose interest. Well made."
5,This needs to be on DVD,"I remember watching every single episode while I was growing up. I LOVED IT!!!!! I strongly recommend that all the episodes be put on DVD, so I can add it to my collection."
3,Beauty and the Beast Series,"This series needs to be on DVD, NOW! Let's get those producers to get on the band wagon like everyone else. This is a very popular series and we want it on DVD. The tapes don't last. Mine are worn out. What is the hold up!?"
5,Where are the DVDs?????? I can't wait much longer. Sets of tapes are all worn out!,"Where are the DVDs? I'm STILL waiting! I want it all, but especially the second season.I'd rather not have them done on both sides of the disc. I want good quality discs, not too many episodes on each, please. However, I'll take what I can get. Just put it on DVD, PLEASE!"
5,Of love and hope.,"This incredible collaberation of triumph and trajedy, love and loss is a sure buy. With its moving performances and motivational stories of fantasy set in a modern day atmosphere, these episodes are sure to touch your heart. It's boldness explores parts of our world to beautiful to hide. If you enjoy poetic romances with compelling stories to deep for tears , this gift set is sure to meet your expectations."
2,Strange,"I got this book because of the cover, with many colors and a beautiful girl rowing her boat on water. But inside was completely different. The book was slow, boring, and unrealistic. The ending didn't seem complete, and most of the characters went undeveloped.I thought this wa going to be a good book, so I kept reading throughout the boring and slow parts, hoping to myself that it would become more exciting, or something would happen. But I found that the boring parts never ended, and the book just dragged on.So, don't read this book if your looking for an interesting one. Don't be seduced by the pretty cover. Remember, its the inside that counts."
4,Poetic and beautiful,"Just found a journal I kept back in 2002 for books that I read! In it I wrote that ZAZOO is slow moving. Expressive language-poetic. Young Vietamese girl adopted by French grandfather and brought up in France along a canal. Holocaust survivors, gentle helpers, romantic.Recommended for grades 6 and up. It is a very sophisticated beautiful book but not for reluctant readers."
4,Zazoo: Great Novel or Cheesy 1st Person-er?,"I've read some pretty cheesy first person novels in my life, and I expected Zazoo to be the same, but, well, it's not. Firstly, it has a complex plot with characters that interact with each other in the past and present-good thing. Second, it has a well-described setting, though the environment isn't necessarily well described-not exactly good, but it does help the reader focus on the story. Third, it well describes psychological issues faced by many people, and in Zazoo most of the issues are faced by the old men remembering their past. I think that some of that is just offensive, especially the `owls killing mice' parts. Overall, though, I think this book was pretty good. 4 stars."
4,A touching story,"I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was extremely well written. I liked the poem that continued throughout the story, that was probably my favorite part of the book."
2,Rather Disappointing,"I was interested in this CD for my infant daughter particularly because it has so many classic songs on it--many of which I've forgotten since I was young. However, the arrangements are pretty annoying; it's just not a pleasure to listen to. I'd suggest looking for something that's done better musically, even if the songs aren't standards. My daughter and I both enjoy Hap Palmer much more, for instance, even though his arrangements include new lyrics and interludes."
2,music,"I bought this for a my friend's son's 1st birthday because he loves it when his mom sings songs to him. I thought I'd give her vocal cords a break & increase his repertoire. Mom & Dad both dislike the CD BECAUSE it's got kids singing. (Most small kids don't care about staying in tune and it gets annoying if you have good pitch, which both parents do.) Nick isn't so sure yet but he may change his mind. This is not the CD to buy if you're going to play it in the car unless you like listening to small children sing (picture the little kids' choir from church or pre-school programs). Needless to say I will not buy this CD for any of my other friends who recently had children."
5,Very Interesting.,William Shatner explores the theory of the ancient astronauts as he meets & talks with serveral experts. This is a must for anyone interested in this subject. I remember watching this and many others on this subject as a child on TV and was & still am in awe. The possibility is real but are they really out there is the feeling you'll have after viewing this video.
5,A roller coaster ride through history - EXCELLENT,"This book opened my eyes to a part of history I should have known about but didn't. Although I am currently living in the US, I grew up in England; a country that is intertwined with the unfolding drama in this book. It is filled with facts and events that have shaped the world as we know it today, but reads like an adventure novel and not a text book. It gave me a feel for how triumphant, yet devastating at the same time, this period in India's history was. With it's descriptive narrative and easy to follow discussions of complex political situations, this book makes me feel as though I was almost there. I can not recommend this book enough."
5,AWESOME,A passionate and moving account of one of the world most under rated events! Wish I were there to witness such an exciting event. The best of Dominique's Master Pieces.
4,Mountbatten Autobiography,"I have to accept that this is one of the better books regarding India's early days. The authors are great narrator, and it sounds more like a novel. One of the major flaws in a book is that it is written to glorify Mountbatten. For example, initially the book goes through a great detail to explain that it was Mountbatten's idea to give Independence quickly. It explains that he fights with Churchill, and he goes against most of his colleagues to give India's freedom quickly. But later when Punjab is burning, the authors say that it was the Indian leaders' idea to give freedom quickly.I have to accept that I never read anything about Jinnah, Is he really as evil as he was portrayed in this book?The authors really did a good work on Gandhi. Each and every event, such as Congress stabbing him in the back, controlling the riot in Calcutta was written well.In conclusion, great book and a must read, but don't have your conclusion based on this book."
1,highly prejudiced,"The book has two heroes, Mountbatten and Mahatma Gandhi, some supporting roles like Nehru, Krishna Menon and villains like Jinnah and Godse. I guess the authors did not accurately put the case of Jinnah and Godse as to why they did what they did. The author is very selective when describing Mountbatten as a person to whom the so-called ""desperate and incompetent"" Indian establishment, used to fall back. If the main interviewee for the book is Mountbatten, obviously the hero is Mountbatten. Dominique Lapierre was a friend of Lord Brabourne, son-in-law of Mountbatten and suitably the story was aligned to what Mountbatten had views on."
1,Kindle Edition is worthless,"I have read this book many a times. Even if you doubt the facts and conversations citied, it is written exquisitely.HOWEVER, IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT AMAZON IS CHARGING ANY KIND OF MONEY FOR THE KINDLE VERSION! Not only that, THE KINDLE VERSION PRESENTLY AVAILABLE SHOULD NOT EVEN BE OFFERED FOR FREE!Had I know that it will completely ruin the reading experience, I would have never bought the Kindle version, especially since I already have the hard copy.Shameful and disappointing on the part of Amazon."
5,"Captivating, Eye Opener a must","My passion is historic related books, this have been one of the best ones I've read. The details the authors are able to give while having a smooth and easy read is incredible. After this book is a must to buy the Red Sari. II would say that in the west most people have little knowledge of the two biggest countries in the world India and China, the better we understand their history and their thinking it will be possible to understand why they act or do things differently. Understanding that there could be two different and valid angles to see the same problem will help us all have a better world.For China a must is Wild Swan, most of the real story of Mao is not known by the world."
2,Freedom at Midnight,"We ordered a paperback to take on our trip, but received a hard cover which we returned. The actual book (accortding to my wife) rates five stars. She found it to be an exciting and remarkable time in modern history."
2,Allright but not neutral,"This book looks at the events leading to and after the independence and partition of India in a western angle. Allots too many pages to Hindu rituals irrelevant to the subject. Majority of the content is based on Mountbatten's input. Claims that the British wanted to do good for India at the same time saying that they tried to make 576 parts of India. This should be named ""Mountbattens adventures in India"" rather than ""Freedom at Midnight"""
4,A must read for every Indian or anyone interested in India.,"History has never been so intriguing. Being an Indian I read the book from an Indian standpoint and for me it was an incredible experience. Having grown up in India I have been exposed to a lot of material about Independence but none have aroused such thought as ""Freedom at Midnight"". A masterfully written, superbly researched and above all a very human account of what happenned in that period of Indian History. Mountbatten comes across as the hero of India and though Gandhi is shown to be more human than saint his actions were definitely that of a Mahatma. This book gave me a better understanding of my own country. A must read for every Indian or anyone who is interested in India."
1,One-Man Self Aggrandizement,"This book is based on thirty hours of interviews granted by Louis Mountbatten to its authors. It is essentially a one-man version of how India won its independence. Reading this book, one would think that the ""white-knight"" Mountbatten rode into India to save the day, overlooking the fact that the British had subjugated those people, sometimes, brutally, for over a century. There are several better books which give a much more balanced and objective account of the Indian Independence without sounding like someone's diary or a sycophantic homage from a couple of grateful writers. Try the Oxford History of India."
5,Fantastic Story !,Excellent book about the events that led up to India's independence. Terrific and informative read for anyone eager to know about the history of a magnificent nation.
5,One-off Standout,"I heard a review of this CD on NPR (?) around the time it was released and ordered it, based on a few seconds of samples. I have had no regrets. I wish I'd heard of these guys when they were current! There are no good comparisons, but contemporaries like Devo and Pere Ubu come close. This music is of equal or better quality. The adrenaline rush of some of these songs is awesome, but the music AND lyrics are alternately intelligent and hysterically funny. The Embarrassment falls into a category in my collection: Superlative albums by bands that had too brief a career. I wish they'd survived a little longer..."
3,too much of a good thing,"Like alot of bands from the era the Embarrassment recorded alot of muic, some worthwhile, some not so great. I found a used copy of this a couple of years ago. I saved and burned a separate copy of ""Death Travels West"" (tracks 9-16 on the first CD of this set). I havent played this CD since."
4,CLINT BEING CLINT,"This was an action-packed movie with quasi-burned-out US Secret Service Agent Clint being hounded by bad, extremely evil guy John Malkovich. There are scenes of tenderness with Clint being supported by a lady agent, Rene Russo, and there are stereo-typed jerk bosses like Clint's supervisors and of course, the pompous Presidential Chief of Staff, played by Fred Thompson. There are many minutes of excitement and violence, building up to the final scenes in the elevator. Plus there are moments of fantasy and unforeseen circumstances where the partner is killed on the rooftops in a foot pursuit, and of course, no back-up or helicopters come into play. Near the end, even when Clint was wearing a bullet-resistant vest, a pistol shot in the chest can really slow you down bigtime - the huge bruises are ugly. But hey, it was Clint being Clint and it was a very entertaining flick..and he can run like a cheetah...also he can play the piano quite well."
3,John Malkovich absolutely carried Mr. Eastwood.,"John Malkovich, a man of theater and film, once again gives a splendid performance. Throughout the film, Malkovich carried and tamed Eastwood; like dog on a leesh. Give Malkovich his Oscar!"
2,Typical Souless Formulaic Hollywood Thriller,"Highly overrated and poorly written movie which essentially was a compilation of every cliche ever used in the thriller genre. These include the brilliant madman killer who makes taunting phone calls to the good guy cop, ""surprise"" plot twists, various disguises, horribly insipid dialogue, completely predictable ""romance"" between the older agent (Eastwood) and a much younger attractive Secret Service agent, etc... Of course the formula wouldn't be complete without some absurd plot contrivance designed to make the audience care about this drek- in this case, it is Eastwood's obsessive need to redeem himself 30 years after he botched the JFK security detail. Right. Anyway, its all been done so much better before. Rent Dirty Harry or Silence of the Lambs."
5,First-rate Eastwood,"This will become a classic. Clint delivers an excellent performance. Good drama/thriller/suspense flick. Malkavich plays an excellent villain. It's a definite must-watch, especially in Blu-Ray format. The video resolution details are just amazing. Enjoy."
4,In the Line of Fire,"Great movie and we enjoyed it very much. Clint Eastwood is a top notch actor, and did his usual good acting job."
4,Malkovich Steals The Show,"Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action-suspense film. I am not a particularly fan of his but I have to hand to him: he knows how to make entertaining movies. It didn't hurt, either, to have John Malkovich as his co-star. Now there is an intense actor!In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is fascinating to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialog he was given. He also has a interesting voice.Rene Russo is fairly low-key (for her), but that's fine and Eastwood plays the usual loner-cop role, not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all up in the end. I guess he couldn't stop playing the ""Dirty Harry""-type figures, but he played them well.There were some negatives this film, however, namely: credibility. The climatic scene, in particularly, had too many holes in it. There also were too many verbal blasphemes in here.Overall, however, this is good, escapist fare."
3,"Great movie, mediocre DVD.","The movie rates 5 stars, but the quality of the DVD brings the total package down to 3. There are absolutely no extras on this DVD. It's my guess that this is a ""first generation"" DVD that the studio released before they had any idea what to do with the format other than slap the movie on a disc and ship it. I base that guess by the only thing that can remotely be called an ""extra"" is a commercial at the beginning of the film remarking about how great the ""new"" DVD format is. Most of the movie clips shown are at least 10 yrs old. In fact, I think ""In the Line of Fire"" is the NEWEST movie clip and it's 7yrs old.The picture and sound are spectacular; but don't buy this DVD unless you're a diehard fan of Clint, John or Wolfgang. Consider renting it or buying it as part of the ""Wolfgang Petersen Collection"" (An outstanding package, by the way!) until a ""Special Edition: In the Line of Fire"" is released."
4,Leaves the reader wanting more,"Be prepared for an unorthodox view of books, authors, and the publishing world. There are numerous witty remarks. At times I felt like I was reading a book of literary trivia and was hungry for more detail and substance. There would be just a sentence or two that would really get my interest, then nothing more. Luckily the author has included a wonderful comprehensive set of notes for each chapter. The reader can then locate original sources. I read every word of the chapter notes, and will read several books and articles that were mentioned. The reader will find the individual chapters more or less interesting according to their own taste. The chapter on the Library of Congress was my favorite. I disliked the list of supposedly humorous ""advance praise"" quotes from historical figures, finding them to range from juvenile to in poor taste. The book is definitely worth the time, and the episodic nature of the chapters makes for good spare-moment reading."
1,"Casanova Was a Book Lover: And Other Naked Truths and Provocative Curiosities About the Writing, Selling and Reading of Books",It arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition. I would not hesitate to use this vendor again.
5,Great read for anyone interested in writing,"I'm a novelist and an independent publisher. I've been studying these things for ten years, and it's taken a close study because ""these things"" have been changing. After two centuries of glacial adaptation the digital age has forced a rapid change on the world of book publishing. At the same time, the world is seeing more writers than ever before, more books than ever before, and with these things comes a surprisingly widespread interest in the process of making books--whether that's a desire to participate in (and profit from) the process, or simply a curiosity concerning a favorite pastime. In Casanova Was a Book Lover John Maxwell Hamilton satisfies that curiosity with a fun, engaging, and remarkably in-depth description of the writing process."
4,Swing Plane: Ben Hogan Revisited,"Hank Haney explain in this book why the swing plance is so important for a good contact. He explains us why we have to revise the Ben Hogan's theory on the same subject.Hank Haney is a well-known instructor and helped a lot a well-known golfers ( O'Meara,Kuehne Kelly and Hank). Good investment for lowering your handicap."
2,"Same stuff, different book","This book is strictly average. The information is the same you would find anywhere else. Nothing new. If I had a chance to review this before I bought it, I would not have made this purchase."
3,Not the only lesson you'll ever need,"Good book, but suggest Steve Elkington's book instead. Go back to the fundamentals and stop over-analyzing your swing."
1,"After reading it, I still need to take another lesson.","Description of Mr. Haney's inventional teaching concept is pretty convincing. However, the pictures and how-to are hardly mentioned in the book."
3,An avid student,"I am a 50 year old struggling 25 handicapper who has finally decided to take lessons or quit. People, you can read 100 books on the golf swing, and I imagine some of you have, but you won't know what you're doing wrong without feedback. Take a golf lesson and have someone show you, through video, what is going on. Oh sure, there are some gifted athletes out there who can self improve just by reading a book. Not possible with an average person. In the long run lessons will be cheaper than buying books. I have read many books including all of Hank Haney's and I thoroughly enjoy reading them, but you can't fix what's broke without help- trust me. Go ahead and read the books, but take a few lessons and your game will take off. Improvement takes time, some money, and practice. With three lessons I have started scoring in the mid 80's. It is fun to play again. I can't wait to get out there and beat my best score."
1,"Re: ""Good Idea - Bad Execution's"" review of May 29, 1999","I agree with everything you said! I would like to confirm that the writing and/or editing needs improvement at the very least. I was irritated by the confusing phrases and clauses, and poor punctuation. It's hard to make any sense of what he's talking about (sorry).And thank God I didn't pay full price; I borrowed it from the local library and took it back."
1,Wipes turned to mush.,"These must have been sitting around for a very long time. The first box I received I opened on up and found a whitish/grey mush. I felt all of the other foil packs and they too had all turned to mush. I arranged a replacement order with the vendor and this second box had the same issue. Since then they were going to send me a RMA but I have yet to receive it or my refund. NOTE: This is a comment on the vendor more than the product... I've used these for several years and they work great. But, they must be able to wipe!"
4,Incompetent Promoted,"The real Ernst Udet was absolutely out of his depth after being named as head of the Office of Air Armament in 1939. The 26 separate offices under his direct command were staffed by over 4,000 Luftwaffe officers. Udet, who was the highest ranking WWI ace, became a stunt pilot after the war. He had no technical background whatever. He was promoted as a friend of Goering. His production figures and projections were false. He did not know what was going on in the Office of Air Armament. He was a drug addict and a heavy drinker. On the 17th of November 1941 he shot himself.While the film is pure propaganda fiction I recommend it. Curt Jurgens, who was sent to a concentration camp by Goebbels, is an outstanding actor playing the fictional Colonel-General Udet. The support cast is also superb. BUY THIS FILM!"
5,one of the best resource out there.,"if your an electrical / process engineer, this is one of the must have books."
2,Poor binding,Binding of the book is very bad that you cannot open the book completely or even cannot see end of the lines. And paper quality is poor.
3,the hood,"Works well, however it does not clip in like a Canon. This is easy to cope with for the money saved."
4,Lens Hood for Canon EF 28-135 3.5-5.6 IS Lens,"I purchased this hood and found it to be well constructed and design like the Canon brand. Other than it stating on the Hood, ""Designed for Canon"". Rather than, Made by Canon, I found no significent difference in look or funtion. I am looking forward to using other products by Precision Design as their line of products are well constructed and funtion as well as the name brands of the equipment that they are intended to be used on."
3,Some assembly required,"When I first got this as many of the other reviews mentioned it did not fit on my 28-135 USM lens at all in the forward position. Incedentally it fit fin in the reverse storage position. After being a little frustrated I got some 150grit sand paper and sanded down the back side of the hood on a flat surface. Blow off the dust with canned air and now it fits perfectly. Should you have to do this with a new hood, absolutly not, but hey it is only $6"
1,Doesn't Fit Right,I lined the hood up to the threads on the lens and tried to put it on. It didn't turn very easily and I was turning harder than I thought I should. I was only able to turn it about a quarter turn and you could see that it wasn't sitting right on the lens. I tried multiple times before I just gave up. Gonna order the Canon one instead. Luckily this was only 6 bucks. Waste of money.
4,Hood Not Felted,"The description does not mention that the inside of hood is not felted, and I didn't read the reviews before purchasing this hood. I have to trust it's going to be fine since other reviewers have said it hasn't been an issue yet. It does appear to be roughed up or bead blasted on the inside to reduce light reflections. It hasn't been sunny in my area so I can't test the reflective qualities of the material yet. Considering that this hood is only a fraction of cost of the canon, I think it's probably a safe buy for casual photographers. If your a pro and your reputation is on the line, go with the cannon. I have to think that canon puts felt on the inside for a good reason."
1,Don't buy junk/ Buy Canon,"I purchased the off brand lens hoods for my 28-135 lens from Amazon because of the cost. I thought lens hood, any brand would work. When the lens hood came and I tried to get it on the camera lens I realized my mistake.I could not get it to screw on and off the lens with a lot of work. I sure did not want to be twisting and pulling on the end of my lens. I sent it back and got the Canon lens hood. It screws right on and off without any problems which is what you would expect from canon."
1,Poor imitation,"I should have bought the Canon brand hood. This one looks good, but the fit is very tight. I may have to file the edges in order to make it fit. Cheap copy... Lesson learned."
1,"Its cheap in price and quality, don't buy","Its catchy the way they advertise this on Amazon with it imprinted as ""made for Canon."" Neither the box nor the hood actually says that. It is made from thin plastic and it was extremely poor fitting, not a perfect circle. It was not even worth the $4 to return the $6 hood. No click like Canon Hoods. I had it for 42 or so days before it just split from end to end on its own while on the camera sitting on a shelf. Obviously there are also quality control issues with this manufacturer. The Canon made hood is 3x the price, but hopefully it will last longer than 42 days."
5,Satisfied customer.,"When I received the first hood, it didn't fit right. Laptopmate proactively contacted me and replaced it with one that works. Excellent customer service from Laptopmate. Will definitely buy from them again. For the price, it's worth giving this a try."
1,DO NOT BUY,"It simply will not fit on my lens (see many other reviews with the same compalint). It fits nicely when inverted for storage. But when you need it, it will encroach upon your field and you will have to take it off. There is about a 20-30 degree off-set when you ""seat it"". Throwing it away is cheaper than sending it back.Just like Vizzini ( The Princess Bride) didn't know what ""inconceivable"" meant......nor do I believe that this company knows what ""Precision"" means...."
1,not worth it,"I bought this for my Canon 28 to 135, trying to save a few bucks from the over priced Canon hood. It took a while for me to even get it started, when it finally caught it was so hard to rotate it around I though I was going to break the lens . I put it back in the box and returned it"
2,"Good, until I dropped it.","I was relatively happy with this hood until I accidentally dropped it (just the hood) and it broke. It was dropped from about 3' onto a tile floor. I guess you get what you pay for, but for a $7.00 piece of plastic, I still expected it to be a little more durable than this."
2,Get what you pay for.,"Seems quite durable not flimsy in any way. But the fit is off. It is way too tight, i am afraid to damage the lens when putting it on and taking it off. I will be shipping it back and buying the Canon brand."
2,some interesting points,If you are looking for new ideas and skills then just go toward chapter five because their is wealth of information. But if you are planning to get new insights or a basic storyline from it then it's very incoherent.
4,OEM HEadset,These are much better in sound quality than generics. I highly recommend this headset if you own a samsung phone.
4,Not a typical Joel's movie,"Honestly I don't like the director. Most of his movies are bad because they have no color.Anyone can make like he does if he has experiences, I thought.But surprisingly his movies like Flatliners and 8 mm, they are different.They look like the director's true voice. I can see his passion making them.I persinally think this is his best film.Video audio quality so so. If you have DVD, don't change it into Bluray.Since I have VHS, I changed into Bluray cause it's cheap."
4,Movie memories,I enjoyed this blast from the past movie. This movie came out way before forensics was even a popular television genre. This was the I.D. movie of my time.
5,Adding to my collection,"This is the most recent addition to my Kiefer collection. Some of his early films are more difficult to find, but ""Flatliners"" is still popular. The Brat Pack were in rare form for this one."
3,Not a bad movie...,"This was alright. I kind of enjoyed the cinematography and visuals on this movie. The acting needed a little help especially Billy Baldwin, he just bothers me. The concept of this movie is very interesting though and the movie itself is definitely worth giving a look."
1,22 Subtitles Language and no Spanish,Why are Sony so stupid? 22 different subtitle tracks and no Spanish track. Unbelievable !
5,UNFAIRLY CRITISIZED MASTERPIECE,"I don't understand why some reviews are so hard on this movie! I have been a die-hard fan of Kiefer Sutherland since ""Stand By Me""! (""24"" didn't exactly change that!) Kevin Bacon & Julia Roberts are great, also, as always. Contrary to some reviews, Kiefer doesn't get the idea to ""simulate"" death, he, & his classmates in turn, DIE & come back. The ctach is, they bring their sins back physically, & they're unhappy! Keifer's (Dr. Death) provides the biggest thrill, & suspense, of this movie. When I first saw this at the Joy's Panorama, it scared the SH - heck out of me! 15 years later, I find it didn't lose any punch. Do yourselves a favor: for young acting brilliance, scary suspense & fun, check this one out!"
1,CHANGE THE COVER ART BACK AND I'LL BUY IT,"Why did they screw with the original cover art of this movie? The European version is the same...why does the U.S. market change the original covers (i.e., ""The Exorcist,"" ""Pretty Woman,"" etc.) when releasing these older movies on dvd or blu-ray? Irritating."
4,compare with SAVED BY THE LIGHT,"Compare this movie with SAVED BY THE LIGHT: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF DANNION BRINKLEY starring (co-incidently) Eric Roberts. Both handle the subject of experiencing (first hand), after death, the pain you have caused others. I cannot decide which one is better, perhaps the latter."
2,THIS MOVIE HAS A GREAT CAST BUT THAT'S ALL FOLKS!,"IT HAS JULIA ROBERTS, KEIFER SUTHERLAND, (YES THEY WERE AN ITEM THEN), KEVIN BACON, AND WILLIAM BALDWIN. THESE PEOPLE ARE THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE, EVEN KEIFER WAS SOME WHAT BELIEVABLE IN THIS. TOO BAD, THE MOVIE STUNK. IMAGINE MAKING YOURSELF, OR OTHERS GO INTO A FLATLINE, JUST TO SEE WHAT IT IS LIKE TO BE DEAD? SOUNDS GOOD. SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD, BUT IT MISSED BIG TIME. THEY EACH BRING EACH OTHER BACK-TO BAD THEY COULDN'T DO THE SAME WITH THIS MOVIE."
1,NO MORE WIDESCREEN !,"Great movie, my complaint is with the widescreen ... I will NOT buy another widescreen DVD. I have spent thousands of dollars on big tvs, home theatre systems and nice big comfy couches to watch the movies i buy on and i want the movie to view on the full tv screen, i mean what's the sense of buying big tvs and only using one fourth of the screen ????????? Everyone i talk to agrees with me so i don't understand why i keep seeing widescreen. I dont know who was the person who started this widecreen thing but they should b shot and then hung! I have movies that at least give me the option of full or wide screen but most are only widescreen. This has stoped me from ordering my full movie list of about 30 movies...and i will not buy them if not FULL SCREEN. Please bring back FULL SCREEN DVDs or at least give us the option to choose widescreen or full screen on the manu. Thank you"
1,Gormet dog food,"Great cast, great cinematography, great acting, horrible movie. If you liked this movie you are sick."
4,good movie ..but blu ray not so good,"This is a really good movie with a great message and the acting is superb, almost everyone in this movie when on to become stars... I don't know why it doesn't get higher ratings by critics and reviewers, because its definitely in my top 20 for best movies....however the blu ray transfer is terrible it is really no better than the DVD version so if you already have this movie on DVD don't bother getting the Blu ray because it really isn't any better also if you can get the DVD for a better price than the blu ray get the movie on DVD....the blu ray is not worth the extra price."
2,flatliners was too scary for me,This was okay for the older kids. They love stuff like that. I'm a squishy and don;t like stuff like that
4,Lil man just loves the fact that he can carry all his cars around with him,"When my son received his case, he was in heaven!!! He started going thru all his cars and putting them away in his case. When anyone comes to visit, he immediately goes and gets his car case to show off his cars. In fact, we liked it so much that we asked Gma for the monster truck case and he got it!!!"
3,Car case damage,"the products privide order to my boy's hotwheels car; but the case is damage.The product is portable, can contain direrent car size and help to preserve toys."
3,It holds alot cars!,This holds alot match box cars!!!You can put over the amount of cars it says if you double them in the case!!
5,Best Hot Wheels case ever.,"I bought this for my 20-month old grandson, after we started supplying him with Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars. He seems to enjoy putting the cars in and taking them out of the case."
4,Hot Wheels Carrying Case is good for organization,"You're going to need this if you buy hot wheels. This is a convenient way to store and carry hot wheels. My 2 1/2 year old gets excited every time he opens the case and sees the numerous cars inside. It should be noted that the case can potentially hold more than 48 cars if you have some of the slender hot wheels because they can be doubled up in the slots, which is especially important to me because my husband has a bad hot wheels shopping habit. :)"
4,Hotwheels,My son has collected so many hotwheels cars that it is difficult to keep them all together. This is a wonderful way to store all the loose cars. I wish it would hold up to 100 cars instead of having to buy a second case.
1,Great value,I bought this item because I could not find a hot wheels carrier anywhere. When I did find it somewhere it was cheaper for me to buy this one and have it shipped than it was for me to go and purchase it from a retailer. I filled it with hot wheels and my grandson carries it everywhere.
1,Took way to long.,I ordered this product for my son for christmas on Dec.16 didnt get it untill jan.the car case was a important part of my sons christmas since i bought cars to go in the case.
1,Do NOT BUY THIS!,My bro slamed his case you the wall and it broke into a million pices!Even one of his cars broke.Plus no cars came with it. but cool case look.
4,Not happy with your available info on site and packaging,"My son loves his new track, but I am having a real hard time finding out which cars can go on this specific track and if it can be amplified with other tracks. Info on all tracks is very unclear for a person who is not too familiar with Hotwheels. It took me ages to find out which tracks were electrical, motorized or just tracks. There is hardly any info on the site of Hotwheels and believe me, we have spent hours there browsing. I finally ended up buying Serpent Cyclone because it was the one that appealed most to my 5 year old because of the photos, but it was just a wild guess it would be okay for him. It says some hotwheels cars can't go on the track, but it turns out most can't run on it. I think packaging should be more specific, both of tracks and cars, indicating for which tracks they are suitable and the tracks, with which other tracks they can be amplified, if any. Right now it is a lot of guesswork and searching."
2,Hot Wheels Car Carrier is so-so,"I bought 2 of these so my son wouldn't leave cars all around the house where I could (and usually did) find them at 2 AM by stepping on them. One case was fine, but the other had a bent lid that didn't latch. I did some low-tech bending of the plastic lip so that the latch would catch the wedge on the side of the case, which seems to help, but I wouldn't rely on it not coming open while going upstairs. The easy solution was to teach my boy to carry the case horizontally. Still, they work and hold most cars in a neat and orderly fashion."
1,Poor quality,"I was so excited to get this for my son and his many cars, but the large sticker on the front of the case had a huge crease down the middle and looked cheap. Returned it."
3,Gets the job done,"Stores all the cars, about what you expect. The plastic latch broke though, after a few months. Victim of a reckless 4 year old, maybe."
5,Hot Wheel Cases,"The Hot Wheel cases were just what I wanted. I have many hot wheels and this was a good price for them. Also not having to pay shipping. They came very well packaged. Have no complaints what so ever. Thanks again, KK"
4,Hold lots of cars,Both my sons got these for christmas. They are still holding up today. Better than cars all over the place!!
4,Super,"My toddler really loved it! It's a fun way to keep the cars organized. The thing is that the case isn't that practical, can't hold the cars when standing... I read about that but still went on and bought it. For educational purposes, I think it's all right ;-)"
3,carrier,"Yes, it is a nice carrier for minicars. It is a little thin,andd easily breakable. I gave it to my grandson."
4,Works Great,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old to keep all his loose cars. It fits a lot of different types of cars, not just Hot Wheels. He can't open the case by himself but that works for us. He brings it over to us so we can open it. It is better than having it fall open easily. He loves taking the cars out and putting them back in the slots. The price is great for what you are getting."
1,Not for a child under 5! Poor construction and design!,I purchased this case for my 4 year old nephew. He loves matchbox cars and he loved this case however the hinges on the door are crap!the case door keeps falling out of it's hinges and my nephew isn't very coordinated and is unable to put back together.Needless to say I returned this product for a full refund and purchased a Lightening McQueen car case for 1/2 the price! He loves it and the hinges stay intact. Note: Do not purchase Hot Wheels car case with bottom wheels/without wheels. Both are constructed with the same style door hinge.Hot Wheels car cases are a hassle for both you and your little one. I do not recommend purchasing this product.Hope this is helpful!
3,A good idea but not well constructed,"I thought this case would be a great storage solution for the many cars that are crammed into a clear storage box with no organization. My son loves pulling his ""suitcase"" around the house, but seldom does it contain cars. One simple reason: it doesn't work. The partion that should hold the cars in place is a flimsy piece of cardboard that can be removed and almost always falls out on its own. Without the partition in place the cars don't stay in the molded compartments. We still use the clear container for car storage."
3,more than just a carrying case......,"My son loves to put his Hot Wheels into the slots and then dump them all out.Also, it's fun to prop up one side of the case and have cars drive down - especially thru an empty paper towel roll.It's been in our home since December and is still in one piece, which is more than I can say for some other toys we've gotten for him.We've got friends with a child a month older than mine and he's got about five or six of these, filled with cars and trucks and they're all in great shape."
4,Hot Wheel case,Nice for the price. Three year old can handle it and keep cars togetherin one place. Happy with the find.
5,Keep 'em Organized,"I have bought several of these cases over the years. My boys are now grown, but wanted to keep their Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars, so I purchased several of these cases. They are rigid and well made and hold all but the longest and tallest of the small vehicles. I would recommend them to anyone who wants to organize their Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars, even if it's just for storage and not just from playtime to playtime. I'm quite happy with my cases!"
4,You get what you pay for,"[The cost of this ]should tell you about it's durability. My son loved this case and pulled it around everywhere including up and down stairs and everywhere a 3 year old boy thought it should go. Needless to say it didn't last long.The partition came loose. The plastic hinges cracked one by one until it wouldn't hold together any more. This all happened in less than a year.Also, for a kid who loves fire trucks, construction vehicles and monster trucks there just aren't enough large slots to fit the vehicles."
1,Not so durable,"Once the 2 sides of this case come apart they never stay back together. It looks like it's supposed to snap on and off but the plastic doesn't stay the same after. Not so good for the younger kids that like taking things apart. Also, the way that it shuts isn't so great as it's not reliable."
2,Not what I expected,"I've actually ordered this product 4 times... the first 2 times I received exactly what I expected: a car case that has 44 small slots and 1 larger slot(monster truck size). It was absolutely perfect for all my boys hot wheels. The last two times I ordered it I received what looked like the same case (same cover and everything) but this time it only had 15 large slots. I assumed the manufacturer mixed up some lids for their cases since they do sell the monster truck case as well, so I sent it back and ordered another. I got the same case again with the 48 car case cover, but slots for monster trucks. This time I called amazon to see what the deal was..they told me ""cases may vary"" and that they couldn't guarantee I'd get what I expected. I sent that one back and just went to ToysRus where I got what I needed (with slots for 48 cars). If you have a lot of those monster trucks, this case is perfect..otherwise you'll be shoving 4-5 cars into each slot. Buyer Beware."
2,Its ok,"I have found other car Carry cases made by the same company are better, they can hold larger vehicles, such as Semi's and limousines. This case can not hold such large vehicles, its good for most other cars. Its ideal for larger cars like vans and truck but its not that suitable for cars, it has too much room. They can becomed scratched and what not."
5,hot wheel case,I love the hot wheels case. it's great to have so many hot wheels in one place. The service was great also.
2,Disappointed,This product arrived with some scratch marks on the back of it. I returned it and received a prompt refund. Had to buy a more expensive one due to needing it right away.
4,Hot Wheels Car Case,My grandson had his little cars all over the place. Now he keeps them all together in the box.
4,Not sure how long this will last...,"My son has a ton of Hotwheels and Matchbox cars, and I haven't found on yet that doesn't fit in the spaces. But I'm not sure how long this case is going to hold up. The lid is rather flimsy, and makes a loud clicking noise when opened and shut. I got this on sale from Amazon for around $8 so for that price it's worth it, but I would have preferred a little more effort had gone into those side clasps."
2,Poor design,"It is beyond me why this company would design a case where the cars are not secure when a toddler picks them up. If the case isn't completely closed then the cars will go everywhere as soon as it is picked up. When I was a kid, you could find cases where the cars sat in stack-able boxes horizontally. This storage system is vertical and there is nothing to secure the cars. Stupid, stupid design."
5,A lasting toy...,"I got my son his first case at age 2 and it survived the terrible 2s. Now at almost age 9 with 2, still, intact cases and a history of 2 other brands (no longer with us)... will purchase more of the Hot Wheel case to replace the overflowing shoe boxes he is now using to store his cars."
2,Kid with a view,"I thought my three-year-old car enthusiast would love this. He hates it! He pulled the cars out faster than I could put them in. I finally figured out that he like to view his ""collection"" and bought a clear-viewed sorter for him."
4,this is NOT a 48 car case......,"this is a great hot wheels case.BUT be aware you are NOT buying a 48 car case.look at the picture next to the case, there are only like 15 separated boxes for cars in this box.ours has 39 separate openings.when we bought ours last christmas, the picture showing that there were not 48 slots for cars was not there so we were expecting a box with 48 separate slots.so when we got ours, i was and still am disappointed, but at least now there is a pic on here showing that it is NOT a 48 slot box.it is overall a good, high quality box."
3,"Review, but very interesting","Anyone that is a beginer, or just wants to know how to snowboard, should read this book. It informs you on how to snowboard on a basic level. Some of the things it teaches you is carving, falling the correct way, ollieing, and tricks. This book also gives information in different types of snowboarding, such as slalom racing, boardercross, hafl pipe, and dryslope competition.For me, being a snowboarder for three years, going on four, I only give the book three stars, because I already know most of the information the author is trying to give you. For me, this was like a review type book, but i still thought that it was interesting."
4,Sweeping historial romance from 1919 through 1952,"Sakkara, now out of print, is an engaging story of a man and woman from two separate cultures growing up together as neighbors in a swiftly changing Egypt. The sweeping historical romance begins in Egypt in 1919 and spans through the independence of Egypt. If you can find it-read it!!!"
3,3.5 stars - A fun book.,"The plot is light but the characters are wonderful. You truly get to know Terry and his friends as you join them in their day and work. There's very good dialogue and light humor. It's heavy on profanity, but not inappropriate for the characters. I read the first in the series and will probably keep following Terry and the gang. This is a fun, quick read."
4,Oldie but goodie!,Classics are the best. I remember watching this as a kid. Was fun to watch it again so many years later.
3,Okay Star Trek Movie,This movie isn't as bad as they say. It's pretty fun to watch although it's not the best Star Trek movie either. The DVD specials are pretty cool. If you like Star Trek you should pick this up.
1,BIG BROTHER is watching...,"WARNING - This album is NOT complete. It has been censored. It is NOT worth the money since you are NOT receiving what the artist(s) recorded. A song titled ""Pussy Galore"" should have the word ""pussy"" in it? Rather it's ""-BLANK- Galore"" that is repeated again and again. In addition the word ""asses"" is also removed. Thanks Amazon.com for screwing me. I want my money back."
2,Edited,"Buyer beware, this is the edited version of the album which isn't very clear since Amazon only marks if the albums are explicit, and in this case, they don't offer that version.While it's not a huge deal for many of the songs, it renders others (like The Seed 2.0) pretty much unlistenable."
1,This is the CLEAN VERSION of the album,"Oh how I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased Phrenology as an MP3 download. Even though there is no clue in the description this is an edited, clean version of the album. It is NOT the original album. If you think you're getting what the artist intended you to hear you're wrong. If you like to hear silence instead of certain words then by all means spend your money here. BUYER BEWARE!!"
1,Always falls down,"This item worked fine only initially; comfortable and stabilized my knee. In a short amount of time, about 2-3 months, it began falling down. At first I could adjust it and it might last 1-2 hours. That shortly degraded into not staying up at all. I would not recommend this item."
2,Won't stay in place - keeps slipping down to ankle,"It won't stay in place if you move around alot so any activity is out of the question. If you are going to wear them to sit with your legs elevated they are fine. Otherwise they slide down to your ankles. I was able to get it to stay somewhat but I had to have it so tight that it was a bit painful.In short, I was disappointed with the product."
3,Beware of sizing,Different companies use different sizing standards. It is best to look up the individual companies and find how the company decided on the size. This is marked a 5x so i expected it to be quite large when in fact it was not. Although with adjusts of added velcro it did work out. I did have to reinforce the product in some sewing spots as the sewing began to unravel after a few days of wearing the product.
4,knee brace,"Knee brace was just as described, except for the sizing. The small brace still ended up being too large for my daughter & had to be returned. I think an extra small woul've been perfect."
2,meh.. could be better,I received it in excellent time. However according to the sizing chart it said I needed a 5x. This was huge!!!! As in couldn't keep it up no matter how tight the straps were huge. So the sizing runs a bit big. Overall quality seemed ok but the primary reason it was returned was because the stitching on the side of one of the hinges was completely missing causing the hinge to pop out. Outside of that it appeared to be good quality.
1,Poor fit,I was very dissapointed first the 4xs made by this company in the other models are larger then the 5xs in this model which did not seem to make sense. aslo the brace always sliped off after a few steps I had read this in another review but did not take it to heart.
3,To soon to judge.,I haven't noticed any significant change in my skin yet. I will continue to use it for a few more month's before I can give it my honest opinion.
5,"Great, corrosion resistant, strings","Love these strings. I use them exclusively on my Gibson LP Studio Deluxe because it seems to corrode ordinary strings quickly. I have a washburn with a glossy, sealed looking fretboard, that doesn't have that problem, but still prefer these strings for it as well. They tend to be a little stiffer than ernie ball's, but I like the way they sound and they feel great when bending and sliding. I can keep these on my guitar for weeks of daily playing without the corrosion and deadness that I get with other brands."
2,Strings break too easy,"Putting on these strings was very simple, but two strings broke when I put them on. I went to the store and bought another pack, put them on and within 2 hours of playing I broke another string that was bought from Amazon. I'm not sure if they were old when they were shipped, but I won't buy them again. They sounded good for the two hours they were on."
5,No hassles.,I received brand new electric guitar strings as stated and within a week from ordering. Thank you for a hassle-free sale.
1,Elixir Disappoints,"I play at least ten hours a week, and typically change strings once a month. They get thoroughly cleaned after each session. Thought I'd try the Elixir strings (mediums) to see if they'd hold their tone better between changes than what I had been using. The experiment was very disappointing. When new, the tone wasn't as full as it was with my regular (much less expensive) strings, and what tone there was began to deteriorate in just a few days. In fact, the high E string already displays rust spots. After one week with these overpriced, underperforming strings, I'm changing back to economical, great sounding D'addario nickel mediums tomorrow."
4,Strings good -- Amazon bad...,"Of the eight items I have ordered through Amazon, only the books have been satisfactory purchases. I recommend sticking to what you do well. Unless you want to stock these non - book items and, hence, be responsible for stocking and delivery (and communicating with the customer!), but that wouldn't be economically worth your while. The products that I did receive were as advertised with the exception of the strings. As these are coated strings and so don't corrode like regular guitar strings these were okay, but it was in packaging the company hasn't used in years. Had I ordered a set of Martins or Fenders I would have had to return them. I guess you could say you were lucky. That's not Amazon's doing, but it is inevitable that such things happen when you agent drop - shipping for other sellers.I might buy some other books from you sometime. Maybe a CD or DVD.But nothing else."
1,Not good at all,"I bought a few sets of the elixirs because Suhr uses these as there standard string. These strings took all the fullness and rich tone out of my all mahogany guitar, they provide almost a fake new sounding quality if that makes sense. Even though these strings last longer, I can get pretty much the same amount of life out of a set of D'addarios just by wiping the strings down after playing. Don't waste your money get some Rotosounds or D'addarios they sound miles better!"
1,No Good,bought it for the song: the church on cumberland road....didnt even sound the same as the one they play on the radio and none of the other songs were any good. played it twice and havent touched it since
3,have a thick skin,as a woman this was hard for me to watch the women and children being abused. but it was an ok film.
5,THIS THING BLOWS !,"I purchased this as a means of ventilating a soundproof generator box. I put a 13,000-watt generator into a concrete/homasote-lined plywood box, and I needed something that would move a lot of air. I had already tried other means, such as a pair of 8-inch duct fans, but they didn't move nearly enough air. This blower is so powerful that it is somewhat difficult to hold by hand (because of the thrust); I was able to feel the wind from it from across the yard! I remember using something like this on the submarine I was on a while back. They were called Red Devil blowers, and we used them for evacuating smoke and fumes from spaces. They were very powerful, and I was hoping that this would be like them; it is. It keeps my generator box interior at 85 degrees (on an 83-degree day), which is fantastic!"
4,An excellent background to the reign,"It was a well written summary of the age, and the monarch, which I enjoyed thoroughly. His knowledge is admirable and I was fascinated to discover that Henry was a much wilier bird than I had realised. An excellent background to the reign, which is a period of history in which I have long been interested. It explains the Reformation and the break from Rome in detail, and how popular Henry was for most of his reign; making money, and living in peace, took precedence over the Pope and even if Henry's motives were rather more personal his subjects nevertheless supported him."
1,Flaws throughout the whole book,There are question marks and then page numbers from the original book throughout the entire book. Doesn't Amazon even check these ebooks out before it puts them on their site?
2,an adapted version,"Be aware - this is an adapted version! I was not aware of it when I bought the item - it does not say so clearly anywhere in the book description, only in the reviews. ""Through the looking Glass And What Alice Found There"" that it is paired with is not an adapted version, though"
1,¿A mischief?,I got really disappointed when I received the book. I was looking for the original Lewis Carrol Book and this one was an adaptation for Children.I feel truly decieved with Amazon.
3,Alice in Sillyland,"Alice in Wonderland is about a girl that falls in a hole and goes into this magical world. I think ""Alice in Wonderland"" is an OK book for my age if you like fantasy books. You may not like it because nothing makes sense. For example, they have a trial where the witnesses don't know about the crime and the Judge says to the jurors, ""That's important!"" but the Rabbit corrects him. I think it would have been a better book if I was 7 and my mom was reading it to me right before bed. The only problem with that is that younger kids might not understand much of the vocabulary but they might still enjoy it if you explain the words to them. If you're an adult and want a good book for your 5, 6 or 7 year old, I recommend Alice in Wonderland."
3,"Good selection, not really 'C' edition","The choice of songs is good with expected traditional songs. There was one missing ""Do you hear what I hear"". I'm a bit upset in that they preferred key of 'D' to key of 'C' in most cases. Two songs I looked at published in Eb and one in E. Both keys are not suitable for true 'C' instruments, the melody lines easily accomodated shifting down to D or even C on all the songs."
3,Slightly disappointed,"Print is a little too small, and arrangement of tunes is just so-so, but still possible to embellish chords, if you play an instrument that has both treble and bass."
4,A Journey Thru Human History,"Ritchie Calder, the award winning scientist for the United Nations, tells the story of human history from the cavemen to modern day societies. His gift of explaining scientific details combined with his knowledge of archeology, botany, and social sciences deliver a concise and important work of historical analysis. The book is easy to read yet opens up the progress of humankind from firekeepers to space travellers. This book is recommended for scientists but is written for anybody who thirts for knowledge of the evolution of the human being, his inventions and his social progress."
5,Excellent,I would recommed this book to everyone. We sometimes make things more complicated then they need to be. It was life changing information.
5,A Delightful witty send up of The Old Dark House,"Cry for the Moon, has widowed Marielle Brandt moving into an apartment house with her small child. Her husband was into big debt for his death and this is the only piece of property left to her. She arrived to find the place like something out of the Adam's Family, nearly falling down and the only thing that is keeping it running is Simon Zebriskie, who has taken on protecting the oddball inhabitants of the ancient building. It is haunted, has the weird crew of misfits, yet Marielle finds Simon and the Adam's Family mansion, her new home and is strangely charmed by it all. As great tribute to the Old Dark House!!"
3,Interesting Discoveries,its nice to learn how some logos are developed and how much they have evolved throughout time. it also gives some insight on the designers thinking process as they designed the logos. not a lot of pages tho.
5,"Strong licks, toe-tapping tempos, and superior musicians....","Strong licks, toe-tapping tempos, and superior musicians combine to make this a truly enjoyable musical experience! My Daddy will receive this as a gift for his brithday with all my love!"
4,A quartet with a nu flava,"This is a great CD, I was not a Cantons fan until I listened to this CD. The Canton are not your normal quartet group, this CD shows how the canton sing the traditional down-home gospel with a new up-to-date swing. This CD also shows how the Cantons works with other gospel artists like Melvin Williams of the Williams Brothers. I recommend this CD not only for older adults but for young people like myself who don't normally listen to traditonal gospel."
5,What a blessing.,"The Cantons' are truly a blessing to me. God really chose the right fellows to pass his word on. They are so real. And Harvey, I have all respect for you. I have never seen a man who loved his father as much as you. Your music is like medicine to me.It makes me feel better when I'm down. Thank you all. You're the best of the best."
5,Enjoyable listening,I listen to this CD over and over and so does my husband. It is a CD that will inspire and motivate you to do better and to help others.
4,Brilliant,"To compare this album to the intense frenzy of King Crimson is to miss its point. This is a brilliantly sarcastic collection of pop tunes. It's psychedlic only to the point that it makes fun of the genre and moves beyond it. The musicianship and the sound engineering are top-notch.The humor is as dry and sharp as it is intelligent. This CD is a must for fans of the irreverant with a need for something mentally stimulating as well.If you like The Dukes of Stratosphear (aka XTC), you'll love this."
4,Great Value,This product is a little slow in running on XP but well worth the money. I am a college student again after many years and I am using these programs to review and strenghten my skills.
4,Algebra 2 Software,"This product is good from beginning to end. If students use the software as a study tool, the student may improve their knowledge in Algebra 2. I purchase this product for my son. It assisted him in learning topics needed for class. If students are self-learners then this is perfect, but if the student need further assistance then this product may help or may not if face to face help is required. The reason, I give this four stars, is because the animation needs work, it is a traditional format without the bells and whistle. Some students need the animated stimulation, and this product is an early edition of computer programming. So take care in your decision to purchase, this one of the situations where you get what you pay for, but the content is worthwhile. Assessments are included as well for practice."
4,A great book for the novice project manager,"A great book for the novice project manager and a good refresher course for those of us who are already doing it. There's more to project management than just drawing Gantt charts. This book touches all aspects of project management, shows you how to deal with the people, politics and risks of the job. This book is probably the best of the lower priced project management books. My only complaint is that this book has 3 inches of margins, but I still think this book would be a bargain at twice the cost."
5,Great picture and sound!!,"I purchased this tv for my first apartment and I have been more than happy with it. It has great picture quality (I especially like the flat screen--it cuts back on the glare), great sound and all the necessary toys like electronic bass boost and hyper-surround sound. The one touch multi-stage brightness is perfect for switching from a movie and tv without having to adjust all of the menu's. I swear by JVC for all my products and they have never let me down. Its a great value and has all the awesome performance I wanted. There is nothing missing from this tv."
4,Sufficient Rational?,"Schopenhauer's discussion of the organic nature of our humanity, is exciting, up-lifting, and scary. He swept away many of the cobwebs of human thought and meta-physical mysteries. To him, the brain, the limbic system,(although his concepts pre-dated modern brain theory), are really what's at the heart of human reason. He helped me to understand, the nature of truth, which is sufficient rational, based upon very human perception. Why is art beautiful? Why are entire people's irrational? Schopenhauer's work opens doors that modern psychology, in Freud and Jung stepped into.Heston's narration is very pleasant, and this treatment, although academic was very approachable for the dilettante.Gare Henderson"
2,Arthur Schopenhaure,Too much about him and not enough about his philosophy. He is a tough man to understand and I did not find enough to clarify his thinking for me.
3,NOT IMPRESSED JUST YET,I HAVE JUST GOTTEN (THE ENGLISH WOULD SAY GOT) MY FIRST COPY AND HAVE JUST PERUSED IT BUT FIRST IMPRESSION IS THAT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW BOOKS REVIEWED THAT INTEREST ME -- THE FORMAT IS VERY RESERVED AND RESTRAINED WHICH I GUESS IS A GOOD THING -- MOST OF THE BOOKS ARE AMERICAN WHICH IS ALSO FINE -- I WILL ADD TO THIS WHEN I'VE READ THIS COPY MORE THOROUGHLY...\HERB MARK -- WELLESLEY MA
2,What the....?,"I subscribed to this publication expecting to read reviews of various fiction/non-fiction books - what it turns out to be is a series of editorials, premised around virtually all non-fiction. All very high-brow and frankly, quite boring. The one item worthwhile is the classifieds. I think I'll ask to cancel my subscription and obtain a refund. I anticipated something that would help me in finding great books to read but after 4 issues, I haven't seen anything of interest."
1,Only works if you buy extra equipment,"This product is completely useless without hardwiring it to your car stereo. So if you buy one of these (which I don't recommend), just know that you willhave to buy the hardwiring kit as well. Which is something they don't tell you."
5,Loving the heart of God,"I experienced Anne MacCallum at a women's retreat a few years ago where she was doing the worship music portion. I like her so much that I purchased this CD and have enjoyed it ever since. She seems to write ""out of the box"" in some ways - the lyrics seem so original to me. But at the same time, she likes to use passages right from the Word of God. I love this!I also like the originality of the music. There is a Celtic quality about most of the songs which is very beautiful and gives a timeless appeal. Highly recommended."
4,"FINALLY, GREAT EXTRAS","The second DVD release of Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 landmark film THE TEN COMMANDMENTS -- Special Collector's Edition (Paramount) has all the extras you expected from the first. Charlton Heston hears God's voice and obeys bringing law and light and freedom to slaves. Elmer Bernstein's terrific score, great production design, still nifty effects, a six-part production documentary and a highly detailed commentary make this one for the library."
5,Excellent,Im very happy with the dvd version of this great epic. Great picture quality and sound. The voice of God is a bit subdued but all in all a very pleasurable viewing. While the purests are finding the tiny faults i will be enjoying this movie for many years.
5,Top Notch Classic,A must have classic. Movies of this caliber are so few and far between anymore. In my opionion you can't go wrong by adding this to your collection.
5,Great buy,We watched this movie around Easter and decided to get it. We are very happy with the versions that are included. A good movie to have on hand when you want to watch it.
3,It is a classic.,I bought this as a gift and was very happy to see that it has spanish subtitles.Great gift for Holy Week.
5,Classic and timeless,I have pleasant memories of watching this as a child and wanted to share it with some students. It is a timeless story that has never been better told.
5,Fantastic,"Box very beautiful, with a stunning effect of the red sea. all items contained in the Gift are fantastic. Excellent purchase. I recommend to everyone!"
5,Excellent Anniversary Package for any collector,"Package was safely dispatched to my address and contained all that was advertised. A collector's item now in my personal collection. Any similar for sale kindly let me know, thanks."
5,Ten Commandments !!,"Awesome movie that I have not seen in quite a while but I am looking forward to watching it !! I love this movie and it has a great cast !! For it's time when it was made , it was an incredible feat as well !!"
5,God Speaks!,Hello I purchased this movie for viewing on Easter. Every one enjoyed the movie. I thought it was an excellent movie. I am glad I have this movie in my collection.
5,When I think of Moses I think of him as Charlton Heston in this movie,"The Ten Commandments DVDThere have been many remakes of the Ten Commandments( at least three that I know about, but ,the one with Charlton Heston and Yul Brenner in it is as far as I'm concerned the best there is. When I think of Moses I think of him as Charlton Heston in this movie( I realize that this is not realistic, but I do). Highly recommended for fans of Charlton Hesston and Yul Brenner.Gunner June, 2008"
4,An enjoyable epic movie,"I'm not generally a big fan of epics, nor do I read a lot of religious works or stories, but I highly enjoyed this film. I believe it won for best cinematagrapy the year it was up for an Oscar in that category, and you can see why. Indeed, I was getting a little tired of the story about 2 and a half hours in, when the burning bush and the parting of the red sea woke me right up.Charlton Heston is maginificent, in all his youthful glory. Many of the femaole characters were overly dramatic (but what actresses weren't during this period) but great perfomances nonetheless. I can't really judge the movie for accuracy, having been unfamiliar with the story before, but it honestly didn't matter -- the movie was just fantastic (though you may want to watch it in 2 parts).Recommended."
2,Thumbs Up / Thumbs Down,"Reviewing Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 classic would be anticlimactic to say the least ~ I doubt anyone reading this hasn't already seen it (probably several times) and formed his own opinion. The 1923 original is another matter.The same attention to detail is given to sets and costumes, but not only is the whole substantially shorter than the 1956 masterpiece, only half of the movie tells the story of Moses. Part II is an early 20th century melodramatic morality tale based upon the damage done by violating the commandments given in Part I.There is a historical value in seeing what DeMille did his first time around, but the odds that you'll ever bother watching the first version a second time are slim."
3,maybe,the real question you have to ask your self is what was demille putting in his pipe when he decided on the cast (apart from yul brynner) its all nice staring at anne baxter and yvonne de carlo but heston walking around like lawrence of arabia among the tribes of ancient israel wasnt this prophet supposed to be jewish? dont get me wrong or anything i am all for religious representation but defining and giving demille acclaim for social and historical accuracy? you people must be watching the wrong movie. i am a big fan of the lavish fifties epics but lately this one has been bugging me because i never really concentrated on whats going on i was too busy with my jaw agape glued to the visuals. but all my praise to yul brynner rather a fierce eyed muscular monstrous god then an all dancing king of siam.
1,DONT BUY,PARAMOUNT IS SO CHEAP IT IS THE SAME DVD SET RELEASED LIKE THE OLD ONE JUST WITH A WEIRD 3RD DISC FOR THE BLACK AND WHITH VERSION
3,The Real Story is Better!!,"I was eager to look at the newly mastered version of the Ten Commandments. I admire the way it was done for the time, but I thought there were just too many intrigues and subterfuges and romantic tangles added. I like the real story better!The story doesn't really need enhancing. I understand that the producer was filling in the years we don't know about, but I think it was too far-fetched. It reminded me why I don't like Biblical epics!"
1,disappointed,This blu ray disc doesn't play. I have several blu ray discs and they all play fine in my player. This is the second time that I am having to return the ten commandments because it's a falty disc. I'm not purchasing anymore DVDs on amazon
2,Wrong region,DVD would not play. Wrong region would display. This information was not in the description of item. Returned for a full refund.
1,Ten commandments DVD,The DVD that was sent to me can only be played in machinesthat are in Europe and Japan?? Why send this product toa US address?
4,Very powerful,This is a good movie. fairly accurate according to the time given. Brings to life the story especially for kids.
5,Forget Cranky and Heston - this is DeMille's show!,"I am not sure if Cranky Reviewer is trying to be funny (which he/she isn't) or is just playing (or plain) dumb, but when C. Heston took on the role of Moses in 1956, I doubt he was looking four decades down the road to when he would front the evil NRA. Watching the film now, with Heston's politics so front and centre (and after the drubbing he took from Moore in Bowling For Columbine), the film does take on a highly ironic tone. But that should not stop anyone from enjoying this masterpiece of cinematic storytelling on a scale that only CB DeMille could deliver. Sure it's campy as can be in places, and the casting of stars like Edward G. Robinson in a Bible epic now seems quaintly offbeat, but you can't beat XComm. for sheer spectacle. I say watch it, and as Yul Brynner states, ""So shall it be written, so shall it be done!"""
4,"""Commandments"" impressive on Blu ray","The restoration work done for this release is to be commended. Colors are strong ,picture and soundtrack vibrant. While I feel ""King of Kings"" is the better blu raytransfer , ""Ten Commandment"" delivers. Now if MGM/Fox would restore ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" which in my opinion, is the worst Blu ray release ever."
5,wow,I have seen this movie when it first came out in vhs my lord what a differance bluray makes.it's beautiful
5,Hollywood Spectacular,"Latter-day reviewers have criticized the movie for its campy and overwrought style, but it does present one of the events of the Bible and history in a spectacular way."
1,Quality Control?,"DeMiles Ten Commandements is one of the greatest movies ever! However, Paramount's DVD is PATHETIC!When I recieved my copy from Amazon (I rate Amazon at 5 stars) the second disc had no movie on it. Amazon graciously replaced it. Unfortunately, the same problem occured.Wait a couple months on this one until Paramount gets their act together."
2,Poor packaging,"I love this movie, and you get a lot with this set! We got ours from a local store and it is a good thing we did as you will soon understand. When I opened it up the discs started to fall out. We started watching the blue-ray and found a big scratch on the disc. Thankfully, the store had another one, but being the cautious person I am, I had the store open the 2nd one before we headed home. The disks in this one were even worse. Everything was a mess. At this point the store brought up a 3rd set. We though third times the charm. Things were still broken in this one as well some of them scratched also. In the end between the three set we managed to piece togther a whole set and we were happy. So all in all check the discs when you get this."
1,Disappointed,I purchased a total of ( 3 ) of these movies. None of which would play anything.Not good.
3,An inaccurate Re-telling of a sacred text,"It would seem that De Mille re-read through the Exodus texts and decided to improve them via his film version. One big slip-up , perhaps the biggest, which no critic has noticed is the fact that only the first four of the Commandments are on the first Tablet and the other six are on the second Tablet, whereas they were divided up five & five, and written in pre-Sinaitic Hebrew !And as for the burning bush - the special effects were laughable. The Burt Lancaster version, if not as spectacular, is a much more sincere attempt to re-tell an ancient,yet up-to-date, true story."
1,The Ballad of Josie,"I brought this disc from you which is a copy of a copy that cuts off in the middle of the picture. In order for me to finish seeing it, I have to pause and fast-forward the section. I am very disappointed with this product. I wrote you to see if you could do something about it. I never heard from you. Very poor customer service."
4,Gift,This was given as a Christmas gift and the receipent was very pleased with the 2 disc special edition CD.
5,Cecile B. DeMille's last great cinematic epic,"The usual big budget film extravaganza produced and directed by Hollywood legend Cecile B. DeMille. Although quite a long film, the continuous action and the best cinematography money can buy keeps anyone in their seats. A very entertaining film despite the corny over-acting by Heston and company (you can get away with it most of the time in a biblical film). Hopefully, this film will be around for many future generations to enjoy."
5,Fabulous,"This movie is so amazing. I watched it with my grandparents when it was on VHS, and now that it is on digitally remastered DVD, the color and clarity of it is amazing. Such a great movie, one to definitely share with the kids."
4,Very good but goes on a little too long,The Ten Commandments is an excellent movie but it does tend to drag a little in places. Not as good as Ben Hur but better than most epics
5,A wonderful timeless film.,"i love to watch this movie. This movie never gets old to me. I just wish there were more movies like this. So more good movies are; the Love Sagas, The Book Of Ruth, and Facing the Giants."
2,The Ten Commandments,"Good state in general, but the low side presents any damages in the box. (Sunked and wrinkled box). The packing did not have interior protection."
5,"So let it be written, so let it be done!","Great in 1956...great in 2012....wonderful to have a quality DVD! Charlton Heston still rules as the quintessential ""Moses-the deliverer""' ever."
5,Watch this one,what a movie! It is the best holiday movie ever! there is nothing like it! Watch it if you havent seen it!
2,Ehhh,"I watched this one thinking it was going to be like the 1950's version and was surprised when it wasn't. The first part of the film is actually about Moses and the Ten Commandments. The second part of the film is a modern story dealing with the Ten Commandments.The first part of the film was the part that I really liked. It was pretty well done considering it was a silent film, and almost had to be over the top to get across its point to you.It was the second part that just dragged the whole movie down for me. I felt that part was just too long and spent time on scenes that didn't really need it. It lingered and lingered when it could have moved on to something else. It was well done, but just too long. And I say this as a person who appreciates the art of silent film. I know some of them were long, but this didn't keep my interest.If you're looking for the 1950's classic done in a silent version just watch the first part and skip the second. Or just come back to it at a later time."
4,Hollywood and the Bible,Hollywood nor a major director would ever attempt to do a movie like this today where they give credibility to the Bible and one of the prophets. There are hundreds of stories available in the Bible
3,A Classic,"Those who do not live by the law, shall die by the law! Charelton Heston stars in this classic film adaption of Bible hero Moses. God gives to Moses the 10 Commandments, hence the film's title. Moses also parted the Red Sea. Moses is most mentioned in the Bible's Exodus chapter."
2,Beware of this poor looking version of the film!,"A crummy copy of the sound version of the Ten Commandments was used for this DVD. If you want a beautiful, restored, crisp picture you will be greatly disappointed.On the other hand, if you only want a decent copy of the silent version of the film buy this."
1,Less than VHS video quality,"This DVD is less than VHS picture quality. Paramout have cheated us on this transfer to DVD. The picture quality is extremely poor, my laser disc copy is light years ahead.Do not waste your time, stay with your VHS until the studios can offer a better print. A film like this should really be of Blue Ray quality.Shame on you Paramount, Oh sorry, you do not have any shame."
3,Good intention...I guess,"I've seen this movie in pieces as a child and got the Dvd to view it as an adult. Not very impressed at all...Based on the movies made at the time...to me, this was very over rated. The special effects were very impressive...However, what was up with the script? Cecil de Mille's speech in the begining wasnt really necesary... The film's story Although sacred and true...wasnt well written and didnt translate without sounding not too beleiavable...maybe it was also the fact that he mixed Very Good Actors with bad ones... Key parts of the story of Moses weren't even included (Moses producing water from the rock, the reason why GOD was angry with him, etc...)Overall it was a ""pretty"" film, nice colors, costumes, music, and effects...Not much substance though... Ben-Hur was an INCREDIBLE film, Well written, acted, and directed! (without any major special effects)I sincerely and honestly beleive ""Prince of Egpyt"" moved me more than ""Ten Commandments""..."
2,No Silent 10 commandments,"I was lead to believe somewhere in the 480 customer reviews of this that included in this package was the silent version of the 10 commandments. This was the ONLY reason I bought this version. I have no interest in ""Chuck"" Heston's version of it. I'd return it but I've already opened it not believing the back cover which does not list the silent version on disk 2. It must be there! I though. But...... well you know the rest."
1,Old testament mumbo jumbo,"Except for Yul Brynner's performance, costumes and attire, the rest of the movie is Old Testament religious propaganda. The movie is a slap in the face of the ancient Egyptians (of the New kingdom in the 18th & 19th dynasties) face. Moses never led the Hebrews from Egypt. He drove them out with the rest of the Hyksos invaders in 1570 BC. I'm surprised that more people don't question the Old Testament Megalomania. Is there a way to vote zero stars?"
1,Makes Plan 9 From Outer Space Seem like a artistic Triumph,Thankfully a lot of people feel the same way I do about this film. It is offensively bad. So bad it makes Wood's Plan9 from Outer Space seem like a true cinematic classic. The special effects were raved about in the 50's but films that pre date this one such as Pal's war of the World and When World's Collide trumph this by centuries. Fans of the mythology should have been appalled and those that found it campy give it a universe of extra credit. First time I've seen the film. Heard about it for 50 years and admittedly the subject matter has kept me from really ever watching it. But I had no idea just how bad a film could be. Give me Attack of the Killer Tomatoes any time over this abomination. This should have ended the acting careers of everyone involved. Its like Criswell Predicts meets Kathryn Kuhlman being produced by the crew of MST3000. Only its not funny. My mouth is still stuck open in shock!!!!
5,Ten Commandments,The package come quicker than expected and in excellent condition! Very happy to have placed this order with you folks and plan on doing the same in the near future!!Thank you very much......Lou
5,prefecto estado,"el producto esta muy bueno,y sobre todo para los coleccionistas se les recomienda!!lastimas para latinoamericana no podemos hacer mas compras apartir de $100 es una verdadera lastima!! espero que solucione nuestro problemas."
4,A Grand Spectacle,"The movie begins with a few words from Cecil B. Demille. Here he describes what the movie will cover and also touches on the background for this movie. He mentions the books of Genesis and Exodus, but also mentions the writings of Philo and Josephus. This lets you know that there are additional parts here that are not taken straight from the Bible.The movie begins with quite a bit of rivalry between Charleton Heston and Yul Brenner. Both are good actors, and the rivalry adds emphasis to their confrontation when Moses asks Pharaoh to let his people go.Although some of the special effects aren't as captivating by today's standards, this is still a beautiful film. I would recommend seeing this movie."
5,"Is it a sin to ""lust"" after Ramsis?","I have always loved this movie. I never miss it for its annual showing on TV, and use the video throughout the rest of the year. Heston is sensational, and Brenner...well, I think my opening line says it all."
4,Absolutely a Classic,"I still enjoy watching this great film and even my kids like it. It tells the story of the Hebrews well without taking too many creative liberties. It helped paint a picture to my kids of how the plagues happened and the sacrifice Moses made to be associated with his people. There is lots of plot and drama.For those who don't enjoy a lot of the modern trash that is calling itself entertainment these days, get this movie. It will be a treat."
4,beyond expectations,TRYING TO REPLACE ALL MY VHS WITH DISCS AND WAS PLEASED TO SEE YOU HAD A GREAT PRICE ON ONE I WANTED. IT IS A TRASURE TO BE PASSED FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT. A TRUE STORY THAT NEVER GET OLD.
5,WOW!,"I finally bought and watched this classic epic on DVD just lastweek. After watching the first few minutes, I was awed by therestoration of this movie. I have watched the video version ofthis many times and the two don't even compare. It hardly looksalmost 50 years old. If you like this movie, and have a DVDplayer, buy this as soon as you can. ""So it shall be written,so it shall be done."""
4,Classic and one of a Kind.,"A very pleasant surprise. When I was young I saw this film which was released in 1956, I was impressed with the colors, the special effects such as the serpent fight, the parting of the Red Sea, the pillar of fire, etc. But, when I purchased this new release of March 2006, I was astonished by the colors, the scenery imaging, the special effects, and on my system with a Toshiba XA-2 HD-DVD player, a 42"" Samsung LCD TV, and a ONKYO SR604 A/V Receiver, this DVD was absolutely FANTASTIC, the details, the colors of Yul Brynner's costumes were brilliant, the parting of the Red Sea was breath taking.It is well worth the price, in fact, it is a steal at this price. Excellent work on the remake, please continue to do the great work on other classics. This will go into my reference library, filed under ""TREASURES"".Keep up the good work."
5,The Original in all its glory,"This is an amazing restoration. A real delight! It is as vivid as when I saw it in its original release.The extra features are an additional insight. But after viewing this,you will know how it looked in the theater. It even has the walk-on intro by Cecil B. DeMille, and all the opening and intermission and exit cards.(which you can by pass easily, but gives you original context) As the film was so long, an intermission was needed. And it gave one a breather from some of the intensity.It also has the original silent-film version from decades earlier, as an historical comparison.If you've only ever seen the film on television, you have never seen the film. This version is a must."
5,Nice Presentation,The 50th Anniversary Collection DVD set came in a very nice box and that made me very happy considering it was a gift. This collection also came with the 1923 black and white silent film version which my family and I enjoyed.
5,Outstanding Visual Experience,"I've always loved this movie, even when the networks chopped it up so horribly. This restoration goes beyond amazing. The clarity and color take one's breath away. The extras were quite entertaining, especially the added booklets. If you love this movie, this is the version to have."
5,Ten Commandments,"The very best follows Bible very close to what ocurred.Movies today are based on sex,no morals, and violence.What happen to truth in movies, this movie is based in true history."
5,The Big Ten,"Good movie. Granted there is a bit of ""artistic license"" in a few places, but still a classic. It always makes me want to buy some stone tablets and throw them down while saying ""Those who will not live by the Law, shall die by the Law!"""
5,the ten commandments,very informative and entertaining.kids will love it too.i have been looking for this movie for the past 5 years. thankyou amazon.I have found it here.
5,Grandiose Movie!,"This was a Grandiose and Great movie to see, especially around Easter. I remember when I was young seeing around each Easter The Ten Commandments and seeing it again is great to watch. The actors are good and the sript too. Great atmosphere, costumes but some of the specials effect look fake, like the fire and all that but it's an old movie so the specials effects were not so great at that time but it's still a good movie to watch. What I don't like is showing in this movie a punishing God, I don't like to think of him that way, I like to think of God as a forgiving one but it's a movie who is base on the old Bible and today some people like me beleive a forgiving God not the one for the old Bible, anyways it still a very good movie to watch and I especially like the Egyptien scenes, costumes and landscape, I always was fascinate by Egypte. Well if you like movie like that, you will like The Ten Commandments, it's one of the best movie by Cecil B. Demille's."
5,Exelente restauración,"Pros100% wide scrrenAudio en español latinoLa definición de la imagen es muy buena, casi un HD puroLos colores son muy vivosContrasEl nivel de volumen es bajo, en todos los audios, español pricipalmente."
3,"Overlong, but it could have been a lot worse.","The Ten Commandments isn't bad, but it would have been a lot better if they had shaved of about an hour. The story works fine, but I think that the writers tried to put in just a little too much. The Book Exodus comlete plus a sort of Prince of Egypte just doesn't fit into one movie. That said it managed to keep my attention reasonably well for the first hour en again for the last. The middle part had my fingers itching on the fast-forward button, but I managed to restrain myself. The effects that supposedly simulate an Egyptian building site are ridiculous and make one long for Quo Vadis, but the actors do their best to make it all work and the whole style of the movie is truly epic. Maybe it would have beeen better to make two separate movies instead of one. There is material enough and it wouldn't have become a bore halveway."
1,love story instead of Bible,I was very disappointed that so much of the movie consisted more of love stories than what was going on with the Bible story. This movie proved to be an embarassment to have my children watch it.
2,"Wonderful Then, Not Now","l saw this flick when it first came out, paid extra to get a seat, and was in awe of it. But that was a long time ago, and seeing it again gives me the shudders: stilted acting, pompous dialogue, and puerile special effects, e.g., the parting of the Red Sea is, by today's cinema standards, laughable. lt might be a good idea for someone like Steven Spielberg to re-make this flick and show how it can be properly done."
1,Still waiting,"I can't really review this product as I still have not received it. It was shipped Nov 21, one month ago. I have tried to contact you about this order but can't seem to get through. So, cancell the entire order and credit my account."
2,On The Ten Commandments,"If there was a God, he would have struck down Cecil B. DeMille before the director had a chance to start--let alone wrap--this film. In short, it's an aesthetically unpleasing, poorly scripted, and terribly acted bore. For Boomers, there may be some sentimental value, but, for everyone else, it's a terrible joke."
3,Way Too Expensive,Shame on Amazon for make such an old but great movie so so expensive before Easter. Shame on Amazon. This will probably drop to $1.99 or free Prime streaming after Easter. Shame on Amazon.
4,"Solid performances, marred by almost prissy high-mindedness.","""A song cycle"", says the liner notes. Sonically and thematically the album does have a running theme throughout. Batalla's voice is versatile enough, smoky and sensual, a rich instrument, and her songwriting and arrangement draw from Latin music and classical influences to make for an exotic mix.However, I do find the album somewhat perched on a mountain looking down on its listeners. Lacking in dynamic and hooks, Mestiza sounds like it wants to be in a museum instead of in a stereo. Ditto for the lyrical themes and arrangements, complicated entities that can be bewildering, oftimes frustrating. Without the warmth of a Babacar (with lead singer Caroline Crawley's warm voice adding down-to-earth appeal to dazzling world-music, Celtic and folk arrangements) or the impeccable songwriting hooks of Sarah Slean, Perla Batalla is relegated to be a high-art experience, one that I can appreciate but not relate or respond to emotionally."
5,This music is to be experienced!,"This album is the first time I've heard of Perla Batalla. I can only say that I feel deprived. for me Perla's voice is a spiritual experience. I have been a musician all my life. My musical experiences are extremely varied and still I have never heard such an extraordinary combination of God given talent and passion in one place. This group is a gift to us all who are in need of a truly spiritual experience in music. And make no mistake, this music IS to be experienced. The casual listener will never fully comprehend the potential impact of this music on the soul."
5,Both the lyrics and the music are magical and moving.,"This is an incredible work that will appeal to a wide audience. Perla Batalla's voice is simply beautiful and has a range that we don't often hear these days. When that is combined with very meaningful words and music that is from real instruments and composed by very creative and talented humans (not machines), the result is truly a magical experience."
3,It's O.K.,"I like this CD. I am not impassioned about it. It's pretty and relaxing to listen to, but not stellar in the content of its talent or music. It is certainly neither satanic or trance inducing. A couple of the songs are not to be missed..I love 'Remnant' and Iberia - the symbolism and story telling is great."
1,Asleep in Seattle,I ordered this with moderate expectations. I played the CD in my car driving home from work and almost fell asleep in rush hour traffic. Perla please pick up the pace and diversify your sound tracks. Monotone Mestiza? I'll give the CD to my Latte hyped coworkers.
1,Disappointing!,I was impressed by this singer's gorgeous voice but I found most of the lyrics and melodies without much substance. I was expecting a more upbeat Latin sound but it was more adult contemporary than I care for. I think I'll send it to my parents!
1,Boring Content Lame Music,"I think that the title of this review sums up the CD. It was just boring and lame. I think that it was a feeble atempt for Ms. Batalla to produce a new CD that would get her acclaim. Poor music, terrible content, and a boring voice will not give her a chance to suceede in the music world."
1,Lovely voice does not compensate for boring content,"This album is boring, sappy and trite. I listened to it twice, just to be sure. It didn't get any better the second time around."
3,A Big Mac of a statistics read,"I rewrote the original review (but left the comments thread, dealing with Mr. Ratner's past cavalier approach to intellectual property) to point to availability of the book's second edition, unusually published under a different title. As Russian composer Shostakovich said of a young musician he didn't like: ""It's better he plays music than drinks vodka"". Reading the book will do you no harm, just be aware that this is a rather lazy book by, shall we say, a non-authority. I am not aware of a statistics book focusing specifically on marketing - this one isn't either, I recall - but why not get a decent, credible, well-written ""general-purpose"" statistics book instead."
3,Good,"I could not give high marks because even after 1st use and rinsing very well, coffee still stains it! That's coffee for you!"
1,Not as advertised,The filter that I ordered was specifically for the Hamilton Beech high end coffee maker that I owned. It did not fit the coffee maker when it arrivved. I bought a new coffee maker and have the filter out in my garage...maybe I can filter paint with it or something.
3,"Great item, not the right part for me though...","I bought this item thinking it would fit my coffee maker but it did not, and I was able to get a refund without issue.It arrived on time, new in package."
2,Hamilton Beach Permanent Gold Tone Filter,This filter is way too small. The coffee grounds overflow and get into the coffee maker. Wouldn't recommend this product.
2,Ehhh!,"Probably does well in other coffee makers but not so well in the Hamilton Beach Ensemble. Brewed my very first cups of coffee woth the gold filter, the coffee came out a very light brown,I opened the top of the coffee maker and noticed not all off the coffee gorund had even been saturated. So i ran the same pot thru a second time and the coffee came out a little darker. Next I used a paper filter, the coffee came out the color it was supposed to be and all of the coffee ground had been saturated. There was a huge diffeence between the gold/paper filter. Although I would have rather used the gold filter since it allows alot of the coffe oils to remain in the coffee, I get such a better brew with the paper filter...less clean up too!"
3,Doesn't fit,"This does not really fit the Hamilton Beach Stay or Go coffee pot, but it can be used with it. It does not drop fully into place. Not sure why since it was the one recommended to fit by Amazon. Otherwise it works fine and is surely easier than paper filters."
2,Not worth it.,I'm afraid the coffee tasted terrible using this. I probably would you a paper towel instead of this if we run out of filters. I came quickly and looked good. Wish the coffee tasted better.
5,GOOD,THIS PRODUCT WORKS AS SAID.I DO LIKE IT BETTER THAN OTHER FILTERS.THEY SHIPPED IT FAST.THE PRICE WAS CHEAPER THAN OTHER PLACES.
3,good,"it is as advertised, works well nothing super duper but a good solid product. I would recommend to anyone who is tired of paper filters"
2,Bummer,"We used paper filters for a week, until we got this in the mail. Our coffee was brewing just fine. When we used this, the coffee became very weak. After a few days of coffee-flavored dishwater, we went back to the paper filters, and coffee was back to normal again."
2,I'm not sure about this,"The idea is good - saving on coffee filters, but coffee grounds still get through and into the coffee. I don't like sludge in my coffee. Using a filter with it defeats the purpose, so I really don't use it anymore. Save your money on this item and put it towards paper filters."
1,Not worth the money,The filter lets fine coffee grinds through. A simple paper filter will give you a grind free cup of joe.
4,No need for paper filters,Eliminates use of messy paper filters and speeds up coffee brewing process. saves on cost of paper filters with reusable and easy to clean filter.
2,good - but,"I found that since the bottom of this filter is also the gold mesh, the coffee flows thru the filter too quickly - which in turn causes you to use more coffee than you might normally do. I like a bolder dark roast Sumatra and this filter - even with the bold setting on the Hamilton Beach Ensemble coffee maker - didn't allow the full flavor of the coffee to come thru. I had another similar filter whose bottom was a solid plastic. This one fit and worked better - IMHO.However, it is hard to beat the $1 price of this filter."
3,TOO MUCH FOR SHIPPING,Because this was a gift and I don't know how to rate it. I bought it along with the Hamilton Beach coffee maker after seeing it for .98. I thought it was a joint offer. It was nice to get free shipping for the coffee maker but not to pay $5.77 for a .98 cent product.
3,Doesn't fit well in the 10-cup BrewStation (47380),"I bought the filter for my 10-cup Hamilton Beach BrewStation (model: 47380). The filter itself was not as nice a product as I had expected - the mesh section is very thin and feels like a few cleaning might stretch or rip it. However, for the price I was not surprised by the quality of the product. The filter is also not the right size for the BrewStation I have - it is too small and doesn't fit well in the coffee maker. Unfortunately, I can't find another permanent filter option specifically for the Hamilton Beach."
4,Some surgery may be required!,"I have used a gold-tone filter for years so purchase for one to go with my new Brewstation Plus (Model 47686) was a ""no brainer."" Unfortunately, it was too tall to allow the lid on the brewstation to close properly. Yes, it's the Brewstation PLUS - the one that this filter is supposedly made to fit.Rather than go through the ""return this one and search for one that fits"" hassle, I shaved the top of the filter down (exacto blade and a steady hand) until the coffeemaker top would close properly. It fits slightly loosely in the coffeemaker but that doesn't seem to be a problem (I was concerned that water might spill over the top during brewing and carry grounds out of the basket and into the coffee - it doesn't).The filter gets five stars for performance but loses one since it didn't fit the way it was supposed to.Bottom line: After the ""modification"" described, this coffeemaker-filter combination of filter makes great coffee."
1,Why doesn't it fit as it should?!?,"We just bought a 47665 Brewstation Plus, and contrary to another revier's comments, this filter is too small. We also have an older/regular brewstation (47224), and the fit mismatch was even worse on that model. So I don't really know which Hamilton Beach coffeemaker this thing is designed to fit, but it certainly isn't the 47665 or 47224. We will be returning this item."
2,don't buy this product,"Don't buy this product, because is not bigger then other filters that are sold at grocery stores. I first bougth one from a grocery store and I thought it was too small to fit right in the hamilton beach brewstation so I went and bot this product thinking it would fit better to my amazement it did not it was no biger then the filter I bought at the grocery store and I pay only 3.95 for the filter it was black and decker filter. I promise you will be mad when you get it cause you would think it would be custom made for the actual brewstation but is not.Oh, and the water filter has to be change every one to three months don't bother buying it just used your personal water filter for the water. The only nice thing about the coffee filter is that it's color is golden. that's it. Don't buy it."
5,Does its job,"Fit my new Hamilton Beach coffee pot just right, and was easy to clean last night in-between pots of coffee. I love having a reusable filter instead of throwing them away with each pot!"
1,Size does matter!!,"Basket is to small for the coffee maker so it spills over and put grounds into the coffee. Would not buy again, this one is going to the Salvation Army."
3,OEM doesn't guarantee perfect,"I hate using a paper filter every time I make coffee, so this item is a necessity to go with my Brewmaster.Picked up a $5.00 generic basket and it was too tall-- wouldn't fit, so I bought this one made by Hamilton-Beach, specifically for their coffee maker.It fits, but not well. It's a couple of mm too high, so the lid doesn't sit properly on the carafe and it's tricky to get in and out of the base.I expect things engineered in the 21st century to allow a little clearance."
5,hamilton beach coffee maker,i find the product a new and inovative way to brew coffee. it exceeded my expectations
1,Does not fit Brewstation Deluxe,"Despite indications on the Hamilton Beach web site that this filter would work as a replacement, this model is too small. A call to Hamilton Beach resulted in us being informed that there is no filter to fit the Brewstation Deluxe."
3,Its ok,"It appears a little small for the actual coffe maker but I am able to make 12 cups with no problems. It prevents setiment in the coffee and helps leave a clean taste. Overall it does the job, just a little small for the machine in my opinion."
5,Smell the Aroma,I am glad to find this basket for use in our church rather than using the paper filters each week
3,Okay,It was okay because it is a filter. I don't compare similar products. I guess it does meet my expectations.
1,TOO SHALOW,It will not hold my normal amount of coffee without over flowing because it is too shallow. This works fine if you like weaker coffee. Normal paper filters this shape are twice the height.
5,The Hamilton Beach 80675 filter does fit,"the Hamilton Beach Ensemble 12-cup coffeemaker, which is model 43254 . It's not completely tight but it fits reasonably snugly in the holder and works just fine."
2,2 BIG.,"I bought this filter because it is specifically made for the Hamilton Beach Brew Station Deluxe. It is too big and as a result, it effects how the coffee is made by allowing steam to escape and less coffee. Other then that it works I just feel that if you buy the exact filter for the exact product it should fit."
2,"Great head light, bad tail light.","The headlight is super bright, and the blink feature is great for the daytime. Installs easily, but you might need to use pliers to make it tight enough to not move. The tail-light is almost useless though. Can hardly see it on a bright, sunny day. It's so small, that during the night drivers will misjudge the distance to you. Has a VERY loose braket on a topeak bike rack. Not a great item for bad city steets."
3,bike lights by topike,the head light is brit but the battrey does not last long but the tail light is grat and it is vrry brit and the bartty does last on it thats about all i can say about it orthe then it is a good price and they are brit and this tail light is hard to find any where elece and if u do find it elece where it will cost u alot more so get it here !
2,Lost in transfer,"I recently purchased a copy of this DVD because I knew the story and hoped to enjoy the movie. Unfortunately the transfer of the print from video was so poor, it was almost imposible to watch. The soundtrack and the film were out of sinc and large chunks of the film were out of focus.A real shame because the story itself looked excellent."
2,"It looks good but...,","THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SAME CHAIR IN BLUEI was very taken by this chair in Babies R Us when we registered. It looked cool (or, as cool as a baby rocking chair can look) and after a long day of shopping was quite comfortable.However, after getting it home the euphoria lasted about two days.First, it was the squeaking. Oh, for the love of all things holy, please stop the SQUEAKING!!! At first I tried to readjust the chair. Then it was the WD-40. Then more WD-40. Then I gave up.Secondly, the pad for the chair had a 2 to 3 inch gap on one side.Overall, for the money, this chair should be avoided."
4,This a great chair,"I had wanted something for my daughters room to sit in and feed her and read books to her in. I didn't find anything in my town that I liked or wasn't well over 500 to 600 dollars. I found a few other ones online and were just as high or lower but they wanted to charge 200 to 300 on shipping alone!! I found this, when it got here I couldn't have been any happier! It's a really comfy chair and looks great in my daughters room. Only one small complaint is that is a little low to the ground, so it can be a little hard to get out of. But sitting is very nice and the baby and I fit well into it. I'd buy this chair again in a heartbeat. For the price of the chair and shipping it's a must have for any little girls room!"
1,NIGHTMARE!!,"THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME DEALING WITH AMAZON AND IT HAS BEEN A DIASTER! I ORDERED AN OTTOMAN AND SWIVEL ROCKER IN PINK GINGHAM FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER - SHE'S EXPECTING IN OCTOBER. THE TWO PIECES WERE SHIPPED FROM TWO DIFFERENT SOURCES AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED - THE PINK GINGHAM ON THE CHAIR DIDN'T MATCH THE PINK GINGHAM ON THE OTTOMAN. THERE WAS NO WAY TO CONTACT AMAZON SO I WENT TO BABIESRUS - HAD TO TAKE THE OTTOMAN (THE CHAIR WAS TOO HEAVY) TO A BASIESRUS STORE, BUY IT AGAIN, CANCEL THIS AND THAT AND AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF GOING BACK AND FORTH (I HAD THE TWO PIECES SHIPPED TO MY DAUGHTER IN CT AND SHE HAD TO DO ALL THE RUNNING AROUND IN HARTFORD!)THE RIGHT COLORS WERE FOUND. NIGHTMARE! I REALLY FEEL I DESERVE TO AT LEAST HAVE A REFUND ON THE SHIPPING CHARGES FOR ALL THE PROBLEMS WE HAD. I THINK I WILL THINK TWICE OR EVEN THRICE BEFORE I PURCHASE ON AMAZON AGAIN!!"
1,Terrible Rocker,"We purchased this rocker when my child was born six months ago. It lasted about five months, and then it completely broke! The mechanism at the bottom is not at all sturdy, and one of the metal rods has severed in the middle. As a result, when you sit in the chair it makes horrific noises (that wake up the baby). The chair no longer rocks but moves at odd angles in all directions. We have had a terrible time with this chair and we DO NOT recommend it."
5,like shawn marion? great shirt,Looks great and washes well. I am pleased with how well this shirt is holding up and it gets worn and laundered frequently.
2,"Not-so elegant linens, after all.","After reading about this book in a home magazine, I looked forward to purchasing it (ordered it from Amazon.com, of course). Unfortunately, the ""elegant"" linens in Mrs. Irvine's book ranged from a tea cozy to a pin cushion to outdoor seat covers. Although the photographs were lovely--I especially admired the collection of antique Christening gowns--and her prose was light and cheerful, I did not learn anything about making linens that I would consider elegant or even potential heirlooms."
4,Lovely display of linens for the home.,"Chippy Irvine is an elegant lady with a fine taste in fashion for the home. An interior designer and editor for Design Times magazine, this author offers a beautiful collection of linens for every use in the home. She shows the reader how to care for, store, and mend every type of luxurious linen. This book is also a wonderful resource for 26 projects to make for the home. Ms. Irvin offers her assistance for making napkins, tablecloths, dainty pincushions, placemats, napkin rings, table runners, cocktail napkins, tassels, aprons, shoe holders, sink curtains, bathrobes, cushions, a gardening apron, and more. This is a wonderful resource for the care and construction of linens."
4,"A great comedy, if lacking DVD features","This is a great comedy. You won't find a second disk full of director's comments or actor's remarks, or cut scenes...but you will have a very funny movie to watch.Steve Martin is at his best, portraying a New York mobster in the witness protection program. He has been relocated to friendly, sunny southern California--""hell"" as he puts it.He's miserable until he finds a cadre of similar transplants and gets back to his gangster ways. Along the way he charms a DA, a police woman and teaches his FBI watcher that there is more to life than a boring job.This is one of the better Steve Martin comedies, ranking up there with _Father of the Bride_ and _Planes, Trains, and Automobiles_."
4,Good Harmless Fun,"This movie is a very entertaining film. I never knew Rick Moranis and Steve Martin could dance Merengue. It is lighthearted, exceeds reality of the witness protection program when Martin (Antonelli) opens up a baseball park for the kids at the end of the movie - with his real name(not alias) on the stadium. But who cares. The humor is lighthearted, the plot is mushy, silly humor with two guys getting two girls in the end. The FBI agent gets the county prosecutor and the mob squealer gets the female cop. So what - it still rates good, harmless movie fun when you consider all the violence, sex and distorted realities in so many other movies out there today."
1,Do NOT Waste Your Time,"A woman in power who's got a major chip on her shoulder. A female law enforcer who's so blinded by love she gives her GUN to a criminal on trial and later has his baby while he's married to TWO other women. the same mafia goon is elected MAN OF THE YEAR. give me a break and please don't insult my intelligence! the thought that crossed my mind most frequently during the movie was: ""did they expect me to laugh at that?"" don't waste your time or your money."
2,A lesser Steve Martin,"The acting is fine and the direction competent. But the script is extremely weak. Oh, Nora, you failed us again. There are very, very few laughs."
1,lame,"Slow, ended up sleeping the last half. Very dated, not how I remembered Steve Martin.was cool to stream from an kindle fire"
5,Funniest movie ever,"This is my favorite comedy. Steve Martin and Rick Moranis are so funny in this movie and Joan Cusack absolutely puts it over the top. When I feel low and need a lift, all I have to do is start watching this movie to brighten my spirits. It is hilarious!"
2,"CLASSIC FUNNY MOVIE, DVD VERSION NOT WORTH THE EXTRA DOLLARS","Okay, so I sinned and purchased a film that isn't anamorphic, heck this DVD isn't even widescreen! But it didn't cost much more than the VHS tape. Unfortunately there aren't any extras on the disc, behold why so inexpensive, and the picture and sound quality make me wonder if I would have been just as well off purchasing the VHS version. The only problem would be that I don't pop in my VHS movies any more. This movie is very funny. Steve Martin plays a great italian mobster and Rick Morranis plays the perfect boring federal agent. If you don't find yourself quoting this movie then either you're too serious, or I'm too easily amused. The movie is a 4 star movie, if only this movie could get a quality DVD transfer some day."
5,"If you like Steve Martin, check this out","Steve Martin MAKES this movie, he's hilarious and in a role I've never seen him in before!"
5,(Wit)ness protection plan,"With the emphasis on humor, (what do you expect from Steve Martin and Rick Moranis). This is a movie about how twisted the FBI can get when trying to protect witnesses in a major crime.When Steve Martin is relocated to a small town he brings his big city crimes with him, from borrowing cars to repricing groceries. The local prosecutor locks horns with Martin Short and tries to have Steve Locked up.The plot was very well written and the characters, very believable.If you like Steve Martins type of humor then you will like this movie."
4,Funny!,I love this movie. Can't say that enough. Rick Moranis as a federal agent is still and lovable. Steve Martin as a fast talking ganster will make your side hurt from laughing. What makes this movie great though is that the whole family can see it. The price makes it a must have for the home collection.
2,"Great music, bad package","First off, the music contained in this package is in every way worthy of five stars and the sound quality is excellent. I have two copies of this on vinyl and jumped on the CD version. The original 9 track LP is actually a short story put to music and the tracks are chapters. The 11 track CD released by Master Classics Records not only put the tracks in the wrong order, they added silence between tracks that originally ran together and in one case, edited a very short part of one track to the beginning of another track. I spent four hours, on my computer, editing, copying and pasting the tracks to create a CD-R version that matched the worn out vinyl. If you are interested in learning more about this collection of music you can read the original liner notes which is guide through the story at, [Ark-2(dot)co(dot)uk] I strongly recommend getting your hands on a copy of this music and reading the LP liner notes."
4,A Great Album In It's Own Right,"Flaming Youth's only album is great its own right. Too bad they didn't record more. We know about Phil Collins but whatever happened to Brian Chatton, Ronnie Caryl and Gordon Smith?All songs are unique and don't sound dated. Rockers like 'Changes', 'In the Light of Love' and 'Pulsar' are instantly memorable. 'From Now On' wouldn't sound out of place at church ceremony."
2,solo para super fanaticos,"flaming youth es solamente reconocido en la historia por una sola cosa,fue el primer grupo en que estuvo phill collins.su unica produccion es esta ark2 de 1969 finalmente disponible en cd.que les puedo decir:solo para fanaticos obsesionados con tener todo lo que tenga que ver con genesis en su coleccion,si ese no eres tu no compres este cd.la musica esta estructurada en formatos largos pero simples armonicamente .phill toca la bateria y tambien canta.solo es bueno tenerlo como documento historico ya que es el debut de collins,pero si quieren escuchar lo real y valioso de verdad van a tener que buscar en el segundo disco en que aparecio collins en toda su carrera ;nursery crime de genesis."
3,great golf book,love the detail of the rules for golf. beginner on a sanctioned league and this really helped me out.
4,Golf Etiquette is necessary in the new age of Golf,The book is good and is helping me teach my Grand Nephiews and Grand Nieces the etiquette of golf. I purchased each of them a Guide and they are reading it. They range in age from 9 to 15 years old.I have seen a marked improvement in thier demeanor on the course during rounds of golf.This is a very good book to give as presents for the fledgling golfer.
2,"If you want to damage the topcase, go for it","I got this after I ruined my laptop keyboard by spraying contact cleaner to remove some coke poured on it (DO NOT TRY THAT!).This keyboard looks sturdy and very well built, with the right wiring and all.But it was the WRONG choice: once you disassemble the Macbook, after around a dozen screws, and take apart the top case, you eventually have to break the small plastic rivets (a lot of them) that hold the keyboard attach to the top case. There are no screws, clips or anything like that that you can put back, just plastic rivets welded to the top case that will have to be broken in order to remove the old keyboard and put the new one. If you don't mind creating somehow your own plastic rivets (melting plastic or attaching it with scotch tape) after breaking the originals, then you are good to go. I returned mine without major problems."
2,Bad Review's More for Apple than this Keyboard,"These keyboards are not meant to be replaced by the end user. Apple, in their proprietary technology-loving wonderfullness, has made what should be a very easy in-and-out replace into a freaking nightmare with their goofy one-time-use snaps that hold everything in place. You'll never really be able to get your keyboard snap flushly into place the way the original did. You basically have to destroy large swaths of connectors to get the old keyboard out and the new one in. It's a breeze to get it to work, though, once you've got the machine reassembled and the top c-clamped down )as you'll never again have a regularly-functioning keyboard top that will hold itself in place).Avoid. Spend the extra cash and just buy the whole keyboard top/trackpad assembly. And then never buy another computer you didn't build yourself."
1,beware,This keyboard does NOT include the top panel. It's extremely difficult to replace it this way. I bought one and its useless to me.
4,"Comprehensive US History, used",Used text book was in as good or better shape as book store. Timely shipping.
3,Only for NASA Collectors or Climate Researchers,"As the title of this NASA produced document (NASA Special Publication, NASA SP-398) suggests, this book describes the 1976 standard atmosphere above 86-km altitude. Specifically, this book describes the development of an atmospheric model for altitudes above 86 km. In addition, temperature and composition profiles of the atmosphere are presented as well.For this general reader of books about NASA and what it is does, this book will be of no value. This book is only geared to those individuals involved in atmospheric science or space travel. The only others who maybe interested in this book are collectors of NASA produced books.It is important to note that this book has been out of print for approximately years, and it is difficult to find a used copy."
4,A lot of fun...at least for us,"This is a really an entertaining read, which deals more with the non-musical events of Haggard's life than the musical. This is absolutely fine, given the fact that his life seems to have had a hell of a lot of drama in it.Haggard's voice feels as if it comes through very clearly here, which is certainly a credit to Peggy Russell. Throughout, I was reminded of another book I really enjoyed: Levon Helm's memoir of his life and work with The Band, ""This Wheel's on Fire.""Haggard, as he readily admits, isn't always an easy person to like in this book. Yet, his apparent honesty in this story is far more endearing than any glossed-over portrait would have been.I certainly came away from the book with more respect for him and his music than I had going into it. My only complaint is that they didn't talk enough about his musical life, though I've already been inspired to learn more about that!"
5,True Texas Music,"Just another great album by one of the finest singer song writters in Texas. If you like the Texas/Americana music scene you'll love Houston's music! It's like what Ray Wylie Hubbard said about Houston: ""he's throwed the gauntlet down for all the other singer/song writters to follow."" A great album, with lots of well written songs and a must for Texas music fans. All of Houston's albums are fantastic and this one is no exception."
1,Waste of Money,I bought this pump recently. Don't waste your money. The valve fitting fits poorly around the valve. The pump leaks constantly when attached. It takes me 200 pumps to raise the air in our SUV by 4 psi. The rubber foot pedal cover slipped off the pedal within 30 seconds of use.
4,Byrnes another treasure,"It's fun, informative and useful. I have several Byrne books and videos and I review them once in a while. I hesitated buying this in fear it was merely a revamping of old material. I found it used...and bought it anyway; I was so wrong, it's totally new and fresh and a great addition to my library. Byrne comes thru once again and shows why he's been inducted into the BCA hall of Fame."
4,4 and a half stars,"Imagine my surprise when I bought this album. Cex is actually a dope MC! This kid has been getting mad press...but with this being out on Tigerbeat6 I was expecting something more like Kid 606 or Electric Company, which is not exactly what I'm into. I have not heard any of Cex's other material...but this album is dope. Nice break beats, with out the annoying glitch cut-up, and the lyrics are playful, but always on point. All I can say is I'm really impressed by this guy and can't believe he is only 20 years old."
2,Caveat Emptor,"As a lecturer in Mobile Telecommunications I was concerned that this book is light on detail in some places, and authoritatively wrong in others. For example, the author makes basic errors in his description of the GSM logical architecture (particularly with respect to the network databases) and he does not describe the current HR and EFR GSM voice codecs; the section on IS-95 CDMA does not describe soft handoff or cell identification in detail and has not been updated to describe IS-95A. His derivation of Erlang B is also missing a number of key steps. These factors make this textbook unrecommendable for my students. A THOROUGH revision is in order for the next edition."
2,Pretty light,"If I had not seen the Gorden Stuber book I would have given this book only 1 star. However in comparison, it does deserve at least 2.This book has all the stuff you would want in a wireless text book. It covers fading, Rayleigh, Rician, GSM, AMPS etc. My major complaint with the book is THERE ARE NO EXAMPLES. Per chapter there are probably 3 or 4 examples, but none of them are really challenging.For instance in the fading chapter, the examples are on coherence time only. How about a couple examples that actually use the fading PDF's/CDF's. We spend so much time ""discussing"" the distributions, maybe it is time we actually use the distributions?Compared to ""Principles of Mobile Communication"" the book is marginally better. For one it is not as heavy on the math, and it does a better job explaining pretty well everything.However.. I feel I learned far more from Shankar's wireless book in undergrad."
2,Unorganized textbook,"this book is not good for the beginner in wireless communication. I have to use this textbook, because it's the requirement form my instructor.the author didn't organize this book as well as he should. All equations are not well explained...Sometime the students need to guess where this variable stands for or what parameter's meaning is. He wrote like the literature or drama.....no space for equation's explanation...all of them are in the same paragrah.i really don't recommend this textbook and i still don't understand why my instructor uses this text"
4,Good for getting an overview and explaining principles,"I've used this book through a course in radio communications at my university.I think the book is good for exactly what the title suggests - giving a basic insight to many principles and practice in the field.It describes and derives some formulas etc., but it does not give detailed knowledge in the mathematics, physics, electronics or propagation.The book is very much text-based, explaining principles instead of being very mathematically built.It works fine for instance when explaining the ground reflection two-ray model, but not so good when explaining the GSM codec.It is a fine supplement to a carefully selected collection of books on radio/microwave communication, or for getting an overviewof principles and techniques employed in different present technologies."
3,Trying to stay awake,This is very dry reading that overloads you with acronyms...I am hoping that I can get into this as I need a refresher before I start working on LTE.
3,Little bit disappoint,"This has many typos, which can be frustrating in following the context. And I found out that the typos are different to other 2nd editions. Little bit disappointing."
2,"Outdated, not helpful","I purchased this book because it had lots of maps and suggested itineraries. With only a short stay in Rome planned, it seemed like an excellent guide. However, we found the book very unhelpful. First, it is already outdated. I believe it is from 2009. Some things were closed, prices were off, and some tips were inaccurate. For example, it suggests you leave the sistine chapel through the door on the right to go straight to St. Peters, however that entryway is now only accessible to tour groups. The other main complaint is that the book is extremely repetitive rather than going into depth. There are so many itineraries and some are practically the same (ex: Baroque walk and Piazza Navona walk are practically the same) A few more sentences on each site would have been a much more useful way to stretch out the book - the descriptions were way too abbreviated."
5,Great book that helped us,This book helped us greatly. We got around Rome fine for our first time. We liked this one better than the top 10 book.
5,Perfect Take Along Book,The book was in excellent condition.This is a perfect book to take on your journey.Not bulky but packed with all the necessary details you need.Condensed fold out layout of the city and major attractions.Extensive more detailed folfing map tucked in its own holderin the back. Recieved my order in record time perfect transaction.
5,Great Info and a Map,"I found the Map very valuable and the text great for research for the next days adventures.There is a lot in the book, so don't be overwhelmed. I found it fairly easy to navigate and theMap was a great companion that I used each day I was in the area"
4,Rome,Frommer's Rome was up to date - the map was great and it fits nicely into a purse or pocket.Descriptions of attractions very helpful.
2,so so guide,"Just ok as an ""encyclopedia of facts"" but not very accurate and not useful for an actual tour of the city. Feels like it is made by someone reading an encyclopedia. Maps not very useful and hard to read."
1,Shame on you amazon for selling the hate!,"I'm researching hate groups, and I was extremely disappointed to find out that amazon is selling CDs from the original neo-Nazi music group! Is this the sort of philosophy you support amazon or does money override everything?"
3,man's watch?,I've seen this watch or one just like at a fossil store. It was featured as a man's watch....something to keep in mind if buying it as a woman's watch bc it may be bulky on her wrist.
1,didn't receive,i ordered this product for Xmas and have yet to receive an issue. Amazon sold but magazine did not deliver.
5,Great!,"On moving to the Atlanta area we found this magazine invaluable for restaurants, events, the area's who's-who, happenings, AND even picking a physician."
4,"Great ""Atlanta"" magazine for those wanting to be in the know!!","I have been a fan for years and finally subscribed. Got a great deal on Amazon, so how could I say ""no"".Great magazine for those who want to know whats going on and will be going on in Atlanta, a great Southern City!!"
2,Disappointing Unless You're a Complete Newbie,"The author provides pretty basic information in a rather general fashion (more breadth than depth.) The chapters are short and almost all of her examples come from her own books. There's a disk with electronic versions of the exercises, but they were saved in a funny format. Luckily, I knew to change them to text files so that I could open them up at least. If you're just starting out, then this might be a helpful guide. Your money is probably better spent joining RWA or buying Julie Beard's book (which I hear is good but have not yet purchased.)"
5,Love is in the air....,"If you are struggling to write that romance that is bubbling inside of you, this book can give you some guidelines, solidify paths for you to explore and perhaps give you an idea of why your book isn't gelling. This is a well organized, succinct reference that not only will the aspiring romance writer find helpful, but also the fiction writer. The book also touches upon publishing the book as well as marketing and selling."
4,Good,"This book is a no-nonsense ""get down to it"" read. I have learned more about writing romances than I ever thought possible from one book! Well done."
5,Working Fine After Five Years,"After five years of near daily use, the TV is working just fine. Five stars is based on reliability and quality of sound and video for price paid."
4,iTunes?,Probably should've just bought the individual songs I wanted off iTunes instead of paying for 3 cds for 5 songs...
5,Awesome Collection,I recently became a fan of Queen and this collection has some great songs. I was looking at Vol. I and II separately and I think this was a better deal. I absolutely love these cds! The booklet is very nice. Overall this is a sweet collection of Queen and it's at great price.
1,Queen greatest hits 3 cd,This is probably the worst 3 CS collection I have ever bought!!! The first one is all their recognized hits. The last 2 are absolutely ridiculous. I would have been better off with just the 1 CDS. Don't puchase!!!! BIG RIPOFF!!!
4,"Greatest Hits I, II & III - The Platinum Collection (3CD)","The shipment was really fast and the product was really good but the only thing that I can point was that the box letters had some problem whit the printing and black ink around them, like there was too much ink and had to spread over the paper....but not a big problem and yet a great product."
2,Where Is Disk 1 ??,"My set was delivered yesterday. I opened it up this morning only to find that Disk 1 is missing, hence the 2 star rating. My set was wrapped in soft plastic unlike most new CD's which come wrapped in the stiffer clear plastic you have to cut open. The plastic wrapper also had a sticker on it labeled ""as seen on TV"". Go figure. I'm sure Amazon will make this right via exchange, but it's a hassle."
1,Freddy is rolling in his grave,"I have Greatest Hits I & II. These 2 compilations are the best rock you'll ever listen to.Adding a so-called Greatest Hits # 3 to the other two is a travesty.The only song that can be rescued from CD # 3 is ""Great Pretender"" and it's not even a Queen song.Don't buy this thing. Go for Greatest Hits 1 & 2. You won't need more."
2,"Why no ""Ties Your Mother Down""","It's beyond me how some knucklehead can put together a 3 disc Queen ""greatest hits"" and leave off ""Tie Your Mother Down."" If I'd been paying attention I probably would not have bought this. Now you know..."
3,CD#3,Would've given it 5 stars if not for that 3rd CD. It is a travesty that was included and I would never have bought the pack if I had found out sooner about that 3rd horrible CD. Still worth the low price just for the 1st & 2nd CD. 3rd CD...BLAH!
4,Just what I wanted!,"While this is not the completely definitive collection as some of the purists in other reviews would want, this is exactly what I wanted. I do not have any other Queen recordings and I was looking for a package that contained as much as possible in a single set. I am listening to this almost exclusively in the month since I received it and I am not worn out yet.If you don't have any Queen and you want to buy just one set, this will cover just about everything. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is the obvious omission of ""Tie Your Mother Down"" and a couple of recording level issues on a couple of tracks, notably ""We will rock you, We are the Champions"" which are strangely muted relative to most of the other tracks."
1,4 stars for the first 2 CDs,"Is there a reason for this?? NOOO, it doesn't. The first two CDs deals with with great music, but since 1991 (Freddie's death) there is no new music. All the compilations since Greatest hits 2 are only different ways to make money. DON'T BUY THIS COMPILATION"
2,"Omits MANY obvious, key tracks","This is okay, but doesn't have their '70s FM hits like ""Spread Your Wings"", ""I'm In Love With My Car"", ""'39"", ""Stone Cold Crazy"" and ""Sheer Heart Attack"", and unforgivably omits ""Love Of My Life"", ""Tie Your Mother Down"", ""Keep Yourself Alive"", and ""Get Down, Make Love"". Those songs are what made Queen famous, rather than afterthoughts like ""Body Language"" and ""The Invisible Man"" (included here).It is ridiculous that so many key tracks are omitted on a 3-CD set. None of the songs here are bad (Queen's worst is 10 times better than most bands' best), but these aren't the songs that gave Queen such a following. Young fans won't fully ""get it"" with this compilation. The wait for a comprehensive Queen package continues."
4,Freddie/Farokh Forever,"The sound quality is excellent; left nothing to be desired. Both the booklet and metallic slip case are nice and suitable for this type of compilation. Disc three could have been improved upon due to the very unnecessary inclusion of Elton John, George Michael, and Wyclef Jean. Instead of those tracks, more from the ""Heaven for Everyone"" album or other Queen songs should have been included. Overall, a great collection of timeless music for a great price."
3,Where's the technology?,I was about to buy this for no other reason than I thought ALL the songs would have been remastered. There are only a few that are. I won't be purchasing this one
2,One for three,The first CD of greatest hits was the best of all of them and was Classic Queen. The other two were poor and sclocky. Contains some poor remixes of older songs plus tweeking them with some Hip-hop and Rap. Not the Queen I grew up hearing. I wish I had done some sort of preview of the other CD's but it looked like good deal for a 3-CD set. Given another chance I'd only buy Hit's #1.
4,Discs I & II are Essencials,"This compilation will provide casual fans with the most popular Queen songs in the band's catalog. The packaging and booklet are good and informative with photos relevant to each time period and song. The first two discs have basically every hit known in the US and Europe. In my opinion Disc III is just a filler as it has just a few ""hits"". Most of this Disc III is just stuff thrown in to create a marketeable product. This does not mean that is a bad CD but it is no greatest hits as is stated."
5,Great Mix of Unlikely Hits,"The first disk shows Queen's best from the mid to late '70s; the second disk shows Queen's best from the '80s which really put them mainstream into pop culture. The third disk, while short of original Queen material shows the influence they had on the rest of the music scene. I believe that George Michael's version of ""Somebody to Love"" has to go down as one of the best remakes of any Queen tune."
3,Huh?,How do you compile 3 whole CDs worth of Queen songs and manage to leave off Keep Yourself Alive?
3,A Colorful Presentation of Knitwear,"In my opinion, the author has used many colurful combination of yarns within her designs, yet she has implemented common patterns within her designs. This book would be good for a beginning knitter, to help the knitter gain confidence in knitting with different yarn combinations. However, for experienced knitters, especially those knitters who work with fair isle, or searches for many other unique designs, they would find this book a bit boring."
3,"Check this out, before you order!!!","Ok so this is an awesome curling iron brand, but its not the same one they have pictured. Its actually way smaller. The one in the pic is proably 1 1/2 to 2 inches. This company doesn't refund shiping so make sure you actually want a half inch curling iron before you order this."
2,Best curling iron I have ever owned? No longer.,"This item broke after only 6 months of use. The cord must be defective since the iron is now only getting intermittent power and the on/off light is flickering. Because of the flickering power supply it no longer heats up. Have tried different outlets in the house - same problem. Amazon won't take returns after 30 days so now have to deal with Helen of Troy to hopefully replace this. Since my prior Helen of Troy iron (same model) gave out like this as well, eventually losing power and not heating up, I can only deduce that the wiring in this product is substandard.I still like the IDEA of this iron but it seems to be manufactured poorly. Bummer."
2,Hot tool not for single use,This product was a waste of $34 for me I cannot use it.I have used curling irons for years and thought I was buying another Iron that would last me a long time. There was no mention in the advertisement for this product that one person cannot handle this iron .It takes two hands and someone else working on your hair.The top bar is too hard to work by yourself.I had to buy another iron elsewhere and felt I had been deceived with a false add and it was expensive buying two irons.
2,"Are there two ""Sandra Browns"" ?","The first novel I read from this writer was ""exclusive"" , which I loved, so I told myself who's this and where has it been 'till now! But when I started buying several titles from the same author I realized they were not as nearly as good as ""Exclusive"" or even ""Fat Tuesday"". This novel; ""A treasure worth seeking"", is so predictable and boring that is not good even for a beach read. And people talk about ""sexual tension""? there is none if you know what's going to happen and there's no other paralel story! Give me a break, Sandra Brown."
3,Some Treasure Should Stay Buried,"I like Ms. Brown's works. This is a reprint of a 1992 issue. And, I must say I was disappointed. Thankfully, I have seen her evolve as an authoress with more depth in some of her later works such as ""Exclusive"" and ""The Witness"".In this book, Erin is involved with a G-man who is also investigating her lost brother. Not much action here. Rather bland romance mystery-if that is what she was going for.other reading suggestions: ""The Ghost"" by Danielle Steel, ""Grand Passion"" by Jayne Krentz, and for a thriller ""Ashes To Ashes"" by Tami HoagYour interest & comment votes are appreciated--CDS"
3,Hmmm...,"Actually I prefer Sandra Brown's novels which had some suspense in it, like The Witness or Charade. I liked The Witness. This novel is well...yeah, not that good. It's predictable...fast-paced but predictable."
2,It was not a sweet love story!!!!,"First off what man in their right mind kiss someone only minutes after you meet them, oh wait what am I talking about? Besides that further into the story Erin needs help zipping up her dress and of course Lance is the only one around to help her. He does more then zip up her dress he fondles and gropes her and then comes to his senses and helps her with her dress.He knew pretty much from the beginning that she wasnt helping her long lost brother with the robbery yet he keeps her around to mess with her sexually.The end of the book was even worse. Lance comes to see her at her office and she doesnt even bother to tell him she is pregnant with his child. Then of course some who they live happily ever after. blah blah blahdont waste your time"
2,Yuck! I was bored silly!,"This storyline was really lame! I can't even say anything good about the characters because they were all really annoying! I am a huge Sandra Brown fan, but this one is one I wish I had skipped!"
1,Don't Bother!,"This book is an excellent example of why one should NOT put a new cover on a book written in 1982! It has NOT improved in the last 30 years and would never be published today. The mystery is never solved, the hero would be arrested for that kind of behavior today and the whole thing was generally disappointing."
4,Not too bad...,"A Treasure Worth Seeking finds it's way into the category of pretty good. Not every book can be the best, and as usual, people tend to forget that. This was one of Sandra Brown's books that was written before she became popular and was written under a pen name. Of course she has improved over time. That happens with everyone. It's the old practice makes perfect line.This book was a good read. It's not anything heavy and it's not a book that's going to keep you up all night. It's only 256 pages long and the print is pretty large. This is a great book for a plane ride or while sitting on the beach. Sometimes you want to read something that's nice and light, and this book suits that.Take the time and read this one. I don't think anyone will be really disappointed. I know I wasn't."
1,Utter rubbish,"I didn't think it would be possible to be even more fatuous than Austin Powers, but this author succeeds.I almost cheered when I found a full English sentence. The books read at about the level of ""See Spot Run.""As for amusing, if you like slapstick comedy, fine, if not, forget it.As for sexy, there are 2 love scenes in the whole of the book you have to wait until page 300 for.A romance is supposed to be a guy and girl falling in love, not continually tearing around all over the place with absurd gadgets and even more absurd dialogue, and eventually deciding they might as well go to bed together to see how it works out."
4,Landing on Boardwalk,"I know that it's difficult to believe that anything written by an author with the last name of Bangs could be worthy of the nearly 400 pages that it is printed on, but belive it, Nina knows her stuff. With her fourth full-length novel, she is leaning towards less of the shocking smuttiness of her earlier works, but if you like a steamy fantasy, this will fill the bill. Even with wholly unbelievable plots, magical cats, and the perfect man always at the unsuspecting female's fingertips, Nina has a way of drawing you into the world she has created. I have to admit, after not reading romance novels since I was 14, Nina sucked me back in. She has imagination and an excellent style. If you like the other ones, read this one too. If you laugh at those of us that you see reading books like this, pick one up, you'll be surprised what treasures you can find when you lease expect it."
4,"I Totally Hearted This Book, but Don't Start Here If You are New to the Series","I had saved up all three of the last books in this series for a Bren orgy (Destroyer, this one andDeliverer) and a nasty summer cold seemed just the right occasion to lock myself up with cold remedies, kleenex and books by C. J. Cherryh.I've been a fan from the start so I was having a great time with Banichi, Jago, Ilsidi and the rest of the Atevi cast when it occurred to me that very likely if I had started this series with this book I would be incredibly lost. And the further I read the more I decided that new readers would need a ""Companion"" volume to figure everything out.So if you have read previous books this one is a good read, if you haven't-- go back and start withForeigner(and I envy you the chance to read the series for the first time.)"
5,Next foreigner book by Cherryh,"Great as usual. Took me most of the night, but I enjoyed my reread. Onward to the next bookIn series."
4,Last great Caravan album.,"This is the first recording following Dave Sinclair's departure. Richard Sinclair is still present for this session and delivers some of his most inspired bass playing. This recording has a decidedly jazzier feel than prior efforts but does not sway too far from Caravan's sound. As usual the musicianship is solid, as are the compositions. Following this effort Caravan would begin a slow but gradual decline in recording efforts with the comings and goings of various members. For their finest hour, see The Land of Grey and Pink. This one is highly recommended...Simon"
3,waterloo lily,"I've been into Caravan since the mid 1970ies although I only had 3 of their albums. I finally decided to increase my Caravan catelog & decided the final CD I would get is Waterloo Lily. I don't rate it near their top but I can see how they were progressing at the time into what they became (an almost forgotten jazzy folk blues rock band)I would reccommend this CD only for fans. For non fans try the live with the New Symphoma CD, as well as the Land of Pink & Gray, Blind Dog at St.Dunstans & Cunning Stunts (I always have to be careful not to miss the C & S up). I always wish I had seen them live."
4,A jazzier turn for Caravan,Waterloo Lily : A change of pace for Caravan with the (temporary) loss of Dave Sinclair on keyboards. More Canterbury music
5,Definitely the scariest Dr. Who episodes when I was a child......,"I agree with a previous review, this was definitely the scariest run of episodes. They were a part of nightmares I had for years when I was younger (hehe), and the best part about it is that the psychological play on horror acheived with the now ""low-budget/b-rated"" special effects forced the imaginations of the writers and directors to scare the [...] of you with no gimmicks involved. The use of an entity that killed in that manner, mostly invisible and mostly unstoppable at first had me more nervous than going to the beach after seeing Jaws for the first time. I hope it makes it to DVD soon."
3,"Oh... It's okay, I guess.","On many reveiws on this website, people tend to go from one extreme to the other(eg. 5*'s to 1) I am not afraid to rate in the middle sometimes. This is one of those times. While this is a good watch, and enjoyable, it is just Okay. Like Monster of Peledon, it's neither good or bad. It starts out on some planet and a ship trying desparately to escape orbit. Prentis Handcock and Freddie Yagar are very good at their rolls. Their are many strong actors in this but it is somewhat lacking in some areas. Mostly it's an effort to try and escape the planet and a madness that effects Handcock's, and Yagar's characters."
3,Beautiful but tarnishing,I love the look of this product but fear that my set is defective - I have only owned it for about 6 weeks and it is tarnishing like silver - I bought it because it said that it was dishwasher safe - has anyone else had this experience?
5,Perfect!,My grandson requests this movie each time he visits so ended up purchasing and downloading on my blue ray. Entertaining and heart warming - can't go wrong with this one!
5,Just what my son wanted...,"My son goes through phases of liking and loving different shows. Around 6 pm one evening, my son informed me that he wanted to watch Clifford. Unfortunately for him Clifford wasn't on television. I quickly looked up Clifford DVDs on Amazon and bought two. This was one of them. When it arrived, we watched the DVD on and off for the next few days. He watches it at least one a week.Did this movie win any Oscars??? NO but it does serve its purpose of providing family friendly entertainment for my two year old son."
2,Cracked Case,"The movie is great, but it was said to be in great condition. The dvd has some slight scratches and even pauses for a few seconds in 2 places and the case was completely cracked up. No inserts were with it, which is no big deal. I order from Amazon all of the time and this is the first time I was disappointed."
3,Warning - this isn't your PBS Cartoon,My son loves Clifford the Big Red Dog and enjoys the PBS cartoons. We watched the Really Big Movie on a family trip. My 2-year-old burst out crying when Clifford was kidnapped and in danger of being hurt by multitudes of lassoing cowboys. This might be a better movie for an older child.
3,Just okay....for very young child,"My toddler loves the Clifford PBS series, and I thought she'd like this too....but not as much, turns out! Story is cute, voices are great, but the animation is not the same, and her attention was not as held by this dvd. Maybe for older kids it would be different. Good buy, though!"
5,A fantastic update for a classic character!,"My three year old loves Clifford books and the series on PBS. However, I was skeptical about getting this movie for her. But, we both love it! What I really like is that all of the voices from the series (John Ritter, Cree Summer, etc) are in the movie. I think this is really important to little minds who may not understand why Clifford is sounding different. The animation is not as advanced as some other big screen releases, but it is much more detailed than the series. It's bright, colorful, and fun to watch. The plot itself is not overly scary. My daughter won't watch Disney movies because she gets scared, but this didn't bother her at all. A great movie!!!"
3,The kind of book that gets students shot in study hall.,"Equality is a lie. Altruism is a lie. Decency toward your fellow man is a trap. This is the message of Ragnar Redbeard's late nineteenth century screed against religeon, authority and pretty much everyone who isn't you. Redbeard takes a good hard look at all of the factors that supposedly drive the world and then ridicules them until the reader is forced to feel emberassed that one could ever think that there is more to life than competition to the death. Arnold's great line from ""Conan the Barbarian"" comes to mind: ""Crush your enemies, see them driven before you and... hear the lamentations of their women"". So beware. I mean, it's a helluva read, loaded with all sorts of quotable passages and Redbeard's own Darwinist poetry (and even some latin - 19th century, y'know), but as philosophies for life go, it's the sort of thing that could get you into trouble with the law if you take it too seriously. Highly reccomended for high school outcasts."
3,A nice addition to the corpus,"I must confess I - already owning several editions of this work - only bought this book because of the promise the identity of its author would be revealed. And although Mr. Conder concludes ""Perhaps Redbeard's true identity will forever remain a mystery"" (page x), he's certainly done a thorough detective's job. It's interesting to note that Conder dismisses Anton LaVey's identification of Redbeard with Jack London on pages iii-iv, yet provides an important connection between these two literary giants on page vii, thereby adding more evidence to LaVey's thesis, which offers two - not one! - possible solutions for the Might is Right manuscript in London's handwriting.This edition's pros are Conder's informative introduction, footnotes and other clarifications. Its contra is its resemblance to a computer printout. But perhaps that is staying true to form for a work which started out in typewritten form in 1890 c.e."
2,Might Is Right,"This is ""one of a kind"". It really opens your eyes to things that are usually ignored. Its so straight forward, I could not believe it. Must have in your collection. Thanks a lot!!!!"
5,Not for Sissys,"Or Intellectual wimps that hide behind complex philosophical / Psychological rubbish in an attempt to explain and justify why they dont eat Red Meat, Meet the world head on and Go and get what they really want. Ex: If you are a guy and women arent attracted to you, then get with the program instead of whining about how they only like jerks. Hahahaha, the truth is, Being Nice in a Man is completely obnoxious and un-natural; it will never trigger attraction in a female. This is the kind of insight you can garner from this text. This is a Great wake up call for wimpus intellectuallis to start lifting weights, practicing Karate and seeing the world in a Masculine sense."
1,*sigh*,"More crap from the 14 word morons. Please, don't mistake this b.s. for something that resembles literature in the vaguest sense."
4,"Good book, good read","I got the book because I am a fan of the Satanic Bible, which was largley based on this book. The language of the book is a little tough to get through at some points. *Please note that this book is very large, in height and width. It is about the size of a school text book. Very awkward."
5,INTENSE!,"This book throws Social Darwinism right through your picture window and laughs at your possible injuries. Definitely not for the faint of mind, as well as heart."
5,What we need to know,As a grandmother of a diabetic granddaughter this book was so informative. I am the worrier asking if she is o.k. constantly. Now I have an new outlook on that. Back off Grandma. She takes great care of herself and let her do it. She asks for help if she needs it. A new perspective on how she feels. A fabulous book.
3,Growing Up With Diabetes: What children want...,"This is a well-intended but ultimately limited book that aims to embrace the large issue of shaping parental understanding of and response to their children's diabetes. This ambition is not well served by the book's brevity; given the author's own premise that diabetes is different for every child and every family, greater depth and breadth of discussion of the many issues at hand peppered with presentation and analysis of specific anecdotes would be useful here. As the mother of a newly diagnosed 12 year-old son, I think that this book probably best serves as a primer for affected families with younger children. I should think that the book's topic might be specifically addressed to families of adolescents (vs. younger children)in a separate work."
1,Growing Up with Diabetes: What Children Want Their Parents to Know,"I was Disappointed with this book. My 2 year old son was recently diagonosed with Type 1 and from the title of the book I would have thought the book was about a child who has had this diasease for longer than the age of 11 years old. I was expecting the girl to have had diabetes at a very young age. The title should be ""Growing up with diabetes in my teen years"""
5,Excellent CD from In my opinion best yet though Tanya is exceptional performer,This is a muct have cd. I love Tanya Tucker music. This cd is my favorite. I recommend to anyone to buy this even if only plan to buy one of Tanyas cd buy this one.
4,Miss T rocks it!,"I bought this cd after buying 2 concert dvds of Tanya's, which I also recommend. She's a spirited performer with an immense back catalog of great tunes. Good production and vocals, excellent songwriting. She really is the best country singer out there today. Wish she'd play shows in NYC more. ""Old Weakness"" sounds like a Rolling Stones song and Miss T works it."
5,Tanya Tucker,"Back with a vengance, this album showcases one of the most recognizable voices in country music. A must buy for all of those folks who are hearing too much pop ... at their local country station."
5,Almost as good as Raiders . . .,"But a mighty fine movie on it's own. Eight years after the release of Raiders, George and Steven finally made a worthy sequel, not as dark or ""real"" as Raiders, but polished in all the right ways. Sean Connery really is the perfect choice for Dr. Henry Jones Sr., looking down his nose at Junior's adventures in a nice ironic nod to the Bond years.The baddies are again the Nazis (because we hate those guys) and the quest, this time, is for the Holy Grail. There aren't any clapping coconuts or african swallows (no, make that european) but what you will find is a great adventure story with two of the best actors of their generations showing off what great chemistry is all about."
4,Probably The Best Of The Series,"""The Last Crusade"" would have to be the best of the Indiana Jones Trilogy. Everything's here. Imagination, action, etc. It's about time they released the trilogy on DVD."
5,PERFECT!!!,"This has got to be the best adventure movie ever!! When I think of adventure, I think of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Every role is cast DEAD-ON, every detail makes perfect sense, and its really cool how they weave so many storylines together without diminishing any of them. The actors are all so excellent, I found myself perusing movie guides for other movies they had been in, and seeing them. This is one of those movies where everything comes together, there isnt a minute of downtime, and you may even want to see it twice in a row. The first scenes from 1912 work perfectly in part 3, as by now you know much about Indy but still learn more. This flashback would not have worked nearly as well in the previous two films as it does here. All I have left to say is I really hope they do part 4 like I read somewhere. That would be my Phantom Menace!"
5,A N ADVENTURE YOU WON'T FORGET,"I must be blunt, this movie was great! Of course all the Indiana Jones movies were great, but this one takes the cake. In this one,Indy must save his father from the Nazis. Indy's father is a Holy Grial fanatic and together they must stop the Nazis from taking the Grail from its resting place."
5,"Add in Sean Connery, and you've got the best Indy film yet","If I had to choose a favorite Indy film, this is the one I would select immediately. The Last Crusade is without a doubt the best Indy film of all, even surpassing Raiders. It has the same formula as Raiders (the Nazis are here, Marcus & Sallah return, a Biblical artifact is being searched, etc.), but it has more action, more humor, and also a welcome addition to the entire franchise, which is Sean Connery as Henry Jones. Connery is perfect as Indy's father, and the chemistry between the two main leads is really enjoyable to watch. A few of the special effects shots may look a bit dated, but who cares? Last Crusade is the ultimate Indy film. Temple of Doom may be too dark, Crystal Skull may be too silly, Raiders is perfectly fine, but Last Crusade is the one that has the most. And it does its job really well: it entertains us in the most excellent way possible. A great action-adventure, indeed.Grade: A"
5,DVD review,This DVD was received within the time frame stated and was in perfect condition. Buying used DVD's is a great money saver.
4,A Magnificent Return to What Had Been,"After the dismal Temple of Doom, I hoped the next Indiana Jones movie would somehow get the story back on track. I hoped for three dimensional characters, a decent storyline, not one wild chase after another. I am pleased to say Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was that, and a lot more!Indiana Jones must go to Europe to find his estranged father, played by the great Sean Connery. As fate has it, he finds himself drawn into his father's obsessive quest for the mythical Holy Grail, complete with nazis, femme fatales, and everything else that made the first film a hit.Forget the second one, people, THIS is the true sequel."
5,"my favorite, could be your's too","""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" is my favorite movie of all time. Filled with adventure (at Grunwald Castle), humor (involving Venitian librarian), and Nazis getting killed (by Indy and his father, played by the illustrious Sean Connery), it is almost everything you could want in a film. To watch this movie erases any doubt as to how Mr. Ford became an international sex symol. An exciting and enduring classic."
3,WEAKEST OF THE INDY MOVIES,"This Indy movie was weak--not much of an action film but more of a comedy. If anything, though, see it. HF is good, so is Connery. But you just might get sick at the fact Indy and his Dad were with the same woman."
5,It's a really good movie that's full of excitement,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!! Harrison Ford is DA BOMB in this movie! Full of adventure and excitement, this will leave you clinging until the end! This is the best movie out of the Triology, and I can't ever get enough of it! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!! Sean Connery is also really awesome!"
5,Ford Classic 3,"Indy fans will like this one. It's a return to the original idea behind the story. I believe George Lucas had more to do with part two. Read that one for more. The third installment finds our hero looking for his missing father, a major Christian artifact enthusiast, who was on a hunt for the holy grail when he want missing. Indiana must weave through more Nazis, lies, deception and traps to rescue his father. No collection is complete without all three of these films."
3,Buy the original version,"I've only gotten to watch this one once, but I swear there are a few things cut out of it. I really wasn't expecting that! Maybe added things, but not cuts!"
5,Indiana Jones last crusade.,"Great transaction. Loved this movie, The storyof Knights still living and protecting the chalice of Christ at the last supper was great."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Unless you've had someone coddle you your whole life, Fodor's How to Take a Road Trip is a waste of time. Banal common sense info you don't need to buy. For example, it takes a whole page to explain where to find a road map: bookstore, autoclub, gas station, on line, rest stops. Don't expect any MacGyver tricks of the road---like how to open your car door if you locked your keys inside. Fodor's advice: bring a spare set. This book is nothing more than an empty gimmick."
1,Waste of Money,I wish I had read the reviews on this book before I bought it. The book talks about common sense items that anyone can figure out on their home. A waste of my money & time.
1,Only wish there were a 'zero stars' option,"The very best thing I can say about this lame waste of trees purporting to be a travel guide is that at least I didn't BUY it...It was just an impulse grab it at the library checkout desk. But still, I'll never get the time it wasted back. All copies should be burned with the author and editors on top as a warning to others."
1,Undercooks at altitude,"Despite the package's claim that ""The sensor accounts for the number of eggs, the amount of water, even the altitude at which the eggs are being cooked."" this severely undercooks eggs at 6500 feet. Pulled one egg at the ""medium"" point to test - yuck! Left the rest until the ""hard"" mark - actually accidentally let them go all the way to solid black (well past the hard mark) and still got centers not fully cooked.Ours might have been a dud, but my guess is that this item doesn't really account for altitude. Caveat emptor for those who live above 5000 feet...."
1,Not recommended!,"Emits a strong ""fiberglass"" smell when boiling eggs. As egg shells are quite permeable, I'm concerned that some of the resin components may migrate into the eggs. I'm returning this and getting a conventional timer."
3,"Works, but...",It seems to get the timing right but it smells of burning plastic. I've only used it twice so maybe this will stop.
4,Good CD,I have several 2002 CD's and this one is as good as the rest. Very peaceful and relaxing. They are very talented.
5,The best of X-Japan,"This is essentially a greatest hits album, but done live. All their best songs are on this album, and it is nothing short of breathtaking; full of kicking hard rock and metal songs and also soaring ballards. I first listened to X-Japan when I was in Japan studying for my degree and, being a fan of hard rock and heavy metal, I took an immediate shine to them. From the intro you know that this is something different. From the VAST mid arena punch along section in the middle of Orugazumu (you'll know what I mean when you hear it), to the crowd singing the chorus of Endless Rain by themselves for literally around 10 minutes this is something which I have not heard before. Other good songs on the album are songs such as Weekend, Rusty Nail and Say Anything. If you are into metal, and are bored of all the bands like limp bizkit out there, I urge you to check this out. Its old school rock with a twist and its really good."
4,Good and Getting Better,"Charlotte Magazine has improved greatly during the 4 years I've lived in Charlotte. My impression 4 years ago was that the articles didn't have much depth and covered the local area with an almost marketing like view of Charlotte (everything's great here!). It just didn't present balanced and critical content as you would find in a great city magazine such as the Washingtonian. Fortunately, during the last 4 years the magazine has improved and now the articles have depth and demonstrate critical thinking and balanced views; which you won't find in the shallow and barely literate Charlotte Observer. The still have a little way to go, but they've made great progress in the quality of the publication, which is why I subscribed. The ""event's"" section is good for mainstream actives and covers quite a large number of events. Their coverage of unique, local retail shops and restaurants is also very good. If you live in Charlotte or plan to move here, I recommend you subscribe."
4,Hooray for Robin Kane!,"I like the Robin Kane books a lot. This one was the first one I read. I would say that I enjoyed this book much more than I enjoy Nancy Drew books. Also, Robin is thirteen, and Nancy Drew is eighteen. (not many eighteen year old's read Nancy Drew do they?) In this mystery, Nugget, one of Mindy and Michael's father's horses, which is going to be in a movie he is making, disappears. Can Robin, Mindy, Michael and Kevin find Nugget? I liked how Mindy and Michael are the children of a movie producer. This wasn't my favorite Robin Kane mystery, but it's good, and you need to read it to understand the other books better. I wasn't very happy that they obviously don't publish these books anymore, but glad that you can still buy them used. Hooray for Robin Kane!"
2,Solid chunk of plastic,"The item shipped in about 5 -6 days (about normal) and arrives in a thin cardboard box (nothing else). Nothing unusually good or bad about the product or the service, though I will add a warning to any Rode Classic (1) owners that this shockmount is definitely not suitable for that original model Classic - despite what Rode themselves might say. I was advised by Rode that I could modify the mount by cutting a hole in the bottom (this thing is just made of thick plastic) to pass the cable through, but that in no way makes it useful anyway as the mic is not held in place in the mount. Compared to the mounts from even self-professed low-end companies like MXL, this shock mount is pretty cheap and flimsy looking - of course it may work beautifully with the newer Rode mics for which it was intended ..."
3,Elastic will fail after extended use,"Shockmount itself is solid, works great with my Rode K2 mic. However, the elastic wears out relatively quickly (around 8 months to 1 year) due to the weight of the microphone. Luckily, replacement elastic can be purchased for around $8-10 online. I would purchase it ahead of time so you're not stuck with a floppy shockmount for a recording session."
3,how to know wildflowers,A friend had read the library copy of this book and wanted to purchase her own copy. She loved the format and would recommend it as a gift of those who like wildflowers
3,Not quite the same as American Pie,"We keep getting further from the real movie, especially on this one. Still funny, but just not the same. Miss the real cast."
2,Great Language Features,"Band Camp was funny, but not as good as the first two American Pie movies. It was, however, on par with the third movie in the series. There were the usual silly, outrageous pranks and there were a few characters from the previous movies, but not the main characters. This movie was fun and worth watching, but probably not really worth watching again EXCEPT for the the language features. The movie comes dubbed in Spanish and French, plus you can have subtitles in several languages while viewing the movie in any language. SO, this movie might provide a fun way of developing or brushing up on your foreign language skills!"
2,Not worth your time,"though it may seem funny in the ads, it wasnt, didnot have the same humor as before...It was too slapstick, and not natural like the trilogy..."
1,This was the worse one,"All the American Pie movies have their plus side. This one basically sucked. It was a chore to watch the whole movie. The others I have watched 3 or 4 times, I will not watch this one again."
2,A few slices short of a pie.,"This one will be brief. The movie is an excuse for young actors to use the ""F"" word and demonstrate that cannot act. The characters are cheap rip-offs of the original, which is to say one-dimensional. American Pie presents Band Camp certainly does not flesh them out. One final note: Eugene Levy- How much cash had to be thrown at your to take this one on?"
2,Disappointing,"There is not much to say about this movie. It wasn't the worst movie in the world, yet as a fan of the other American Pie movies, I was disappointed. My main problem with it was that it lacked substance, as another reviewer mentioned. I found the ending to be a little forced, and as for the humor, I can only remember one time that I actually laughed out loud--and even that time it was more like a small chuckle. I also found myself checking the clock quite frequently towards the end.I am guessing that, in general, this movie will probably be most revered by the younger crowd (mid-to-late teens) as anyone looking for mature comedy or depth (or anyone who has seen a fair share of great movies) will not be impressed."
1,Another Dumb Teen Movie...,Just bad...Just Dumb...Just a waste of time...Is this crap supposed to be funny? If you like the others...which means you have to be half brain dead...then buy this one too to complete the whole crappy set...
2,Pretty Lame,"Well, this came out here in New Zealand about half way through October, I don't know why its taking so long to be realeased here. But don't worry its not worth the wait. I has maybe 2 American Pie standard funny parts, the rest is really average. The guy that plays Stifflers brother is quite good, maybe a bit to good, instead of playing his brother he comes across as trying to act EXACTLY like Stiffler. Theres also a lot of near nudity parts, this usually doesn't bother me but its really obvious they used bad editing to basically cut everthing, which as you isn't like and American Pie movie. Rent if you must, but don't buy."
5,American Pie Band Camp (Unrated),"Not all the orginal characters , but along the same story of American pie . A lot of T&A , very funny."
3,by far the worst A.P movie,its a little boring. its funny but not like the other pie movies. its a good movie but it doesnt amount to crap against other A.P movies.BEST PIE MOVIES IN ORDER1. American Pie2. American Reunion3. American Pie 24. American Wedding5. American Pie: Beta House6. American Pie: The Naked Mile7. American Pie: Book of Love8. American Pie: Band Campnot the best slice of Pie...
4,When did stifler have a little brother!,"Nicholas Carroll, Stifler established he had a little brother in the second American pie movie so take you head out of your A** and actually watch the movies before you write a review.(that would be chapter 14. The Wrong Stifler in American Pie 2). This movie was better than the American Wedding movie and on the same line with the American Pie 2 movie... I bought this movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. IMHO, worth a watch."
3,"Nice, not as expected","I thought that this movie would be nicer than the 3 ones be4, but no it is very normal and the idea was very ordinary. Sometimes they think it is so funny but no it is silly and lame. Nothing would happen like that in real life. Made me also disgusted in some seens. Sun tan made of.....comeon!"
5,I Kept Watching This Movie Waiting For Something Funny To Happen!,"This is a sorry excuse for a comedy. Like most sequels the Geek Hollywood Scriptwriters have ""gone back to the well"" one more time and lo and behold , this movie proves that the well has indeed run dry. The Sherminator is now a Guidence Counsellor which only goes to prove that a Geek Is A Geek Is A Geek even if he gets an education. He sends Mat Stifler to band camp as a type of punishment and then Stifler violates every Privacy Law on the Satutes by filming girls in the shower , locker rooms et al.Somebody should tell Mat that according to American Weeding his older brother became a caring, sensitive guy. This movie is only redeemed by the presence of Ginger Lynn Allen which really doesn't say much for the rest of the cast ."
3,GOOD,"Don't get me wrong the frist 3 were better by far, but this movie wes great too. once I saw who the prisable of the school was, I knew that it was going to be a good movie. the casting wes good but i would cast somebuty elce to be the goth mexacin girl. (EWWW) I almost vommit on my slef!"
2,My Philosophy of Sequels,Im 10 years old and i like sequels that have numbers in them. As far as im consurned if it doesnt have a number its not a sequel to me! Cheaper By the Dozen 2 was a sequel because it had the number 2 in it. American Wedding should have been called American Pie 3: The Wedding and this peice of junk should have been called American Pie 4: BAND CAMP. I thought this movie was ok but i asked my brother to bring it back to the store because i felt it wasnt a sequel because it didt have a number on it it sayed the word Presents!!!!

3,In The Middle,I like the concept of it but when I actually got the item it was very small compared to regular belt buckles. This should have been much larger and I would appreciated it more.
3,Apocrypha Now,"Well, I enjoyed reading it... but the deliberate use of a raving psycho and his psuedo intellectual fan boy to deliver these revelations made it less valuable. An average Hunter would probably want to hunt this guy down not for supernatural reasons but because he is clearly mental and a danger to society. The psychotic ramblings aside the book laid out some interesting theories, and some connections to the Exalted Gameline world which are cool. All in all, it was no Book of Nod."
2,Not Worth The Effort,"This book, while keeping with the storyline of Hunter, is written in such a way as that by the time your able to decipher what the author is trying to say, its simply not worth the effort.i can't really see the point of this book. It has information that the Hunter-Creed books explain in greater detail and in easier-to-understand terms.As it is, the author who wrote this book (or, atleast the point of view that it was supposed to be written in) was insane, or was at least considered insane.So, if you want to read a book written by someone who is insane, this would be a good place to start."
4,Anything Ann does is great!,"Years ago, she was at a book signing. She complimented me on my tie. Love this book and love Ann!"
1,Empty Promises misses the mark.,"This time around with Empty Promises, I felt cheated. Don't mind paying for a true crime book if it is a good one, but in this case it didn't happen. These stories were obviously left over from Ann's files; ones that were just not ready for print. Unfortunately for us readers, they should have remained in the files. In all honesty, I didn't recommend this book to my friends so we won't be hopping aboard the train anytime soon."
3,Not Her Best,"Fans of Ann Rule will enjoy reading this. However, it is by no means her best story. The characters and story are fairly simple compared to the topics that she usually writes about. As a result, this one is no nearly as suspenseful, making it impossible to really get involved in the story."
2,"I am a loyal fan of Ann's, but................","I found this book to be unspectacular. Usually I devour her stories in 2 to 3 days, but I put this one aside for a week, and when I resumed reading I had to force myself to plough through it. Some of the cases described within are no more dramatic than a Saturday night drunken brawl in a sleazy bar. Where is her usual saga of suspense, intrigue, and pathos, all of which are noteably absent here? Accused by some of writing repetitively, this book is the opposite - veering away from the descriptive details contained in her other excellent works, details which are engrossing and interesting and suscitate the eternal ""Why"" queries that accompany the pondering of criminal behaviour. However, in this instance, the only ""Why"" question you will ask will be this - ""Why did I buy this book?"""
2,"Ann Rule ""going through the motions""....","In yet another installment of Ann Rule's collection of true crime stories we see Ann Rule at her worst. Well I should say that at her best Ann Rule does a brilliant job of analyzing criminals, victims, crimes and the US justice system. She has the knack of drilling down into minute detail without being boring. However with 'Empty Promises...' the author doesn't go into any detail and, worse, the stories she relates are your basic slasher crimes; we've seen them all before (and were grossed out).At the very least Ann Rule still writes in a very readable, personable sort of way. So the book is a painless waste of time. If Ms. Rule reads this review can I ask her, as a loyal fan, to dispense with these half-hearted stories (as an attempt to cash in on her name?) and give us more classics like 'If You Really Loved Me' or 'Dead By Sunset'.Bottom line: Ann Rule on a very off day. Don't waste your money."
3,Doesn't Live Up to Her Talent Level,"I have read everything Ann Rule has written (including the books written under her male pen name) and I have noticed (in general) a sloping off of depth in most of her more recent works, starting with the book ""The End of the Dream."" I'm not sure why she is writing in a shallower manner -- I wonder if she is being put under pressure by her publisher or her editors?""Broken Promises"" just doesn't deliver the probing analysis, the unflinching examination of the criminal mind, or the level of detail her previous books such as ""Dead By Sunset"" delivered. As I read this book, I felt as if I were watching a Lifetime TV special. The writing seems shallow to me. However, if you are an Ann Rule fan you will probably want to read this book, as it is still far better than most true-crime offerings.On a more positive note, I thought ""Deadly Seducer"" was fabulous and that it lived up to Rule's talent level. I know she can still deliver. I will look forward to her next book."
3,It seems to lack her usually excellent touch.,"I love Ann Rule's books; love the great detail that she goes into, but, some of these stories just seemed empty to me. ""Bitter Lake"" was a little weird - guy commits 2 murders, gets caught a few hours later...that's it. I will still look forward to any book she writes, but this one was just a little off."
3,Empty Promises,"As an avid fan of Ann Rule and her true crime books, I read each new one as they come out. These books make for some good reading while waiting in airports or on the plane. Empty Promises has one longer story and several short stories of love gone wrong. These are stories of manipulative and abusive relationships which end in violence. This collection is not her best work, but it is still a worth-while read."
5,Tovolo silicone splatter screen,This silicone splatter screen bears out the recommendation of a newspaper article. I was unable to find it in local stores.
2,Didn't appeal to me - I wish I hadn't bought it!,I can't understand why this book has been so highly rated. I bought it on the basis of the other reviews. I have found it lacking in all the areas I have needed to look up. I have found one or two useful things as well; but it seems to lack some basic (and I don't mean beginner) coverage. For example INSERTs are covered; yet there isn't any coverage about how to return an id from the INSERT. I believe the book could be improved just by addressing some of the questions being asked on SQL/VB sites. I also did not like the layout of the book. I have used SQL since the early days (1983).
2,Buyer Beware: Joe Celko does the forward,"I must have missed something the other 130 reviewers found so great about this book. There is a dirth of what I consider to be ""good T-SQL guides"". Unfortunately, this publication is another in a long line of misses. I didn't find the author's technical explanations of his own examples, brillant though they may be, very indepth or complete, even. There seemed to be an excessive amount of multi-page ""code listings"", which become difficult to follow after a while. Mr. Henderson seems to be styling his writing after his long-winded friend, Joe Celko. Perhaps the holy grail which I seek, in the name of ""T-SQL for T-SQL dummies, but for otherwise database and programming Smarties"", shall remain interminably elusive.I also bought Mr. H's Guru's guide to SQL Stored Procs, which on the face of it seems to be more promising. Let us pray."
5,The best books available on SQL SERVER,"The Guru Guide books are the best books available for SQL SERVER. I have all three and never ceased to be impressed with how much I learn each time I read one of them.Each book requires and rewards careful rereading. There is always more there than you glean the first time. I am still reading the first one nearly four years after I originally bought it. I never cease to find some new nuggest when I research a solution to my latest SQL SERVER challenge.I also like the non-technical writing in each book. The personal anecdotes, the essays, the quotes at the head of each chapter: they all give you the impression that you are being taught by, as Ron Soukup says, a veteran developer who knows what he is talking about because he has lived it."
5,How Do I Get There From Here?,"I'm a programmer with just enough Transact-SQL experience to have bad habits. I spent ages searching for a book that could fill the holes in my basic understanding while providing more complex, useable examples of how experts squeeze the best out of SQL Server. Ken Henderson's ""The Guru's Guide to Transact-SQL"" fits the profile exactly.This book has provided a workable, easily-understood common standard amongst all the programmers in our shop. Henderson's techniques are consistent, clear and as free of jargon as possible with such a complex subject. I wish we'd started with this book, rather than finding it along the way by accident, because it would have saved us even more time and money.We have seen quite startling improvements in the performance of our SQL Server code since adopting the ""Henderson Method"" of writing T-SQL. In our view, there are many experts, but only One Guru. Well done!"
4,A good book for a developer,"The material is well-written, concise and to-the-point. No lengthy, ego-tripping novellas here. Presents information not always apparent when consulting the technical doc's. Provides some good examples. Good food-for-thought, that's presented for quick & easy reading. The included CD is totally useless (the s/w program didn't work, and even if it had, SQL Server's Query Analyzer is already available and DOES work.) Recommended for MS SQL Server programming tasks; NOT a DBA resourse."
5,"Not for beginners, but a darn fine book nonetheless","Though this book is way too advanced for the average beginner, if you have a bit of Transact-sql under your belt, the Guru's Guide is your fastest ticket to becoming an expert. The book assumes you've read through the Books Online, so if you haven't, you'll definitely want to before diving in.Once you have a basic foundation on which to build and extend your knowledge, you'll find a treasure trove of useful info and expert advice in this book. The chapters on Cursors, Statistical Functions, Fulltext Searching, and OLE Automation are chalk-full of expert insights and are masterfully done, as is the rest of the book.As a whole, the book is among the best technical books I've ever read. I consult on SQL Server projects large and small here in the Bay area, and I often carry the book with me from client to client. I find myself reading and re-reading passages to really glean all that's there. I can recommend this book without reservation."
5,The perfect computer book,This is the perfect computer book. I think what I like the most is how easily it reads. What a great writer. He makes learning fun. I like the abundance of code to. It's refreshing to read a computer book that's enlightening and a good read at the same time. It makes learning transact-sql so much easier. Thanks for the chapter on Transaction Management. It was worth the price of the book alone (true for most of the chapters in the book - good stuff).
5,A Must-Have,"Anyone who uses Microsoft SQL Server or Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (or any of the related products) must have this book on the shelf. It is THE best-written and best-organized computer book I have come across. It picks up where the manual leaves off. Despite its name, this book is useful for someone who has just a little knowledge of T-SQL, as well as advanced users. Chapters 1 and 6 serve the beginner well. The information on performace tuning is great for the more experienced user. Even DBA's will find useful information. I don't know what I would do without this book. It showed me some of the techniques that I use regularly, such as the CASE statement."
5,You couldn't find a better book to spend your money on,"I bought this because of all the good reviews and I have to say: I'm not disappointed.This book has changed the way I write Transact-SQL. It has also educated me about SQL Server. Who knew you could do all that stuff with Transact-SQL? Medians? Sliding aggregates? Regions? Runs? Sequences? Trees? Each time I come across a new trick in this book, I think: ""What will this guy come up with next?!"" The book is jampacked with advanced techniques and code that I've not seen anywhere else.You couldn't find a better book to spend your money on. If you want the one book that can teach you to code the way the gurus do, get this one."
5,Just what I needed,I've been looking for a book like this for about five years. I wanted something that went beyond the Microsoft documentation. Something that told me all the little details they usually left out. Well I finally found it. This book gives it all. Its loaded with good examples. It doesn't just tell you how to do something. It shows you. I couldn't believe you could do all the stuff you can do with just Transact SQL. I guess it comes down to knowing what your doing. One more thing: I learned more from the tuning chapter than I have in some whole books on the subject. It was great. This is the best SQL book around.
2,You need it only if you are already a guru,This book is written for people who are already not only familiar with t-sql but they are guru. But if you are a guru you don't need it.If you are not a guru you will never understand the most of the book. It is useless at all.
1,Out of Date,"After all the ballyhoo on this book, I went and bought it. Frankly, I'm disappointed. Were there pages missing or did old Ken forget about triggers? With SQL Server 2000 on the street much of what you see here is old hat. Current books cover SQL 2000. This one doesn't. For a guy that's barely heard from in the newsgroups, the self-important style is inappropriate. Go and earn your keep, Ken."
5,A Good Book for all T-SQL Programmers.,"The author writes in a very refined style, making it easy for anyone to grasp the concepts. Even though the book is intended for people with prior programming experience, the author makes it easy for novice and student programmers to follow. I read it even on a plane and it was just like cruising through a novel.I highly recommend this book."
2,Too many code errors,"Bought Ken Henderson's Guru's Guide to T-SQL, hoping to build on my (very) basic skills as a beginning developer. Looked very promising and I was really looking forward to working through it using the code in the book and on the enclosed CD. However, there is no cross-reference in the book to which files go with which code samples, resulting in a lot of hunting around to find the right files. And then, quite a few of the code samples simply won't run. Even with the corrections referred to in the Errata section on his website, I got many more errors than I can fix. Between trying to find the correct sql files from the cd, and trying to fix the errors, I've pretty much abandoned the book altogether. Not much use trying to learn from bad code. Wouldn't spend the money on this one, if I had to do it over."
3,Little Disappointing,"I could not find the basic Replace string function, which is very essential to do a find-and-replace in a select statement. Also, the font is size is small and irritating to read.May be this book is better, because lot many others may be worse.I will give a 2.5"
5,Get if you want to master Transact-Sql,This book was my lifeline when I moved from Informix to Sql 2k. My shop recently moved all of our applications (about 15) from Informix to Sql 2k. We could not have done it without this book.It builds on what you can find in the product documentation and teaches the many things you have to know to use Transact-Sql in real production systems. The product docs don't tell even half the story so a book like this is indespensible.We bought 20 copies of this book when we first began researching our migration. Now that we're through we're adding some more team members so I am buying five more copies this afternoon. I would hate to think where our migration would have ended up without this great book.
5,A wonderful book,"I like this book because it's honest. The author is obviously more than just a DBA -- he's obviously a software craftsman in his own right.This book combines a very deep knowledge of SQL Server and Transact-SQL with best practices and sound software engineering techniques to produce the best database book I've seen in a very long time.The problem with most developers learning SQL is that they tend to approach it using a 3GL mindset. The problem with most DBAs is that they tend to not be very good software developers. Mr. Henderson is obviously a skilled developer as well as an expert DBA, and his book shows that. Highly recommended."
3,For Tweakers Only,"If you're a full-time SQL programmer, this book will provide value. It delves into esoteric topics. From a practical standpoint, the book does not show the uses of SQL in a meaningful way. Don't buy it unless you're full-time."
3,Outdated,"The downside to this book is that it is from 2000, and the code snippets are no longer available online. Also, since this book was written, there is a new Microsoft SQL Server product called 2005, that this book doesn't talk about obviously.I don't recommend this book, because I really only got a few tips out of it. It's not suited well for a beginner or advanced user. It just kind of covers the whole range. And it's time to move on to books that use the latest software."
5,The best there is,This book is so chalk full of stuff not found in other books I don't know where to begin. Every chapter has insights that could be books unto themselves. Take the Undocumented chapter for example. It could be its own book. Or the Cursors chapter. Or the Transactions chapter. Or Fulltext. Over and over this book delivers like no other. Definitely what it claims to be: a guru's guide to Transact-Sql.
5,The first T-SQL book I turn to,"I'm a consultant working with SQL Server for several years now and I'm using T-SQL more and more each day.This book is THE FIRST and usually ONLY T-SQL book I reach for when I have a T-SQL question or need a solution. I also own ""Transact-SQL Programming"" from O-Reilly (ISBN 1565924010), but unfortunately it reads much more like a plain textbook. I really enjoy Henderson's writing style - it's very easy to read for a technical book and one of the few that I can just pickup and read anytime without falling alseep to gleem information from several of the more interesting chapters. There is not a lot of ""fluff"" added to enlarge the size of the book - the author gets right to the point.As a previous reviewer stated, ""I began moving to the next level almost immediately."" If you buy just one T-SQL reference book, this should be it."
3,Great for Already-Proficient SQL Programmers,"Excellent resource for experienced T-SQL programmers to identify lot's of elegant code and good explanations. Those of you who already understand SQL and RDBMS basic, but need to gain some initial skills with Programming SQL Server 2000 and T-SQL will get a lot out of ""SQL Server 2000 Programming By Example"" by Guerrero and Rojas, an excellent, although not completely sufficient prep for Microsoft's SQL Server Design exam. Those of you who are intermediate T-SQL types will get tons out of Bob Vieira's excellent ""SQL Server 2000 Programming"" which goes nicely beyond certification-level content into DTS, OLAP and other key areas. Why only three stars? The book does not clearly warn the purchaser of it's required skill level, er... except in it's name, of course..."
4,Good Buy!,This is a well written book that has covered virtually every area I've needed. It is my number one reference book for transact SQL.
2,Outdated and for earlier versions,"This is old version 7.0 material.It's all command line driven ideas and magazine level tricks for using a query language like a real programming language, only it doesn't fly in production.This book is for novices only. Any enterprise programmer would want to steer clear of this inaptly named book.I give it two stars for the sharpening of t-sql query writing.One can get caught up in real programming many times and miss the forest for the trees. This book does at least show times a query might work as well as real code.2 stars."
5,Just the book I wanted,"This was written for SQL Server 2000. I have been working with SQL Server for over 10 years. This book is filled with handy, clear, interesting SQL code. I have found several techniques that I use every day. I enjoy the style and the absence of screen shots of the query editor.Mr. Henderson explains clearly why the code is written and when you would write the SQL statements.I recommend this book for anyone with some experience in SQL and some frustration with SQL Server."
2,A Disappointment,"After reading the rave reviews, I was disappointed with the book. In initially KH has a go at books that fill their pages with screen shots. However half the book is filled with ugly Courier code slabs of not only repetitive code but also repetitive result sets. Notwithstanding that some of the code is useful to browse, it is usually pretty ordinary to someone like me who has been writing T-SQL for 10 years. Also some of it is just showmanship as KH often admits that there are better and more efficient ways of getting the required result (either with code or tools). I ended up reading the book in a few hours and then putting it on the shelf where it will probably now collect dust which is unfortunate after laying out US$50 after postage."
5,A great SQL Server Scripting Text & Reference,"I have used this book as a reference on projects involving SQL Server Scripting and it is among the best. It is very readable and clear and presents its examples well. I consider this text and Murach Publishing's SQL Server 2008 for Developers to be the two best in the field for SQL Server. If you have both, you might just have all you need as references for non-.NET SQL Server Scripting."
5,VERY WELL WRITTEN,I have been programming since 1966 but am new to sql. I alreadyhad a stack of references on sql that all assumed you knew sqlalready.Henderson's book begins with an excellent chapter that laysthe foundation to understand how sql works. The examples areshort and spectacular. Now I am starting to get something outof all those other books...
5,GREAT BOOK!!!,"600 code samples? What does that tell you? It tells you that the book is what it says it is: a coder's book. If you want to learn to code in Transact-SQL, this is this book for you. It doesn't waste paper or trees by cataloging what the Books Online already tells you. It tells you what the BOL leaves out and takes you beyond just learning syntax to solving real world problems. The book is really a cookbook of solutions to hard Transact-SQL problems. Not only is it a great SQL Server book, it is one of the best solutions books ever written."
4,D80,It feels great in your hands. I had the D50 and I think this doesn't focus as fast when using the same lens. I sold my D50 so I don't have a direct comparison but it seems like more of an issue with moving subjects than the D50. Maybe I was just expecting pure greatness.
5,Classic Ska,"This is a must have for any fan of classic Ska, I listen to this recording often and it hasn't gotten old."
2,It teach me anything,"I work with children, and may be I know a lot of things. But it didn't help me with my work."
2,"Neat little device, terrible internal battery","The interface is great. The clickable unit face is great. The battery life ruins the product. The battery loses charge even when the unit is not in use, and loses it quickly. This player is dead within a week without even being turned on. If it is on it lasts about six hours. Horrid battery life. Good little player besides that. Deal breaker though, in my opinion."
5,A pre-Tom Clancy techno-thriller,"Before Tom Clancy there was John Ball. Foundby accident, top-notch thriller tells howthe Soviet Union (in the old days) takes overthe United States without firing a shot.Team is assembled by former president to tryand take country back. Main character is aninterpreter who works in White House and isrecruited by FIRST TEAM to help take back thecountry from the Soviets, and the Russianfactory manager who is chosen to run the USfrom the White House. Spy, counterspy, anda stolen nuclear missile submarine, its allhere. Clancy could have used this one for aguide to what he writes. Excellent!"
5,I recommend ...,"If you enjoyed The First Team, you will surely also enjoy Taylor Caldwell's The Devil's Advocate. It's another good story about an American underground/resistance movement, in America, after a take-over by a hostile government."
5,Best (and last) Big Country studio album,"The original release of this album was only released overseas and was titled' Driving to Damascus'.This is a remixed version of that album with 4 extra b-sides released only in the US.This unfortunately was to be Big Country's last studio album before lead singer/songwriter Stuart Adamson's death.It's my favorite and possibly most well-rounded album they ever made. It's got the standard, driving Big Country anthems in 'Driving to Damascus', accessible catchy pop songs in 'Somebody Else' and 'See You', and deepnew-age mysticism in 'Your Spirit to me'.Not only are all the other tracks memorable, they also contain one of BC's enduring songs, 'Fragile Thing',a very well written bittersweet classic.But that's not it! You will also get four reallllly good b-side tracks that deserved to be on the album. ' This Blood's for you' and 'John Wayne's Dream' could have been singles.This is a great album."
4,Not bad...,"At $13 I had to at least give it a shot. At $13 I'm not disappointed. You could probably get me to pay $25 if it came down to it.Other reviews complained about the instructions, but for a z-wave device they weren't that bad compared to other z-wave items. I've seen worse. The more you play with z-wave in general the easier it gets.I dropped my review to 4 stars simply since the remote is a little bulky and not as small as I think they may have been able to make it. It also lags a little bit on sending commands. It takes about a second to activate the commands to the switches unlike my Harmony 890 which sends its commands instantly.We bought two to use in our vehicles as we leave and return to control our yard light, porch light & foyer lights. They serve their purpose well."
2,Works inconsistently,"The ""ON"" function does not work consistently when operating the control inside the house to an outside module.Would not recommend this item for purchase if you plan to operate the control in this manner."

5,Thank You,"""Your Tears"" my favorite of the whole cd. The CD is an uplifting, spiritual connection from God to You."
1,Careful,"I live in Florida USA.When I received the DVDs I exitedly opened one and it did not work....when I called I was told it only worked in Egypt, Germany and more European places....Why would I want it here? There was no warning on the DVD, it just said for Region 2...who was I to know what that meant? When I tried to return it, I was told there was no refund if it was opened. Amazon graciously refunded two of the DVD's and instructed me to return ALL the DVD's to Herman. After 3 years of fighting, they have not refunded the money as promised after Amazon intervened, stating they had sent a check!This kept me from going back to Amazon..until recently: for a toilet seat. Made in the USA."
3,Human Doll Express,"I first heard this band on a fashion show clip I saw on the internet for some reason; their songs were mixed in with Bow Wow Wow tunes. Strangely given the genre and chronological disparity, the two bands' sounds fit very well together. Their rough pop sound caught my attention and I bought this, their second album.I don't listen to it reguarly, though. The few standout tracks, Anywhere But Here, Teenage Zombie Knockout, and Human Doll Express are worth adding to your iPod, but the rest of the disc is more or less filler."
1,Poo Poo,"Posing rock and roll from the ""fashion"" capital of the world,Seattle, Wa. If these guys spent as much time practicing asthey did ""thrift shopping"" they would be sub-par.There own drummer wrote a five star review.Should be filed under ""fashion punk.""Someone is married to Billy Childish in this band. No wonder theyhave connections..."
3,needs a little work,"I bought the ""new style"" skimmer. Makes alot of bubbles for the proteins to stick to, the bigger and better collection cup is bigger and better, But the skimmer wouldn't turn down enough to stop a constant flow of micro bubbles into the collection cup. I let it run for 3 days, routing the flow through the optional drain tube back into my sump while I awaited Coralife Techs to return my email...I'm still waiting. I resolved the problem by placing a ball valve between the pump and skimmer intake, slowing the water flow slightly, and now it works great! The pump seems to be just a little too powerful for the return flow design."
1,Bad/sad story on how you go from grief to horrendous policy,"This book is an embarrassment. Badly written, badly conceived. A sad, incomplete, and partial account of the tragic slippage from personal grief to the collective tragedy of a policy that does nothing but aggravate the problem it is supposed to solve. Relies on emotion, not on argument. Pitiful."
