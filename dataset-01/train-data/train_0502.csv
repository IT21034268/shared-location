4,Maniac Magee,Good selection for 10-14 year olds. Provokes discussions on orphans- prejudism-segregation and homelessness. Keeps the adolescent reader interested.
5,Maniac Magee,"This book is about a boy that his parent's died,and had to go live with his uncle and aunt.Maniac,that's what his uncle and aunt aunt called him,maniac thaugh they were really weird.He thaugh that because they were married and they did not like to share thing's.Like they both had there own tv,toaster,and bed's,maniac thaugh that was pretty weird.Then maniac got board of being in the house so he took a walk in the park and he saw a girl and she was carring some book's and she droped one.Maniac ran toward the book and picked it up and returned it to the girl,that's how maniac met the girl named Amanda."
1,Maniac Magee,"I thought this book was so-so.Maniacs parents died in a trolly falling into a river and drowning.After he lives with his aunt dot and uncle dan.They hate sharing they will fight over anything they even fight over Maniac.Finally Maniac runs away and finds new friends .He meets alot of real nice,kind,caring and helpful people along the way.Maniac meets grayson he helps grayson and grayson will teach Maniac some baseball.This book made me think of what it would be like with no parents.It also made me think what it would be like to run away and it made me yhink if I have any true friends."
1,maniac magee,"I thought the book was boring. Maniac's parents died in a P and W trolley falling off a bridge because the driver was drunk.After Maniac heard the news,he stayed with his aunt and uncle.He ran away because his aunt and uncle annoyed him because they had seperate things and they never talk to each other.As he ran, he spoted the ball park.At the end,he realizes that life is not a game.This book made me think about running from problems."
3,Maniac Magee Book Review,"Maniac Magee was a very realistic and touching story. The only way that you can tell is if you find your self being mad or feeling sad for a character-- Jerry Spinelli has sucked you into the book. He uses informal and informal language. Details as I mentioned before, were very realistic. Some of the events in the book, you can relate to in your everyday life. Parts of this book are confusing,but that's the way Spinelli writes."
3,My Review for Maniac Magee,"I have to admit that this book, Maniac Magee was not my favorite. I found it very confusing in a lot of parts. Now.... Like I said, this was not my favorite, but I did not hate it. Jerry Spinelli really knows how to pull you in, and throw you off. I thought that Spinelli worded his sentences in a fabulous way! I would have liked Maniac Magee better if things were explained more. I thought that in some parts Maniac was a very tough and strong person, and then in other parts he wasn't. I hope to read more of Jerry Spinelli's books, and see if he changes his style."
3,Jeffery to Maniac,"I thought the book was ok. It was not what I thought it would be. Jerry Spinelli is an ok writer but I think that Maniac Magee was the worst book Spinelli wrote.The book is about a boy named Maniac (it was Jeffrey but he was re-born )Magee. He moves in with is aunt and uncle (Dot and Dan). During a Musicale at his school, he was re-born. They call it the birth scearm. Maniac ran out of the auditorium. He ends up in a east end black area where only black live. Jerry Spinelli likes to throw you off and bring you back in fast (like a fly away ball )If you like those kinds of books read Maniac Magee."
4,Maniac Magee,I enjoyed Maniac Magee but it was too sad for my taste. I liked the end because he wound up living with the family he liked the most. The reason why I think the story was kind of sad is because at the start of the story Maniac's parents died in a trolley accident. It was also kind of stupid because Maniac could have stayed with the Beales but he didn't.In conclusion I would recomend this book to somone my age.
3,A RACE TO THE FINISH,"Maniac Magee was an interesting book, that i enjoyedreading. there were a good variety of characters, for example MarsBars and Piper McNab. at first they didnt like people of a differentrace, but toward the end, they did'nt mind as much. if you took anycombination of characters and compared them, you would find atleastone similarity and one difference. another thing i liked about thebook is that if you ever got board or didnt like a certainstoryline,it would soon change. Maniac was always moving. Forinstance, if you didn't like Grayson or the band shell, Maniac soonmoved ...One thing i didnt like about the book was that it wasconfusing. The setting, charactors, and emotions kept changing. Thatmade the story hard to follow and understand at certian times. Thevariations of personalities, characters, and storylines made ManiacMagee such an enjoyable book."
3,Maniac Magee,"The novel Maniac Magee was definitely not a great book.I didn't really like the book at all.I really didn't like it because it wasn't that exciting to me.They really didn't describe the familys to great.It made me confused by having too many families in it.It also was very hard to keep up with all the families and which family he was with,that is also why it made me confused.There is one more reason why I really didn't like the book.They would say a good part than leave it to the end of the story.These are my examples of not liking the book at all.I really didn't like the book at all."
1,The book Maniac Magee,"The book Maniac Magee was not really good. I thought that the book was choppy. When Maniac ran around everywhere. It really didn't nention what happen in between when he was running. One mintute he was talking to Amanda and the next he was at the high school fieds, and caught a football. Then when he left the Beales it was weird because I thought he liked the Beales. that was also a good thing because then he meets Grayson, but Grayson dies. I thought that was sad because it was five days after Christmas. The only part that I liked was at the end, because MarsBar meets the Pickwells and the McNabs. So my overall opion on this book was that it wasn't really good."
1,Maniac Magee,I liked the book a lot.I liked how Jerry Spinelli was very desriptive and how he used the character to exspress diffrent fellings.Maniac Magee went through diffrent conflics and solves them.I thought that Amanda was very kind to Maniac and took him into her home.I liked how Maniac thought that there should not be barriers between black and white people.Grayson is a ne guy. I did not like that when Maniac has a home at Amanda's house but then runs.
1,B.O.R.I.N.G,"I did not like this book at all.The book was boring& too predictable.I really didnt like Spinneli's writing.He got into too many details.I did not like the plot of this story.That he was a poor orphan kid.I would not recommend this book to other people.I dont know about any of his other books but this one was terrible.That includes my reveiw of the very, very, boring book of Maniac Magee"
2,10 year- old reader,"I read this book when I was in fourth grade. It didn't make any sense. I don't suggest it. It was kind of good, but one thing happened after the other. It was way too confusing for my age readers!!"
4,Maniac Magee,"Jeffrey Lionel Magee was an ordinary child till he was three. When the P and W high-speed trolley took its famous crash, and just like that Jeffrey Magee was an orphan. I would recommend this book to any person how likes suspense and action. I liked this book so mush I could read it again. When Russell was hanging on for dear life and Piper was screaming off his that was there to save them. When maniac was dared to go to East End black people territory, something amazing happened. Read this book to see what happens."
4,Maniac Magee Book Review By: Emily Roth,"I would give maniac magee a 4 out of 5 stars because it's humorous, interesting, and even has some sad parts. Maniac was an orphan because his parents died in an accident. He changes his name and becomes a drifter. He runs around towns and meets some really interesting people on the way. He becomes a local hero to many but not all. Overall, this book is a 4 star book. I would recommend it to any one who enjoy's any of Jerry Spinelli's novel's."
5,Maniac Magee,"I am using this book with my students. They seem to enjoy the book, and enjoy discussing Jeffery (Maniac). I feel that the characters are well developed which in turn brings out the problems with the two sides of the new town. We read a book dealing with prejudious and racism last year. Therefore, I felt using a book that was in the same vein, but taking a different tatic on the subject would also be good. I like a book that keeps the students interest. Also it makes it good for comprehension, and it will lead to some writing assignments as well."
4,Enjoyable story,"What comes to your mind when I say the word ""maniac?"" You may think of someone crazy running around wildly, right? Well, Maniac Magee, this is wrong. Maniac is the main character, and he runs away when his aunt and uncle are fighting. It is an enjoyable story, but like most really good stories way too short."
4,"Jeffery Lionel ""Maniac"" Magee","I would definitely recommend this book to both boys and girls of any age. This book doesn't have any violence or anything cruel (except a little boy practically dying of starvation and no home). This book would always leave you wondering what would happen next so it's nearly impossible to put down. This book also has morale, which is, be happy with what you have."
5,great book,"All of Jerry Spinelli's books are great, this one however is great. I loved how Maniac was able to see people as people, not color, age, or sex. For a boy who has no one he is able to have a positive outlook on life. This is a book that all children from the ages of 8-12 should read."
4,Maniac Magee,"Maniac Magee is a book about a boy who has lost his parents in a car accident. He leaves his hometown to live in a neighboring town that is split, half black half white. He finds a really good baseball player that strikes out everyone, except Maniac. This results in Maniac getting chased around town. He befriends a black girl and eventually ends up living with this family. The town bad mouths this family because they have a white kid living with them. Maniac leaves there and goes to the white side of the neighborhood. Maniac meets a famous baseball player that lives at the YMCA. He eventually lets Maniac move in with him. He shows him all his baseball techniques and gives him his favorite baseball glove.You'll have to read the book to find out what happens next.I really liked the book because it was well written and there are a lot of things a teenager can relate to."
5,Maniac Magee- a Kid Who Cares,"The story is mainly about a kid who runs away and ends up in a family who cares about him. The story shows love, caring, and sadness. I like the book because it is so sad. The author shows how people can care about others."
3,The so-so book,"I think Maniac Magee was a so and so novel. It was a really touching story. One example is when Mrs. Beale slapped him in the face and he said I love you. He also finds alot of familys that take him in. One person that helped him a lot was Grayson. There were a few problems too. It had little bad language. I rather not give a example of the bad language. It had hard vocabulary. If you were my age you would need a dictionary to read the book with out any problems. It had words like endure, zany, and chaotic.Thats why i think Mainac is a okay book"
1,Don't Buy!,"This book needs updating! Most of the Programs/Applications used has been updated once and probably twice. But if you're still in the IE 3.0 era, this book is probably very good."
2,Gorilla Theatre,"This film may have seemed cutting edge at the time of it's release in 1966;now it just seems terribly dated. Essentially the story involves a neurotic Londoner (David Warner) with a fixation on amphibians and Marxist politics who is attempting to reconcile with his ex-wife(Vanessa Redgrave). As far as I'm concerned, Warner's character is so loony that you can see why his wife left him. We're supposed to find his antics endearing;I just found them incredibly annoying. Redgrave received an Oscar nomination for her efforts here and rightly so. She almost convinces us that she felt some affection and may still harbor a little for this offputting madman."
3,Another title to the NFS line up,Granted most people won't like this game because they don't like how it feels. There is a learning curve that most people have had and are having problems with. Once you figure out the games little quarks on how it works it's not bad at all. It's hard to push the cars on the easyest setting because it has auto brakes and more times than not it ends up with you losing control and end up in the dirt.Once you get farther into the games and have the diffrent cars and upgrades it becomes fun. But it will take time to get there. Your not given the best car right off the bat you have to really work at it to get there.But with any game try to rent it and play to see if this is something you really want to spend 60 bucks on.
2,Lame.....,Very lame game compared with other quality racing games. Don't waste your time. PGR is much more fun as is Forza.
2,"What is with the ""YO YO YO HOMIE""?","Simply put I do not enjoy playing this game and it is now collecting dust. The ""DJ"" at the racedays, with his ""YO YO HOMIE"" would be laughable if it wasn't so irritating. Drag racing? Why? News flash! A drag racing video game is boring....It is probably a hoot in real life but to hit the gas and drive straight is, well, lame. But it is part of the game for some reason. I have tried to like this game but its so hard. The cars slide off the road at 30mph. I know you start with a basic car but a 1975 VW bus handles better. Rent it, maybe you will like it. But please do not buy it without trying it."
3,NFS PS,"It's a very cool game, the roads and events are very good designed. The textures and graphics are too. but when I play, the introduction repeat and repeat the same frame, It's bored sometimes."
3,wish had more cars,The game has good grafics but it wasnt what i expected so if you buy it is on you maybe you will like it
1,HOLD UP!!! DONT CHECK OUT,"this game suuuuuuucked what happened carbon was great and most wanted was awsome this game sucked really really bad. listen all im saying is good thing I rented it for 8$ and didnt spend 60 like ervyone else, remember you can't return it after you open it so listen to me. don't get this."
4,drag racing is pretty sweet,good game but i miss the complete customization with ricing cars out haha you can still customize cars dont get me wrong but not like nfs underground. fun game but I like the drag racing the best in the game to be honest the other aspects are slightly mediocre
2,Dull game,"I played it for a week and got bored. There are not many variations in the game play, just the basic 4 types of tracks and it sometimes becomes to difficult to complete a level when people upload unrealistic stats."
2,Just plain lame.,"NFS: Underground 2 was a pretty fun game. Yes, the riceboi take on it was weak, but all in all it was some good, goofy fun. NFS: Carbon which followed was something of a disappointment, though not exactly bad. But Pro Street was crap.The storyline was weak to the point of being nonexistent, the racing was awkward much of the time, the selection of cars was shamefully small, and the rules for what cars could participate in what events was, frankly, nonsensical.If you want a proper racing game for the 360, get Forza Motorsport 2. It lacks a storyline (which is actually less of an insult than Pro Street's vestigial story), but has dozens of tracks, hundreds of cars, and just takes itself a lot more seriously."
4,Great simulator,"This game is a great racing simulator. Not really true to the Need For Speed line -- no cops or no running away, just racing. However, it does the racing fantastically. From optional racing assists to a clutch button (which is very helpful, if not difficult to master), this game is only outdone by Gran Turismo or Forza Motorsport as far as realism is concerned. Amazing graphics!Not recommended for arcade style players!"
2,Not what I was used to.,The only need for speed game I ever played was where I would was an undercover cop. I had to race illegally and had to run away from cops as well.This was closer to gran turismo with a tiny story line.If you're expecting this game to be like Need for Speed: Most Wanted then don't get it.
5,HARD SHELL COMPUTER SLEEVE,"I LOVED THE PRODUCT BUT WHEN I RECEIVED IT I FOUND MY 15"" MACBOOK PRO TITANIUM LAPTOP DIDN'T FIT INTO THE SLEEVE. I DON'T THINK THIS PARTICULAR CASE WAS MADE FOR THE NEW TITANIUM LAPTOP WHICH APPEARS TO BE JUST A LITTLE WIDER THAN THE PREVIOUS MODELS. JUST MAKE SURE WHEN YOU PURCHASE THIS ITEM THAT YOU INQUIRE WHETHER YOUR LAPTOP WILL FIT INTO IT. EVERYTHING ELSE ASIDE. I LOVED THE PRODUCT. THIS IS THE ONLY CASE THAT DOESN;T HAVE A ZIPPER OR VELCRO. IT'S EASY TO JUST REACH IN AND PULL YOUR LAPTOP OUR AND IT IS A HARD SHELL VERY ATTRACTIVE SLEEVE BUT THE PROBLEM I HAD WAS THAT MY COMPUTER DIDN'T FIT IT."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I ordered this same product. As in the previous review, the same thing happens...the display only shows ""partial numbers""...and I tried 3 new sets of batteries. This product by Mabis is a piece of garbage. Do NOT buy this; you will be disappointed. I thought maybe it was just one defective unit until I read the previous review and saw that that person had the same problems I had with it. Do not buy this thing."
5,Great insight,"Husband wanted this version after hearing MacArthur speak at Moody Bible Institute. It is a wonderfull item to have, you get wonderful insights in small portions. The ideas he presents in the study notes are well and prayerfully thought through."
4,Great Study Bible but hard to use in Kindle,Shifting between different books of the bible and finding a specific verse is slow.I couldn't guess how it could be made easier on the Kindle.I sure weighs less than the printed book and is easy to readI'd do it again.
1,Bible Filled with Bias and Anti Pentecostal Views,"This bible is full of bias and misleads believers making them feel that they have no authority over demons. It denies the fact that Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever. MacArthurs commentary denies the power of the blood of Jesus. He is blatent about his belief that the gifts of the Spirit are not for today. This bible is very misleading and is a way of MacArthur to further propogate that Christians are powerless over the enemy and are expected to be downtrodden and not live in true victory."
5,My Bible,I love that I can tuck my Bible into my purse and carry it with me everywhere I go. I love love love it.
2,Kindle edition appears to be lacking (iPad ),"I just returned the kindle edition as the links (dagger) linked to online English dictionary and not John macarthurs excellent footnotes. In fact, after much poking around, I only found his book introductions, maps, etc. the commentary is just not there. (At least I could not access it). The sample of the kindle esv appears to be intact and working."
5,Fantastic,"Commentary and maps help interpret God's Word. I recommend a Greek Interlinear Bible if you want to dig in deeper.Overall, this is the perfect study Bible for new believers as well as anybody else trying to study God's Word."
5,I Love this Study Bible,I have enjoyed listening to John MacArthur's radio broadcasts for the past 20 or so years and so I was already familiar with the MacArthur name. And I really enjoy the NASB version of the Bible and so when I heard about this study Bible decided to buy a copy of it. My church bookstore does have this item available so could have purchased it there but decided to order through Amazon & I'm glad I did. Its easy for me to follow along and the footnotes are good too.
5,Great reference book,"This Bible is quite possibly the best reference/study Bible I have encountered...I am a big fan of McArthur, and in this commentary I enjoy his insight and especially his lack of opinion in most cases. He primarily states fact and cross-references it to other scripture. I would recommend this to anyone who is young in the faith like myself and wants some guidance to the scripture while you read. Highly recommended!"
4,Good Study Bible,"Very good study Bible. McCarthur is very diligent in studying the Bible and all types of resources surrounding it such as history, Greek, Hebrew, other Christian works, secular works, etc. Not a big fan of NASB or NKJV of the Bible, though many prefer them. In some cases the reading is more difficult. For example (NASB then KJV) magi-wise men, dissipation-riot, sordid-filthy, diadems-crowns. Obviously there are examples where the opposite is true also. Another place to look at some NASB changes is hissheep.org. A good, understandable KJV non-study Bible is the Defined King James Bible by Bibles for Today. Hardcovers are reasonably priced. Anyway the McCarthur Bible is a good and informative study Bible."
4,Good Study Bible,"The Bible itself is good, easy to read, the only two things I believe should be fixed are to make it easier to navigate from one passage to another book chapter verse somewhere else. This one is a little cumbersome. The only other thing that would be nice, would be to allow the users to link verses together. We can highlight verses, and put notes on them, but it would be a nice feature to be able to set up say 10 verses for a study and link them together to facilitate quick navigation through them."
4,pedestrian sheen,"Master musicians/studio wizards, moe., pollish yet another batch of, otherwise pedestrian, songs, to a bright sheen. They're playing this pop/rock game on their own terms, every note is well placed. I wonder how long this took to put together, I'm thinking years not weeks."
3,"It's ""okay...alright""","I've only listened to this once and thought it's ok, y'know, alright. I mean, I listened to Wormwood once and thought the same thing and then a few months later played it again and thought, ""WOW""!, so perhaps the Conch will grow on me as well. For a moe. album, I agree with the other reviewer that states it's indeed a follow-up to Wormwood. Worth a listen, but I've heard moe. do better"
2,not the usual Moe,"This CD is basic music, nothing special. The lyrics are normal and there are no long jam sessions."
1,"all fluff, to cute, no balls","I like these guys alot.I own a bunch of there stuff and love to see them live whenever I get the chance.I played this Cd a few times liked it at first, but it didn't grow on me at all liked I'd hoped.To cute for me,not spontaneous enough.I feel this cd will become just another dust collector in a short period of time. The band should just let it rip.That's what they do best.This Cd is to well thought out and sounds to well thought out. In a bad way, not a good way. A jam band should think from the heart and very little from the head because the heart knows best."
5,"""A MUST SEE FILM""","A classic semi-horror film with no gore or blood, just a good old plot! Set in 1900 six people vanish without a trace,while having a picnic at hanging rock!"
4,A lovely romantic unconventionnal comedy,"Lovely story smartly played by Lanoux and Barreau. The couple takes us on the road of their love story and the difficult and unconventionnal choices they make are, at the same time, a delight and a source of reflexion. Enchanting. Good part for Marchand."
1,cannot rate what I cannot see,"Unfortunately, this came in a format that cannot be played on U.S. equipment. I am trying to get it converted as it is an all time favoite. I don't recall this being disclosed when I purchased the DVD.Pat"
3,Gallic bonbon,"More a Hollywood film spoken in French than something you might find from Eric Rohmer or Truffaut. An affair between cousins (related by marriage) wreaks havoc with the ""other"" spouses, each of whom has some ""issues"" the filmmakers use as light comedy. The so so laughs emerge as absurd and morbid comments from oddball family members, though many fall flat.The two leads really do have remarkable on screen chemistry, the main thing going for this film, but this slight and shallow film doesn't ring the least bit true to life. Frankly, I was a little horrified to see the filmmakers show the children smiling gleefully (Hollywood happy ending) as the leads run off with one each other on Christmas Day - when was the last time you saw children handing separation and divorce that way? Far imperfect, but it has its charms. A better script might have made for a bitter-sweet classic."
3,chick flick in French,"A silly mid-life love affair turns into the real thing:with bells and whistles.The movie is well acted, but slow;sometimes funny in a sort of disfunctional family sort of way.I liked it, but it tended to put me to sleep."
3,Disappointed,"I always look forward to reading Nancy Taylor Rosenberg's new books (I've read them all) because I know I'm going to enjoy it. But I can honestly say I was disappointed this time. For some reason the book didn't keep me thinking about the story line. So much so I would want to get back to reading as soon as possible. Usually her books are pages turners and I enjoy the characters in the story. Didn't work for me this time though. This was my first disappiontment, but I still like forward to her next book."
3,"Not as Charmed as one would hope, but still a good read.","Like many, I really enjoyed Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings as they were well-written stories with wit, drama, and charm.I could relate to the Jessica and was rooting for her and Marcus. I enjoyed Charmed Thirds, not so much for the story but because it was another peak in the life of a character I liked so much.It was a good, entertaining read; however, a lot of information was left out. Considering the journals are supposed to document 4 years, 400 pages isn't really alot.Nevertheless, if you can get past the lack of character development, and some repetative elements (how often can we hear that Scotty is a meathead?) it's still a well-written story with wit, drama, and charm - especially for long-time Jess Darling fans, like myself."
3,Fast forwarding through college,My main problem with this book is that it focused on the breaks during Jess's college career so that it went through a great amount of time in a short book without being in depth with many of the new characters. Jess seems to have become a stagnant character who is waiting to be with Marcus and biding her time with other people because she is confused.
1,Disappointing,"I loved Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings. I hated Charmed Thirds.This book failed. It failed to move me. It failed to say anything new. It failed to develop new characters, the author simply ""threw in"" characters from the first two books for no reason. It all seemed contrived. She almost seemed to be trying to just ""placate/please the fans.""Like other reviewers have said: too much of the author's personal negative feelings came out-about politics and family. Too the point where I just said: ""Wow. If you wanted to write a book about your views on the government, why didn't you just write one.""The whole book was sad, vulgar, abrasive, contrived, and was a downright waste of my time.THE FIRST TWO BOOKS ARE SIMPLY WONDERFUL/A JOY TO READ. STICK TO THOSE AND DON'T BUY CHARMED THIRDS UNTIL YOU'VE READ THIS GOD-AWEFUL MESS."
1,Don't let your daughter read this!!!,"A trashy novel that teaches young girls to have low standards and be promiscuous. Such books are lauded as being true and realistic, and while I don't doubt that it is an accurate account of the sadly low standards of people of college age, the consequences and long-term effects of reckless choices are not accurately portrayed.I discovered my daughter had borrowed this book--from a friend who is entering 9th grade and is expecting a child. No surprise there, thanks to Megan and similar authors, girls are being taught to disrespect themselves at a young age and further the unwed teenage pregnancy problem in this country. Consider my rating zero stars for absolutely no redeeming value."
1,Un-Charmed Thirds,"I must say that I loved loved loved the first 2 books and loved Jessica (including all her faults.) We waited forever for this third book, and now I feel like the author should not have even bothered with this one. I agree with one of the earlier reviews...this one totally ""jumped the shark."" Very disappointing! I was also turned off by the unneccessary vulgar language. It seemed like the author just threw it in for no real purpose except shock value. I guess I just don't like hearing one of my favorite characters talking about how she wants to f*&$ her boyfriend."
2,Not so charmed with Charmed Thirds,I absolutely loved the first two books in the series and eagerly awaited the next in the series. I ended up very disappointed. I agree with all the other reviews that give Charmed Thirds a low rating so I will not repeat all of their stuff. Just be warned that you might end up skimming pages at a time because things get boring and I'm not even sure I like Jessica anymore. I didn't laugh or get excited by anything in the book and I was mostly angry at her choices and disappointed in the whole tone of this book. I kind of wish the book had been about Bridget and Pepe instead...
4,Jessica Darling Grows Up,"This novel was almost underwhelming for all of the anticipation leading up to its release. It is a quieter experience, far more personal, and ultimately more rewarding because it takes you on the road not often taken in YA literature. There is far less squeeing and a helluva lot more reality. More gray, less black and white.I loved this book. Perhaps it's because I'm on the other side of all of that - I'm nearing thirty and facing the rest of my life, with the bigger uncertainties behind me. I like that Jessica is no less self-aware but she is also becoming remarkably self-possessed. And - dare I say it? HAPPY. Not because of a boy (or rather, the boy), but because she is CHOOSING happiness.Then you have the ending. I loved how much it felt like a beginning as well, since most endings are. And then there's the postcard. I loved that postcard, and I can't wait for book four."
5,"Darling, Jessica...Keeps getting better with age!","I won't be wordy or lengthy with my review. Megan Mccafferty just keeps getting better with each book. Keep up the good fight and I look forward to reading about Jess, Hope, Marcus, Bridget, Pepe, Marian, Bethany, G-Money..and the rest of gang for years to come."
1,Keep Your Daughters Away,"J. Darling is not a peer that you want your daughter to model her behavior after. Jessica's decision to lose her virginity to sexual player and drug user Marcus in Second Helpings spoke volumes about her(and McCafferty's)values and good sense judgement. Predictably, now that liberal do-gooder McCafferty has gotten your daughter to hang with Jessica by reading Sloppy Firsts,then Seconds, we find her masterpiece Charmed Thirds extolling a lifestyle filled with drunkenness,cursing,and casual sex.Darling indeed."
3,Charmed Thirds,"I haven't finished reading it yet, and it's been a little more difficult to get into than the other two, but I skipped ahead to like halfway through the book and it got good!!!! Well, interesting anyway. Definitely an easy read for someone who may just wanna get away from themselves for a while."
2,Not as Good as the First 2!,This addition was not even close to the stellar writing of the first two in the series. I bought this in advance and was sorely dissappointed when I got into this book. It seems like Megan (the author) was just trying TOO hard. I would reccommend getting this from the library instead of buying it! Hopefully the next one is better!
2,One to skip.,"I am probably the only person to read this without having read the first two books in the series. I think books, even in series, need to be capable of standing alone. This one does not measure up to that standard.I didn't have any trouble following the action. I just thought the book was extremely boring and the MC unlikeable. I also didn't like her boyfriend Marcus, at least as portrayed in this novel.I read the whole thing, only because I'd heard praise for Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings. This novel has turned me off so that I'm unlikely now to find out why the first two books earned that praise.I'd suggest if you haven't read the first books, try them. They have to be better than this. And I'd recommend skipping this. There was nothing redeemable in it."
4,i still want another look into jessica's life,"i didn't think i'd enjoy this book as much as i did. i loved the first two, and was expecting little from the third since it's been so long. but i thoroughly enjoyed this book and really would like another if ms mccafferty would put one out. i am invested in jessica and want to know how her life will end up (begin out of college at least :-D)."
4,Blue Topaz a Hit!,"It's always scary to buy presents on-line, especially jewelery, but these were a hit with my wife. The earrings aren't too heavy but certainly look substantial and have a nice color. Nice quality especially for the price."
2,Be careful - Reviews may not be as they appear,"The earrings look OK - certainly not like the picture, but they seem nice enough. I don't have a great eye for this sort of thing, so we'll see how it goes. She could love them.The big problem I have is that I selected these in part because of the quantity/quality of positive reviews but there is another reason they are there: Inside the packaging, it says if you review your purchase here on Amazon, you'll be entered in a once a month drawing for diamonds.That's some BS. Very easy/scummy way to get people to write positive reviews, whether justified or not. I guarantee some of these 5* ratings come from people who are just doing so for the shot at free diamonds.It might still be a good purchase, but be careful."
4,Nice earrings,"These were a gift for a friend. The earrings appeared to be well made with a nice clasp, so for the price I'm hard put to ask for more."
3,disappointed a bit...,"One of the earrings came defected; the front was facing back!The earrings are pretty but seriously, they look like $25 earrings. (or even less)"
4,Very well made,"Order came in a timely manner, and was exactly what was shown. Will order from this company again. Very nicely made."
2,Chopin or Lang Lang?,"Just listening to few extracts of Chopin Sonata on Amazon.com made it clear to me - I don't want to hear the rest. Let's take the Scherzo (2nd movement), for example. Lang Lang plays the middle episode not just ""a little slow"" but at least twice as slow. Whereas if you look in the score you'll see a strikingly different picture - Chopin (the composer!) asked for no tempo change, he never canceled Molto Vivace. Unfortunately, it is very common when a performer changes things here and there, so it sounds so called original and ""deep"", rather then trying to read attentively the composer's code, understand and make sense of it. I trust Chopin's genius and never those who put their ego above the existing Beauty."
2,Forever tacky?,"Contrary to the concert of praise surrounding Lang's virtuosity, these memories have little to do with music. Is fingerbreaking pace, music? The scherzo of Chopin third sonata says it all: it's all about how fast Lang can play, not at all about what Chopin's music means. The score -written by the decidely stubborn Chopin- doesn't acknowledge Lang's change of tempo: there is no such thing as the slow part in the middle. Once again this music shows how well out of his depth this virtuoso is and how much hype, marketing and fashion of the day are propping these automats. I'll take the impetuous Argerich over this anytime: at least she is genuine. Her scherzo is organic, fluid. A recent CD by pianist Svetlana Ponomareva displays similar qualities and although in the obscurity as much as Lang is in the sun, she follows Chopin's score in a meaningful and sensitive way. Check the soundclip on her website [...], compare with others on amazon, listen!"
2,Dancing with odd temp,"Lang Lang's powerful and fast fingers just do not work for Chopin. Chopin's music is as dedicated as ""dancing with soul"" for every note. Lang Lang's fingers are just too rude to interpret these subtle notes. For Mazart Concerto, if you have listened to Horowitz, you will be disappointed with Lang Lang's recording too. I don't even want to mention the rest recordings. As I know Lang Lang performs over 120 shows a year. He is talented and successful at his age. Yet he should spend more time on music itself and understand the virtue of difference. Beyond technical fast fingers, expression is all counts at last."
2,Long Long,"Chopin' Sonata slow movement is played sooooo slow, I thought there was something wrong with my player. My opinion? Great composers' music should be played more and interpreted less.This is an unfortunate aberration in an otherwise wonderful program, and beautifully recorded.Lang Lang has a wonderful tone but his intellectualism becomes a mannerism. Yeah, it seems to happen with prodigies."
1,music without a soul,I dislike the way lang lang plays the piano--it is simply showing off his technical skills but definitely without a soul.
1,I'm falling asleep,"Because of my school, I own 4 of these hideous beasts. While the books contain a rich assortment of information on their particular subjects, they can be verbose in the extreme. Additionally, they seem to be poorly organized as some other reviewers have mentioned. It is very difficult to pick up these books and stay interested for more than 5 minutes. I've had to purchase other books to actually learn the languages and utilize the Deitel books as references. Some people may find these books to be fine; I suspect we all learn differently. If you enjoy books that get right to the point and with better organization, look elsewhere."
1,Author has ADD?,"The book over explains the simple and skips the intermediate to go right for the difficult. The topics were all over the place. It was like reading a book written by a child suffering from A.D.D. Myself, as well as 14 of my classmates, deem this book responsible for countless wasted hours of unnecessary studying of basic programming. Our time would have been better spent taking turns kicking each other!"
5,Perl How to Program,"I teach Perl. Sure, the Camel is indispensable. But for teaching students, the Deitel books, and this one in particular, are best. Everything is step and step - everything is logically placed in order. Each chapter leads into the next. Hey, people. It doesn't get any better than this."
1,I smell a rat,"I am suspicous of all these wonderful reviews for what is essentially a by-the-numbers, cluttered text, which often explains in three pages what can be said in a paragraph. This book came out only a few weeks ago and it is over 1000 pages long, yet it has miraculously garnered 16 five-star reviews (so far). So many devoted readers? I doubt it. I smell a rat - perhaps from someone's Marketing Department."
3,The truth is somewhere in the middle...,"I have not read any other book associated with Perl. However, I have read other books of the same authors, so my opinion is based on a comparison of this book with their other books. Well, the book covers a lot of topics that could help people being familiar with other languages to create usefull Perl programs. However, there are a lot of points wherein the book is very ambiguous and the reader needs to search other resources so as to understand things. In conclusion, people who intent to deal with serious Perl programming could use this book only as a start."
3,Poor CD installation ...dies in the middle,"I have only read the first chapter. Looks okay. However, I bought it with CD rom at original price (not from amazon) and I have such a hard time installing it. The Damn thing doesn't install on either of my win2k machines nor on Red hat 9 which I dual boot with one of my win2k.I am really frustrated."
4,Perl - How To Program,I like software program book written by Dietel. It has an excellence of illustration and easy to understand step-by-step.
2,"Say that just one more time, in English though.","One simple example will give you some insight into the authors approach when it comes to this book. I suggest that you look up just the ""qw"" function in the text. Not once does it even mention what the ""qw"" stands for (it stands for ""quote words"" by the way). The function is used to automatically quote words in a list and gives the list of quoted words as it's output. While the explanation of what the ""qw"" does is decent, it doesn't even get that part fully correct because the text shows ""qw"" working like single quoted strings on one page and double quoted strings on the very next. Well, which is it?I have to agree with other writers here that the text at times looks like it was authored by someone with a serious case of A.D.D.Not all of the book is bad though. It does offer a much broader view of perl than the O'Reilly Learning Perl books, but fequently the quality of the explanations seems a little lacking."
3,rather heavy and clunky,"From the picture, I thought it would work out fine for a wider foot, even though it is a medium. This is not true, but that is my fault. Other than that, it is heavier and less comfortable than I thought it would be. I gave them away."
2,Better than the first one,"I made the mistake of ordering this book along with the prequel instead of one by one. After struggling through Tyranny of the Night, I decided that I might as well give this one a chance, since I had already paid for it and everything. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this book isn't quite as bad as its prequel. The lack of an editor isn't quite as apparent, and while the characters remain one dimensional and the writing style (or lack thereof) still somehow reminded me of sawdust (the dryness maybe?), on the whole this book was overall just a little bit less bad than the first one--I gave the first book two stars and I'd give this one two and a half if I could. Still, do yourself a favor and don't buy this."
5,pack turned diaper bag!,"My wife has owned this bag for 10 years and used as a school bag and for extensive travel. It's durable and 10 years later still in great shape. We are expecting our first child and when looking at the plethora of diaper bags my wife found herself comparing to the versatility of the mountainsmith and we decided to get another one. The old one is still in great shape, but we decided to get a fresh one for the diaper bag. The inside, wipe-able lining is great, side pockets for water bottles or bottles, and different pouches to organize baby gear. we are thrilled with our purchase.. and while we have yet to use since our little one is on the way, we're happy to have a diaper bag that will last beyond ""diaper"" years that my wife and I will both enjoy using!"
5,Simply awesome,"This book, which obviously was a labor of love by the author, is simply amazing. I purchased it after recently re-reading all of the Fleming novels. I now realize how much detail went straight over my head. The chronology alone is impressive, and the maps are great fun. It would be interesting to see a follow-up for the John Gardner and Ray Benson novels (and even Colonel Sun), although this would disrupt the chronology since a 70-year-old Bond running around the later novels would seem absurd."
5,James Bond Annotations,"I purchased this book as part of my research for a review of the James Bond series. This has been an excellent addition to my research. John Griswald has done all the heavy lifting. The exhaustive chronology is complete and accurate. I found the pictures of Bond and villains especially interesting. These drawings were commissined by the author from his own ideas of the characters and did not come through central casting.The amount of detail and trivia, like the exact card play in the bridge game and baccarat is fascinating.The book does not really add to literary review, but the book summaries are helpful. They do not give away the plot.Overall a great book for the casual and serious Bond fan and reviewer.NJN"
1,gross!,Was hoping this would taste good but I would of actually preferred those cheap top ramen packages over this!(which I hate)Very over-powering flavor that tasted nothing like anything out of any good Asian restaurant.Couldn't even take more than one bite before tossing it. Lesson learned to just go out to eat from now on when I'm craving Asian cuisine.
1,Do not recommend AT ALL,"I bought a couple of these at Whole Foods, couldn't finish the first one, and threw away the second. They do not even resemble food. Ramen kicks their butt. Absolutely disgusting. Ew. Gross. Don't waste your money the way I did!"
2,"Love Annie Chun's, this was not my favorite",I didn't like the taste or texture. I'm a big Annie Chun's noodle fan - I was not a fan of this product.
5,Annie Chun's noodles best on the market,"benefits from buying this brand: made in USA, all natural ingredients, cooks in 1 minute, many varieties of flavors to choose from. Even the cooking bowl is bio-degradable, so doesn't harm the environment.highly recommend Annie Chun's brand of noodles. Taste great, many flavors to choose from. Can't go wrong with this brand.makes a great lunch or a quick meal when you are in a hurry if running late for an appointment..."
5,Every Reasonable Doubt,"This is an excellent novel, with enough suspense and local recognition (Los Angeles setting) to keep your head in this book from start to finish. Well written with humor, sensibility, and a good analysis of ""office relationships""."
1,Little substance for $10,"This is little more than a Powerpoint in terms of real information. For $10 I guess you shouldn't expect much, but this was not worth the purchase."
1,bad item,used item tobe throen away.my used ribbon was bettwr than the one they send me . I donot know how to return this item?
4,Good for the money,"Seems to be a good scope. I like my Match-dot a little better, but then again I paid more for it too. I mounted this one on my .22 and it seems to work fine. I lost one of my turret covers (my fault) and the company replaced it for free. I do a lot of shooting at the range, so I wish it had a little smaller (2moa) dot, but for the $90. I saved, I can't complain."
2,Terrible sound,"Buddy Guy is great, but the quality of this CD is terrible. It sounds like it was recorded on a battery operated cassette recorder. Unless you're a hard-core Buddy Guy fan, I'd recommend that you pass this one by."
5,LOVE THIS TOY,I am so happy with this purchase. My son is about to turn 5 and I bought this for his birthday. Toy was way larger than I thought it would be which was a nice surprise. If you have a child who loves pirates this toy is a wonderful gift! It looks and feels like it is well made and durable.(which is great cause i am sure i will be washing constantly.) I can't wait to give this to him!
5,Easily The Best Tool Set I've Ever Purchased!,"I have always been a hardcore Craftsman man, and why not? Their warranty is the best in the business. But when I got my hands on this nifty set from GearRatchet(GearWrench)I was all smiles. So much versatility. It even comes with adapters so you can use your regular non-gearwrench sockets.HUGE bang for the buck! Excellent for mechanic or household jobs, and their warranty is now backed by Sears just like Craftsman."
1,no good to me,Fist off they where not 12 point found that out the hard waySecond the holes for the pass through are not big enoughi was very disopointed
4,Great set!,I purchased this set a while back from Lowes and I really like it. Good quality set and I like the pass through sockets for long bolts.
4,...Onorix...?!,"Fear is contagious, and so are the tracks on this CD. Attitude that would startle even Hitler on a South Park Sunday School picnic bonanza; with the Brady Bunch having been recruited by the Reagan Youth for A What IF.. Who cares musical journey...that would make Nancy wish she said ""yes""."
4,I really like it just one thing I dont like about it.,"I really like this gun, I love the power it has. It zips off lugnuts like their nothing. I like the adjustable forward speed. I was just misled by the fact that it doesnt have adjustable reverse, maybe i just didnt read it right or something. Basically it goes from 50lbs to 450lbs in forward drive. But in reverse you cant adjust the lbs, its just wide open 625ftlbs. So if you have a smaller bolt or nut you dont want to round off, it doesnt work so well. My dads older chicago pneumatic is adjustable no matter what so i thought this one was. Oh well I fixed it anyway by getting an adjustable regulator and some hose, I can attach it to it and adjust the air pressure down so the ft lbs is not as high. Thanks for the great product."
2,"Worse than Average, non-existent support & quirky","Product installation was a 7 out of 10 (10 being hardest), took about 45 minutes, and Netgear support WILL NOT support you unless you provide name, address, telephone, Serial Number, where you bought it,what day, etc. to some heavily accented person - at least 20 minutes just to register.1 - Speed is OK, but definitely not what's advertised or printed on box.2 - Signal is pretty decent around the house - 2 stories.3 - Works OK with mixed adapters - Linksys, Intel, Netgear4 - Security is problematic. Some sort of security does not allow accessto interactive scripted websites - you know the ones whereyou fill in fields and move on to next page? Just hangs. Support sitesays turn off SPI, still doesn't work.Definitely regret the purchase - too much trouble and Netgear support is exasperating at best."
1,WNR834 - Unreliable wireless,"I've own this device for 2 years now and I'm more displeased now than ever before. As we continue to purchase more wireless devices we have become ever more frustrated with this product. We havent had any success acquiring positive solutions from Netgear. I recently downgraded to a competitors wireless g router and we're completely satisfied now. The range of this Netgear router is paultry at best. Even if we're using our ipad 10 feet from the router, we cant keep a solid connection to the router. Our wireless devises keep a connection for about 3 mins before we have to manually reconnect again. When I purchased this product, it was top of the line in capability and price. It has NOT been worth it.It's easy to install, setup and administer; however, capability and realibility are just not there."
2,wireless router,We were able to hook up the router with Netgears help. It worked near the router but when we took the laptop upstairs we would lose the signal. Unfortunately we had to return it.
4,Problem-free usage,"This is the first wireless router I have used, and I relied on the saleman's recommendation when I bought it. I spent one tedious hour getting it set up. After that, it has been a joy. I have been using it for 6 months with no trouble at all.Followup: I started getting frequent dropped signals after 2 years and replaced this router. Apparently the router was failing because, with a new router, I'm not having any more trouble."
1,Worked great for one year. Now I have to reset it four times per day,"I am disappointed that it only had a lifespan of one year. It goes out with any moderate use and has to be reset. That is annoying when you are trying to work. After reading lots of reviews in many forums, this looks like a systemic problem. I'm moving on."
2,"Died on me twice: 2 months, then 14 months",This product died twice on me in less than 14 months. The first time it was replaced under warranty and the second time it died shortly after the warranty expired. Aside from that there were no issues with multiple PCs (up to 6) plus several wireless devices. Naturally I'm unhappy with the longevity so replaced it with a non-Netgear product.
2,It does not function well,"The look of this router is fabulous. However, the signal is NOT stable, it needs to re-set several times in the day! Some of the websites you won't be able to access, such as Google, my banking websiteAfter I changed this Netgear WNR834B RangeMax to Linksys router I don't have any problem at all! I'm happy with Linksys!I gave 2 star because of the look ;-) DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Very Poor,"I bought this router and spent hours, over two days, with online support trying to get it to work. The support people were helpful but do not work fast. Conculsion, I got a bad router and I needed to return it for another. I got a replacment and after less than three months it has completely died. Urgh! Either the design is flawed or the factory is doing a really poor job making them. Buy at your own risk."
3,tech support needed,The unit works well but is not as Mac friendly as I'd like. We had to call tech support after a month to reset some things. It may have been the result of a lighting storm. Their tech support people are in India. The first one we had was so hard to understand because of a strong accent. She also failed to solve the problem. The second guy was much easier to understand and fixed the problem quickly. Communication issues are common with the other Netgear products I have had.
1,Worse Netgear Product Ever!!,"Let me start off by saying that Ive been working on all kinds of networks for 8 years with up to over 1600 computers, printers, Nas, and anything in between.I bought this item to upgrade my parents wireless network. They have a desktop, 3 Notebooks, a 2TB Nas, and a printer. Setup on this item is a breeze as usual. Any one can do it. It took me all of 20 mins to set everything up. For the first two days everything went well. After the second day it has been hard to keep connected to the router. Anything that is hard wired works fine. The hardware that is connected wirelessly does not stay connected. The signal is very unstable and once it goes down you have to reboot or wait 30 mins for it to sort out. But once it is connected you do get 130MBS+.I have returned this item and bought a 3500 series hopefully it works better. A word of advice do not buy if you want to stay connected via WAN."
2,May be defective,The item would not connect to two computers. Other identical items already in use would connect. Please provide instructions for returning item for replacement.Doug Goodman
1,One Word: Lemon!,"This Netgear N Router was supposedly refurbished and tested. I could not get it work. The wireless blue light would not light up. I sent it back. It was reurned to me ""repaired and tested"". Guess what--it would not work again. This time the internet light would not come on when connected to the cable modem. Sent it back for reimbursement.The vendor, Reforger.com were cooperative and helpful but could not resolve the problem.I am sorry to say that this has left a very bad taste in my mouth."
2,An Infuriating Waste of Time and Money,"I needed something with good range, and this looked to be perfect. In fact it does have great range. When it works, I get 135+ MBPS in my office one floor away. However, in two weeks of owning it, I have spent far more time trying to make it work than I have actually using it. I will frequently lose connection in the middle of a session requiring restarts of the router, my pc, and on more than one occasion, complete reinstallation of the router and adapter. It's possible that the newer adapter drivers fix some of these problems. Now if I could only get on line..."
2,Wish I had read the reviews,This is a piece of junk. Wish I had read the reviews. What is worse is the Netgear support. Total waste of time. At least I have been able to get through to Dlink and Linksys. Based on the poor support I will never consider another Netgear product.
3,Set-up is a challenge,"Having set up wireless routers in the past, I was able to get this one up and running pretty quickly. However, if you have never done it before, look somewhere else. The set-up ""Wizard"" is not too smart. Finally, I abandoned the Wizard and did the set-up manually and it worked fine. I also had to update the wireless LAN card driver in one of my older computers to work correctly with this router. The USB wirless adapter I bought to go with this router did instal with no trouble. I'm not a network technician, but I think the knowledge necessary to get this router working is probably beyond the average home user who simply wants to get wirless going in the house. The router does give me very high speed with the wireless N adapter, which is why I bought it. So, if you can get it to work, its probably a fine peiece of equipment."
3,This router does not live up to its reputation as a long-range router,"I was disappointed that it did not have the range that reviews had said were its main feature, even when I put it in the higher frequency mode. But that it not your fault, not the vendor's fault."
2,Was a decent router... until it failed.,"At the time--and still even today--$130 for a router is not the low end of the market. This router worked reasonably well--no major complaints--for about 4 yrs. Then just suddenly died one day. Won't power up. I'm not sure what the average lifespan of a wireless router should be. I've got electronic components that are much more sophisticated that are 20 yrs old and still working fine. So, to me, 4 yrs seems like too short of a lifespan to expect for $130.To be fair, however, I've replaced many a router in my lifetime. A couple of years seems to be all one can expect from the typical router. I guess the figure that if they make them crappy enough and keep changing the broadcast standards, we'll just keep buying new ones every couple of years. What I'm looking for--what I think most people are looking for--is a router with fewer superfluous bells and whistles, a better range, and a higher level of reliability. Does anyone make such a device?"
4,great router at the time i bought this and still is!,"i bought this like last year and it has kept on going it was easy to setup for me, there was some maionr issues setting it up but after that i worked perfect i know there are some better ones out there now but this is still a great router for the price i paid for it so just wanted to put my 2cents in :)"
2,Scattered presentation style and lack of detail,"While this book is billed as an introductory text, there are far better texts available (see, for example ""The Story of Christianity"" by Justo Gonsalez). I found this book to be poorly organized, with scattered thoughts and a serious lack of detail where there should have been some (even in an introductory book). As an added book in a collection, this book is fine, but it should not be the first overview book you buy."
4,Pretty good supplemental text for an in-depth study of Church History,"One of the ""classics"" in Church History textbooks. A good supplement, though I wouldn't recommend as a primary text. Fairly extensive information on many church leaders."
4,Informative but can be too detailed,"This is a very detailed book covering many years and topics regarding the history of the mainstream Christian church. It does tend to meander back to Catholicism most of the time, but they are the leading Christian group.Overall, a very worthwhile book if you try not to get bogged down with all the dates and names put forth. From my limited experience, I think this is also a very thorough book which has gone through several revisions to keep it current.Except for the fact I needed this for a class, I would not have purchased it at full price, or close to full price."
2,Long,This is a meaty book that is hard to read. Unfortunately the writer has lots to say in a form that is tedious to read.
1,VERY BAD printing edition of a very good book,"The quality of this edition's print layout and typesetting is VERY VERY BAD. I just got the book today and I have to return it because it is very difficult to read: it is like somebody copied and pasted in a word document from an electronic book without doing any formatting at all.- The index contains only something like:Section 1 page numberSection 2 page number....... no titles.- sections have no titles only ""Section 1""- old page numbers will appear in the middle of the page and in the middle of the sentence- sections will start or end in the middle of the sentence- footnotes are not formatted different than the main text, so you don't know when the text ends and the footnotes start- old titles in the middle of sentences and pages (braking the text of the book).Awful publishing quality.Look for an older version of the book from another publisher, it may be of better quality."
4,Class A Textbook,"A History of the Christian Church was a required textbook for a class I recently completed. There are newer versions of books dealing with church history available, but this book is wonderful. At times the reader would like to see more information on major events such as The Great Awakening, but then it would have to be a multi-volume work. However, for the length and price, it is a wonderful addition to a researcher's library."
2,Needs editing,"The Kindle version of Peyton Place is a disaster. It is very poorly edited, from small typos here and there, to paragraphs and portions missing in their entirety and portions repeated in the incorrect place. While I am enjoying the story over all, the editing of the Kindle edition is making it very difficult."
1,Real Scandal Is Metalious' Plagiarism,"Grace Metalious' chapter introducing Allison MacKenzie is almost wholly lifted from the 1942 novel The Prodigal Women by Nancy Hale. Hale's introduction of her protagonist, Leda March, describes an alienated young girl walking in the woods, experiencing a moment of ecstasy, and being teased by boys. I can't give side-by-side examples without copying out both chapters-check The Prodigal Women out of your local library stacks and see for yourself. After discovering this, I surfed the Internet and read Emily Toth's biography to see if Metalious had ever been accused of plagairism and saw nothing. Readers, the publisher, and future biographers should be aware of the fact that Grace Metalious was a fraud. It makes me wonder if she crazy-quilted the whole book out of various lesser-known novels. I'm convinced that the guilty knowlege of her undeserved success and subsequent inability to get away with it again was a major reason why she drank herself to an early death."
3,Reason for name changes,"Peyton Place is a fun read although hardly great literature,thus the 3 stars. As a woman author writing a steamynovel that focused on the inner lives of women, Grace waswell ahead of her time, and I applaud her courage andoutspokenness. But I found the novel overlysensationalist; she could have made many of her pointswithout some of the gratuitous kink, particularlyin the life of the Norman character. Anyway, the reason I amwriting in is to explain to a prior reviewer the reasonfor the name changes. I am reading ""Inside Peyton Place"",Grace Metalious' biography, and apparently Graceused the names of real people in the town she wasliving in (Gilmanton, NH) for some of the PP characters.One of them named Tom Makris brought a libel suit againsther, and as a result she had to change the name of thatcharacter in the paperback, movie and televisionversions of PP."
5,A total hoot!,This book still works! It's a joy to read (if you have a stong sense of Camp). I teach it in Polular Lit classes and students go nuts over it... indulge yourself in a high claorie literary trash-treasure! Highly recommended!
3,peyton place revisited,"i could certainly have done without ardis cameron's verbose introduction. especially when ordering a sample of the book, imagine my surprise to find there was nothing more than the introduction there. gee whiz, what a thrill that was. regardless, once you can wade past the intro the book is well worth the read. use the intro to start a fire or line a cage."
3,Other Books,"A really pretty tame book about a particular town, where the author through an author character looks at the peccadilloes of various people in the town of the time.These range from sex, to being a scumbag employer, to drunks, wife beaters, all the usual stuff you would expect to find in a place in the country, as the Great Detective would tell you.Fairly dull."
2,fifties cliche crap,"The only reason I am not giving this lame shit two stars is because maybe it was revoltionary or some shit back when it was written in the fifties, but my, what a cliched fifties book.I guess I have to give props to the author for cramming every fifties cliche between its covers right down the gossipy old geezers in front of a town general store.This book has nothing to say, and ends in a lame court scene where the gossipy town passes judgement on someone from the lower class that was done so much better by many other books such as To Kill a Mockingbird.The characters are superficial cartoon characters, right down to a benevolent white-clad Colonel Sanders town doctor character and an evil mill owner that practically strokes a white cat as he stares maniacally out the window of his evil castle overlooking the town.This book was so crappy that after writing this I am reducing its score to two stars."
2,Get over it ...,"Scandalous though it may have been in the 50s, Peyton Place is pretty tame stuff today ... and despite the scholarly intro, it just isn't that great -- or that important -- a novel. A decently written beach read, no more."
5,A Blockbuster Novel Of It's Time.,"I first became interested in the book after seeing the movie with the late Lana Turner. However, I must admit that I enjoyed the book much better. It really was a groundbreaker for the late 1950's and early 1960's considering that the issues of illegitimacy, rape, emotional attachment not to mention the hypocritical attitudes of the people of the town, only when a young girl is put on the stand for murdering her stepfather and the truth about the type of man he really was makes the people realize that judgement should not come so harshly to those without knowing all the facts. A novel that in many ways stood the test of time and without a doubt a gem."
3,Peyton Place,"So far its OK. Not very exciting, but OK. I'll try not to fall asleep while finishing up chapter 5."
4,Liked it,I have been wanting to read this book since I was a child and finally ordered it. I really enjoyed this book.
5,perfect for my needs,"bought a bike w/out saddle bags so i bought this bag and i have no complaints, it big and a quality constructed bag."
2,Squirrel Guard,The specs say it fits a one inch pipe. Take them at their word. I tried to use it with a 3/4 inch pipe that has a 1.050 inch OD. No Joy!
5,Wonderful,"This CD/DVD combo provides enjoyable listening and viewing pleasure. I love it, and think it is great that someone would honor a person in this way."
3,Concert for Diana,It is a wonderful musical concert. Unfortunately about 80% of the performers where British unknown to me. All in all it is a title worth watching.
2,Too long,A good documentary on Diana's life would have served better. Going back and forth from concert to clips was too much and made the film longer than it should have been.
2,Condition not as described,"I thought that the condition could have been more accurately described as ""fair"". The cover was coming away from the binding, and there was a crease in it. The package was stuck to the book and there was grainy stuff inside it that felt like sand (probably from the deteriorating binding). The inside of the book was in good condition. I had purchased it for a gift, but it is not in good enough condition (not worth it to return it though)."
2,Too Much Bug Spray,Victory Garden is a beautiful book but was written before we became more conscientious about pesticides. I would buy a newer version (New Victory Garden).
5,Terrific!,"This was my first read by Jasmine Cresswell. The story was wonderful and the characters were great. I felt so bad for Maggie and all that she had endured at such a young age. If I rate a book with 5 stars, it's because I can't put the book down. The story was excellent and suspenseful from beginning to end. That's my kind of book!"
3,It's just okay,"Reads like a B movie where the characters continue to make stupid, predictable mistakes and are not particularly complex - or as bright as the author attempts to portray. The gratis love interest seems to serve only to distract from the already thin plot. The author clearly has not been a 15 year old teenage girl for a long time, as she writes from the teen's perspective as though she's about six. If you appreciate complex, clever who-dunnits, this story will disappoint. However, my 80 year old mom thought it was great."
5,"Supportive, durable shoe","I purchased these when I could no longer find the 605's in our local store. What a great change it was - they are very light, yet supportive. I have a wide foot and walk quite a bit (and wear these all day long) and they haven't broken down yet - it's been 3 months, and that's usually the life of my sneakers. They still keep my foot centered and supported. They perform well in the gym and walking on the street. Pink color is great!"
5,wide,"My review is really for an earlier version of this one, since they did not have this color when I ordered, but mine does say 609. I have trouble finding shoes wide enough, and bought these in a WW (my usual) and they are quite comfy, with room to wiggle the toes. They have good support, and have worn evenly (which means they aren't letting my feet tilt, also."
2,Not what it seems!,"I bought this book after searching the web for anything related to the 1954 movie, Forbidden Planet. Given that there was no information, it was a bit risky but I bought this book thinking it had some movie-related content, which it DOES NOT! By ""journal"", they mean a blank book with grid-paper pages. Very misleading, this should have been catalogued in a different section (eg. with notebooks, calendars etc). If you're after anything about the making of forbidden planet, don't buy this."
3,A review of Hartford's biography of Korolyev,"Sergei Pavlovich Korolyev was the ""chief designer"" responsible for the development of the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and artificial earth satellite (Sputnik 1). The authoritative biography of Sergei Pavlovich must probably await a translation from the Russian. More technical detail is required beyond what is available in Hartford's book. Still, the present volume is the best current study of Korolyev available in English. The book is more than adequate for a popular readership but will occasionally annoy the professional with errors like the one on page 255 where Hartford claims that the Soyuz reentry capsule is spherical and the orbital module is bell-shaped. The opposite is true. I also felt there was a bit too much speculation mixed in with the historical fact."
5,An account on the man behind soviet space program,"I discovered this book accidentally. Before reading this book the only soviet space personalities that I knew were Yuri Gagarin and Valentina Tereshkova. I guess I am not alone on this. Reading this book gives me an understanding that Russian space program went back much earlier than that of American. A lot of useful information about Russian space science and program, and its aspiration can be gained from this single book. This book talks a lot about Korolev, it also give good exposition on Soviet space program. One may wonder why Korolev has never been a household name like Gagarin, and how come the American is the first one landed on the moon."
4,Good book,"This book on Korolev is good, but it is rather slow at times. It is interesting how he pushed the Soviet program to beat the Americans at the space race, yet he had no ill feelings towards the US. He drive was pure science. Once Korolev died, the Soviets had no hope of getting to the moon first."
4,For a thoughtful view of the other side....,"I strongly recommend Contest for the Heavens, by Claus Jensen - The Road to the Challenger Disaster. This is gave me a fascinating perspective from the other side - i.e. what was happening in the USA in reaction to what Korolev was doing in Russia. And where those events would lead."
5,KC Hilites 4537 57 Series Clear driving Lens,Part arrived in a timely manor and installed with no problems. They look good. A lot cheaper than a local auto parts store.
1,don't bother,"I bought this with misgivings because the last Uniden I bought has never worked (too much static to hear anyone!) but since the previous phone was a cheap model I hoped for better with this one. NOT! Even the base unit was filled with static even 20 feet from the base! When I returned it, the clerk mentioned that her last uniden did not work either--too much static and she could not even make calls with it, so she threw it away.Uniden used to be great, but not anymore."
1,This phone is bad on static and power ! ! ! ! !,Just bought this phone at target two weeks ago and when you walk out of a room it goes static. Across the house and it dropped a call. We are going to return it right now save your reciept.
1,16 pages? That's all?,"I recently download Manning's ""Essential Guide to PeopleSoft Development and Customization"" for $32 and I think that had more than 16 pages devoted to COBOL, plus it had a whole lot of other helpful info about PeopleSoft development. Somehow, I don't this ""document"" is worth it's price tag. How about a preview?"
4,Fascinating Stories,"I agree with Ms. Walk's review. This book reflects the authors' sincere desire to share experiences that were fulfilling, exciting and eye-opening for them. There are good ideas here for anyone who is contemplating a life or work change. As for their experiences in the business world, I was struggling for advancement in the same era and can attest that their successes were truly remarkable."
4,Nice CD - Good tunes - Buy it,"Another good one from Above & Beyond. I'd say better/equal to their Vol. 2 CD. If you like these guys, Markus Schulz, Kyau vs. Albert, Gabriel & Dresden, ... you'll like this one."
4,"So many good tunes in one album, not bad mixing.","I bought this album mostly because of the great selection of tunes that were available in one cd. The mixing was'nt too bad hence the 4 stars, but it made sense ($) wise to get so many good tracks in one album. Some songs like 'sirens of the sea' havent even been released digitally yet so it made sense to get them on this cd.My Favourites:Eighties (Ozgur Can Remix) (4/5)Larry Mountain 54 (Original Mix) (5/5)Air For Life (Airwave Mix) (5/5)Sirens Of The Sea (Kyau vs. Albert Vocal Mix)(4/5)Alt + F4 (Original Mix) (4.5/5)Made Of Sun (KvA Volume Three Mix) (4/5)"
2,Anjunabeats,"I bought this CD cause I love Above & Beyond but when I listened to it I was let down. When you listen to a mix it has to create excitement in the listener, this disc didn't do that for me. It was like eating a stale box of Captain Crunch !! I am willing to try another one of these discs to see if they can redeem themselves cause I like Above & Beyond a lot."
3,Uneven and way inconsistent,"The album gets off to a great start with ""Third Uncle,"" ""Silent Hedges,"" and ""In the Night."" After that, it begins to unravel. The version of ""Spirit"" on here is awful; the single version is so much better. What hurts this album, also, is the self-indulgent tracks that are mere filler, like the title track and ""Exquisite Corpse."" Still, the three first tracks, the first two parts of ""The Three Shadows"" and ""All We Ever Wanted Was Everything"" do make this an interesting, if too flawed, album"
2,Superior Film - Inferior DVD,"Fish Story is a great, unique film not to be missed.However, you should avoid this particular DVD issue.Why?1. This dvd is NOT ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN. That is unacceptable.2. This dvd does not contain extras (like 35min making of documentary) that other releases do.3. The subtitles are off during the final sequence of the film. This is not absolutely crucial for enjoying this great film but the timing of what should be subtitled (no spoilers here) during this sequence hugely contributes to what the film is all about thematically.I suggest you either:1. What for a better Region 1 release (Blu-ray)2. Get the Region 2 UK version (which I own) that is superior to this one3. Stream it from Netflix (which is anamorphic and has correct subtitles)Don't get me wrong. Even if you are stuck with this inferior dvd, you will be satisfied. The film is that good.But as I stated above, you can do better."
2,Get The Blue Notes,"These Italian versions of the Cafe Bohemia recordings contain the exact same music as the Blue Note CDs The Jazz Messengers' ""Live At The Cafe Bohemia, Volumes 1 & 2."" (I have reviewed Volume 2 of the Blue Note CD if you would like to get some album specifics). My understanding is that for some reason Blue Note/Capitol/EMI does not have jurisdiction over this music in Italy, therefore allowing Giants of Jazz to issue these sessions. It is cheaper to buy these than the Blue Notes, but you get what you pay for. I sure did, I originally got these years ago thinking I'd save a few bucks, and what I got was poor sound, poor quality, and no session information other than the track listing. Stick to the original Blue Notes, and you'll get the original album art and liner notes to boot."
1,Did not like,My water space is fairly small so maybe that is my problem but it left an ugly oily sheen on the top of the water.
1,Don't buy this book,"I found this book of no value. It gives a brief, uninformative description of the different areas of the JBoss application server. This book left me more confused about JBoss than informed."
5,Brilliant resouce for JBoss configuration,"I would recomend it to everyone using JBoss. It really helped me, easy to understand and follow yet detailed enough to get you through the trickest circumstances"
1,buy the jboss group's book instead,I recommend getting the JBoss group's book instead. The development is partially supported by their documentation sales. I'd much rather have my money in their hands than Wrox or another publisher's.
1,Piece of Garbage,Dont buy this book. He has a lot of good topics but does a poor job addressing them in detail. A bulk of the book gives very scant information with very little coherence in the process and explanation. I agree with the earlier reviews ... this wrox book is not worth the money. I have used JBOSS and tomcat extensively in large projects and this book has not helped much. Save your money.
3,you'd be better off with the official jboss documentation,"I got little from this book. Was hoping to get an altogether different perspective from a development view-point. The chapter on CMP was about the only chapter of value to me.Also, the official documentation is much cheaper."
1,Prancing is right,"This so called ""world"" is almost incomprehensible. The characters have no characterization, the plot no direction, the story unreadable. I couldn't get beyond the first chapter. And even that was a chore."
2,Too heavy and wide,"I ordered a 9N, and it's NOT narrow. It's also a lot heavier than it looks. They're also reaaaallly flat and have little support. Bummer.."
5,"Cannonball's ""Kind of Blue"".","This superb recording exists also as ""Somethin' else"" in Cannonball Adderleys name. Miles rarely performed under another leaders name, but on such a recording he must have felt it was all right. This is a wonderfull recording. It brings ""Kind of Blue"" to mind, in its mellow and sentimental, but still very sophisticated manner. A very, very good recording, with some of the best Cannonball, some of the best Miles ever."
1,oh this book is bad!!!,"...it is very poorly researched. The map on the cover is wrong for starters. This is Mediterranean food according to Joanne Weir (not a person who grew up with Med food) who obviously has a very shallow understanding of the food of the region. This book proves that breezing through these countries as a tourist can not turn you into a serious cookbook author, or even a half-way decent one. ..."
2,For Entertainment Purposes Only,"I suggest reading this book ONLY if you would like to know the specifications of certain mentor bots as well as some of the basic components of autonomous robots. There blatantly ovbious errors in the book, I believe it should have been edited more carefully. I recommend reading it ONLY for a very basic basis of A.I and mentor bot composition.I disliked the fact that there was a large amount of the author's personal opinion written into the book, especially during his conclusion. I do not feel it is fitting to include personal opinion in a published work that is written from a technical (even if in layman's terms) standpoint.Secondly, there are instances of debasing statements and prejudice towards mentor bots that the author deems as inferior to other bots.Again, I would only recommend this book for entertainment or for basic understanding purposes."
3,Fun Book but Dated,"The plywood projects shown in this book are a lot of fun to review. They include children's furniture and a lot of knock down projects. Each project also shows detailed cutting plans so one can cut out the project parts with the least amount of waist. The book is dated in that it shows computer gaming tables and computer stands that will not work for modern machines. Also, it seems a huge number of projects use slots to fit the pieces together. This was a big deal a few years back (like 1960) but has gone out of vogue today.Overall, I liked the book but the projects are of limited use for me. I would still recommend the book to anyone interested in working with plywood or other sheet material.AD2"
4,Compelling,Lageg at times but great inside into the criminal mind and something test books couldn't include. Green river killer was caught after completion of book.
4,Bundy sells another book,"I have to admit, I bought this book to read about Bundy, not the Green River Killer. And Keppel does not disappoint: he got confessions out of Bundy that probably no one else could, things Bundy himself admitted he never intended to tell anyone. I skipped over the Green River Killer parts, and I think Keppel might have been better off writing separate books about his Green River experiences and his experiences with Bundy (which would make a fascinating book in their own right)."
2,"Bundy's words are enlightening, the authors are not.","The main problem here is Keppel's massive ego and it appears not to have recovered from the beating it took from Bundy. To think someone who gives expert opinions in court can get so many things wrong, and potentially convict people based on nothing more than a hunch and his 'superior' deduction makes Keppel almost as scary as Bundy.From the first page 'Bundy probably couldn't reach orgasm unless the victim was dead or unconscious' Keppel's credibility falls flat on its face, since I don't think Bundy's wife was either when he impregnated her during a prison visit.In short, Keppel's not a smart guy and his conclusions are often tainted by his own emotional needs.Putting all that aside, Bundy's words are enlightening and make the book worthwhile."
5,Eye Opener,"Ted Bundy talking about Gary Ridgeway! How much better does it get? Manipulating, charming, no feelings for human life.....just a amazing book that you can see how these guys think. Also, gives you an understanding why they are what they are."
3,SPECULATION PROVEN WRONG,"I believe Dr. Keppel milked this Bundy thing to way past the Florida execution, and I get the feeling that he was capitivated by Bundy or somewhat under his influence. But thank goodness we got Bundy off the streets and into hell. This wasn't the best true crime book by any means but had its interesting chapters and more insight into Bundy; but not much about the Green River killer who is now in prison. I liked the information on VICAP and happy to know that they are tracking these violent sociopaths/serial killers, and unfortunately, there's plenty out there in society. The book at least brought more awareness to the dangers that Bundy and others present to all of us, anytime, anywhere."
2,Way Over-Hyped!,"Keppel has a hard time telling this story. In fact, I'm not too sure what story he's telling. Is this a story about Bundy, about the Green River Killer, or about Keppel. On all fronts, it falls far short, is very fragmented and hard to follow. Worst of all, it left me unsatisfied--I still don't know anymore about Ted Bundy than when I first started the book. I would hardly say that Bundy reveals his secrets in this book. I would say instead, that Bundy takes Keppel on a boring self-absorbed ride through his own speculations about getting into the mind of the Green River Killer. What you do see is Ted Bundy as a bloated pontificator of the worst kind! Keppel fails to get from Bundy what he promises and as a result I feel the book did not deliver! Save your money, there are better true crime novels about Bundy than this--I hope!"
5,The Real Thing,"Rather than flock to be deluged with Thomas Harris' fantasies about what it would be like for a law enforcement professional to consult an incarcerated, highly intelligent serial killer on how to catch an active killer at large, why not read Keppel's book - which is the real thing? Keppel interviews Ted Bundy at length on the subject of the Green River killer. This book is not only fascinating on account of its subject matter, it is also extraordinarily well written. All-together a monumental book and a mesmerizingly literary read."
3,Self-Serving,"With all due respect to Mr. Keppel, I consider this book self-serving, i.e., an opportunity for the author to voice his opinions. For example, at one point, he allegedly shows a photograph of a corpse to Mr. Bundy and Mr. Bundy comments that the young woman's jeans are ""torn off,"" or words to that effect. Keppel uses this comment as evidence that Mr. Bundy murdered the woman because, otherwise, he would not have known her jeans were torn off. The author conveniently overlooks the fact that Ann Rule, in her book, ""The Stranger Beside Me,"" published several years earlier, gave an account of the murder of this woman in which she includes the fact that the victim's jeans were ripped or torn off. Mr. Bundy is known to have murdered 30 or so women, but when law enforcement officers attempt to attribute crimes to him (or any other individual) simply to clear the slate, it means someone else is getting away with murder."
3,From one sick mind to another,What an interesting read. This book lets you in to how the FBI tries to catch serial killers and how in some ways they all think alike. Ted Bundy's input at times seems comical and generic. but it is still an interesting read.
5,A superb account of the Bundy investigation.,"Robert D. Keppel is a skillful story teller who succeeds in drawing the reader into the world of the homicide detective. With astonishing interviews with Ted Bundy himself, he teaches about the tedious sorting of harrowing details that many homicide investigators must face every day. This is a wonderful book for those who want a serious look into the mind of the serial killer."
2,BAD!,"I read another reviewer point out that the title of the book should be""How I tried to outwit Bundy, and lost"". in my opinion, there couldn't be a better title. There are so many logical fallacies in the book that it really makes Keppel look quite unprofessional. He makes assertions and states as fact, information that is nothing more than suspicion speculation. Some of the information in this book has been proven completely inaccurate since its publishing date. All I ask is that a non-fiction writer present me with a review of the FACTS...NOT long winded, delusional, self promotion. One of the last things Robert Keppel writes is something about Ted being a truly insignicant creature. Well, the fact that you've written books about the guy would indicate otherwise, BOB!"
4,Pretty Good,"Pretty good indie rock concept album. From what I understand at the time of recording this album most was done in-stuido by one person so there is a lot of control in theme and direction of music.There are some high points such as The Past is a Grotesque Animal, but some low ones also that indicate that some of the songs are not fully developed. But the epic nature of the The Past makes up for these..."
4,it's a great album,"While there's no way this album could ever compete with the incredible Sunlandic Twins, there's still plenty of great pop music here that features that unusual, tricky and ultra melodic way to write a song that gives Of Montreal their distinct sound. While I'm a bit disappointed more people don't know about this band, this album wouldn't be a bad place to start. I can't really think of any Of Montreal songs that AREN'T good!"
2,they've lost it! they HAD it! it's gone!,"""the sunlandic twins"" and the one whose name escapes me (something about Cherries?)are wonderful, fun records. this one plods. the ostensibl single just sits there.THE SHINS now have competetion: for the lamest band out there.things to get instead: Robyn Hitchcock, the black watch, yo la tengo.i used to LOVE this band! ouch!!!!!"
1,professor's mind is elsewhere,"Usually I am a fan of the Sum & Substance series, but this one is very weak. In the beginning it is very obvious that Whaley's mind is somewhere else, he is correcting himself constantly (I wonder why the publisher sells it this way instead of editing it) and often you lose him because he is straying totally off the topic. Later on in the lecture he is getting better, but covers every topic only very lightly. You can only follow him if you know a lot about contracts and then you don't need the CDs anymore."
5,Entertaining & Enlightening,"Upon receiving my copies of ""Contracts"" audio CDs (Douglas J. Whaley), I am surprised at the negative reviews. Having completed two masters degrees, I have plenty of experience with poor instructors, poor textbooks, poor audio lessons; and poor universities. In my opinion, these Contracts CDs are excellent. Professor Whaley provides: (a) a clear speaking voice; (b) excellent inflection to keep the listener's attention; (c) good humor and vocabulary; (d) humorous case examples (e.g., minors as chimpanzees, dog law, paid-in-full checks, etc.); (e) well-organized lectures; and (f) plenty of detail to support further research. While I am not a Law student, these CDs are providing an excellent refresher for my MBA Business Law classes. These CDs are worth the price, and I will be ordering Professor Whaley's CDs on ""Sale & Lease of Goods"" (as well as the Finz CDs on Torts)."
2,Contract Law Audio CD-Sum & Substance,The Sum & Contract CD by Professor Whaley is very boring and lacking substance. The last CD-summary out of all the 7 Cds in the case was slightly helpful. Got rid of my CD after a week. I am about to try the Legend series or Fleming Fundamental of Law series.
5,A Great Review,"I really enjoyed Professor Whaley. He does stammer a bit, but he speaks very fast and covers a lot. I love his viewpoints and he clearly loves the subject. He has a great sense of humor and makes the lectures dynamic."
4,"Helpful, but not as much as other Sum and Substance series","I like this CD a lot. It's great for reviewing during my commute to and from law school. However, it's not as engaging as other Sum and Substance cds. It's pretty dry and the guy does not go in the best order. Also, for some reason the sections are not as broken up as on other series which makes it kind of pain if you aren't going to sit down and listen for a long time (since it's hard to find your spot again). I would definitely recommend it for any law school commuters or anyone with some down time that they want to use to review."
5,Just as I Remembered!,Our children enjoyed Music Machine and now THEIR children are doing the same! The order arrived promptly and in excellent shape...no complaints!
4,Music Machine,"I was taught this album as a child at school. Loved the songs and the lyrics. Positive message. Buying it as an adult, it was gfunny, I don't remember it being so country sounding. If you love country music, you will really love this CD, I'm not a fan of country, but my kids will still enjoy it."
4,just like I remember,"I bought this for my 2 year daughter. She doesn't understand the whole CD but still finds it entertaining while we are driving around. I had this as a child and it is still fun to listen to, not at all irritating. I didn't rate it a 5 because there are other kids christian CD I think are cuter, but this is still a great one!"
1,UGH,"I wish previews were available. I wanted the stories, not these individual songs. I want to know how to get the stories that used to be on cassette tapes that were like a read-along set. If you know what I mean and where I can get it, please let me know!"
5,Junior Boy is Pure Texas Blues!!!,Awesome Album with the Song Big Leg Heavy Bottom featured in a new Kirstie Alley Promo Video for Fat Actress.Tribute to Freddie IS PHENOMENAL!!!!!!!!!!Buy this!!!!!Support Junior!!!
4,NOT AS GOOD AS HIS OTHER CD,"This album is a little weak compared to his first one, it is well worth buying. Same quality as his first with a couple of weak cuts, but over all pretty good. He still plays great guitar on this along with his fine vocals. He improved quite a bit on his second effort."
4,A book I will read again,A TIME FOR DREAMS is a masterful debut and telling of an incident in history that readers will enjoy and savor. ~Beth Coogan for Bookbug on the Web
5,"Wonderfully Romantic, Highly Original--A Keeper!","I just finished reading Jen Holling's fabulous debut novel, A TIME FOR DREAMS, and all I can say is ""Wow!"" What a thoroughly enjoyable, utterly romantic story! Audrey and Brenden make a great pair, and their story is one that will stay with me for a long time. This book goes high on my keeper shelf and Jen Holling goes to the top of my must-buy author list. Thanks for a great read, Ms. Holling!"
3,"Great idea, but rubber pieces way too easy to lose.",I used this for a few months happily but then lost the little rubber bits.If I end up buying another I will probably either superglue the thing in or keep it in a ziplock bag by itself.
1,not good,It was not very accurate or fuctional. I mean it works but not the way i thougth it would. I would not buy again.
4,The Dowry of Miss Lydia Clark,Book arrived in excellent shape and as promised. I will definitely order from Amazon again.
4,a good coninuation,I enjoy books that take the story farther along with the lives of the characters so that they seem more real as well as you know them better.
4,Sorry to end the Gresham series,"Lawana Blackwell has written wonderful Christian Historical Romances. This is the last in this series and I have enjoyed it a lot. A young woman whom was raised in a supposedly Christian home with a Vicar/ Father, received little attention and care. She got drawn into a seriously wicked relationship at a young age, but during the story is wooed by the Holy Spirit and has a new life. At the same time, an old maid school teacher thought she would probably never marry until a handsome archeologist comes to town to explore...love is in the air in several places and you will have a pleasant time as relationships weave in and out of the story."
5,A must read series,"This is a wonderfully written series that is a rare find, set in the late 1800's England. I have read all four books in this series from Lawana Blackwell. They are truly novels and not just stories. The characters are wonderfully developed by this author. This is the third book of the series and I strongly urge you to start from the beginning and if you have read the other two books you already know you have to see what happens next in this community. Miss Clark has two gentlemen after her dowry and of course there is a new person at the Lurkspur Inn with a secret. All of my favorite characters are back with a few members of the community given more limelight. You won't read any book in this series in a day however, it's a wonderful series to come back to. I am so wanting to go to England to visit now."
3,Not bad,"Well, maybe it has not been a good idea to read all three books of Gresham Chronicle at once. The first book has been amazing, the second one very good but the last one seemed comparing with the previous experience a bit predictable and boring. I like coming back to the first and second book, but not to this third. But still worthy for reading, Mrs. Blackwell writes very well."
3,Too many new characters,"Blackwell is a wonderful author but in this 3rd book she brings in Noelle in London,not where familiars are. It is disconcerting and made me angry for disturbing the expected scene with new character. It was a disruptive move. It would better to put her in familiar setting then retrace her path to get there."
4,"Good, but liked first 2 books better","This was a good book, and I enjoyed reading more about characters from the previous books. I wish more time was spent on Lydia's story, as that was my favorite story line. I found it hard to really like the character of Noelle, although it did get a little easier as the story went on. I felt there was too much time spent on that story line. I was surprised to find myself liking Harold Sanders as his story developed, though. Overall, another good read, but I enjoyed the first two books better. However, I will be buying the next book, as I love reading about Gresham!"
2,Not as good as the Arco ones,"I got these because the pair cost less than one of the Orka gloves, but there's a reason why. The Orka glove is large, unwiedly and cumbersome, but that thing will withstand HOT temperatures. With these, I can feel the heat very quickly, almost as soon as with cloth gloves. I'm not impressed. I'd rather use one Orka than this pair."
3,Gel oven mitts,"They are just ok. Really hot plates get to you after a minute or so.A little cumbersome to wear unless you use both, hard to pick up a dish with just one hand."
2,you still feel the heat,"I was so excited about these mitts, but upon their first use, it was evident that the heat transfers through to your hands from the time it takes to carry a cookie sheet from the oven to a counter about 10 feet away. I'm not saying you'll get burned, but you'll be uncomfortably hot! I'd expected this innovative material to be better than thick cotton padding with a teflon liner, but it's not."
4,Great magnets!,"I have a very tiny kitchen and the magnets on these mitts are wonderful - you can place one on top of the other and attach to your fridge, freeing up quite a lot of space. They are fairly heat resistant, though after a minute or so, the heat begins to penetrate."
4,oven mits,"The oven mits work great to temperature, however they are a little slippery when handling smooth things like cookie sheets, you need to use 2 hands."
1,"Ouch, my burning hands!","I would avoid these mitts. They really don't protect your hands for very long. I have almost dropped several hot dishes before I could get them from the oven to a safe place on the counter because the heat just came through. In fact, the mitts themselves get hot enough that it's painful after you put the hot pot down! While the magnet is somewhat handy, I find myself wishing I hadn't thrown away my old cloth oven mitts."
3,Ill stick with the old fashond type myself,"Great for a quick grab, but otherwise I find them to transfer heat to easily"
4,A Good Overview for the Layman,"Although non-particularly well written, the book does provide a good overview of electric power generation."
4,Passed the JLPT 3... preparing for the JLPT 2?,"This is the third book of a series written by Ms. Kano. Be aware that the presentation of material is done in a much more ""global"" manner than the previous two. The preface sites that the book teaches an additional 240 kanji, (bringing the total number of characters taught in the series at this point to 740) and ever closer to the 1006 kanji that constitute ""literacy"" as an elementary school student (and sufficent to pass level 2 JLPT exam that tests 1000 kanji).The alternative presentation style is suited for teaching the etymology of these more difficult characters and reinforcing the last 500 you would've learned up to this point in the series. Attention is paid to using the same character in as many possible cominations as practical."
5,Longhorn Desert Pear,I looked for a couple months locally before ordering this online. I duplicated Longhorn Steakhouse's Desert Pear recipe. It is delicious! Product superb. Shipping high.
3,Slump,"After reading Instance of a Fingerpost, I ran out and bought three early books of this series of art mysteries. I thoroughly enjoyed the first, The Raphael Affair; however, this was a step down.The two main characters, Flavia and Argyll, did not seem to progress from the earlier book and actually seemed somewhat flat. Too much of the book was driven by Flavia's boss's bureaucratic battles and intrigues. The plot was okay, a bit hokey.Still, the cultural setting was very good and lifted the book from mere ordinariness.Although not as good as the first in the series, I will read some more...I think the potential is still there and I still want to like the two main characters as much as I did in the first book. Besides, the art world scene as portrayed is interesting enough to bring me back. Also Pears writing is good. All in all, this was an amusing fairly light read."
1,huge let down,"I had read an excerpt of Pears' ""An Instance of the Fingerpost"" a while back. It intrigued me enough that I wanted to read the book. While I have still not read that book, when I saw this one for a dollar at my local Half Price books, I decided I would give Pears a try. I found this book to be severely lacking in character development and found the plot to be thin. I now understand why they had the book priced at a dollar. The book tries to cover too much, which is evident in the subplot of the book involving the conflict between the aging detective and the scrappy new detective. This sub plot is tedious and detracts from the main mystery of the book. Overall the story line is weak, there is too much detracting from the main plot, and the character development leaves much desired. I do still want to read ""Instance"", but it will be a while before I pick up any other Pears book again. Don't waste your time and energy on this book."
3,"I agree: mediocre, but don't write off the author or series!","In general, Giotto's Hand is not the best in this series. But I urge the previous reviewer not to give up on this author. The other books in this series (I've read every one but the Bernini Bust because I can't find it!). Death and Restoration is GREAT and so are the others. D and R is a later installment; Pears is getting better with these characters as he goes on. So, try another and you won't be disappointed. This one is just not his best. Other good ones include the Titian Committee and the Last Judgment."
4,"Not Pears' best, but still good","This is the second Pears book I have read, and I thought it was excellent, but not as good as ""The Last Judgement."" It certainly references artists and art history more that the latter, but it is not as thrilling. The references to the politics of a small country town in England are funny and entirely believable. The two main characters, Flavia and Jonathan, are entertaining as always, but they are not as well developed as they were in ""The Last Judgement."""
2,eh...,"Maybe the foodies in my house don't have sophisticated enough palates to appreciate this. But we really couldn't tell the difference between this and white table salt. Maybe it's not as crunchy? Except that when I used it for baking, it made the bread pink/flesh-colored. Yikes."
4,Fun for what it is...,Not bad. Not great. I liked one of her songs from a movie soundtrack so found this one. Real catchy tunes.
2,Lattice Outback Hat purchased through Amazon.com,This hat was too big--in fact it was the same size as the medium. I returned it and received a refund. I sure wish it wasn't so big. My old one is coming apart after 5 years.
3,blank pages,The introduction and translations are very well done. My only complaint is that starting on page 164 every two pages is blank. This means that a significant portion of On Breaking the Two Desires is missing (this is the shorter of the two parts).
2,Stay away from this company,"This is a no-name company that is just buying cheap drives and sticking them into a case. The 300 GB I have is slow and constantly loses it's USB connection to my iMac. I tried to do an RMA and found that they have outsourced all support to a 3rd party company and that company is completely unresponsive to the RMA request. No response at all even though they're web site sys 2 days for an RMA. My advice is to stay with brand names because when and if you need support, these fly by night co's won't be there for you. It costs them too much to support anyone. They're only interetsed in sales."
3,This work is quoted my county planning and permit officers,"The book was purchased in CD rom form. There is key word searches for specific items. Every builder needing a permit to start constuction should know this book well. Another company that puts out a similar book is called Boca. They supliment and overlap the UBC. Both are handy, but very over priced."
3,'97 UBC,"I needed to order an out-dated code book, and found a great price on Amazon. The book was shipped the same day that I ordered it, and it was as described: new, still in plastic wrap."
2,you guys sent a wrong chip (Vol.13 soft rock/beatles/elvis) I ordered pop songs and elvis collection,You guys sent me a wrong chip (vol.13 soft rock/beatles.elvis) I ordered pop songs and elvis collection that's reason why i don't like it
4,If you're from the USA and interested in Canada...,"...read this book. It is a decent primer for US residents who want to learn more about our oft-neglected neighbor. Warning: Mr. Blanchard is quite liberal, and liberal policies (US & Canadian) are treated matter-of-factly. His conservative successor as governor of Michigan (John Engler) has, in most people's opinions, done a better job. Interested conservatives will still enjoy the book--just keep a few grains of salt handy.Canadians might get a kick out of a quintessential ""American discovers Canada actually exists and is also pretty neato"" story."
2,Not for a serious child...Too sad when it dies.,"My grandson kept his test tube alien alive for almost a year! It died today and he is in tears; literally grieving over it. I'm sure that the fact that he has surgery scheduled for tomorrow for a broken nose exacerbates the grief. But, he is a very serious child and the alien dying would be a big deal to him regardless. And don't buy one if you're going to be flying airline:-) You have to empty the water out of it before security and refill it on the other side of security and then have to try to keep it from spilling during your flight. It is not a fun toy anyway. I would not recommend it."
1,CUTE IDEA THAT DIDN'T MEASURE UP,THE IDEA WAS GOOD. IT IS NOT VERY FUN OR EDUCATIONAL. ALL YOU DO WITH THIS IS PUT WATER IN IT AND SIT IN THE DARK OR LIGHT. YOU CANNOT MOVE IT AROUND. IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING TO MY DAUGHTER AND MYSELF.
3,"Good, but not the best for on rotation","Pocket Emergency Med is probably a better choice for rotations, it's a quicker read that dives into what med students need for presentations (differentail, tx, etc.). This has just a touch more info that won't be as easily read in the little time you have to prepare for a patient."
5,Excellent drink,Perfect for lunch and dinner if you like hot beverage with it. In breakfast i prefer coffee for snack Celestial Seasoning APPLE CINNAMON.
2,DON'T BUY THIS VERSION OF A TRUE CLASSIC!,"Arthur took a classic and added his own garbage to it. I started reading it (and getting alot out of it) when I came across some material that just didn't have the ring of truth in it. I looked in an older copy of Think and Grow Rich and discovered that the parts that I didn't agree with (from a moral and business standpoint) were the lines that Arthur Pell added. The up-to-date examples were ok, it was the changes to the original core values that I just couldn't tolerate. Get the original or another version that has high reviews. I give this version 5 stars for the Napoleon Hill part, -3 stars for Dr. Arthur's input, for a total of 2 stars. DON'T BUY THIS VERSION OF A TRUE CLASSIC!"
1,Waste of Time,"This book purports to contain all of the text from the original edition, published by Napoleon Hill in the 1930's. However, I have a 1940 edition in my library, and I have compared this new version with it. This new one doesn;t come close to containing everything that was in the original. In fact, this new version is confusing. It is a desecration of Napoleon Hill's book. Save your money."
1,This book is a major disappointment,"I bought this book with high, but nervous expectations. I was looking forward to seeing how this book had been ""revised and updated"" for the 21st century. What I found was a terrible hatchet and cut-and-paste job on Napoleon Hill's classic book. The editor, Arthur Pell, completely destroys the rhythm and flow of Dr. Hill's ideas by inserting contemporary examples at the end of Hill's chapters. It's a travesty. We don't need a ""21st century version"" of ""Think and Grow Rich."" The one that has worked so well all these many years is still the best. If someone wants to publish a 21st century book, they should simply write an entirely new one. Even minor revisions of a classic like ""Think and Grow Rich,"" to eliminate outdated language or correct errors, should be undertaken with the utmost care and respect for the original. When the project is over, it should still be Napoleon Hill's book."
3,"Some good, some bad","I had read many reviews before purchasing this book and found it to have some good insights into how one thinks can indeed make or break a person. There were concerns by some about the intervention on the 21st century update, but I did not see any visible signs of what was changed having not read the original. In my opinion the author was way off base in terms of religion and its impact on people. His lead me to believe that he believes all roads lead to God, embrace whatever you want. If it had been a book on religion, it would have been expected...but a book on wealth?With anything, I try to take what I feel is valuable and leave the rest. My preference lead to the more practical in wealth building, but this did remind me to think thoughts that are conducive to wealth. In this it was worth the read."
3,Not The Original,"I read an original version of ""Think and Grow Rich"" many years ago (decades)? It's one of the classic self help books of all time. I borrowed this version from a friend as I wanted to read it again. To my surprise it wasn't the same book. As other authors have stated new ideas have been added to Napolean Hill's text that don't quite jibe with the original. I thought this was unnecessary. I'm giving this version 3 stars as the book is still basically ""Think and Grow Rich"". However I would track down an original if possible. As there are so many editions out there this shouldn't be hard to do."
5,Center Piece To Your Library,"I probably read this book about 8 times! I just started reading it again, the ideas and concepts will blow your mind. It is the ultimate guide book to riches and success taken from a life long research directly from the richest men in America. This book should be the masterpiece in your library, you should also find the Limited Edition hard cover with gold binding. You will never look at success the same way again after you read this amazing book by DR. Napoleon Hill.Armen TatiyantsAuthor,The Power of Leadership ""Becoming The Leader Others Will Follow"""
5,perfection!,"whatever your position may be in the world, you owe it to your self to read this book! there are a few staples, and this is one of them. I am an agent at the top producing real estate office in a southern california area and i was number 69 out of 70 agents. by year end i am now at 40, and this was only my first year! i will read it again and you should do the same! THINK AND GROW RICH! Burt Bakman"
5,A great guide to help you attain your goals,"This book focuses on the BE of the Be-Do-Have principle and is a must read in success and personal development literature. If you have the time, read the original Think and Grow Rich first by skipping the editor's comments and then go back and read in its entirety. If not you can read it all the way through from the beginning, as this updated version includes several updated and modern stories are extremely helpful including more background on Mr. Hill and his struggles to get the book published. He truly lived the principles he presents. Most all of this information is useful because it is based on sound principles. Since the book is lengthy, I also highly recommend the CD audiobook."
2,Seems like an old book,"The book that I received has pages with different lengths. So, it doesn't look like a brand new book."
3,"The Original ""Self-Help"" Book Doesn't Age Well","While the book's concept intrigued me, it also lost me when Hill started talking about the ""ether fields"" and telepathy. No amount of ""magical thinking"" can make someone rich--the best sections of the book are the ones that talk about setting and meeting goals. Even when Hill wrote the book in 1937, pseudo-science such as telepathy had already been debunked. The 21st century updates add new stories but fail to address Hill's unscientific notions of ""ether fields."""
3,Emphasizing a good basic strategy,This book emphasizes the process of persistence. It's content is fairly dated even though there is updated commentary. It is good for what it does.
3,Pleased,The books were fine the only problem was that you guys double shipped and charged me twice. this has been the worst experience I have had with Amazon.com and I have been waiting on a credit from a previous order and can't seem to get things straight. The print on the Think and Grow Rich is still not quite as I had viewed it on the website. Thanks.
3,Think & Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill,"It said it was like new condition, but actually there was a lot of writing inside the book, so it really was not like new."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,If you are getting this book because it's plugged a million times by everyone involved in 'The Secret' DON'T DO IT. I did and I pushed myself through the first 2 chapters and eventually gave up. It's boring and honestly it sounds like a bunch of BS. If you understand 'The Secret' than you don't need anything else. My advise would be to work on applying the 'rules' of 'The Secret' to your daily life and be happy at everything you do. Peace & Love
1,ARE YOU PEOPLE NUTS?,"This book is ridiculous. The only ones getting rich are the people selling these brainwashing books! You can't ""THINK YOURSELF RICH."" Take the red pill already."
5,Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill,A must read for anyone going into business for themselves and reaching their goals in life.
3,Early tome on the power of positive thinking,"This is a very old book, a predecessor to The Secret. It's a self-improvement guide written by a man who looked up to some of the old inventors and leaders such as Edison and Lincoln. He has some great suggestions for thinking positively and getting control of your thoughts and intentions, but he does have a problem with speaking concisely (he sort of drones on and on about the same point). Not bad but I probably won't read it again."
1,Garbage,"Think & Grow Rich is one of my favorite books.This edition of Think & Grow Rich is garbage. The editors added useless and sometimes contradictory information to this book, while editing out and changing the original content.Do yourself a favor and buy an unedited version of this book."
5,Exactly What The Title Claims,This book is exactly what the title says. Your life becomes what you want and think it will. This is another of my core principle books that I have based my entrepreneurial life.
5,If You Want To Be Successful In Business READ This Book!!!,"I believe to survive and excel in this day and age in business there are 3 bboks that one must read. Think and Grow Rich being one of them. The principles that Mr. Hill came up with many decades ago, still ring true."
4,Used Book,"I received two copies of Think & Grow Rich...updated. They were in PERFECT condition. Thanks, so much.Jackie Vail"
1,Bad recreation of Think and Grow Rich,"Please be aware, fellow Amazon customers, that this is a bad recreation of the original Think & Grow Rich book. It has been ""updated"" for the 21st century, so the author claims. Updated really means...muddled with.This audiobook version is narrated by a guy with a monotone voice, whom beyond being boring and hard to listen to, has taken the original version of this book and twisted & changed it into his new version.I listened to the first entire CD from this guy and I felt like I was listening to a bad Amway sales pitch!!! UGH!!!I cannot believe this guy would take a great book like this, which IS in the public domain, change it and put Napoleon Hill's name on it. This book is based on the original one by Napoleon Hill, but it is NOT by Napoleon Hill.This is rated one star by me. I would rate it NEGATIVE 5 STARS if I could.Save your money. Don't buy this edition of this book."
1,Read the original - no updating required,Does Lincoln's Gettysburg Address need updating?Do literary classics need updating?T&GR; doesn't either; the original version is still an inspirational and motivating classic.
2,Think and Grow Rich (CD) Revised for the 21st Century,"The book is wonderful, the CD I am sorry to say fell far short of the mark.I was very disappointed in the reading by Joel Fontinos."
4,"Original Book is great, but this ""editor comment"" version is too much","The book is great. But it is frustrating to keep hearing the ""editor's comment"" and then ""end of editor's comment"" and then the comments from the editor. I appreciate the editor putting in his or her two cents, but it is frustrating when you get into the deep thought about what Napoleon Hill is saying, then suddenly, the message ""editor's comment"" disrupts your thought. To me, it is an ego trip of this editor by putting in too, too much of his comment. The whole CD 2 of the 9 CD is packed with Editor's comment. It is frustrated keep getting interrupted over and over by the ""Editor's Comments"" and I decided to vent online to let someone else know not to buy this version. If you want to buy, go for the original, the unabridged version of Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich."
4,Inspiring.,"It's a great book and most of the themes are a confirmation of things that I've read in other books of this same type,"
1,a terrible edition!,"A terrible edition -- and a disgrace to the life's work of Napoleon Hill. I bought this thinking it would add to my appreciation of his life's work and masterpiece. The book says it is ""updated for the 21st century."" It is not. It ruins a great work of success literature by diluting it."
5,Great,"Order was received when it was supposed to be in the condition listed, would buy from this person again. Thanks again."
5,Think and Grow Rich,"This book is a wonderful resource that should be kept and used on a regular basis. I have found that there is so much information that I have to go back and re-read, underline, and highlight. I don't know that I would purchase this edition again as there are some strange breaks in the wording which don't make sense. Nonetheless, I would recommend this book in general as a ""must read"". I wish I had read it years ago."
1,Can't get past the nasal voice,"The book was amazing so I borrowed the cds from the library. Listening was a completely different experience. I couldn't get past the narrator's nasal voice, and he read it like a textbook so it just didn't sound inspiring. I'm going back to reading the book, the audio version ruined the experience for me."
5,Price sure beats Sephora and department store prices!,I purchased this cologne for my hubby for Valentine's Day. I didn't want to pay the $60+ it is for this size at Sephora and most department stores. I was so happy to find it on Amazon.com for half the price! It arrived in perfect condition and super fast - received within 3 days of ordering with free super saver shipping! It was boxed and shrink-wrapped as if I had bought it at the store! My hubby loves the cologne and also appreciated the $ I saved! He smells delicious! Thanks Amazon and Burberry!
4,Growing on me,"First impressions were a bit sweet for my tastes. However, the scent does grow on you, and now I prefer this to my other choices. Give it time to develop...there are subtle changes over the hours while wearing. Pleasant and mature."
3,"Smells invigorating, but wears out extremely fast","This is a quality cologne, and it seems perfect for a young professional. I use it as my default work cologne. However, at least on my dry-ish skin, the cologne wears out absurdly quickly. The top notes seem to be gone after less than a couple hours, and I doubt even the deeper notes are detectable after four or five hours. Even at the beginning, it doesn't have much power, which is a positive quality if you're going for subtlety.If you're looking for a cologne with a punch, go for something with more musk and more staying power. In the land of men's cologne, this one is a bit of a boy."
5,Luxury perfume...,"i bought it for my brother and he likeed it, now i'm jealous its really good perfume i will buy it for my self."
2,A bit too flowery,"Not what I expected after reading the description, but then most men's fragrances are not. Paul Sebastian is still my favorite sine Yardley of London Musk for Men is no longer made. If anyone knows where it can be purchased, please let me know."
1,Pay Retail!!!,"I bought this product of Amazon and I'm really disapointed that I did. While the product does appear to be authentic and smells like the authentic product it is not nearly as potent nor as long lasting as a store bought bottle. My last bottle, bought from a department store, took only 3 sprays and the scent lasted all day. The bottle I bought off e-bay takes 6 or 7 sprays and the scent is almost gone by the time I get to work. Extremely disapointing!"
3,"Nice, but definitely a mature fragrance...","This is a nice cologne. The previous reviews about the scent are correct, the most noteworthy being the fact that you should use it sparingly. After all the other scents have faded (which is within about 5 minutes of putting it on), you're basically left with a musk - which isn't overpowering, but definitely noticeable and lingering - and a little hint of vetiver/sandalwood.As stated in the title, this cologne seems to be suited for those in their mid 30's and older and for more formal situations, which is the only reason I took a few stars off. I like more flexibility in a fragrance.All in all, a good cologne, though."
4,Smells good but wish it reached out further.,"The smell is good and lasts longer than you think, but the problem is no one will notice really since it doesn't go further than your clothes. It does make my shirts smell great for days even after once. If you already have a women who comes up close, then it's great but for a bachelor, you need another perfume to lure women in."
1,Let you order when it is not instock. Misleading.,"Product was supposed to be in stock and have been waiting for a long time for shipment. Back ordered, is the excuse. Should not have been in stock message. I believe it was done on purpose. Buy from someone else.Plenty of suppliers out there."
5,Great Product!!!! Great Price!!!,"I am so happy that I found the Burberry Touch for Men on Amazon! All the retail stores wanted $60 and up, but I got it on here for only $35! My BF loves this stuff so I am happy that he is happy with the gift!"
4,Great scent that isnt too heavy and last for hours!,At first thought i had felt this scent was too powdery and floral. After wearing the colgne for a few hours the floral scent calms down and i was told i smelled like baby powder. Not sure if thats a compliment or not? I do like the smell but im not too sure if ill buy again.
2,Smells like a scented maxi pad.,I've had 3 different girls tell me this smells just like a scented maxi pad. I'm not convinced this is flattering.
2,Not quite masculine,"I know this product is really well-reviewed, so when I got it I was a bit surprised at the smell.It's actually a very nice scent. It has more complexity than you might expect, and a good whiff doesn't kill your nostrils.It also lasts a decent amount of time, and it's definitely a scent you can wear in everyday environments, such as at work.My problem with it is that it's quite a flowery scent. It's something you might smell on an older woman, like your Mom. Still a very nice smell, just not for a man in my opinion.Maybe that's why there are so many good reviews, is because women might like the smell of it, so the guys get good responses, and therefore write good reviews?And yes my bottle was sealed and says FOR MEN on the bottle. Too bad I can't return it, maybe I'll give it to my Mom for Christmas."
1,NOT A NICE SMELLING FRAGRANCE,I do like most of Burberry's line of colognes but I found this one to have a sour smell to it. I'm very surprised most people liked the cologne. I've been wearing cologne for over 20 years and have had dozens of different bottles and this one was definitely up there for the worst. I know colognes may vary from one person to the next but this one had a salty and sour fragrance to it.
2,Toxic,"I'm overlooking the fact that the product I received was obviously a previously returned item (the box was beat up and torn and I had one full ounce less product than marked on the bottle). The smell of this product, while not offensive, is almost nauseating because it's so overpowering. I put a dab on and my unsuspecting wife thought I was painting something with oil-based paints. Also, the ingredient list cold be considered a compendium of bad chemicals. Surprised by all the glowing reviews."
3,Interesting,"A historical thriller. You really get a sense of the time and place that Busenkell is writing about, although the style leaves a little to be desired. A few typos and amateur phrasing/word choice ruin an otherwise good plot. For those interested in Erle Stanley Gardner, this is a must-read."
1,BEWARE: Does not play in computer drives,"Even though there is a warning about it not working on DVD drives that do anything other than play, who expects someone to read the product specifications for a movie DVD? I know I haven't since the days of having to worry about 4:3 versus 16:9. I only did this time because I couldn't understand why it wouldn't play on my computer. I have no separate TV and DVD player, and, regardless, one expects a movie DVD to play in any DVD drive, period. I haven't had this problem before, and I hope it doesn't portend a coming trend."
5,Much loved family movie,We first watched this movie 16 years ago with our older girls and have continued the tradition with the younger ones.
3,Fun Movie,"I watched this movie when I was a child and have been looking for it for about four or five years. Finally I found it and it is so fun to watch. I watched it with my niece (11) and nephew (9) and they both liked it a lot, as well. I recommend it."
5,Wonderful and entertaining,I use to show this to elementary students for many years (recorded on VHS from the TV) and I finally own it on DVD to show my own child.
4,Finally!,"I was so thrilled to see that you can finally get a legit copy of this wonderful kids classic on DVD. Growing up, this was a staple holiday classic in my family and still remains one of my favorite movies of all time. A Halloween without this movie is not a proper Halloween. Also, if you have never read the Ray Bradbury book definitely check it out. Get your copy while it lasts!"
4,A Memory,"I have been looking for this dvd everywhere. I loved it as a kid and no one ever seemed to know what I was talking about, but now with the dvd they believe me. It was just as good as I remembered it being. It also got here quickly and was in perfect condition."
4,~,"This product was very neatly packaged and in excellent condition seeing as it was ~brand new~! I was very excited to see that The Halloween Tree had become available on DVD format! I'm not quite sure if it is remastered or not, but the video is pretty good considering how old it is. My only personal qualms is that my individual copy stutters a bit at a few parts. Not sure if it's my DVD player or the product itself? If so, it may just be my copy. (:If you enjoyed this in years past, you will not be disappointed with this purchase! It will continue to be a favorite for years to come."
5,Best Halloween movie,I look forward to watching this every year around Halloween time. I love it. It's not scary but informative and entertaining.
5,Love this movie,"When I was a little girl I remember this movie playing every Halloween, so when I came across it I had to buy it. Now my son enjoys this movie and it is very educational. The movie is about how different eras and different ethnicity's celebrated the meaning of Halloween, just not how it is commercialized these days! It is VHS but for the price and the enjoyment this movie brings, the purchase was well worth it!"
4,Childhood classic!,The DVD contains the original cartoon classic as described. Rated it 4 out of 5 stars due to the picture quality. Appears to be a VHS to DVD copy. All in all I'm content with my purchase.
5,Awesome Classic!,This movie is a classic and should be watched by all around halloween time. good family show for all ages
3,Not So Pleased,"I was so happy to finally get this on DVD. I lost my VHS copy years ago when moving and have been looking for a replacement since.The biggest problem is the fact that I cannot play it on my DVD recorder. Why do companies do this????? I can play it on my computer and my DVD player but I have to set up the player to play through the recorder which is a pain.Why can't they just make these to play on everyting? I have the three season set of Danny Phantom a friend bought for me but I have the same problem with this, along with other cartoon related DVDs."
5,Worth the Wait,"I highly recommend this award winning cartoon for older children as well as children under 8 watching it with their parents. I've been laboring with watching it on a self-taped VHS tape (very grainy!), but I was very pleased to learn that Warner Bros. Achives just released in as a Made to Order"" DVD. I've ordered it and can't wait to watch it on DVD this coming Halloween. Thanks Warner Bros!"
4,Great Halloween Movie for Kids!!,"I just received ""The Halloween Tree"" movie in the mail. I am watching it as I type this. I was a little worried ordering this because it came from Media Asia, but nothing to worry about. It is in English. It is a little grainy, kinda looks like something out of the 80's, recorded off TV and put on DVD, but I can live with it. It works on my DVD player, which is a Vizio.I paid a high price for it. Almost $30.00, but again, I wanted this movie in DVD.This is a great movie for the kids on Halloween, I am very happy with my order and if you want this movie, get it. It may be a while before it comes out on DVD here in America.If it would come out on Blue Ray here in America, I would probably buy the newer copy, but again, who knows when that will happen. Maybe never.Happy with order, love the cover of movie case and DVD.Just looking for a higher quality when it does come available."
5,Quality and depth,"I loved this book because of the depth it gave my Bible study. It goes in-depth into the language of the Bible, with the meaning of the word choice. It also talks about the nature of the Lord, helping me know He understands what sorts of things I struggle with and how He can guide me. In looking for a fuller way of life and faith, this book is full of ideas for improving the quality and depth of my life and faith. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants an easy yet deep reading about the Lord and life!"
2,The promising start dwindles away,"I don't know what happened to John Ney Rieber... after his promising start on The Books of Magic, his stories slowly started to lose that magic. These stories fall at the end of Rieber's run at the title, and they're mighty thin gruel compared to what came before.It may be the fact that any elements of light or real humor have been vacuumed from the book. Molly, a fantastic creation, isn't very much in evidence here and Tim Hunter's incessant whining simply becomes too much. Artist Gross took over the book after this series and made some improvements, but it was too late and the book ended. Rieber did a Books of Faerie with Molly that showed the man had lost his way: It shared much with this volume in the incomprehensible storytelling and not-very-interesting characterizations.So, for completists only, and only for those completists willing to have their fond memories of the series in its heyday sullied by this volume."
3,Lovely but Small,"The blanket was beautiful, soft and heavy duty but barely made the edges of the bed. I ordered king size but there was not alot of extra hanging over the edges, nor in fact enough to tuck in the end of the bed."
4,an underrated class,"If you like slapstick comedy this movie is a must see, I'm thrilled that the DVD is finaly coming."
3,MOVING VIOLAIONS,"Not a brain challenging movie, but deliciously silly and funny. Just sit back and enjoy and laugh."
4,one of the best comedies of the 80's,"This movie is about some people who lose their driver's liscence's and have to go to traffic school to regain them. Of course, the instructor (James Keach) does't want that to happen. It sars Bill's brother John Murray, Jennifer Tilly, Fred Willard, and Sally Kellerman. My only complaint is the fact that it's not worth the $'s. Why so expensive? The movie is not THAT good. Don't buy it for that price. Save your money. Just find a video store and rent it. It's worth a couple of dollars to watch once or twice."
3,"A good buy and they look great in the picture, but...","These are industrial strength HEAVY glassware! I have arthritic hands, and these were just way too much for me. I tried to return them, but the shipper who sells through amazon.com never respondeed. They sat in the entry hall waiting for a return shipping label until I finally got disgusted and (months later) gave them to a friend who has teenagers. They are a great buy, and they are good looking every day glasses, but.... just not for me. If I was the friend I gave them to, I'd give them five stars! But since they were way too heavy for me to use regularly, I only gave them three."
4,good,I love my glass set It was exactly what I wanted the quality is very good and I am pleased. The set was package in a way that broke two glasses other than that I am enjoying my glasses.
2,just ok for the low price.,"not crystal clear and so many scratch, just ok for the low price. I bought $12.99 Never buy this product again"
3,"great, but","Great glasses for the price, but 3 of them were broken. It's not worth my time so send them back."
3,Good but not great,"Jeff Bridges does another great job. What characters this guy can play(!), ""the dude"", Jagged Edge, Starman, Rooster Cogburn, (didn't see the country western singer he just played, but my wife said he was great). Jane Fonda reeks as an actress, but not too bad here. Probably her best role ever, in my opinion. Story line and character line is just too obvious, but somehow the modern L.A. noir captivated me. Two losers (one a small time actress with a drinking problem and the other a disabled cop from Bakersfield--or was it Fresno? with a past drinking problem) meet improbably and investigate a murder together. A murder it appears Fonda may have committed while in a drunken daze. Silly plot and circumstances, but honestly, good character play. Raul Julia--no one knows who he is today, but a great actor and plays a great role as Fonda's Ex. A lot of holes, but enough going on to make you watch it all the way through and say, ""not bad"" at the end."
4,Jane Fonda At Her Best!,"Jane Fonda was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in this movie. I do not recall now who else was nominated in 1986, but I cannot imagine that they did better than she does as a fragile alcoholic who wakes up in bed with a dead man and hasn't the foggiest idea how she got there. ""I once was an actress,"" she tells Jeff Bridges who plays an ex-cop who tries to help her. Both Bridges and Raul Julia, Fonda's exhusband and straight hairdresser-- one of the six in captivity-- both give adequate performances; but this movie belongs to Ms. Fonda. (We can only hope that she gets back into acting soon.)The film of suspense is directed by Sidney Lumet who gave us the great movies ""The Pawnbroker"" and ""Dog Day Afternoon."""
2,Wasted Premise,"This was an exciting premise, and when I saw Fonda, Bridges, and Lumet's name attached I watched this thinking it would be a forgotten gem. It starts off promisingly...Fonda wakes up next to a man with a knife in his chest. But it's downhill from there. Instead of a taught thriller, the movie digresses into far too much about the two main characters and becomes more of a character drama. It's not even interesting and completely loses focus. The things that happen (and far too few things happen) are unrealistic and disjointed. The plot developments (who is the killer) come way to late in the movie to be compelling in any way. Characters are introduced in the final act that really should have entered sooner to develop any real sense of surprise or suspense. The tone is uneven, even comical at times, which isn't helped by the inappropriate score. Strong performances don't save this mess."
4,A real treat,"Really impressed with Jane Fonda's portrayal of an over-the-hill actress. She is certainly not afraid to show a not always glamorous role, but the chemistry between her and Jeff Bridges is amazing."
2,Gimme a break,"Jane Fonda is a drunk down-and-out actress who wakes up one morning in bed next to a man with a knife sticking out of him. Jeff Bridges, an ex-police officer, helps her figure out what happened. I won't reveal it, but I found it difficult getting remotely interested in this movie."
2,This book was a dark portrayal of Jimi's life,"I didn't like reading this book too much because it showed a dark portrayal of Jimi's life. I know biographies should show both dark and light times of its subject but this one delved too far. With respect to Robert Johnson too, the author Charles Murray seemed to enjoy perceiving these two icons as doomed demons. It told too much about his own perception of Jimi and it does not honor Jimi enough. It is very detailed about the history of rock and roll and this does give the book some credibility yet for me, it was a difficult and unsatisfying read."
2,"Not a bio, a mildly interesting musical commentary","I got this book because it was one recommended in a list of Hendrix bios by someone, and was mostly disappointed. Only the second and third -- out of around 11 -- chapters cover Hendrix's life. Those chapters were well written and facinating although they just skimmed the surface.The other chapters are commentaries on the sixties, blues music, soul music, that are tangentially related to Hendrix's life and music. The commentaries were the kind that I find very boring and dated. Long discussions about how white America can or can't relate to the blues, whether Hendrix was a black musician crossing over or defined a whole new genre, etc. I tend to find such writing boring so I can't really judge it very objectively. If unlike me you like that kind of stuff you might like this book. However, if you are looking for a bio about Hendrix and his music there must be better ones around."
4,a lifestyle zeitgest,"The iPod is deceptively simple. It is true that when fully configured with your music tests, it is quite easy to use. But a lot of this operational simplicity is due to complexity being pushed off onto a Mac or PC. A large part of the book addresses the installation and usage of that software, in its interaction with your iPod. Which also includes the iTunes. The book's CD has a copy of the code. But the author correctly suggests that you consider downloading the newest version from Apple directly.The book has an amusing chapter on toys for the iPod. Basically, these are often fashion accessories. None are essential, but the iPod has tapped into a lifestyle zeitgeist echoed by the chapter. Like a MarWare SportSuit Safari case for the iPod. That looks like a mutant tribble."
2,Far inferior to the Rough Guide to iPods & iTunes.,"The iPod and iTunes Starter Kit by Tim Robertson is quite disappointing. While it is very long, it is far from exhaustive because of the superficial level its coverage of many important topics. The Rough Guide to iPods & iTunes is about a third of the price ($8.09 versus $23.09), but its treatment of such matters as compression codecs (MP3, AAC,and the like) is lucid, informative, and quite easy for a non-expert to follow. By contrast, Robertson's book is trite and formulaic in the way that many of the less helpful Dummies and Idiots books are. Bottom line: Don't waste your money - buy the excellent Rough Guide."
1,still the same & simply useless,"i said this before and am saying it again: this book is a waste of paper - let alone the energy it took to be produced.the content may serve the absolute beginner for maybe a few weeks - anyone searching for true information - for instance on such simple questions as how to authorize an ipod on several computers - is left in the dark. on top of that, 1/4th of the book is filled with additional purchase suggestions ('toys for your ipod'). not surprisingly, most of the index is also taken up by this backhanded advertising.unless you are looking for only the most basic information, save your money and go for another - any other! - guide. this book will become a dustcollector in no time; instead, the internet turned out to be a much better source..."
1,sent it back,"it looked like it would have a narrow powerful water stream. Not so, the stream was weak when adjusted to its strongest setting. I sent it back."
1,Plumbest should be Plumworst,This item is heavy duty-solid brass but when using it there is not enough water that comes through. I have plenty of water pressure so that is not the problem. I would not recommend this shower head to anyone!
4,Excellent book for seismic design of bridges,"Professor Priestley is No. 1 in the world when it comes to seismic design and retrofit of bridges. This book is a result of his extensive research conducted for Caltrans with Prof. Seible on bridge retrofit and their seismic behavior. The book is excellent reference for researchers and design engineers. The chapter about base isolations is very informative. Although I know that this is not his area, I wish he would elaborate more in chapter 3: seismicity and geotechnical considerations"
5,The Best,As a child growing up I loved watching this movie. It has everything for the whole family. Now that I have kids of my own I enjoy watching it with them too.
2,no educational information,I was very disappointed with this product.I was hoping to replace my President's placemat that was worn out. my old one had lots of useful info on the back side that corresponded to all the president's photos on he front.This one gives you very abbreviated notes about the Presidents -Only written below the photo.too bad. My old one was very educational.JFrey
4,Good product for a 3rd grader,"I got this product for my daughter in 2nd grade and she wasn't that interested at the time. Once she started studying presidents in 3rd grade, this placemat quickly became her favorite. She likes to quiz her parents on presidential trivia and enjoys feeling superior when we don't know the answers. The most recent president shown on the placemat is George W. Bush."
3,Not as good,"This placemat is not as informative as our other US Presidents placemat:U.S. Presidents Activity Placemat. The prices are similar, but the other placemat is much more informative.This placemat fulfills its number one job -- easy clean up. In addition to presidential portraits (colorized), it lists the years of each president's term, his party, birth date and death date, and vice president.Includes information on the constitutional eligibility to become president and the Oath of Office. So kids can practice!The back of the placemat is a repeat of all the presidential portraits, but this time in black and white and mixed up for a little quiz.We memorized all the presidents last month, using the ""Yo, Millard Fillmore"" method. One week -- sticky information. Yo Millard Fillmore!: (And all those other Presidents you don't know) [Paperback]"
4,Good educational placemat,"This placemat has the Presidents with their painting/photo, party, dates of birth, death and term, and Vice Presidents listed. The presidential oath of office and the qualifications for the President from the Constitution are included as well. On the other side are their pictures only, to provide a guessing game. I like this, but it isn't exactly what I was expecting. Growing up we had a similar placemat, but it also listed a few facts about the Presidents (at least First Lady, and I can't remember what else). This placemat does not have anything other than the basic information. It is still a good placemat and an interesting way to quiz at the lunch table. I don't know how durable these are as I just received them, but if they are as durable as they were when I was a child they should last quite a while before the seal on the laminate breaks down."
4,Things you never knew...,"Obviously for devout Madonna fans, this book is fun to read and even surprising (or not, given M's personality)..."
1,Bad for nursing moms,This book had really bad breastfeeding advice. I laughed my head off when it said that nursing moms shouldn't pump gas. No wonder some moms think breastfeeding is so difficult!
1,Waste of Money,"This book was very poorly written. First clue, its called Your Pregnancy but it is about after your baby was born-that makes no sense! Because it is a quick guide the author takes the liberty of writing full paragraphs in bulleted form. The sentences are incomplete and sometimes do not make sense. It is super repetative and yet not very helpful. I had to stop reading it after 10 pages because the editing was so horrible. Save your money and just read up in What to Expect: The First Year. MUCH better value for money spent."
1,Majors out of Minors,"Having read this work, Bernard attempts to make doctrine out of some very controversial verses. This is a major hermeneutical blunder. Moreover, he doesn't analyze Scripture with enough depth. I don't believe this gentlemen is purposely trying to deceive, but I do believe that he makes many assumptions and exegetical fallacies. A much more balanced book to read from another Oneness Pentecostal is ""Speaking in Tongues"", subtitled ""A Scholarly Defense"" by Barnett. Unfortunately the logical conclusion of Bernard's book is that the rest of Christianity is unsaved - this is an absurd conclusion."
1,Oneness private interpretation,"Readers will find that this book reflects the private interpretation of Oneness Pentecostal groups such as the United Pentecostal Church which is the largest of these groups. Sadly, most Oneness believers are not aware that Bernard's position that water baptism in Jesus' name and the baptism of the Holy Spirit evidenced by speaking in tongues are required for salvation and therefore constitute the new birth, was NOT believed by MANY prominent Oneness pioneers. Howard A. Goss was the first General Superintendant of the UPC which was formed by the merger of two Oneness Pentecostal groups in 1945. Goss taught, as did a very large percentage if the ministerial body of the UPC, that one was saved by faith and repentance BEFORE water baptism and the baptism of the Spirit with tongues. In agreement with Goss were Oneness Pentecostal pioneers Andrew Urshan, G.T. Haywood, John Paterson, and C.H. Yadon just to name a few. [...]"
5,Aylett tackles eternal issues,"In this mind blowing novel, Alix, a metaphysical assassin tells us about his attempt to kill God. Alix, his allies, and his opponents are all capable of moving etherealy through time and space, and this makes for some interesting action. Aylett's prose is eloquent but stripped down, so it is occasionaly hard to see what he's saying, but worth the effort. Aylett draws on a number of scientific, philosophical and spiritual traditions to create this world, and the questions that this book ispires are deep ones. The book is short and the print is large so this is a quick read. If you like books that deal with the metaphysical in an unusual way, you owe it to yourself to check this out."
4,A different type of travel guide,"This book is something different from Palahniuk, a view from his point of view about his town of Portland, Oregon. It's very different in the fact that he includes phone numbers and addresses for many of the places of interest that he speaks about, and between each ""chapter"" (rather categories of what to do) he includes a short peice he calls a postcard from the past, written at some point in his history in the city. All in all it's a good read, and something different but just as good from Palahniuk."
1,a puking bore,"As he writes in his epilogue, ""This is not Portland, Oregon."" Just scads of non-site-specific deegradation written in clipped New Yorker prose. Elliptical descriptions of perversion after perversion, spilling over the pages to become one big bore. And on top of all this, there's no index to the places he touches on, so even if you wanted to go there, you'd be hardput. Self-indulgent yet simultaneously unrevealing, as uninteresting a discovery of spirit of place as one can get."
3,"Oh, Chuck.","First off, when I got this they said it'd be in 'acceptable' condition, but it came with what looked to be a gnaw mark on the top right corner. It's ok, I can deal with that.Anyway, book was ok. I'm not a Palahniuk groupie, in fact I've only read two other books of his, so I can't really tell you comparatively or anything like that. It's a non-fiction about Portland. What can I say? It's a weird place. Book's kinda old so it may not still have some of those places he mentioned. Served to my wanderlust a bit and I still want to go, so I guess it didn't gross me out that bad. ;P"
4,A walk with the Devil,"Being a huge Palahniuk fan, this book was a definate pick-up. I wasn't sure how I would like him as a nonfiction writer but I guess it's safe to say that good writing is simply good writing. Portland seems to be a very interesting city and it's easy to see where Chuck is in fact a little bit of Portland himself. I was really more interested in his Postcards though, maybe to get a glimpse of Chuck personally. If your interested in visiting Portland I'd definately recommend this book. And if your a Palahniuk fan you have better already have this."
5,Still Totally Relevant,"Despite its age, this book is still quite astonishing. I have a little knowledge of llvm and gcc, and the information in this book is still seems to be as good as the day it was written. Variants of the tools mentioned still exist, and are still used for the same things. Other than mentioning languages such as FORTRAN throughout the chapters you wouldn't even know the age.There are lots of examples and problems to work through, but there aren't so many as to bore you with a single topic (this is not a math textbook). Be prepared to take your time reading this book, however, it isn't like many more modern CS books that tend to repeat themselves many times (leading to this book being compact)."
2,No better than a normal cotton one,"I'm disappointed by this headband. After a 30 minute bike ride, it was saturated and the sweat ran down my face. It did slightly diver the sweat but nothing like the product details states.Not sure if there is anything else out there but i tried the Halo II and was no more impressed."
3,Stretches out after one wear,"I have been having a difficult time finding a good headband for when I workout, most of them are too thin or won't stay in place. This one I wore once and it was already too loose to stay put. Might be ok to wear outside of working out but it just wasn't for me, especially not for the price."
3,Sweatvac Headband,HUGE and I have a big head. Like the color and it does absorb sweat well. Had to take it in so it would stay on my head during yoga!
4,"Sequel to ""Colin the Librarian""","This is the second of two books which tell the story of a meek librarian who is transported into a parallel universe dominated by swords and sorcery.The first book is called ""Colin the Librarian"" and as that title suggests, both books are parodies of the stories of ""Conan the Barbarian"".Krap the Conqueror being, of course, the muscle bound hero who fights to save Colin and his friends from the evil Thargs.If you find the names of these two books funny, you will probably find this book mildly amusing - probably not quite as entertaining as you may have hoped from the titles, but the books do have their moments.It wouldn't be entirely fair to dismiss this as a one-joke comedy. Nevertheless, if you don't think the titles particularly funny, or have never heard of ""Conan the Barbarian,"" then most of the jokes in this book will probably go straight past you."
1,Cost Effective Energy Savings?,"Given the Product Description says it is just ""1 inch"" long, it will only cost me about $1,680 to weatherstrip a single 3ft by 4 ft skylight hatch . . . maybe I should order the 1/2"" x 1/2"" stripping product instead that is also only 1 linear inch in length, so it will only cost about half as much!"
4,1+1=Kings of Convenience,"I bought this album after I heard ""I'd Rather Dance with You"" on a college radio station while I was cruising the coast of Delaware. It had a simple, very catchy formula, and I naturally prefer music with a folky feel these days. If simplicity is what you are looking for in an album, this is right up your alley. From the lyrics, to the music, to the harmonies themselves, sometimes you don't have to have all the ""bells and whistles"" to get an album right. It is clean, fresh, and pleasant to the ear. It's also pretty versatile. It's understated enough to not distract you as a background music, but catchy enough to keep your attention in regular rotation. Don't get me wrong, this is a good album, but if you want some folkish rock with a little ""swagger,"" I'd suggest Iron and Wine."
4,"Interesting indieacoustic,","...like they love to make the sense of intimacy stronger than you'd like to admit at first, they wipe off all what stands for separation between tunes - rhythm.All these small minimalistic guitar tappings with hammer onoff makes the main melody melt into the soft voice of our very Kings. This album is also a bit of a classical Convenience-art, aftercoming albums influenced by this creates follow-ups, but nothing can be ripped off in this state of acoustic music: really tempting, close, working out the intimacy a hundred procent.What could be judged whatsoever might be the distance from trying to explore - a couple of the songs are mainly floating by like streams hidden troughout the track setting. Good job, though!! Recommendation for spring / summer =)"
5,Dreamy Minstrals,"These guys are wonderful. Ive had the album for two weeks and have played it non-stop. If you are more ""Iron and Wine"" inclined, this is an album for you. Sweet harmonies that bring ""Simon and Garfunkel"" to mind and poppy vocals not heard since ""Nick Drake's Bryter Layter."" Im so glad I have this in my collection, Also, Lesie Feist adds a jazzy touch to this album that I adore. A must buy chillin' out album!"
4,"It's a ""Buy It"" album. Better than their first one.","This is a great cd. Not a 5 (this is no White Album or Purple Rain), but certainly a 4. The lyrics are better crafted. The use of bossanova sounds and upbeat rhythms add a fun layer to their style. The two seem more comfortable with writing songs in English.Having Leslie Feist was a brilliant idea to contribute to ""Know How"". The three voices blend so well in the song, you'd think they've been singing together for ages. Other standouts are ""Homesick"", ""Misread"", ""Love is No Big Truth"", and ""I'd Rather Dance With You"" (a song I didn't like at first, but gets better with each listen).One big criticism: I could have done without the trumpet in the end of ""Sorry or Please"". I hear Erlend is self-taught. It sure sounds like it.Otherwise, this is a very good album. I rate it a Buy It."
3,Please do not compare this music to John Mayer...,"as the Kings of Convenience sound nothing like him. This is a good record, but not the place to start with Kings of Convenience. ""Quiet is the New Loud"" would be an adequate starting point. I read a lot of reviews on Amazon and rarely post anything myself, but I had to after reading the John Mayer comparison. Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Cat Stevens, Nick Drake...these are staples for which to compare modern singer songwriter types, not John Mayer. That is like comparing a great early nineties songwriter, such as E or even Chris Isaak, to Bryan Adams, Huey Lewis or Daryl Hall & John Oates. John Mayer has obtained acknowledgement from sounding exactly like an extremely less talented Dave Matthews, and really, Matthews has only put out one truly great album himself. Kings of Convenience deserve comparison to Simon & Garfunkel, Nick Drake, Fairport Convention from the past, and comparison to Ben & Jason, Trembling Blue Stars and Iron & Wine in the present."
3,A Nondescript Follow-Up,"I greatly enjoyed the Kings' debut album, _Quiet is the New Loud_. That album featured songs that were intimate and introspective, yet memorable and well-developed. In contrast, the songs on _Riot on an Empty Street_ seem more fragmented. I suspect that this is merely a sophomore slump, and that we'll have more to look forward to from this unique duo in the future."
3,pleasent but dull,"I bought this becasue i heard good things about it and it was compared to nick drake, simon and garnfunckel and i really like folk music. This is a pleasent cd very relaxing but very dull. I really cant remeber any songs from this it all sounds the same. For one thing the duos voices is very evenilly match unlike simon and garnfucnkle when one had the better voice then the other one and it blended well together. if you like this music try out belle and sebastain the songs are good and a rareity now of days in music the lyrics are very good as well."
4,Riot on an Empty Street,"Okay, let us get real people, the only similiarities between Simon and Garfunkle and the Kings of Convenience are that they both use acoustic guitars and sing in triads. Honestly, that's about it. Moving on to the album...it's good, quite good in fact. That's all I have to say, and it should be enough considering the fact that this comment came from me, a rather fickle pickle."
3,Okay if you are 30 something,"KOC- are a mellow, pop,jazzy band, their cd is great for relaxing with friends, or traveling down the road lost in your own thoughts. 3*'s Brad from N.C."
5,Giardinelli GTR 512,"This is my favorite trumpet. I've been playing trumpet for 14 years. My wife bought this for me on my birthday, but in Black Lacquer. Best Horn, especially for the price. Can't find a professional quality horn for this price, plus the tone is just awesome. A nice dark tone, probably because of the great Giardinelli mouthpiece that comes with it. In my opinion, if you're looking for an inexpensive professional horn, this is the way to go."
3,Sacred Review,"I found the game fun, ive only played it in Bronze mode so far but i have leveled my char to 55 so far. ill do Silver next."
1,Sacred in General,"The game Sacred was, in my opinion, a very boring game. I bought this game because of the good reviews it had gotten and how it was much related to Diablo II: LOD. I used to play Diablo II when I was about 10 so I decided to buy the game. I wouldn't be able to relate Sacred to Diablo II in anyway. I only played single player so I am not sure about the multiplayer game play for Sacred, but after playing the single player I don't think I would want to anyway. I may not like this game because I have gotten used to Guild Wars, but Sacred it not at all as fun as Diablo II."
4,Raising the standard for RPGs,"Sacred Gold Edition raises the standard for RGPs. The game has a large layout with a variety of terrain, scenery, foes, and hidden secrets to discover. Additionally, the game features many side quests and challenging foes to defeat. Although it fails in comparison, I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Diablo."
3,"Actually, pretty good.","I saw this movie years ago on HBO, and didn't quite understand it. It centers around two wind-up toy mice. A mouse and his child. The father mouse speaks in a monotone voice that may possibly drive you up a wall. Anyway, they end up on a journey to become independent and self winding. During their travels they run into Manny the Rat, who uses toys especially wind-ups, to do his dirty work. A very interseting, and funny part is Manny the Rat crashing the theatrical production and starts to recite some heavy vocabulary until getting hit in the head with a tomato. Will Manny get his? Will the mice conquer? Some interseting things to look at in this film: Forgiving, A fathers wisdom, love, and little life lessons that we all can pick up on. Pretty good animation too. Youngsters may not sit through it all, but it's a good film to have in your collection."
5,Please put this on DVD I beg you,"This is one of many forgotten animated movies I loved when I was a kid. It came on once on HBO, my mom was lucky enough to record it for me and I couldn't help but shed tears on almost all through the movie. Through the joyful scenes and its dark ones The Mouse and His Child is a perfect movie cult classic. But it bugs me on why isn't this wonderful movie on DVD? A lot of ohter ones I know are well most of them are on DVD already and not seeing this one on a DVD of it's own breaks my heart. I wish to own it again since I lost the tape and I don't have a VSH player anymore. So whoever company it's under please! Be smart put this on a DVD it will sell like hot cakes."
1,Vile.,"Pretty Persuasion is anything but pretty. I was only interested in this film because I think Evan Rachel Wood is a natural talent. Her performance in this film is great but the movie is a total disaster. I just couldn't stand how calculated and lifeless this film was, tries to come off as a clever satire but doesn't work on any level. Some of the dialogue and overtly sexual nature seemed forced. I did not laugh once and could not wait for this ""dark comedy"" to be over, avoid this stinker at all costs!"
4,"Evan Rachel Wood, Stark Sands, in a decent dark comedy","This is a decent little dark comedy. Very funny at times, and sometimes very strange.This film's strong points are Evan Rachel Wood, of ""Thirteen"" and Stark Sands, of ""Die mommie, die"" and ""11:14.""Stark has a meaty role in Clint Eastwood's ""Flag of our fathers"" coming fall, 2006. He is a wonderful actor, and on the verge of breaking out big-time."
4,"Unsetling, Funny, but not original","First off the best thing about this film is Evan Rachel Wood. Her acting is amazing she makes Kimberly come alive, giving her depth even when the script didn't. It is worth seeing the film if only for her. The second best thing about this film is James Woods. I laughed at almost everything he did, and hated myself for doing it. His performance is akin to a more inappropriate, and with no redeeming features, Alan Arkin in ""Little Miss Sunshine."" The last best thing about this film is the script. Intricate, and often offensive the script is a fantastic, though as has been noted by other reviewers, not very original. The movie steels plot devices from other teen movies, and unfortunately it does it a little too much. The movie is not great but certainly worth watching. Evan Rachel Wood is the best thing about this film, and she elevates it from foulmouth comedy, to dark social commentary."
1,I bought it with a gift card and still think I got ripped off,"I paid $3.00 for this 110 minutes of brain cell destroying material. This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made. Horrible script that has not a single likable character. I really don't know what to say about this movie. I would not recommend it, I hope parents don't let their kids watch it and I am sorry I watched it. Now, if you want a free copy just find the dumpster that I am about to deposit it in."
1,The only reason to see this movie is Evan Rachel Wood....,"... who's radiant and great and really makes an admirable effort with the material, even though the script is tone-deaf, smug, obvious, contrived and trying way too hard to be shocking.Listening to the author's hamfisted, heavy-handed, wrong-headed attempts at satire is like listening to a guitarist play with strings that are all out of order and out of tune.The only reason this film rates any comparison at all to ""Heathers"" or ""Lord Love a Duck"" is because it really wants to be the '05 version of those dark little classics.The film's main inspiration, though, is clearly Alexander Payne's ""Election."" The only problem is ""Election"" -- with its brilliant, dead-on combination of Stanley Kubrick and John Hughes -- doesn't need a little sister, especially one of ""Persuasion's"" synthetic ilk. If you watched this and thought it was good, see ""Election,"" because you're in for a better, bitter little treat."
4,Good,"I ordered this as a Christmas present for my 11 year old violinist son who just graduated to a full size violin. This is a good, decent product, as advertised -- nothing fancy about it. It's a suspension case that comes with a hygrometer, humistat, string tube (wasn't in the advertisement), two bow holders, velcro neck restraint, blanket and accessory pocket inside the canvas outer music pocket. It's a lot lighter than my son's previous case, so that's a plus. I ordered the Bobelock's backpack style V-Strap separately, because I know my son would love it. It should have come with the case, though."
3,Fine,"I have no problems to report. Product is as expected. Overpriced, but was necessary for my instrument."
4,"Good Changer, Great Picture Quality, Great Price, Terrible Interface","Since there are so many mixed reviews on this changer, I read almost everything there is about this unit before buying it. My main problem was that I was running out of room for all of my DVDs and I was considering buying some shelves or a cabinet, then I realized the storage would cost almost as much as a changer. The 2 main problems with the unit are the autoplay and the disc explorer. I solved these issues by leaving the unit on (it's energy star compliant) so it doesn't play a disc everytime I turn it on. As for the disc explorer, I don't use it. I use a cheat sheet and DVD Profiler (a WONDERFUL free program for organizing your movies). Like I said, these are the 2 main complaints, no one ever complains about the picture quality, or the price. Also... I have 2 of these units now."
1,Not ready for prime time - Don't buy this machine.,"Don't buy this unit. As many others here have written:The user interface is awful - terrible design.Takes a long, cumbersome time to enter titles.And tonight IT JUST DUMPED ALL THE TITLES THAT I SPENT SO LONG ENTERING. All I did was turn it on and press Folder. Screen said loading, stuck there. Turned unit off and back on; No Titles. I am not happy.I've had it less than 30 days, so I'm just returning it for refund.Sony does not deserve to be getting anyone's money for something with such apparent, consistent flaws."
2,Doesn't always play,"I purchased this player a year ago. I am on my 4th one, having returned the first to due to the fact that it was completely broken and would not play at all, and the other 3 for the same problem described below.This player does work, but the problem is, it doesn't play all DVD's. It will freeze up and take 20 minutes to move 2 frames. The DVD's that I am using are in excellent condition as I am a fanatic when it comes to them. I have had this issue on brand new DVD's as well as older ones.I do not see the scratches that other owners have complained about, and when I take the DVD's out and use them on other machines they play fine.I am very disappointed with the quality of Sony at this stage of the game. I'm not looking to do anything special with my DVD player, I am simply looking for what should be a basic function of a player, TO PLAY DVD's."
4,We're Enjoying Ours,"We've had this model from Sony since Christmas 08. We've noticed few of the problems noted by other reviewers. Our DVDs remain unscratched, it doesn't make a lot of noise, nor is it particularly difficult to set up. The only time we have lost DVD title data has been during prolonged power outages (3+ hours).Pros: Holds 400 DVDs and accesses them directly with little difficulty. Playback is as sharp and crisp as I have grown used to with other players. Unlike mentioned in an earlier review, it does allow multiple units to be attached through a 3 position switch on the back of the player and in the battery case of the remote.Cons: Loading is a bit cumbersome. As is getting title data in for most DVDs. It is madness not to connect a PS2 keyboard to this device. Inputting data with the remote for 400 disks would drive the most stable person right over the edge.I'd buy another, in fact, I probably will within the next 3 months."
1,Junk product. Loses all stored data.,"I was happy initially, entered 200 DVD/CD information and it lost all stored information twice. All data gone at two different time span. just shows ""?"".Switch on the DVD player and it starts playing the DVD/CD (should let user to push the play button).This product is junk. Waste of money and time."
1,Very Disappointed.,"With all the complaints about ALL the previous versions of the Sony DVD Changers regarding usability, I was hoping Sony would get it right this time. The Disc Explorer is only slightly improved. For example, the title is no longer limited to 16 or so characters. However, when Auto Start is turned off, you still have to wait for the player to go grab the previously viewed DVD. Arrgh. This has been a complaint for so long it almost appears Sony just doesn't care. Also, there is no facility to access a DVD by number. I don't want to scroll through 300+ titles to get to the one I know is in slot 366.Video and Audio quality are very good. Since that is not the purpose of this beast, I didn't consider those aspects in the rating. After all, I can get those features for much less money."
3,"Go Idea, but it needs some iprovement","unit is very delicate, I just moved it over and all my DVD's unseated causing the player to jam. I had to remove all 312 DVD's to remove the one that jammed!!!! I mean I just pushed the unit over slightly!"
4,Great Machine,"No one's perfect but this is close. This equipment solves storage issues and I found it to be easier to handle than what I read. Alot of issues are minor and solved by reading other reviews. The price is great, entering names was not a four hour process, the machine is a lot faster switching and the quality of sound and picture is fine. It you want more spend 750 and get another machine that does the same thing. Disc loading names isn't the machines fault as are some of the other issues mentioned. Read the manual and have fun with this great solution."
3,Not up to sony standards,"I was excited to finally get rid of the 200 audio CD holders and 40 DVD jackets laying around. When I received the unit, it took me longer than it normally does for me to master the product. The instruction manual was a little weak for this type of unit.It did not upload very many of the CD's info so I finally plugged in one of my old keyboards and was able to type in the missing titles and artists. This is a very good feature.After all this, I was a little disapointed in the time it takes to locate and read a CD before playing.The quality of the picture is great. I used HDMI for the vidio and gold connectors for the links to my tuner."
4,Great DVD changer Bad CD player,"I am happy with the performance of the Sony DVPCX995V 400-Disc DVD Mega Changer/Player as a DVD changer/player. However, I bought this equipment with the idea of combining some of my DVD's with some of my Cd's. As a CD player this machine is woeful. You can not skip tracks or replay a track. The entire CD must be restarted in order to hear a particular track repeated. I use this machine solely as my DVD changer and purchased a CD changer to play music. As a DVD changer it has performed flawlessly. It does take some time to load a DVD. But, it allows me to keep all of my DVD's from being handled, or even borrowed!"
4,Couch Potato's Dream,"I'm on my third and last Sony disc explorer! (Sony DVPCX995V 400-Disc DVD Mega Changer/Player)This four hundred DVD carousel player, though not perfect, is a great way toOrganize and play a large DVD collection. Up to three of these massiveplayers can be controlled by a single (included) remote. Through the HDMIoutput these units will up-convert standard DVDs to HDTV and will doprogressive scan. Over all I am very pleased with my Sony carousel playersfor ease of access and not searching some sort of filing system to find ashow then move it to a single DVD player.I only wish I could get something like this for Blu-ray!"
3,Wait for the next generation,"My friends had this player and it seemed like a great idea- I was told I could sort through my collection by title/genre- I didn't know you couldn't create your own genre's, (as the list is fairly incomplete) and I didn't know that the order you enter the DVDs is it- it won't sort alphabetically which would be a nice feature....if the DVD has a preprogrammed title- you can't edit it- so for special edition DVDs with more that one DVD per movie, this creates a problem...it works fine and is easy to use, but I am sure the next generation will be a little more user friendly in sorting...."
2,Mega Disappointment,I purchased it for my sons movies. It doesn't play all my discs. Even new discs. Those same discs play on other players. Aggravating to find a discs with Sony remote. The biggest complaint is it WILL NOT FIT in a media cabinet. It is too long to fit. Mine is sitting in the closet. Don't waste your money.
4,pretty good,"Not a bad product by any means, a few flaws that i found include the slow scroll speed (probably a mem thing) and the inability to load only a few discs at a time. each time you add something new you must re-load the entire collection to access and add info to the new discs. the keyboard input is a must. out of the first 180 discs i loaded, maybe 20 found the info. w/out the keyboard it wouldn't be worth it. good deal for a good product."
3,Almost everything eye wanted,"What I liked about the unit:Easy to installExcellent soundHuge capacitySwitches between DVD & CD automaticallyGr8 price and free shipping from AMAZONWhat I did not likeTakes couple of minutes when it chages discsHas hard time reading and displaying info on CD'showever it can use ur pc's keyboard for quicktitle entrySomewhat difficult to load, disc slots are very narrowand too close together.I replaced a Pioneer 100 disc analog carousel, whichhad a random select function, that changed disceafter every song...the Sony does not do this, itrequires writting a new program everytime I play CD'sI am always with Amazon service and quick shipping.Stephen Cohen-Hollywood, FL"
3,lemonade out of lemons,"To circumvent a major drawback in Sony's design, mainly the lack of cataloging feature, the slowness of browsing using the explorer, the lack of a back up feature for the titles, and the tediousness of the data input. One can combine this hardware, along with a computer software, such as ""Movie Collector"" (google it) to effectively catalog your features. By inputing the name of the movie into the software database, the application automatically downloads the available front and back covers, along with movie info into the computer. If one loads the Sony according to the software database, all one has to do is look for the feature and its apropriate # on the computer, and then dial it in on the Mega Changer. Eliminating the need for wasteful tinkering. The above software can hold over 400 titles, has a print ability, as well as a 'lending' tracker. It also has a free trial version. I'm sure there are other applications similar to that."
4,Sony DVPCX995V 400 Disc DVD Mega Changer/Player,"This Mega Changer/Player is everything that Sony says it is. My only gripe was my computer key board did not work with this one as it did with the Sony 300 disc Mega Changer so I had to use the remote to enter all my DVD's and CD's. That took a couple of days, but once that was done, this machine performed flawlessly. It is very simple to operate, the folder is easy to read, and no more DVD/CD racks on the wall. I would definately purchase this Sony again."
5,NICE,Very convienient to use tough to put all the titles in but Ive already filled it up and am looking at getting a new one!
5,"So far so good, almost 6 years old",I purchased my Sony DVP-CX995V 5-26-07 from Circuit City. I've had zero problems with it. It replaced their 300 mega changer which lasted about 5 years before acting up. I went online thinking about buying another one until I saw the prices. I thought electronics always went down in price. I paid less almost 6 years ago for a new one than the lowest price I saw for used ones today. It's been a great unit so far.
1,A wasted money.,"A great disappointment from Sony. In about year or so it suddenly died without any warnings. Just like many reviewers I had the same problem. It shows reading the disc then displays the message it cannot read, and changes over to the next disc only to repeat the same problem, then cycles endlessly. At this state of the quality that this product represents, shouldn't cost more than $45. $380 for one year is too mulch money to waste when it almost guarantees that it will die in one year."
3,Short life,If you watch a fair amount of movies this player will not live long. It is great for having all your movies together where the kids and myself will not have to handle them. We have been through 3 of these and are now back to movies in cases.
1,This unit will destroy your disks,"I purchased one of these kinds of players a few years ago (not from Amazon) and it mars your discs. It's essentially a large ""jukebox"" and it has a device that grabs or selects your disk. In doing so it grips the disk to place it in a slot for playing and in doing so leaves a deep mark on it. Eventually the marks get larger and some of the disks become unplayable until you have to resurface or repair them.Save yourself a great deal of trouble and aggravation and get a regular carousel type player. Sony needs to re-engineer this device and perfect it before I ever buy another one."
5,Sony delivers,I have had this machine for 2 years with no problems. The picture quality is great and works very well with my HDTV. I love having all my movies at my fingertips and not having to sort through hundreds of cd cases to find one I want to watch. We have a Logitech Harmony RemoteLogitech Harmony 880 Advanced Universal Remote Controlso it pulls up all the movies on a guide that is easy to use. I would recommend this machine for anyone that buys movies and watches them over and over again like we do.
4,Sony DVPCX995V 400-Disc DVD Mega Changer/Player,"Much improved over the previous models, Sony listened tocriticism about slow performance, ease of use, etc.But is still complex for some users.Overall, I am pleased and would recommend."
3,Could be easier to use.,"I bought this thinking it was going to be the best piece of my A/V setup. I could finally consolidate my 370 DVDs in one place! Well, it does consolidate but it's pretty cumbersome to use. The thing that drives me crazy the most is that it starts playing the last DVD as soon as it turns on and you cannot stop it until after it loads and starts to play. It will drive you insane! BTW, this thing is huge! I had to cut out the back of my entertainment center for it to fit. I wish I didn't buy this item."
4,Sony DVPCX995V 400 DVD Changer,"So far I am happy with the performance of the DVPCX995. It is a bit of a technological nightmare, but works very well. It is a matter of figuring out the menus, entering titles, etc. However, it simply takes some patients and the manual. It is slow to change when set on shuffle ALL DISCS, but obviously it is searching through 400 discs times 15 to 20 tracks. The last thing I will mention, is that you must have it plugged into a tv to operate it properly. You cannot just use it as a cd player without hooking it to a TV, as the only way to access the menu is on screen. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase, and I would recomend this product to anyone who who like to have 400 cds available at the push of a button. JW"
4,Works as advertised . . .clunky interface,"This player works fine for my audio CD library, although it fails to read the information on audio CDs . . .requiring an extensive effort in entering in titles and artists via a computer keyboard. I have delayed doing this after hearing that in some cases the player loses this memory. I was dissappointed to find that the player does not diplay information about the media on the player itself . . .you have to have the TV on to see this. Since I use it primarily for audio I don't turn the TV on when I am using it."
3,It would not read DVD title for most discs,"It performs most of it's functions correctly but what I do not like is that it would not load most of my original DVD titles. Somebody said it's DVD manufacturer's fault not recording the title. I'd say even if DVD manufacturer did not put the title info, it should atleast read the DVD volume, which is what you see in your PC (check the My Computer section). All those DVDs whose title is not shown in the DVD changer, show the title information when I put in my PC DVD drive. It's not big deal. I'd say Sony should release firmware update to fix this issue.I have already lost all the title details for my 250 DVDs when there was power outage for few minutes. Sony claims it retains the title info for 30 days in case of power disruption."
3,Disc information system does not work well,"After loading DVD information on 143 DVD's after a couple of months, the unit freezes up with a box saying ""LOADING"". I finally get it to power off and when I turned it back on, none of the disc information was there.Apart from that, this is an amazing DVD player."
5,Exactly what I expected,If you have a large collection of DVD's this is the only machine there is. The disk explorer does leave a lot to be desired but as I have read in other reviews I have made a list and refer to it. One of my personal worries was the shear size of the unit and turns out it just barley did fit in the space I had for it. If I had it to do over again I most certainly would and for the price how can you go wrong.
4,Sony 400 Disc Player,"I have both the DVPCX995V and the earlier version of the same machine. I am using them on a HD 63"" TV. Picture quality is outstanding for both it is difficult to tell the dif between the 1080i for the 995v or the 480p for the older. Buy a cheap key board to enter info to the DVD text entering & searching is primitive. Create a document on your computer to keep track of title & location. For the price these are the greatest things since sliced bread. As my DVD collection grows I will puy another. If your space is limited watch the size these are very deep units."
1,2 yrs and DVDs wont play,"As in other reviews I found entering disc information less than easy. Then one day all entered info was gone. Re entered disc info again. Now after just 2 years, Mfg date Jan 2008, it won't read dvds. It still plays cds. I found some online forums and others are having the same issue. Something about the laser only lasting so many hrs and also a diode that goes out. Sony is no help big phone bank of ""tech"" people that read from a list of suggestions and then when they finally are convinced your unit can't be reset they offer you an exchange for $275 you pay shipping one way,and a 90 day warranty. refurbished, not new. The phone calls took hrs. I paid $300 new in Feb 08 for this,the price is up over $400 so I think I will go back to a single unit good quality (not Sony) unit. Think of all the calories I'll burn changing the discs. Next plan will be a server, all digital computer based."
1,Catastrophic Failure,"If you purchase this product, I recommend an extended warrantee. I have has mine for a year and a half and suddenly after starting to read a DVD it failed and tried to read each subsequent DVD in turn and failing with each until I powered it off. When I moved the DVDs to a second and older changer, Sony's 875P, they all played with no problem. The problem does not appear to be mechanical or due to dust/dirt but rather a failure in the electronics. Eighteen month to failure is very short considering Sony's reputation. Of course the warrantee is one year and the cost of the exchange program is almost as much as buying a new one."
3,Memory Dump,"I just wanted to go on record that my unit functions properly or I thought it did until today. It has never auto-started the last DVD played until this morning. I turned on the unit and was mystified that it started playing a movie. I stoped the disc, pressed the folder button and was surprised, no make that horrified, to see nothing but question marks on all entires. All 371 dvd titles had disappeared. No power outage, no accidental unplugging. Normal shutdown. I have had the player since 12/25/05 and everything has been great until today. I won't be calling Sony as previous reviews have indicated that that process is even more frustrating than the problems with the DVD changer.I am going to miss having the titles in memory. I really liked being able to sort by Title, actor, genre.....blah blah... Fortunately I do have an Access database with all titles and even the slot number on the changer.I do believe tht I will start a letter writing campaign to Sony. It has worked before for me."
3,Defective CD/DVD 400-Disc Player,"This particular Sony CD/DVD Player, model #DVP-CX995V, will not play copies of software or other DVDs. I have tried 3 new models and none will work. Nobody seems to know why. I have two other Sony DC/DVD upconvert players (single and 5-disc) that play the copies very well. The copy software company has no solution for this problem. Sony is still trying to help find a solution"
4,GARY,"GREAT PRODUCT NICE TO HAVE 400 DVDS IN ONE PLACE.I READ ALL REVIEWS SO I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM PRODUCT,THEY WERE A GREAT HELP BEFORE I PURCHASED PLAYER SO CHECK REVIEWS !!THEN ORDER ONE FOR YOURSELF."
3,Not bad for the price...,This device seems to work pretty well. The things I don't like are that its a real time consuming hassle entering DVD information. Few of my disks even autoload the title. I plugged in a keyboard and it helped getting titles in for a little while. Then the keyboard connection quit working and I was back to using the remote. It retrospect I would spend a little more and get a friendlier product...
4,The best solution at this time,"This is my second DVPCX995V machine due to the fact that the first one is almost full. Although the interface on these machines can be a bit quirky and somewhat counterintuitive it is really the best choice if you want your movies at your fingertips and have no intention of rifling through hundreds of DVDs in a bookcase or a box to find the one you want to see. The truly huge plus of this machine is minimizing the handling of delicate and scratch prone DVDs, load them once and forget it. It is also easy to find a movie either by title or genre with the disc explorer feature. The 1080p unconverting is truly excellent. The picture that is sent to my new 58"" Plasma is mindboggling. Until they make a bluray jukebox player that can hold as many discs this is your machine."
4,"Excellent player, Storage is a bonus","I now own three of these units.When you own as many movies as I do, space becomes a problem. With the storage unit along with Sony quality, this is a must for collectors.Convenience and quality should go hand in hand.I call it ""my dvd juke box""."
3,not that great,"we got this thinking it would save us from having to change the dvds all the time, well it is a PAIN. complicated to set up, almost none of our dvd titles were detected by the machine meaning they had to be entered by hand...took FOREVER and if you take it out to play in another room or the car it has to be reenter. the machine is also so slow when changing from one dvd to another. over all i would not recommend this changer."
5,GREAT DVD/CD PLAYER,THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST DVD PLAYERS I HAVE EVER SEEN THE ON SCREEN MENU IS THE BEST FOR SCROLLING THROUGH ALL YOUR DVD'S TO HIND THE ONE YOU WANT WHEN YOU ARE UNDESIDED ON WHAT MOVIE YOU WANT TO WATCH AND ALL THE HI DEF HOOK UP ARE GREAT AND THE FIBER OPTICS FOR THE SURROUND SOUND. THIS PLAYER HAS EVERYTHING YOU WILL EVER NEED AND WONT NEED TO BE UPDATED FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
3,"Great output, Horrible user interface","BIG. Wow.Great picture though.The user interface for this product is shallow and poorly engineered. Did they do _any_ testing? I cannot believe there isn't an ethernet interface. After all, the premise is that I will put my collection of over 200 DVD's into the box, right? Well, can you imagine having to type in that many titles? Not to mention other information. The built-in ""load"" function which is supposed to read the title information works for about 1 out of every 5 DVD's.All in all, I'd say the user interface makes this box NOT worth buying. Given all the beautiful Sony products out there they could have done better and it's obvious that they just didn't want to spend the money.Did I mention that it's big?"
2,Not so impressed with product,"I own many Sony products and have generally been happy with them. This one does not make the list. It is difficult to use, with a very confusing user manual. I called Sony. The person was very courteous but not knowledgeable. I felt I was teaching him more than he was teaching me.Also, the company that sold it to me has no technical support at all, which I did not know, until after the fact. I should have read their policy first."
1,Aaauuugghhh!,"I hate this thing. I've had this player for a while, hoping that I would never have to worry about loading disks in and out of a dvd player. Boy was I wrong.The time it takes to enter the info for all the DVDs that don't have it on the disk is painful. Then you get to do it every time the power goes out?The system also started moving my movies around on the carosel. I was leaving buffer space between different types of movies so I could leave room for growth. The player does not put the DVD back into it's original slot, no, it puts it in the first available empty slot.Brosing the movies is pretty tough too. It's a clunky interface that could have been done much better. It takes quite a bit of time to look through your collection five movies at a time. Sony should get some of their MP3 player software engineers involved and redesign the entire interface.I would sum this device up as frustrating!"
2,Not a happy camper!,"I'm not the pro that most of the other writers are. Having purchased a unit before Xmas I find the return policy reads something like - ""just return the item - we may return half of what you paid"".Now the problem! Page 7 of Sony manul # 2-592-134-13(2) should be part of the advertisment. This one page INFORMS you of whats acceptable and not acceptable when coping DVD's. I have a great number of events/pic copied from our TV and a large VSH collect thats been tranfered to DVD. I'm too darn old to start this project over. Thank You Sony and Amazon for all the time and money spent on the project.Sony DVPCX995V 400-Disc DVD Mega Changer/Player"
2,Take my review with a grain of salt,"Ok - so here is my history. I have owned 4 sony dvd jukeboxes over the past 5 years. The first was a 200 disc, the second was the 301 (flippable) disc and 2 400 disc (the 985 and 995) models. The 301 version had the best functionality - compact design and it flipped the disc for you (this was great when you have a double-sided disc). However, this model had a notorious history of misfeeding and even jamming. The 985 model is great (but no flipping). The 995 model is extremely slow. I have the 985/995 side-by-side and the difference in speed is huge.I hope in the near future, sony releases the flip version again."
3,"SONY,THIS TIME YOU DIDNT HAVE YOUR THINKING CAP ON","I WOULD HOPE THAT A BIG AND WELL KNOWN COMPANY SUCH AS SONY WOULD HAVE BETTER ENGINEERING AND DESIGN WHEN OFFERING A PRODUCT LIKE THE 400 DISC CD/DVD CHANGER.INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO ENTER A DISC # AND DIRECT ACCESS TO THAT DISC,SONY CHOSE TO USE A""SCAN"" SYSTEM THAT IS TEDIUS AND TIME CONSUMING BY PUSHING A SINGLE BUTTON TO SEARCH FOR THE DISC NEEDED.....STUPID! GREAT PRICE,GREAT SOUND....DUMB ENGINEERS! MY RATING:5 TERRY LINTON,BULLHEAD CITY,AZ"
2,Sony ain't what it use to be,"In short I loved this device eventhough the muening system sucks. BUT, after a year it stopped working, I've got 250 DVD's installed and it can't READ ONE. What a waste..............Added: 9-2009I know you all know this but don't EVER put a disc in this unit that has a PAPER Label. I did (actually I didn't know it was paper until it was to late) and it wrecked the unit."
1,Would not recommend this product,"This unit has some serious memory issues. Just got two of these products and lost all of the titles after one week of operation, on one of the units. Sony Tech Support, at the first level, told me simply re-enter all the information. There is no way that I will go through this unless Sony comes up with a fix. This problem has nothing to do with power loss since the units are connected to a UPS. A UPS should not be required anyway since the memory is supposed to non-volatile. The players have some firmware problem that mess up memory intermittently.I am in discussions with Sony to elevate this issue and to come up with a firmware fix."
1,Don't do it,I purchased the Sony 400 disc mega changer just over a year ago. It worked OK for awhile and it has a lot of nice functions but shortly after the warranty expired the unit stopped reading discs properly then it stopped reading altogether. We took good care of the unit while it worked but you can only shine a turd for so long before it stinks. Sony offered to graciously repair the unit for $270. I declined and choose to go back to more dependable and less expensive options. Don't be fooled by the attractive price and functions this unit is built like a Turd.
3,Great until the new Sony DVD copy protection came out,"This is a really great unit & I love not having the kids handle the DVDs - but be aware that the new crop of movies being released by Sony in spring 2007, (Stranger Then Fiction, Casino Royale, etc) have a new copy protection on them that is so tough Sony's own DVD players can't play them!Supposedly there is a software patch being created....we'll see, but for now I am really angry"
3,DVD CD storage unit,"The player is really slooowww. If you aren't patient avoid this player. If you don't mind taking a minute or more to change a DVD and taking another minute or two to redo what you did because you hit the wrong button, then get it. It doesn't have DVD title search without a TV so you have to turn the TV on to find which DVD you want to eject. The unit is also really deep about a 1-2 inches deeper than my other componets, besides that it not to bad."
5,best ever,"The Sony 400 is the most unique system I have ever purchased. It has all of the easy to use features that one looks for in a product of this kind. If you want top quality and ease of use, you can't go wrong with this one. Thanks Amazon and SonyMike D."
1,Warning -- Risk of serious scratching of DVDs,Warning: These multi-disc changers from SONY scratched $200 of my DVD's. Buy at your own risk but the unit I purchased from Amazon has ruined many DVDs with arc-shaped scratches running from the outside of the disc inward. You risk ruining your DVD collection with these multi changers. The added convenience is not worth the risk. Deserves negative stars.
1,scratches Discs-BEWARE!,"I OWN 3 OF THESE UNITS. A SHORT WHILE AGO MY DISCS STARTED TO FREEZE UP. I INSPECTED THEM AND FOUND THEY WERE ALL SCRATCHED , AT THE SAME PLACE, ABOUT .5"" FROM THE OUTER EDGE. ALL MY DISCS ARE RUINED! ALMOST 1200 OF THEM. I TRIED TO NOTIFY SONY ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND GOT NOWHERE. I TRIED THE CD/DVD REPAIR KITS, BUT THEY DIDN'T HELP THE SCRATCHES ARE TOO DEEP. SONY CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS! I WILL NEVER BY SONY PRODUCTS AGAIN!"
4,one month with the DVPCX995V,I would like to correct a bit of misinformation in my first review of this product. In order to scan the folder inventory you must first set the tv-dvd selector to disc exploror position. you must then push the enter folder button which will bring up the titles you have entered in the folder. By pushing the up or down arrows and holding them down you can scan at the rate of 100 titles every 40-45 seconds. I don't know if this is recommended but it ddoes speed up the selection process.
4,excellent,this is great I actually bought this as a gift for my sister so the reason I am send this is to thank you for shipping it so quickly it is wonderful thanks againtony
2,It's better than handling discs - that's all,I've had mine for about a year and other than capacity it has little going for it. Calling it a control/command structure is much too complimentary a description of its use of 'logic'. It is clunky and annoying to use from both the unit and the remote. PC keyboard input of disc information is frustrating and the machine dumps the entry if you remove a disc. The 'logic' feels like it was developed 15 years ago.Update almost 4 years later: This one continues to function fine mechanically and has never damaged a disc. It will occasionally lose the title of a disc. The control electronics are gruesomely primitive and an Excel spreadsheet of your collection is well worth the effort. If you google 'sony onion' you will find a piece that was probably written by someone who owned one of these - Warning - Language not safe for children but then neither is mine when I'm having to deal with this device.
4,Greeat DVD Player...One Downfall,"I agree with most of the other reviews on this 400 DVD disc player. I have had mine for three years now and it is a great piece of equipment but there is one downfall that I have found with my system. Two years ago, I bought a DVD recorder that records DVD+R/RW. Now according to the manual on my Sony 400 DVD player, the system should play my recorded DVD+R DVDs, however, I have had problems getting my Sony 400 DVD player to play these recorded DVD discs. The DVD will stick or show pixels in the picture while playing. I have done my homework to find out if it was the dvd disc or player. The DVD discs work fine on all my other players so I have narrowed it down to being my Sony 400 DVD player that isn't compatible with all my recorded dvd discs. That being said, this is a wonderful unit but if you are going to make your own dvd discs, do not expect them to always work in the Sony 400 DVD Player."
4,If you want a DVD Jukebox...this is it,Pretty much works as advertised. The only thing you should know before buying is that the UPCONVERSION (to 720p and 1080i) only works over the HDMI output. Output choices for Component are 480i and 480p. The primary value of this player is that it can hold and catalog up to 400 DVDs. You can plug in a standard PC keyboard to make data entry easier. Picture and sound quality is fine.
1,Sony DVP-CX 995V failure. No Disc!,"This item is very unreliable. Sony offered a HDMI disc to activate the feature and after activation the unit failed. Sony refuses the repair. This is already the second unit I used and failed. The common failure is indicated by: Won't play disc, any discv. The unit is virtually worthless and no one will repair it. The failure is software related and only Sony must fix it.Who buys it is a fool! Also overpriced!"
4,Quality Product,Great Product. Exactly as described. It's almost full already. Didn't realize I had so many movies.
4,Shuffle Play Question,"I bought this dvd changer to store my cds and dvds. I'm happy with my purchase, but I've encountered an aggravating glitch.The problem I've run into is trying to shuffle ""all"" of the cds without including the dvds. When I push shuffle play, it wants to shuffle all the discs in the changer...including the dvds. I can't seem to find the option to shuffle cds only. I've tried going into the folder mode, but when I do this, shuffle play is automatically cancelled, and I can't find an option in the folder mode to return to shuffle play. [...]"
1,Returned...dvd player skipped on many of my movies.,Returned the Sony DVPCX995V 400-Disc DVD Mega Changer/Player because it skipped scenes on many of my dvd's. I could put the dvd in another player and it would play fine.I liked the organization of my movies and would repurchase this player if Sony worked out the bugs!
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I use the Sony DVD player with a Pioneer Kuro 60 inch plasma TV. The picture quality produced by that combination is very good. It is close enough to the quality of my Blue Ray player, that I continue to buy DVD's as well as some Blue Ray disks. The Sony player takes longer than I expected to load and begin playing a disk, but the picture quality is worth the wait, and the sound quality is also very good. I would recommend this product to anyone who owns a rather large collection of DVD's.By the way, I have read other reviewers' suggestions to use Excel to catalog the DVD's loaded in the Sony player. I recommend using Access instead. With Access, I can sort my DVD's by title, genre, actors, year produced, rating, and my subjective quality score. It is fun to invite friends to select the movie of their choice by any of those categories, then simply use the remote control to play the movie selected."
4,Performs the Function,This unit has done exactly what I wanted. Stored my DVDs and provide very good output quality to my SONY LCD.The manual could be improved and the explorer function. With the price of flash and SD memory falling so fast I think SONY could look at some type of data storage solution so as to not lose the data during power outages.For those complaining about the speed. It does have a lot of discs to move and it is ejecting and inserting a dvd when you switch discs. If you can't wait that long then your a candidate for road rage. Just take a second and breathe.Unit is very large. Make sure you measure your area you plan to put it into before you buy it.I have had one disc that it would not read at all from Blockbuster.If explorer was better this would be a 5
3,Works just okay,"Product isn't very responsive. Compared to the same DVD changer that I have, which is older, this new one doesn't quite work right. I didn't retun it because we're moving abroad soon and can't take it anyway. Will probably just give it away to a friend."
1,Warning - Do not buy this piece of junk.,"What a piece of junk. Get a 5 disc DVD player instead. Come on Sony, why are you laying a piece of expensive, untested junk on us. Stay away. Too many problems to list. The Sony DVP CX995V is the most user unfriendly piece of equipment I have ever dealt with. And just wait until you have the entire unit full of your DVD's (400 of them) and then the thing breaks down and you have to remove all of those DVD's after fighting to get the stuck DVD door open!!! And then the repair shop has the unit for over three weeks and then you get it back and it works for two days and then breaks down again (of course after putting in the 400 DVD's again). Just imagine the nightmare. You have been warned. DO NOT BUY."
3,Beware - in my opinion,"I purchased the Sony DVP-CX995V July 2005 FOR $400. I've loved that it holds 400 CD/DVD's even though I'm not a techy person at all. I've had it less than 3 years. Currently it will still play CD's, but will not play a DVD at all. It says ""Cannot Play Disc"". I've tried DVD's that I've played before, my Netflix movies, zippo - won't play anything. I called Tech Support and told me to do the unplug thing - didn't work. Then unplug for 3 hours and try again - zippo. I looked on the Sony site and see they have an ""Exchange Program"". I pay to send it back, also pay $261.47 and they'll ship me a refurbished unit. Let's see....I spent $400, it worked for under 3 years, and now they want $261.47 for a refurbished one..I don't think so. Sorry Sony can't do better than that. My next changer will not be a Sony."
4,Best thing I own for DVD playback,"I suppose I'll start with the badnews first. Its a pain typing in your dvds so they can be filed in explorer menus.. But then again, I'd rather make my own titles. The ones that load from disc are all caps and its not the title I want to put. And it can't be changed. And some of the titles seem to disappear over time. I'm not sure why. Perhaps the memory that remembers the name has a glitch.The best thing about this is the picture quality.. darn near HD with 1080i.I used a 4 quick menu to classify my dvd's into drama, sci f- comics, love n war, and action. Easy to look up what dvd I want to play. Sure beats cable.I liked this so much I decided to get another.Sony put out a new blue ray 400 disc that is $1800. No way!!!! Too rich for my blood to be paying $30 a pop a movie.Make sure you set your remotes if you have more than one of these otherwise you will turn them both on at the same time."
4,What a life!,I would love to be able to travel and sample all the cusine that Linda does in this sweet little book. She is a great writer!
2,Tedious,"I expected better from Ellerbee, having enjoyed ""Move On"" and her television work. But while this memoir has moments that are delightful, too much is tedious, overwritten, a lot of detail that never gets anywhere, and seemingly endless ""He did this and I did that and how funny/silly/clever we were."" Overall it reads like a pastiche slapped together just to get a book out."
5,Truly a Gem,"I grew up watching Nick News and idolized Linda Ellerbee, this book is a fun peek into her personal world - her travels, relationships and food. Most of the essays weave all three together, ending with a relavant recipe. I wish I had half her guts, I mean she travelled to Central America while an 18-year-old student at Vanderbilt University, embraced the people and food (and drink) of Bolivia and writes in retrospect ""I didn't save any souls. I didn't change anybody's life but mine."" What more is there? She writes of the Rhinestone Cowgirls ""To women, girlfriends aren't a luxury. They're a healthy necessity, like good skin or good hair..."" Spot on. Her sixtieth birthday hike is inspirational, I hope I can be half as cool at that age.Insightful and funny, Ellerbee writes from the heart. And so it goes."
4,Good Character Study,"Perhaps not as 'swash-buckeling' as I thought it would be, but it made for some interesting reading. I think it provided a look at a period of history that is not very well portaited by today's writers; indeed the moral values brought out by Defoe are of a higher standard than most authors in the 20th century, (apart from authors with religious convictions with personal beliefs they are pushing)."
3,Inexpensive Fun Toy,"Son loved the Atomic Blaster. Purchased to go with his astronaut suit. Inexpensive, not great quality but he enjoyed it until he tore the blaster rockets apart!"
1,Wonderful...if you were the son of John Ames,"This book would be a great read if you were actually the son of John Ames and were reading about your own father's history since it would at least bear personal relevance. For the general public, however, this book is incredibly boring and lacks basic continuity.I'd have put the book down after the first 30 pages only it was a book club book and I felt obligated to put myself through the misery of actually reading it."
1,Shame on Pulitizer!,"And shame on the editors!A mediocre short story at best.There was enough repeating drivel in this book to earn syndication royalties.For all the endless blabbering the narrator does about his wife, we are told next to nothing about her. ""I have no family"", she says, and that's it....247 pages, that's inexcusable.Most importantly for me, the preacher himself was mind numbingly boring, bland and indecisive. To what good is this preacher as an example, if he is so overwrought with selfdoubt?At 77 years old, if this is the ""life/legacy letter"" this preacher feels so compelled to leave to his young son then someone should phone the child protection agency. Sheeze! That's just plain cruel to leave that mess to a child.I tried repeatedly to find at least one passage to ""hightlight"" as inspiring. Never found one."
2,Too much religious philosophizing,"I am on the side of those who feel this book was a big bore and not really a novel. All the religious stuff bored me to death.AND - I am a college graduate who has read many classics, plus much modern literature. Why are there sentences in this book that I cannot understand despite re-reading them?"
4,Grace,"This book is full of grace. An old minister, who knows he is dying, writes letters to his young son, telling him who he is, what he observes and believes. The epistlatory format and slow moving narrative might put off some readers who crave overt conflict and action in a novel. For me, reading this book was like spending a summer evening on my grandfather's porch, listening to his stories, and watching fireflies."
4,gentle genius,"Gilead: A NovelI do not think I have ever read a novel that had me weeping by the end. I have also never written a review about anything before, but this book gets me to my computer. I give this 4 stars only because this starts slowly, like a walk to Kansas. This is a very rich piece of human story, and I am so glad to realize that the Pulitzer team knows how to recognize such gentle genius."
2,Wonderful bedtime reading - puts me to sleep everytime.,"I keep this book by my bed as a sleep aid. Even if I am not feeling overly tired, I read a few pages and I can't keep my eyes open. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with insomnia!"
2,Gilead,"I am very surprised and puzzled over all the praise that has been given this book. I found it to be turgid, slow moving and rather dull. Even though I am close to the age of the Minister and grew up in the same era as he did, I could not relate to him nor Gilead,Iowa at all. In fact I found him quite a wimp!! As for his so-called ""wisdom"",that,too,struck a wrong note with me. His philosophy is very simplistic; anyone with a knowlege of religion and/or philosophy will be quite impatient with the musings of our Minister."
2,Needing balm for Gilead,"Because I loved Marilynne Robinson's ""Housekeeping"" I really looked forward to devouring ""Gilead"". So far, I'm disappointed. One reviewer called the book ""demanding"". I would call it tedious in the extreme."
1,Yawn stifling meanderings,"While the author has a talent for making simple words seem lyrical, this so-called ""letter"" could have been half as long and therefore half as BORING. Didn't identify with the setting, the over the hill preacher or any of the tiny little everyday details of his life - past or present. Is this really how he wants his son to see him? Why do people try to justify books like this just because they have ""Pulitizer Prize"" attached? I'm beginning to think the group that awards the prizes must also lead very BORING lives and therefore don't know any better. Whatever happened to dynamic, thought-provoking story-telling with good character development, settings that jump off the pages rich in description, and succinct language that tells it all in a minimum of words, but the right ones?"
2,Novel?...Very Long Essay!,"I was memsmerized by Robinson's HOUSEKEEPING but bored by GILEAD because I expected a novel...maybe the technique of a long letter to a son or grandson (or whomever an author chooses) has been overused or maybe the characters did not present as real or maybe it was the lack of plot...whatever the reason I was bored. I am pretty objective in regard to religous opinion (biblical), so agreeing to an author's point of view is not enough to make gripping fiction...I skimmed...Its interesting to see the books that are bestsellers and win awards. Maybe that aspect makes it worth the read."
3,A woman writes from a man's POV?,"Yes, this book moves at a glacial pace and the overwhelming religiousness of it wasn't always to my liking. But I made my way through it thanks to the quality of the writing and the interesting philosophies that transcend religion. But I don't consider it chauvinistic to say that I could not get over the fact that a female author was writing from the POV of an elderly man. No matter how good a writer she is, IMO a female can't truly know the inner feelings of a father toward his son, just as I would never presume I would know how a mother truly feels about her daughter (or son for that matter). There is something intrinsically different about how a woman sees and feels things compared to how a man sees and feels things, and I just couldn't get over my sense that everything Rev. Ames felt were actually the thoughts of a female author."
5,"A gentle, lovely novel","This was my first introduction to Robinson and I have to say that I was so impressed with her prose and story line. She teaches us much through the life and death (or process of dying)of John Ames. This book was recommended to me by a friend and I have purchased it as a gift for someone else. Very moving. This is not in-your-face, Polyanna Christianity. This is about living and dying and honoring God in the process."
4,Good Read,Very good book. Thought provoking and a fast read. Some of the thoughts are very deep and said in a simple way. Enjoyable journey through his life and the insights he tries to pass along. Makes you stop often and dwell on an idea or a past bit of wisdom being described. Worth your time reading.
1,Boring beyond belief,"I really don't get why people seem to love this book so much. I got the themes -- the meditations on the relationships between fathers and sons, for example -- but overall this book didn't strike me as tightly written. It felt more like Robinson jotted down miscellaneous thoughts, realized she couldn't figure out a way to use them in a conventionally structured novel, and decided to use the epistlatory form as an easy out. Robinson can write -- there are paragraphs here and there throughout the book that are beautifully crafted -- but the book as a whole is disappointing.In short, overall Gilead seemed very contrived and unnatural. The passing references to John Brown appeared poorly researched, and even Robinson's geography is messed up. She keeps describing Kansas as though it's right next to Iowa, and it definitely is not. Would not recommend it to anyone."
5,There is a balm in Gilead,"Marilynne Robinson is that rare author whose work will be read a century from now. Her first novel --Housekeeping-- was a perfect psychological study of the search for salvation in a wondrously dysfunctional universe. Her collection of essays --The Death of Adam-- was a serious work of almost Calvinist criticism, a courageous, compelling effort, defying the climate of our times. Now her second novel is available in paperback. Gilead is a spiritual novel of grace, hope, and faith. It is not sentimental or facile, it is not melodramatic or traumatic. It both is and is not a sermon on the power of goodness to uplift the downtrodden, the forlorn, and those who have lost their way in life. Robinson's prose is plain and precise. This is a small book that needs to be read slowly, thoughtfully, in the solace of silence."
2,Over sentimental,"Excellent prose, almost poetical writing. Theres no doubt the writer has a gift for such. I'm not so sure of the content though. Mrs Robinson's main protagonist was less than convincing as a MALE pastor.I read three quarters of the book and had to put it down unfortunately out of severe boredom. Perhaps I shouldn't be reviewing it because it appears much of the ""good stuff"" was nearer the end. I didn't have the strength to make it that far, wading throught the mawkish over sentimentality withered me down.I've been hearing that ""life is beautiful"" phrase all too often lately and its becoming cliche. If you you want to read a book of substance with some interesting observations and messages about life (which is what I thought the Pulitzer prize was about) then this is not the book for you.If you want a book about the wonderousness of life, melodramatically embroidered love and all things nice and squidgy then by all means buy it."
4,"A Beautiful Novel, Well Worth Your Time","I bought this book simply because it won the Pulitzer and I wanted to read something a little deeper than my usual beach read fare.It took me some time to get into it, after about 50 pages I realized that I had to slow down and read it more carefully. I went back to the beginning and started to read it like a letter and then I got it. Ms. Robinson has a way with words, if you allow them to they can transport you to the time and place she's writing about.I spent a lot of time reading and re-reading this short book and by the time I was done I felt I was a part of the family. I've since lent this book to several people and received varying reviews from them but everyone loves the use of language."
1,The problem with literature,"This book illustrates the issue I have with contemporary American literature, flat, uninviting and has very little bearing on modern life or concerns. A disjointed story that for me contained no focus or reason to really care about the subject matter. Very tepid."
1,"Dull, dull, dull","...and stupid. Full of wonder for the creation and blah blah blah. No character is likeable in this book or even remotely interesting. I can imagine having to be in their company and going out of my mind with boredom, talking about beautiful phrases as the twinkling of an eye and the infinite goodness of the Lord and incorruptibility. I wonder how many people it has driven off religion once and for all. And I know marriage is supposed to be a mystery and has to be consumated, but frankly I find quite disgusting the idea of a seventy year old man consumating with a thirty year old woman. Also if I had a son I wouldn't be comforted with the thought that he died of the Spanish influenza and so didn't have to kill anyone. He is so satisfied with himself with this explanation, that I'd like to hit him and wake him up. I wouldn't give this book to my worse enemy. The Pulitzer Committee obviously had been out on a binge the night before giving it the prize."
2,A Disappointment,"The ""build up"" on the fly and back cover of this book would lead you to believe that it is more than it is. I found it hard to follow for the first 100 pages, lost interest, kept reading for a book group and finally finished it, otherwise I would not have."
2,I Missed It,"Perhaps it was over my head, I don't know. All I can say is I had a awfully hard time finishing this, which doesn't happen to me very often. I had looked at the book a few times, but it wasn't until it won the Pulitzer that I thought of reading it. Yes, there is plenty of beautiful simple writing,however, the plot seemed to languish between passages of keen observation on faith and life, and love, and death. It just didn't hold my interest. I'd give it the benefit of the doubt and say it could be I was expecting something very different, and just wasn't prepared for the pace and tone of the book."
5,A masterful literate letter of an old man's existential crisis,"John Ames, a 76 year old preacher from Iowa, is dying. This book is his letter to his 7 year old son. An amazing exploration of father/son relationships and one preacher's existential crisis.This is *not* a ""spiritual"" book reserved for religious minded people; any parent, any adult, anyone interested in the human condition will find this a wonderful book.I read in one review that the book teaches you how to read it; and that is a terrific insight. The pace is more measured, but it is not slow, and there is treasure on every page."
4,Good but slow,"I enjoyed this novel, but the pace is slow and the story line does not compell you to read keeping reading, so I ut it down for days at a time."
2,Gilead boring,"you're got 50 pages to get my attention. this one didn't do it. pretty boring. maybe the prose was supposed to be wonderful to make me wanna keep reading, but the plot/storyline was forgettable"
3,On the fence about this one...,"Yes---beautifully written, clever, thought-provoking but...lacking (dare I say it with all the glowing reviews?) I am glad I read it yet would not recommend it. On the fence...."
4,beautifully written novel of reflection,Gilead is a beautifully written novel of the thoughts and memories of a pastor in his later years. The main character recounts the events of his life and portions of his family history for his son when he is gone. This book is not as much action or event driven as it is almost a poem as a novel. The story is touching at times but at the same time gets somewhat repetitive regarding the relationship between the main character and his namesake. Worth reading.
2,Couldn't Wait to Finish...,"I found this book dissapointing. I see from many other reviews, and from the Pulitzer Board, that I am in the minority. We all have our own tastes. There are plenty of Pulitzer Prize winning novels that I read and wonder ""What am I missing here?"" This is just one more in that category. The story is slow. The characters are only slightly interesting, but not enough to grab my attention for long. I forced myself to pick up the book at night, counting how many pages until the ending. I skimmed pages at a time when the writing became tedious. I gave the book away. Try ""Angle of Repose"" by Stegner for an incredible Pulitzer Prize read."
1,I'm Sure it's Just Me,"Yes, I know it won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, but I found it impossibly dense and boring. I never made it past page 50."
1,Boring Book!,"I can't believe all the praise this book received! It is so boring! There is absolutely no plot, it's just a bunch of letters that the author wrote about his life. It is very hard to follow and is uninventive. I originally bought it because it's a Pulitzer Prize winner, but I was very, very disappointed."
1,Couldn't Get Through It,It put me to sleep. I just couldn't finish it. There's no story and it just goes on...and on... and on... Oops! Falling asleep again.
2,What a disappointment!,"I've liked or loved all of the Pulitzer winners I've read. I bought this book because it won the prize and expected to at the very least -- like it. Sadly, I didn't like it and had to force myself to finish it. I hung on only because I knew it had to get better. And, it finally it in the last 20%. But, not enough to redeem the first 80%."
4,A Personal Journey,"The Pulitzer Prize winning ""Gilead"" is an extremely personal book--an aging Congregationalist minister tells his story through his diary entries--meant to be read by his 7-year old son in about 15 years (long after his ill father's death). The historical background harks back to the days of John Brown, the radical abolitionist preacher. The ""current"" day is rural Iowa (Gilead of the title) in the `50s. I struggled with some of the theological discussion (although Congregationalists are cousins to Unitarians), but Rev. Ames story of personal discovery kept me going. There is a great story about a town in Kansas that you'll long remember."
4,What a Drag it is Getting Old,"I don't have any really brilliant insights about this book. Others have pointed out that it isn't a novel, but it is. It's dull and plodding, but it captivates. It resolves everything, but it doesn't. It's about fathers and sons, but also about mothers and daughters - and mothers and sons - and fathers and daughters. It's about love and forgiveness unlooked for and discovered with surprise and about love and forgiveness expected but not delivered.I finished the book a little disappointed, but I believe I must read it again more carefully.I still don't have an idea why the whole cow in the tunnel story was included."
5,Gift,The person who received this book enjoyed reading it. Very well written. It was recommended by a friend who also enjoyed it.
1,No plot,"This is not the type of book I enjoy reading. I had read other reviews that sang the praises of Gilead, so I ordered the book and was looking forward to reading it. When I started reading, I kept thinking of the reviews that noted that as the story progressed, the book got better . I kept waiting for the book to get ""interesting"" and, in my view, it just never improved. I got bogged down in the slow, steady rendition of the life story of the author. There is no plot to drive the book forward. It is a book that can easily be put down and not be picked up again for days. If you just need a time filler, this is the book to choose."
5,A slow book that made my heart race,"I'll take character over plot, any day; and in Gilead, that's what we get. The caliber of Robinson's writing holds the pages together. Long associated as a professor at the Iowa Writer's Workshop, Robinson proves that it's not always true, the old adage: ""Those who can't do, teach."" She obviously can do both. A Pulitzer Prize-winner worthy of the honor."
2,"I'm tired of reading ""also ran"" Pulitzer books","Aside from a few charming anecdotes and a little well crafted use of archaic phrasing, this book was a total snooze to me. I love beautiful writing but this book has very little story, and the first person narrative of the boring, but well intentioned minister gets old VERY quickly.Thank goodness Jack comes along in the second half of the book to add some interest...but my attention was lost by then.Robinson also has a habit of repeating previously presented information over and over...if I had to read one more time about how the church ladies would come into the reverend's house to clean or to leave dinner...If you're looking for advice on future book purchases from competition winners, look to the National Book Award winners and Whitbread Winners. I should have learned my lesson with ""A Frolic of His Own""!!!"
3,Too slow for my taste,I found this to be a well written contemplative book that was too slow for my taste. I enjoyed reading it in small doses but found it didn't drag me back for more.
1,"Tedious, pretentious and self indulgent","""Mesmerising"" is a word i've seen several times by critics describing this novel but i'm not sure that they don't really mean ""soporific"".I don't buy the premise of this novel for a start. The idea of an aging man writing this dull treatise to his young son just doesn't seem plausible to me. Its clearly just a device for the author to hold forth with her musings on life the universe and everything in it and that's a bit like listening to someone describing their dreams. You might be attentive for the first 30 seconds but after that its all you can do to stifle the yawns. The maudlin ramblings of the Rev Ames failed to interest me in the slightest. There's no doubt that Marilynne Robinson can write beautiful prose but its a shame she doen't have anything interesting to write about."
1,"Very lonely, slow, like watching paint dry...well written .... BUT...","Many 5 star reviews actually hit it right on the head: well written, slow moving, needs to be appreciated, not for everyone, give it a chance. Give it a chance???? I spent $15 on the paperback at Borders and what a waste. The damn thing won a Pulitzer so I thought I couldn't go wrong but it's exactly what the five star people said it was EXCEPT for one thing.... The reader needs to be in the mood to read a novel that is like watching paint dry... over a period of three weeks! Real wet paint, in the highest of humidity!!!"
5,Disregard my comments ...,"You should disregard my comments because I have not yet read Gilead. What I did do is hear Ms. Robinson read from it on the Diane Rehm show yesterday ... It was movingly and tenderly rendered by someone who thinks deeply about the human experience. I ran right out to my Barnes and Noble (sic!) and bought their last copy to give my wife.It takes a beautiful soul to write from the heart with such simplicity, such openness, such awareness of the nuances of our lives, be they simple or hopelessly complex. I thank her for trusting us, her readers, with her private thoughts.Interesting that the reviews here are so polarized. Is this a reflection of our more general polarization? But it's late, and I ramble.Kudos to Marylynne. Her humanity and love for her fellow man shine brilliantly in her prose."
5,Gilead,I recieved the book promptly and in new condition. Marilynne Robinson is a treat to read on close reading of the text. I would recommend this book to any student of literature.
5,Lovely,"Perhaps Kurt Vonnegut is not the authority on all literature.... With the definition quoted below, we would lose a huge number of THE truly great writers, including (but not limited to) William Faulkner, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, etc.Now, _Gilead_ is hardly another _Finnegan's Wake_ (some of us can't make up our own languages), but it is a beautiful piece of writing that rewards the persistent reader. Robinson focuses on the emotional and psychological processes of her characters, allowing readers and characters alike to contemplate existence, spirituality, and love. Complex characters, exquisite syntax, beautiful writing, and powerful themes that are well worth the effort."
5,Don't pass this up,This is not a typical read - I almost put it down when I couldn't get into it very quickly. But I am so incredibly glad that I stuck with it. There are some real gems in here that I will always treasure. The perspective that the author brings is uncommon these days. It is definitely an untraditional story line but stick with it and you won't be disappointed. Highly recommended.
4,A remarkable book,"For a novel which is essentially without a plot to hold one's attention and build a growing admiration for the author's skill is no mean achievement. That is what this book did for me.Seldom have I found the description of simple virtue, thoughtfulness, and Christian integrity so convincing. As the grandfather of an eight-year-old, I can see the potential value of committing to writing an account of the experiences, lessons and insights I have gained in my life -- as well as mistakes I have made -- but which would possibly be lost if I were to wait until my grandson is old enough to understand.There may be those whose impatience and perhaps immaturity preclude an appreciation of this fine book. I hope they might find the opportunity to read it again in 20 years time."
1,why the condescension?,"Jack asks, ""'Do you ever wonder why American Christianity seems to wait for the real thinking to be done elsewhere?'""do you ever wonder what kind of depauperate religious and philosophical background this author meanders from? this kind of presumptive and disparaging attitude toward americans is tiresome. guess what--yes, there are american christians who do think, deeply.why would I want to read a book underscored with an elitist, dismissive point-of-view?- a thinking american atheist"
2,Gilead,"Sorry, this may have won a pulizer prize, but I found it boring. The only reason I finished it beacause it was my book club book. When the characters were expanded it was interesting, but that was not often, most of the characters were flat and uninteresting. I found myself thinking was this the kind of history I would leave to my child - I think not."
2,Boring Mini--Essays,"This is a novel only in the barest sense. There is little plot, and what plot there is, is so mundane and pedestrian as to smack of a first year literature student stuggling to piece together various story lines from past read works. Gilead is really the musings and sometimes arcane philosophy of Ms. Robinson, written in various letters by an underachieving preacher. The book is a tedious read, and after the first few pages, one reluctantly treads on, hoping for some epiphany, or at least a surprise along the way. It never comes, and after a while the reader only wants to finish the boring treatise."
3,Bookclub selection-,There were mixed reviews on this book but caused a lot of discussion. I would not have finished this book if I was reading it on my own but glad I did after the discussion
4,A Unique Approach,"This thoughtful book is meant for a quiet read. A father's love, often NOT the subject of books, is infused in these pages."
3,A Narrator's Review,"I probably never would have started this novel, let alone finishing it, were it not for the fact that I was assigned it to record for the Talking Books program. Recording it in the voice of 76 yr old man wasn't too difficult, nor was finishing it, once started, because it came alive as I has to relect on how ideas and inflections were to be rendered. This made the writing ""live"" for me. Reading it aloud would help those who found it boring. It was slow in coming alive, but halfway through I was very intrigued as to how it would end (I don't read novels before recording them). I urge patience to those who find it tedious. It sticks with you after finishing."
1,Tedious. Boring. only little tidbits of worth,I expected so much more from Robinson. Waited a couple years to read it and do not intend to finish it. Would like to send it back to you. Life is too short to waste time with this rambling.
3,Gilead,"Tie book dragged for me. It had good material, but was too ""preachy"" for my taste. Good morals, and a good story, but it took a lot of determination for me to finish it."
3,beautiful prose but...,I have to say I was a bit disappointed in this book. I really haven't felt that way for a while about a book. If it wasn't for my book club I probably wouldn't have finished the book. It was a beautifully written book except it moved really slow. It got more interesting toward the end. I'm glad I read it and finished it but I thought it was a bit boring.
2,"A decent story, but not much else.","I was interested in the idea of the book, had a good premise. I lost most of my interest probably half way through. Just didn't do it for me."
2,The Sideways of Books,"This book is just like the movie ""Sideways"", everyone but me loved it and I can't figure out why. Slow, fairly plot-less and uninspiring, but award-winning and critically acclaimed.I'm sure for some people it is a great book, but not for me."
3,Gilead,"This was my book club selection, and I found it interesting because it was written as a series of letters from a minister to his son. It took place in the late 1800's and just getting used to how ministers think was unusual for me. But I learned a lot. I'm now reading it for the second time because I've been told that I'll appreciate it more with the second reading"
2,Slow and too Christian for me,"If one were a Christian and liked to get into the head of what a preacher deals with, it could be interesting. My interest in Christian justification is nil and I didn't even finish the book."
2,Not my type of book,Gilead: a Novel: This was just not my type of book. I'm reading it because it was picked by the book club I belong to. Could not get into it. No easy to follow. Too much of the same thing.
4,Interesting - different than my usual choices.,"I read this book because it was the book chosen by my book club. I'm not sure if I would have read it otherwise. Since the main character is a preacher, he talks a lot about his faith, etc. By the time I was well into the book I finally started really wondering about the characters and how it would end. A nice read -just different than what I would normally pick."
2,Book too slow and religious,Could not wait for the book to end. Some interesting moments in book to conemplate but all in all too slow.
4,Contemplative and Thoughtful,"Reading Gilead is a bit like being swept down a slow moving stream. Robinson so effectively becomes the 76 year-old narrator, that as I read, I often forgot it was written by a woman. The narrator is convincing, believable, and flawed. He has wisdom, but at the same time he makes mistakes in judgement and possesses very human characteristics like jealousy. This book might be tagged as Christian or moral, but I think that those labels sell it short. Any variety of reader, Christian or atheist, can gain depth and understanding of life from the insights in this book. Robinson states things so eloquently that I found myself reading and re-reading passages so that I might remember them better. This book is not a page-turner, not filled with excitement on every page. However, while reading it, I felt like I was privy to see inside a life that held special meaning and insight...and I am better for having read the book."
4,Contemplative novel,"Summary, no spoilers:John Ames, a 76 year old minister from Iowa, is in failing health. He decides to write down his family history, and his thoughts about life, for the benefit of his young 6 year old son.John's remembrances go back and forth in time, and often read like diary entries. We learn about John's father and grandfather, also both ministers...although each with very different personalities.This is a very quiet book. It's beautifully written, and and filled with profound revelations and thoughts about the meaning of our lives.I think one really needs to be in a certain mood to read Gilead, almost a meditative state. There is very little ""action"" in this book, and yet it is expansive in it's reach.Recommended, but best be in the right mood to read it."
2,Gilead,"** As an old preacher nears the end of his life, he comes to the realization that he will not be there to see his seven year old grow to manhood. Therefore, before he passes from this world, he writes a letter, taking his son back in time with his words, explaining how the preacher became the man he now is in hopes of influencing the boy, despite being departed. Sprinkled through the meandering recollections are Biblical truths, metamorphasizing memories into parables. Much like Patterson's Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, in form, if not content, this has true wisdom conveyed in a style that will require the reader to cultivate patience. If you are hoping for a compelling plot or dynamic characters, you may wish to look elsewhere. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, freelance reviewer."
2,Just not worth the hype,"Using the format of a long letter (or series of letters?) to a seven-year-old boy from his elderly and dying father, Robinson has written a novel that draws in the battles over slavery in antebellum Kansas, along with more mundane daily life in small town Iowa during the first half of the 20th century. I know that Gilead has received accolades and even the Pulitzer, but I found it less than inspiring. I was able to finish it only because the story and quality of writing were so lightweight it could be finished quickly and I could go on to even better writing."
3,plodding and slow,"As winner of the Pulitzer Prize I was drawn to this novel. I'd heard several people recommend it and I'm always looking for prize-winning novels that are also readable and moving.However, as I worked my way through the book I kept asking myself what it was that the prize committee found so stirring and inviting. Yes, the voice is strong, yes, the tone is consistently moody and the characters are finely drawn, but... well, without trying to be too critical here, the pace is glacial and the use of metaphor is clunky and methodical. Ok, I get it. Water is your metaphor. Baptism, rain, dripping water, washing, cleansing. Enough already. Subtlety is obviously not one of the criteria for winning a Pulitzer.I managed to finish the book but wouldn't recommend it to you unless you're an extremely patient reader and enjoy heady, literary prose."
5,"Stick with this one...builds slowly, richly, in layers","Don't be put off by the plain prose or the seemingly slow pace at the start of this book. You might wonder, as I first did: Where's the story? Then I saw, as I kept going, that I was experiencing the richness of one man's life, built layer by layer, revelation by revelation.It waws a bit like meeting someone, not getting a strong first impression and then realizing that the person is deeper than you ever expected, surprising you with new perceptions and insignts, revealing a richness of spirit you hadn't foreseen."
2,Not a fan,"There's loads of reviews on this book so I won't duplicate explanations. However, I must say I fell into the category of those readers that just didn't care for this book. Yes, it has a quiet, gentle, reflective theme, but I admit to being just plain bored stiff.Sometimes after I've started a book that I just can't get into, I come to Amazon and read the reviews of others to see if I'm just totally off base. Then, I restart the book with a different attitude and try to envision what it was that others saw. For me, I never could capture the feelings of those readers who gave ""Gilead"" a 5 star rating. There were pages and pages that I read and reread time and again just trying to get something out of it. I didn't really become interested in this book at all until about page 220 when Jack Boughton reveals his reasons for returning home.This is not to diminish other reviews as we all certainly get something different out of the books we read. For me, however, it was just a waste of time."
3,no magic for this reader,"""Gilead"" has its good aspects, such as lovely writing and commentary on one man's life and that of various family members. I never got into the story. and finally skipped a chunk after the half-way point, picking up for the final 30-40 pages. I don't regret the move, because the remainder wasn't particularly engaging, either. Clearly, I must be missing something that yielded the Pulitzer and the high ratings here on Amazon. Perhaps I didn't catch the depth or appreciate the extended ruminations of life and religion, which I found neither particularly insightful nor inspirational, nor interesting enough to make up for the slow pace. I don't consider myself resistant to sentimentality, either, and ""Gilead"" has plenty, which somehow never lifted my sails."
5,"There is a town, in Iowa,","Gilead is a narrative of an Iowa preacher who understands he is succumbing to Congestive Heart Failure. Within view of his own mortality, which is unspecified but not far off, he has a vague target date to make himself right with the world. The CHF leaves him with limited activity and the terminal nature of the disease provides him a God-given gift: a deadline, to leave his thought legacy to his young son.The book is a pound cake of literature, dense with wisdom, both Biblical and Humanitarian. At times it was almost too heavy to read and digest. But it is a beautiful book, beautifully written, and worth the labor spent reading through the heavy parts. It will leave a weighty and sad, but very sweet aftertaste. There is a balm in Gilead and also, in Gilead."
3,Book Club selection - Calm and Detached,"I really wasn't sure about this book even after I read it. It is very well written, and interesting. There are no chapters at all, just one long narrative in first person. The story was set in the early 50's and the main character recounted episodes from his life of 70 or so years. Sometimes it was difficult for me to remember the year the events may have taken place. And the main conflicts of the book were boring to me, Yawn. I did like this book but I couldn't love it. It was a nice easy read, calm and collected."
3,Reviewing Gilead,"I read this book for our couples book club- incidently a group formed from our Sunday school class. I can't say that this is a book I would put at the top of my favorites list, but it is certainly one which will last with me; Gilead demands that you read it slowly, with appreciation for the deliberate pace of the elderly narrator. I also think it will improve with rereading over the passages I was too impatient to give good attention to the first time. Initially, I was put off by my difficulty making sense of the father-son-grandfather generations,so I think a rereading with that part straight in my mind will be helpful. It is rare to read a book with such a thoroughly good ""hero"" though our hero was human enough to be believable and lovable."
2,The long version of the bible.,"I continued reading thinking to myself there must be more to this book or perhaps the ending makes it all worth while. However, this was not the case at all after I labored through the entire book. It was incredibly boring unless you really like reading the bible and someone's interpretation of the meaning. There were parts that were nice, but it just went on and on and on. I think I could have made better use of my time by reading a textbook instead of choosing this novel for what I thought was my reading pleasure.-Kate-"
1,horrible!,"So bad it's offensive. Why is this ""fiction""? It's pages and pages of the main character (and I guess by extrension, the author) spouting his opinion on God and religion and fatherhood in a very boring way.I recommend ""The Road"", by Cormac McCarthy. Now there's an enjoyable read, and arguably about the same set of topics!"
2,Don't buy it just because you loved HOUSEKEEPING,"Marilynne Robinson is an astonishing writer, but this book doesn't really have a story, which is perfectly acceptable. But, unless you are particularly interested in musing on the nature of spiritual faith, it's not likely you'll find this book compelling in the way her novel HOUSEKEEPING was. I'm not religious, and I'm not particularly interested in religion as a subject of a novel as opposed to religion used to define a character in a novel. There is very little narrative interest in Gilead, and I didn't finish it."
1,"I didn't recieve the correct parts to put it together, so I cannot rate the functional item","I recieved 2 left sides and no right side for the stand. I emailed the merchant; they replied that they would send the correct parts right away. It is many weeks later, and the stand is still strung out on my living room floor, and the TV still sits on the floor and not the TV stand."
3,A string of quotations with little context,"I brought this book down to Bs As with me for a 2 wk visit. I planned to read it completely but, due to the writing style and contents, I ended up only reading hear-and-there as I visited neighborhoods.While helpful at times when walking through the city, the constant quoting of literature with which I was not familiar left the writing feeling fragmented and difficult to move through. It seemed as though the author avoided doing any processing of the sources by just assembling a long string of direct quotes with little context on the literary work, its author or historical background provided. If you were a literature major you might have gotten more out of this but I'm fairly well read and I recognized few to none of the references in any given passage. After reading about the neighborhood I was walking through I felt only marginally more educated on the cultural context of what I was seeing. You can probably find something more useful elsewhere."
2,Not interesting for pre-teens and younger,"This book seems informative for people who like to read a bunch of blabbering before getting to the point of the book that is learning Kiswahili. It is probably not good for a person who just wants to learn the words, sentences, and meanings. It is better for someone who wants to learn the background and history of the authors thoughts and experience in the Kiswahili speaking areas of the world along with words, sentences, and meanings."
3,Beware the Inaccuracies,"This is a companion textbook to Puerto Rico: The People and Culture. It shares the same style and grade level vocabulary as the aforementioned book. It talks about the island's important landscapes, and it is also accessible to fourth to sixth graders. In addition, it provides a comprehensive survey of the most important historical sites and natural landscapes the island has to offer. However, like People and Culture, this book also shares similar inaccuracies and omissions: Puerto Rico never gained its independence from Spain and the omission of the Spanish-American War among these. Readers must double check with other reliable resources, if they plan to use it in class. I recommend with reluctance."
4,good gamw,"I like how the field seems smaller this year, more realistic. not really any cheap goals like in years past, ie driven cross and shot. One on ones are easier this year, as they should be"
5,Im impressed,"This game is amazing, ill just start there. The graphics are top notch, and the gameplay has become alot better. It is WAY more realistic. This is finally a game where you can take on the defense one on one and get by him alot of the time, especially with this years addition of the left trigger skill moves. Also, the Be-A-Pro mode is without a doubt my most favorite mode of the game. It actually makes you feel like a player and gives you a cool connection that you get with very few games. The teams are plentiful, there are enough players to populate a small town and its all on that cd. All in all, a very good game that ill be playing for a while without ever, if ever, getting tired of it. Now all they need is the San Jose Earthquakes of the MLS =P"
4,A Garwood Favorite,"I have read all of Ms. Garwood's books. PRINCE CHARMING is a great story and for those who like a little western in their romances, this one is perfect. I loved the hero Lucas and Taylor was delightful as the heroine who follows him to Montana. Garwood has a unique writing style that doesn't disappoint in this one. She easily shows her flare for being able to diversify location settings within the same book, added to that is the building tension between Lucas and Taylor and you have an enjoyable read."
3,Nose Dive,"While this book started off fast paced, and exciting it took a big nose dive about three fourths of the way to the end. Lucas and Taylor are very memoriable characters but the ending was so anticlimatic. On the back cover it says that lucas marries Taylor to help get his brother home but that was never really fleshed out in the book. But who cares right? we want to know about them falling in love. Sure we do. But we also want the story to flow and adhere to the way the characters are presented to us. The book gave me no real reason for a self proclaimed eternal bachleor to give up his single life to help some dame that was jilted at the alter. I got to the end of the book and was like, ""are you kidding me? this cant be the end."""
4,"A good book, but I've read better from Garwood.","This book wasn't as great as I thought it would be, but it was still good. I liked the idea of fate pulling two people together, but this one wasn't all that good. But like I said, I liked it."
4,Sweet and Funny,"I love Garwood's historicals, and this was one of my favorites. I must have missed it the first time around (mid-90's), and it was like Christmas when I stumbled across it.The setting is a little different: America, not Scotland. (But again, the English are the bad guys, lol). The characters are as expected: the exceptionally feminine, beautiful and good heroine that softens the exceptionally masculine, handsome and surly hero. The secondary characters are a big part of this one, and the introduction of three children in the last half offers even more pathos and humor.For those new to Garwood, she has some quirks. She can write an entire scene that is just a set up for a one-liner at the end of a chapter. In other words, she sometimes forgoes logic to deliver a ""moment."" But since you enjoy said moment, it is easy to shrug off.This is a long book for a romance, more than 500 pages, but there's something to enjoy on every one."
4,Beautiful Story.,This is one of the few books I re-read every year. A beautiful story that brings laughter and joy to your heart as you read it.
3,This is a good book - but compared to Julie Garwood's other books...it's a 3 out of 5 :),"This is a good book - but compared to Julie Garwood's other books...it's a 3 out of 5 :)I was disappointed mainly in the ending. It ended very abruptly, no epilogue, etc. You don't know what happens to Victoria and Hunter, do Lucas and Taylor have babies, do they ever go to Lucas' and his brother ranch, etc...."
2,SWEET BUT NO ROMANCE,"THIS IS A NICELY WRITTEN BOOK A SWEET STORY THAT FLOWS NICELY BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A ROMANCE LOOK ELSEWHERE THERE IS TOO MUCH ADULTS LOOKING AFTER CHILDREN DESCRIPTIONS NOT A FUN ESCAPE MORE OF A SWEET STORY ROMANCE LIMITED MORE ABOUT PREACHING ON BEING A DECENT HUMAN BEING GOT TIRING AFTER THE TITLE PROMISED ROMANCE, THERE WAS NEAR TO NONE!!! MORE ABOUT BABIES AND JUVENILE INCIDENTS AND MEN TRYING TO ACT MANLY A FRIEND THAT THEY MEET DURING THEIR TRIP CRIES HER WAY THROUGH THE BOOK AND QUOTES SHAKESPEARE AT THAT WHICH IS A KILLER .I FELT TRAPPED IN A NURSERY WITH NAGGING FEMALES AND PATIENT MEN ,NO ROMANCE AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not bad,"Not one of the best, but then I find most of Garwood's books cheesy and sappy, but pretty entertaining. This one was pretty hot, the hero was damned sexy, and the scenes with the children were pretty sweet.Note-some people mentioned that Taylor shouldn't have had the twins calling her ""Mama"", but ""Aunt."" I disagree. Considering they were only two, that MIGHT have geen a bit confusing. Later on, she could simply tell them that their first mother had been her sister.And I don't think adopting Daniel/David/Michael was such a bad thing, either. Poor kid was desparate for a family."
2,Not up to her other books,"I would not tell anyone to read this book unless,you have toread every thing by an author,and even then your'e going tohate this one.I normaly read her books more then once,thatshow good they are.But,this one I had trouble getting throughthe first time."
2,"Good story, slow reading","This story was good, but very slow reading. It took forever for the story to get going. Don't get for an easy, weekend read."
3,Not the greatest narration,"The narrator is English which makes it hard to understand, and she doesn't use different tones to distinguish between the characters which sometimes makes dialogue hard to follow. In addition, it seems an important story line was not included but is referenced to in the last track, which is somewhat confusing. Before you buy this, borrow it from your local library!"
4,Enjoyed this book,This is a good read if you are a fan of Julie Garwood. I have most of her books and now my daughters are enjoying them also
5,The best knife I have every purchased!,"I own many of the best rated kitchen knifes, whether they be made in France, Germany or Japan. This however, is the best most fun knife I've yet to purchase. It is very sharp, the angle is fabulous and it feels perfectly designed for standing and doing a lot of knife work. The weight is just the best for me. I find myself using this knife instead of most of the others, even when a smaller or larger one is called for. In time, I hope to replace all of the others with other Global knifes. The price offered at Amazon beat every other source I checked out."
4,Disappointed but I Love It Anyway,"I've had this knife for about a year and I am satisfied with it. The balance of the knife in my small hand is ideal, it is easy to grip, and the one-piece construction makes it easy to clean thoroughly. I even put it in the dishwasher without ill effect. The edge right out of the box was phenomenally sharp--I'll leave the gory descriptions to other reviewers--but it is a bit disappointing that I have not been able to re-hone the edge to that level of sharpness even with the recommended sharpener, which I also purchased. Food sticks to this hollow-ground knife just as much as it stuck to my old Henkels chef's knife. Overall, I would say that this is a good knife that is easy to use and clean with above average performance."
4,Sharp!,"this hollowground is great. Global really sends out knives that dont need to be re-sharpenend out of the box. It slices easily through meat and vegetables, even fish bones (when i cut the seabass in half the other day) Hence the name Santoku, It does all of it's 3 jobs very well. I'm waiting to see how sharp it will remain after a few more weeks. I'm not sure how the hollow grounds work, because cutting big pieces of onions and chicken still stick to the blade, but not other things. smaller pieces may not stick but it's a hollow ground santoku dammit! it's supposed to cut everything without sticking!"
3,dr.d's review,i think the videos in here are realy great. they're very amusing and i recomend it for almost any age.
3,galen,"It was a good book, would have loved for the book to continue further, I was looking for more and left me hanging. I guess I'll have to get the rest of the series"
4,Very enjoyable,Good summer beach read. Some good erotic scenes and some good fight scenes. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.
2,Does not stand out in the genre,"Gilbreath's novel by no means stands-out among the ever popular vampire genre. There is nothing original in this story. The characters are trite, especially the well-groomed and gregarious title character. The writing is mediocre at best, and the proofreading of the finished copy leaves much to be desired. Though the story is okay, and perhaps worth a reading if only for the sake of something to do on a lonely night, it is not worth the cover price. Though the cover says ""Galen: The Saga Begins"", the saga should probably also end here."
1,Low budget movies don't have to be this bad.,"This is one of those movies where the DVD cover art deserves a better movie. Fantasy is a difficult genre, because it takes some budget to pay for the costumes and special effects. BUt with a good script a good director can make a good fantasy movie on a low budget. Unfortunately, ""Dragon Hunter"" doesn't have a good script and obviously wasn't made by a good director (the same person who wrote the script). The plot is totally uninteresting and moves at a snail's pace. The cast don't help either; I don't expect Oscar-worthy performances in low budget movies but this movie has some of the most wooden dialogue and acting I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot of bad movies). It's slightly amusing to watch for about two minutes but the movie goes on for 90 very slow, very boring minutes. ""Dragon Hunter"" isn't worth spending money or even time on. I'm sure they had a good time making it but I didn't have a good time watching it."
1,You're kidding me right!?,Really guys how can you say anything good about this film!? I'm pretty sure it was filmed in my neighbor's backyard on and iphone. Wow....
1,2 hours I want back,This is by far the worse movie I have ever seen. I want the 2 hours I wasted watching this movie repaid to me.
1,It's pretty bad,"Dan Lehman's review says just about everything that needs to be said, but I'll add a few more gems. The book suggests to ""use rope instead of cord for extra strength"" (p. 114) and the ocean plait on p. 233 is presented in white cord, making it extremely difficult to follow. I'm pretty sure the final result is wrong, too. The round mat on p. 228 is recommended for use as a coaster for hot pans, but is presented in synthetic line. Unless you like having a goopy mass on the bottom of the pan, I wouldn't try it."
5,This Book Was WONDERful,Wonder is about a seventh grader who goes from popular to loser over the summer. She tries to make it through the school year with no friends and her ex-best friend against her. She then shows SCANTA that she isn't bothered by their teasing and gets to be friends with them. Wonder was WONDERful and a very fun book to read.
3,Nice book but be forewarned,"I liked the story line of this book, but be forewarned: (1)There are a lot of swear words. Period. (2)I don't like Jessica's attitude--OK, it is typical adolescent girl, but it is disrespectful, flares out at people for no reason without trying to think the situation through (how can you treat Conor nice one day and like trash the next? not my nature and never was!!) (3) I'm not going to approve a book that encourages kissing and kissing games at the seventh grade level. OK, sure, it's ""normal"" for many adolescents, but--that's how we get children out of wedlock, too.If you are a homeschooling parent or a Christian parent, you won't want to buy this book."
1,misleading product description,"Bought battery with belief that it was an APPLE produced battery based on item description: APPLE PowerBook G4 15"" (Aluminun) Main Battery. Upon receiving the battery it was obviously not Apple originated. Therefore, my Apple Protection Plan is negated."
4,Just like I remeber,"Just like I remember from 1989. No english cc, though. It said it had cc, but didn't have it in english."
3,WWE FAN,I REALLY THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS NOT GOOD .BUT WHEN IT WAS ON VHS IT ADDED THE MATCH WHICH WAS IN A CAGE AND I ENJOYED THAT.SO UNLESS THEY ADD THE MATCH ONTO THE DVD I REFUSE TO BUY IT.
5,Hulk Hogan Lives!!!!!,I just saw this movie on VHS and wondering why isn't it on DVD yet. This is a very good wrestling movie due to Hulk Hogan.Hulk Hogan is the best wrestler for 30 years. I really enjoyed this movie a lot.If you like Hulk Hogan riping shirt action this movie is for you. Get it were you can.
1,This game sucks.,"The levels even on the easiest level are insanly hard. There are NO health packs! The enemy almost never misses and sometimes they even seem to fire at you before you're even IN the doorway to shoot at them. They always see you first, and I could not get past the first level. This game SUCKS.I always play FPS games at the highest difficulty and I always finish the game. I've played the ""Halo"" series, ""Doom 3"", ""Quake"", ""Unreal"", ""Unreal Championship"", ""Black"", ""Farcry"" and many other shooter games. I always hold my own at the highest difficulty but this game ""The Road to Berlin"" is the WORST shooter game I have ever seen. DO NOT BUY."
1,A Videogame Catastrophe!,"This is utter garbage! You're better off using this as toilet paper than melting your brain cells playing this trash!Sure it's a budget game, but at least MOST budget games give you some sort of entertainment. THIS! This is torturous. Not only does it reek of bad game play, but the horrendous controls make this virtually unplayable.Don't even bother with the story. It's absent just like the AI. You'll see enemies running into walls, getting stuck on a rock, shooting at nothing...Let's just say that the AI is dumber than a doorknob.I was surprised that this game featured an online option. Usually crap games never give you that choice. But don't expect ANYONE on the servers! LOLConclusion: I'd rather eat pickles for the rest of my life than play a single second of this game. Save your 1 dollar for something more useful, like a dollar burger at McDonald's. - Mike G"
1,do not buy these headers!,"After working on cars since a teenager, and installing numerous sets of headers, this was a complete nightmare. We thought it would be better to put headers on rather than use the old exhaust manifolds after fixing a couple of broken exhaust studs. The headers are poorly designed, and after many tries to get the exhaust leak stopped, we finally found out that the drivers side needed an area ground down so it would seal completely. After having them off and on many times because the U pipe wouldn't seal, we found that the oil filter would be next to impossible to get off. We fought these crappy things for a couple months before we got it done. If you're determined to buy them anyway, be sure to invest in good header gaskets from Nissan, and also an oil filter relocation kit, as well as some header wrap and hose clamps to keep the U pipe from leaking. What should have been a day or so of work turned into weeks of frustration."
3,not sure how to rate this,"The book is well written, although a complex book for any one that does not know the Homeric and Epic Cycles, and for me personally nearly unreadable. Mainly to me I don't read for the scientific explanation or how things do and don't fit together, I'm a fan of the Aeneid, which is not part of either cycle nor should it be, but just a expansion of the story, as I feel all of the stories are, and not to be picked apart and dissected. Just simply to enjoy the story, if you pick at it too much it looses that flavor. This is a great book for a scholar, but in my opinion not for the average reader, there is no synopsis of the epic cycle, unless you count a page and a half that gives a very brief account. Please remember none of the stories from the ""Epic Cycle"" still exist to our knowledge, but the Iliad and the Odyssey do."
5,"Another great book from Mary-Margaret Moore and ""Bartholomew""","What a total blessing to enjoy the Bartholomew messages that are delivered thru Mary-Margaret Moore. (Check out her website for more info on what she's doing these days).This book is so full of TRUTH....it's just fabulous. It's a chronicle of a journey to India and Japan during which the travelers experienced the sacred Kalachakra Initiation (blessing) from His Holiness, the 14th Dalai Lama. All seekers and finders will enjoy the Bartholomew messages in this book AND ""From the Heart of a Gentle Brother"" and ""Reflections of an Elder Brother."" They are still in print and available from Amazon. Read and ""go big!"" -- touch the vastness which is your Self! Enjoy!"
5,Great Stuff,"This is the best stuff ever! Every time I feel a cold or sore throat coming on, I take this. It seems to knock out whatever was coming before it gets bad.I recommend this highly."
1,WHAT?!?!?!,"FIRST OF ALL WHY IN THE HELL DOES THIS ALBUM EXSIT?!THE IDEA OF A TRIBUTE TO BOB MARLEY IS COMPLETLY RIDCULOUS TO BEGIN WITH. COME ON PEOPLE, IT'S BOB MARLEY, NOT CHER OR SOMEONE ELSE MADE THIS ALBUM BECAUSE THEY JUST HAVE PROOF AND MORE THAN ONE HIT ALBUM UNDER THEIR BELT. THIS IS JUST PROOF THAT THOSE TEENAGE BLOPPERS ARE TAKING OVER AND IT'S HARDER UNAUTHORIZED TO FIND MUSIC BECAUSE LIKE THAT CRAP IS BEING REALEASED INSTEAD. SOMEBODY, PLEASE, HELP US!!!"
4,Finally a real world application!,"This book combines all the necessary elements, remoting, coding to interfaces, reusable code, to create a real world enterprise level application. The book takes difficult topics and applies them to the Northwind database which all developers are familiar with. This book is by no means a book for beginners. However, if you have a good understanding of Object Oriented application design then you should be okay. I took off one star because I felt there should be a little more background information on remoting to make using the sample application less frustrating. However, the author replied within a few hours and helped me troubleshoot my issue. All in all, a great, well-thought out book."
2,Poorly written,"Where is the big picture? It would have been nice if the Author would have mentioned what the sample application is supposed to do rather than just use a 'here, type this code in' approach. I can only assume he passed the 70-300 certification exam because it certainly does not show in his writing. I understood this book only because I have already written client/server applications myself. Woe to the reader who tries to use this book as a tutorial."
4,Definite Chill Mood!,"A good CD's for those laid back parties or for those days when you want to relax around the house and forget the days problems or the weeks problems and hurddles! Immerse yourself in the sounds with a glass of your favorite chilled chill and some of your favorite finger food! To bad there is no sample bar for this CD, it is a good CD and better then many of the other so called chill CD's!!!"
1,"Forget the CD Rom, buy the book","The book is great. The CD-Rom is an exercise in frustration. That you can only install it on a single computer is the first frustration. Then I tried to print a section for use in the shop. The pages that came out on the printer were not the pages that I requested (error between displayed and actual page numbers?). When I tried to print again, it said I had exceeded the printing limit."
2,Disgusting attitude towards loyal readers!?!,I am completely disappointed by this CD. It seems that I have to pay additional money (though small) to buy some kind of a key to be able to have access to all the material. I have never seen in my life such dumb software. How is possible such attitude towards customers? Why not prepare one complete package? DO NOT BUY THIS CD? Disgusting attitude towards loyal readers!
1,TOTALY USELESS,"This product is totaly useless to me....I wasted $75 on this junk. Nowhere in the advertisement or on the package did it say that your computer had to be on line to activate this software. the computer that this product is installed on is in a work station that can not be put on line. The only thing it did say on the package is that, once the package is opened it CAN NOT be returned. TOTALY USELESS TO ME....False advertisement as far as i'm conserned. Now al i have to do is, find out how in the hell i'm going to get my MONEY BACK"
3,"useful, though slightly awkward","While the unlocking of the CD's chapters is awkward, the CD still offers some advantages over the paper version of the book. The searching on the CD is much easier; trivial to find all instances of a term. The hardcopy's index simply can't match this.To be sure, not everyone likes reading lengthy sections of text on a computer. Hardcopy is still superior here. But for finding small sections, you might find the CD useful. Plus, it is easier to copy text snippets and diagrams to other documents, if the need arises."
1,Be Carefull,This product did not work for me. It's is an upgrade of a previous version but it was not mentionned on the website when I purchased it.
2,Bored And Bored AGAIN!!,SCEAM AND SCREAM again was something I saw a lot as a child and I never understood what was going on but I watched it anyone because it was VINCENT PRICE and it seemed to be a horror film. Well I watched it recently and on this very disc and still could not be able to tell you what the sub-plots in the movie are about. I could give you a vague guess and then tell you most of the movie is about a crazy scientist who is making super beings who live on blood. But it is SO BORING!! I don't know how I watched it so many times as a child. THE OBLONG BOX is my least favorite VINCENT PRICE movie so I cannot reccommend this under any circumstances when I refuse to own it myself. I immediately sold it after I watched it because I was so mortified by it's total lack of entertainment value.
3,"""The Oblong Box"" review (1969)","this film is based upon a story by Edgar Allan Poe. Starring Christopher Lee and Vincent Price.Vincent Price is a wealthy plantation owner who made his money in Africa. Lee is the local doctor who is fond of scientific experiments- on people, dead or otherwise. Obsessed with experimenting on more people, Lee hires a African voodoo man (who previously worked for Price) to poison Price's brother with a blow-dart, which doesn't kill him, but puts him in a sort of coma. Price, thinking his brother is dead, has him buried.His brother later wakes from his coma and begins to extract revenge on those that tried to kill him.* recommended *"
3,Oblong Box/Scream & Scream Again,"OK as horrors go. Liked Oblong Box better than Scream and Scream again. Altho, Scream had some bizarre acton and scenes/plots. Price great, as always.Cecy"
1,Dark Horses and Black Beauties,The author has an obvious chip on her shoulder when it comes to people who have more money than she does. I threw the book away.
2,victim of false advertising,"I felt exactly the same about this book as the reviewer from Gainsville. It hardly explores the relationship between women and horses,it simply describes centuries of cruelty inflicted upon them in a self-concious,pseudo artsy style. Whereas I feel there is a great need for people to be educated about the appauling way animals continue to be abused in the name of profit and entertainment(which amounts to the same thing)from horses to racing greyhounds,circus animals,meat animals,puppy mills and too many others to list here-that is not the way this book has been marketed. Look elsewhere for insight into our great love of horses."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,"This was by far the best ""horse"" book I have ever read. The first chapter gave me goosebumps and I couldn't put it down. A must read for any woman who owns a horse or loved one at one time and is debating on whether to do it again. How wonderful to hear your own thoughts and feelings expressed by someone you don't even know. I have recommended this book to all of my horse owning friends as a book they don't want to just borrow,but have as their very own so they can re-read it again and again."
2,Painful,"A horse owner and lover, I was given this book as a gift. Had it not been a gift I would have happily thrown it in the trash, but I kept reading in order to give the soon-to-be-asked-for book review. This book is dark, very dark. There are a few nice ""moments."" I kept waiting for the ""payoff"" for all the darkness and it never came. Overall I found it disturbing and wanted only to expunge it from my memory. There are other books that will be much more enlightening and enjoyable. Buy those."
3,Odd writing style,"Recently I read two Dickens novels (Our Mutual Friend and Little Dorrit) and enjoyed them greatly. I though I would read something by some literary scholar commenting on Dickens, generally. So I got this book, but did not read much of it. Chesterton has an odd writing style that does not help my comprehension or enjoyment of this thoughts. I thought he would have some sophisticated and deep observations about Dickens and his writing style, but very few were to be found. Rather than reflecting some comments that might shed light on Dickens even today, his comments were merely the usual comparisons that any reviewer might offer of an author then living and writing. So this book did not offer the far-seeing wisdom that Dickens deserves."
2,"Can you say ""lesbian cliche?""","I wasn't as impressed with this book as some others have been. The characters and the friendships were under-developed and the entire book was dialogue. And how many times can the author say the word ""lesbian"" on each page? I wouldn't recommend running out for this one unless you're looking for a quick read filled with cliches, stereotypes, and old jokes."
5,Laugh out loud Literally,"I picked up this book because it sounded light and fun. If you like ""Sex and the City"" or even some of the fast paced remarks of ""Gilmore Girls"" you'll love this book. It is well written, fast paced, and easy to read. The only warning I have is to make sure you are reading this in a place that laughing out loud won't cause a scene. I made the mistake of taking this with me to the dentist office and to a restaurant to read. When you burst out laughing and can't seem to get it under control people think your crazy. And this book will have you doing it, lots of it, if you get to a comment one of the girls may say that makes you laugh plan to keep it up for a couple of pages. Would love a sequal."
2,Well. . .,"After reading Dean's other novelIt's In Her Kissthis was a big disappointment. I could not relate to a single character! Even the african american character (who I should have related to) was flat, mousy, and sometimes irritating. There were a lot of played upon assumptions that most lesbians are walking butches being lead around like nameless, faceless cattle. I am not sure where Dean was trying to go with this book, but it missed the mark with me. I was/am hard pressed to finish the last few pages of the book and I have been troughing through it for 6 months!"
5,It's a reference book,"This is an exhaustive guide to research reference sources. Lots of information is presented between its covers. I feel certain that it must still contain some things that are hard to find on the internet, but I have not personally verified this."
5,Quickly shipped / Perfect condition,This product shipped quickly (arrived earlier than estimated) and arrived in perfect condition. Thank you.
2,Cracked after 18 months,"Comes with 2 zip ties that fit fine. Boot was made of high quality and sturdy material. I used a bit of silicone lubricant spray to get it on. Had a little mixup, with the wrong boot being sent to me, but Amazon corrected it and overnighted me a replacement.UPDATE 6/26/11. The inner lip (on the rack side) of both boots I purchased have developed some cracking. It doesn't affect the functionality of the boot, as it's just folding over a zip tie, but it isn't comforting. I'll keep an eye on it. The rest of the boot is in good shape and able to protect the inner tie rod end and steering rack.UPDATE 6/24/12. After 18 months of use, the boots are cracked all over. They have a little life left, but they will need to be replaced soon. I'd suggest looking at other boots."
4,Right on!,"I agree with all previous reviews, if you dig the Allmans and Govt Mule, you will dig this CD. It is with the current southern, progressive jam vibe. His take on the Marley classic ""No Woman No Cry"" is a highlight. Take a chance on this newcomer and enjoy!"
3,Not The Class act I expected,"I ,was not aware that Levi Stubbs was not performing at this time ,it was not stated,that there were so many new members in the group (3).This was not the class act that I expected and experinced from earlier performances. You do not have to have orginal members in order to continue to have a class act."
2,Off/On Switch Already Broken!,"Reviewer edit: This is already defective, I'm returning it.First things first: this is NOT dimmable. There is a cheap off/on switch that has two settings, low and and high. The switch is already acting wanky. I have to turn it several times to get it to turn on.I was surprised this was $70. Cheap crap from China I suppose.Like other reviewers, I used to have a great high watt dimmable halogen floor lamp. It appears these are not made any longer due to fire hazard.If I could find a good one for over $100 I wouldn't mind the price. I guess I'll to shop at brick and mortar stores and test drive them."
1,cheapo,"The power switch has not worked properly ever at all (not once). You have to jiggle and go all turny with it to make it work.It is disgusting it ships with such a defective switch.--- BIG NEWS ___ UPDATE ___ READNOW ---The switch no longer works at all! I repeat: the gosh-blarged switch no longer functions at all.Dear Adesso,I hate you.Yours aplenty,xxx"
3,Not recommended,"Mandriva One is a kind of stripped down operating system for users new to Linux.It has basic programs included--like Office Writer (which easily interprets Word for Windows files)--Linux web browsers, firewalls, calculators, email clients and so on. But for the fancy stuff, users need a more comprehensive system such as Mandriva 2007, or the Mandriva 2007 Power Pack. The Spring 2007 version of Mandriva 2007 includes KDE 4.0.After trying Mandriva One on a new machine several months ago, I can only say, I don't recommend it. It's too basic, and not worth it, now that Mandriva has worked out some of the bugs from its newest 2007 generation."
3,Comment on previous review,Mandriva One is a stripped-down version because it is to be run through the ram and cd or dvd player on your computer. The live version are usable as an installed OS. If you are interested search Linux google and check out a current review on Mandriva Free.
3,Great movie DVD couldn't live up.,"This is one of the great action film in 80's.Unfortunately, it only comes with full screen versionand stereo surround. It does not have any extra such asinterview, deleted scines, nor making of.I just have to say ""What were you thinking MGM?"
4,A Must See for Porsche Lovers!!,"Good acting, goo damount of action, ok, but preditable plot. Charlie Sheen and D.B. Sweeny must share the screen with the real stars. The various Porsches. My favorite is the black 930 Turbo slant nose, gorgeous!! As an owner of an 1987 911 Carrera, I am a bit biased towards this movie, but even for non Porsche lovers, it is a pretty good flick."
4,Decent Entertainment,"This movie has two very good-looking stars (Sheen and Sweeney) and beautiful fast cars, and a decent plot. That's enough for an entertaining movie. Charlie Sheen is one of those actors who can play the bad guy with such charm that you want to root for him. This one is worth a look."
1,I RECIVED WRONG MOVIE,I RECIVED WRONG MOVIE.... I RECIVED STAR WARS 1And i am not intressted in Star Wars.... How do we solve this problem????
4,Winning,"All recent Sheen propaganda aside, this is a great movie. It is a true 80's cult classic; air cooled 911 Porsches, digital synthesizer soundtrack worthy of a Depeche Mode comparison, and enough 80's style to make me raid my old wardrobe. All the stunt driving is real, no CGI and no lame neon color effects. It's the same old story of a cop who gets too close to his target, and faces the dillemma of who's side he's really on. We all know how it ends, but its safe to say if Ted Varrick (Sheen's Character) had been in Wall Street instead of Bud Fox, Varrick and Gekko would never have gotten caught and they'd both be living in Monaco with a dozen mistresses and 2 dozen stolen cars each."
3,"Interesting, but problems with text related to digitization and no proofing","This is an interesting account, and fairly well written. The text, however, has many spelling errors that sometimes confound the author's intended meaning. It appears the text was digitized using an automatic program and not proofread afterwards."
3,"good collection, but that's all","I wish this Cliff collection had more on it to offer, but at lest the tracks on here, including the amazing ""Vietnam,"" ""Many Rivers to Cross,"" ""Better Days Are Coming,"" and ""You Can Get It If You Really want,"" are essential Cliff.For a very compact best of, this disc is good, though a tad overpriced for the limited amount of material on it. There are many best of packages out there for Cliff. Go find another one."
3,Get to it!,"I'd never heard of the arrows until I found out that they were the first to perform ""I Love Rock N Roll"" I say that the original is always the best way to go, which isn't to say that Joan Jett didn't do a good job, but I like originals."
5,What to do,This book will save your child (grandchild) unnecessary trips to the doctor or ER and set your mind at ease about being a responsive care giver.
5,Yulia,"If you enjoyed Hayley Westenra's CDs then try Yulia.She has a beautiful voice.Songs sung in russian,english,maori & italian.Traditional songs like Scarborough Fair,pop songs such as Sarah Mclachlan's Angel sung with a magical voice.Members of The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra accompany her singing.Where Hayley is popular in NZ and touted as a talent now overseas,Yulia ,in my opinion is for those with a more sophisticated taste in pop classic al music, if there is such a thing."
1,Workbook for Prego!,I actually found this book hard to use. It did not correspond very well with the textbook in my opinion.
4,Very helpful,"This workbook is extremely helpful for anyone learning italian. if you keep up with the exercises, you are bound to speak the language quickly!"
2,not happy with this item,I do not like the looks or quality of this item . I do not care for these pants. would not recommend.
1,I hate it when availability is restricted to 1x or larger.,Nothing like finding the perfect item for my husband and then finding that the sizes available are for men sizes 1x or larger. Unfair when all he wants is a pair of jeans he can wear again without having to worry about zippers and buttons. Disappointing!
2,Watch the Packaging - 4 to an envelope,"What I was expecting were individually wrapped tea bags. They come 4 to an envelope, so once you open it the others are exposed to the air. They definitely can not be used in a public setting where no one knows who originally opened it or how long it has been open. I suppose they would be good for batch brewing at home."
5,Love This Peppermint Tea!,What can I say? This tea is delicious and calming....it is wonderful during any season! Love it! :)
5,"A Desert Island Disc, I say!!","This is one of those albums that will always stay with you. Rocksteady's true reign (1965-68), between Ska and Reggae, is perfectly distilled in this compilation. Quality is excellent, unlike many Jamaican compilations you find. You will never find these elsewhere and they're all gems. If you only know Jamaican music from Ska and Reggae, try this. I love it, I play it for friends, I even play it for my inlaws and they love it. I highly recommend it.EdHead"
5,great cd,Wish i knew about this cd sooner. Great collection of uplifting music to listen to. Approved for my son to listen to on his mission also.
3,Douay Rheims Bible ISBN 978-1-935302-03-2,"Very nice Bible, with the exception not as pictured. Wanted the solid black cover, instead received it with gold lettering. Guess have to live with it."
2,Not the Genuine Leather one,"This Bible is great when it's bound in genuine leather. The older edition of this Bible uses bonded leather. I ordered this thinking that the description was accurate (as ""GENUINE LEATHER""). I was sent the older edition, the black bonded leather (I am not talking about the Ultrasoft)."
3,What you see is not what you get,"The Bible in the leading picture is nothing like the Loreto Bible listed from allcatholicbooks, which has no further discription. I thought I ordered a leather Bible with gilt edges and colored maps, edited by Gibbons. What I got was a hard-covered book looking nothing like the photo. It also has plain white paper edges with black and white maps, and is not edited by Gibbons. The Loreto Bible itself has clear print with only a few wrinkled pages and is a joy to read. It is simply nothing like the photo shown."
3,Less than expected,"This Douay-Rheims bible was somewhat disappointing, not because of the translation, which is by far my favorite version, but because of the physical aspects of the bible. I found the type size too small for comfortable reading, and the print not as bold and dark as it could have been. Also the bible does not stay open and flat on the desktop so you always have to hold it with both hands. The ""Genuine Leather"" cover does not have the thickness and feel of high-quality leather, and the binding seems weak and liable to tear with regular use."
4,Beautiful translation,"To me, there is no finer translation of Scripture than the Douay-Rheims Bible. This large-print edition is so much easier to read than my pocket-size, leather-bound copy, and I am enjoying more time in the Scriptures as a result. My only wish is that the covers were made of sturdier material, and I would have paid a little more for that. Otherwise, this is now my reading/study bible. It's great."
3,Great pictures light on new insights,"This is a great visual atlas of what chiropractors believe is the ""cause"" of what ails the masses. It is difficult to argue with the author when it comes to what a subluxation is since he has assembled photographs to support his point. However, one is left without any new insight into what exactly this subluxation ""thing"" is based on the text. Pictures are nice, but what about an analysis?"
5,A fabulous read,"Mr. Bruni's prose has the uncanny ability to make a reader feel as though you're sitting comfortably at home having a thoroughly enjoyable conservation with someone who just happens to know a great deal about the way politicians and journalists think and work. This book is filled with telling little gems about President Bush -- the kinds of things you'd just love to share with your colleagues at the water cooler, because they're interesting, funny and they're bound to make you look smart.Thank you, Mr. Bruni for letting us into the ""bubble"" of presidential campaigns."
4,An objective look at the 2000 Presidential Contest.,"I liked this book because it paints the good and bad about George W. Bush. Bruni covered the Bush Campaign for the New York Times. In this book, he reveals the real George Bush and the close election of 2000. There were lots of colorful insight and also jokes played during this campaign. What this book revealed was an uncomplicated man who was seeking the presidency. Bush also could laugh at himself, including his fumbling of the English language. The Presidency was not his all consuming passion as it was for Al Gore. This knowledge validated my vote for Bush.Bruni covers only the campaign and the aftermath of the election. There is only a little background history of Bush before his presidential run. There are no photos in this book. The book is strictly a look at Bush's run for the White House in 2000."
1,Shallow &#65533;journalism.&#65533;,"Frank Bruni's book is indicative of where `journalism' is heading these days. Short on real analysis of the issues and more inclined to view elections as mere `beauty contests,' Bruni's book is long of fluff and short on depth. This book is a must to avoid but could be of interest for journalism's students who wish to see how awful mainstream journalism has become."
1,Ambling into History,"While the President comes off as someone I would like to know, I don't believe Bruni really gets him. Some aspects, yes. The easier to get ones. For instance the Presidents sillyness and his lesser known penchant for reading. What he doesn't get, in my opinion, is why the President is not aware of certain generation X trivia questions. While Titan and Balkan Ghosts are relevant and interesting to an inquisitive mind, people and friends are, to put it kindly, empty and a waste of precious time. Having read this book I hope to return it and get my money back and replace it with something more complete and challenging."
4,Good but Could've Been Better,"Bruni's book was very interesting and entertaining, especially the amusing tidbits about Bush on the campaign trail. I did find information that I'd never uncovered before, like Bush's SAT scores (in the 1200s) and family relationship. However, at certain points Bruni seemed a little condescending and incredulous about things that only an urban (read: elitist) reporter could be condescending and incredulous about. For example, Bush does not know Sex and the City. I know very few people who know of the show and even fewer who watch it, especially since many do not get HBO on cable. (alert, reporters!!) There were a few points where the author got in backhanded slaps at Bush. It was entertaining, but can yield negative spin about things that don't really matter at all. He also seemed pulled in too many directions, like a general critique of the media. All in all, I thought the few tidbits about Gore and his wife were more interesting than the ones about Bush and co."
1,A reporter seduced,"Bruni's book is noteworthy for its unwitting chronicle of this political reporter's seduction by his subject: George W. Bush. Bruni got considerable ""face-time"" with Bush the Candidate, and found him to be an amusing ""regular guy."" Bruni gives Bush considerable credit for this achievement. Was Bruni so cowed by the WASP oligarchy that ""they're just people too"" was a revelation to him? Did the nerdy and skeptical Bruni doubt his own ability to pass for a ""regular guy?""Bill Clinton possessed an impressive ability to befriend and manipulate reporters who covered him. Once these reporters awoke from the spell cast upon them, some were able to write objectively about the Clinton presidency.""Ambling into History"" demonstrates that Bruni isn't sufficiently awake yet to assess Bush the Man, let alone Bush the President."
2,Explains the doofus behind the SMIRK!,This president has the sensibilities of a fratboy at a kegger. The intellectual horsepower needed for the job of President will never be his. Reading this book makes one ponder how this stooge puppet of oil and gas cartels can truely do anything except stumble over his own ineptness.
2,What you need to know = this is a NY Times reporter,"Thats really all you need. Balanced? Yeah, I have this bridge over here .. .."
5,Simply a wonderful resource for Vonnegut fans and students.,"This compilation of interviews with Kurt Vonnegut covers 1969 through 1987. Vonnegut fans may recognize some of the conversations from amongst the known corpous (i.e. the Playboy interview from Foma, Wampeters, and Granfalloons) but by and large these come from quirky sources out of the main stream. The wonderfully casual Robert Scholes interview from 1973 is a delight. Also of interest is the 1974 Greg Mitchell piece written in the manner of Kilgore Trout. By all mean secure yourself a copy of this work. One flaw needs to be noted: With Vonnegut married to the skillful photographer Jill Kremetz, why put a pedestrian AP photo on the cover?Chris Huber"
2,The book wasn't well organized,"The book does give great interviews and words of Vonnegut, but there is no substantial whole. It is poorly laid out, and makes no concrete assertions or comments on Vonnegut's words."
5,ACDelco MU1415 Control Module Assembly,This product works flawlessly. It was easy to install and it was the lowest price I found. Notice I didn't say it was the cheapest price I could find. Cheap is not always a good thing. It is an OEM ACDelco part and is the quality you should expect. All this product needs is a nice picture to display it properly.
2,Not what I expected,I wanted a reference book that I could refer to on how to write a variety of business letters.
1,laughing at children,"The coldness of the cover powerfully conveys the contents. He is a sensitive artist but an insensitive writer.Readers aren't laughing with the child. They are laughing at the child. This child hears so many things incorrectly that this goes beyond the normal level. All children make some of these mistakes. This child makes too many of them. The child could easily have a hearing handicap or a language handicap.The illustrator does a really powerful job of making us feel the sadness, isolation, and confusion of the child but the text shows no sensitivity to the child's feelings. The book could help the child learn to laugh at her mistakes but it just encourages other children and adults to laugh at the child who feels isolated and misunderstood.The art work is makes readers feel what the child feels. I wish the text did."
2,The waste of a skilled writer,"Nobody can deny that Alice Munro is a very skilled author. You can see all her experience at The New Yorker. Nonetheless, this book's lack of an interest story just throws that away. The most interesting character, Flo, appears in few occasions, while Rose is sometimes a very flat character. Probably the book doesn't deepen much in her other than her relationships with men. It serves the feminist purpose but not quite the literary. It should be considered as a possible weekend entertainment, just like reading magazine fiction."
5,Capture women's experiences,"Alice Munro has so many published stories and over a long stretch of time and with numerous awards, yet this was the first collection I have read. I ordered five others after reading this collection. That is my highest compliment to a writer. I want to see if there is a pattern or progression to her writing. Her stories are crisp, pack a lot of emotion without being overly sentimental. I think she gives a special voice n this collection to late middle age women--women who know life is not a straight line of life events, but a curvy road with dead ends, retreats, and avenues of full speed ahead occasionally. I am recommending this (or another collection after I read some of her others) to the retirement-age women n my book club"
3,"Good, until you hit good speed","Works well for general use, but if you plan to run 18MPH or higher for long spans of time, I would not recommend. It pops around and comes loose at higher speeds."
3,Remove when towing,"This top works well when the Ranger is off the trailer going at it's speed. I twice tried to tow the Ranger on a trailer going 55 MPH down the highway. The first time one corner came loose and started flapping, I thought it was just me not installing properly. The next time it tore one of the straps loose, pulled the velcro from the roll bar and shredded the rear of the top (I didn't catch it quite as soon as the previous time). It does only take a couple of minutes to put the top on and take it off so I guess that would be the best practice, but I don't want to mess with it every time so I guess I will have to go with a hard top."
3,The problem is the processor...,"This little wonder has it all: Windows Mobile 5.0, bluetooth, Infrared, WIFI b/g, a decent keyboard, pushmail, MiniSD card slot, decent speakers, plays audio and video, touchscreen, 2 MP camera, Pocket Office. It's the perfect do-it-all device. However it has two major glitches: the screen is very small, and the main processor (TI OMAP850 200Mhz) is just too slow to run the system. Other than that, I would recommend this phone to anybody."
4,Perfect For Beginers,"I have taken a class on postmodern literature and read several books on postmodernism. I had difficulty understanding until I read this book. For anyone that doesn't have a clue about postmodernism, this is the place to begin."
2,The Life of Christ,"This is a classic book, but the print was so small that I have to use a magnifying glass to read it, thus rendering it useless."
1,9 d's,I was very disappointed in this book - the printing was terrible and the footnotes weren't there like they should have been. It took a long time to be delivered and was well packaged (the one good thing about the experience) but I was purchasing it for a gift and have had a hard time finding this item and was so delighted when I did and then to have this happen. Major hesitation to order new things!!!
5,Raw But Real American History,"Mrs. Ida B. Wells-Barnett should be as well known as Soujourner Truth or Rosa Parks. This was one revolutionary heroine! She was run out of Memphis for writing boldly about lynchings in the 1890s. She also did an in-depth study on lynching called ""A Red Record"" (included here) that told the truth about this practice on a national level. Another excellent segemnt teels the forgotten true tale of Robert Charles, who unsucessfully stood up to a New Orleans Lynch mob in 1900 using credible primary sources (see als William Ivy Hair's ""Carnival of Fury"" on that subject). This is the history you didn't get from your high-school teacher! READ it!"
5,I finally found them.,"After searching every home improvement store in the area, I decided to go online to purchase one instead. This was a great price for 3, and it works just fine."
4,Very useful - saves money,"When the Honda dealer told us it would cost about $200 to change our front wheel breaks, my wife and I decided to do it ourselves. We got some break pads for about $40 from the auto parts store (better quality than what the dealer would have used) and we bought this book for about $20.This book, coupled with a c-clamp and a screwdriver saved us $140. Money well spent."
5,Handy to have,"This manual is handy to have on hand and has had everything I have needed it for thus far. I am not one who does everything on my vehicles, but try to do at least some basics and it is clear enough for me to understand for the most part."
3,Good as Costume Only,"Beads come off and it is really not for serious dancing. I love the way it looks, but it doesn't come in a size small, which would have fit me better. If fixed it myself. Eventually, if I use it for belly dancing, I think sll the beads will fall off."
1,No Hope for This Product,Our neighbor has called animal control over our barking 15 lb. dog so went to PetCo and bought this.1. Suspected problem when unit start up did not include the orange LED flash specified in the manual.2. Put in new battery - thinking it could be low. No change in barking.Called customer service to find they are redoing the manual and what else could they say?How about a refund? Absolutely no bark control with this model.
2,Giving back to the communtiy,"Well, I dont normally provide feedback but I feel its time to give back to the community. I chose this collar based on its pleasant design and ignored the lower feedback rating for the review. This wasnt my normal methodology for choosing a product. I typically look for 4 or 5 stars. So, I only have myself to blame. Anyhow, the bark collar isnt as effective as one would expect. My dog is normally quiet unless someone approaches the house, rings the bell or knocks on the door. It worked at first. Day 1 barking, caused a response from the collar and the dog yelped. Not sure if it was very painful or the dog was just surprised. However, by week two, he still barks whenever he feels like, albeit, less often. So, if you're looking for a less frequent barking, this product may be for you. if you want your dog to learn to stop barking at the mail man or other visitors, this may not be the right collar."
2,Collar Too Stiff,"I bought this for a miniature dachshund, so her neck is about six or seven inches around. This collar worked for her barking, but the fit was terrible. The collar is made of a stiff rubber and is all one piece, so it cannot be put on a more flexible collar. When it is adjusted to her small size, the buckle and barking device make the collar an odd shape, so the barking device does not stay by her throat unless it is adjusted so tightly that the prongs on the device press too hard into her throat. It works for her barking, but I would buy a different style of collar for a dog with a very small neck."
1,Worthless,"This item is worthless on small animals. The collar's plastic is too rigid for a 6lb dog's neck. If you keep it tight, it only shifts around to the side of their neck. I've had this for almost a year and it's only worked a handful of times. Do not waste your money. I spent the extra money on this model because I thought that it was more humane - now I'm just a moron that's out $80."
1,save your money - would not recommend,This collar spins around our dog's neck (9lb dog) and fails to measure vibration of the constant bark and therefore no correction. The collar is plastic and unable to be fastened tightly enough to stay in place and keep the mechanism at the throat. It is useless by design and ineffective at giving a correction. We would not recommend this product.
4,"Well, I thought I was getting something else....","The description didn't mention the use of static as a correction technique, but I guess that was my fault for not asking. I didn't want a shock collar. It was a bit dirty, but otherwise it appears to be working well, the one time I used it."
1,PetSafe Little Dog Bark Collar,"This product simply did not work on our Welsh Corgi. No matter how tight the collar was, or how short I shaved her neck, she rarely recieved any correction. As stated in other reviews, the collar moves too easily and unless it is perfectly positioned, on practically bare skin, at all times, you won't get consistent results. Customer support said the probes can't be longer because of the design. I think that says it all...poor design for the money. What a waste!"
1,Don't get this for little dogs!,"I bought this collar over a year ago for my min pin and it simply does not work. It has to stay directly on the front of the throat very tightly for it to work and this is impossible on a little dog. Even when put on very tightly, the collar shifts to the side so that the sensor is no longer directly on my dog's throat and will not be able to detects his barks. It's worked before for a minute or two but then shifts to the side and dog just barks away. Don't waste your money on this very expensive collar that does not work. I am going to try a citronella spray collar instead."
1,Never again,"I had the misfortune of purchasing this collar. This collar is a disaster for a few reasons. First, the collar does not stay in place over the voice box. Because of the rigidity and shape of the collar and the fact that the heavy buckle is on the side of the collar, the collar will ride up and sit on the side of the dogs neck rendering it useless. Second, even when it is positioned correctly, it doesn't work. Perhaps it is the battery (which I replaced twice) or internally it is broken. Either way, stay away from this mess of a product. Petsafe should be ashamed of the poor quality."
2,Zap,"It doesn't zap the yap of our newly adopted Pomeranian mix. Although we have seen her jump once or twice and it appeared to be the zap that did it, but it didn't slow her down much. We did everything according to directions, and even shaved a spot on her neck to help make better contact. We have used the shock trainer collar on our mastiff mix and it worked extremely well. I'm disappointed with this bark collar though."
1,Terrible,"Bought this after using a similar model some years ago. The problem with this one is both the sound and vibration have to be at the right ""frequency"" to illicit a shock. It has never worked. I would not recommend this product."
1,Save Your Money,"We've had several bark collars over the years for our dogs. After a year, and trying it on two dogs, this is by far the worst purchase ever! Collar itself is poorly designed; an overly complicated buckle AND quick release set up made with cheap, stiff plastic that does not conform to a ""little dog's"" neck at all. Being stiff, the overly-light sensor is easily rubbed off the dog's throat (my dogs are not stupid!) where it doesn't give any correction. After all, the dog needs to be able to breathe -- how tight can a collar be? The only thing the special, expensive battery does is power the flashing ""on"" light - constantly. At least I can find my Cairn Terrier in the dark - that is, if she isn't already out there barking. Phooey!"
1,didn't work,Bought two. Didn't work for either dog. Followed the directions to the 't' but it never deterred even one bark. Huge waste of money.
1,Not impressed,I have purchased this collar twice. Both times my Beagle wasn't eveb phased. She would continue to bark even with the collar on and working.She was also able to shake and roll on the grass enough to get it turn around so it would even work.It never worked either time and it was a complete waste of money and it isn't a cheap collar either. I would not try this one again!!
2,Doesn't work well on 7 lb dogs,"Got this for our 6 1/2 lb Papillon, who barks at everything. The only way I can keep the prongs right on her throat is by making it really tight. I don't feel comfortable (her neither I'm sure) having it that tight on her throat for any length of time. If it was lighter weight it might work better."
1,Waste of money,"This collar was a complete waste of money. It looks to be very well made and effective, but looks can be very deceiving. While this collar may be effective if it stays properly positioned on the dog's neck, I wouldn't know because the collar always rotates so that the device is on the side of the dog's neck, not under the neck where it should be. I could not make the collar fit any tighter without closing off the dog's airway. Don't waste your money on this product because you will have to buy another collar once you see that this one is ineffective. In the garbage it goes!"
1,"Had to return 2 collars, did not work at all","I purchased two of these collars and had to return both. They were working fine but had no effect on the barking. I would assume the self adjusting correction feature sets itself at a very low stimulation level and there is no way to manually turn up the correction. My 2 barkers went off barking like usual, and other than noticing a slight correction from the collar, kept on barking. The collars also have an automatic shut off, so the dogs simply learned to bark till they shut the collars off, then kept on barking. A design flaw also forces the box on the collar to constantly slide onto the side of the neck, so it does not pick up any vibration from barking. No matter how you adjust it, the box slide back to the side within minutes. Biggest waste of money ever."
2,Review 1 of 2,I haven't had a chance to review this yet because it arrived with a virtually dead battery. The only positive thing I can say is there was enough charge in the battery to provide a red blinking light enough times to indicate it was dead (rathe than the device was totally defective).Note it's virtually impossible on Amazon to contact the vendor to get a replacement battery. It's return it or nothing. So beware of ordering this product.
1,total waste of money!,it doesn't work at all! I have 2 chihuahuas and the collar always slides to the side. it has never once picked up the sound or the vibration as it claims. save your money.
2,petsafe bark collar - comfort fit,"Purchased this collar for our bichon-poo, he is a little yippy at times. Collar worked fine for about a week, then he started barking again, replaced the battery that cost $10.00, I figured we had a defective battery. Same thing, worked for a week and then the barking started again. Not sure what the problem is, but it seems like the battery only lasts a short time, the dog is not barking when the collar is working so he is not what is causing the battery to run down. Will be returning collar to place of purchase (not amazon) and will buy a different brand, such as Innotek. E-mailed Petsafe without any response."
1,"Bad Idea, bad design!!!","The one piece, hard plastic collar, for small dogs, is the worse possible idea for a bark collar. It easily rotates around the dog's neck, won't stay in place, and does not make proper contact in order for it to work. Even when I tightened the collar to where it nearly choked him, my dog barked all he wanted.Petsafe has other bark collars that work just fine on small dogs, for the same price or less. Just be sure it has a flexible, fabric collar."
3,Didn't stop barking completely,"I was hoping for better results from the barking collar. Although it seems to help a little, there are still times when the collar doesn't seem to startle my dog enough to get him to stop barking. I would not purchase it again, knowing what I know about it, and the cost of it."
2,Sporadic Functionality,"The collar worked well the first couple days then virtually stopped working. I trim the fur around the dog's neck and tightened the collar, but it seems to rarely deliver any correction. It also slips to the side frequently"
3,"Corrects dog well, but breaks easily","I am about to buy my third one because of two reasons - it works very well at correcting my dog, so I trust it, but unfortunately, I keep buying more because it keeps breaking. But if you wear something 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for months, I guess you can expect some wear and tear. So I just learned now that I can buy it for $20 cheaper at Amazon as compared to PetSmart, so I'm elated."
1,"Inefective, poor design",This collar was designed for little dogs. It is made from a very stiff material (vinyl)that will not form to the dogs neck. The buckle is heavier than the electronmics so the collar is always rotated out of position and will not work correctly. After some extensive modifications and removeing the heavy buckle I did get it on the dog. Unfortunately the dog is too stupid to figure out to stop barking. The collar shocked the dogs voice box into a non functioning state but the dog is still to stupid to shut up.
1,buyer beware!!,"my dog barks excessively when im not around he is a bichon and 6pounds, we tried trainers and practically everything!! nothing worked! so i read into bark collars, since he is small i decided to get this one. being so happy when it came in and soooo disappointed once i used it this thing sucks! its worthless!! my dog barks LOUD when its on or off no difference at all!!"
3,"Great beginning, bad endingGreat beginning, bad ending","Like the other O'Reilly book on Eclipse this book starts great, but then ends up off topic. In this case the first eight chapters cover basic Eclipse use from installation, through creating Java projects, refactorting code, and integrating with ANT. The book then turns sharply into basic Java project implementation, which is better covered in any number of Java books. This goes on from chapters eight through twelve, and only comes back to Eclipse specific in the last two chapters which cover writing plugins.This is better than the other O'Reilly book, but I would have liked it to have stayed on course and to cover some of the more standard plugins that are being used in the wild. Great beginning, bad ending. I would recommend this as an introduction to Eclipse for anyone unfamiliar with IDEs, but this recommendation comes with the aforementioned reservations."
3,too much padding,"The book has some useful information, but does notgo beyond the very basic. In light of this, it isannoying that so much space is taken up with repeatedsamples of the same code, and with more screen shotsthan are needed. I've encountered this before in oneof Mr. Holzner's books (XML Complete), and I have towonder if this is done to pad the book to a lengththat justifies the cost."
2,The Documentation is better,"The documentation that comes with eclipse has as much, if not more, information as this book. And it is free.I am returning the copy I pre-ordered.I usually prefer O'reilly, but this is not Perl Cookbook."
4,Good book for those use to simpler editors,I was use to using a much simpler editor for writing Java code. This book did a very good job helping with learning how to use Eclipse.
2,"Why can't you tell us it is ""made in china""?","I purchased this pair of lamps because the description made it seem that they were high quality american. But when I found out that they were made in china, I thought about returning them. I will say that they appear to be adequate quality for the price, which was my major concern, but I am tired of the description painting a pretty picture just to find out differently! If the product is ""Made somewhere other than America"" it needs to be stated that way. Why is it necessary to deceive the consumer? We are Americans! We can make an informed decision! Vendors!!! Please put some honesty and integrity back into our country and start stating the TRUTH!!!"
3,product good but shipping not as advertised,"I ordered this product as a birthday present and I paid quite a bit extra for expedited shipping. The website said that with the faster shipping it would arrive in 3-5 business days, which would be in time for the birthday. After I paid my money and it was on it's way, I checked the tracking and they had put it on UPS ground even though expedited shipping was listed. It ended up taking 8 business days and was too late for the birthday. To their credit, they reimbursed my shipping charges, but it was upsetting. If they can't deliver as promised, they should change the shipping info on the website.The lamp itself looks really great. The only negative is that when you actually light it, the top lid becomes black from the heat of the flame."
1,Concept is good but device doesn't transfer all photos!,"I purchased this to be able to transfer my photos from a media card so I could eliminate buying more media cards. The device is the right size, fits in the palm of your hand, but doesn't transfer ALL the photos. I tried transferring photos from the same media card three times to a different media card. I erased the second media card for each attempt so there was a clean receiving media card on each transfer. Every time I transferred photos the device failed to transfer all the photos. Each time it was different photos that didn't transfer. I'm returning this product."
1,Good idea bad product,"I bought this, just like most others, with the idea of copying CF cards to a portable drive when we are on a long vacation trip. Well first thing is that it only works with hard drives formatted to FAT, and who wants to reformat their NTFS drive for this device. When it does work it is slow and unreliable, you will never know if the files were copied or not.The Memorex device on sale here on Amazon looks like the exact same device but I don't know if it has the same limitations. It is cheaper."
1,Nothing New Here,"If you like books on hidden history and are at all knowledgable about WW2 you will find this book a lame rehash of what you already know. If you are new to the idea that the US is not perfect and want to know how we got to the point where we are now the world's ""only superpower"" (and oft-times a ""bully""), then this will be a helpful, easy, introduction. It gives a cursory background to the start of the Cold War."
1,"Horrid, trite, hash","This would be great reading if you never read a newspaper. Love the number of second- and third-party sources of information. This has a fine premise, but with such bias, backpedaling and banana peels, you're better off heading straight for the big guns of progressive thought. Save your energy; go read Zimm. Mickey Z, do yourself a favor and go back to college."
5,jingle sticks,"These are great, my daughter is music therapist and uses these in her therapy sessions"
1,Fooled by the title,"This book is a trick! If I got to see this book in person, I would not have bought it! From the cover and brief description, I thought it would be a good guide on how risk management should be done in a corporate environment. It is no more than a ""dictionary"" of risk management and security terms. It doesn't tell you anything about how to do an risk assessment and BCP.The materials covered are out of date also. It is a waste of money."
5,A great resource for creating my companies Disaster Plan!,"I am the disaster recovery planner for a large company. This book was a great tool when I began creating the DR plan for my company. It is so easy to read and follow. Anything that you need to know is at your fingertips. The alphabetical format makes navigation a breeze. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is responsible for the recovery of his or her business, or even his or her home. Whether you are a professional planner, or just curious about the industry, this book can be of use to you."
2,Review of Encyclopedia of Disaster Recovery,"The book is somewhat outdated and needs to be revised, especially the statistical data. The book is a black and white copy so it makes the graphs, which were originally in color, difficult to read."
2,Stuff is Missing on this one,"No comments on the film, but the DVD is probably not a good choice for anyone who has seen this film before, even if only on T.V.One of the best scenes, the dinner in the Chinese restaurant is hacked up and missing my favorite lines in the film. Also, for anyone watching with Spanish audio track engaged, the dub of the conversation between Bunz and Lysterine is in Spanish and not Chinese. Kinda blows the point of that sketch. I guess one needs to beware of DVD's from Columbia Pictures as much as those from Disney."
2,Don't waste your time... or your money,"This is got to be the stupidest film I've ever seen. I am surprized that Vivica Fox, who is a reputable actress, even consented to do this movie. The only good thing about it is the lengths these guys were going to to get condoms. Other than the safe sex message, this film is wack. They should have just called it BOOTY, 'cause that's what it is."
4,Very funny ;-),"Sure, this isn't Oscar material, but it is very funny. I saw it years and years ago, and yesterday picked up a copy for under $10 at the mall so I grabbed it. I laughed as much as I did back then.There is plenty of humour, raunch and mishaps here. Jamie Foxx about steals the show and Vivica A Fox is the set up for him. Each dislikes each other at the start, but soon things heat up. His best friend is finally gonna get to sleep with his seven week girlfriend and he can't wait. The hilarity starts up when everyone's about to start getting it on and problems keep cropping up.To me, the two funniest parts is the scene at the restaurant with Jamie speaking Chinese and the scene under the table with the dog. You are not getting Disney here so be warned - but you are getting under an hour and a half of fun. This is cute and extremely light. No thinking required."
3,it's funny enough,"the acting in this one goes over the top, but i was just looking to laugh...what guys will go through to get their needs met. believe me, i can relate. the women are sexy and the condom buying scene itself is hysterical...don't be ashamed to rent it...."
2,I've seen funnier,"I bought this movie for a friend who just loved it. I on the other hand think it was mediocre. Other than a handful of funny ""one-liners"" this movie leaves little to be desired. High point of the movie, almost seeing Vivica A. Fox naked...almost."
5,Super double fantastic.,"If you like Sir Mix-A-Lot, Jeff Foxworthy and poop jokes - and I know you do - you'll love Booty Call. The scene where they talk about Euclidean geometry while ""knockin' boots"" (to borrow the colloquilism of the hood) is a stand out. Huzzahs to the creative geniuses behind ""Booty Call"" - the reason movies were invented!"
4,Good before the service manual,"Good book. Althought not in-depth info, it's a very good basic book to help understand the various systems (fuel, cooling, ignition, etc) before going to the motor service manual in a atempt to fix some problem with the engine. This book is much better suited to the person who wants to keep an outboard motor in good shape, rather fix or rebuild a broken motor. It also has a very good chapter on winterizing."
5,Would not be without one.,"Our last Bunn lasted over 10 years. Although it still was working, it had a small leak so we decided to replace it with this one. Love it!"
2,Bunn home coffee brewer,"On Sept. 22, less than a month after I had the coffee maker, the lip of the carafe broke into a coffee mug. It could have been very dangerous for one of my students if a paraprofessional hadn't noticed the carafe as he put it back."
1,If you like a BASE model...,"We've always used Mr Coffee coffeemakers. A friend raved about this Bunn model...really fast coffee with great taste... so much so she sent one to us as a birthday gift. Well, its great if you dont care about auto shut-off (I DO!) and if you dont care about spilling the coffee when you sneak a cup before the entire brew cycle is finished, the good ol' pause and serve feature (I DO..) and if you could care less about programming your next pot (I DO). Granted, it does brew quickly. But it just doesnt have the features that I want and use, therefore it rates a 1 out of 5."
2,Doesn't Hold Up,"I have used Bunn coffee makers since the 1980's and found that they only last about 2-3 years before something fails. The most frequent failure is plastic cracking and breaking off around the spray head. Other problems over the years have been failed warmer plates, tank heaters, and leaking tanks. We used filtered water and don't abuse the product.If you make more than a half pot and grind your own beans, the filter basket will overflow with water and make a mess. Even with commercially ground coffee, a full pot can float the grounds over the filter (I use tall Bunn filters) and into the pot and ultimately into your cup.The reason we keep buying Bunn coffee makers is for the convenience of always having hot water ready to brew a fast pot of coffee or tea."
5,60th Birthday Surprise Party Gift from Amazon,"The invitations came about two weeks before the scheduled surprise party. I was looking for something special for the gift. This was a beautiful gift package and delivery was super fast. I was afraid the basket would not arrive in time for the party, but there was plenty of time. It came within a few days and was a perfect gift. Thank you so much."
5,Excellent source on Vienna,"I've used this guide frequently on at least 9 or 10 trips to Vienna during there past 4 years. I think it's an excellent ""first level"" source on the main sights and features of Vienna and have re-read it many times to continually discover new tips and insights. It is also a good source for day trips out of Vienna and has an excellent selection of maps. The book is light and easy to carry around so lends itself to frequent use."
2,Not up to snuff,"I read some of the other reviews of this book that were not very positive and thought, ""how bad can it be, it's Lonely Planet?"" I've been traveling with Lonely Planet for over a decade now and have never been disappointed...until now. While I'm sure that for some of LP's audience knowing which nightclubs is the best may be essential information, that's not me. And the air of contempt with which the author talked about the sights I was interested in was a real turn off. The ""local perspective"" sections seemed negative and condescending. And, after a while, I got tired of the repeated references to dog poop. BTW I was in Vienna for 10 days and only saw one pile. This book seemed designed to discourage me from visiting. Fire this guy LP. Rick Steves did a much better job on this city."
4,Incredibly helpful,"The fancy of going to Vienna next summer crossed my mind more than once so I decided to pick this up just to get some more information on the City of Music. It's a very concise book that can be easily toted around in a bag or pocket, which I immediately liked because should I go I would want to keep it on hand. I liked the layout for places to stay, going from campgrounds to hostels, to the hotels, going from one star to five. It has a great listing for restaurants and has the city pretty much covered in respects to places to visit and a calendar of events, which makes planning a trip a lot easier. The history was a nice added bonus for someone not knowing about the city, as well as historical people that spent time/grew up in Vienna (ie: Mozart). Colour photos and things such as political mindset, attitude towards children, the legal system are nice touches as well. However, take the prices with a grain of salt, especially with the new introduction of the Euro."
1,One Star is Too Many,"As an elementary teacher who loves poetry, I am always looking for collections to share with my students. This book is awful. It's full of strange obscure poems about animals getting slaughtered. Here's one of Rosen's ""gems""Ravens gnawingmen's necksblood spurtingin the fierce frayhacked fleshbattle madnessblades in bodiesacts of warheroes felledhounds cut downhorses mangledtunics tornthe earth drinkingspilt blood.I almost think this book is a spoof or a joke, there are so many poems similar to this one in this collection.The previous reviewer is correct--one star is way too much for this piece of offensive, cruel, insensitive, horrible collection."
5,ROAD TO AVONLEA THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON,EXCELLENT MOVIE YOU CAN FEEL THAT YOU ARE THERE ENJOYING ALL THE MOVIE
5,Great set!!!,"Burberry touch smells wow!!!! It has rich, long lasting fragrance. The set looks good too. It is great for guys to give as gift!!!"
5,Very Good :),I saw a 3.3 ounces bottle in a store for $75. Went on Amazon & saw this gift set for even cheaper. I got exactly what I wanted. All bottles were at least 3.3 ounces. Box it came in was in good shape. Can't wait to give it to my boyfriend for Christmas this year & buy him something extra with the money I saved. AWESOME DEAL :)
4,=),Good deal!! However; the original box for product was a bit damaged. This was a gift and was a little hesitant on leaving it in the box. Shipping for product was outstanding. Product was received before original ETA provided.
2,"Talks a lot, but doesn't have enough to say.","I can't really say I cared for Shutterbox. I guess I was expecting more. The story, while intriguing, really goes no where. Everything could have been compressed into a few pages, rather then a few chapters. I was drawn in by the cover, and I though it might be a good horror-romance comic. The art is very nice and easy to follow, and some of the images in the book appealed to me. So I bought it. (I don't read manga very long at the store, since I want to get the full experiance at home and not ruin the story.)However, it was confusing, unfinished, and unpolished. A bit more tweeking and touching up, and it could have been something great. However, I just can't get into it."
2,I wanted to like it but...,"I just couldn't get into this. I was excited to read this example of OEL (Original English Language) manga, but I didn't feel any sense of danger or mystery to pull me in, and it was text-heavy and slow-paced. I will not be reading any other volumes in this series."
5,E-commerce programming fully explained.,"This is another excellent example of a Deitel & Deitel book. Following their easy to understand books on Visual Basic and C++, this book provides comprehensive coverage on creating a e-business or e-commerce web site. It is written in a clear and easily understood manner and filled with easy to understand examples. The provides a good understanding of the Internet and e-commerce business models and issues before moving into the technical aspect of creating a site. It provides excellent coverage of HTML, JavaScript/JScript, Dynamic HTML and cascading style sheets, Active Server Pages, and XML. This is an excellent resource for both the practioner and as a textbook in a beginning or advanced web development course. An excellent book!"
2,disappointing,"A collection of tons of information! Too bad it is put together in such a poor organizational fashion. Difficult to follow from start to finish.Also, I'm not sure what the deal is with ""Shiny"" pages, but this text is printed on pages that are so shiny that reading it was a challenge. I had to hold it at just the right angle to prevent intrusive glare.I will be a while before I purchase a book of this type online without checking it out in a book store before hand."
1,skips needed information,"The book wastes your time talking about what is on the Internet (and what the Internet is - hello, the year is 2005!) instead of teaching you how to program for it. It is not a programming book but an extensive advertisement for off-the-shelf programs and various websites. The CD does not contain the information indicated in the book, nor does the website. I attempted to contact them about this, but received no answer. I have enjoyed other Dietel books, but this one really falls short of their standard. You better know VBscript or JavaScript before attempting to use this text."
1,Outdated,The CDs that come with this book don't work with Windows XP or other modern operating systems. The content is outdated and the book should be removed from the shelves!
4,A good web programming startup text,"I am starting some web programming after about 5 years of system level software development. I find the text, especially the programming related chapters to be comprehensive and well explained for beginners. Obviously, individuals taking up web development professionally will have to refer to more literature concerning their tools and technologies but this is a good startup text. Some rearrangement of sections may be helpful to the readers, for instance, in JavaScript chapters the concept of variables is explained early but a discussion on data types is delayed considerably forcing the readers to make assumptions."
3,Lots of Links But Little Substance,"I was disappointed by this book, which I received as a gift from my daughter-in-law. Sure, there are lots of web links, but there's not a lot of substance for me. I suppose that for someone who is just starting to search for genealogy information on the Internet it's a good starting point. But I'd send them to Cyndi's List and that's free."
2,NOT EXACT FIT,"This fan is not an exact fit to my 2003 4runner just like the first reviewer said. Very tight fit but finally able to install it after a lot of wiggling and tapping. After I finally got it in, the electrical connection won't snap in. i was almost at my wits end. I had to remove the blower fan again to figure why the electrical connectors won't fit. Turns out the connectors of the blower fan wasn't properly aligned. I have to get a flat head screw driver and push the connector where it will align with the socket.In the end I spent 2 hours to get this darn thing installed. Should be only 30 minutes if everything was up to specs with the OEM part. The only reason i gave it two stars is because it is now running and compared to the OEM part which costs $200 at the dealership, i still saved money. Only time will tell if it would last."
1,Did not fit,"Did not fit a 2003 4 Runner. I ended up retrofitting the motor to the old housing, which required a lot of modification."
2,Hokey,"I found this movie to be hokey as hell, and the acting was second rate. But as escapist fare, it was also great fun."
2,Not so good,"This runoff of the original 10.5 is even worse. Not only was i educated by a wonderful professor at University of Richmond about geology, but also everyone should know this will not happen.It is a fact that at somepoint in time there was a huge divide in the two coasts, but nothing like this can ever happen.With that out of the way, i believe the acting was barely ok. I only saw it once, and never want to see it again, which is rare for me. Some of the concepts come straight out of 10.5. Meaning some ridiculous action would have had to be taken to avert this disaster. They actually get one thing right, politics. Without giving the ending up, it took along time for the plan to come to light and approved.Also, if i remember correctly, at the end they show the united states, the only problem.... California is still attached which was seperated in the original 10.5."
3,10.5? More like Hell in one shot!,This was a Good B movie w/some B+ actors. Honestly if UR N2 Disaster Movies than this is for U Sci-FI it's 4u So many thing break out @ once it's just crazy! It's N two parts. My Mom loved it! LOL
2,Amazon U.K. Sucks,"Under no circumstances ever use Amazon U.K. they are not the same company as Amazon U.S. Amazon U.K. customer service is terrible, they double shipped an item to me and gave me the run around tyring to return it. Their customer service can barely understand English and they never followed through on any request I forwarded, or answered any complaints. Amazon U.K. simply does not care if your unhappy with a product, received two or three in the same order etc. Tough, they don't care"
1,Great movie but negative,"I saw it on TV and LOVE that movie. I was so thrilled to get DVD to watch it again BUT the negative thing is there is NO CLOSED CAPTIONED or SUBTITLE for Deaf, Hearing Impaire and Hard of Hearing people. Its too sad. It isnt worth it to buy it."
2,I have headaches half-way through the first eposide,"Even though the storyline, casting, acting, and special effects are okay, the ways the cameras are moving and zooming in and out, much like amateurs taking home videos without good image stabilization, give me headaches. The cameras zoom in and out a lot even within a split second. I don't understand what effects the director wants to create besides giving people headaches.Also, for quite a lot of shots, there is significant and intolerable snowy noise."
3,If you've seen one you've seem them all.,"If you've seen one made-for-TV geological disaster movie, you've seem them all. This is just like all the others, and I like it because I enjoy disaster films. Expect cheap computer graphics and a predictable plot, but it's fun to watch."
1,Very unhappy,"Ordered product on Feb. 27, 2011, and still have not received it... today is April 5, 2011. I will never use Amazon again"
1,"so glad, I paid so little, for blueray disc...",Dreadful storyline and acting and editing...Dreadful...might become classic drinking game for all the cliches and zoom closeups...males are hunky and stubble faced...females are fresh and dust free...LOL
4,Movie Lady,"This was a good movie for a 3 day mini series, in all aspects it was a good movie and i would suggest buying the movie for a late night movie. but you will need all 3 versions"
3,If you see someone with this bumper sticker...run!,"There are all kinds of bumper stickers. Insulting, funny, touching, advocating a cause. This one seems to be plain threatening. Somehow I imagine the person with this bumper sticker has already harmed someone somewhere, and has been in prison or jail at least once. If I actually see this bumper sticker on a vehicle, I'm turning the other direction immediately."
2,Where's the rest?!!,I loved this program when it ran on PBS in the 1980s. This DVD is incomplete. It is missing about a half an hour of the original material that was shown at that time. I would love to have a DVD of the COMPLETE version of this program but I am very disappointed in this shortened version.
3,BBC'd into submission,"As a child, I really loved the book on which ""Ballet Shoes"" was based; the story of three orphan girls who grew up to be dance & theatre stars thrilled me. But this BBC version of the story put me to sleep: the charmingly eccentric members of the Fossils' household are overplayed and campy, and the whole thing is rather claustrophic: with very little in the way of actual dancing (perhaps they were on a limited budget), virtually the whole thing takes place in various drawing rooms at a glacial pace, losing the vigor, wit, and energy of the books - and limiting its appeal to children rather severely. My dance-obsessed daughter watched for a few minutes, puttered around with her toys, then wandered off.However, if you were a fan of the books, you will probably still want to give it a look."
2,Hmmmm,No embossing on back panel. What year is the watch? Rolex Usually has a brand emboss on the rear. I don't see one in these pics.
1,Warning || Fake,"This watch is not a Rolex it's probabily a fakey. Do not buy this item. Well, buy it if you want to go around showing off a fake Rolex... haha"
1,Highroads media thinks they have more to offer then the original author,"This is a truly outstanding book. However, if you wish to read ANY of Napolean Hill's work stay away from anything published by Highroads Media. What they did in both Law of Success and Think and Grow Rich is change the text to the way they think it should read. The changes made to both books are obvious and definately change the meaning of the books. Stay away from any work published by these people and opt to find editions that are true to the original text."
5,something every person in life should read,"napolean hill takes all the guess work out of what it takes to be successful... must own, i have 5 copies for friends and damily i can lend too"
3,Next time leave the original version as is.,"If it is not broke, it does not need to be fixed. Why do we have to stick our two cents in on a masterpiece. I understand what the author was trying to do, but leave greatness alone."
5,An in form Hoyt,"Despite the so-called co-authorship, the plot and James Burlane is pure Hoyt. The Congressman obviously provided ""insider"" info on Congress and the White House.Some of the points of the previous reviewers are valid (Confusion on dates, and anti right wing bias). BUT I do not think date discrepancies reduce the readability of this James Burlane Novel.Also if you are a conspiracy theory advocate of 9/11, READ this Book."
1,Don't waste your time...,"I read this book primarily because I like the Clancy-type of political intrigue storylines, but this book is ridiculous. First of all, the multiple storylines are introduced haphazardly, and are so jumbled and lacking development that it is hard to follow the plot. Dozens of characters are introduced randomly and many are not even necessary to the plot. The authors' bias is blatant: all liberal progressives are noble and principled, while Republicans, talk radio, and conservatives are seen as inherently evil and self-serving. If you enjoy balanced political intrigue, do yourself and don't bother with this book."
2,The switch of dates between 2004 and 2000 are confusing.,"Chapter 1 starts off with the date January 18, 2004. Subsequent to that on page 83 it talks of Gore ""running in place....and talking of returning to the Senate,"" but on page 84 it speaks of Gore's defeat in 2000. On page 140 it speaks of the story's crime committed in the U.S House chamber on January 18, 2004 as happening, ""just days into the year 2000."" At the opening of Part 3 Chapter 14, page 198, a ""Transcript of a taped call received at 10:20 a.m., 22 January 2000, by hot-line operator Roberta Jaimeson.,"" is given. The story line was interesting and plausible, but all of these discrepancies in dates made for difficult reading. This reader wondered whether he had missed some statement of retrospective presentation, or whether there was a major and unforgiveable oversight on the part of the authors and proofreaders. Alfred McWilliams (almc@gsu.edu) Atlanta, Georgia"
2,It goes without saying!,"Prior to reading the ""about the authors"" at the end of the book it was apparent the writers had disdain for all things conservative and or republican. Shots were taken at ""talk radio"", Ollie North, the 2nd amendment, etc. It should have been no surprise to learn that Neil Abercrombie was an elected democratic Congressman and Senator, obviously embittered at losing the House and Senate to the Republicans.Don't waste your time reading this farce of a book! It's partisan politics at its worst!"
3,Can't decide one way or the other.,"For the first half hour of L'Enfer, and with an urgent pace, Chabrol shows every reason and indication that Nelly is cheating on Paul. But after that, it becomes frusterating and hard to know for sure.Ultimately, Paul was dillusional. But the first 30 minutes still makes me wonder. I guess it's up to you to decide how faithful Nelly is and what really happens at the end."
1,Destined for the inferno,"Life is too short to watch this kind of movie. The depiction of mental illness is worthy of some of Hollywood's more disrespectful efforts. The entire scenario is ludicrous and uninvolving, the tone stupidly histrionic. Emmanuel Beart tries to make sense of her role, it is true, but even she eventually despairs and abandons her performance to the whims of the director. Having seen this at the theatre, I can only say that it is extremely fortunate that the DVD transfer is very poor - the less you see and hear of Mr.Chabrol's folly the better."
3,Emmanuelle' Beart:,"hey I agree with most here: however, with one exception. Emmanuelle' Beart, is one of the most extrodinere' performers to come around in a long time. Shes not only beautiful, but talented. She took this ho hum movie, and made it so realistic. Lighten up, critics.. its only a movie."
1,Film is fine; dvd transfer horrid.,I bought and had to return this DVD twice because it is a badly flawed transfer. Considerably worse than the VHS. Only filler was a trailer which was unwatchable because the video and audio broke up.
3,burnt-in subtitles,"Be aware that unfortunately, this DVD has non-removable subtitles!Apart from this, in my view, one of Chabrol's finest efforts starring Francois Cluzet and Emmanuelle Béart giving a superb performance only equalled by her other work with Claude Sautet."
5,Breathtakingly Brilliant,"The images and subject matter of this unusual, mesmerizing film, ""L'Enfer"" based on Henri-Georges Clouzot's final script and adapted and directed by French Hitchcock, Claude Chabrol are breathtakingly beautiful. After seeing his ""La Ceremonie"" I became a hardcore Chabrol fan embarassingly for the first time that I can remember. Clouzot is also a favorite of mine and usually posthumous marriages of this kind could fare better like Traufaut's script of ""The Little Thief."" The acting is superb. I do not know what the fuss is about the ""DVD transfer"" as I ordered a used copy that was perfect and everything is gloriously preserved to watch again and again, it is that brilliant."
1,nothing special,"This film disappoints. Although it is not so boring, or so slow, it is not anything special. You don't lose anything by not watching it."
4,The Origin of the Bible,This book was edited by Philip Comfort and he got contributing scholars who do not question the tradition view of the Bible as the Word of God spoken through Jesus as recorded by his Apostles. I am not saying I don't believe this but I think more recent scholarship has assigned a later date to the composition of the Gospels. But I am not a student of religious history so I am not sure what the majority of scholars believe.
1,More posturing than substance,"The first thing anyone who reads this book needs to realize is that all of its contributors are recognized in evangelical circles, but do not reflect more widespread scholarly opinion. Few academics today will tell you that the Bible is infallible, and even fewer will point to statements from the Bible as proof.Also, a lot of statements in the book were made without adequate factual backing. Most of the opinions expressed were supported only by rhetoric, making me even more wary of a book that is already questionable. Refutations of common beliefs in Biblical scholarship, including multiple authorship of the Old Testament, were dismissed with cursory arguments that lacked real depth.Overall, ""The Origin of the Bible"" failed to be convincing. This book was clearly designed for those who are already Christian fundamentalists, and not for someone searching for well-developed answers to tough biblical questions."
1,The Courage of Captain Plum,"James Oliver Curwood wrote many wonderful stories. This isn't one of them. In fact, it doesn't read like one of his books."
3,Writing,Nothing special - needed it for class.Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
4,The FBI Story,We both really enjoy catching up watching many old movies when time allows us to do so. This is another.
4,The Politically Correct FBI Story,"A great historical snapshot of the FBI up through the Cold War. Jimmy Stewart does his best with a script that seems to be sterilized by JE Hoover to give the public an entertaining film. As such it is somewhat flat and drawn out. For those who are Stewart fans or who want to see the earlier years of the FBI, it serves its purpose."
2,Pure Malarkey,"The USA got along fine for 150 years without a national police force before the Congress in its wisdom tapped a mentally unbalanced lawyer and career bureaucrat to run the Federal Bureau of Investigation. To his credit, J. Edgar Hoover did introduce modern scientific method to the practice of criminology, but activities of the FBI's field agents have been a fiasco from the word go. Unintentionally, from the producers standpoint, you get some sense of the FBI's relentless bungling in this film, a dramatized ""history"" of the agency, in which the Bureau is usually a day late and a dollar short, crossing wires with local law enforcement officers at every turn and making big noises about very small accomplishments. Murray Hamiltion delivers a monologue about the necessity of a police state that is truly despicable. It's a shame that James Stewart, a genuine patriot and conservative, lent his reputation to this tripe."
2,2nd Amendement Commentary?,"Trying to assess the message conveyed when agents were officially allowed to carry and then Sam gets whacked, hmmmm, such emphasis on the loss and made me think they might have made the wrong decision?? Am very pro-gun and was confused with this scene, so was off-kilter for the other high and mighty POVs of the B... All I am aware of through cinema is they screwed Joe Pistone bigtime and I will never get over the mix up with the CIA and 9/11. BUT loved Stewart and Miles, and the jungle scenes were absolutely breathtaking and unexpected! Knowing J Edgar has such a bad rap, it was fair to at least hear his side of the story and that he made certain, what a hero!! ;} Look forward to the Leonardo film."
5,Quality Hand Towel,These towels are thick. They absorbed water very well for me. After reading previous post - I filled my hand with some water and used the towel. It dried my hands just fine and there was still plenty of absorbency left in the towel. This line was recommended to me by my mother-in-law who has had hers for years. She is still happy with hers and they have good color staying power.
5,Excellent Revision,"Another excellent revision on a accounting textbook that continues to set academic and professional standards for the systematic leaning of accounting principles in a clear, concise and relevant manner.Thank you Mr. Skousen and Associates."
3,Well-intentioned but unfocused,"I paid hard money to fly this book from the USA and wish I had got it from the library. This topic does not lend itself to un-putdownability, but repeated attempts got me only to Chapter 3. I finished it in annoyance by speed-reading key paragraphs of each chapter and put it on the shelf.Good points: literate and covers a breadth of good ideas, plus some nice-sounding exercises and challenges. I like the intellectual values chapters.Bad points: No AHA! moments. No argument mapping. Diagrams that do not pull their weight and text that should be diagrammed. Woolly, wordy discussions of social conditioning and Milgram studies, that don't go near Cialdini's 'Influence' for impact. Exercises and quotes that speak of Noam Chomsky's idea of fairness.This book's intention is to open a new (presumed redneck) student's mind so wide that the wind blows through, dusting it with the enlightened prejudices of his college environment."
3,The Mystery of the Overzealous Ratings,"The Plutonium Blonde is a wry take on the hard-boiled dick novels and although it has a number of nice ideas and a few colorful characters worth following, the story itself is strung together by a series of silly (and wholly unlikely) moments of deduction and excessive fight scenes. Halfway through the story I began to skim the fight (and peril) scenes as they became rather redundant (and MUCH too frequent) and I literally skipped the entire confrontation scene at the end just to get to the conclusion.I didn't expect a literary masterpiece but hoped for something a little more than ""surface clever"" and predictable. It's still worth three stars based on some of the fun details of the world itself even if I wasn't particularly taken by the actual detective work."
4,Outstanding!,"Great read for Dallas Cowboy fans and football fans in general. The book reveals Landry's character and you realize why he acted the way he did . I have to admit I got a little teary eyed during several portions of the book. Tom Landry was indeed a shining example of a great role model we are lacking in today's world , not just the athletic world either. He was not selfish , nor greedy or craved the spotlight as Jerry Jones does to this day. I highly recommend it!"
4,"Useful for modern, self-centered women","It depends somewhat, for who this book is helpful. There are many strong, somewhat reckless momen out there today, who think they can 'have it all'. These sex-in-the-city like women often blame men for their failures. For those women the rules are helpful to see the relationships more in balance. But they probably will hate the book the most too.To women with an already pleasing attitude, it might do more harm, because it doesn't help much to boost their self-esteem."
1,These authors are stuck in a 1940's time warp,"Maybe these rules were the way back in the day of Father Knows Best, but times have changed since then-- there's been this concept known as womens lib! Seriously, I opened the book and scanned down the shortened versions of the rules and just laughed out loud-- even showed the hubby, who decided he 'liked this book!' because everything in it is about giving him his way and bending to him and caving to him. I read the whole book, just because I spent the money-- but I could not relate or agree to hardly any of it. What about marriage being an equal partnership? And what about both of you being responsible for making the relationship work? This book tries to tell you it's okay to be the ultimate doormat. Hated this book!"
2,Too Many Inaccurate Rules,"There are many rules to follow in this book. Many of them were ridiculous however, a few were very true. Particularly the rule that says never criticize or say anything negative about his parents. He will always defend them.I only agreed with a select few rules in this book."
1,Minus 5 stars,"Incredible that a publisher would agree to print this junk. Only in America. I'm satisfied with being in good company with the rest of the reviews. No need to beat a dead horse. If you are even considering buying and following the Rules, there may be bigger problems than just marital. And the authors? They're sitting back counting their money, having a good chuckle."
1,DIVORCED women trying to make money off of you...,"I picked up this book for a friend of mine who is getting married. Luckily I sat down in the store's cafe to look it over before actually buying it. It's a silly and condesending book with rules like ""Let him win"" to have a successful marriage.I have been happily married for over 25 years, and while I can't say what would work for you - I can say what worked for me. It started with love, honesty, and compassion - and we just took it from there day to day.If someone like me - successful at marriage - can't say what would work for YOU, how can these DIVORCED women? Every couple is different and they are simply trying to scam you out of your money. Please, take my advice and do not buy this book. Spend your money on dinner with your spouse to TALK about what would make your marriage a success instead."
1,Horrible,"I just read the table of contents for this book and I thought I might puke! This should be called, ""How to be a slave to your husband""This book only makes women think that men are superior and we are to bow to them. Give me a break! I was pissed just reading the table of contents"
1,Good Grief,"If we follow the rules of marriage does that mean we will get divorced too??? The book itself is really short--not even 200 pages, so thankfully there are not a lot of rules that could lead to divorce. Most of the book is common sense and I can't imagine why a person would buy a book like this that tells them what to do and how to think when they can act and think for themselves. Good Grief!!!!"
1,WORST,THIS IS THE WORST BOOK A WOMAN COULD EVER BUY ON THE SUBJECT OF RELATIONSHIPS.THIS IS A BOOK FULL OF MULNIPULATION OF FIRST THE WOMAN THEN THE MAN.THIS BOOK IS VERY SIMILAR TO BLACK MAGIC AND CULT LIKE THINKING.IT BRAINWASHES YOU INTO THINKING YOU ARE EMPOWERED AND GETTING SOMEWHERE..WHEN IN ACTUALLY YOUR NOT EMPOWERED BECAUSE TRUE POWER COMES FROM BEING WHO YOU ARE!!!!! AND ATTRACTING THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE REAL YOU!!!!!IF YOU WANT TO BE SET FREE.BUY BARBARA DE ANGELIS.THE REAL RULES!THAT IS A MASTERPIECE.IT'S THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH.IN A PRECISE AND SIMPILIFIED WELL WRITTEN BOOK.
2,Meh,"I'm a TOTAL rules girl. I did the Rules and my life changed and I'm married to the most amazing, caring, handsome man in the world! I was always an attractive sweet girl yet I just didn't get how to date. Many guys were interested however they would lose interest quickly and I never really understood why. Anyways, the Rules for Marriage are very disappointing. There is nothing in this book that isn't common sense.In my honest opinion, as a total Rules girl, I would tell other readers not to waste money. In my mind it felt like a rushed book put out by the authors to make money.:("
3,generally speaking it's ok,"Pretty good, not nearly as good as For Women Only (that's a great read) - has some general rules on how not to be a nag, score keeper, raving lunatic and other ways of making the hubby wonder what the hell he got himself into. Basically it's treat him like a king - and he'll most likely reciprocate. Sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do but sometimes he'll do things he doesn't really want to do. I don't agree w/ the x rated videos but that's my conviction. However, he shouldn't need all that crap anyway - he should be excited to sleep with you (as it says in previous Rules books). So generally good advice, but some are off the mark - not all of these are going to work 100% in every marriage. So it's up to you to decide what works, what's way off, etc. I was way more excited to have the Rules books they published before (that was some great stuff and works in a marriage too shh ;))"
2,TIme-tested...for how long?,"About 15 years worth, maybe? That's about how long one of the authors, Ellen Fein, stayed married to her husband. Now ehe's divorcing him and yet she's co-author of this book. Hmmm...makes one wonder just how ""time-tested"" these secrets are...and by whom....and how well they work on certain marriages. Call me a cynic if you want but I do think a book lacks credibility if one of the authors is no longer in a long-term (and lasting) marriage herself. And yes, I read the books. And yes, I hated it - even BEFORE I heard of the divorce. Let's just say I'm not surprised. The rules? Hogwash!"
3,You should understand your man this well,"These girls understand men! It's not about right or wrong, it's about acceptance, love and understanding. Understanding your man and giving him what he needs will come back to you (times 10). It will increase your communication as well as your own satisfaction about your relationship. This is not a great book, but it will make you think. Also note that this book is a little harsh about what a woman should be willing to do or give up for her relationship. So I don't generally agree with it. But it's still worth a read and remembers that not every rule applies."
2,Not a self-esteem booster like The Rules I and II,"This book was not at all what I expected. I thought the Rules I and II (for dating) were pro-women and really gave women a confidence boost. This book should've been entitled How to Be a Doormat. Several parts of this book gave advice that really could be damaging to a woman's self esteem: always let him win an argument, go on vacation anywhere he wants to go, have sex even if you don't want to, don't bother him with your problems (call your girlfriends instead) just to cite a few examples. The addition to the book that says the one author is going through a divorce was appreciated. But the part about ""now she follows the Rules more than ever"" doesn't make sense."
4,Well built and good looking instrument!,"They take more finesse to play than I expected, but once you master the wrist movement, you can make a pretty nice sounding cricket sound."
2,Unfortunate Purchase,"Unfortunately, I had to return 2 of the CD players. The first one the radio did not play, and the second one the CD would not play, it took two returns to get one that works. I finally received a good one after Christmas."
4,Fun to play with before dinner,"I bought this for the kiddo and we've had him work on it between setting the table and actually eating. The back side of the placemat has the problems without the answers, so we give him a dry-erase marker and have him fill it in. It's working and he is able to get more problems correct each time. It's also fun for him to try and complete all the problems before dinner makes it to the table.I took off one star for durability. If bent, these mats will crease. I can't see it lasting years (or through a destructive child), but it's well worth the price for us!"
3,Food on the Go needs Updating,I was disappointed in this book. I was expecting to find more foods listed so that I could make comparisons. The book needs a new release to keep up with the growing trend of the restaurant business and their nutrition information.
4,Sunday School Specials is excellent.,"We have used this already, developed collection of Bible Lessons. What an absolute fun way to learn about God. The attention grabbers are superb. Many times we utilize the basics--bible study, life applications, commitment,etc. and gear the presentations to the different age levels. Our teacher volunteers state that they have as much fun as the children. We've used books #1 #2 and #4. We would like to have a copy of #3."
1,NOT 1:18 scale!,"There IS a 1:18 scale Ecto 1 available, but THIS IS NOT IT! It retails for about $40.00, so don't buy this expecting a larger 1:18 scale vehicle...you will be dissapointed. Darn shame these vendors can't get the details straight and do their homework. There ARE two versions of this vehicle available and to advertise this one as being the 1:18 scale version is misleading, if not downright false. You will not get the larger 1:18th scale version for this amount of money."
3,Perfect Match for the ARC Bomber/Fighter,"Bought this pack for my son to use with his new ARC fighter he got for Christmas. The ship does not come with figures or droids to use with it. He has really enjoyed it. The Pack was kind of rare. They didn't coordinate it with the release of the fighter, something I don't really understand."
3,Just okay...,I first heard of this product in one of Carmindy's makeup books from What Not to Wear. Of course I rushed out to get it and I have to say I was a little disappointed. I also have a Shu uemura and I think that it gives a way better curl. Seller was great I have no complaints there.
2,...a grain of salt,I purchased this book partly [because of what others ere saying.] The lyrics of the obscure selections from American popular music are of some value but the arrangements of the music and the tune transcriptions are terrible. This is not a book to buy if you are looking for music.
5,A VOLUME RICH WITH ILLUSTRATIONS,"According to Webster's, gnomes are ""dry, wizened little old men."" Not so! They are irresistible ruddy cheeked playful little individuals who have amazing adventures.To prove this see ""The Complete Gnomes."" Composed of the extraordinarily popular Gnomes and Secrets of the Gnomes, this enchanting volume is rich with Poortvliet's beautifully detailed illustrations and filled with gnome news - the gnome who knew Rembrandt relates some tasty tidbits.What a happy book!"
5,"IT'S NOT FUNNY, IT'S HILARIOUS AT TIMES","This has got to be the most shocking video ever! It has gory stuff but some of it's downright hilarious! Standouts are an elephant going on a rampage b.k.a Dumbo's Revenge, A spectator getting his pants ripped off by a bull, a lawnmower thief getting ""mowed down"" by a truck, a tower that ""gets down"" at a concert, a bust at a motel, and the finale, a dumb lady who learns a hard lesson too late as she's crossing a railroad track when the train comes in and mauls her! I agree with anyone who says that you have to have guts to watch this and again, IT'S NOT FUNNY.....IT'S HILARIOUS!!!!!"
1,rubbish,"I live in the uk,and have seen this sh*t,this is not a docu,or anything else but sick,sick,crap,it will never be avialable in the uk,anybody who watches this film and gets enjoyment from it is disturbed,and very disturbing,take my advice and dont watch this,we know people kill them selfs and get killed but we dont need to see a human being tortured and then set alight,it makes me sick thinking about it,the american censors should be ashammed of them selfs!!!!"
5,700 pages just melt away. . .,"Reading Untold Stories is like having an articulate and witty companion come for tea. It stands rereading, nay, it encourages it. My favourite parts are the little nuggets of goodness in the diaries. He talks about how and why, like many of us, he chooses some plates over others: bowls or forks are either friendly or unfriendly, or thick enough to handle the snub. The simple pleasures and obsurdities of human life with all its foibles are here in humourous relief. . . Enjoy"
5,"Super thin, ultra flexible, and very retro-reflective!",Anyone who thinks this material isn't reflective enough is doing it wrong.Hold a flashlight between your eyes and point it at the reflective side of the tape.It is a RETRO reflector (not a reflector). It only sends light back at the angle it was received (thus concentrating the reflected light in one direction...back to the source!)I will be installing pieces of this on both my wife and my own black motorcycle jackets.Great product...probably will buy more soon.Wish it was prime :-)
4,Good Product,"I feel that the review was a little poorly written, but the product itself arrived quickly, and seems of high quality. Im having some attached to my motorcycle jacket, and a friend swipped some and is have some attatched to a backpack he rides with. If i need more tape, i will definately order more of the same from this supplier."
2,Not very reflective,"i'vwe owned two backpacks with reflective fabric within the last year. recently i bought a new backpack that did not have any reflective fabric on it, so i bought this product to solve the problem. sewing it on was easy enough and it looked great. then i took it outside and placed my backpack about 10 feet in front of my car and shined the headlights on it. the fabric hardly reflected enough light for me to pay attention. this reflected SOME light back to me but it was not nearly as bright as the light reflective fabrics i've used in the past. if you want some black glittery fabric, then buy this product, but if you want to be seen, then just go for the white reflective fabrics."
5,Freakin A!!,"This is possibly the best collection of hardcore CD's that I own to date. Great music from what I think was the best time in rave culture. Late enough that it was really hard, but yet early enough before the music got so completely repetitive that it made me want to scratch the DJ's eyes out."
5,"My dream TV, but I can't find one...",This is the last and the best TV ever released by Toshiba. I learned from research that both the Toshiba 34HF84 and 34HFX84 reportably are the last HD CRT TVs ever made by Toshiba. Picture and color are excellent. Inputs work great. Very high quality. They will be collector's items. I highly recommend this TV to anyone.
1,This Toshiba TV is not reliable.,"I purchased this Toshiba HDTV and had it fail just after the 2 year warranty expired. Toshiba explained there was nothing they would do back up their product. No TV should fail after 2 years. I recommend selecting another brand, you can get the same performance and price, and end up with a more reliable product."
5,Detailed Information,"I very much enjoy having this book. I live near West Virginia and wanted to know more about the many glass factories that were located in the area. This book covers most of them in great detail, and provides examples of their glassware. It is a good, informative resource book, and beautiful to look at."
3,A Good Beginning,"This album features Bruce Johnston in his pre Beach Boys days. The Title Song ""Three Window Coupe"" was covered by Jan & Dean on their ""Dead Man's Curve / New Girl In School"" album. This is a good album for seeing what successful artists were like in their early days. I like it."
2,Indiana Jones meets The Mummy,"I almost decided to keep this one. I like Egyptian stuff. The acting is good, the sfx are passable, and the music is tasty. However, the whole film feels like it's been borrowed. The plot hobbles along on hokey devices just to keep the story going. Danny ""just happens"" to know which Frenchman has the map, ""just happens"" to know the card game will get down to just the two of them, and ""just happens"" to know the Frenchman will offer up the map when he runs out of money. This mini series is basically a string of coincidences. Too bad, really, it could have been good with better plotting. Jonathan Hyde makes such a great bad guy. Why he only ends up in second-rate films I can't understand. Oh yeah, and parents beware. Scenes of torture and demon possession are splattered throughout the film."
1,bad acting,the acting in this movie is sooo baaad that one really has a hard time trying to keep to the story. I had to quit watching after about 30 minutes. dont waste your money. Its not even campy.
1,True Hell,"Mini Series? The other versions of this aren't called a mini series. If it actually was a mini-series on some channel it's good that it ended after 170 minutes, because this is 170 minutes of pure misery!.I don't mind watching a B movie here or there, but WHO IN THE WORLD WANTS TO WATCH ALMOST 3 HOURS OF CRAP??!!! This movie would have been much easier to tolerate if it were 1 1/2 hours or less, like a typical B movie.I couldn't make it through this movie; I had to escape from hell. The plot is repetitive to much better movies, the acting is OK at best and once again, it's WAY TOO LONG!Don't trust this review? Look at how many reviews there are as compared to a well liked movie. Very few reviews means BAD."
2,"Indiana Jones's ""Kid Brother"" meets the evil Set","If your looking for a serious horror movie here, you are looking in the wrong place! There is nothing scary in this except how much they borrowed from other movie themes. Can't anyone think of something original?? This guy is a archaeologist...and wants to throw the other team off the track of the find...so he plants a artifact in loose sand, and expects the other team to fall for it....Idiot! They also find King Tut's tomb under like 5 inches of sand...WOW...that was hard! This movie is very well written...for a High School kid...actually, I take that back, as my daughter (16) and I were laughing through the whole thing. Very silly movie. If you take it seriously, as a horror movie, you will be dissapointed. If you are looking for a movie to tear apart (in Mystery Theater 3000 style) than your in store for a good one!"
5,Still better than Indy 4,"Decent re-imagining of the discovery of King Tut's tomb.+ Great effects for a TV movie/miniseries.+ Good casting+ Believable locales+ Good action+ Good enough story- Sometimes campy, clunky dialogue- No depth to the cliche evil council- Sometimes unbelievable character motivations, actions (female archaeologist screws over entire dig team of their shares/pay by persuading local military into taking over site. Soon after the same workers are totally cool with her)- Hallmark tried too hard to make Casper look like Indiana Jones, each piece of costume, from the hat to the man-purse. Classroom instruction. Whip.Still better than Indiana Jones and the Plastic Skulljob"
3,The Curse of King Tut's Tomb,"This was an ok movie, not up to the other kinds of action movies like Raiders or The Mummy. Easy to watch, just not as exciting."
3,Indiana Jones wanna be!,"Curse of Tut starts out rather follish gets better then kind is fades again. I must say that the special effects and scenery is excepitional and worth the three hours viewing. Malcomb McDowell & Jonathan Hyde give this movie a big boost. They play he parts to the fullest& meanest. Unfortunately thats were it stops. Casper wants so much too be Harrison Ford, but comes up on the short end. Really short! Everyone else cuold be replaced and never missed. But again,its worth it just for a visual experience and something to watch with older grand kids."
2,was not what I thought it was,I didn't care for it. I thought it was about King Tut's tomb but it was a Indianna Jones knock off. I didn't even watch all of it & the part I did watch had nothing to do with Tut or his tomb. Was very disappointed.
2,tv movie,"i hate tv movies, this one is no exception, casper only does starship trooper movies, otherwise he is a waste...."
3,"Not a bad time killer, but goes on WAY TO LONG","This was originally a Hallmark channel mini-series and it's not that bad,but it was broken up over two nights and played well in that format. If you watch it like that , with a break in between , you might be better off than watching it in one setting. Watching the whole three hours at one time really shows the hole in the plot and wares on the nerves. A special mention needs to be made about the fact that some of the F/X's are not kid friendly , even though this is a T.V. mini-series. Watch it first to see if you want children under 10 to see it."
3,Interesting!!!!,"Bought this when I purchased my new Blu Ray from Amazon. [...] it was Blu Ray. It plays great. The colors are fantastic. And, the movie itself turned out to be pretty interesting and entertaining!!!"
4,Bollywood Inspiration!,"Cheesy, B rated movie with the plot figured out withing the first few minutes. But come one, you've got to love the cheesiness! Great special effects! If you've ever seen a Bollywood film, you can see the inspiration. You still gotta love this movie though! Have some fun, buy it and watch it!"
1,The Curse of King Tut's Tomb,"This movie meets all the requirements of LOW BUDGET. It is somewhat entertaining but has gaps in the story line and problems with believing it. Special effects aren't bad. Most of the story is borrowed from other movies such as the Mummy as well as a small protion from Tombstone, and the Matrix. The actors did a great job considering the budget and the fact that it is far from scary or even cursed. It is difficult to believe that this is a Hallmark production; perhaps it was over edited."
4,Thanks,"It got here pretty quick.I ordered a movie and got a movie.They did a good job I guess.I ordered a movie and got a movie,what more can I say?"
4,"I now have the complete collection of Oh, God!~ movies.",I's nice to be able to shop for items without have to search thru several items to find the one thing you want. I have used this method for a couple of items in the past few months. I luckily found both items in new and like new condition.
3,Looking back,Isn't it interesting that the movies that you loved thirty years ago (if you were alive thirty years ago) don't hold their sparkle? My husband is into old movies that spoke to him then. He is routinely disappointed. It was a less complicated world then and the fast moving scripts with great cinematography and special effects are different from those of a generation ago. Going home again truly is hard.
4,"A wonderfully, uplifting, enjoyable film.",No one was better suited for the role of GOD in this film than George Burns. John Denver's movie debute proved exceptional. This film approached the seriousness of the state of our world with the light heartedness of director Carl Reiner and of cours of the author.
5,George Burns is God,"George Burns as God was a great casting move. It was great to finally find it on DVD. I remember when I saw it in the movie theater, no one said a word as we all left. John Denver was great in his roll of trying to get the world to listen to him about Gods message."
4,A great family movie,"This movie was hilarious. Who can forget the great lines, ""So help me me!"" I cant think of what to rate it between 3 and 5, so i'll rate it four."
4,Wonderful dynamic.,"George Burns and John Denver bounce off each other artfully in this film, creating a deeply interesting dynamic. Denver excells as the hapless work-a-day man suddenly visited by the Almighty. His performance is strong and crisp."
2,"Didn't watch it, Amazaon ate it","Couldn't watch it on my Kindle, had no access to WI-FI, and so, somehow, it disappeared from my Kindle...and I rate that a two star experience...one for learning curve, and one for 'they should know better'...Oh, God!"
3,An Amusing Family Comedy!,"An entertaining comedy that delivers some laughs but fails to make an impact. George Burns is perfect as 'God' or at least his interpretation of The Almighty. John Denver shows us he can act and is very likable as the supermarket manager who gets chosen as a 'Modern Moses'. Some very funny scenes, the scenes where Burns comes up with amusing answers to Denver's questions are the funniest and the best. But unfortunately the cast is filled with duds, only Denver and Burns are likable and Teri Garr is only sporadically amusing. Paul Sorvino shamelessly overacts and creates an unlikable bothersome character. There is no religious backbone to the film, it is none the less amusing but unfortunately nothing more. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 6!"
4,Pretty Good but intense intro movie of Dinosaurs,"...It is scary - Dink and friends are often being chased by T-Rex, who roars like a lion - and yet my son really wants/needs to watch it. The animation is done by the Hanna-Barbera studios of my childhood. The video contains 5 or so stories about Dink and his friends' adventures as little dinosaurs. The stories teach simple lessons about helping others and the dangers of practical jokes. Although, I basically think this video is fine, I would have preferred something less intense. That's not to say my son would prefer that though!"
4,Tenryu,"This is a good blade. Use it to cut aluminum extrusion, does a good job but you have to watch the cut part from falling back into the blade as the teeth are subject to break, as the hardened part seems brittle. The Milwaukee alumicut blade is better in my opinion because the whole blade is hard and not just the edge."
4,It's hit or miss...but overall pretty darn good,"Just like their previous album, Asleep in the Back, Cast of Thousands is an audio rollarcoaster. Some of the songs are simple catchy little tunes that you'll hum for days afterwards. While others are strange and experimental and will have you scratching your head for days afterwards.In the grand scheme of things, this album is just as you would expect from Elbow...they've kept the same formula. There are some very emotional moments...there are some very dull moments...and there are some un-categorizable moments in between.The song Buttons and Zips is an instant classic...it will get stuck in your head on the first spin. Fugitive Motel has all the emotion of Powder Blue and then some.All in all, another great piece of musical art...not likely to win over the masses in the USA...but hey, I think that's a good thing these days."
2,"Great band, bad album","I'm not sure how anyone who has listened to this band's debut, ""Asleep at the Back,"" could give ""Cast of Thousands"" five stars. Elbow have taken a decidely different direction with their second album, and that's all well and good. The music, however, is not.There is nothing on this record that even comes close to the musical, lyrical and ethereal qualities of songs like ""Newborn"" that made the first album so engaging.There are a few songs on Cast of Thousands (Ribcage, Not a Job) that merit repeated listens. The rest is simply boring.""Fugitive Motel"" might have great production, but what good is that if the song doesn't go anywhere?Experimenting is one thing. But making something out of that experiment is something entirely different. I think Elbow have really missed the mark this time."
4,the new elbow,"at first listen, i was disappointed with this release..it seems so subtle compared to Asleep in the Back ( which I think is amazing)..but after repeated listens, Cast of 1000's grew on me..it's still Elbow, a little less melancholy but just as strange and experimental..Guy Garvey's voice is great as usual..standout tracks: fugitive motel,fallen angels,grace under pressure"
3,Cast Of Thousands bittersweet Britpop,"The great thing about Elbow is how they mask the sense of urgency of the blues in a hybrid of 'Coldplay meets Radiohead' type Britpop. As Gomez did it a few years back the blues, 'Cast Of Thousands' takes those same gut wrenching core of emotions and combines it with an airy brand of experimental Britpop. The CD straddles between the stripped-down folk of Badly Drawn Boy and bare-my-soul ballads of Coldplay. Connecting it all are strands of acoustic/electric guitars, eg, Radiohead, and orchestral strings which thread these elements together. Emotional but not weepy, experimental but not too left field, with enough guitar bite to keep you satisfied. 'Cast Of Thousands' could be very well the sleeper of 2003."
5,Perfect for My Habitral Mini Cage!!!,"I don't see why anyone would have issues with a domed caged? This awesome free-wheel slips right through the dome holes of the Habitrail Ovo Mini and adjusts easily to hang comfortably for my 2 robo dwarfs (Lucky and Charm) to reach. This is more narrow and allows more room in the Habitrail Mini cage than the stock wheel, and it looks way cooler too! Right when I put it in the cage the hamsters jumped in the wheel one by on and off they ran - as speedy as always! It did shake a touch but they didn't seem to notice in the least bit. I find cleaning to be just as easy as the stock wheel and don't understand the complaints? Just remove it from the hanger, squirt on some soap, spray and rehang. Simple and takes 2 minutes! It's quicker than cleaning theHabitrail OVO Club Trainer, but I still spoil my Serian with one of those! Overall, entertaining for both hamster and you, affordable, pleasing to look at and easy to clean!"
3,Gets HOT fast!,"These mitts have magnets to keep them close, and this is a nice feature. They can be washed in the dishwasher, another nice feature, but.....You better have a place to put the hot item out of the oven really close! Just removing a dish from the oven and placing it on top of the stove gets hot enough that it gets hard to hold. I removed a pizza and barely got it to the cutting board and pie tin put back onto the top of my stove. The gloves do not protect very well from the heat."
2,Only good for quick use,"It's a good thing this ships with 2 mitts. I end having to go back forth between the two because they get hot way too fast. As long as you're using them to go quickly from the oven to a counter top nearby, they're almost OK. Otherwise, it would be better to use something else."
3,Didnt care for them,Ill stick with the old fashoned type.These are OK for a quick grab but transfer heat otherwise
5,Great book!,My four year old first had this book read to him last year in pre-school. He simply loved it. I love how it shows children to have self-confidence in who they are. So fun!
5,Delightful and Empowering!,"""Nonsense"" is a real find, a true gem! Ms. Phillips has written one of those rare children's books that will delight not only kids but parents, too, with its delightful illustrations, fun prose and an important lesson for children of all ages. Perfect for old and young to share again and again."
5,"Humorous, Whimsical and Empowering - a Winner !","I have read zillions of children's books as a parent and teacher.Nonsense is a winner! It delivers an empowering message with the right combination of humor and whimsy and should be part of every elementary school curriculum.A fantastic book to read to initiate discussion about individuality, differences in learning styles and approaches to life.Boosts self-confidence and self-esteem. Ms. Kahler-Phillips helps get an important message across in a simple but powerful way. Thanks!"
5,"The Laughter of God - changed my ""seeing""","Lanyon has a wonderful way of using every day life events to reveal what we the born-again Christian ""already"" have within us. He shows us in the simlpest terms with scripture as his foundation, the treasure hidden inside you. When I am in a problem, his gentle touch through words makes me see through the darkness to the light by encouraging me to know I have the ""single eye"" Jesus spoke about. Lanyon always points the reader to the Beloved Jesus. My view of Christianity has gone to a new level of awareness by this encounter. 30 titles are back in print right now. I want to start a Book Discussion Group in Baltimore."
4,Weird passages,"Fearful Passages is a book containing several scenarios to the RPG game- Call of Cthulhu. All of them are linked with a way of traveling. I think its a good scenario pack, although some of the adventures are hard to play. No, i dont mean they're difficult, i mean it is hard to think of some good reason for Investigators to travel to India, Syberia or Irak. In my opinion the best adventure in this pack is ""Fear of Flying"". It was the first scenario we ever played in Call of Cthulhu and from that time we play CoC regulary. All in all Fearful Passages is an amusing adventure pack and a good way to spend your money."
1,Only for the complete novice,"This is not a book which contains a handicapping system. What you get are excerpts from previous books by the authors, which have been cobbled together. It's my estimation that the authors weren't really out to improve anyone's handicapping abilities with this book but rather, out to make a little money off of previous successes.Don't waste your time or money with this book."
1,dissatified,"I was not happy with this product, it was too thin and long for a 3-5 year old child. It had no cushion what so ever, but the material and fabric were alright but it gave no cushion or thickness, and when you ordered it, it didn't show that either"
1,"Great look, poor quality...","Headphone looks great. Nice, comfy. DID it's job...for 3 months. Although my ear hoops were still attached, the audio jack all of a sudden stopped working. I can only hear on the right side. Like the others, I was careful with mine. So save yourself some money, and buy a Sony...they are more dependable."
1,Not sturdy at all,"These lasted exactly 45 days before the plastic split and the ear clip part fell off. When that happened, I took a close look at them and found that the palstic on both ear phones was split in several places. I too was extremely careful with them."
3,Tenderness,"Set in New York State, the story center's on juvenile murderer, Eric Poole, who at 18 is released from jail having served his sentence for the murder of a young girl. Russell Crowe plays the hard-bitten detective who put him away and who is sure that Poole is a potential serial killer who will re-offend. He makes it his mission to keep Poole under surveillance as he sets off on a seemingly innocent road trip up-state. But all is not as it seems as Poole soon finds himself on the run with a young girl who has become obsessed with him and may or may not have been witness to the first murder. All the professional elements are present: acting, directing, lighting, set design, and even a minimal amount of music. ""Tenderness"" its a really simple movie about very complex characters. Everyone has their motives, their back story and while the ride is not as fun or well done as it could, it closes pretty well. Recommended for those of you who enjoy slow suspense, character driven thrillers."
3,Disappointed,"This movie is disturbing and i cannot imagine why Russell Crowe wanted to do it. It just seems totally out of his usual range. I love Russell Crowe in anything because he is a very talented actor and I would not have purchased this movie had he not been in it. His acting is great as always, but the movie is just not what I expected and if Russell wasn't in it I would have given it one star. I can't even imagine why this was made into a movie. I am very disappointed in it."
3,"GREAT ACTING, BUT A DISAPPOINTMENT OVERALL","Russell Crowe is certainly one of the finest actors in the world today, and has been a favourite of mine since I ""discovered"" him early in 1996 before he was well-known in the USA. (I was fighting cancer and needed something to take my mind off it) And because of this admiration, I purchased ""Tenderness"" without ever having seen it. Directed by John Polson I was certain that this would be a great film.However, I was disappointed. The acting throughout was excellent and that is probably the only positive thing I can say about it. The film seems to be a collection of disjointed vignettes, without any kind of common theme or thread or story line. If you are a total Russell Crowe fan you will want this as part of your collection. If not, then you won't miss out by not seeing it."
1,Where's the movie??,"The description on the back cover of this Dvd sounds promising... And I expected a thriller up there with Silence of the Lambs, Along Came a Spider, Kiss the Girls... What I got was a whole lot of Boredom that went no where.... Campfire Ghost stories will give you a better thrill... That or the movies I mentioned above... Don't waste your money on this movie...."
4,First movie in my life I dont really know how to rate,"If your looking for some great murder detective mystery or major use of a big star, run now and never look back as this movie isn't that. It was so riveting, eerie, haunting, yet it made no sense to me, maybe some will call it silly and unrealistic and review it poorly. I cant answer that. I couldn't relate or understand the male or female motives but nonetheless even though I kept asking why, why are they doing this, I couldn't stop watching. I have no idea but I give it four stars for confusing a movie vet and making me wonder if this was some HBO 12 episode run if it could have been fleshed out into something astounding."
1,Worse than you can believe....,"I bought this movie because we read the novel ""Tenderness"" in my English class and I wanted to show it to my students... I read the other reviews and thought, ""It can't be that bad, how bad can it be?""... Well, IT IS THAT BAD! The students thought it was horrible and these are kids that would rather watch a movie than do ANYTHING. They laughed out loud at the ""sad"" scene when one of the main characters dies, it is just that horrible...It is a BAD movie..."
4,Ending totally redeems the rest,"I read this book a while back and admit I don't remember much about it. I don't even remember if I liked it. After sitting down with the movie and being semi-bored and semi-frustrated most of the time, everything comes together in the last few scenes and the last shot changed my mind about the whole thing entirely. If only the movie had given any hint that it intended to be smarter and deeper than it seemed! I hope a re-read of the book clears up the motivations of the characters, the chronically moist-faced killer and the girl who is damaged more than she seems. Four stars for the last few minutes - two stars for everything else."
4,HIDDEN IN THE LIBRARY,"I found it by chance at the back of a dusty shelf in my village library. Hadnt been read for a long time.It was surprisingly well written: a clear, uncomplicated and crisp style. It told the story in an economical way which but a little wooden. One reviewer compared it unfavourably to a John Grisham, but it was BETTER than that! This had a lot of interesting twists and turns which were too far fetched, but hey...it's only a story.I did enjoy the cod philosophy and it set me thinking about the issues.The characters were well rounded and beleivable.The ending came too suddenly and because of this it lost its effect.Overall...I would recomend the book."
5,A NEW STAR IN THE SKY OF THRILLERS,"It was about time! Writer Habemus...It has ALL: Professionalism as a writer;a great but humble exhibition of culture mixed well into the story;strong characters; the exact speed; Originality and a talentous, unexpected but logical end; not one single flaw in development, Good timing...NOt heavy or dull in the Court of Justice scenes; sensitive characters...Beautifully done. You can read it as you wish:As a thriller, a Legal, a suspense...You decide: But be careful with your timing, because you will not be able to put this book down until you read the last page. Send your wife and kids on a weekend trip. Unhook your phones Have something to eat You will not leave your place until the end of THE DEFENSE... I should know. I am a choosy Book Publisher Georgina Greco"
1,"Formulaic, ridiculously predictable ""conclusion.""","I ordered this book on the advice of the mystery book reviewer for Amazon.com. Not only does this tome sprawl needlessly over an extended timeframe, but the outcome is telegraphed well before the midpoint of the novel is reached. It was a major effort to summon the requisite strength to finish it! I couldn't recommend this book to anyone."
3,There's MUCH better legal thrillers out there,"This is supposed to be a ""deep"" legal thriller due to all sorts of philosophy within. Rather than truly engaging the ideas of Socrates and others, however, they are almost thrown in at random to provide the illusion of an intellectual depth which is really not there. Otherwise a pretty standard, and admittedly enjoyable legal thriller, but I was expecting a lot more. Finally, the rather important plot twist at the end was a little too predictable and utterly implausible. If you want to think while reading courtroom tales, stick with Scott Turow."
3,Okay To Read But Not To Buy!,"Buffa has written a fast-moving, fairly entertaining story that generally holds your interest. The ending, however, is very predictable and one that you are likely to guess about 2/3s of the way through the book. Also, Buffa needs to improve his pacing in terms of providing for the passage of time. In several instances he allows years to go by without sufficient set-up for the reader. My suggestion is that if you have an interest in reading The Defense, get it from the library or borrow it from a friend; do not pay $20 for it!"
4,"Good book, I'll read Buffa again.","The first half seemed a bit disjointed, as if the plot was taking too many ""detours"". But as I got further into the story it was much more captivating; and in fact, the relevance of some of the detours became evident. I agree that the identity of the killer was predictable, but that still did not take away from what I found to be a ""delightfully twisted"" surprise ending! I'm looking forward to reading Buffa's latest novel."
2,Not What I Expected.....,"This is Buffa's first work and his first book that I have read. (In fairness I will read ""Prosecution"" to see if I am judging him too hastily.) Instead of being about one case, it is about a series of seemingly unconnected felony trials handled by defense attorney Joe Antonelli. I have been a trial attorney practicing law in a metro area for over 25 years now and I find Antonelli to be, well, just not believeable. He certainly is unlike any attorney I have ever encountered. Too slick, too rich, too successful. The story line of the book was weak and easy to figure out. Don't waste your time on this guy. Stick with Grisham."
4,Great Read!,"Well written. Buffa appealed to my 'problem solving' side. I think we should be so lucky like the reader from Mt. View, CA, who had it all figured out! Pahleeze! He should read scientific research then! Cast of characters are very believable. Worth the time and energy to read. Looking forward to D.W.B.'s 'Prosecution'."
5,Bob Ross,"I would recommend this for the beginning to advanced artist. Bob is wonderful,an exceptional teacher. I would rate this as excellent!!"
5,great workshop,Makes painting like Bob Ross easy. Very easy to follow and paint with him. Great for beginner painters. I absolutely love these workshops.
5,JUST WHAT I NEEDED,This 3 hour instructional tape could not have been better....thank you for aiding me in benefiting by the instructions contained therein.
5,Great for the aspiring painter,"My teenaged niece decided to take up painting. So, I just had to get her a Bob Ross video....he really is the painting guru. And even if you never pick up a paintbrush, just listening to the man talk can make you feel good about yourself. I chose this DVD because of the variety of landscapes. Gotta love his happy trees."
5,Wonderful teacher,I purchased this for my 8yr old daughter for christmas. She wants to be an artist when she grows up & this has great teaching techniques for her to learn from.
1,Doesn't Play,Looks to be scratched and does not play on XBOX or computer. I'm sure the content is great but we can't see it.
4,"Not 'excellent', but still great...","So I got this CD today, and I am absolutely in love with it. Granted, there are a few songs I could do without (Listen to Your Heart, Why, All This Time). But there were so many other great songs (The Loves We Lost, Adagio for Strings, Sunset). In my opinion, the second CD is much better than the first. The first is more poppy, especially the first 3 tracks. The second disk is slightly darker. This CD is definately worth it, and is sure to please most trance addicts."
4,Stuck in my CD player,"This cd was worth my money, especially when it smoothed into Mynt's ""still not sorry"". The moment of grace was when I heard Tiesto's ""Adagio for Strings"" since I had been DYING to get the Parade of Athletes for this song alone. Anyway, if you like trance or even if you've barely dipped your feet into it I suggest you buy this cd cause even though you may not be like those trance addicts (ahem,me) that are willing to spend all their hard earned money on Trance cds, this Cd is definitely worth the pretty penny if you're tired of the crappy stuff that's getting way too much airplay lately."
5,"""Swing 2 Harmony""","There are many great trance classics on Ultra Trance:5. I bought this compilation for the song ""Swing 2 Harmony"" by Perasma feat. John Con vs. Nikola Gala. Even though I have ""Swing 2 Harmony"" in a 9 minute version from disc 2, song #11 from Ultra Trance:4, I loved it so much, that I bought it AGAIN on Ultra Trance:5...this version is close to 8 minutes. I also have ""Feel the Vibe"" by Axwell on Ultra Dance:7, but this version incl. here is NOT as good as the other. ""Shivers"", ""Until You Love Me"" & the song ""Center"" feat. Jon Secada is also a welcome surprise, since I hadn't heard anything from Jon Secada since thie early to mid 1990s. The song ""See You On the Other Side"" by Paul Van Dyk is good beat wise, but I'm not too crazy about the lyrics as it seems to remind me of death. A little depressing, I think. Otherwise, I feel that is a decent compilation...Ultra Trance:5. And it is recommended by me."
4,good for the whole family,"This movie has somthing for the whole family. comedy,greed,freindship,good guys & bad guys. The teen age kids may groan at first but they will soon be laughing and they will stay untill the movie's over."
5,What a great movie!,"The Cheyenne Social Club is one of the best western comedy movies ever made. The banter between the two principles, Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda, is priceless. I will be watching this movie over and over again for years to come."
2,Ordered wrong = Cheyenne Social Club,I thought I was order the Cheyenne Social Club dvd not a download so I never got to see it. My account was charged but I didn't have anything to watch it on.
2,"this is a 1 disc set, not 2!!","I purchased this item because I have always loved ""The Cheyenne Social Club"". I have not yet viewed ""Firecreek"". I did watch CSC the other night and I was a little disappointed with the video quality. The quality was only fair, and not near the quality of most DVDs that I buy. I believe one reason for this is despite what the description says, this is not a 2-disc set, these movies are on a single, 2-sided disc. I always avoid these because of all the problems with 2-sided discs. This is not the first time that Amazon has inaccurately described a listing, and they need to do better. Buyers beware... if you're expecting 2 discs with this set, you'll be disappointed. This review is for the quality of the video and Amazon's misleading description. Personally, I believe CSC is a 5-star movie."
3,UH-OH,"This bio is mostly interesting and included some things I didn't know before. However, I found a glaring mistake that makes me dubious about the rest of the book. The author says Earl Holliman played one of the sons in the movie Giant. This is not so. Earl Holliman played the eldest Benedict girl's husband. This irritates me no end and makes me wonder if the book is well-enough researched."
2,There's nothing like a DAME,"As another reviewer said, I have read most ot the biographies written about Elizabeth Taylor, and I am usually disappointed! They seem to never capture the woman; the authors tend to rehash old news clippings, or scandal sheet gossip.In doing this, the authors never do this woman justice. Not only is Elizabeth an icon of our time, but she has become one of countries greatest AIDS activists.This in itself took tremendous courage! There is more to this woman than celluloid, and ex-husbands. Face it, she's one great dame! I wish to some day read a biography of her that truly celebrates the woman that is Elizabeth Taylor!"
5,elizabeth transcends even biographies,"I was mesmerised by this book -- of course with all biographies, one takes it with a grain of salt, but I was most impressed with was how Taylor handled her career like a man -- how she was able to go on despite the pressures of her situation. the love story between burton and taylor shines through, and I think I understand a little more about love, even though theirs was a tumultuous one. she is a role model for people in the performing arts who turn their attention toward great and needdy causes, and I respect her immensely. long may she rule as the last star of hollyowood."
2,How To Destroy The Validity of One's Writing,"[seemingly w]ritten for obvious exploitive reasons, the author has done a greatdeal of research and twisted facts to fit the author's purposes. One of the hints is a quote attributed to Tallulah Bankhead about Tab Hunter's sexuality. The ""real"" quote has been printed ad nauseum and if [she] can't get THIS one right...."
4,What a Life . . .I Suppose,"It's not the author's fault, but unfortunately the subject of this book is extremely boring. Two words describe Elizabeth Taylor's life, at least prior to her involvement with AIDS funding and research: WRETCHED EXCESS. This is not a fun read, not because the author didn't try, but because he wrote about a person that just wasn't very interesting."
1,not for me,"this book was not made for some one who does not know anything about music, I found scott houston books easier to understand."
4,i am pleased,"I did get the book, i bought it used so it did look a bit beat up but it serves its purpose and i can read it. I was a bit disapointed because the price was the same as the new book."
2,Bad acting,"While watching this movie I got the odd sense of watching a porno not because of any sex scenes (there aren't any) but rather because the acting seems like porno quality. I'm not usually a big critic of acting in romantic comedies, but in this movie it just really bothered me. I couldn't get beyond that to the movie. Not that there was much else to the movie as it was a pretty banal plot."
5,Attention Kaniacs!,"I would never have known about this movie if it weren't for Christian Kane. Loved it! He finally gets to play a lead role, and does an outstanding job! Michael Weatherly's character is someone you just want to give a Gibbs' slap, as he plays his obnoxious part equally well, as does Estella Warren as Jeana... Great movie, all around!"
1,Another trite rom-com,"I came across this one on one of the movie channels...thank God I didn't get this as a pay per view. First off, Warren is not a competent enough actress to pull off any lead role. So, when a producer and/or director cast an 'actress' like that, you can usually expect a run of the mill script, chainsaw editing, highly unbelievable situations, and/or poorly developed characters. This movie manages all of that.Just another trite, overdone, weak attempt at romantic comedy. Perhaps the genre in itself is a dinosaur.You'd be better off spending your time watching paint dry."
3,Sad sex farce,"Girl is ""accidentally"" a virgin at age 25, has that fact inadvertently revealed to her whole city, is made to feel humiliated because of it, and subsequently finds the right guy to fornicate with. Sure, many movies glorify sin, but I've rarely seen one that mocks purity so blatantly.Proverbs 14:9 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous [there is] favor.Galatians 5:19-21 Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality...I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.Hebrews 13:4 Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.1 Corinthians 6:9-10 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral...nor adulterers...will inherit the kingdom of God."
3,I could watch Christian Kane kissing for hours,"I only bought this for Christian Kane. I'm slowly collecting all of his movies. This one is fairly predictable, standard chick flick sort of movie, with the standard cliches and a slightly playful ring to it.The virgin thing that is supposed to be the hook is at least not handled offensively, speaking as someone who didn't do the deed until 28 for various reasons that were not unlike the main character's reason. Though, to be fair, had I had an offer from Christian Kane, no reason in the world would have been good enough.It's a pleasant diversion, and like I said, the kissing thing is superb. I could watch that boy kiss for hours."
2,The Unicorn Hunt Young Reader Review,I thought it was a good book...it will prob. be better once I actually finish it...
2,Mundane Esoterica 2.0,"C# Precisely stands out like a shaft of gold surrounded by the darkness of all other books.If you like reading UPC labels, Indexes, Phone Books, or Citations/Bibliographies, this book is a must have."
3,Lonnie in a lesser Light,"Not to be confused with the vastly superior 1999 CD with exactly the same title. Both have this title track imbedded among their playlist, but the selection on the '99 set is superior in selection and sound quality than this 2004 outing. It does qualify as representative of Johnson's innovative playing in a range of styles, nevertheless. The guy is a fabulously expressive guitarist and singer, and it is no surprise that the great Robert Johnson, early on, tried to pass himself off as his sibling."
3,Gym Posters,These have good information and are easy to read. I ordered numerous posters for my gym. These were the only ones that arrived non laminated. They were packed folded in the box leaving permanant fold lines. I had to have them laminated. It helped but you can still see the creases. Posters are great but the seller is ruining them by how they ship.
3,Insightful propaganda,"I've read this book under the title ""Giai Phong: The Fall and Liberation of Saigon"". Straightaway the author has a propagandistic style, glossing over the way in which Saigon was ""liberated"" by the Communists. This book is a day by day account of the fall of Saigon, and the author includes interviews with key Communist leaders, such as Tran Van Tra. It is definitely an interesting read with some great photographs, but I believe that the author shows a definite bias toward the Communists, and his bias often gets in the way of honest reporting. It's a good book to read if you want the other side's perspective."
1,Weak to the Finish,"In the late 1970s, Hanna-Barbera made the big mistake of reviving Popeye, Olive Oyl and Bluto for Saturday morning TV consumption. Despite attempts to emulate the Fleischer style of the 1930s, these watered-down cartoons really miss the mark. The eight shorts on this DVD signify another low for the spinach-packing hero - an embarrassment similar to the mass-produced King Features cartoons from the 1960s. By no means confuse ""Popeye and Friends, Vol. 1"" with Warner Home Video's essential Fleischer Popeye collections. Thankfully, Warner pulled the plug on a second Hanna-Barbera volume."
1,Did nothing for me,I spent lot of money on this product and it did nothing for me. I followed all directions but it did nothing.
4,An Essential Mann Western,"James Stewart is angry, obsessed, and scary in this essential Anthony Mann western. The landscape is the most amazing and menacing element of a compelling story set in an ounfriendly environment with a spare but superb cast."
3,Ending was not exciting,This turned out to be a so so movie. The movie was average for a western. I did expect a better performance from Jimmy Stewart. Not exciting at all.
4,Great western,"Along with 'Winchester 73' are probably Mann's best westerns with James Stewart in the leading role. Great cast. Beautifully shot in technicolor, with gorgeous views of the Rockies. A good psychological study of characters. Stewart looks for a man who's got a reward on his head; he'll have to share it, though, with two other men who unexpectedly join in the search. And there's a woman in the story to stir up things a little. Not very ambitious -in my view- film, but well directed and to the point."
3,Another average Stewart.Mann western,"James Stewart sets out to capture and bring back alive an outlaw (played by Robert Ryan) so he can collect the reward money. Along the way Stewart gathers a diverse collection of people who all want their share of the reward.As with other Stewart/Mann westerns, The Naked Spur features some nice scenery - shot in color - but is let down by an average script.Robert Ryan spends most of the film with a silly grin on his face. It's meant to indicate smugness but its overuse is just a symptom of the shallowness of the script and direction.The other characters are merely a collection of Western stereotypes.Competently made but irritatingly conventional.The only really good Mann/Stewart western is The Man from Laramie."
4,The Naked Spur,If you are fan of James Stewart this is another one of his adventures and it has great scenery of the Rockies with a touch of the bad guy attacking him but all came out in the end
2,Melodramatic western,"This is a very predictable, corny, melodramatic western. The script is the worst part, filled with cliches. The acting is okay, although villains Robert Ryan and Ralph Meeker laugh and smirk all through the film. The highlight is the great western scenery. But Shane this isn't."
2,The Naked Spur,While the acting wasn't bad for it's day the movie it self less than steller..... you can spend your time and money on better.
5,More than meets the eye - and it's an eye-full.,"Beautiful cinematography and incredible locations frame what at first seem to be stereotypical characterizations. I chuckled through the first third of the film, was literally on the edge of my chair for the rest. The relatively light-hearted beginning sets the viewer up for a wrenching emotional fall. It is a haunting story about human nature that I am having a hard time shaking off. Stewart and Leigh are simply awesome."
3,Wait for the blu-ray,"It's clear that this was a magnificent Technicolor film, but the transfer is so sloppy and blurry that one can just imagine what might have been. Sooner or later there will be a blu-ray version, and when they do that they might well release a better dvd as well, since it would be so easy to improve on this one. I would put this on your list but wait for a better print. As I write in 2012, there are no announced plans for a blu ray version, but I'd be surprised if there isn't one in the next few years, given how much film buffs love this picture."
1,bad crafting on inflation accessories,"First, the pump, hoses and inflation nozzle are extremely cheap. The hose split at both ends and had to be taped. The inflation nozzle finally split completely (luckily I had the one from my old ball that was damaged while moving and made do), as well as the inflation nozzle does not seat well in the inflation port on the ball.Lastly and worst of all.. after using this ball about 10 times, the entire valve port came out of the ball. Unfixable.The ball was good while it lasted but the crafting on this one apparently sucked."
1,poorly crafted...,"First, the pump, hoses and inflation nozzle are extremely cheap. The hose split at both ends and had to be taped. The inflation nozzle finally split completely (luckily I had the one from my old ball that was damaged while moving and made do), as well as the inflation nozzle does not seat well in the inflation port on the ball.Lastly and worst of all.. after using this ball about 10 times, the entire valve port came out of the ball. Unfixable.The ball was good while it lasted but the crafting on this one apparently sucked."
3,"good ball, bad pump","The ball is nice. I've only been using it a couple days, as the pump that comes with it (which is one reason I bought this ball over others that didn't come with a pump) is a cheap little plastic thing that split once, and after I taped it, then broke apart completely. I had to rig up a bicycle pump. Long, tiring process. Buy this ball if you want, fine, but not because it come with a pump. That would be a disappointment."
2,Ping Pong Paddles,Seemed to be a good buy but after a week of play one of the paddles haddle has broken and the other on is about to break. Not very strong construction.
1,Stay with tried and true brands,"I purchased this item for my Lincoln MIG rig. Typical of this kind of item, it was shipped in the box that the Chinese manufacturer originally packed it in. UPS wasn't kind and the unit was shredded upon delivery to my home. The corners of the shelves were bent and dented. Given I didn't want the hassle of returning the item (and it's a welding cart afterall), I straightened the metal and put the cart together. The quality of the painted finish is poor (flaking off in certain areas) and it was clear the underlying sheet metal was rusted in certain areas prior to application of the finish. If I were to do this again, I would just spend the additional $30 and get the Lincoln cart versus the ""no-name"" Chinese manufactured cart."
3,"Not exactly ""heavy duty"". Wheels included are not sufficient.","Purchased awhile ago, just got around to putting together. Thought it was great that exact amount of nuts, washers, and bolts were included, no more, no less, but then one broke. Put caps on end of axles, (what caps) oops I guess they were so busy counting bolts and nuts they were overlooked upon packaging. Cart is NOT heavy duty, but light to medium at best, and like a prior reviewer stated, front wheels do not swivel very well. I'll have to buy some new, heavier duty front wheels so at least I can get the thing to move around my garage. Be helpful if shelves were marked 1, 2 and 3 etc., could prevent some head scratching. It should work out ok for me, we'll see. All parts fit as stated. Price is ok."
2,Don't expect much on sheet metal from China,"As other reviews have already stated, there was damage on the carton when it arrived and had missing hardware. Amazon was good and sent me a new one. When assembled and the Hobart welder placed on it, the swivel wheels would not swivel. The weight on the swivel caused them to lock up. I have already replaced the swivels with heavier ones. I should have purchased Hobard's cart."
3,Not too bad for the price.,"This product works as advertised, but it's a little on the flimsy side. Not too bad for the price but for occasional use only. I had to adapt it a little to my setup by drilling a few differnt holes, but it worked out okay."
4,SUPERB!!! Once you start reading this book - You can't stop.,"As an aerospace engineer and SR-71 fan it is my opinion that Brian Shul has once again given us a fine gift. It's like you are in the cockpit with the crew on each flight and at the same time you feel like part of the team that developed and kept this marvelous aircraft flying. I have to agree with one of the comments in the book...""They buried this aircraft while it was still alive."" I had the fortune to purchase my copy from Brian Shul at a recent airshow and will forever cherish my signed copy. Thank You Brian Shul and Walter Watson."
5,"The Untouchables, by Brian Schul","Literally could NOT put this book down and recommend it to anyone who has any feeling for the SR-71 Blackbird!What a man - to recover from a crash in Vietnam to be told he'd never fly again and make the SR-71 program is SOME achievement.He gives insights to the SR-71's performance that I never knew.I have since met Brian in Marysville, CA and talked with him ""forever"".A wonderful Ambassador for this country (and he's made my copy of his book a collector's piece by signing it!)"
5,A perennial classic,"This was a favorite of mine as a child, the illustrations with their yellow halos have always stayed with me. As an adult I went back to the library of my youth and asked for this book so I could re-read it in the teeny chairs of the children's section... the librarian found it after a short search, handed it to me and said, ""We will ALWAYS have this book."" What a treasure!"
5,Ask Mr. Bear,"""Ask Mr. Bear"" is a story that my brother read to me when I was 3 and 4 years old. He checked it out on his library card, and brought it home for me. I need this book in my Picture book collection to connect me with the child I was."
5,childhood memories,I finally found this book on Amazon after remembering it from my childhood. It is a classic and both my boys love having it read to them. It is a cute story of a little boy named Danny searching for a gift for his mother's birthday. He enlists the help of some friendly animals....
5,My cherubs love this book!,"Ask Mr. Bear is a wonderful little classic. I like to read it but more important, my 3 littlest cherubs love to have it read to them. It has a good storyline and the older artwork adds variety. They love the ending -- a big bear hug for mom! It is a favorite at our house with the under 7 year old group."
5,A Book for Our Time,"The little boy of this story doesn't know what to give his mother for her birthday and so he consults a number of animals (chicken, sheep, etc.). None of the suggestions suit him until Mr. Bear suggests a precious something no mommie can get enough of from her little boy or girl.This book was written in 1932 but its message is timeless. If you want a book that reinforces nonmaterial values, one that your child will love and that strengthens parent-child bonds, consider this one. Four generations in our family have met Mr. Bear and the fifth is just about ready to. Five stars, definitely five stars."
4,Ask Mr. Bear,"Danny's mother's birthday is approaching and he has no idea what to get her. He wants to give her something special, but just can't think of the right present. Not coming up with any ideas, he asks a hen. Not finding help there he goes to a cow. The cow tells him to ask the bear. It is here that the bear offers the gift Danny has been searching for.""Ask Mr. Bear"" has been a classic children's story for a long time, and will surely delight future generations of children. The only thing bothering me, now that I am an adult, and can look upon the story in a different light is - what would have happened if Danny had asked his father first?"
3,A bit of disappointment,"I pre-ordered this CD because I fell in love with KOL after seeing them on TV for about 1 minute. That was several years ago and I have been enjoying the first two albums and sharing them. Yesterday I listened to this new release and even though the music is great, the song writing is not as dynamic. It seems like the boys have mellowed out and slowed down their music. Maybe it is just a phase. I will not give up hope.--53 year old who loves music."
5,Best Kings of Leon album yet,"""Only By the Night"" may be the Kings' breakthrough album, but ""Because of the Times"" is undoubtedly their finest piece of work. From the heartbreaking beauty of 'The Runner' to the sexy, screaming 'Charmer,' every track is excellent."
1,"Wow, just wow","This is a completely unapolegetically terrible album.How people are even comparing this to KoL's previous albums is beyond me. I had to play this for friends just to show them how terrible it is. Everything from the uninspired music, lyrics, to the painfully annoying recurring scream in ""Charmer"" serve to make this one of the single most dissapointing, badly executed excuses for music I have ever heard.What were they thinking? It's sad to see the band is depending on their established following to blindly love any album they produce. I hope they can recover from this and I shudder at the thought of the music collection and taste of anyone who gave this album more than two stars."
1,Puerile Rubbish,"""Because of the Times"" is not the worst album I've ever heard - but it's close. It has decent drumming and occasionally interesting guitar phrases, but they're small punctuations between puerile, sometimes painfully banal lyrics that lack metre and use the most cringe-worthy rhymes. The 'singing' is harsh and tries to overcome lack of any real emotion with shrieks and howls. The occasional background vocals are off key and tuneless.Kings of Leon, on the strength of this album, need years and years more practice. If this album has any message, it's 'save your money - give this a wide berth'."
2,Experiments are for Labs,"Plainly stated: if you liked Youth and Young Manhood, you won't like this one. The first time I heard the aforementioned album, I fell in love, and I thought it one of the best records ever. The critics say this is KOL's best record yet, but in my humble opinion, compared to Y & YM, it blows. When I first heard them, I instantly thought: second coming of Bon Scott's AC/DC, but that idea is dead. Every AC/DC record, especially with Scott, rocked hard. 'Because of the Times' was some sort of test-tube contrivance which left me ill and irritated. I understand not wanting to be pigeonholed, and the desire to try new things, but just like Jim Carrey doing drama, I just don't like it. I say if you're the best at something, as KOL was at the type of rock on Y & YM, stick to it, damn it!"
1,Because of the Times,"Sorry, I didn't like the music. I thought I'd previewed all the song, but I guess I was wrong. I love their 4th album but didn't like any song on this one."
2,"Great songs, incredibly compressed recording","The LP version and most likely the CD version of the same album suffers from a fatal flaw, horrible compression, that makes you wonder why you even bothered to get a nice turntable and expensive cartridge. Someone needs to do something about this soon, as if will really give a terrible name to all other records that the band might produce."
4,Very good indeed !,"The Followill boys came up with a real good album this time, much better than its predecessor. Most tunes are great and stick to you after a couple of listenings. Great, lyrical lyrics, guitar chops, bass playing and drumming throughout."
3,"3-1/2 stars -- For those ""special"" times...","Straight from the this-music-ain't-for-everyone department comes Kings of Leon with their latest album Because of the Times. Although I've heard a lot about them over the years, this is the first time I really paid attention to them, and this album isn't half-bad.Well, actually, the first two songs are bizarre, but there are some good songs like ""Arizona"", ""Fans"" and ""Black Thumbnail"". Even ""Camaro"", a supposed romantic tune that is essentially just about a car, comes off better than most artists' dwelling on that subject. A more accessible track in that vein would be ""True Love Way"".There are a few other songs that I can do without too, namely ""Ragoo"" and ""My Party"". Basically, Kings of Leon are one of those you-either-get-it-or-you-don't bands, and Because of the Times further proves that. Fans seem to be split over whether the album is classic or crap, so listen to it yourself and then be the judge.Anthony Rupert"
3,A New Direction Yeilds Mixed Results,"My how such young men want to grow up so fast. Very admirable in this day of mostly terrible or second rate rock & roll but do you know how to pull it off? KOL try REAL hard and almost make a Sticky Fingers (Youth Young Manhood and Heartbreak being Beggars Banquet and Let It Bleed respectively) but it does fall short. ""Charmer"" would have been one of their rockin' best but Caleb inserts these terrible screeches that completely ruin the song, I don't know why the usually reliable Ethan Johns encouraged this idea but it was a bad one. ""True Love Way"" is not only boring but contains embarrassing lyrics. Caleb should know by now that you don't ever use the words ""and we would laugh, laugh till we cried"".I do like the rest of the material, even though it took me a week to ""get it"" but I hope the band does not go further down this more commerical road, for I fear that alot of fans would eventually be droping out. Myself included."
1,What the hell happened?,"After falling in love with their first two albums and praising them among all my friends and family and taking the time to learn their songs by ear on my guitar, I couldn't have been more excited to listen to buy their third album. However, once I did, I couldn't have been more disappointed. The great bands find a way to naturally evolve their sound and conquer new ground without losing their identity or their ""soul,"" so to speak. But where Kings of Leon went to and why is a mystery. Their grit, simplicity, and soul is gone. No more driving beats or bluesy riffs or plain old rock 'n roll passion. The music seems more processed and belaboured and washed out. There's nothing to tap my feet to, and certainly no great riffs that'll make me learn these tracks on my guitar. If this is the way Kings of Leon is headed, I certainly won't be following them. What a shame."
1,blows,"direction is all lost, hype went to their heads along with all the riches and fame... what else is new with bands that this happens to?"
3,Mixed,"A couple of disclaimers:1. I have not followed Kings of Leon but am familiar with their more popular stuff. I bought this as a starting point to explore the music.2. I'm over 50 (just barely).I enjoyed roughly half the music on this CD. The other half I found to be noisy, inaccessible, and at times annoying."
5,Can't stop listening,"Just an amazing CD as most reviews state. I think they are probably the best band we have in U.S. right now. After a few listens these songs will all stick in your head.What I love most is #1- how much they continue to grow and progess, and #2- they did the opposite of selling out on this CD.KOL has a big enough buzz that they easily could have made a pop rock CD that would have put them all over the radio and launched a huge stadium tour. They did not, they stuck to guns, who on earth starts what is supposed to be a breakout CD with a 7 minute song about having a baby? KOL does, because music and influences are obviously much more important than massive fame, which they will probably get anyway with this one.Give it a few listen, their sound takes some time, then you won't be able to get it out of your head you mofo's"
5,Kings of Leon--Because of the Times,"My new favorite CD!!!! it arrived in pristine condition and i've been listening to it ever since. If you like emotionally charged lyrics and mind-blowing drum riffs, this is your cd."
4,Excelente.,"No hay duda que sí hay música nueva de calidad y Kings of Leon lo demuestra, entre más lo escucho más me gusta, la voz del vocalista suena como si hiciera un gran esfuerzo por alcanzar las notas y eso lo hace sonar más real y te involucra. La canción ""Fans"" te vuelve un fan en 3 minutos. No he escuchado sus demás discos pero este es muy recomendable."
3,Lost Pixies Album?,"Is it me, or does this sound a LOT like the Pixies? The song structures, the vocal arrangements (especially on track 2) and instrumentation all resemble the Pixies to my ear.On its own, the album is just okay. Not dazzling, and pales in comparison to their first two. If you are not already a KoL fan, this will not make you one. Proceed with caution."
2,???Regression...sounds like they're going backward,"I felt a progression of solid music up until this album. I don't get it. Yes darker but boring. This sounds like it could have been any band in any bar on any given night. I don't hear maturity or complexity. I hear stripped down uninteresting background guitars over a unique voice. Feels more like filler, forced not inviting or heartfelt. I listened to the preview before I purchased. I think the short clips sounded great. But that's as good as ever gets. Some clips sounded like the were leading up to something. But they do not, that's it. Hey, I am disappointed. This album actually killed me wanting to go see them. Hey different strokes right.To me music is emotion. I felt nothing."
3,Ultimately Debunked,"A well-written novel that took you to the time period, but ultimately suffered from plot disintegration, like a failed seance. It just fizzles out into a bland love story with the obvious twise ending."
3,Desert Rogues,"She was all kinds of wrong for royalty!!When it came to kingdoms, impulsive, up-from-the-streets Cleo Wilson was no Cinderella. Why, mere months ago she'd done the unthinkable: fallen for arrogant, irresistible Prince Sadik -- and come up pregnant! Now, briefly back in Bahania, she had to bide her burgeoning curves or risk losing her baby-to-be to royalty!Tall, tempting Sadik promptly seduced Cleo anew...unveiled her secret...and demanded they wed! But could Cleo's lifelong fantasies of love and family find fulfillment in a palace? After all, wasn't she the last person on the planet to become a princess--and bring a proud, imperious prince to his senses, let along his knees?"
2,so cheap!!!,"This is not the same as when i grew up with, the plastic on this is so cheap it pissed me off to have purchased this for my 3 year old, the reels get stuck inside, they also dont turn i wish to return this product but dont have the time so its just sitting there, im so done with cheap toys!"
3,Grandma's toy corner,"I bought this product with extra reels for the grandkids to play with when they are here. There are one 5-yr. old, two 3-yr. olds and two 2 and under. They all seem to enjoy it when they are here. Also gave one to one of them for a birthday present."
3,it will work,It was very light and kind of awkward... we were expecting it to be more like the older 1960-70's ones...
4,Excellent. Childhood memories revisited.,Good quality. Images are as great as I remember! I would highly recommend this viewer or buy it again myself!
1,piece of cheap junk,should be in the dollar store. It is so light and only a thin piece of plastic over viewing area. Wish I could find an old black one like they used to make. Thanks China.
4,NOT like the Movie!,"If you think you know the story . . . you don't. There are several major plot changes in the film which alter the story completely. Be prepared to work with this book, it is written in the 19th century style which is heavy on setting up the stage. For many the reading style is way too sloooooow. On the other hand, you can't beat the story. I really like Gen. Wallace's book and its effect upon world literature (even if he's a Yankee)."
2,Movies Cut to the Chase,"What in the world possessed me to try to read this novel after I saw the movie? A big mistake. This is a well-plotted book, peopled with characters in conflict. But the Victorian writing, the long, meandering sentences, the for-no-purpose descriptions -- they made it impossible for me to do more than skim the book. I was in my teens at the time, so maybe I would be more patient as an adult reader . . . but with this book, I don't think so. See the movie."
2,Good story but way to wordy with extension descriptions,"See the movie. The book is very difficult reading, wordy with references not explained of religious history, ancient place names, and Roman and Jewish customs of the time. In all the rambling a beautiful story is told of Ben Hur, a Jewish prince, whose family is destroyed by the Romans and whose redemption is had at the hands of Christ. The movie cuts to the chase and therefore is much better. And rarely do I find a movie better than the book it was based on."
5,Wonderful!,"Though Ben Hur the movie is one of the greatest epics of all time, it doesn't hold a candle to the book. (The book plot and characters differ substantially from the movie, are much more interesting.) Ben Hur belongs on the short list of the greatest novels of all time, an incredibly good book you shouldn't miss!"
4,A Good Historical Drama,"Lew Wallace's Ben Hur is an exciting historical novel of the life of a Jewish Prince. Along the way he is wrongfully imprisoned, serves as a slave onboard a warship, becomes trained in warfare, regains his wealth, destroys his enemy in a famous charot race, witnesses the crucifixion, sees the healing of his family from leprosy, and discovers the Christian faith. By modern standards the book is overwritten, Ben Hur is perhaps to rigid and perfect a character (as are other characters), and the book loses some intensity after the Masala is defeated. Still, the flavor of the age comes through. This has been a best seller for 125 years with good reason. A very good read."
2,Not what I expected,This is a very basic book and does not go into any detail. Might be okay for a 7 or 8 year old that knows nothing about golf. There is a very short chapter that touches on the rules of golf and also one on etiquette but these barely scratch the surface. The book is not for a child that has already started playing golf.
1,"I should have known what I was getting into, but...","I abhor the death penalty, but I don't want to read about it as a plot device in a romance. I admit I was too influenced by the positive reviews, and didn't pay enough attention to the plot outline, but for me this book was both unpleasant and disappointing. Too dark and threatening to be enjoyable. Still, this may be a good writing team with a theme that I just didn't like."
2,How to Grow Non-native WEEDS,The title of the book is so great! Who wouldn't want to grow Wildly Successful Plants? However most of the plants listed in the book are non-native and the author does caution against planting the ones that are invasive. Sometimes a plant that is so successful that it grows everywhere and takes over is really a weed. This is a fine book as long as one takes precautions against letting the invasive plants take over.
5,I Love this book,"I keep this book close at hand. Being an amateur gardener, I found much of the information in this book to be particularly useful and relevant for living in Northern California. The author covers everything from the 6 different ""hardiness zones"" in Northern California to proper garden maintenance, and provides a huge colorful array of plants and flowers which will thrive in your garden.Divided into 7 sections, such as ""perennials"", each plant has impressive descriptions-- water needs, light needs, hardiness, bloom time, height and spread, etc. The photography of each plant is wonderful, and really allows you to see each plant, and how you might be able to incorporate it into your garden or landscaping."
1,Vastly irresponsible writing,"The book is more full of what not to plant then what to plant. If the recommendations for planting are followed the gardener will end up with aggressive weeds that are ""wildly successful."""
5,Very Helpful!,"This book was very helpful when I was preparing for my ASCPi certification. I passed my exams last October, 2008. I highly recommend this book."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"This was recommended by the NCA website for those wishing to take the Clinical Laboratory Specialist in Molecular Biology. This book as NO information about Molecular Biology in it. Total waste of money. NCA should not be recommending this book for this specific certification. The book is also just full of questions, like a practice test."
4,"Jacqueline Bisset, Truffault trisquit!","Easily one of the best, and true, ""movies about a movie"". And also probably one of Truffault's best (a lot of his moives, for those that haven't seen them, sort of go on a on and never really have a plot). But not this one. It's engaging and funny, and (having worked on a couple film sets) right on about the behind the scenes antics of a movie set.Also, this was my first encounter - I think - with Jacqueline Bisset. Man is she great. And what a looker. As I was watching the movie I kept thinking she looked like someone else and then I realized it: Elizabeth Hurely! I swear she could be Jacqueline's son. Anyway Bisset was lithe and elegant and spoke great french. Yummy yum yum YUM.So, if you like Truffault (and hot babes), check this one out.B"
3,smile! you're on candid camera!,"truffauts somewhat overrated movie about making a movie. why do people who make movies believe that making movies is an interesting enough topic to make movies about -- over & over & over? not saying its bad, just saying its nothing as special as those who appreciate ""cinema"" would have us believe. sorry."
3,why dubbed in english?,"gosh--i must say i really love truffaut, and i truly enjoyed this movie. i saw it once--a while ago--in french with subtitles, and when i saw this video edition i was truly disappointed. dubbing makes everything seem so silly; the movie lost a lot for me in the process. so while i'd give the movie itself a whopping four or five stars, the video only deserves a paltry two or three."
1,Will not play at all.,"Seeing there were only three reviews and all about not being able to play, I figured that possibly the issue would be fixed by now. I was wrong! It only goes as far as showing the BBC screen, then just goes to black."
1,Mongrel Blu Ray,"I am so Disappointed this doesn't play. Like others, it loads the BBC screen then defaults to the home screen of my Sony BDP-S570. I was unaware of coding and the regional issues when I purchased this."
1,Defective bluray disks.,"Like the other review mentioned, these disks don't work. It loads up to the BBC logo, then freezes. I thought it was a region code issue, but the disk is region free."
4,Entertaining,"A few pages into this and I thought I would drop it. But as I read more, I realized how smoothly and well-written it is. It is very funny, very realistic, and describes the trials of an adolescent on the verges of maturity. Catholic school students will love it."
1,No Connection,"This along with his other book ""Last Catholic In America"" were recommendned to me by someone who attended Catholic grade schools in Chicago about this same time. I grew up in Catholic grade school in the South Suburban area of Chicago about this same time and found some things I could relate to. But throughout the book I did expect some references to the title. Only one sentence in the entire book did he mention the nuns saying and kids questioning do patent leather shoes really reflect up?. Needless to say he never answered whether they do or not. He just went on and on about or even why the nuns thought they did. Luckily I bouth both of his books through Amazon's used book resellers connection and didn't have to pay full price for the book."
5,heart warming and histerical story of growing up in any era,"A wonderful story of growing up in a cathlic school in the early 60's, its a entertaining story that any will have u thinking back to high school days its a great story for any one start/in/out of high school..."
4,"Great book, needs a new update","As a pharmacy student, I found the Washington Manual to be the best pocket guide for looking up guidelines and treatment options, as well as interaction charts and pregnancy categories. This is a well written book that covers most of the major cronic health conditions and treatment. This book does not waste time and space talking about every detail of each disease state, but rather focuses on the causes, measurements and treatments. My only criticism is that this latest edition is dated 2004 and in medical therapeutics, is considered old."
2,The book is being overrated,"I personally feel that the the book is small, being rightly meant to be carried by residents in wards, but cramped with borrowed information which exceeds the capacity of the book. A lot of it feature in other standard texts and nothing is new.The algorithms too are borrowed. Information on antibiotic usage and common tropical disorders in detail are lacking. Unnecessary publicity is being given to the book and The Osler Medical Handbook by Cheng and Zaas is far superior to this in all aspects. Another important aspect is that students reading the book do not read standard texts and are clearly at a disadvantage while appearing in examinations.The book needs to be rewritten in another format to be successful.Professor K.N.Viswanathan , AVMC, Pondicherry, India"
1,Not please with this toilet seat,Ordered this as a replacement in the bath. Arrived with a chunk taken out of it the first time. Sent it back and reordered. The second one arrived with the same damage so I returned it and then ordered from a different maker.
5,Designer touch for the potty!,"After looking far and wide for a replacement for the shell seat I had purchased years ago and could only find white ones in the nearby stores, I was pleasantly surprised to find I could order this bone color from Amazon. Although the shell part of the seat is identical to my old one, the hinges on the new one are so much better. As other reviewers have noted, these hinges make removing the seat to clean more thoroughly a much easier job. The shell design dresses up the potty and gives it a prettier look.I purchased this in April, 2011 and have had no issues with it. Very happy with my purchase."
4,Fitting in,"I enjoyed the book, even though it was a novel. My background, born in Scandinavia and having grown up in Arabia is probably the reason for me choosing stories from that part of the world, as to me they are just more interesting. I can relate to being/feeling rootless and probably a longing for something that no longer is. The book, albeit being fiction, deals with aspects of how different we all are and how we long for what we had, even though its never the same and how second generations have adapted to their world. Very interesting read which I could relate to quite well. Highly recommended."
1,"really boring,frustating","the reason i bought this book was my prof reuest it and she said that this was such a good book she ever read. however ,after reading two third of the book the only thing i can say is that this book is really sucks. maybe since my native language is not english so i can't quite understand some of the sentence the author wrote. the story line was uninteresting to me and the main character was so depessing."
1,Painful read,"For me personally, this book is written so badly that I could not finish it. The author tries too hard to sound elegant and it fails miserably.I always try to finish books to give them a chance. This however I could not do with this paperback. Although it was the only book I made the mistake to take on a foreign vacation (could not buy other English reading material), I could not continue reading it. Too many metaphors that were useless and not only did not add, but took away from the story. You can not help but be so focused on the writting that you never get a chance to immerse yourself in the story."
2,not good,"I think that the author has to be more careful with the timeline of the story. When one sees some flaws in the story,he/she feels cheated.I don't think it's a good and well-written story."
3,Accent not pleasant,Bought a CD to listen to the story during a long trip. The reader's distinctly British dialect was not easy on my North American ears. My sister praised the book she read. Maybe that's the way for me to enjoy the Saffron Kitchen.
4,Bunn Coffee Maker,This is my fourth Bunn Coffee Maker I guess that says something about how much I love Bunn products. This would definitely be a 5 star review if not for the carafe. I think they need a better design as it's hard to pour without spilling. Highly reccommend this coffee maker as you won't get a better or faster cup of coffee.
5,Bun coffee pot,I bought this to use at work. It works and brews coffee quickly and the coffee tastes much better than with other coffee pots
4,Great Coffee Maker,"This is my second Bunn Coffee maker. The first one lasted almost 8 years after making at least 3 pots of coffee a day. (NOTE: If you are an occasional user (once a week) this coffee maker is not for you. The heating element continues to heat the water in the tank on an on going basis so that a full pot of coffee is brewed within 3 minutes. As such, water evaporation is unavoidable and lack of water would damage the heating element. There is a vacation switch that shuts down the heating element when leaving for 3 or more days.)My only gripe is that the coffee maker had a small broken piece of plastic at the base of the unit which did not have an impact on the coffee maker's performance. So I kept it. Apparently, it was broken off at the Bunn's factory by a person packing it into the box."
5,Love it!,I have been buying only Bunn coffee makers for the past 20+ years. My cousin told me about them over 20 years ago and I was immediately sold. They last almost forever. I just bought my new one in black because I recently redid my kitchen with new cabinets and stainless steel appliances and wanted my coffee maker to match. My old one is white and I am going to bring that one to my office so we can make coffee fast there. I recommend any of the Bunn products!!
4,Still getting used to it,"I chose the bunn as I like the idea of having coffee in 3 minutes, but I am still getting used to having to make coffee more often. I used this to replace a 40 cup urn and I would only have to make a pot every 2-3 days. The taste is also a little different from perked but getting used to that as well. All in all I am glad I did get it as I can have my coffee quickly."
1,Coffee Maker,"We've always sworn by Bunn Coffeemakers, this is our first bad one. The coffee basket overfills and spills coffee grounds and water all over our counter. We've tried changing filter brands and that didn't help. The coffee we wind up with is weak and has grounds in it. It's being returned."
5,BUNN 10-Cup Coffee Brewer,"I haven't bought a coffee maker in a very long time. Why? Well the one I bought a long time ago (1984 I think) was a BUNN so I haven't had to! If you want great coffee, and want a coffee maker that will stand the test of time get a BUNN."
5,Can't go wrong with this one!,"This is, hands down, the best coffee maker out there. I have had two and they have both been great. My first one lasted about 10 years and I am currently on the third year with my second. They are pricey but the quality of them will save you money in the long run! I will never buy another brand of coffee maker."
2,Love it but it leaks,"I have really enjoyed my BUNN coffee maker. However, it has started leaking all over my counter. It happens after it begins to brew. I am very disappointed in this. It gets water all over the counter and the floor. Not sure why it is doing this. I put less than a pot of water in it and it happens after it starts brewing. I will have to get another coffee pot and while I loved this one until this happened; I am rethinking whether to drop the money for a new BUNN (in fear this will happen again) or just get another cheaper one and use the timer."
2,Great at first - Leaks after a while,"For about the first year that I owned this machine - it was the best coffee maker that I had ever owned. However, after about a year it started to leak on the counter every time I used it. The problem has gotten progressively worse. I did some reading and saw several accounts of the seals deteriorating after some use. Repairing the unit does not make economic sense (more expensive than a new unit)... it is headed to recycle and I am looking for my next coffee maker."
2,"BUNN GRXB Original 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, Black","I ordered this coffee maker and it was delivered promptly. When I first made coffee, following the directions supplied, the coffee was so weak it actually made me nauseous. I decided to double the amount and the results were not much improved; the coffee had very little taste. When I attempted to make a 10 cup batch, the coffee and grounds overflowed and ran onto the counter. The one asset for this machine-it does make coffee in approximately three minutes. I believe that the reason for the tasteless coffee is in the design. The water flows over the grounds so fast there isn't time to extract all the coffee flavor from the grounds. I would not recommend this unit to anyone who enjoys the full flavor of coffee. This is unfortunate as I had used commercial versions with good results. I have promptly ordered the Cuisinart DCC-1200 which was top rated by Consumer Reports."
2,High dollar coffee pot. Low dollar junk!,"Water runs faster into the coffee filter than from the filter into the pot. Consquently, a run over mess on the counter. Happens 50% of the time. The burner doesn't keep the coffee more than luke warm. High dollar peace of junk."
1,Junk,"overpriced,Junk,Don't bother ordering,much better coffee makers and much cheaper also.Bunn only makes good commercial coffee makers.product arrived in total disaray"
2,Not happy at all,I purchased this coffee maker less than two weeks ago and it made great coffee at first. Now I brew a pot just as I always have and it tastes like water and is just really weak. The basket continues to drip even after the coffee is done. This is my first bunn and obviously my last. My 39.00 coffee maker worked much better. The speed of the bunn is great but what good is speed with no flavor. Very disappointed. If I didnt throw the box away I would have sent it back.THIS IS THE BUNN BTX B WITH THE THERMAL CAFE
1,Really Bad,"I wanted to buy a coffee maker made in the US. This one is really bad.I've owned and used many coffee makers in my lifetime, this is the worst."
2,Leaks,"Have had Bunn's since 1980. Trusted the company, however two Bunns ago, machine rusted out where heating element enters into tank, and my current Bunn, a GRX-B, is also leaking. Bunn use to make a good product, however not as of late. Ready to switch brands! It does, however, make a wonderful pot of coffee. Just get use to the water it leaks on your counter."
2,"Should have gotten something else, but can live with it so will",not really sure that I like this - it's definitely fast - you have to have filter and coffee in because the minute you pour the water in you have to quickly - VERY QUICKLY - place coffee pot on burner as the coffee IMMEDIATELY starts to come through - just something else to remember - if coffee not in before water - you immediately get water - no time for reaction and fix
3,ok,"It is quick but the grinds get in the pot. Also, when pouring, the top must be up. If not, it will leak out."
5,GREAT coffee maker!,I bought this coffee pot for my husband who is the primary coffee drinker in our house. He loves this pot. He says it makes the best coffee and it brews quick for his morning routine. Bunn filters are recommended by my husband and the manufacturer....they are easy to find!
5,Great coffee maker,We purchased this coffee maker to replace a Mr. Coffee that failed after just 4 short months. This coffee maker is great. It brews the coffee in under 3 minutes and the coffee actually tastes good. This is a great coffee maker for anyone who loves coffee!
4,Bunn Coffee Brewer,"This is probably about the 3 or 4th Bunn coffee maker we have bought. We like the fact that it brews the coffee quickly. When this one quits, we'll probably get another Bunn."
5,Crowd Pleaser,"Not everything has to be for me, routinely making monetary investments for the sake of others. So while I didn't purchase my Bunn coffeemaker through Amazaon (found it $10.00 cheaper elsewhere), a coffeemaker for daily use wasn't my objective, being a one cup in the morning on a cold day if I have the time sort of coffee drinker (instant coffee stored in my freezer). Running an electric coffeemaker 24/7 for an occasional cup simply isn't practical. For family gatherings and entertaining, however, I loathe the idea of serving instant coffee to my guests, wanting to serve the best tasting coffee possible. When those occasions arise, my Bunn is waiting in the cabinet, which produces a most excellent tasting brew. When my guests have gone home, my Bunn is drained, cleaned, dried and stored until the next occasion (sorry, those showing up unannounced must drink instant). For quality and flavor (and the enjoyment of coffee lovers I know), I think it worth the money."
5,"if you like coffee, you will love Bunn","This is the king of making coffee, makes a pot of coffee in 40 seconds. It holds water in it preheated, so when you dump in water it pushes the hot water out and your drinking! My last one was about this same model and i had it 6 years, had to take it apart and do some descaling at the 3 year mark. I have very hard water (artisian spring). I make 3 or 4 pots a day, you do have to run this little spring up the tube where the water comes out, but im sure it depends on how soft your water is. I fyou use distilled water, it would never be a problemn."
3,bunn coffeepots,"I have always had Bunn coffee pots but the last two I have gotten, the top burner has gone bad. I think I am going to try another type of coffee pot this time. This time it lasted only 8 months. My last one lasted a little over a year."
5,Coffee Maker,Bunn makes excellent products and having fresh brewed coffee in three minutes is the cat's meow.
1,Makes weak coffee,"This coffee maker will not allow you to make a strong pot of coffee. If you add more grounds than is recommended (which is weaker than any coffee you can buy at and coffee shop) the filter basket overflows with grounds. If you like weak coffee this is the pot for you. If you like medium to strong, look elsewhere."
2,Bunn....Stay true to what you do best. Professional coffee Pots,"You get what you pay for......time and time again I have found that when looking for quality items you must spend quality prices. Had the VP17 professional model but leaked and took up so much counter space. Decided that BUNN is the brand to beat and proceeded to look at their homeowner models. My mistake. They do not make coffee hot nor quickly. This unit is no different than the $ 50 coffee units sold at Walmart and Target. If your looking for ""another"" coffee pot this will work fine. If your looking for fast and hot....you have to go Pro....Bunn VP series. This is not BUNN's fault... It's mine. Bunn made a model to compete with dept. stores. It is not what I want."
1,fast not always best,"I got this for my father and sent it back. It WAS quick-a little too quick-so the coffee had little flavor. Then we made the coffee stronger, but the preheated water (which is prepared in advance and on ""STAND BY"") is a bit stale and leaves a funky taste on second pot. I have used the Bunn big systems, and they are great. If you are in a hurry or need to make multiple pots, use the two pot system. This is really....well...pretty lousy."
4,Coffee in minutes!,"This is our second Bunn and we like the Bunn because it makes coffee literally in 3 minutes! Our first one was recalled and Bunn offered a deal to either replace it or upgrade to a different model for $50.00 and we decided to upgrade with the model that has the two stainless water holding tanks. We had it about 4 or 5 years and it began to leak from the water holding tanks. We checked out the single serve coffee makers but decided the cost of the coffee would be a bit much for us. For the cost of this coffee maker that makes excellent coffee in an instant we decided to try the Bunn again, just hope they worked the bugs out! It's not the most stylish one and may not work for the ""Now Generation"" tastes, but fast quality coffee, it's the charm for us!"
4,Great Coffee at a great price!,"Bunn lives up to its name with this coffee maker, Good Quality, reasonably priced. Highly recommend!"
1,Not worth the aggravation!,"BUNN GRXB Original 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, BlackMy first one lasted a few years before leaking...but this one was ordered November 19 and arrived in two days. On the third day of coffee making it simply poured water all over my sink and down over to the floor. I thought it was something I had done, but no, no matter what I adjusted it did the same thing. I'm afraid of being electrocuted! Never again will a Bunn grace my kitchen again. Save yourself the trouble and pass this one up."
2,"Adequate, but a long way from ideal","I bought this coffee maker to replace another product that I hated. I have seen these coffee makers used in restaurants all over the country. I got the thing home and it definitely has some cool features, one of which is that it always keeps a pot of water at temperature so as soon as you close the lid, it begins brewing - FAST! The downside is that the unit would overflow while brewing if you used more than 6 scoops of grounds. This makes for kind of a weak brew, which I don't like. Every time I've tried to experiment with adding more grounds, it overflows and I spend the next 10 minutes having to clean up the mess. I am not satisfied with this purchase, but after spending so much money for it, I am forced to continue using it until I feel I've gotten my money's worth out of it."
5,Coffee in a flash,The Bunn makes really quick coffee. I like the heating plate that keeps the coffee hot until you turn it off. I had a stainless steel carafe on my old Krups and it did not keep your coffee hot so I like the glass carafes much better. Not a lot of bells and whistles on the Bunn. I think the more things you have on a coffee maker the more that goes wrong with it. I just want to brew a good cup of coffee and the Bunn does this and quick. I have no problems or complaints with my Bunn.
2,kind of disappointed now...,"I bought the BUNN GRB Velocity Brew 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, Black at walmart two weeks ago for the same price here of $99.00. At first i was happy with it from all the raving reviews here at Amazon I couldnt go wrong... But after two weeks i kind of wish i had gotten something else...The coffee tastes great could be a little warmer though..i just checked the water temp of a pot and it was at 178 degrees and it advertises 200. Also there is a burning smell like of wire coming from the water lid area that kind of makes me nervous about leaving it on all the time. I researched the smell and came across this site of complaints [...] I wish i was aware of all this before.. It looks like Bunn has dropped the ball on their manufacturing of home coffee makers.. I wish now i had gotten something else..thought i was buying the best..but got bunned"
3,Disappointed,"I am mystified as to why this coffeemaker has received so many high reviews. I have to use twice the amount of coffee that I did with my previous cone-filter Starbucks maker to get remotely near the same strength of coffee (I make only 4-6 cups at a time). It uses electricity 24/7 to keep the water in the reservoir hot, which I'm sure also adds unneeded heat in my kitchen. You also have to use Bunn coffee filters, which are taller, to prevent overflow of the coffee grounds."
3,Grounds in your cup,"The GRX-B produces a good cup of coffee in about three minutes. HOWEVER, the water comes into the filter so quickly that it can barely drain through the filter before overflowing and getting grounds into your cup. Modifying the density of the ground coffee had minimal effect on this problem."
5,outstanding performances,"This is a marvellous performance. Incidentally, the conductor is Claudio Abbado, not Aggado."
2,Not for tall people,"Did not like this polo because it was not long enough. Even the xtra large was too short--basically the large but wider/looser/baggier.I am 6ft1, and I like clothes that fit. If you are not that tall and slightly rotund, or like clothes that just hang on you but don't fit, then this shirt might be ok for you. Good assortment of colors though."
1,Ridiculous and Pointless,"This is perhaps one of the most utterly pointless texts on the face of the Earth. If I could give it less than one star, I would. It seriously is that bad. Your time could be much better spent staring at a blank wall than taking a course taught from this book. The author is nothing but a complete blowhard who has absolutely no idea about anything. The text is nothing more than an old man's incoherent ramblings. For anyone to think that there is ANY educational value to be gained from this book they would have to be a complete blathering idiot. If you plan on using this book in a course, please save yourself some money and do your students a favor and just let them stare at a blank wall. I promise you, they will gain just as much, if not more, from doing that than they would from this book."
5,Perfect Diaper Bag!,"This is the perfect solution for moms on the go (or dads...). I bought this as a dipaer bag for my toddler. Since he is now older - I don't bring a ton of stuff out with me like when he was younger. Thus - downsizing to this bag was great. Sling on the shoulder, grab the kid and go. It is waterproof - so cleans easily for any spills, leaky bottles, etc. Outer pockets are great and even an inside pocket. We love it!"
4,Surprisingly perfect,"This bag is terrific. It's small enough that things don't get too totally lost, but big enough to fit an 8.5 x 11"" folder. As Mary Sunshine said in her review, it's very easy to clean, and the rubber bottom makes it less of an issue to set it down where you might otherwise hesitate. Plus, the rigid bottom keeps the bag more upright. My only complaint is that it takes two hands or some contortions to open the bag while it's resting on my shoulder. because the shoulder strap isn't as big as it would be on a full-sized tote. I've always thought that would be a deal-killer, but I find myself using this bag more than any other."
5,Top Notch,"I got this dictionary a couple of years ago. It has an amazing amount of detail on a broad number of computer topics. Most everything I have wanted to define is in here, minus proprietary terms specific to a particular vender of course. But amazingly, most general industry terms are defined. Well done."
4,This Album Brings it back,Disco Funk o Rama... great listen! Sexy smooth voices lingering with eclectic sometimes disco music.
3,Luscious Jackson - 'Natural Ingredients' (Capitol),"First of the artist's four CD's.As most of you know,this isn't some cheezy spin-off featuring either of the Jackson girls.You know,La Toya,Janet or Michelle(I mean,Michael).Best described as alternative pop.Noticed some nicely done smooth vocals coupled with sensuous musical interludes.Tracks that should do it for most fans are ""City Song"",""Energy Sucker"",""Strongman"",""Rock Freak"" and maybe ""Deep Shag"".Might appeal to fans of The Breeders,Sean Lennon,Josephine Wiggs and Buffalo Daughter."
