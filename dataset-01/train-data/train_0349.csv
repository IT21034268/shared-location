4,a raw yet elegant coming of age story; hablas espagnol?,"'All the Pretty Horses' is a very well written saga of a teenage boy from Texas, circa 1940s, wandering off down to Mexico with his buddy. Both guys are horsemen. Their Mexican adventure turns sour very quickly and they are then thrust into a mix of love, death and everything in between. The author's prose and characterizations are perfect. The only reason I don't give this book five stars is because I found the heavy use of Spanish dialogue to be very distracting. Although oftentimes one can get the gist of what was being said, too many times I was left puzzled. Yes, the use of Spanish did add quite a bit to the feel of the story. I think it would have been helpful if the author supplied translations (in footnotes, for example).Bottom line: quite an amazing story, .. and I don't even like horses. Recommended."
2,A sad depressing story,"This is a rather depressing story - I don't understand why all the good reviews. The author has an irritating style of not clearly identifying who is speaking, so you have to kind of interpret who is saying what much of the time. Wasn't very enjoyable to read."
1,Just don't bother--,"The abridgment makes the most sense in this book of the trilogy, but this is not a work to abridge. Literary fiction should never be abridged.Brad Pitt's reading is better for this book than for the others also. (Pitt does not even bother to approximate Spanish phonology and seems bored by the task of reading.)Still a pitiful enough effort that you should seek an unabridged version read by someone else.Some reviews on this page either do not refer to the audio version or do not refer to this audio version. Caveat emptor."
2,Worst Book Ever ..,"I had to read this book for an Advanced Literature course I took last semester. If this book is any indication of how the rest of McCarthy's work is, I'd rather not read anymore. The first 100 or so pages of the book, the most exciting thing that happens is when they are riding through Texas and the tumbleweed rolls past them. If this book is supposed to be one of the closest adaptations as to the way the old west was, then we are being left with a lot to be desired."
1,yowch!,"Flaubert once said words the effect that if your writing doesn't correspond to the rhythm of the human lungs it ain't worth squat. And this stuff, with its pompous drawn out sentences, ain't worth squat either."
2,All the pretty conjunctions,I though the book was O.K. and that it was thoughtful and evocative of emotion at some points but that the overwhelming problem with it was the never-ending continuation of sentences which began to get on my nerves and admit it got on yours too especially since there was no punctuation whatsoever in many cases and you just got more and more frustrated as he just kept refusing to add a single comma and if he had it certainly would have helped a little bit and in conclusion while this was an interesting and at times very emotional while remaining intellectually objective book I just got sick of the lack of punctuation and frankly I dont think I would read other stuff by the guy until he learns to drop the conjunctions for once and finish a simple sentence.
3,Zzzzzzzzz...,"I read up to seven novels a month, classical and modern literature alike. This novel is probably one of the most disengaging books I have ever read. Not only did I not finish the book, I had a extremely hard time keeping my mind on the story. I give it three stars because it was beautifully worded and it was very desriptive. As far as a plot goes, there was none."
3,Hard to put down.,The story was excellent but difficult to read at times. Unless you know Spanish plan to skip over conversations.
4,Good read that keeps going and going,"I liked this book right from the start.I'd already read The Road (took me 22 hours) and No Country For Old Men, so I was a bit familiar w/ McCarthy's style.I had read 1/2 of Blood Meridian, but found it a bit tough to read, so I wanted something that read quicker.I gave this 4 stars, only because I'm super picky. A 5 star rating would need to totally rock my world, which this book didn't.But it was a very good read.The movie was very close to the book. I recommend watching the movie AFTER reading the book, which is normally the case."
5,"Compelling story, but.......","The story was first rate, and I found myself very involved with the characters. But, CM's lack of quotation marks and use of run-on sentences drove me to distraction! A story that should have been a beautiful and lyrical read was continually interrupted because I had to go back to the beginning of a dialogue to figure out who said what. Ditto for the run-on sentences - he would start a sentence talking about one thing, and end it on a completely different subject. If I had the book with me right now, I would cite examples. I will only recommend this book to very patient readers, and I will tell them to persevere... because, buried in that grammatical mess is a wonderful story. Everbody else should wait for the movie. If Hollywood stays true to the story, it will be a winner!"
4,More readable than Faulkner- barely,"I would consider this a masterpiece but for one thing- large amounts of the dialog is in Spanish. I damn myself for quiting on Spanish after the Ninth grade but that self-criticism doesn't help me now. This would make a great movie but for the fact that there are few talented, serious directors left in film."
4,Pretty Good Start,"I read this book on the recommendation of my daughter who has a PhD in English Literature. I thought is was pretty good, in fact, good enough to order and read the second in the series, which was merely ""OK."" That ended my interest. There are so many things that really need to be read, that there is no point in continuing to invest time in a series that was deteriorating."
4,All the Pretty Horses,I liked this book. Only thing I had a problem with is that much of the dialog is in Spanish with no interpetation. At times it was difficult to follow what was happening.
5,Required summer read made simple,"We are required to read several books through the summer break. This was one of the books required. I got online, found the book, and it was delivered promply."
4,understated cormac mccarthy,"a little more romance (unfulfilled),a little less violence, blood shedthan in the usual mccarthy.good read, always wishing for a more upbeat ending. ."
4,"Idyllic , descriptive & adventurous",All the Pretty Horses is a book about a boy named John Grady who sets off for Mexico with his friend. Along the way they endure many hardships that change their perspective on life. When John Grady falls in love he learns how oppressive social classes can be. McCarthy's use of imagery provokes such beautiful images in the readers mind. His style conveys the heartache and struggle for survival that surges through John Grady at times. We highly recommend that you read this book!! We had to read it for an English class and everyone loved it!!!
2,"While the dialogue was readable, my interest kept waning","The story of John Grady did not hold my interest as I thought it would when I bought this ""award winning"" book. It moved very slowly most of the time and I found it difficult to stay tuned. A few scenes were riveting but most of the book was a chore for me to finish. Melvilles Moby Dick comes to mind, another book that had far to many long spaces between the part that were compelling"
4,Searing coming of age story set in Texas and Mexico i,A wonderful book. Cormac McCarthy's writing reminds me of Jim Harrison's books. Echoes of Faulkner and Thomas Wolfe as well with the exuberant stylized prose. The conversation between John Grady and his lover's grandmother is one of the most vivid conversations I have ever read. Another scene involving a red hot pistol and a bullet wound will live in my memory forever. If you love beautful writing you will enjoy this book. If you are a fan of Jim Harrison's books you will find this trilogy a delight.
4,"""It's a Western, with horses and guns, but deeply funny""","For me McCarthy is the modern-day Faulkner: his themes are dark and unsettling, but as All the Pretty Horses shows, he can also be deeply funny. Though to be sure, this is no comedic novel. It's a Western, and adventure with horses, guns and coming of age for the protagonist, John Grady Cole, the last of a long line of Texas ranchers. And that's the core of the book, the sense that America is shrinking, that there is no room left for cowboys or adventurers. There's a great line in the book that John's buddy Rawlins says to him as they set off to Mexico on their adventure. ""I could understand if you was from Alabama you'd have ever reason in the world to run off to Texas. But if you're already in Texas. I don't know."""
1,One of the worst books I have ever read,"I was forced to read this book for a freshman level english class in college, several years ago. I have to say, I was very let down. When put in a list next to the greats and classics, this book does not stand up. The love story is a poorly written jumble of words and I was frankly just not impressed."
3,"Tired of reading the word ""and""!!","It's an interesting book, but it is very hard to read as Mr McCarthy really likes the word ""and""!! I swear the book would be half as thick if he left that word in only the deserving places. Where is your Junior High school english teacher? Probably rolling in his grave! If you can get past his overly repetative and jumpy style then the story is pretty good except that he makes these 16 and 17 year olds way beyond their wisdom as he wrote with the mind of a daydreaming old man not in touch with teenagers. Sorry,, but there it is!"
3,Nice horsey. Nuff said.,"This book is about a young boy, who's grandpa has died. His grandpa had a huge ranch but unfortunately his daughter decided to sell it. So the daughter's young son, John Grady Cole, age 16, moves to the uncivilized land of Mexico to become a true cowboy and start a name for himself. As he herds cattle and breaks in horses for a living the adventure begins. He encounters with angry Mexican soldiers and has a good time with a beautiful woman. We'd type more but then we'd give away too much of the book. So go read the book for yourself!This book was difficult to read because of a lack of punctuation and the frequent Spanish dialect. Although, hard to read the story was very good and touching. We had a wonderful time reading and discussing this book. It may have very well brought us closer together as friends."
1,this is an award winner?,"McCarthy's strange and inventive way of writing with no quotations and few apostrophies is not, to me, correct grammar. His run on sentences, some with more than 10 ""ands"" in them, are very distracting. If someone is going to give a person an award for a book, I think they should have guidelines, such as using correct english."
3,Two Boys becoming men are searcing for independence.,The book was hard to understand at first and slow but after the intro. of all the characters and their life time stories. It had many hidden symbols that would effect us today such as raceisum.
5,"beautiful words, great story","I read this book on the recommendation of an old friend and had difficulty putting it down. The descriptions of Mexico and horses were beautiful. The plot was engaging and the characters, John Grady Cole in particular, were like old friends by the end of the book. The story was an exciting and suspenseful page turner. From the standpont of pure enjoyment, I can't imagine anyone not liking this book. I liked it so much I went right out and bought The Crossing."
5,Finally....A TRUE book...,This book touched home So much!!! Thank you so much for putting it in print. It was like reading my daughter and myself writing this book. Hopefully our goverment will one day soon see the epidemic we have going on with persciption drug abuse...and help our families. Thank You again for making me see the light....I cried alot reading this but only because it is so accurate!!!
5,"gut wrenching, courageous and hopeful","I just finished the book. It is hard to put down. If you have an addict in your life, especially a child, this book can inspire you to do the hard things that can help your addict and not to do the things that enable them to continue down the road of distruction. I applaud the authors for their transperancy and courage to share their story of pain, heartbreak, betrayel. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a child that is and addict/alcoholic/"
5,Heart gripping,"This is a beautiful, yet painful, story to read. It is so honest. Warning: once you pick it up and start reading, it is almost impossible to put down until you finish it. Not only is this a touching and poignant story, it is also an education for those who have been touched by alcoholism or drug use. Highly recommend reading this book."
5,Mom of two addicts...very touching book,"A very difficult book to read emotionally, for me. I couldn't put it down, and if you or a loved one are battling substance abuse, and addiction ... the tears will flow."
5,The Lost Years,"I highly recomend this book for anybody who has a family member or friend of abuse. It is very inspiring, and hopefull for those people who are also the addict, it proves your life can become normal again. The character Kristina found she could lead a very productive life and help many other families. I now have hope for my loved one."
3,"Heartfelt, but an amateur effort","The authors of this book - Kristina and her mom, Connie - write from their hearts. It's obvious that they've dug deep into themselves and tell the unflinching truth, even if it means casting themselves in the worst light possible. However, the book was written in such a sophomoric fashion that it really took me out of the story. I think a better editor would have greatly benefited this book. Of course, Kristina and her mom are not authors, and that's where a good editor should have stepped in. The text was riddled with grammatical errors, poor sentence structure, and flat prose. It's a pity, considering the writers are such honest storytellers."
4,Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare,"I couldn't put it down... anybody who has a close one involved in drugs, should read this book (and have them read it too...), the daughter shouln't be alive today, she was just lucky... Good for all of us, she has life changing lessons to share with us now..."
5,Life changing,"This book touched my heart, I've know addicts and have watched them change their lives .this girl has over come more in years then some do in a life time."
5,Incredible story!!,This book is so powerful and a must read for those families suffering with addition. It changed my life.
5,Amazing,"I listened to this mother and daughter speak at my school and what they said was amazing. Both of them were willing to share their difficult journey with us, and tell us what addiction and the road out of addiction are really like. I cannot wait to read the book and I highly recommend listening to what these two women have to say."
5,Excellent read.,"This is a great book. It reads more like a story, but has a lot of good information in it. The daughter especially writes well. Her ability to describe her experiences is extremely well done. You feel her. The mom also is a good writer. The only thing I think she could have done better is explain how she went from one extreme to the other with her daughter. I think for the average mother out there they might find her approach rather harsh. I agree with her approach, but think maybe a little more details as to how she became so firm would be helpful for some mothers. But, overall I really liked this book and would highly recommend it. I think it is a very hopeful book, but not for a weak stomach because it is very graphic as to what a drug addict on the streets can and does go through. It is heart wrenching, but very real. Great job to both authors."
5,It had me after two pages,"I read the first two pages of The Lost Years and didn't want to put the book down. It was fascinating to read the two sides of the stories simultaneously and electrifying to see how close mother and daughter were linked even when they were not in communication with each other. It's one of the best ""tough love"" stories I've ever read. And, what an inspiration to any parent with children who are ""lost"" and to any person that is fighting any kind of addiction."
5,Fantastic memoir,"This book is incredible. I'd read a lot of stuff about addiction, but nothing like this. It's honest, straightforward, and I stayed up until 4 am becasue I just had to finish it!I'd never read something where you get to see both sides of the story. It's so beautifully written, you can tell how much the mother loves her daughter, and how she found the strength to walk away from her, because she knew she couldn't do any more to ""save"" her is heartbreaking and really inspirational all at the same time.Addiction affects so many of us, and this book is the only one I've read which really nails it."
5,A fascinating read...,"I saw a few programs on The Learning Channel called ""Addicted"". I was intrigued by Kristina's opener briefly explaining her life on the streets and on drugs. I wanted to see if she had written any books about her life and I found this one. I thought it was a very powerful book. She and her mother are both so open and honest. It's a heart wrenching story with a happy ending. I highly recommend this book. It would be very beneficial to any family facing addiction."
5,Quick Read,"Having seen the Mother & Daughter on the TODAY Show, I was aware of their story. But reading the details was mesmerizing. Usually these stories are told from one perspective - the addict. Being exposed to the family dynamics prior to addiction, seeing the mother's agony, the daughter's desperation, and how all of this impacts the family, should help families who have experienced issues with addiction gain insight to the bigger picture."
5,Very Moving,I found this book particularly compelling and from the heart. Only a writer who had really lived through these events could relate them with such heart wrenching conviction.
3,"i heard ""Texas Party"" on the radio today I liked the song","Based on""Texas Party"" which I heard on the radio today, I am going to buy this record. After I listen to all the songs and artists, I can comment"
2,Wobbles after a while,"I played intramural wallyball in college(3+yrs) and now I have been at it again for 3 months, 1 hour a week. Cheap balls start to lose their shape with agressive play. This is a cheap ball. It will hold up for a little bit, but if you want to get consistent play from a wallyball, pony up a few more dollars for a better ball, otherwise you will be shopping for a another one soon."
2,Short life span wallyball,I bought several of these balls and not one of them lasted more than a month or two. These balls get used twice a week for about two hours per session. Within a very short time the balls start to develop lumps on the surface. If you are looking for a ball with any longevity - this is not it.
2,Doesn't hold up,"We play every week and play hard, but this ball didn't last 6 months. Starts out fine, but the surface loses the grip after a while. Also, one brand new ball had a leak straight out of the box. Some start to crack on the surface, but they are rec center balls, and I don't know how they are treated.Tried the green and orange ball sold elsewhere. The green part has great traction, but the orange is slick. I don't recommend that ball either."
3,"i'd like this more, but there's some songs in the way","I listen to this album because I like my bloody valentine so much -and loveless is a little strong and easy to overdose on. There are some songs on this album that i can't live without and then there's the songs that I wish I had never heard.Gee angel is cute and I want to like it, but the lyrics kill it. And then there's 'explode and make up' and 'can't believe what you're saying' that kill me. They're fantastic. These are exactly the kind of powerful, heart wrenching songs that make Bob Mould great."
1,A cheap cutout for a reason,"I bought this when it came out because I moderately like ""Believe What You're Saying"" and figured I would give it a try. Sadly, that was the only worthwhile or tolerable song on the album -- and even that one now doesn't do as much for me as it did when I first heard it on the radio.The main problem is that all of the songs get bogged down in that sort of white-noise mush that unfortunately many bands still think is cool. No instruments stand out -- everything is just a bunch of nondescript jet roar.This makes every song sound almost exactly alike. Most of them have no good melodies to speak of and try to survive on the ""roar."" It doesn't work. The sound is WAYYYY too trebly and gets incredibly annoying after a few songs. After a while, everything just blends into one another and there ceases to be any ""songs"" on the album -- just noisy instruments doing, well, *something*. And that something isn't very engaging.Give this one a miss."
3,Only half-good,"The great thing about Husker Du was the balance between Bob Mould's frequently furious songs and Grant Hart's more accessible pop sensibility.Here, of course, it's all Bob Mould, and therefore the songs start sounding very indistinguishable from one another. There are only a few stand-out tracks, like ""Believe What You're Saying."" The others just get weighted down in the white-noise-guitar-wash production."
2,Just Bob Being Bob,"No matter what he calls himself, Bob Mould pretty much sounds the same. Mould&#65533;s brand of sludgy hard rock seems to appeal to some, but I can&#65533;t imagine why. I mean sure he&#65533;s had OK tracks (not on this album though) but to me he seems more like a hack than an innovator."
5,Bob Mould will eat hipster music and this album proves it,"If you like the folk music that passes as rock today (looking at you Mumford and Sons) you will probably not like this album. Well you might in some ironic way that I will never understand, because I was not there.It's Bob Mould rocking out, it's a good thing."
4,"Great album, but nothing new","This was a great album in the 90s and it holds up today. Packed with bonus material, if you were a casual fan back in the day, you'll find a ton new stuff here. Unfortunately, I purchased all the singles and the Besides CD a couple of decades ago, so I already have all of this. Nothing new...heck it's not even complete.Still, a great album, and well worth listening to again."
5,Steal Of the Decade at $5.00!!!,"Wow, these remastered tracks are SO sharp and powerful and jacked compared to the originals - I keep flipping back and forth and it's night & day. Plus a few of the live tracks are ones I'd never before heard. Even at $10 this would be a great deal. My highlights are Mind Is An Island, Going Home, Gift, Gee Angel, Can't Help You Anymore, and those last three tracks live. My only (minor) disappointment is the live interpretation of Going Home, one of my top 3 Sugar tracks of all time. Didn't quite have the ""holy S"" punch like most of the others. But hey, 34 tracks is quite the array to choose your own faves!"
3,Amazed,I have the original 6 song EP. Who'da thunk that a little Eclectic anti-frat college punk band like this would end up releasing a full CD let alone 2. Fit the time...Not for everyone. But anyone from Chico in the mid to late 80's will wax nostalgic.
1,Card Collector Review,"I have used two versions of the product, 6 and 7, on both with different PC's and Operating Systems my database which contains all of my inputted information became corrupted. After contacting tech support and forwarding them my database file he replied back within 30 minutes I would have to re-enter my entire collection and start over for the third time. With thousands of cards to enter you can imagine my frustration. Needless to say I can not recommend this product. ..."
2,Sometimes noise is just that: noise,"I bought this CD because I really like a couple songs on their other CD, Life and Soul. I made it through half way of my second honest attempt to listen all the way through before I just couldn't take listening anymore. I have no idea how Anywayawanna had more UK hits than Life and Soul, but apparently my tastes do not match the Brits (and not just my disdain for warm beer and overly fried fish sticks). This CD is a collection of songs that lack the creativity and passion of songs on Life and Soul. But purchases like these sometimes land some amazing gems (I found Deep Dish Yoshiquesque Two that way). That just wasn't the case here."
4,I see you,"My daughter loves this toy! I got it for her when she was 8 months since she loved to look at herself in the mirror. And it was easy for her to figure out how to make the music play besides loving to spin the beads and make noise. I play with her ""I see you"" in the mirror and she cracks up. She looks in the mirror and smiles by herself and cracks up spinning the wheel too. She's 9 months now and still plays with it occasionally."
4,Great item for a new born.,"We put it in the cradle with our newborn daughter. It worked out great. She just barely had to touch it to turn it on and it would calrm her down. Once she gets bigger, I'm sure she is going to love looking at herself in the mirror."
2,Quit Working,"I purchased this product for my 2 month old daughter. It worked great at first. She really liked the lights and the music. However, after about a week it quit working? I replaced the batteries twice and it does not work. Now, my daughter just looks in the mirror at herself. I am not sure if I would recommend this product."
1,sparkling symphony mirror,"my son got it of christmas he was six mos and loved it the switich to make the music go for long periods at a time ,now that he is 10 mos and still has fun i truned to switch to music that is shorted so it encourges him to set it off,he has a blast. one thing i'm not so crazy about it is that when i lay him dowm to sleep if it's not truned off the music started if hit by self or nathan."
4,this toy is alot of fun to look at but...,i saw this toy in the supermarket while i was shopping with my son who was about two months old. i rolled the little roller and it lit up and so did my son's eyes. i had to have it because he responed so well to it. when we got it home we played with it a while and then i realised that to use it as intended for young babies i was going to have to hang it in his crib. ( he didnt sleep in his crib yet hehe) now my son is 4 months old and sleeps in his crib but i never put him in his crib during the day. thus the usefulness of this toy is somewhat limited. when he can sit he will probably enjoy playing with it. i would recomend this toy for ages 6 months and up as a real great interactive toy but it is a waste for a new baby who cannot handle it and doesnt spend lots of time cooped up in his crib.
2,We have had 2 and neither work right,"Well, this WOULD be a great toy if we could get one that worked. The first one we had would work ok for the first day or 2 and then would stop until we reinserted the batteries. At first i thought the batteries were dead, but we went through 3 or 4 sets. If we reinserted them the toy would work perfectly, but only for about 2 days. So i called fisher-price, who sent out a replacement and assured me it would be factory tested. Well, it does the same thing. It is too much bother to keep unscrewing the battery compartment to get it to work, so we just use it as a mirror. My son still likes to spin the toy at the bottom; too bad the thing doesn't work right. I wonder if anyone else has had this problem, or if i just happen to keep getting defective ones?"
3,Great toy for a variety of ages,"My son has played with this toy since he was very little. He is now 2 years old and still plays with it for hours. He plays with it at nap times before going to sleep-sometimes for an hour or more. We need to buy another one in case this one breaks! Educationally, I figure he is at least learning the concept of cause and effect by playing with it. I bought another one for our younger son and it only works a couple of days and then you have to replace the battery. One has been great and the other one doesn't really work. I have had problems with many of our Fisher Price toys but if you get one that works as well as our first one you will be glad you bought it!"
4,disappointed,"I was at first very please with the star. The music was not too loud like a other products, it is easy to spin, and the mirror is a nice size. I was VERY disappointed with the fact that I have to change batteries after a couple of days use. I even turned it off and only used it at certain times, but it still seeming to drain the batteries very quickly."
3,"Not for crib scoochers, but great otherwise.","I've had this in my daughter's crib since birth. When my 2-month-old daughter sleeps in her crib, she somehow manages to 'scooch' herself over to the railing and always rams her head against this toy. This toy is not padded, so be careful when using it for new tummy babies or babies that 'scooch' around on their backs in the crib. UPDATE - She figured this toy out at 3 months and LOVES it! It's great to keep her busy in the morning when she's awake and I still want to sleep! She finally got bored with it at 8 months. Not a bad runtime!"
3,Classic fun for a newborn,"I bought this mirror for my 3 month old son. I returned the first one that I bought because we could not get the lights to turn on...yes we put new batteries in it! We are having the same problem with the new one they sent me. It seems to turn on at random times. Even without lights or music he loves it and at his age it seems to be one of the only toys that can capture his attention. I would recommend this toy, but I do think if the lights and music worked it would be a little more fun for him."
3,I see a good future,"I bought this for my daughter before she was born because I thought it would be a good toy, and it was one of the few that had an age recommendation for babies under 3 mos. However, I feel that Amazon.com's age is more fitting. My daughter is about 2 mos old and has only just recently begun to pay attention to it. With the music setting on continuous play, the sounds and lights hold her attention and it is the first toy that she has reached for...even causing attempts at rolling over to get to it. I feel that once she gets a bit older the toy will be good at teaching hand/eye coordination, cause/effect relationships, and will also help w/musical interests. The volume is at a good level and although I don't mind the music at all, my husband finds it extremely annoying--he says it's out of tune. Overall I think that this is a pretty good toy, but that it's best utilized after baby is 3 mos."
3,entertaining,"the only problem we have found with this crib toy is once babies get a bit more active in the crib, they can bump it in the night and the music and lights start and wake them up, therefore it needs to be in the off position most of the time which doesn't really make it much fun. We have both this and the peaceful planet aquarium, and the peaceful planet aquarium by far has been more successful for us."
2,It's out of tune.,"If you're looking for someting to help develop your child's musical ear, as this product's manufacturer claims it will, this product is worse than nothing because the melodies are out of tune. If you're looking for a crib mirror, this may not be a bad choice. My 5-month old has not been terribly interested in it as an interactive toy, and in any event, there are many others available in this price range."
2,Maybe ours just doesn't work right.,"We've been disappointed with this toy right from the start. The blinking lights weren't very bright -- hardly noticeable. The spinning bar wasn't anything the baby was interested in. The tunes are soft and appealing to the adult ear, so it wasn't all that bad for the parent. It just wasn't anything that appealed to our baby. Even now that she is older, there are other musical toys that she finds more appealing. Somehow, we just skipped by this one without fanfare."
5,great for all ages,"We just got this toy from Amazon & my kids love it. ages 3 1/2 yrs. 20 mo. & 9 mo. I got this toy for my 9 mo. old daughter to have in her crib & its great for a crib because its not very loud.While sleeping my little girl bumps the ""spin thing"" that starts the music & lights it does not wake her up, it also has an ""off"" switch. great toy for what it is intended to be...a crib toy!"
2,Two things could be improved on this toy.,"My daughter banged her head several times by pulling this toy away from the crib and then letting go. I found a way to secure the bottom part of the toy to the crib by attaching a string... sort of. Also, I think mine is defective because aproximately every four days it stops working and I have to take out the batteries, and then put them back in (not new ones)and then it works again. It has a nice selection of music, but that's about it. I would reccommend a crib toy made by chicco that has piano and farm animals - my son loves it"
2,A bore.,My 12 month girl will look in the mirror for a couple seconds and spin the dial for music and then moves on. She has no interest in this toy. I thought with the mirror she would love to look at herself.
3,A must for the car and crib,"We couldn't get our six month old to sleep through the night. We put the mirror in his crib, and the wakings decreased and he would play with it in the morning. Also attaches easily to the car seat, so he loved having something fun to play with in the car. The music is great and the flashing lights soothe the baby, and settle him down, once he found out he could start it himself, we had no more problems in the car!"
3,An okay book,"The introduction to the book says that this is a a departure from his previous books, and that is very correct. Throughout the beggining of the novel I forgot there was not a relevant gay character, it seems the author concentrated on the straight boys in the story, while thats not bad, it is different from his previous books in the gay chronicles. Perhaps the intent is to show every shade in the field of growing up and dating, but it seem to loose a bit of the charm from the gay characters in the previous novels.The book itself reads in the same way as the rest chronicles, from the style to the change of point of views, it is an enjoyable read, but definetly not the best. If you are starting out the chronicle Id recommend startin in order from the soccer field is empty."
3,"Defprince review on Big daddy kane's "" taste of chocolate ""","This is a Big Daddy Kane product. Laced with funky beats, comical and dope lyrics. My favourites are "" Cause i can do it right "", ""It's hard being the Kane"", ""No damn good "" and my best one ""Mr pitiful"". Big daddy kane is himself in this album it's seriously funny. If you enjoy ""It's a big daddy thing"", ""Looks like a job for the Kane"" and ""Long live the Kane"" three of his previous albums, then you'll like this one."
3,A good book re-warmed,"This is a good book, but, there is nothing in it that warranteda second edition. Certain areas, such as multicast andmulti-protocol BGP are due for a complete re-write, butthat is barely reflected in the book. In short, the new editionis good-- if you need it, buy it. But, if you already havethe first edition, don't bother, or you will be disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"I dont know what the fuss is all about regarding this book. Ihave been dealing with IP and IPoverATM networks for three yearsnow. All this time I kept hearing people talk about this book so finally I picked it up and find only one word to define the subject treatment 'DRY'. The book has no spark and in certain chapters its totally incoherent, specially the chapter on BGP. The edition that I have does not talk about BGP4.I've always found RFCs as my source of information and I regret wasting time on this book.On a different topic if you like an interesting treatment of IP/ATM integration, read 'Switching in IP networks'. This one definately goes beyond RFCs!"
3,not a bad funkin cd,"these songs have been sampled to death atomic dog features coolio, and shorty, bop gun features ice cube, and knee deep features digital underground not the best place to learn what p funk is all about."
5,Amazing talent; so sad he's gone,"An amazing performance by an amazingly talented man. Burned badly as a baby on a heating duct, his family was told he would never have the use of his hands. God obviously had a different plan. His genius on the piano is evident throughout, making it all the more sad that he died at such a young age. His musicianship is such that you will have goosebumps when hearing it. While ""Masterpiece"" has much of the music featured on ""The Best of Anthony Burger,"" it does not have the telling of his life story. It also has many musical numbers, including some secular, that are not found on ""The Best of Anthony Burger."" One of those is a gospel number in which Mr. Burger sings, ""The Stranger;"" it's worth the price just to hear this piece alone. Buy it, and you won't be sorry."
2,Damaged DVD,"This DVD skips for about the last 3 songs. It did arrive on time, however. Nothing more to day. Thanks."
4,love the lizard,"hey hey, these guys are from Hayward, Wisconsin, where i live every summer. I've seen these guys and i love them! Their music is just very chill. Gotta give these guys props for comin from a small town like that. They mix their styles from sounding like a Jam Band, to 50's doo-wop, and laid back alternitive. I hope they're still rockin!"
3,A Good Conscience,"Sarah is written in a different approach. I like the idea that she is bad, knows she is bad, but feels good about herself anyway. She seems strong and very opinionated."
4,Love the action,This movie had action from beginning to end. The fighting in the movie was awesome. and the story line was good. Not bad for a foreign film
3,"Sy Fy ""B"" movie","Think bad Sy Fy movies and you'll understand. I watched it with my 22 yr old son and it did turn out to be an enjoyable ""MST 3000"" moment. A keeper only for the laughs."
3,America's critic,"I usually like crazy japanamovies, this one fell a lil short, the one girl was deff hot with some big o pretty eyes, the cgi was a lil off i was expecting it to be a lil up, i compared this movie to machine girl and tokyo gore police they are a must see, which are crazy insainly good, this one i would rent or try to catch on netflix."
1,Bad...,The best thing on this movie - is the box picture - the rest is really really bad. Special effects are at the level of maybe 50's or 60's - horrible. But I must admit I did finish the whole movie - just to see what happens - and the ending did not improve the impression.
1,It's Worse Than You Could Ever Imagine,"Wow. It would take days to explain how bad this is. I sometimes enjoy bad b-movies, but not this one. You know how there are sometimes goofy, over the top performances that just make you feel sorry for the actors? Well, that's all this movie is - one long string of embarrassing, cringe-worthy moments. Please avoid."
1,Can't see what you're doing. Terrible design. Don't buy!,I couldn't use these clippers on my daughter's fingers. I couldn't see what I was doing!! It's a cute but terrible design. I bought a summer infant set (home and travel clippers) and am very happy with it.
3,You get what you pay for.,"OK product! Does it job, sometimes does fall off but once the suction cup is moist it does hold up for long."
1,horrible,single suction cup does not work and the placard will fall out after driving around for 30mins. if this had a double suction cup then the design would be much better
4,"Suctions alright, doesn't fade too much","This is fairly small and light, and hangs onto the window quite well, usually. I find myself having to stick it back on the window every once in a while. We've had it for a year and half and it has faded just a bit, but the suction still works as well as it did from the beginning. It has survived all four seasons in upstate NY."
3,Baby on board,"I recently purchased this product bcuz I made a diaper cake for my cousin's baby shower. I received it very quickly, however, the product came in an envelope. It didn't come in the packages shown in description. Therefore, it looks as if it was used. Already on someone's car window and they just stopped it off and sent it 2 me. Good thing I was gonna take it out the package anyway to put on the diaper cake. But, if this was going to be a gift I would have sent but back bcuz it was not in it's original packaging."
5,Awesome!,All around this is a great product. I live in the city and wanted something that would back off the car behind me a bit. So far its working pretty good. I like that it has the suction cup as opposed to the magnet so it doesn't leave marks. Great item for the price.
2,Doesn't stick to the window,The single suction cup doesn't stick well to the window and keeps falling off. I've seen others who uses clear packing tape to tape it to the back window which is what I'll have to do also.
2,Vacuum suction cap does not work!,Vacuum suction cap does not work for me! I was trying to put it on the rear windshield and it wound not stay for more than 60 seconds. I think that beats the purpose...
2,Opaque signs,"These ""baby on board"" signs are small and inexpensive, but because they are opaque, they create a visibility problem by obstructing part of the view, no matter which window you place them on. The suction cup is also prone to detaching no matter what you do (including cleaning the window with alcohol wipes and moistening the cup itself with good old saliva). I should have bought something that's see-through so I can see everything unobstructed, especially when I'm changing lanes while driving at 75 mph."
2,Will melt in summer sun,"We got one of these and within 6 hours of being in our car window, it melted under the summer sun. We got a magnet one, which sticks to the outside of the car, does not obstruct your view and can stand the hot New Mexico sun."
3,Fell off after only a few weeks.,"We bought this product to put in our car when we had a baby. It fell off after only a few weeks, and now it's just laying in the back of the window. Wish it would stay on a little better!"
3,"Excellent music, not the best recording.","Sorry, but here comes my spoiler review, the sort that nobody wants to hear.There are some exciting and quite astonishingly good pieces on this disc, and the playing and especially the percussion are very good. However the dynamics are so all over the place that I can't bear to listen to the whole thing without being within arms length of the CD player so that I can crank the volume up or down as required. I keep meaning to burn this and then use the itunes equalizer to make it istenable without interference, but hey, that was the engineers job.I apologise for dwelling on the recording, but both the music and the musicians deserve better, and I hope that they get it next time."
4,read this,I myself aren't one of these people who like puzzle games much but I still enjoyed chu chu rocket. It is packed with play ability. The only thing that lets it down is the puzzles do get samey. Many of my friends like it as well. it is a landmark in puzzle history! some other good points are the fact that you can play it on the internet and it has fun multiplayer. It has only got one downpoint the graphics arn't very good which like many puzzle games on this and other systems is acceptable.
3,pretty darn fun,"this game is pretty cool, dispite the name, but it's still overated. i honestly thought this was a game for a five year old the first time i saw it but it proved me wrong. the multiplayer mode is much better than the individual mode. a very annoying thing is the mice. they just go around and around in circles, which i guess is the point, but it can get really annoying sometimes but if you want a fun multiplayer game go ahead and buy this game! it's not that expensive and it's pretty darn fun on top of that!"
4,Good game but could have been better.,"Chu chu Rocket is a good game, but once you complete the game it gets boring. The puzzle mode is really hard, but I cleared it. There are other modes like some 4 player ones. Once you complete the puzzle mode, all you get is a new character instead of chu chus. I thought that when you complete the puzzle mode you get another new mode. In puzzle challenge you have 30 seconds to clear the levels, so it's too hard. But you can create some puzzles that it makes the game better."
4,"Great fun, even better with 2 players","If you're looking for a graphic powerhouse style game to show off your Dreamcast, this probably isn't the game you want. But if you want a really fun addictive game that will keep you up solving 150 levels (in the 1 player version), this is the one you want. You can even play this game online. Really! I haven't played another Dreamcast game that actually finds a really good use of the modem built into the system. This one does. Check it out."
4,Get some friends and you'll love it,"This game's puzzle mode is sub-par and pretty boring. But bring in some friends and begin the no-holds-barred multiplayer mode and BANG! Instant fun. If you liked Lemmings, you'll absolutely love Chu Chu Rocket, especially the Two-Player Mission Mode, which is sadly way too short. But the real life of the game is the competitive mode, and it's one you won't want to miss, even if you just have to rent it. This game is fun... don't pass it up for anything! The graphics and sound, however, could have been more without even detracting from the gameplay. Also, the internet mode has enough lag to keep you from really being hooked on it, because it nullifies the quick-decision gameplay."
4,Don't believe the hype,"It's pretty good. Not great. At least not as great as a lot of the reviewers seem to think. You'll spend more time trying to figure out what's going on than you will playing, and the game is so constantly interrupted by mode changes (everybody switch spots, speed up, slow down, cat mania, etc.) that you can rarely get into any type of groove with what's going on. Don't get me wrong - it's frantic, fast, and pretty fun, but it's also often confusing, and some of the level layouts make the gameplay frustrating. The lag times on the on-line version significantly detract from the quick-decision gameplay. If you're looking for a simple 4-player party game that anybody can pick up and enjoy right away (without being a game nut), get Mario Party or Smash Brothers for N64. Chu Chu's a bit too wacked-out, but it's still better than average."
4,Experienced Gamer,"Okay, we sure werent expecting this as the first online multiplayer game on DC. I'm sure a lot of people are going to ignore this game simply because it looks a little weird/boring/ whatever... but those people will be making a big mistake. Believe it or not, this game is great fun for multiple players, and a good challenge for one person (in puzzle mode). Go online and face opponents anywhere in other states/countries in 2-4 player battles. This is a small online community of players and its easy to get to know everyone. The game will keep track of your stats and show your ranking too. I'd recommend this title to fans of action OR puzzle/strategy games. Another classic from Sonic Team!"
4,good,"The basket is OK, but it didn't have any brackets to attach it to a bike. Also it doesn't fit some bikes and might interfere with brake wires. Overall is a useful product for a price."
2,Yuck,"I purchased this bike basket not realizing it didn't screw on. I thought I would have to somehow mount it when i first go it, but it just hangs from the handlebars. One day with nothing in it, it flew off into the middle of the street as i hit a bump! Normally if i carry stuff in it, it adds weight so it doesn't usually fall off. Another thing, since it just hooks on, anyone can steel it when I lock it - I sorta wish someone would steal it so i can buy a new one (one that needs to be mounted). Its not really level either, AND it covers up my front reflector - so it makes my bike unsafe. I have been looking for a reflector that can be put onto the front of the basket, but I may just invest in a new basket all together. I should have returned it, but now i dropped my bike and there is a dent in it."
2,Beware your bike,"Basket arrived alright, but to my dismay it wouldn't fit my bike (Schwinn Suburban comfort bike). I managed to do it by bending the back of the basket in the middle a little, but still it is very uncomfortable putting it on with the brake and speed-shift wires getting in the way, not to mention the front reflector, which you have to either remove or shift to the side.Very impractical, I wouldn't buy one like it ever again."
1,Very Bad Design. Ruined My New Kona,"If you have a cheap big box store bike, this is the basket for you. If you take care of your bicycle, or your prized possession is made of aluminum, I urge you to look at my photos. Any bracket that rest on the head tube is trouble because the handlebar rotates independently of the stationary head tube causing friction and the resulting gouge as shown in my photo. I had this bracket on my Kona less than 30 days before I saw what damage it did. I contacted the company that imports them with no success."
3,"It works for me, but not sure if it will fit all bikes","It worked for my cruiser bike, but not sure if it will fit all bikes. If you just lay it on the handlebar using the hooks, the basket is loose (like other reviewer said) and any bump will make it fly off. I had to push it down hard, bend the part between hooks and then I got it to fit, but in the process I scratched the basket and damaged the plastic that covers the metal wires. I cannot easily remove it and put it back when I need it (the way I wanted it), so I leave it on permanently."
2,Wish it fit,"My handlebars are bent forward, and the hand brakes get in the way of the basket. It simply does not fit on my bike. The quality seems decent, though it could be designed better.Unfortunately have to send this back (seller: J Bikes requires to be sent back within 7 days of arrival, what?).What a waste of time."
3,Bike basket in black,"This is a really nice basket. I did have a problem with the fit. It is smaller than some of similar style. The front reflector on my bike got in the way of the basket fitting closely to the frame of the bicycle. This fit makes it difficult to lift off and put back on quickly. I would purchase the larger basket next time, if you are putting it on an adult bike.But it is strong and looks cute."
2,Bike Basket,"The basket in general is good but the hooks for the basket to rest on the bike are small. I can't even hook on the basket to the bike because I forgot that the break wires run in front of the bike, where the handles are located. So keep in mind where the break wires are located on your bike."
2,Bolle Sport Kickback,"As soon as I opened them I was disappointed. I thought they looked and felt cheap. The color was also blue instead of black and the edges were almost rough, as if unpolished. The only good thing about these are that they are light. You can find MUCH better sunglasses on Amazon for the money."
2,It's ok...,"The camera captures very good quality images but there a few things that make it's use cumbersome. First, it takes a fairly long time to warm up (perhaps a minute or more). This makes capturing those special and fleeting moments difficult. By the time the camera is ready to photo our 18-month daughter has moved on... Second, the ability to alternate between viewing photos and taking new ones is slow and unwieldy. In order to view pictures you've already taken, you need to close the lens cover. This is slow because the zoom needs to retract. Similarly, to switch to photo mode from viewing mode, the camera needs to be reopened. Finally, the ability to delete picturs is also quirky. You need to switch to viewing mode to delete and it take a few steps. All of these features make the use of the camera really slow and annoying. I wish I had better things to say but I wouldn't recommend this camera."
4,Not bad at all,"I think this was a damn good camera. Two cons- the battery liffe isn't too long, even with the batteries they give you, and the zoom isn't the greatest. I have never seen such good quality pictures ever- this is the best in its class! SO- if you want a camera get this one! ..."
3,big interface problems,"I love the camera and if I ever get it to interface to my PC I will be thrilled. I have tried everything, ( including reading the instructions)I am fairly technology literate. I own two laptops (an IBM running NT and Dell running Win98) neither of them interface so if you have any tips please email me I have tried calling Olympus but lack the time or patience to sit on hold...so I am not happy....be warned"
4,Good,"Had mine for 3 years now and still works excellent.I ve used it in the woods a lot,broke the front sliding cover off,but still works good without it.Takes excellent photos .A lot of fine tuners on this puppy."
5,Great Camera,"If you're wondering if you can use digital camera, don't hesitate to buy this one! It's easy to use, takes great pictures and if you buy a flash card, you won't have any trouble downloading the pictures and printing them out. The pictures turn out perfect using my HP 930 series printer. It really helps to be able to see the picture before you take it. The size of the camera is nice, too. It's easy to carry."
1,a chain is only as strong as its weakest link,"After reading many customer reviews (mostly 4 stars and better) and researching dozens of other cameras, I ordered the D460, convinced I had made the best decision for the dollars spent. I've had it for about an hour and it is back in the box ready to send back. The second time I lifted the flash attachment, a small steel ball bearing fell out and the attachment would not lock into place, nor would the flash function when I attempted to test it. The flash is like something you find on a toy camera! As to the camera's other features, I can offer no opinion. I didn't get that far!"
2,my first digital camera,"brought the d460 to replace a 35mm camera. By the time I figured out how to use it properly, I was steadily getting very dissapointed with the digital zoom. When you are in an auditorium, taking pictures of your children performing, you cannot get a good close-up. Picture quality is great as long as you are taking stills, scenary, and no action. I've had it for about 3 years and I'm making a better choice next time."
1,You get 'hosed' on the batteries,"Nice, easy to use. BUT you will never be able to find replacement batteries (lithium). I had to call Olympus direct. They want $13.95 each BUT almost $8 for S&H!! If I knew this, I never would have bought the camera. Don't make the same mistake!"
4,PC/Mac connectivity,"Everything about his camera is good, not least of all the best lens cover available which is important in a camera that gets bounced around. However, be sure to check the documentation (which in earlier versions has been inadequate) and whether this model provides USB connectivity (earlier versions did not and required a reader and adaptor)."
4,Great Digital Camera,"This is my first digital camera. I have had it and used it extensively since August of 2001. Sharp pictures, good color. Downloads are slow - perhaps this is a digital camera characteristic - I don't know. I bought a larger storage card for it and it works really well. I am buying a replacement and hope to find something that works as well with the movie and sound feature. No reservations in recommending this camera."
4,Great camera!,"This is an outstanding digital camera - you will not be dissapointed!Strengths: *Excellent picture quality *Intuitive user interface and menus *Can use as point & shoot, or can tweak options like ISO and flash speed for more advanced use *Included Smart Card holds from 32-122 imagesWeaknesses: *Serial port download of images is super-slow (although getting the USB smart card reader via rebate will solve that problem) *No AC adapter or rechargable batteries included"
2,Customer Service for this camera is lees than desirable,While the camera is performing great! There were some accessories that did not work with the camera. I tried repeatedly to contact Olympus and received the runaround on numerous occasions. I will not buy an Olympus product again. Customer service and support is the focal point of any good business. The marketers at Olympus obviously missed that day of instruction when they were going through customer support training.
4,Don't leave home without it,"I take it everywhere. Only complaint is the slow reaction time when hitting shutter release, but all in all it is a great point and shoot digital camera. After a couple of years of frequent use it works just as good as the day I bought it."
4,Love at First Sight But I'd Like Some Accessories,"I must say I'm pretty happy with the Olympus 460 Zoom. I originally was going to buy the 360, but I figured if I was going to spend the money for a digital camera, I might as well get the zoom.With the 460 comes some advanced photography features like spot metering, fill-in flash, etc. Those features may seem useless to amateur photographers, but if you take the time to learn the features, you'll end up with better pictures.The TV wire is pretty cool, and even the pictures with the lowest quality look pretty good on TV.The LCD screen on the camera is very sharp and has amazing color. I just wish there was some way to cover the screen to protect it better.A downside to the Olympus is that it doesn't come with a lot of accessories. I'm going to have to buy stuff like a camera case, battery recharger, USB adapter, and a 32 MB card. ...."
5,Great camera for beginners,This is definitely an all in 1 solution for a digital camera. Featuring 1.3 MP it definitely gives real professional quality shots. Even in pitch darkness the camera with the flash gives amazing pictures. Further the panoramic feature is also wonderful. The only downside of this camera is the manual lens cover. Anyway this is a must buy for serious starters with digital camera !!
5,Great Camera for the First Timer,This is my first digital camera and I could not be happier. I can't say enough about the camera's performance and the quality of the pictures. This camera is great and the price was terrific.
4,4.5 out of 5,One of the best camerias that are super! I say buy it. Yes the amazon prediction is correct. a 4.5. HAve the cash than buy it
3,Take these reviews with a grain of salt,"D460Z is very unlike the 450Z and it is made of cheap plastic. Ofcourse, the menu has improved but the overall quality has declined. I noticed the following:1. Camera body is made of cheap plastic 2. The zoom lens makes an annoying noise when you turn the camera on! 3. Price is falling down like a rock...."
5,Great Digital Simple to Use,Pretty much point and shoot. Even had it used at my daughters wedding and it took better shots compared to 35mm Nikons FG. I'm happy with it and take it everywhere. For the price its hard to beat. I find the flash a little awkward but i'm getting use to it. Great starter digital! Definetly a good deal.
5,"Excellent Camera, Easy to Use !!!","I'm pretty satisfied with this camera. I originally was going to buy the 360, but I switched to this one because it includes the zoomThe Olympus D-460L is very easy to use, and produces great shots even in normal quality. Battery's life is OK for me.Perhaps the only complaint is that it doesn't include a purse that allows to protect it"
5,Great camera!,"The Olympus D460 is really awesome. I have owned a few of these types of cameras already, from the ""early days"" of digital photography and onward. This camera is really refined, they cleaned up alot of earlier mistakes and made the whole experience a pleasure. I very highly recommend digital photography and this camera in particular. Meanwhile, Yahoo has set up a service to upload these pictures and have them printed on photo paper. All in all, you can't miss."
5,Great Book !!! Better than Rosetta,"I found the book to be highly useful with the proper dialects and prononciations of the words. Keep in mind that language has three to four different dialects and this book has the main one that is used in Khandahar province. The book is also used by the military and teaches a great deal of the fundamentals to be knowledgeable of. I have tested Rosetta and compared the two books/software and this by far beats the competition due to price and straight forward lessons. If your planning to visit the country or learn the language, I highly recommend. Cheers!"
5,S is for Star Alphabet,"This book is full of information for the mature reader. There is a simplied version printed just above the more indepth description for the very young who are just learning to read. The writer of this colorful book has ""done her homework"" to find a meaning for each letter of the alphabet! ""S is for Star"" teaches readers of all ages many interesting facts. The artwork is colorful and hold everyone's attention! For the young child, the book is not too long. There are so many facts to read about that it will take more time for the mature reader to finish reading it in a timely manner. I highly recommend buying this wonderful book for all ages!"
4,nice for an older child,"This book is very informative and would be wonderful to read one letter each day leading up to christmas with a school age child. I bought this book for my 7 month old nephew and while it is nicely illustrated, I don't think it will hold his attention very well as it is much better suited to an older child. I would not suggest this book for children under 5, simply because of the reading level."
4,Why buy this set?,"I've seen the show a few times on HBO and found it interesting enough to want to buy it and watch the whole thing. What I cannot figure out, however, is why anyone would pay a $30 premium to buy this versus buying each season separately for roughly $40 each. You won't be disappointed by the series but save your money by buying them separately or during a sale."
1,DON'T BUY! The individual seasons are much cheaper.,"THE WIRE is a great show, although it probably peaked in itssecond season. But don't buy this package. The individualseasons are available for $27.50 each, for a total of $110,far cheaper than this combo."
1,The Wire Seasons 1-4,"The DVDs were impossible to watch! They were given as a Christmas gift, and the recipient has already requested my receipt so that they could be returned. If there is any way you can facilitate the return, I would greatly appreciate it.Thank You,Dr. Barry Sternfeld"
5,On The Wire,"This is some of the best television you'll ever see. I've been a fan of David Simon since the days of ""Homicide: Life on the Street,"" and ""The Wire"" is ""Homicide"" taken to the next level. As with ""Homicide,"" the writing is first-rate, the characters are rich and the story lines are compelling. ""The Wire"" is gritty, it's raw, and it's real. It grabs you and holds you and it's truly must-see TV."
4,The Wire 1-4,"Seeing all the first four seasons of 'The Wire' together is both an exhilarating and depressing experience. Superbly plotted and written with characters as good as only American character actors allowed to settle into their roles can be, it nevertheless paints the most hopeless picture of urban decay, the drug culture in ever-younger children, the hopelessness of inadequate city and state funding and the powerlessness, and sometimes venality, of its politicians and city officials. It's mesmerising viewing, each episode augmenting and deepening the others, which is truly admirable given the multiplicity of writers and directors. Quite why the City of Baltimore ever allowed it to be filmed, let alone co-operated in the filming, one cannot imagine. It's as though Coca-Cola ran a national campaign that said ""Don't ever, under any circumstances, drink Coke"""
1,VERY disappointing!,"This CD is VERY disappointing. To give you some idea of how much of a let down this CD is, I've tried to sell it at used CD stores, but they won't buy it because too many other people have tried to do the same!"
3,Works but AWFUL TASTE that lingers,"Ok the only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because I'm sure it works just like any other Listerine. That said, this is the worst flavored mouthwash I have ever had in my life. I can't begin to explain the bizarre aftertaste this leaves in your mouth...it literally tastes like you just put sewer antiseptic stuff in your mouth. I've had many many many kinds of mouthwashes, please believe me when I say this is the most awful tasting one I have EVER encountered. I drank water and coke but the taste still lingers after 10 minutes, it would probably be a lot longer if I didn't drink the soda. I'm debating just tossing this entire bottle because it's so bad. Avoid this version of Listerine at all costs unless you are trying to punish whoever has to use this awful stuff."
5,The Best!,"This one is the strongest and I've used it for years! if you can get use to it, it will do the job way better than even other Listerines!This commercial is true fact: [...]"
2,taste bad,"This mouthwash is too strong, burns mouth, no taste. My son uses it and it has the same effect.Try other flavors instead."
1,beware of shipping costs,"I was not paying much attention when I ordered this, but with shipping it cost me $26. This is more than a liter of whiskey costs. So be careful of shipping."
4,Excellent inspection morror,"I use this mirror on a daily basis and have been using the same one for several years. I recently dropped it about 10 feet onto a tile floor and cracked the mirror so it's time to get another (no fault of the mirror). This is an excellent, large diameter mirror which is ideal for inspections and is large enough to allow taking photographs of the item being inspected. The ball coupler, which allows the head to articulate is tension adjustable. Unlike the previous reviewer, I have never had any issue with inadequate tension at the joint. If I could change one thing about this mirror, I would add about two more telescopic sections to the handle to allow for longer reach. Because of the large head size, this is not the mirror to use in tight spaces."
1,Nice Junk,"The various components are good quality: Clear, large mirror and well fitted stainless telescopic sections with good foam rubber handle. The problem is that the mirror is too heavy for the ball joint. The mirror sags and does not stay in position. Junk."
3,THE voice of pop.,"I've been a big fan of Jones ever since I saw (and heard) him do the ""Imagine/From A Distance""-medley, on British TV some years back. -He just blew me away !. No other male singer impresses me more, I can assure you. Now, we all know he's great on jazz tunes, but I've always prefered the more poppy stuff, no doubt because of that medley. This album has some good songs on it, like the title track, and the Steve Perry cover. I just wish he'd do more albums like this one (and a new x-mas album.) His voice is absolutely perfect for this type of pop music. One of my other favorite singers is Alice Cooper, and before you break out in laughter, I actually think there are similarities. Contrary to common belief, Alice can actually sing beautifully, and be quite a balladeer when he wants to. -That's when the two remind me of each other, with their great voices. Jack did a Richard Marx ballad recently; surely one of Coop's would work, too. How about it, Jack ?."
5,"Jack Jones: ""I Am A Singer""","And Jack Jones, one of America's greatest singers, certainly IS!! This CD to me is riveting evidence of avocalist who I believe is a bridge between the consummate artistry of Frank Sinatra and the Jazz saavy ofMel Torme. Sounding neither like those giants of vocal interpretations, Jack Jones takes balladeering tothe very fringes of Jazz vocalization. This is especially evident in his renditions of ""You've Changed""arranged with ""Round Midnight"". Going from Billy Joel (""Tender Moment"") to Thelonius Monk to his owndelightful composition and feel on ""Rio"", Jack Jones displays a masterful craftsmanship and playfulness that always comes directlyfrom his heart to yours. This is a perfect CD which captures the many moods and textures of a maturedJack Jones, and should be part of any listeners' catalog of vocalists---as an absolute must!Fred Farell, Gospel Jazz Vocalist"
1,Unacceptable poor quality,"It only worked for a week before it broke. The same malfunction that we had with the 'Baby' Leap-pad. When you insert a correct 'My first LeapPad' cartridge, the unit beeps and says ""this is not a Leapfrog cartridge"".The Leapfrog products are JUNK.... don't buy it. I made the mistake twice to buy Leapfrog products. Their products appeal more to the parents than to the kids and the quality is unacceptable."
2,Great idea...lots of bugs,"I bought this for my son's 3rd birthday, as it's rated for 3-5 years. It's a great idea, but there were quirks from the beginning that bothered me and made it difficult for a 3-year-old to use it. Like when you press the ""on"" button, there's about a two or three-second delay before it powers on and makes its first sound. So kids (including my 4-year-old daughter) think it didn't come on the first time. So they press it again, which shuts it off. My son did enjoy using it once he got the hang of turning it on. His favorite way to play was with the alphabet games minus any book. But within about a year, it started to think you had a book in at all times. My two younger children are now old enough to play with it, but it constantly prompts them to point to items that are on pages other than the one they're on, even when pressing the green ""go"" cirle. I purchased this brand new three years ago, but it had a different look. Hopefully the newer version has worked these bugs out."
2,3yo bored in 5min,"My 3yo, who loves his vtech whiz kid, was bored with this in no time. The dialogue moves very slow and the story lines are very basic. The child must click ""go"" on each page in order to activate it, very redundant. Once on a page, and they click go, they must choose a game a t the bottom of the page, after what seems like 10seconds, it spits out ""find the red square"", etc.. very boring. If your child knows his colors and shapes, they will not find this too challenging - aka boring. I think the whiz kid is a much better product. Hopefully he will like some of the other books for this, otherwise its going back."
1,Beware! Leapfrog's custome service has gone way downhill!,"My daughter likes her My First Leappad, but after several months use, the pen has wires showing! I called Leapfrog and after a series of frustrating phone calls, I find out that they don't make the replacement pen for the My First Leappad anymore! At first the customer service agent told me they have the pen and I paid for it. The package I recieved in the mail had an old leappad system that doesn't work and 2 pens that don't fit my leappad. When I called back, it was a 2 hour ordeal. Finally, I spoke with a supervisor who told me that despite the fact that it was their mistake, I had to pay to ship everything back to them, then they would refund my money! Not only am I upset by this treatment, but I can't believe they don't make the pens anymore. I have invested in a lot of books for this leappad and now it is useless. What a waste of money! I cannot in good conscience buy from LeapFrog again!"
3,cheap leappad,"This was a great toy to get him(2 year old) excited about reading. However the quality is terrible. Bought it for christmas last year and only worked right for 9 monthes. After trying to fix the leap pad myself I gave up and figured that I would just by a new one(the next model). But at this point, since we won't be able to use the cartridges that we already have, I think I'll try a vtech instead. He's gonna miss it though."
4,Great for the price,I got this toy to keep my child entertained on an airplane and it worked great. The pen response and books are a lot of fun. It looks like a keeper!
3,"Ok for a start, but malfunctioned in 10 months","This was a gift for Christmas that only lasted 10 months. Some of the activities kept my son entertained, but I can see why so many people recommend to just buy the regular Leappad. There was not a lot involved in the activities, and most of it my son already knew. The reason I gave it 3 stars is the lack of education it provided and the fact that it broke. The batteries started to die, because it would start to talk slow then turn off. Then after changing the batteries it wouldn't work and kept saying the batteries needed to be changed, after I already put in fresh new batteries twice. It was fun to see my son get some use out of it while it lasted, but I wouldn't suggest buying this unless your child is still working on the basics (letters, numbers, shapes and colors)."
3,Old school leap but worth it,"Cons first:The books easily fall off the two pegs that hold them on thereThe volume can't be controlledOne of my kids has this ""thing"" for buttons and it is likely that the button to turn it off and on will be busted down within a few weeksPros:Teaches kids true respect for ""real books"" because they are most like a real bookSelf-motivating. One of my kids is totally addicted to messing around with this.Helps with fine and gross motor skills which is why I got it.I really like this which is why I bought it and a few of the books. I have the Tag system which is great. I have the Leapster system on the Wish List.I'd rather read to them but at the same token, when I am cooking, or doing dishes if they want to ""read"" (they are 20 mos old) this is what they run to right now along with ""real books"". With ""real books"" they look at the pics but can't read yet. This device actually helps them w/the gross and fine motor skills when using so I am ok w/that."
4,Polder dish rack review,"I purchased this item for the limited space available near my kitchen sink. It has worked very well for me. My only complaint would be that the silverware holder could drip inside the base tray unit. Occasionally the drain holes allow water to drip onto the counter. Otherwise, this item is very sturdy, and provides plenty of space for drying my dishes. It also looks nice too."
4,gets the job done,"I got this item because out of most products in this price range, it had the best reviews. It does what it's supposed to. I won't give it 5 stars because: on the utensil-holding attachment, the holes don't let it drain on it's own because they're too high up, and also there's constantly a little bit of water that drips down the tray, and goes underneath, so I have to pick it up and dry the bottom off, otherwise it never dries."
2,Big disappointment,"i am a bit disappointed with this video because most of the variations are recycled/already been taught by her other cassettes with minature changes. nothing new to be learned from this video.and this dancer instructure alvaro coronel is not manly at all, he doesn't have any style when he dances, and although he tries to copy pedro otero's style, yet he doesn't succeed.if you don't have any other tapes of her, then i guess you could purchase this video.the video is too short(45 min) and doesn't include many different variations.in conclusion, this video isn't worth it's price.johnny"
5,Expensive,Just a short note on these staples. You can buy them for half the price at Home Depot. I paid $9.50 for a box of 1000.
3,CANNOT BE USED ON PRESSURE TREATED WOOD,This is not explained in the details but is written on the box. Monel staples are not to be used on pressure treated wood. It then states that the staples will corrode if used on that type of wood. Looks like I'm going back to stainless and this overpriced box is being shipped back to Amazon.
4,Great Product but don't buy online!!!,"The product is exactly what I expected, staples. The problem is that all four boxes I received (2 ea on two seperate orders) were broken. The staples must have been handled rough becaues there was not even one complete row of staples that was still intact, it made it harder to get them in the staple gun when they are in small pieces. In addition, these are very, very expensive staples and I hated to throw away the many singles that had come off due to the rough handling.Bottom line, buy them from a hardware store where you can inspect them first to make sure they are not broken."
5,arrow fastener,This was just what I wanted and needed to set up an outdoor umbrella I was re-covering. The product was perfect and I have completed the job to everyone's satisfaction.Thank you for the prompt service.
2,Not popular at our house,"We love the monkey song so I was excited to find the book, but my daughter and I don't really care for it. The artwork isn't very appealing. Maybe she'll like it as she gets older but it is a dud at 14 months."
1,Disappointed,I can't exactly give a review for this product as I never recieved it in the mail. I put the order in on May 18th as and of today (June 22) I still have received the product and no one has been of any help regarding this. I will never order from this book seller again.
3,"Look out it's a ""big book.""","It doesn't say anywhere that I can see in the description that this is a big book suited for primary grade teachers yet not easy to hold baby on your lap and read. I had no idea when I put it on my wish list. What a surprise! It's a great story with illustrations that provide many teachable opportunities: number recognition, counting cause and effect, telling time, feelings, and more."
2,"Not in ""good"" used condition","Used books are a great idea.....but this one was in ""fair"" (at best) condition. It's a board book, but it's dirty (especially the cover) and quite worn....a bit tattered. Still functional for my little guy, but not as advertised. Arrived quickly!"
1,I did not get the CD Audio,I did not get the CD.and this was a present and did not have time to return it. It would have been a great gift if all had come with the order that I paid for.
5,"Prompt service, arrived on time, thank you",I ordered as a baby shower gift and it arrived on time.The recipent was very happy with the book. Thank you very much.
3,OK,This book is okay but not one of the best version of ten little monkeys that I have read. Each page is the same wording except for the number.
3,Book,"This is a great read for my daughter, I do wish it was bigger since she is 5. But the monkeys on the bed is a household favorite!!"
2,Monkies,"This book has cute, colorful pictures, however I have it on a Kindle fire Hd and the page is to small to enjoy! It could be user error on my part, I do not know for sure. Update... it is not an audio book for any kindle product per the maker!"
3,"typical old movie acting and special effects, but the message and history is still very valid!","Buy the more modern version from the 'bible collection', it is much better in every way, and more Biblically accurate."
2,Not so good...,Poorly dubbed and hard to follow. The thing is I recognize some of these guys from other Biblical epics and they're dubbed with their own voices... but they STILL don't quite match. What's up with THAT?
3,Not the most accurate film,"The acting and imagery is very good, considering the year it was made. My only complaint is that it's not biblically correct. The David potrayed in this movie started out as someone who was bitter towards God because the woman David loved was struck dead by lightning. There were other events that were in complete contrary to the Bible, like David going into Jerusalem immediately after being annointed by Samuel and knocking off a guard, etc. I think Samuel quoted from Proverbs, too, which was not supposed to have been written yet, since Solomon wasn't even born yet at the time.It's a good movie, but read the Bible if you want the real story."
1,"David and Goliath, Orson Wells as Saul.","Released as David And Goliath, this is a very enjoyable classic Bible story. On the cover it is billed as an Orson Wells picture, however, Wells does not take the prominent focus. This movie explores the opposite side of the Philistenes gearing up for war against Israel, an aspect not usually covered in Bible stories. If you like classic film, this is definitely one that should be seen."
1,Not Good!,"I have to agree with Awful and Very Dull!I don't think the man who produced this movie, ever read the true Bible story of David and Goliath. Good movie if U want to just sit and watch an old movie with popcorn, for a past time."
1,This is a maliciously mutilated copy,"Aside from any other problems, this version of the film is butchered to ribbons. Originally released at an hour and 53 minutes, this disc contains only an houord and 35 minutes. The visual aspect of 2.35:1 has been mutilated to 1.33:1. It's hard to believe the amount of irresponsible greed behind this wanton violence. May its perpetrators suffer the fate of old nitrate film left out in the sun."
3,Good to watch,"It is well perform, but has many discrepancies regarding the truth of the Bible. Otherwise to replace other movies that do not bring moral and faithfulness to someone it is good, as entertainment."
1,Awful,"This movie was just awful. I really can't believe that I spent the time I did to watch it. The acting was awful, the sound was awful, the dialogue, direction, everything was just awful. I couldn't find anything that I liked in this whole movie. I can't even believe that this was a movie with Orson Welles in it. He was awful.Not a movie I would recommend. Instead watch King David, with Richard Gere, or the Bible Collection's David. Much better than this mess."
3,About the pain and joy of living...often seen together in a melancholy unity,"The title of ""Gala""'s first track, ""Sweetness and Light"", is sneakily deceptive, as Lush never were so shallow as to sink into power-pop territory, and thank God their aims were never blatantly commercial because we might never have gotten music so complicatedly uncalculating. The best of the 15 tracks (both versions of ""Scarlet"" and ""Thoughtforms"", the hushed ""Sunbathing"", the brilliant ""Hey Hey Helen"") are underscored by a sadness that is never worked out (it's like a musical residue), yet the conception of the songs is far from morose. Lush terrifically energizes their soundscapes with a dreamy poppiness that is winning and still complex, and the songs here tend to change with the listener's mood, like a mood-ring you come across and never want to let go of. B+"
5,Great mood,"I just recently re-discovered this album. Completely off of my general music listening radar - rock to classical to jambands. Want to complete your musical circle? Give any of their albums a shot.I also believe it was this album that, when played at the same time as the video, ""Beyond the Mind's Eye"", tracked virtually perfectly. Ahh those were the days. Needless to say, it can be enjoyed in any state of mind."
2,Slow Moving Fantasy for Young Readers,I found the book difficult to finish because there is very little action or humour. It is told from a woman's perspective and the story never moves beyond the predictable. There is no thief or trickster amongst the companions to add colour to the story. I would categorize this as a young adult book that should appeal to young women interested in fantasy. It is not a stand-alone book and I will not be purchasing the second book.
4,Mystic and Rider,I enjoyed all the books in Sharon Shinn's Twelve Houses series. They are all fun and a mix of fantasy and romance.
2,BORING!,I was very disappointed in this book and could not finish it. Shinn's angel books are so much better.
1,Just couldn't get into it,"So I quit reading. Am I too impatient, too childish that I want all the monsters and magic, good old-fashioned stuff, that made me fall in love with fantasy in the first place? Frankly, I don't even remember what this was about, I just know that I was bored and I quit reading. SO. Don't invest your hard-earned bucks, okay? It's sortof like dating, you know? Let's face it, it's a crap shoot. You're hoping for total fascination with a touch of yummy and you get a blah blah with a glop of cheez-whiz. Thank God it's Friday, I think I'm cranky."
5,One of the best books I have read in a while,"I have always found Sharon Shinn to be a writer of unreliable quality. Some of her books have been quite enjoyable and others have been eye-rollingly silly. I really enjoyed Mystic and Rider, and found it to be one of the most interesting reads I have had in a while.The caveat to this is that I am extremely character driven- as a life long fantasy/sci-fi reader I find that for the most part the plots have all been explored to a certain extent, what sets a novel apart is the characters. And I found the characters in M&R; to be very interesting and engaging. Senneth was a wonderful character set in a team of engaging and interesting people that really made the story come alive. You could really see their development as they went though their adventures through the lands together.Very entertaining read with adventure and a lovely romantic subplot that wasn't silly or overdone. You will enjoy the hours spent reading this."
3,Here's the track listing...and it's a bit disappointing,"Well, the American maxi is out...and missing a load of mixes from the double vinyl. You'll have to resort to a few of the import singles to fill some of that gap, but some of the vinyl mixes are currently not available on any of the CD singles. On the bright side, a couple of non-vinyl mixes appear here...although, they're short versions. here's the line up:1. video mix (3:44)2. trak starz remix (3:31)3. gabriel & dresden club mix (8:51)4. peter rauhofer radio edit (3:43)5. mad brit mixshow (5:55)6. bloodshy & avant dubbie style remix (5:15)7. kanye west remix (3:43)Barely a half hour of music on a whole CD. Bummer."
3,Unfortunately Mediocrity,"Yes, I said it. I found this album to be mediocre. Joe Sample is reknowned for his style, composition, and music to relax, move, or whatever his music leads the listener to do. But for some odd reason, this is an album that lack spirit. It seems to fall flat for some unknown reason. It's something that I can't seem to get into, to this day. It's not like how I feel about Norah Jones (soporific unless you hear it on a rainy day), I cannot get into this album, even after the years in which I had it. It has it's moments every now and then (""Phoenix"" is one track that I listen to quite often) but for the most part it misses the soul the Sample is known best for."
5,Great cd...beautiful music..Joe Sample The great!!!,"Joe Sample is a great pianist and demonstrates in this magnificent production of Tommy LiPuma where, accompanied by extraordinary musicians as Marcus Miller, Omar Hakkim, Lenny castro, Michael Landau among others, gives us this beautiful collection of jazz themes combined with the rhythm and 'funky' where the characteristic sound and style of Sample is felt. Two thumbs up!"
5,"""The Icon of pianist""","Since I was eight years old I have been a lover of the stylings and artistry of Joe Sample,my father would play one of many eight tracks in his collection of ""Sample"" wizardry and I can remember asking him who was that,he said just the greatest pianist of our time,and that still lives true today,from his redition of one the classics like ""Fever"" to his own stylings of a few of my favorites like ""Ashes To Ashes"" and ""Strike Two"" I can go on and on about the ""Gauge for all other pianist to measure themselves by""."
5,Joe Sample has a CLASSIC here!,"Beautiful piano from ex-Crusader, and the rhythm section (led by Marcus Miller) creates a fresh sound for Joe.Check out the bass and guitar on 'Mother's Eyes'."
5,Geat Fun!,"I've used nearly every song on this fab CD in my weekly music classes! Singable, easy to teach & learn. 'Gotta Get the Beat' is a great way to practice steady beat w/instruments; and what kid doesn't always want to'Hop Skip & Jump'? Great musical arrangements as well."
4,An excellent follow up to their debut album,"If you like Information Society's first album, you will also like this one. Lots of catchy tunes, especially ""Think"" and ""How Long"". My only gripe about this album is the filler nonsense in between the actual songs. These stain an otherwise excellent album."
2,"Like the techno, lose the new wave","Unfortunately most of the songs these guys do are in that Duran Duran new wave genre. Personally, I'd say the vocals are ok but others like Spandau Ballet are far more talented. But a couple tunes like Hack1 are really cool and innovative. If they'd just do albums with that style alone, I'd kick out the greenbacks."
4,Unique little cat toy.,"I purchased this for my 8 week old kitten who is still in his chewing-on-everything phase. The interesting thing is when I put it on the floor my six year old Persian snapped it right up and began chewing on it and tossing it up in the air. So far the baby hasn't shown any interest in it, but my older guy loves it. Guess this is more of a personal preference type toy than an age oriented one. Well made and colorful."
4,Sweet Music From The Soul,"For the musician, performance is a mirror to their soul. In her recordings and her live performances, Dr. Suman Sharma reveals a sweet simplicity that is evident in her personality and is a joy to hear in her playing. This music floats like a gentle breeze across the mind of the listener. It is settling, serene and indeed a joy to hear. She is masterfully supported in her playing by world-renowned tabla artist Anup Ghosh."
3,Gencer not at her best!,Leyla Gencer is a great primadonna with beautiful voice and astonishing technic. However this recital it isn't one of her best. 'Keep' the Bartoc songs.
3,Accomplished but lacks something,"Paul Simon, Jackson Browne and the Gipsy Kings all contributed to this 30th anniversary album. Speaking Of Dreams kicks off with two of her own compositions, the protest song China which deals with the Tiananmen Square massacre, followed by Warriors of the Sun with its bouncy reggae rhythm.I did not find Carrickfergus very satisfying although the guitars are lovely, neither do I enjoy Hand To Mouth at all. The graceful title track, another own composition, reminds me of her earlier song Gulf Winds in its confessional nature. Jackson Browne sings along on El Salvador, a typical Baez protest song, but it doesn't sound so convincing here.The collaboration with Paul Simon - Rambler Gambler, has a happy South African rhythm and is altogether more inspiring. The album concludes with the more traditional folk number Fairfax County. An interesting blend, but not always successful. This is not an altogether bad album, I just don't think that most of the material suits her."
3,Mediocre Joan Baez,"This is an ok CD. I like some of the songs, such as China and El Salvador, but some of the others I don't like so much. I like fast moving songs, so that's why I like El Salvador and China. If you are going to buy a Joan Baez CD, get a different one, such as Classics Volume 8. Also, if you like Joan Baez's faster songs, you might like a Nanci Griffith album, or for other folk type music, try Cheryl Wheeler."
1,Total waste of money.,"I was trying to tape off a square on my jetski, then paint it with krylon paint. The surface was smooth sanded, cleaned with paint prep, then taped. Proper preperation is key with painting. The paint laid out awesome, perfect three layers. The next night after waiting 24hrs. , the tape was ready to pul, as a peeled it up instantly i became furious as i realized the paint had bled under the tape. Total garbage in my opinion!"
2,"Paint Bleeds, Rough Edges and Tears on an angle.","Very disappointed with this tape. I just painted a room and the tape left a rough edge not a clean line as I was expecting. 3M says this will leave a Sharp Line but I have never seen that, I always see a rough edge. The bigger problem is that I taped along an edge where the tile meets the wall and apparently the tape didn't stick real well as the paint bled underneath in spots and onto the tile/wall interface. Now I have to go back and either scrape the paint off or caulk over it. And this is supposed to be a Multi-Surface tape. I could have done a better job using a wet rag (it was latex paint) and just wiping any spots where there shouldn't have been paint.I would not recommend this tape and I have been painting for over 40 years and have used many different tapes and this is one that I regret using."
2,old stock,The tape arrived and it appears that it was older tape stock.Kind of dry and not the freshest tape stock. I was kinda pissed.
2,not impressed,"This tape was sold at a good price so I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, it has that nasty habit of tearing length-wise as I try to pull it off the roll. I guess the adhesive is too strong for the paper. Next time I'll spring for the expensive green tape."
4,Good Tape,First the good:Tape applies easily and paint does not bleed through it.The Bad:Tape must be taken off very slowly or it tears and in some places has taken paint with it.
2,Track List (S21-17581),1. A Little Bit of Soap2. Come On Girl3. The Way You Look Tonight4. Little Lovely One5. Gee Oh Gosh6. Why Am I A Fool For You7. One By One8. She Loves To Dance9. Red Sails In The Sunset10. Little Bug
4,black and white polka dot napkins,"These napkins were very nice, ample in size and a good buy, I think for the price. The fabric was a little stiff, which I'm sure will correct itself by washing the sizing out. The recipient of these napkins loved them."
3,75 cents each,"I want to minimize disposable paper usage. These are 100% cotton and wrinkled terribly after washing. The napkins were offwhite when they arrived so I didn't notice any difference in color after washing. I will use these but given a second chance, I would not have bought these and just stuck with the Croscill tablecloth and napkins set."
4,Lovely napkins,"But I hate ironing and they have to be ironed. It was to be expected, but I still hate it. When they come up with the wrinkle-free cotton napkin I'll give five stars."
5,These are great!,The fabric for these napkins is both sturdy and beautiful. I love them. :) We have other cloth napkins that are very thin. These are the ones I use for heavy duty meals. ;) In other words the sloppy ones. :)
4,No wrinkles here!,"I disagree with the previous reviewer that says that they wrinkle easy. Not if you pull them out of the dryer while still hot and flatten them out and fold them immediately! I have been very pleased with them! Good quality, simple, and can be used for elegant settings or more casual."
5,What a Surprise!,"I ordered these for a Mexican-themed party and was so surprised when they arrived! Much, much better than I'd expected. These are colorful, very large and suitable for any casual table. I ordered two sets and was so glad I got the extras..."
5,Should be a Classic...,"This CD truly should be a classic, every song is wonderful. At times it kind of reminds me of Lenny Kravitz meets Kings X, with a touch of Beatles and Sitar.For the price they are selling here, you can not go wrong with giving this one a chance. When they run out, it for sure will go up in value, being Out of Print, and really not that easy to find.Turn this band on to your friends and do them a favor... :)"
5,This is a GREAT CD!,"I got this free as a give-away during a contest and, while I was not into Ethnic-type music, I still listened to this (mostly I figured I would give it about 30 seconds and then shelve it). But WOW, this is a really good CD. It doesn't sound Ethnical at all. I listen to this CD (entirely) quite often. I'm truly puzzled why it didn't become more popular. I think it just had to be lack of promotion. Then to see that you can buy it NEW for what .15 cents??? Folks, buy it! You've got nothing to lose."
4,Too Expensive,"The card works great even though it is fragile. It is much higher priced than SD cards, but older cameras don't accept SD."
5,"Beautiful output, need more print templates","I have an HP Photosmart Premium printer that has a CD/DVD printing feature. Basically you select a template using their Essentials 3.5 software, put the CD/DVD in the plastic guide and stick it in the CD/DVD drawer and it prints beautiful disks. I have had zero problems with the media either in writing on them or printing on them. I just wish they had more variety of print templates. If someone has found a source for more templates for direct printing, please add a comment. It will be geratly appreciated.I write backups of my photos, music and videos and it prints great photos on the disks. I also purchased the more expensive glossy ones, but these seem to be so good for everyday use, I purchased 2 more spindles. I guess I'll keep the glossy ones for some special usage."
1,No bueno,"Like the other reviewers that had problems with these discs, I have had good luck with Verbatim in the past but, not with these. More than 50% of the discs were defective. If you want to make printable DVDs that are only going to be used for coasters or Christmas ornaments then these are a good bet. It must be something with the manufacturing facility in Taiwan.... never had this many bad discs in a single spindle. Avoid."
4,Verbatim Still The Best!,"Have used this product many times and have ordered more! I have used Verbatim DVD discs for years and I highly recommend them. Have tried all the major DVD disc brands and none come close to Verbatim! Would have given this product a five star review if there had been a printable hub on disc! Tried Americopy white inkjet disc with printable hub but video BURNING results very poor! See my review of Americopy DVD+R 8x, DL, printable disc."
1,bad discs,Purchased these because the label is blank/white. Unfortunately every disc I've burned from this spindle has run into playback errors on multiple DVD players. This never happened with my prior blank DVDs. I read some reviews talking about bad discs floating out there. I must have gotten one of the bad batches (aka coasters).
1,Ignore old reviews - newest Verbatim is garbage,"I fell for it again - I thought maybe if I got Taiwan instead of India made, the quality might be better - but it seems that all Verbatim products are no longer what they used to be from a few years ago.Burns below rated speed, with pauses and many errors. I highly doubt they are even using AZO dye anymore, they'd have to prove it to me to believe it - it's a completely different product.Stop buying Verbatim. I know I'm done with with them wasting my time and money."
3,Not too bad for the price.,"The main reasons that I purchased these disks was the price, which was under $18 for a spindle of 50 as opposed to $25 for a 25 pk and they are inkjet printable disks. Problem one with these disks is that I couldn't get them to burn at the 8x speed and was forced to lower the speed to 2x. After burning 10 or so disks in this manner I ran into 3 that wouldn't burn. Not bad for the price although I haven't used them all yet so can't say how the rest will work out. I can say that the burn quality is very good. With the inconsistency of my old Epson printer, it is hard to judge the print quality of the surface but it seems good enough for my purpose. On the whole I would buy these again when needed."
1,Not a great buy..,"So with all these five star ratings, I'm not sure If i got a bad batch or what, but the DVD's only had 4.3 not 4.7 GB."
1,Stay Away,These disks have caused me many DAYS worth of nightmares. Every single one of these disks I have burned have turned in to coasters. I un/re-installed applications and even replaced my DVD burner before figuring out that these disks are the problem. I have had good luck with Verbatim in the past but these disks SUCK. Will probably never buy Verbatim again.
4,The only printable 4.7 disks to use,"Avoid Memorex disks like the common cold! Available ubiquitously, which make these far superior Verbatim printable disks harder to find. Amazon offers a fair price for them. Good bargain."
5,The best pacifier keeper ever!!!,"After having various pacifier keepers and trying them all, this is it!!! It stays on the baby/todler's clothes permanently even if they pull it hard. They don't hurt the baby's face/neck since they are soft plastic and small. They keep the pacifier in place and within reach."
4,Good Read,"This book is not about the T.V. show M*A*S*H. But the tv show did get many of its episodes from this book. From arterial transplants to make shift clamps these Doctors opened many new doors to the medical world. Chapter 6 ""In the O.R."" is pretty gruesome. Details of intestinal wounds abdominal wounds and pretty much everything a war could destroy on a body.But its not all blood and guts. D.R. Apel talks of the korean's who helped around the camp. The use of the white rocks in the compund. Plus his first day at the MASH was spent on his feet for 72 hrs. operating. Amazing.I would have ggave the book a five star rating but there was a section on a paper the D.R. wrote on arteral repair which IMO took away from the book. It might have worked better at the end of the book.Nice pictures of procedures and Korea. This book is a must for people who like the TV show and would really like to see what went on in a real MASH outfit during the real Korean war."
4,An Excellent Tribute to the M. A. S. H. Units in Korea.,"Dr. Appell's book ""M. A. S. H.: An Army Surgeon in Korea"" is an excellent tribute to the men and women of the Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals by a veteran surgeon of the 8076TH M . A. S. H. unit. My only complaint is that the book was not a little longer. For any fan of the movie or t. v. series this book is a must-read. Dr. Appell (who was a consultant for the series), tells us what life was really like in a M. A. S. H. unit. The series took some liberties with actual events, but its overall portrayal was fairly accurate-though the series lasted 10 years compared to the three years of the Korean War itself, and the average length of stay for surgeons in a M. A. S. H. was about 8 months. Dr. Appell has written a very interesting book."
4,GOOD BOOK,MY SON AND I ENJOYED READING THE STORIES THE MASHSERIES WAS BASSED ON . WE ARE BOTH FANS OF THE SHOW
1,boring,not the type of movie I like. just fast forwarded through. i wouldn't recommend it but it depends on your taste.
2,I wish I wasn&#65533;t there.,"To the point then! Been done been done been done, Very predictable from start to finish, Boorish, D grade in writing. Charlotte of course had a great voice at the time. But as of late we all know the voice is sinking slowly in the sunset."
4,Just a fun movie,"This is one of my ""makes me smile"" movies. The story is fun and the characters well cast. Charlotte Church's rendition of ""Summertime"" is absolutely memorable. There are quite a few little surprises in the film that keep it interesting. Unless you're Scottish, watch it with the subtitles to catch all the dialogue and punchlines."
4,Good movie,"I like this movie. If you like to hear Charlotte Church sing, this movie is for you. Joss Ackland is great as the grandfather."
4,richies' reveiw,this dvd movie with charlotte church is great has great story to tellabout family life the up and downs of it she is great in this movie so pick one up and enjoy itmy family did and are glad we did.
4,Low Key and Quirky,"This is a sweet film about awkward family relationships, music, recovery. The dialogue is full of subtle one liners and there is quite a bit of physical humor. The weak link in the cast is Charlot Church, aside from that I think everyone else hit the mark...especially Dolly the Llama, who I think beats out Tina as the best movie llama ever."
3,Good job for first time by Charlotte,"Charlotte Church fans should like seeing this movie, even if just to hear her sing some songs that are not on other albums. The movie has a nice story line, but could have been better written. We did enjoy it though, and would recommend it. Just keep expectations reasonable."
3,Not exactly what I expected.,No problem with Charlotte Church's singing in this movie. She has an incredible voice and there were a couple of numbers that were beautiful but overall the story line was not that enjoyable. Happy ending for the family but getting to it a bit difficult.
4,Sweet story...,"I was not expecting this to be such a sweet story... But it turned out to be just that. Not exactly Oscar material, but pretty good movie anyway.Leaves you with ""warm and fuzzies""."
3,Decent,"So to review the quality of this download, I think it is absolutely fantastic! HD, easy to download. It would be nice if the HD price was more like the standard definition price, but I suppose I can live with it. To just give a quick review of the season. I wasn't too impressed. Not one of Survivor's better seasons. I found it hard to get involved in the characters. Challenges weren't as fun. It seems like they've completely forgotten about the hidden idol. Well, hope next one will be better!"
5,Love it.,I love having the season available on my amazon instant video on my iphone. I can watch while I am in the airport waiting for my flight!
4,"Survivor, Season 24","I had to take this route to see the final outcome as I waited too long to view it over internet, nice way to view it commercial-free."
4,great introduction,this is an excellent introduction to the arab israeli conflicts summarizes everything beautiffuly dont miss the illustrations & photos
5,Amazon Purchased Item - Body Flex,"I had originally purchased Greer Childer's Body Flex work out DVD when I saw her program advertising weight loss from a chair. It sounded really odd at first, but I watched the program and was intrigued.I bought the DVD and workout bar. Within 6 months I had managed to lose 28 inches in all parts of my body. I was thrilled. I worked with the program for 5 years and managed to keep the inches and the weight off. Unfortunately, I lost the DVD. When I saw someone advertise the DVD (it was listed as VHS, but is actually the disc I wanted) on Amazon I had to buy it. It arrived in the mail very quickly. I have been using it sporadically since I received it. I have a shoulder that is messed up so I can't use it every day like I did in the past. However, I am still losing inches again and it feels really GOOD to know the same old exercise program still works for me, sitting in a chair!"
5,Body Flex,This is a perfect work out for me. The only downside is it only comes in VHS and we don't have a VHS player any more. I really enjoyed the workout. It's perfect for older people to keep their breathing good and exercise every part of the body at the same time. Really would like it on a DVD format!
2,The Norton version is better,I was extremely disappointed in this version. The translation by M. D. Herter Norton is much more eloquent. Save your money and buy that one instead.
3,A must read - but a tough slog,"This is an important book in literary history. It describes in ""ultra realism"" the rise of mass culture, the loss of individualism and personal value in 20th century Europe. It's told through the eyes of a failed artistand destitute nobleman arriving in Paris for treatment of some undisclosed mental illness. It contrasts with Kafka's surrealism, dealing with (basically) the same themes. So it's interesting and worth reading from those points alone. It's just that the language and plot are rather hyper emotional making the read a tough slog. But I'd still recommend the book for its pivotal position in literature and history."
4,glass drill,"These drills arrived as described. I used the larger of the drills and it did a fine job. I am new to drilling glass. I've heard that you should use turpentine as a coolant/lubricant. I didn't bother. The drilling went well, though there were some chips taken out of the initial side of the glass that I would have preferred not to have. Perhaps I need to learn more about the process. I'm satisfied, what can say about a glass drill? The price was right."
5,I wish more bands sounded like this.,Most current bands I hear are totally unimpressive and unimaginative. Clara Venus is a band that successfully blends a modern sound with the backbone of the best music I grew up with. Most power trios you hear today have forgotten music's melodic integrity; Clara Venus totally gets it man.
1,Deceptive advertising,"I ordered this product based on the advertised size of 3.3oz; instead the product came in a bottle of .5oz. Seller, should reimburse me for the cost of this misleading advertised product."
3,Definitely not for budget travellers,This book lists a great number of hotels in every corner of the country. Unfortunately it is geared for travellers who just need a place to sleep without being concerned with the cost. Hotels under 200FF/double are rarely listed.
3,Real life photo quality - not album friendly,"I'm a fan of HP photo printers and photo paper. There's no way you can tell if the photo was not developed at a kodak studio. Digital photography is here for real.I used this with HP PSC 1210 all-in-one (see my review there). Am more than satisfied with the results.However, there is a flip side to it. Photos printed on glossy paper tend to stick to the cover in some photo albums. If this happens to you, switch to matte finish paper."
4,Great compilation from his MCA years,"At the time of his MCA records period, Merle was becoming a singles artist, and his Lp's started to drift in quality.This cd, made back when there were hardly any other Merle cds, was a Godsend. Great music from start to finish.Please remember, when this cd came out, there were no fancy, collector's type compilations available. Those were years in the future. This is a straight ahead cd, the song listing is in the booklet along with who wrote them. Then there is an ad for other MCA artists who were lucky enough to have a recording on the then new Cd.Go ahead and get this if you can find it, you will love it!"
1,much better compilations available,"obtain these Capitol era songs from a different compilation (the other submitted review for this CD refers to an identically titled MCA collection)...to get a good quality, single-disc collection of the original recordings of some of Merle Haggard's greatest music, ""20 Greatest Hits"" on the Capitol/EMI label is good, as is the budget cd ""Best of the Best"" also on Capitol (avoid similarly titled releases on different labels)...to really do Merle Haggard's legacy justice, easily the best single purchase currently available is the multi-label box set compilation called ""Down Every Road"""
4,Lacking something,"The infamous Wilburys are back again, but the second outing is lacking something that made the first one great, Roy Orbison. I think his absence hurt the Wilburys, in their writing, playing, and overall performing. While the album is great, and is definitely worth the buy, it just does not compare to the first one."
1,CD is defective,"CD is the original ""Traveling Wilburys Volume 3"" with the addition of two bonus tracks. However,bonus track 13, ""Runaway"" has a ""dropout"", a silent gap, in both channels of the song. This occursat about twelve seconds into the song. I contacted the manufacturer, Rhino, who acknowledged the defectbut said there were no plans to replace the defective discs. They did however offer a refund if I sent the disc to them."
5,TOTALLY AWESOME !MUST BUY!,"I JUST RECENTLY PURCHASED A CD WITH VOL. I ( WHICH I HAD ON TAPE ALREADY) AND VOL. 3...OH! THIS IS EVEN MORE SUPERIOR THAN VOL. I, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS AN UNTOUCHABLE COMPILATION OF EXCELLENCE. DON'T HESITATE TO BUY THIS! EVERY SINGLE SONG IS RICHLY INTENSE...SHOWING A MATURITY AND NEAR GENIUS GROUP AT ITS PEAK!"
4,Do the Wilbury Twist,"This was the second Traveling Wilburys album, recorded after the death of Roy Orbison. The album suffers a little from his absence, but it's still a very good album. Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne sound like they are having a lot of fun here. Most of the songs have a lighthearted ""just for kicks"" feel to them, and it's cool to hear these guys just ""cut loose"" and do something different from their regular ""serious"" albums. Fans of these artists should really get a kick out of this."
3,too many Bobs,"It's hard not be influenced by Dylan. Harrison, Petty and Lynne certainly have been. That's not necessarily a fault, but how many Bobs do we need in one band? The three have been vocally flexible over the length of their careers, but around Bob, they become Bob. Orbison's death was a big loss for the TW's, both as the supreme singer that Roy was, and as the only member who obviously had no trace of Bob in his sound. I've heard Lynne do a great Roy. Perhaps he felt it wasn't right to do here and perhaps he's right, but more vocal variety among these four would make this a much better performance."
4,Why is this wonderful record out of print?,"I agree with most others that this album isn't as strong as Volume 1, but it's still quite good and I can't understand why its not available new. I was thinking maybe they have plans to rerelease it as an anthology, and this time their going to include Volume 2. Only a fantasy, but certainly a good one. Both Wilbury records are awesome! If you never heard them, but your fans of any of its members, buy this album."
1,What About Enron who Follwed This Book?,"The boys in the boardroom at ENRON literally owned and used this book to justify STEALING from so many people. People who were financially destroyed!Where was Richard Dawkins when the walls came tumbling down? NO WHERE!Do not be mislead: God is not one to be mocked. For whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap (cause and effect). Gal 6:7"
5,One of the books that one should keep forever,"It's as someone have already said in the comment, overwhelmingly striking, but that's not a reason for not giving it a full mark."
4,It's the real Deal,"Behavior is passed along in genes. Richard Dawkins, the evolution biologist, presents a good case and lots of evidence. The book gives the reader a unique perspective of how creature's behavioral patterns propagate and enhance survival. For pleasure reading I still prefer his ""God Delusion"", a masterful mixture of logic, incite, and research."
5,master work for any open minded person,"the book is a masterwork,It defacto changed some of the ways I look at things,the writing is good not over killing any-point but making them felt and each one count. (the points he is trying to make I mean).overall I would highly recommend this to anyone willing to use his brain and give it a chance.enjoydanny"
5,Excellent.,"I bought this book while I was on vacation in Florida; it kept me away from the beach, but made the trip so much better. This was my first real introduction to the theory of evolution by natural selection, it made me see the world in a whole new light. The selfish gene is an extraordinarily well written guide to evolution, I recommend it to everyone."
3,Poorly researched,"This book was very revolutionary when it was released. I can understand why--the prose is lucid, the ideas are presented in uncomplicated ways, and Dawkins panders to the reader's ego. However, there are major problems with the ways he presents information. While Dawkins gives an accurate description of evolutionary biology and comes up with the stellar idea of memes, the rest of the book is speculative and poorly-researched. Dawkins relies on pre-set ideas and notions that the reader(and Dawkins himself) might have to present difficult ideas. Some points of contention: Dawkins' ideas of women and men, Dawkins' ideas of animals, Dawkins presenting genes as 'selfish' and then believing that a short forward will help correct the misinformation, Dawkins' personal and dogmatic ideas that have no scientific backing whatsoever.This book should really be presented as Aristotle is: history preserved, a stepping stone to the path of truth."
2,A Waste of Time,"Nothing new - freely taken from George C. Williams's 1966 work ""Adaptation and Natural Selection."" I feel you are much better off reading Williams's origin paper and then reading Stephen Jay Gould's ""The Structure of Evolutionary Theory"" - at least the section on Dawkins - pages 614-656 where Gould discusses why and how ""Dawkins's argument collapses for many reasons..."""
1,"Disappointing, too many logical fallacies and inconsistencies","As a trained philosopher of science, I read the book owing to the recommendation of a friend working on biology and my own interests in updating my knowledge on theories of gene and evolutions.Dr. Dawkins has a compelling and persuasive style of writing that makes his book enjoyable to read. But his arguments are not always as tight as they appear to be. I find too many questions and problems with this book and can only bring out some essential ones here.First and foremost, it is not clear that what he describe as ""selfishness"" can be regarded and treated as ""biological"" features like the long"
2,The Selfish Gene - Convoluted and dense,"The Selfish Gene - Richard Dawkins. This is a treatise on natural selection at the gene or gene set level. I got it because I read his later book ""Genome: autobiography of a species"" and thought it fabulous - a better introduction to molecular biology /genetics /genomics than any text book available. This book was less. It was a fine academic work and, with some faults, rigorous and philosophically sound - but convoluted and dense. I think he established he knew the field in this book but did not become an Author until later. Unless you are a genetics groupie (and who isn't) skip this and buy and read Genome."
1,"Excellent book, terrible Kindle product","The one star is reserved not for Dawkins' superb seminal work on evolutionary biology, but for the terrible way it has been adapted for the Kindle. It's riddled with typos, and Dawkins endnotes - which he uses prodigiously as a tool to enrich his arguments and supplement his examples - are all but inaccessible. It's a great shame that such an important book has been ported to the Kindle platform in such a cavalier fashion."
5,Exceptional Book on Gene Selection,This book is typical Dawkins and as such is extremely well written and understandable by the intelligent layman. Secondly this book is not about selfish organisms it is about selfish genes which can actually have the effect of creating altruistic behavior in organisms. This edition contains extensive notes responding to criticisms and clarifying the original edition.I cannot recommend this book highly enough to anyone who wants to understand how evolution works at the gene level. Furthermore it is just an intellectual treat to be enjoyed.
4,good deal,"Good seller, on time delivery, and the item was as described in the description,I will buy from this seller again."
2,Specifically a review of the Kindle Edition,"Without going into the content of the book, which I find very good, the Kindle edition was poorly produced. It is littered with typos of the sort that look like it was simply run through OCR software and then the publisher called it a day. These are things like ""1"" being replaced with ""i"", ugly pixelated graphics for mathematical notation (even very simple stuff like """"), or commas being placed after rather than before the spaces separating clauses. Additionally, the endnotes aren't proper hyperlinks, and so navigating to them requires repeatedly setting and clearing bookmarks alternatively at your current point in the text and the section where the endnotes are.It's a shame that a book of such excellent writing quality received such poor production treatment for this new format."
4,Helpful perspective,"For a clear description of the way species opt for survivalat the genetic level, this book is concise and readable bynon-scientists!"
5,The best book I have ever read!!,"This book is simply amazing! It is beautifully written and well formulated. I love how Richard Dawkins argues for his theories. I have learned about evolution in school, but not this way! Here he explains why we behave like we do towards our relatives (and others), how this has been evolutionary beneficial. The parts I like the most must be the parts with game theory. Is it smart to cheat others in order to survive? If so, how much can you cheat before you get busted and is less likely to survive?Finally I have to say that this is clearly the best book of Richard Dawkins I have read so far, and I highly recommend it!! (I haven't read ""The Extended Phenotype"", but I will very soon)"
4,A good book perhaps spoiled by too much detail.,"I found the book hard to read, even though it has undergone several re-writes. I understand his main arguments, and agree with them, but it does suffer from a surplus of verbiage."
4,Great Writing!,"Richard Dawkins can make even fairly dry scientific material come up sparkling with interest. At times the long chemical or scientific names were a challenge, but he makes the story of how our physical heritage works both fascinating and readable. I found myself at times not even trying to pronounce the words but skipping along to see what came next.This is the most challenging of subjects and at times needing fairly close attention to the reasoning, but it's well worth the time spent to read carefully."
5,Engaging for an academic read,"In ""the Selfish Gene"" you have the product of a highly powerful mind in Dawkins.The book has become not only popular reading, but a go-to text in institutions of higher learning.Evolutionary concepts are broken down into detailed and viable theories, and relayed in nearly as accessible a manner as possible for what is pretty technical subject matter."
2,Can't believe I didn't like this one,"After reading two of Dawkins' other works (Blind Watchmaker and God Delusion), I really expected to love this book. It is, afterall, his ground breaking work, and it is held in such high praise.I could not put either of the other two Dawkin's books down. This one, though, I could barely pick up. I found the writing style choppy and hard to follow. I found the concepts interesting but jumbled by the writing. Unlike the other works, I found this one unaccessible to the everyday reader.If you want a more straightforward book on evolution, go with the Blind Watchmaker."
5,Off-kilter Classic!!!,"The album begins with a jangly, slightly ominous mid-tempo chord progresson and the words ""everyone wants to know a lonely death tonight, I'm leaving tonight..."" delivered with an elfin innocence. This sets the tone for this great album, maybe best described as sinister bubble-gum rock. Tons of great hooks, weird lyrics, and cool bass-guitar-drum textures abound. I don't know why this band was so overlooked. I'd put this album in a league with Neutral Milk Hotel and Guided By Voices, although they never followed up with anything substantial, and have seemingly disbanded."
1,Problems,"First off, the connector kept popping out in my bag and turning the thing on which then burned through the batteries.But I can't get it to work now even with a battery. I think it's of low quality and breaks easily.Not for me."
3,a little more than I wanted,Great book for those looking for details. Was hard to read. Would make a great text for a course on Louisiana politics.
2,"aircraft structural analysis, minus the aircraft","I went to ERAU where the main author teaches. He's an extremely smart person , but he's out of touch with reality and practicality. With that in mind, it's a very difficult book to read, not including the many errors in it. As far as ""aircraft"" structural analysis is concerned, this book covers extremely little. It's basically a generic structural analysis book with an airplane on the cover. If you want real aircraft structural analysis books, get Bruhn and Peery."
2,Outdated & Hard to Read,"The publisher (McGraw Hill) should release an errata or a new updated version due to the amount of errors that this textbook has. Author didn't do a good job explaining some of the materials, especially shear lag & virtual work; thus the book is quite difficult to understand & read. The next edition should provide more relevant examples, so students/readers would be able to do the homework problems without extensive aid of solution manual.Conclusion: An overpriced, outdated & difficult to read textbook. Save your money for something else."
1,Full of Mistakes,"This is an absolutely terrible book to try to learn from. Our professor has not given us the 81 pages of corrections, so we don't know if we can even look at the examples to try and model after them. It truly makes it impossible to learn when you can't even trust what you're learning from."
1,Looks Can Be Deceiving!,"First of all, I was prepared for the ring to be a lighter shade of blue than that pictured. I was warned by several other reviewers that the shade is less than would be expected, AND they were right on the money. The stones in this ring are barely blue, and really not very pretty. It looks cheap and I would agree with one other reviewer who stated that it would have been better to have 5 slightly larger stones instead of the 7 smaller ones. It spans too far across the finger and the sizing does seem to be slightly smaller than the size stated. Save your money for something better. Even at half price, which is what I paid, it was not worth the money."
3,ANSWERING DEVICE,Only records 45 seconds of caller.Digital recorder sometimes hard to understand.Easy to use & right for the price.
2,OUTHOUSE IN MOROCCO,"A RATHER LONG DRAWN OUT STORY, SOME BATTLE ACTION. LEGION IS HOLLYWOOD TYPE, NO LEGION MUSIC, A FEW LAUGHS FROM AKIM TAMIROFF. RAFT IS TO SERIOUS AND RATHER BORING. SAD ENDING JUST LIKE THE LEGION IN THE THE MOVIE."
3,Be careful,"This is the only available Freddie Hart collection available. And these are original recordings.The packaging is awful. Hardly any notes and no song info.My advice: Wait until a better, more classy collection is released."
5,"""Eaaaasssyy Lovin', so sexy lookin'...""","For the price this is an absolute must have for any true country fan out there! It is worth the price simply for ""Easy Lovin"" and ""My Hang Up is You"" as these are true classic memories of the great country of the past...you'll not be disappointed!"
5,Quick and Error Free.,I initally bought a Samsung 232. It was slow and made many errors in reading discs.The Aopen is very fault tolerant and quickfor a complete review see cdrinfo.com
2,blinkers for my holiday lights,"I was hoping I could find these in the store---but went to many and no one had them. I use the old---rather large---tree lights, and this keeps them cool enough to actually turn on!Unfortunately, they all failed after just a few minutes....."
1,waste of money!,"Worked for a few moments...then went kaput. I read earlier reviews but trusted those that gave this a passing grade. You can bet that if asked again, they would give it a failing review...This should be taken off Amazons site..."
2,light flasher,It does make the lights flash but not like I was hoping. I am using it on a set of Halloween lights and all it makes them do is flicker on off like if I had the flicker bulb on the light set. If I hook it to t flouresent light it has the effect like I want as if it were about to go out like an old light fixture in a haunted house. And it heats up quick after plugging it in not sure if this should happen either.
1,Doh,"I tried this on LED lights, and it will not make them blink, the device heats up to very hot, but nothing blinks. not willing to burn my house down I put them in the trash."
1,just more junk,I was hoping for something that would make a string of Christmas light flash. (indoors) This worked for about 4 hours. Just more junk from you know where.
1,Poor product...,"Was excited that I found the blinkers, but for some reason after connecting them to the Xmas tree they didn't work. Well they worked for about one hour then stopped. Better luck next time I guess. I'll try them again this Xmas maybe I'll have better luck."
3,Do not use on more than one string of lights! Be Careful when using this!,This product worked great on my non flashing christmas tree but melted when using on outside lights using more than one string of lights. This company should have instructions with this product.
3,works as intended,Despite the heating issue already mentioned the little device works as it's supposed to. Xmas tree is blinking away now.
1,It's junk!!,"Plugged our mini Christmas lights into it, plugged it into the wall and within 15 minutes smelled it burning on the inside. Need I say more?"
3,Somewhat pleased,This product works ok but out of the 5 two of them would not cause the lights to flicker. These are hard to find and I am happy that Amazon carries them.Thank you
3,News Flash,"We buy these flashers in bulk for Halloween effects. I will say that these are (to my knowledge) the least expensive ones found on the internet.The only problem is that typically 20% of them do not work. We buy ten, we get 8 that work. If you can live with that, then go for it! When they work, they work!"
3,"Outlet Flashers: Versatile, inexpensive, but expect a high failure rate","I use these outlet flashers for increased visibility of the signs and lighting for my business. The flashers were probably designed for, and are very useful for holiday lighting. The good: these flashers are very inexpensive and versatile. The bad: occasionally a brand-new flasher is dead-on-arrival; a few flashers fail after a few hours of operation; but... some of the flashers will work for months. Acknowledging a high failure rate, keep a few spare flashers on hand."
2,Cooper flasher bad product,"Bad product, bought 5 and 1 failed within 8 hours and 1 would not work at all, would not recommend."
2,not worth it,i bought this thinking it would make my lights blink but it didn't work at all but i was not going to return it and pay for shipping
2,Not the best book for learning ultrasound pathology,"This book is mediocre compared to some other diagnostic ultrasound books. Although the images presented in the book are of good quality, The author seldom labels parts or pathology mentioned in the images. For example, ""arrows"" should always be used for each ultrasound image illustration that was discussed in the text. For someone just starting out or learning how to interpret sonographic images, this is a must. Bottom line: This book may be ideal for experienced sonologists or technologists, but it is not helpful for beginners.I also bought, Diagnostic Imaging: Ultrasound by Anil Ahuja, MD. This one is well organized with structured and detailed examples and explanations. Thus, if you are a beginner, I do not recommend Rumack's book. I recommend Anil Ahuja's book."
5,Ultimate textbook for Sonographers!!!,"This book has surpassed all my expectations. US pictures are excellent and it has everything and more. It is more than a complete text for reference for sonographers. It also talks about patient preparation and scanning techniques. After buying almost every ultrasound book out there, I finally found the book that has all the answers I was looking for. Save your money from buying other books. This is ""IT"". If there is a ""wow"" rating, I would give it to this one."
5,RUMACK ULTRASOUND BOOKS,"I have been in ultrasound for over 20 years. I will ALWAYS buy the new addition of these books. No ultrasound library should be without them. Beautiful images, accurate data and clear text. I love these books!!!"
5,$$ saver,"these book were used condition, but still in very good shape!! especially for the money, i would definitely buy them all over again! thanks for the great product"
3,Wondering about pyramid,"I bought both the front and the rear option for this and this one is great no problems at all. Fits great and works great, but the back brakes are garbage. How does that work?"
2,misleading,beautiful filming is the only reason it got two stars instead of one. taking scences from another movie and adding a new narrator is just plain crazy. thank god i did not spend the money and actually buy this instead of renting. if you own planet earth do not buy or watch this....
1,Zero stars....I have been robbed,"I already have the Planet Earth DVD's, and all of this footage is from that. I am outraged. And Planet Earth is way better and doesn't cut scenes out like this does."
2,Not quite a kid movie,"I bought this movie as a present for my four year old niece. With the previews and Disney's endorsement, I ASSUMED this would be child-appropriate. It even says something about it being a family feature. However, within the first 30 minutes or so it shows an animal being killed by another animal AND a baby elephant losing it's way from it's mother and the narrator giving it no hope. Planet Earth is a beautiful documentary, but there are aspects about nature a four year old doesn't want to see. Unless you want to answer questions about why the baby elephant is lost and will die, don't show this to your children!!!"
1,Disappointing....,Is it just me or does the editing seem awkward? In our copy the exact same scene with the walruses and the male polar bear was shown twice. At different times! And he dies! Twice! I really should have screened it (my fault) and we already own Planet Earth so that makes it a complete waste of money. Shame on you Disney. I expect more quality.
2,Great photography of animals killing other animals,"There's no denying that the photography is spectacular, particularly in Blu-Ray. But did they have to continually focus on the harshness of life. Thousands of elephants make it across the desert, alive. Yet they focus on the one that is killed. Same thing with the other species. More camera time seems to be devoted to showing one animal hunting and kill another than on the glory and continuance of life. The grand story is really that of survival -- not of ""battles"" and killing.Do animals kill other animals to survive? Of course they do. We KNOW that. But why do filmmakers feel THIS side of the story is the most important, the one to emphasize in nature films? And the suspenseful music and James Earl Jones' ominous narration makes it sound like a replay of Jaws."
3,Good but violent,Good movie with great scenes HD but for a Disney Movie it's a bit violent and I don't think it was meant for the children.
2,Planet Earth Re-Packaged,"enjoy watching nature shows. I like watching the predator chase down the rabbit or even when the rabbit sneaks away. I know I'm going to get a lesson on saving the animal's habitat and, sue me, I enjoy it.Then I watched Disney's Earth DVD.Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, I need to explain why I don't like this film.If you have already seen the documentary that Discovery and the BBC released called Planet Earth, you have seen Disney's earth. They essentially trimmed down the nature shots so it can be seen as a film, and added James Earl Jones as the narrator.Because this is a slimmer Planet Earth, the shots are still phenomenal. But they are the same exact shots we've already seen.If you haven't seen Planet Earth, you need to rent it.If you don't have the attention span for a multi-disc documentary like Planet Earth, rent Earth."
4,A movie for science teachers,"This movie is the perfect answer for the science teacher looking to show something that will capture students attention and be related to your curriculum. I showed this video in the last few days of school and it kept the students (grade 9, biology class) attention with the amazing camera work and beautiful scenery. Be sure go to [...] to get a teacher made worksheet to go with the movie."
5,Beautiful Movie,The photography in this film was breathtaking! It was an eye opener to see so many beautiful things in creation as well as sad to see the dangers that the creatures have to face because of 'mans ungrateful hands'.
1,BBC Planet Earth turned boring and depressing,"Maybe I was disappointed because I've seen all this footage before in ""Planet Earth"", but this was just sad. I guess Disney bought the footage from BBC and then somehow made it less interesting. This film moves slower, covers less of the interesting footage, and somehow makes is much more depressing than BBC's version, even though it is about the same animal stories. I love James Earl Jones as a narrator, but the script is lame.Reasons to BUY BBC's Planet Earth instead:1. Covers much more amazing footage in addition to almost all the same footage in Disney's ""Earth""2. Covers the same animal stories, just not as depressing as Disney's version (more kid friendly)3. Gives more interesting information4. Moves faster (Kid friendly yet informative for all ages)"
1,I saw all this allready,"I can not say its not an excellent work, it is, great sound, and video footage too, but if you have seen or, like me, you own Planet Earth, there`s no reason to spend $$$ in this, I prefer to buy Planet Earth [...] conclusion, good work, same work , different name to something already released for a different company, pure business and scam to hook you up and make money, not really respect to customers in these days."
3,Just didn't feel good,"It is a good Movie, but is about how tough the animals have it in nature. It is not a feel good movie really, like March of the Penguins was."
4,"Abridge version of BBC's ""Planet Earth""","Okay, a lot of people are complaining that this is a shorter version of BBC's ""Planet Earth"". If you don't want to sit through an entire week's worth of stunning high definition footage of our great planet, you can watch this instead in one sitting. I've seen both, this Disney (short) version and the BBC (long) version. I'll have to say, I enjoyed both equally! The narration is geared towards children (it's Disney, for crying out loud). This version uses the same superb high definition footage from the BBC version, just shorter (e.g. instead of showing the entire one-week time lapse footage where the sun never set, it showed just one day). Overall, I'd give it 4 stars for a production geared to a specific audience."
2,"Avoid if you have seen BBC's ""Planet Earth""","I wish I would have done more research before purchased ""Earth."" ""Earth"" is a basically a condensed, child friendly version of ""Planet Earth."" It's great if you want to expose your children to the wonders of planet earth, but they lack the patience to sit through the BBC series. I also thought the narration left something to be desired. It did not really add much to the film and felt ""dumbed-down."" Disney's choice of James Earl Jones was also kind of comical, as I felt that Darth Vader himself was teaching me about the earth. The movie looks great, but we have seen it all before. If the series ""Planet Earth"" never came out, I could easily give this 4 stars, but ""Earth"" is just recycled footage with dry narration."
1,Waste of money.,"We got this because the trailer looked so exciting, but I wish I had read the reviews first. Not only is it kind of uninspiring, but it repeatedly creates suspense over the death of the animals. Look at the family of polar bears, aren't they adorable, oh wait, the Daddy bear is lost at sea, starving to death. Oh no! The baby elephant is dehydrated and near dying, will he make it to the water hole?It was horrible that we watched it with my 4-year-old. The only part he liked were the amazing footage of the waterfalls where it feels like you're going over. I didn't feel like it told a story about the animal families, it lost focus when it followed other animals, and it was too morbid. I wish I could get my money back."
2,"Uhm, a documentary from another documentary?","If you've seen Planet Earth already, there is no reason at all to watch this. All this movie is is bits and pieces of Planet Earth. It just makes no sense."
1,Booooooo Boooooo,Really disappointed. I purchased Earth because I thought it would have unique footage. The whole movie is made from the Planet Earth series. No where on the packaging of the movie did it say this was footage from Planet Earth. Don't buy. Save your money.
1,What a rip off !,"I couldn't believe I paid for a collection of clips from a documentary I already own, only with a inferior narration. Disney, I want my money back!"
3,Let down,I thought it was going to be briillant colors and images showing the majesty of our planet and the animals in it. WRONG. It is one tramatic story after another and the camera work was lacking.
1,repackage by your friends at disney,"special guest: Darth Vader narrates this pos, which is simply planet earth footage re-cut into a compilation of shorter more broken up parts. I hate disney and the jonas brothers with their purity rings. bah. deserves negative stars, a big fine and punches in the faces of all the executive board members at disney."
2,OK,I loved the movie. but I received the movie box in a very bad condition. the whole box was broken.
1,"This DVD was damaged, I returned it and never got a new one, I got ripped off. IT SUCKS!!!","Im affraid to buy DVD's at Amazon now because I got one that was supposely ""new"" but it was damaged when I first played it, I contacted the person who sold it to me and asked to return it which I did, but I never got it back nor the money nor the DVD. what a fiasco!!"
3,Rent from Vudu instead - it's a pixelated mess,The movie itself was fine. Our three kids enjoyed it. What was terrible was the bit rate. No buffering or streaming issues here. Amazon is just using too low of a bitrate for their HD movies.
4,Cats Love This,"I've used these seed pods (I got the holder the first time I ever purchased them) many times with my Drinkwell Pet Fountain. They grow quickly and my cats do enjoy chewing on the fresh greens. The only problem I ever have is that they tend to make the water/bowl kind of slimey. I clean it regularly so it's not a huge problem. I also found that if I rinse the seed pod off every couple of days it helps. Again, not a big issue. And my indoor cats do enjoy having access to greens."
2,Too loose,I liked the idea of this since my cat is primarily indoors but found that the pod was too loose. Whenever my cat would go eat the grass the entire pod would come out and if I wasn't home could die before I found it.
1,Nothing grew,"I've purchased this before from a pet store and it was great.On this particular purchase, the grass never grew; only the roots. Waste of $$."
1,Seemed like a good idea.,"Good idea but these problems:1. Takes several days (for me approx. 3-5)to grow so there will always be a period of time where there is no grass, I was required to continue to go to the local pet store for grass.2. Produces a very small amount of grass. Two of these cartridges cost about $5.29 not including shipping. I can buy local catgrass for the same price with about 92% more surface area. Meaning that it reduces the amount of grass available to your cat by 92%.3. Turns the water filthy very quickly. If you use this product you should also invest in their fountain filter.I really had hoped this would be a great idea, and may in the future, but they still have some problems to work out.I must recommend you try their fountain, my cats love it and drink more water which we all know is healthier. That product is a clear winner.Drinkwell Pet Fountain for Cats"
2,aqua garden,"I have indoor only cats so I thought this would be a great product. Well, problem is, once the green shoots pop up my cat pulls the whole thing out and I find it on the floor. It turned into a game to see how long it would stay in the bowl before my cat pulled it back out. I tried other seeds but they just rotted. A good idea that just didn't work out for me and my active cats."
3,Drinkwell aqua garden seed pods,My cats enjoyed the leafy greens very much! I would recommend to anyone with cats. Just make sure to check the fountain daily as some of the stalks come loose from the pod and can get stuck in the filter.
2,Cats trashed them right away,"Since they just hang on the side of the water fountain, the cats immediately dragged them out, getting water all over everything. Nothing ever had time to germinate."
4,Cat Grass Garden Refills,Interesting product; great for indoor cats in the snowy winters; will order more
2,Drinkwell seed pods,"I did not read well enough to realize it would not work with my Drinkwell 360, no place to attach it. I planted the seeds, but they did not sprout."
1,"good concept, falls short","I purchased the aqua garden along with the platinum fountain and 2 refills for the garden. I am regretting my purchase of the aqua garden and refills. I have one cat that eats the grass, and it is not the lush little pod of kitty grass that grows, but a sparse few thin blades of inferior grass. It took a few days to start growing (no big deal), but then it really did not grow well after that. My cat does gnaw on it, but either he is eating faster than it grows, or it just is not growing well. I feel that the kind in dirt that you can buy at the pet store is a better fit (at least for my kitty). I am going to try starting it in a different container and then putting it into the fountain, so I will update if there is any improvement with that method."
1,not worth it,"don't spend the money on this. doesn't work like you would think, (discription). not worth the mess it causes. the seeds do grow, however it will be messy."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I have 3 inside cats, and they all love to eat grass. I had purchased the Drinkwell Fountain, so when I saw the ""pods"" that grew in it, I thought, ""how great would that be?"" I was SO disappointed! The pods do not produce a lot ofgrass, it's very sparse, but the worst part is the roots grow all out into the water causing it to become very slimy, very quickly. So bad, in fact, I did not want my cats drinking the water. If someone knows something about this product that I don't, I would appreciate knowing about it."
5,All in one place,"this is a very good idea for all of us that perhaps dont have a garden or no place for a plant , my 4 cat love it, and they really grow fast enough, in 3 to 4 days you will see them growing. the only thing i will recommend is to check water level (as indicated by the manufacturer) because it goes down really fast."
3,Unimpressive,"We have 2 cats and were excited to give these a try. Very little grass sprouted, though lots of roots formed and started growing in the water in the basin of the fountain. After only a few days, we noticed the cats were not drinking the water as much and that there was algae forming in the water. We ended up having to scrub the water fountain thoroughly and replacing the filter . . . all only after a very short time (a few days) of sprouted grass. The cats did like the taste of the grass, but I recommend keeping grass and water separated."
1,Aqua Garden Seed Pods,"Although a great idea I was very disappointed with this product. The seed pods started molding before they started sprouting. A few sprouts finally grew, but the water was slimy by then. I had to throw away a new filter and completely clean all parts of the Drinkwell fountain. Now I understand why my cats had started demanding water from other sources. Their fountain was contaminated."
1,Not a good choice,"I bought two of these, one for me and one for my girlfriend. The grass grew very quickly in both, but so did the BLACK MOLD. I had to throw out my new filter and sterilize the entire fountain. The fountain is great, but I won't be buying the grass again."
3,"Good, but...","I hate it when things don't fit - my pants, batteries, screws, guitars. I hate it even more when they almost fit - when were the fabric just a little stretchier or had you eaten just one less cookie, had you drilled the whole with the next smaller bit, had the guitar maker not put that decorative flourish at the end of the neck, things would fit perfectly.This case is just fine save for one thing: I can't quite close the zipper over the end of the guitar. Is the problem bad enough to send it back? No. The case wasn't expensive, it seems more than rugged enough for my son, the padding is as good as I was expecting, and at the end of the day it seems more trouble than it's worth to send it back. But why couldn't it be a quarter inch longer? My wife stuck a stocking cap over the end - problem solved. And really, the case is quite decent. But aggravation costs you stars, in this case 1 1/2. Much better to make something like this slightly too long than slightly too short."
3,guitar bag,fast shipping. not as padded as I thought it would be. good for transporting cheap guitar to and from practice.
5,Guitar Bag,"This item arrived before the guitar. Well packaged, in good condition, at a reasonable price. It is perfect for the Hohner 3/4 guitar I purchased."
4,Good gig bag,"I bought this guitar gig bag for 3/4 inches from my son and as I look. The quality is also quite good, exactly as expected for the price it has."
3,"Good, but not quite what I was looking for","This case is great! It has an extra pouch in the front for sheet music and backpack straps. Unfortunately, it was too small for the huge guitar I have."
5,Excellent Music,"Magus is what I would call a Space Rock band, with a definite progressive rock sound with very spacey sections. The vocals are very pleasant, and the instrumentals are just wonderful to listen to. I've been at work listening to this CD, and people will come in and ask what I am listening too, and this music is really cool.So, if you are into progresssive rock at all, and like a space type element to your music, Magus is a band you should not pass up."
1,The Pearl Of The soul Of The World,"The book was a page turner. Now, I read almost a book a day but when I got to the end of the book I was furious with the author. I have read many of her books and I would rate most of them 5 star but this book 1 star seems to much. If she was going to have such a bad ending it seemes to me that she should write a fourth book having a happy ending. And Mrs.pierce if you ever read this its nothing personal but my opinion is this books ending was the worst ending I have ever read."
2,Love the story...although a bad ending!,I just read the trilogy...in a matter of days...The story was perfect...in the first two books that is. This one seemed it wasn't written as strongly because the author just wanted to dop it...and I agree with most of the reviews...this ending bites! Poor Irrylth...is that spelled right? Ahem...I like most wanted a freaking happy ending...You know a fourth book would be cool...you know...Irrylth did say she would free Ariel from her enchantment...hey why not? His turn now! Come on! If you're the author...people want more than how that trilogy ended.....I feel like I'm writting a fanfic review...all around...cutting the ending...this book could have been better...I recomend the first two as winners!
3,Not Free SF Reader,The third book in the Darkangel trilogy is a bit of an improvement. More is discovered about the planet and the background of some of the major players running around the place.Aeriel and others must decide what to do when it seems that some very serious sacrifice may be required to keep everything going.
3,Please..... let there be a fourth book!,"I really liked the first two books. Darkangel and A Gathering of Gargolyes. I particularly liked the second volume because Aerial displayed great character and courage. However, the last book, The Pearl of the Soul of the World did not live up to my expectations. Aerial lacked character, she didn't do anything extraordinary in this book. There was no adventure like the second volume. I was disappointed at the way the story ended. Aerial sacrificed herself throughout the story. Despite the finality of this triolgy, the story line is wonderful. Everyone who loves adventure and fantasy stories should consider reading this trilogy. The ending leaves me longing for more. Could Aerial take part in any other story that you're writing Ms. Pierce? I would love to see Aerial again, along with her trusted friend Erin. Thnak you for a wonderful journey."
2,Stop before the end,"I loved this series, it's was beautifully written, complex, and heartfelt. Until the end. Take my advice and and stop before reaching the end of the novel. It was an unsatisfying and disappointing conclusion to an otherwise amazing trilogy."
2,Crestfallen,"I'll start out by saying the Darkangel Trilogy is fantastic.The first two had me completely entranced, as did this third one. But the first time I read the ending to this book, I cried. I hated the book, the series, everything about it. It took my a while to get over it and finally about a year later, I started thinking rationally again. Maybe I over reacted and the ending, though sad, had it's point. So I went back and read it again. To my surprise, I had the same reaction, this second time as I did the first. I was completely unsatisfied.I'm a reader who does not need a faerie tale ending to everything, but there were so many other options for the end that would have made it better, if not 'happily ever after,' that I must say it is unexcusable. It was as if the author got bored and decided to wrap things up as quickly as possible rather than think it out. It's too bad there was such an ending to a remarkable series."
2,Extremely disappointing ending!,"While I loved the first two books and waited forever for this last book, the ending absolutely ruined the book for me. Ms. Pierce seemed like she was trying to be ""deep"" with her ending, but it was baffling, completely unsatisfying, and very weak. She didn't have to write a 100% happy ending, but I expected some satisfaction & fulfillment and received only frustration. Aeriel completely acted out-of-character: she worked so hard to free her Dark-angel and have his love, only to nonchalantly hand him over to his annoying cousin! Though I hated the ending, Ms. Pierce did create a remarkable and inventive universe with her first 2 books (the 2 stars are for her first two books)"
5,Pearl of the Soul of the World,"A little confusing, the book starts out with a Nameless Girl suffering from chronic pain that keeps her from remembering or even speaking. There aren't many clues as to the identity of the girl, so the revelation of just who this character is, is rather pleasing.In the third installment of the Darkangel Trilogy, the readers get to see the war between the Lorelei and the mortals played out. The moment we've been waiting for. The triumph will belong to whom? There's also a special little task that the lovable heroine must undergo that will determine the success or failure of the war for the mortals.Sometimes a little hard to follow, but still very worth it in the end, even though I wasn't too satisfied with the ending, I was still content with the ending."
4,the series was all together great but the ending was bad,"I loved the Darkangle series and the writing was really good. I loved the way everything was made up, even the sun and moon had a different name. The only thing I would change was the ending because it was really disappointing."
3,Don't get me wrong...,"...it this book were in any other series, I'd give it a 5. But as the ending to ""the Darkangel"", it seems kinda lame. It's missing the fairytale-like magic that swirls around the 1st and 2nd books. Way too many words are spent on Aerial's thoughts. At the end of the book, there are pages and pages spent on Aerial's talk with Ravenna. That part was supposed to be Ravenna trying to convince Aerial that leaving is necessary, and yet it sounds more as if Pierce is trying to convince the readers that this is the best possible ending. Pierce takes up pages trying to justify her own writing ( which an author should never do ) and mops up the rest of the ending with unnecessary haste."
3,It was not the best in the series,"This was an okay book, but I didn't like it as much as the first. The ending is just so hopeless. I know some people will disagree with me but that's the way it feels."
5,Truely lovely writing~,"Well, what can I say? This has been my favorite book for almost six years and though I have not reread it since I was 11 ( I moved to Taiwan when I was 12, and english fantasy novels are verly rare here. ) I have never forgotten it. I would love so much to get a copy of this book, but it was out of print even before I left the US and I have never been able to find it since."
4,Unexpected ending,"I was entranced when I first read ""The Darkangel."" Just like her Firebringer Trilogy, I found M.A. Pierce's style to be delightful and engrossing. I found myself honestly caring about Aeriel, Irrylath the Darkangel, the gargoyles and even the wraiths. In ""A Gathering of Gargolyes"" I delighted in the knowledge that Aeriel wasn't just a lowly slave, and found myself honestly hoping Aeriel and Irrylath would find a way to work it all out. Then, in ""The Pearl of the Soul of the World,"" I felt it all building toward what I hoped would be a satisfying conclusion. Nope. I'm crestfallen and saddened. A beautiful series... but I think I should have stopped reading at the end of Chapter 14 (""Flood""). If M.A. Pierce was trying to impart a message (i.e. ""We have to sacrifice for the greater good"") she could have saved the trouble. Why not have a lon shuttle Aeriel to Avaric daily? Conjugal visits complete with saving the world. Disappointing ending to a lovely trilogy."
3,does a bad core spoil the whole apple?,"the core of a story is the ending. when you put the book down, that's what you remember. that's how you relate to the story. I really get into the world of any book that i'm reading, and when the book has an unsatisfying ending, i get very angry and depressed. I like the happy fairy-tale, disney style ending, happily ever after but a slight bit more realistic. if the culmination of ... and two hours of time is depressing, why read it? of course that might not bother some people. if they are you, you will like this book. i loved the writing style and the characters, their complexity, their three-dimensionality. otherwise, i would give it five stars, as well as the second book in the series. I was not able to get my hands on the first book, so i read the second and third books. now, i will not be attempting to read the first book at all, or i would start bawling."
2,"Sadly, doesn't live up to the other two...","I would have listed this at 1 star, but I am still fond of her writing style, even if this particular book lacked the sparkle of the first two.The conclusion was woefully unsatisfying, but not because it's sad, because it doesn't actually bring everything together. It feels rushed and there's a heavy-handed ""be kind to the earth"" motif that wasn't there in the first two books and the amazing mythology she'd created is tossed aside for a jumble.I do like surprises and twists in books, but not these kinds of twists."
2,A beautiful story with a let down ending!,"After reading Pierce's first two books I was enthralled beyond beliefe. It was disapointing how long it took for her to write the third book, but then reading how she ended this wonderfully written story I was sad and angry.I would be definately sugest reading the first 2 books, but unless you like horrible endings I would not suggest reading the third book. Hey you could always create your own wonderful ending."
5,A great trilogy...,"i absolutely loved all three books... but i was left hanging at the end. HOw well does Ariel do as the new ""Ravenna""? What happens to Irrylath?... Ms. Pierce would do really well if she wrote some kind of an epilogue... that would be soooo great if she could do that..."
4,Sweet movie,"This was an unusual movie to me. It's like it couldn't decide if it was a comedy or drama. I've know the term ""dramedy"" and I suppose that is what it was. It's just that it changed drastically from comedy to drama from scene to scene. Yet, it was a enthralling movie at about the second half.A little girl has PTSD from watching her father die a horrible death. She can hear but only pays attention if you sing. The plot is a little silly at times but only the most cynical will not be touched. The personality of little Amy and her beautiful voice makes this a worthwhile film to see."
2,Had a hard time with this movie,"I really wanted to like this movie, but most of it felt like a really bad SNL skit. Had a few really funny parts, but most of it was a bomb for me.Worth a look for the few funny parts, but I just couldn't buy into the movie as a whole. It's a shame to, because I really like Kristen Wiig."
3,Movie Was Hyped Too Much,No complaints in the quality of the product or timely shipping - all that was quite good. The movie in itself was disappointing - hyped entirely too much.
3,BridesMaids,Got a great deal on black Friday couldn't pass it up. Not as funny as others made it out to be but all in all a good movie.
3,Not as funny as I hoped.,maybe because I am a dude. I thought it was cute. I am a big fan of the forty year old virgin. Maybe this would have been funnier if paul rudd was in it. Melissa McCarthy does make this movie. Hard to believe that she was on Gilmore Girls.
2,Blah,Didn't understand what all the hype was about. I was not a fan of this movie. Not very funny at all.
1,Horrible! What a waste of money.,"I'm pissed! This movie was terrible. Two, long, drawn out, unfunny hours. Whoever said this was the female version of The Hangover has their head up their ass. Are you kidding me?!"
2,Bridesmaids Movie,"It's a great movie for the most part. However, there was about a 3 minute part of the movie that was skipped."
2,What a Disappointment,I really wanted to see this and finally bought it. I never laughed out loud. None of the characters were caring individuals. I rather watch Married with Children reruns.
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"Not sure what it was that everybody was seeing in this ""chick flick,"" but I found it formulaic, boring and silly. Nothing fresh about it, just the same old ""meet cute"" between Annie and the cop (who is waaaayy too good for her!), with a half-million F-bombs thrown in. The women who appear in the movie are good actresses, but the all-too-predictable story stinks. I'm sorry I wasted my money buying it, but so many reviewers said it was hilarious. Very, very disappointing and I do not recommend it. Go with New Year's Eve or Rock of Ages, if you want a fun movie night."
3,Female version of Hangover...NOT!,"When I first started seeing commercials of this movie, I immediately thought this looks like a female version of The Hangover, and wanted to see it as soon as it was released. Of course I didn't make it to see in theaters, but I did get it on release day as a rental and I'm glad I did. First off it's not a female equivalent to The Hangover although it tries to be at times. It has only spurts of laughter here and there not all the way through like I was expecting. Not to say that it's not worth seeing just not as good as I was expecting it to be. Melissa McCarthy was the funniest to me which surprised me because I was thinking the SNL alums would have been. I'll say it's good for a rental, but pass on purchasing the DVD. I would have given it a 2 1/2 stars, but since I couldn't I gave it 3."
2,Fails to Deliver,"Did the reviewers from the LA/NY Times watch the same movie my husband and I did? Did they write glowing reviews on the promise of getting their money back??Rather than showing that ""women can do comedy"", Bridesmaids instead ends up saying ""women comedians can be as gross as men...but not as funny."" It was the movie let-down of 2011 for us. The unsympathetic characters leave you with no one to root for, adrift for 2 hours waiting for it to end. There were long stretches that were more painful than funny, and it jumped from storyline to storyline with little coherence at all. That said, it does have a few funny quips that I am sure can be gleaned from imdb.com without giving up $4 or 2 hours of your life.We've watched The Hangover 3 times, and laughed our butts off each time. If only we could UNwatch Bridesmaids."
4,It Gets Better,"I'm really glad that I watched this a second (and third!) time on dvd. When I first saw it I laughed so much, but walked out of the theater not particularly liking the movie, which was odd. I think it's because they went to some extremes--the infamous food poisoning sequence was more geared towards a male audience--and Kristen Wiig's character got so selfish and rude at one point, that I hadn't quite forgiven her by the end of the movie. But when I re-watched it it all sort of made sense within the context of this particular film and I realized that they broke the mold and managed to make a chick movie appeal to a wide audience, and that's no small feat. I wouldn't have cared if there weren't such a realistic female best friendship at the heart of this movie--there are some great rom com moments--but it's ultimately a love story about female friendships. And that's cool."
4,Bridesmaids,"I expected the case to be in a little better shape. It shipped well before it was supposed to, so that is a positive note. I think my mother-in-law will like it. I hope she excepts it in the shape that it is in. A service, definitely!"
3,Cute Movie,"Def a chick flick. It was cute and we enjoyed it. Not the best movie I have ever seen, but not the worse either."
5,Bride's Maids is the best!!,MY husband and I saw it three times. We laughed until our cheeks hurt!! We cannot wait to own a copy. LOVED IT!!!
1,Save Your Money!,"I rented this flik with my girlfriend. I knew it would be a chick-flik, but I generally can get a laugh or two . . . both my girlfriend and I (both college educated and fairly hip) sat there dumbfounded that so many people actually liked this bundle of cliche's, bad script and shallow acting . . . it was like Sex in the City only not . . . We laughed maybe once, sighed a lot and then turned it off about 3/4 through. Don't buy the hype, this movie was awful, save your cash!"
5,Best,"This is my favorite movie of all time! To receive this movie in such great condition and great price, it's amazing. I'm glad I ordered this movie and have it in my collection."
3,Okay movie,"I love chick flick and comedies, but this movie was a movie I was okay with watching only once. I'm a little disappointed as it seemed like a funny movie (which it is at some points), but overall is an ""okay"" movie."
1,"This movie is awesome, but....",The Amazon video streaming is awful! I order movies frequently - I have never experienced the problem(s) Amazon presented...first and last time!!!!!
1,Terrible,"I don't really write many reviews, but was inclined to do so for this movie, as it was truly awful. It was billed as ""The Hangover for Women"" (which, by the way was hilarious), but fell quite short. There were a few moments that brought a chuckle, but as with much of Kristen Wiig's writing, the jokes were forced and generally, not funny. If the movie is on tv, it's worth your time if you have nothing else to do, but I certainly would not invest money in purchasing it!"
1,JUST AWFUL!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE I'VE SEEN IN AGES. IT WAS SO BAD I CUT IT OFF AFTER 45 MINUTES, SOMETHING I HAVEN'T DONE IN I DON'T KNOW WHEN. IT WAS NOT FUNNY, STUPID AND SO GROSS IT WAS FINALLY TOO NAUSEATING TO TAKE ANYMORE OF!!!"
1,We want our 2 hours back.,"My wife brought this home from the library after hearing several of her co-workers and library patrons proclaim how great this movie was. We should never have listened to them. I've heard some proclaim this to be ""The Hangover for women"" or ""better than The Hangover"", I do not know their sense of humor, but it is certainly not in alignment with ours. We couldn't stop laughing at The Hangover, with Bridesmaids, we couldn't start laughing. There were very few moments that made us actually chuckle out loud, and even fewer that were not predictable as to what the joke was, and fewer still that didn't overstay their welcome on screen. It seems do not care for Kristen Wiig's humor as she was one of the worst parts of the movie for us. Just not good at all. I personally have no idea how this is resonating with so many people, it just doesn't make sense to me."
1,flaming turd,"This is one of the most excruciating experiences of my adult life. 3 hours of waiting for it to become funny and you think ""i paid to see it and it got good reviews"". Find something else to watch or smoke the pistol now cause this movie SUCKS!"
1,Don't waste your time.,"This movie was terrible, at times painful to watch, if you have seen the previews, you have seen the best parts of the movie."
1,Brides Maids,This movie is so trashy and stupid. What a waste of my time and money. The plot of the movie could have been great without all the trashiness. I was disappointed to see Jill Clayburgh play in such a horrible film. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
1,Bad disk,I am so mad. The dvd completely stopped working 20 min int the movie and started skipping then stopped working completely.
2,Overrated and not very funny,"After hearing all the buzz and good reviews over the summer I was excited to watch this movie. If you feel the same way I did, stop. This movie is very cliche... All the funny parts were shown on the preview and throughout the movie you keep hoping it will get funny.... alas it doesn't. Don't waste your time on this movie. You'll totally regret it.2 out of 5 stars only due to the food poisoning scene."
2,Bad taste,"I had heard this movie was really funny and there were a couple of spots that it was but all in all I thought it was in very poor taste. I just hope no one watches this with kids around, it is even too much for teenagers. Hated it!"
2,Bridesmaids,"I got the product itself in a timely manner with no problems. The movie itself is largely forgettable. It is just a crass, rude movie at times. I don't know who thinks some of this stuff is funny. Guess I'm getting old but it would have been a great movie without the rude stuff."
2,I expected more,"This was not as funny as I expected, and I wish I hadn't spent the money on it. It wasn't terrible, but it was definitely more of a chick flick than I was expecting. There were some funny one-liners, (most ly from Melissa McCarthy), but it wasn't what I would consider a comedy. I ended up selling this back to Amazon after I watched it. It's worth .99 if you can rent it for that."
5,"Funniest movie since ""The Hangover""","God.... where do I start with this great movie. I laughed from start to finish, just about peed !!The girls from Mad TV, Saturday Night Live are just so good at comedy, this film had no hope of dissappointment. Add ""Megan"" to the list and some great bit parts by ""Rodes"" the Irish love intrest and ""John the Air Marshall"" provide some great dimensions to this cracking comedy.The plot is hardly important, the script, casting and physical comedy are done perfectly. Kristen Wiig is just perfect as Kate, the ""Maid of honour' in this flick. ""Megan"" steals the show with many great scenes and one liners and a great effort by Rose Byrne as the beautiful nemesis.A lot of adlib makes it's way through the cutting room floor and hits the spot, there are some great scenes that got squeezed out that are on the DVD extras and are an added laugh.This is as good as it gets in a comedy, just loved it."
3,Its OK,"I must be crazy, with all these 5 or 1 star reviews to sit right in the center.I thought it was worth watching if you enjoy a little rauchy comedy and romantic comedy. No doubt, this movie is a hodgepodge of the two.It's definitely not the funniest movie I've ever seen, or even seen recently. I do not however feel like it was a total waste of time, there were a few scenes that made me and my husband laugh pretty hard. It just wasn't all the way through the movie, and the hype from everyone telling me it's the best movie and so hilarious left me expecting more. Temper your expectations!The pacing of the movie was a bit of a problem for me, every so often (much like SNL or Mad TV) there is a joke that just isn't that funny and goes on for way too long.M. McCarthy was the best, when she was in a scene I knew it was going to make me giggle."
3,Kind of Creepy,"My wife loved this movie. There are things they could have left out and still been a good movie. The comedy and acting was done well but overall, I didn't care for it."
4,Not what I thought But Good!,This was a very good movie but I have to say the previews that I saw were misleading it really was not as funny as the previews made it seem. There was a lot going on but it was still a good movie!
5,Instant Classic & Awesome,"Not without it's flaws, but I have to give it 5 Stars for breaking the glass ceiling of woman's place in comedic films. This movie is for every woman that's sat through movie after movie of guys behaving badly, stupidly, outrageously and hysterically, and wondered ""Where are the women? Where are the movies that show that women can be just as funny?"" Well, here it is. Enjoy!"
3,NOT TOO FUNNY,"So, much publicity on this movie. Some actors were funny but some were not. Maybe it was in the script. the comedy was visual. Didn't care for it."
5,Hilarious,"This movie is so damn funny. Kristen Wiig is hilarious, along with the rest of the brilliant cast. Not for people who don't like gritty humor and poop jokes. Great for women who have the senses of humor like that of teenage boys. Now you can have the best of both worlds; foul but smart jokes co-mingling with not so foul, relatable humor that focuses on the friendships between women, and the funny but painful truth of getting knocked down in life, and trying to get back up again."
3,Expected much more,"Maybe it's because I'm male ... I'd give this movie a B-. And it's not for the fact that it was a bad story - in fact it was a great story of friends sticking together. I guess I just expected much more humor. Outside of 2-3 good scenes all the others seemed a bit tired and old. The 2-3 scenes that I loved were certainly unexpected and gave me a different view of female humor. I guess I was just hoping for more outrageous, unexpected situations that I KNOW women find themselves in. I'm guessing the female gender wants to keep them hidden a bit longer.Hall Pass was a good movie that gave you both slants of the story - and both sides were very funny."
5,laughter is wonderful,"This movie was recommended to me by my daughter who said she and her friends couldn't quit laughing. HOWEVER, at first I thought they might have been ""under the influence"" as it wasn't starting out very funny. AND THEN IT HAPPENED. Started laughing and couldn't quit all the way through. Laughed so hard my husband had to come in and look....and then he was laughing off his seat also."
3,Too much hype,"I thought this was going to be better. It didn't have a good storyline, things were predictable, and wasn't really that funny."
3,unexpected,"It had several funny parts. It wasn't what I was expecting. Everyone has been talking about how good it is and how funny, but I was a disappointed. Yes, it was funny at times, but it also was awkward sometimes and I think the writer went a little over the top that just really made this movie mediocre. Overall, pretty good."
2,Not the female version of hangover,"There was some funny jokes and most of them came from a supporting character, but don't think that just becuase it is about a wedding that it is anything like The Hangover. That's how the studios billed this film, and it was a straight out lie.Sylistically it was flat. The story was was beyond predicatable and 100% not original.Other than a few jokes that you dont normally find in rom coms, this movie was nothing more than a time killer."
2,Not Impressed,"I think maybe I should have been drinking when I watched this. I laughed maybe twice. It just felt like a waste of a few hours. There were a lot of conversations, only it felt like they made it seem more like reality... with all the boring, tedious things that sometimes come along with it."
4,Not too bad,"This was a good movie, but they overplayed it on the commercials for it. It had a good story line, but I wish it was better."
5,Very funny,Humor in this movie varies but it is across the board funny for the average person and i have watched it more than once.
5,I laughed so hard I couldnt breathe,"This movie is hilarious. It is raunchy and crude in many places but also true and poignant. It takes all of the 'guy' movie cliches and turns them upside down. Spoilers...instead of the typical big city, they are somewhere in Wisconsin, no 'cool' locale is needed...they dont make the big prewedding trip, there are no exotic animals, or hookers, or gangsters or car chases. All that nonsense isnt required when the script is so very good. It is smart, funny writing in the hands of smart funny actors. Someone else said it, and I agree, movies rarely portray women as they really are. Our humor is not necessarily gentle or feminine and our language not always clean, but we can be wicked smart and funny as hell. Fav scenes--Lillian in her wedding dress...in the road, and Annie and Helen driving repeatedly by Nathan's car."
2,Not so funny bridesmaids...,"I'm a chick therefore I must be able to understand the emotional plot behind this ""hillarious"" movie. But unfortunately I did not. I can count with one hand the moments in the movie where I might have had a laugh out loud moment. The movie was almost entirely a bad drama. Why any body would compare the Hangover to BridesMaids is beyond my understanding.So if you saw the Hangover, you know it's just incredible and mostly unbelievable situations that are just to funny to be real. That's the point. The fat chick was by far the funniest but way to much almost reminisent of high school drama. This movie had more drama than it needed. I wouldn't recommend to own."
5,Awesome movie,"I'm a guy, and writing this review. i took my girlfriend to see this movie, and loved it. its a great movie for both sexes. i ended up buying this movie, because i wanted to make sure we could watch it again and again in hi-def, and unrated. great movie!!!"
2,Bridesmaids,"What a let down! This movie was so talked up but there was only 1-2 funny bits in it the rest was crap, waste of money."
5,Hilarious,I saw this at the movies and thought it was so funny that I bought a copy to have on hand.
5,Awesome,"Amazing price, perfect quality...couldnt resistnfor gifts, bought more than one! Highly recommended movie and highly recommend buying through amazon for dvds."
4,very funny,I really did like this movie. Its very funny and quite cute. I would recomend it to anyone who wants a silly funny movie
5,Great service!,"I got this movie very quickly after it was shipped, and it came in a perfectly fine case with no blemishes or scrapes or anything. Thanks so much!"
3,Fun! I did expect better writing...,"Some wonderful pratfalls, hoots and goofs but in the long run, I expected better writing, instead of typical sit-com denouement stuff. Missed opportunities for political and social satire that went instead to fart/vomit type jokes. Boredom set in."
2,meh,I wanted to like this. However it was not to be. Not my cup of tea. Parts of this were okay. could do without the crass humor.
4,Funny Movie!,"When I saw this movie on the big screen the first time, I laughed and enjoyed it so much that I had to buy it as soon as it came out on Blu-ray. I didn't notice much of a difference between the unrated version and the original version. Regardless, I recommend this movie to everyone. You'll definitely have a good laugh."
4,Being a bridesmaid isn't just about the dress,"""Bridesmaids"" was not just a laugh 'em up type movie. Oh yes - there were some hilarious parts. Actually quite a few of them. But there were also some parts of the movie that were emotional to watch.Jealousy (of your best friend status) and don't lie - especially to yourself - you have probably been there; drinking too much and making a fool out of yourself; sleeping with someone just so you won't be alone even if the guy is the biggest user/loser on the planet; keeping your eyes open for Mr. Right when he's standing right in front of you; and on and on.Kristen Wiig was great as wounded best friend Annie; Maya Rudolph was perfect as Lillian the bride; Chris O'Dowd was VERY cute as Officer Rhodes; Rebel Wilson/Matt Lucas were the creepiest brother/sister roommates ever; and Melissa McCarthy as Megan was spectacular in all of her role but especially her pep talk.This is definitely a chick flick - a high caliber one at that."
5,Love this movie!,"This is a great laugh out loud movie! I've seen it multiple times with both family and friends, girls and guys, and everyone seems to enjoy it. Melissa McCarthy is a true star in this, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh!"
2,Melissa McCarthy deserves an Oscar nomination,"Bridesamaids definitely does not live up to all the hype. There were a few scenes that were painful to watch: the scenes with Annie and her f-buddy, the engagement party scene where Helen and Annie were trying to ""outfriend"" each other, the wedding scene at the end where Wilson Phillips was singing. Lillian outgrew Annie a long time ago and I think the movie would have been more realistic if they'd realized that and Annie was not part of the wedding at the end. But Melissa McCarthy was totally awesome. Every scene that she was in was perfect. I didn't like the movie, but I watched it twice just to see Melissa in action. I would have rated this movie one star, but I gave it an extra star because of Melissa."
3,Movei - Brides Maids,Received on time - good price. Movie sucked.... I guess I was expecting something as funny as the one with the guys (can't remember name) where they lose the groom.I will rate delivery and price a 5 star.
3,Surprised at the rave reviews!,"I wanted to like this movie...I had heard awesome things about it, and how hysterical it was. I loved The Hangover, Knocked Up, and other recent movies with similar raunchy humor. I can laugh with the best of them when it comes to potty humor--but this one just didn't do it for me. There was a depressing overtone with Kristen Wiig's character that brought the humor down a notch. The funny scenes were way over done--the food poisoning scene in particular, and the driving up and down the street to get the cop's attention. I did get a few chuckles out of the movie, but I don't think it lived up to the hype. A lot of people compared this to The Hangover--and my response to that--not in the least!"
5,Time to party!,"Bridesmaids starring Kristen Wiig is definitely worth all the hype! Mostly movies that get a lot of attention like this one did during the summer; I tend to hate but Bridesmaids is one of the funniest films of 2011! Wiig is a freakin' genius at what she does and she also co-wrote this comedy as well. The scene on the airplane is priceless and I love how this film has some depth to it, Wiig's character Annie is someone you can't help but idenitfy with and root for. I love, love, love this movie! I highly recommend it, enjoy!"
2,Bridesmaids,"Can't say if this is the ""female HANGOVER"" since I haven't seen the latter yet, but I doubt I'd like it any better. I guess I'm just not a fan of ""awkward situation"" comedy; I much prefer laughing over cringing. The parts I thought were kinda cute went on far too long. The rest was just super predictable. The British sibling roommates were funny, sort of. Poor Jill Clayburgh, what a depressing swan song. 4/10"
3,ok but not great,It was funny at times. But it wasnt great. I was so excited to see it when i saw commercials but now seeing it I am not overally thrilled about it. I wouldnt watch it again.
5,Hilarious,My girlfriends and I went see this for girls night. We laughed till it hurt!!! We looked at the women in our group and were able to match ourselves to each of the bridesmaids lol.Perfect for a night of drinking and story retelling with your girls. :)
2,So disappointed!,"With the great reviews this movie received I was so excited to see it so I pre-ordered the DVD. I was so disappointed in the entire movie... the cast (except for Melissa McCarthy) were not funny, the characters were not funny and the story was not funny! I kept thinking when is it going to get going... well it never did. The funniest lines/scenes were shown in the commercials."
1,Terrible,"This is most likely the least funny movie I have ever seen. Save your money. And your time.I love HUMOR. Of all types. Including modern extreme humor.This movie simply isn't funny. It relies on the ""humor"" of idiocy, self-indulgence, and emotional disturbance."
1,What did the reviewers see in this movie?,"I saw the reviews on Amazon, 3 of 5. But I read a several ""best of 2011"" articles where critics listed Bridesmaids as one of the funniest movies of the year.What kind of crack where they smoking when they watched it?There are a few funny parts but over all it's just excruciating. The main character, Annie, is not sympathetic at all and without that the movie has really nothing going for it.skip this one."
1,-1 Star. Another awful SNL movie.,"Kristen Wiig simply doesn't have what it takes to be a movie actress. She was very funny in some of her earlier work with SNL, but now she's just stupid.Maya Rudolph is also really bad in this movie. Maya used to be funny, but now she acts like she's a hottie and that's very weird because she is quite ugly.I kept skipping thru it for what seemed like forever and the movie was still not even close to ending. It's over two hours long.Something that made no sense to me about this movie was all the british people or actors playing british people in the movie. Did that add anything? NO!This movie is very similar to the ones with Jason Sudeikis in them. Maybe they have fun making the movies, but I certainly had no fun watching them."
1,Overrated and Not Funny!,"I'm a woman and could not stop laughing at Superbad or Hangover, so it's not as if I don't have a funny bone. Unfortunately for me, this movie totally missed the marked. It was a total disappointment, especially after all the glowing reviews. There were gross moments but not funny at all and the women characters had no chemistry amongst them. I found the women characters covered the range of pathetic women stereotypes and did not seem genuine. I'd expect this kind of writing from male writers but disappointed from female writers.I know this is not Shakespeare and was not looking for that, but even as an escapist comedy, the sad fact was the movie was not funny! I had to fast forward parts of the DVD as I was so bored, but since I paid for it, felt like I should finish watching it. The best part of the movie involves the guy cop (actor from IT Crowd), he was funny and seemed a genuine character. That's the only thing I liked about this movie."
1,LOOK ELSE WHERE FOR ENTERTAINMENT,"I missed this in the cinemas, just saw it on blu ray, this has had terriffic reviews in the media and from people who have seen it. I must say i dont know why, it just dragged on. I just couldnt get into it, as a chick flick is was unconvincing, sure as hell was not funny (meant to be a comedy), most of it is boring and uncomfortable to watch. save your time and money on a better film."
3,Scratched Disc... ):,"My order came quickly, which was great! I was super excited to get my order. When I opened the box and grabbed the case, I could hear the disc moving around inside the case. When I opened the case, the disc was scratched all over. I am disappointed because it was a brand new, unopened DVD, and now it looks like I've had it for a couple years. Other than that, the service was great, and I know that the movie is great, as I've seen it before. I just wish product was handled better and checked when shipped."
3,Funny but overrated,"To say for a second that Bridesmaids is as funny as the Hangover is ridiculous. Bridesmaids was funny, but it was also kind of dark and depressing at some points. It didn't keep me laughing all the way through."
4,Laugh out loud funny,"I laughed throughout this hysterical movie featuring funny girl Kristin Wiig as the maid of honor struggling to support her best friend despite one debacle after another. Wiig is delightful as the sympathetic main character, Maya Rudolph is fabulous as the bride, and Rose Byrne delivers a brilliant performance as the obnoxious Miss Perfect who undermines the maid of honor, but Melissa McCarthy absolutely steals the show as the uncouth sister of the groom.There were times that the movie relied too much on crass humor for my tastes, but overall I loved this laugh out loud movie that easily made me forget all of my own petty worries for 125 whole minutes!"
4,Bridesmaids DVD,"I love the movie, but the DVD I bought freezes in 2 places. So, that's a bummer. I guess there's nothing to do about it."
3,No Digital Copy?,"I love this movie! But when I ordered this I expected to get the original copy, blue-ray copy and a digital copy. The DVD and blue ray DVD were in the package and the code for the digital copy was included as well. However, when I proceeded to redeem the digital copy I was sad to discover the code was expired weeks before I even ordered my product. I was very disappointed."
2,"Great Movie, but if your buying this blu-ray for the digital copy, dont do it.","I bought this copy of bridesmaids for two reasons, for the blu-ray and for the digital copy. When i opened the package today, the digital copy was expired.Love the movie, but if part of the package doesnt work anymore, i think amazon should state that."
3,Gained momentum,"At first this movie seemed to drag on and on. Once it got past the need to be a showcase for Kristin Wiig's comic genius, it finally picked up and became a story you could get into. There were a lot of hilarious moments (even in the slow beginning), and the characters were a lot of fun. I loved Kristin Wiig, of course, and Chris O'Dowd is my new favorite cop.All in all, this was a fun movie and made me laugh a lot. If only they had cut out about 30 minutes of it, it would have been highly recommended."
4,Funny movie!,"I had heard mixed reviews about this movie but I liked it very much. The girls made me laugh from the beginning to the end of the movie. Now, because I am a big time girl power, equal rights, and Tina Fey intellect lover, I wanted it to be just as funny as Hangover the original was. Sorry but it was not as entertaining as that awesome movie. I do feel like it is worth buying to add to your collection though. So on one of those depressing, rainy, cloudy, and nasty days pour a glass of wine, put in the movie, and get your laugh on."
3,The funny parts were in the previews,"The funniest parts of the movie were shown in the previews. I did not think that the movie was as funny as people said it was. There were some funny parts, but not many for a movie listed as a ""comedy.""7"
4,Good experience,"The product was in good condition and arrived in a timely manner. The movie was very enjoyable and funny. I would recommend it to both men and women. I bought a used copy, that played great my only bad thing to say is that the movie was a rental and it is printed on the front cover of the DVD. I wish there had been a notice that at least told you this would be the case."
3,rather overrated,"It had its amusing moments, its downright funny moments even, but it didn't live up to the hype for me. Some of the meant to be hilarity was just painfully embarrassing. The characters were fine, but no great chemistry between any of them. I'm glad I waited for one of amazon's rental specials to watch it."
5,Best comedy of the year!,"Yes this may seem a total chick-flick but its really not! Its the funniest movie i seen this past year, the girls from SNL did an amazing job(coming from a manly man!)"
2,Overrated,Its a very very overrated movie. I thought it would be funny from beginning to end. I started dozing after....10 minutes. It does have some funny scenes (Melissa Mccarthy) and it does have some touching moments...but other than that...it was very bla. I wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to anyone.
1,Kiosk Rating <1,"Chick flick appealing to guess who for the following reasons:Reasons presented in ""Bridesmaids"":(1.) Female insecurity showcased with lots, of shopping, eating, swearing and girlfriend breakups.(2.) Women pursuing the perfect marriage but ending up feeling trapped; multiple examples.(3.) Implied sex scenes revealing that it's not uncommon for it not living up to the girl fantasy.(4.) Female mutual jealousy and competitive envy cat fights.(5.) Female bipolar/manic depression alternating between hysterical and slovenly episodes.(6.) Whether showing women social drinking or individually it was all formula stereotypical.Basically, just dumb jokes and even dumber slapstick. It is a bit of a concern that a significant number of Americans look forward to these TV soap-as-film reruns. It's just another in an endless stream of LA/NY rewrites for an established audience. Note; Not that the guys don't have their formula flicks."
1,No Digital Copy,"I was very concerned to discover the digital copy I was led to believe I would own as a result of purchasing the blu-ray + DVD + digital copy version of Bridesmaids, was already expired. I took having the digital copy into account before deciding to purchase this title on Amazon.com If I were making that decision now, I would not have purchased it. I am not happy that I am not able to enjoy the digital version of the title I was led to think I would have."
2,If you are expecting another HANGOVER style comedy then THIS IS NOT IT`,"I was told that this is a ""HANGOVER"" style comedy and boy was I told wrong.Well ok, it MIGHT be a ""HANGOVER"" style comedy for those individuals who watch WAM and LIFETIME movie network. Otherwise NOPE!If you don't set your expectations beyond a mid range comedy then it's ok but if you rent it with hopes to be as entertained as while watching ""Hangover"" then this is not even close. If you are looking for Hangover like comedy watch TOMCATS.This is written from late 20's male perspective."
1,Stupid,"Very, very sorry I paid good money to see this movie; the word 'stupid' is all that comes to mind. My cousin and I watched for about 30-40 minutes then couldn't take any more. It's an insult to the intelligence, NOT funny, juvenile, and the catty relationship between the protagonist and another bridesmaid (the bride's husband's bosses wife) is just embarassingly sophomoric. Save your money and your time."
1,Big disappointment,"While this movie was recommended to us by a number of people, we couldn't help wondering if they saw a different movie.Few laughs and far in between. The main character are utterly disappointing and boring to the point that after one hour we were wondering when it starts to get funny. The build up is just terrible and does not create a connection with the characters. The plot is disappointing and basically a less than entertaining love story with random weirdness in between.The character of the social awkward sister was played best in strong reference to her counterpart in the hangover. All other characters are not even worth the comparison.Don't watch this movie if you expect anything like the hangover."
1,Just Bad....,This is just a bad bad bad movie...if this is the best women get then we are getting shafted. Very few funny parts and I want my time back :)
1,very disappointed,"I waited anxiously for this movie to come out on dvd, as it is hard for me to go to theaters with young kids in the house. I am always eager to have a laugh, and I am not too sophisticated for low-brow and slap-stick humor, really, anything will do. This movie was just sad, and the parts that were supposed to be funny were just awkward. I do not understand what other people thought was funny."
4,wow,This was one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. Think Hnagover but for women. If you have ever gotten married or have helped plan a wedding then you will thouroughly enjoy this comedy.
2,"Gross, depressingly un-funny movie","This is a gross-out men's comedy movie with a chick-flick synopsis. If disgusting, perverted, slapstick embarrassment humor is the thing for you, you'll love this movie. I, however, look for comedy stories where the characters still have their dignity in the end."
1,Terrible I can not imagine why they call this a comedy???,A skeptical to reviews i bought this movie...thank god i bought it used instead of new! I can not beleive all the rave reviews and how this is like sex and the city meets the hangover. It should be every actor in this movie deserves to be hanged!! This is terrible there were no funny scenes!!! Just alot of waste of film! Save your money and go have drinks at a pity bar and watch catty women feel sorry for themselves it's the same as this movie minus the waste of money!! Definitley not Funny!!!! i'm giving it a star because that is the lowest acceptable rating!
1,Worst movie ever,"This is the by far the worst movie I have ever seen. They hype about it and the reviews all said that it was a great movie and very funny. I feel like I either saw a different movie or I saw the unfunny version, because it was far from great and not funny at all. It is being compared to the Hangover which I thought was hysterical and laughed throughout it. I just don't understand the high marks and reviews for this movie. I am usually pretty forgiving with movies as long as they entertain me, but I could not find anything worthwhile in this movie. I definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone. If you are on the fence about renting it or buying it, don't do it. There are better ways to spend 2 hours and much better movies out there."
1,If there was a half star rating this is the movie for it,"It's a bad version or rather worse version of ""The Hangover"" for women...... my wife and I managed to make it to the one hour thirteen min mark and that was painful as we had hopes of it getting more funny instead of more juvenile. If your a 20 something bathroom humor kind of girl this is the movie for you. If your a guy good luck to ya buddy, BYOB. The movie suffers from a-typical humor to where you know the nextr thing that will happen like a machine gun rattling off jokes, then a total slow down where you feel the movie is supposed to generate a story, but it only does that like it generates humor - in a poorly executed way. I would rather watch Steve Martin in Father of The Bride - 500 times in a row rather than another 5 min of this uhhh movie."
1,Hangover what???,"Hahaha...someone is really high...I mean how can you compare this to the Hangover or to anything good really!This movie was not interesting at all. Some people say the best thing was Melissa McCarthy, but I actually found her unfunny and gross."
1,I wish I could get my money back,"I hated this movie. It is overrated. If this is the funniest movie of the year, well then I'm just going to stop watching movies because this wasn't funny at all.It feels like one of the reality bad girls tv shows, except suppose to be funny. This movie wasn't even so bad that it was good.It just was horrible. I rank this in the top 5 of the worst movies ever."
1,Seriously Disappointing,"This was supposed to be a COMEDY? Most of it was depressing. NONE of it was interesting. I'm the kind of person who finds humor in every day life, but could not find humor in this movie. Not only did I not laugh, I never even SMILED. The worst part? I rented it because of how great the reviews were. HUUUUUGE waste of time and money."
1,I.Q. 40,"Movie about people with I.Q 40 for audience with I.Q. 40. Is this what Americans consider ""funny""? I have neverseen anything equally stupid."
3,I thought this was a comedy????,"I enjoyed the movie, but I didn't laugh, not once during the entire film. People compared this to the girl version of The Hangover, some even said it was funnier, that comparison is ridiculous, this movie is nothing more than a woman who feel really bad about herself performing self-degrading acts and failing at life. The problem with this movie, is that the parts that were supposed to be funny, I just found myself feeling sorry for the main character, who is over 30 and acts like she's 15. There is nothing hilarious or comedic about this entire movie. The entire movie is like watching to see how the main character will fail...again. Only to have her ""win"" in the end...but what has she really won...after 30 some years apparently how to act mature for the final 4 minutes of the movie. Another reviewer said female comedies were just not that funny, I don't agree, I just think don't consider this movie a very well written comedy or for that matter a funny movie at all."
3,Very funny at times but also crude,"There were some SUPER funny scenes in this movie, like the tennis match, the brazilian luncheon aftermath and the airplane scene. But it was quite crude in some spots, not a fan of that, not sure if I will watch it again."
2,Could have been better,"Very disappointed in this movie. Poor quality of acting, along with a poorly constucted script line. Glad I did not go to the theaters for this one. I really love Melissa McCarthy in ""Mike and Molly"" But, this movie did not do her any justice. It could have been much better. I suggest ""Revenge of the Bridesmaids"" Very Hilarious!!"
2,2 hour SNL skit that won't quit,"I'd heard such wonderful things about this movie that I jumped at the chance to rent it for only .99 through Amazon's Video on Demand. About 30 minutes into it, I started to worry. The movie was advancing so slowly that it felt like a drawn out SNL skit that wouldn't end. Things did get a little better and I smiled two or three times by the end of it. If you really like Kristen Wiig or Maya Rudolph, you might enjoy this. However, as a weekly viewer of SNL, I failed to laugh out loud even once."
2,Not very funny - lots of bodily fluid humor for the modern SNL viewers,Watched this as a $1 rental and wanted my money back after watching it. I am not a big fan of the current saturday night live (SNL_ TV show - I just don't find it very funny. This movie is like a giant SNL sketch but with swearing. It does have a few interesting moments but nothing made me laugh. I'd suggest avoiding this unless you are a big fan of the modern day SNL.
4,Surprise--it's good!,"Not being a fan of corporate movie offerings, I watched this expecting to be disappointed. I was--but not in a bad way! I was dissapointed that a corporate movie was better than most of the smaller films I gravitate to. Very good and unexpected."
5,Awesome!!!,"So SO FUNNY!!!!! Great fun to watch, not just a chick flick. Shared it with the family and they loved it too."
4,TOO Funny!,This is SUCH a funny movie. Kristin Wiig is BRILLIANT! The whole cast is great. Do NOT miss this movie.
2,mediocre,"Uninspired and plain boring for long stretches, this movie seems to think extended vomit scenes are the pinnacle of humour. and stunt driving. and running a joke into the ground austin powers 3 style.The only good thing about it was Melissa McCarthy, she was funny and genuine. Otherwise it was a total waste of time."
2,the movie was toooooo slow,so I watched the movie and I skipped half it. It was to slow and if I skipped a couple of tracks I still got the movie.
2,OK... but,"So much hype about this movie I was expecting to laugh my other end off. Didn't. OK movie, some funny scenes but sorry I actually bought it. Renting would have done the trick."
2,Bridesmaids,"This was a have to have on my list due to my friends recommendation. They were wrong. Maybe I have seen too many times Kristen on SNL. My husband and I both didn't think it was funny. We kept waiting for the funny parts. I know I am in the minority on this movie, but I ended up giving the movie to a friend that loves it!"
1,Why not join the 21st century?,"Movie is great and well worth the watch, this a review on this packaging.They should not make Blu Ray/DVD combos in DVD packaging anymore, its a new format it has its own style and yet they offer more plastic for no reason.I blame Disney for this trend since they offer it on most of their re-released titles, but you can't expect to get all your blu-rays this way so why not convert and just order the properly made, Blu-ray in Blu-ray packaging.That said awesome movie very funny and had a nice message to it with some very funny ladies, buy it in the right packaging, please."
1,low level comedy,the movie is so so....better to say it can be understand only by women cause the movie consists just of women's humor
1,Terrible,It's really hard to get into a movie when the lead character has zero redeeming qualities. This whole movie was just terrible. It never even felt like it got started. Don't waist your time.
1,"Watch the trailer, it has all the good parts","Cannot begin to explain how bad this movie is. What astonished me is Ebert, NY Times and so many gave it high praise. The movie plods slowly, is not that well acted and you keep waiting for it to pick up. It is nothing like the trailer makes it out to be, a Hangover movie for/about women. The puke scene is just gross and sad and on and on. I really have not come across a movie that was so well received when in fact it was really awful.If you watch the trailer and a few clips, really that is all the good parts right there."
2,Bridesmaids,"I was very disappointed in this movie. It could have been very funny, but the CONSTANT use of the f-word really turned me off. Totally unnecessary."
2,We're the minority - hubby & I barely laughed,"After hearing friends repeatedly gush over how hilarious this movie was, I was very excited to finally rent the movie after patiently waiting several sold-out weekends at the rental kiosk. I was sadly disappointed.We found scenes either cheesy or pitiful (granted, she was depressed, alright). Laughed at loud at the bridal store scene & speed-trapping with the cop. I found the airplane & meltdown scene very cringe-worthy, not funny at all. The best part of the movie was the cop - he was well-written, even my husband liked him as a hero.Thank goodness I rented it for $1. Had more laughs with The Change-Up, the next movie we popped in after this one. And I was disappointed that they did not wear the dresses that's on the DVD cover - at least not on the DVD (theatrical) version that we rented."
3,Men.. Don't be fooled!!,"While I must admit that this movie had many laugh out loud scenes, it was a chick flick by the numbers. Let me count the ways...1) Sex with no nudity.2) Gushy ""feel good"" song.3) Good guy vs. bad boy conflict.4) ""Hot mess"" female lead.5) uptight female antagonistDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie. But to compare this in any way to the Hangover is very misleading."
3,It's not so crazy as true~!,You have to give this one a chance to build up the characters. And don't be too quick to prejudge their efforts. I can just imagine the real world of ladies gone a little bit crazy really behaving like this.
2,Disappointing with very few funny parts,"The story moved slow, the main characters were unsympathetic and there were not enough funny parts to keep the movie interesting. The movie got bogged down in self pity for way too long and was depressing at points. This is not the female version of ""The Hangover"". For all those who said that must not have actually watched ""The Hangover"", as that movie was actually funny."
3,It's OK,"There's a lot of awkward scences that makes you feel embarassed for the characters. Bits and pieces of good laughs here and there, but not much. Typical cheesy comedy romance storyline."
1,Bad bad bad was so boring that we did not finish it. Save your money.,Bad bad bad was so boring that we did not finish it. Save your money. We are so glad we did not go to the theater to see this drivel.
1,Very unfulfilled,"I was hoping that this movie would be funny as the previews had some good lines, but am disappointed. The movie does have a couple good one liners, but they are stretched between painfully whiny dialogue that goes on forever."
1,Boy did that suck,"My wife so this in the theater and walked out halfway through but figured after all the good reviews maybe she missed something so we rented it for me to see for the first time and her to give another shot. She was so right the first time. This movie is terrible. It has a few funny parts and yes Melissa McCarthy is great but the rest of the cast just isn't funny and the movie is awkward and flat for the majority of the film. I don't understand for the life of me what the hype was about. Awful, awful movie."
1,Tell me what part was funny,"For all of you that said you laughed during this ""movie"", what specific scene, joke, etc... did you find funny? This film is not funny, not one bit, not at all. I shouldn't be surprised, after all, Judd Apatow was involved with the movie."
1,HORRIBLE,"What a awful movie, so not funny. Do people really act this way? The actors looked miserable, like they coundn't believe they were performing this! Choose another movie."
3,its ok,We have to skip scene 13 because it locks up at that point and wont play anymore. Other than that it appears to be in great shape. I did not contact the seller because its more of a hassle than its worth for a $10 movie!
2,The best parts were shown in the previews...,Everyone that I knew who saw this movie said it was hilarious. The reviews compared it to The Hangover. Talk about a waste of time. This movie is not even in the same league as the Hangover. All of the funny scenes were shown in the previews. I'm glad I borrowed this movie from a friend instead of wasting $25 for it.
3,Not as Funny as I Expected it to Be,"I went into this movie with high hopes. I'd been told that it was like a female version of The Hangover. Not even close. The characters were likeable enough, and there were some really funny bits but, on a whole, the laughs were far and few between. Also, a great deal of what the main character went through was really sad."
1,Why did I watch this,A few funny parts but not worth the time. I watched it via red box and I was upset I wasted a $1 and 2 hours of my life.
1,say away,"what a waste of time, we kept thinking it will get better. but let us save you the time it doesnt."
1,"Dumb, dumb and dumber","Stupid, stupid, dumb, dumb and dumb. Wish I had not spent the $4.99 on renting it.You might want to check out reviews by viewers older then 12. IMO"
1,Brides maids,I wasn't impressed with the movie and only watched the first 10 minutes passed the opening credits. Not one i'd recommend to my friends
1,Awful movie and the humor is made for teenage boys.,"If you are into smart, independent and strong-female lead then this movie is NOT for you. There is not witty-humor, not unforgettable moments, not tongue in the cheek humor, just plain out GROSS, inmature and out of place humor.Then again, if The Hangover if your type of movie, and bowel movements, throwing up and other body fluids segregation if your thing, then by all means knock yourself out.As for me, I just want my two hours back. :p"
2,Typically overhyped drivel.,"I don't usually buy comedy movies because the're just not funny unless you have a ""thing"" for toilet humor, this garbage is no exception, 1 or 2 funny moments, that's about it. If you must see this, rent it, save your money for something better, which won't be hard to do."
2,Yuck,"This movie is incredibly overrated. The pacing is off, the main character unlikeable, and the story was dull. My wife and I were disappointed."
1,Disappointing,"Fell into the hype surrounding this movie and went in expecting it to be along the lines of Wedding Crashers or an instant classic like Old School. I was mistaken and there is almost nothing in this movie that is funny or that hasn't been seen on SNL. Hugely disappointing especially when they were heading to Las Vegas...at that point in the movie I had expected it would pick up and actually be worthwhile, but all we get is a somber bus trip back to Chicago...complete dud of a movie. Really? Females vomitting???"
1,BAD,Worst movie ever.I would not recommend this movie to anyone.Waste of my time. Wish I could have my money back.
1,"Really, really bad.","The movie is titled ""Bridesmaids"". Perhaps if they focused the movie on the bridesmaids (especially the great Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper, who are fantastic actresses with way too little screen time in this movie) it would've been funny. Honestly, I don't think I laughed, or at least smirked, once."
1,Garbage... Depressing !!,"When I started seeing this movie yesterday, I already felt let down by the initial scene, where a woman is an object to a man who doesn't give a damn about her. Still, I insisted on watching it because I really felt things would get better and something good would finally be made out of this senseless objectification, but to my real astonishment, things went from the frying pan into the fire, and the film reached an unbearable non-sense!! I could understand if a man told me that he liked this garbage, as this is culturally understandable, but a woman?? Really?? To like such disgusting trash!!!??? I have to live ten lives to grasp the idea of a woman thinking this depressing film is funny. I got sad after watching it."
1,Extremely Vulgar,How on earth was this garbage nominated for any awards? This was incredibly vulgar. A complete waste of 123 minutes of my life that I will never get back.
4,"good movie for women, alright for guys","If you are a guy you will think this movie is pretty good and a little funny. If you are a girl, you will love this movie and think it is really funny."
5,"LOVED It -- Raunchy, Real... and Kind of Uplifting","First, this movie is not for the faint of heart. It's crude, crass, and rather juvenile. But it's all done in a very funny way and at the center of the movie is a message about ""holding on"" (a la Wilson Philips) and learning to love yourself. I usually hate comedies, as I think most of the ones made in Hollywood these days are so NOT funny. But this one pleasantly surprised me. Highly recommended. Might even buy it instead of just renting!"
5,Sincerly,"I got this for 5 dollars that was a great deal. Its a funny romantic movie, It works great,great, great"
2,Not worth the time,"Movie was not good. Stupid jokes, very little actual comedy. Don't waste precious hours of your life watching this mess."
4,Umm...,"So, half of me thinks this movie is disgusting and horrible. I seriously wanted to give many of those involved a good shake. Yet, between the revulsion and annoyance, I found the movie hilarious.Not quite The Hangover funny, but funny. As a girl, I also found it strangely accurate about how crazy people can get during weddings. That thing with one bridesmaid trying to supplant the maid of honor? Happened at my last wedding.I actually think it's a good movie to watch with the newly engaged. Does that make me mean?"
4,Bridesmaids,"I had no idea that Mya Rudolph could be serious. Melissa McCarthy stole the movie in her scenes. Kristin Wiig (?) played her part with just the right amount of angst and laid-backness. The funniest part was the wedding dresss fitting. Great cast choices. Lorne Michaels puts some great talent out there, but of course they have to stand on their own and these girls do it.Vickie V."
4,Brides Maids,This movie arrived in the specified time and was really funny. Thank you for the movie which was enjoyed by all.
2,Duped again...,I was looking forward to seeing this movie and was really disappointed. Clearly all of the raves were an indication of a severe lack of good movies at the time that Bridesmaids was released. Video quality and sound was good.
2,Disappointing,I thought this movie was incredibly disappointing...I wouldn't bother to pay to watch this. Wait for it to be free.
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE,"It was on my Christmas wishlist but I couldn't wait any longer. Ordered, watched, and laughed my butt off. If you're going in to this movie thinking Hangover movie, don't watch it, it's not THAT hilarious. I love how it's hot pink case stands out amongst my other DVDS :)"
4,"Hard to watch, FUNNY!",This is a really funny movie but I hate it at the same time. It's one of those where you feel so bad for some of the characters you really don't want to watch. Or you hate some of the characters so you don't want to watch. But in the end it is so funny you watch it. It's a must see at least once. Not sure you want to own it though....
5,Bridesmaids,I bought this tape for myself because I saw it at my niece's house and laughted so hard that I had to get it and watch it again with my husband.
1,not worth it,"for all the hype this movie received, we were looking forward to watching it. then we started to watch it, such a let down. had some funny moments, but not enough."
1,Damaged,"So this review is about the actual DVD I received, not the movie itself. Once I got about halfway through the movie, the picture pretty much just stopped and the audio started skipping around. I checked the disc every time and there are absolutely no scratches, no dirt, nothing. And it stops in the exact same spot every time. I don't understand how this could possibly have happened but it tells me that these DVDs must have come from a shady source."
1,Very stupide movie!,"Bad acting, idiotical manusscript, boring, boring, boring! Has no common with the ""Hangover"", so, no false comparations, please! Don't waste time and money in this."
1,Horrible movie,"Just rented and tried to watch this movie. After 20 minutes we couldn't take it any more and turned it off. This is NOT a family movie. The first 5 minutes is a sex scene, which is not at all what we were expecting, based on the trailers. The dialog is terrible, foul, and mostly sex related. Real women don't talk that way, especially at an engagement party. Our daughter watched the whole thing, and she didn't like it either. The only thing she found funny was the wedding dress scene, where the bride looked like a puff ball. The humor, when you can find it, is the sort of stuff high-school boys find amusing, like barfing, passing gas, and diarrhea. Worst movie we've seen in years."
1,what laughs?,"this movie was not funny at all. i did not laugh at alllllll. this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life. if this is the standard of todays humor, then please take me back 20 or 30 years ago."
1,The unbearable impecility on public viewing,"dullness of mind, absurdity, apathy, asininity, battiness, brainlessness, doltishness, fatuity, fatuousness, feeble-mindedness, idiocy, ignorance, imbecility, imprudence, incapacity, ineptitude, injudiciousness, insensibility, lunacy, nitwittedness, nonsense, obtuseness, puerility, shallowness, silliness, simplicity, slowness, slowness, sluggishness, stolidity, stupefaction, stupidness, stupor, thick-headedness, weak-mindedness, weakness..."
1,Boring and just a complete waste of time,"I just cant believe anyone would find this movie funny. I am a 32 year old female and i thought it was completely boring and kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen. The bathroom scene everyone says is hysterical could have been done 200% better. I guess i have seen to many of these scenes because i didnt laugh one bit. Want to see a gross bathroom scene watch Trainspotting, the toilet scene. The part where the main character poos in her wedding dress in the street, watch Spud in trainspotting where he pooed on himself. Anyway I have no idea how this movie did so well or why they would be thinking of making a sequel. Also i dont get why the cover of them is different from what they actually wore in the wedding, its just weird. Do NOT waste your $3.99 like i did!"
1,not likeable,"vulgar, gross and I never wanted to root for the main character. She has a personality I do not approve of"
1,Terrible Movie,Saw this on the plane during an international flight. Glad I didn't pay money for it. If I had known the choice was this or watching the drool fall from the lip of the sleeping people across the aisle. Drool would have won.
5,Laughed so Hard!!!!,"This was a great movie, we all laughed so hard!!! It is not just a chick flick, the boyfriend loved it too!!!"
4,Not a Chick Flick...It's Just Funny!,This was a very funny movie. Almost as funny as Hangover and Hangover 2. If you like slapstick comedy...check it out. Makes me wonder if women really have weddings like this one.
1,AWFUL!!!!!,"I thought this movie was going to be a female version of The Hangover although I have to say that there was nothing funny about these women. It was slow and uneventful. I quit laughing at the beginning of the movie when the main charactger left her ""boyfriend's"" house and got stuck on the fence. Downhill at that point. Save your money and see something else. If I could rate it -5, I would!"
2,Not so much.,"There were some funny moments. However, most of the time my husband and I just looked at each, ""did they really say that,"" ""did they really do that?"" I am not a prude, but too many F-bombs. You CAN be funny without too much bad language and disgusting behavior. I thought this was more like toilet humor. Maybe this was a hit with the younger crowd and will become a cult classic. Funny to me? Not so much."
2,Not one of the guys,"This is not a guy movie, if you want to share with your couple, look for the ugly truth or friends with benefits."
1,A sad sad commentary on the flight from feminism.,"This is a Debbie Reynolds or Doris Day comedy from the 1950s ""updated"" by adding fart and vomit jokes. Either Kristen Wiig and her writing partner are cynical to a degree that should shame even Hollywood, or they lack intelligent, close friends. Had men written this reactionary, misogynistic nonsense, women would have rightly been up in arms. But, apparently Sex in the City has made it all right to once again portray women as lost, self-hating harridans until they are redeemed by marriage to a sweet, sexy, but safe, male provider.Perhaps, next, Judd Apatow and company can do a comic take on the Protocols of the Elders of Zion -- with, of course, fart and vomit jokes. I mean, if it's all about making money, why not?"
1,Absolute Trash,"NO STARS at all on this work for the waste bin.....when the big trashy girl sat on the sink to crap, I hit the eject button, and took this waste of time and money back to the video store. Good thing I did not get in on N-flicks, it would have stuck up my mail box. Sorry to all the actors who could not possibly have been in this humorless tripe for anything but a pay check."
1,I couldn't get pass the first 30 minutes!,Watch the movie trailer. It won't cost you a think and it has to be the best parts of the movie. Horrible movie.
1,Kristen Wiig continues her unblemished track record,"In the movie ""Bridesmaids"", Kristen Wiig keeps her unblemished track record alive as she continues to show why she's the most unfunny performer on the small and large screen.I use the word ""performer"" to describe Kristen Wiig's job skills because the titles ""actress"" and ""comedian"" are typically reserved for those who can actually act or for those who are actually funny. Wiig certainly does not fit into either of those two categories.""Bridesmaids"" has the honor of being listed in my top five worst movies of all time list.Truly a pathetic movie."
2,A few funny moments but,"Its lead character was poorly chosen. Its one of those movies that I was told was really funny and then my wife and I were deciding to go to bed or not after about 30 minutes. Another test the friendship, stressed out, over the top made of honor movie. We thought the cop and the larger girl with all the puppies were good."
1,depressing movie,"I couldn't help but hear the buzz this summer about Bridesmaids being the movie to see. I honestly can't figure out why the reviewers thought it was good more or less great.The movie is depressing, the main character keeps thinking she's hit rock bottom but then something worse happens. There was a lot of crude humor and after 45 minutes, I wanted to have an intervention with these ladies, they need some help. The only movie that made me cringe in horror more times was Dinner with Schmucks. I guess I just don't get the comedy of watching another person's crappy life for 2 hours."
2,waste of $$$$,it wasn't even that funny and it was helllllllllllla long for not being that funny for 2hr and some change
2,dont buy. rent first!,"movie sucked!! jus sayin. this was a waste of money!!!!!!! the only reason i bought it was bc everyone said it was such a good movie and that it was funny. umm, yea. nope not at all! not even a little."
3,Bridesmaids,The best/funniest parts were in the trailer. It was cheaper to buy than see in the theater. I'm thankful for that. I would have been disappointed if I would have spent the money for the theater.Bridesmaids
5,HILARIOUS!,If you haven't seen this movie you're missing out. I wish there were more smart comedies for women. Also see Pitch Perfect.
2,Digital copy is a head ache,"I purchased this movie as a gift, thought it would be cool to have a digital copy on the tablet as well, but it is truly a headache to mess with.The only way I can tell to view the digital copy is with a computer, which is stupid. Almost every computer now has a dvd/ bluray drive so why even mess with it? This kind of DRM is why bootleggers exist. Poor execution."
5,Bridesmaids DVD,Bridemaids was my favorite movie. Laughed all the way through it! I could watch it over and over again. I highly recommend it.
4,Funny & heartwarming!,"Although some of the bits went on too long, this was a cute and funny movie! The cast was perfect and the laughs were many!"
5,Easy 5 stars!,"With a movie this good giving it only 5 stars doesn't seem to do it justice but most people who have seen it already know that. Loved this movie and cannot wait to get it. This package comes with the blu-ray, reg. dvd and a digital copy-you'd be crazy not to buy this! Hilarious feel good movie!"
2,No Thanks,"I love Kristen Wiig, so I was excited to see this movie, but now I wish I had the 2 hours and 11 minutes of this movie back. 2 stars for being painful to watch (mostly Kristen's character) and having gross humor for the sake of being an ""adult comedy."" I didn't give it 1 star because I did like Megan and Rhodes--good characters, but not enough to redeem the other ones."
2,Where's the funny?,"This movie is a great example of Hollywood hype. Not only was it not funny, it was depressing! Kristen Wigs character Annie Walker was so depressing I became totally bummed out. There were no resolves to issues. Okay, Annie found a great guy but that is it. What about the issues brought up by the bridesmaids on the plane? The only thing I liked were the puppies. They were (of course) super cute.This was also very disappointing because there were a lot of good people in the movie. I first saw Chris O'Dowd in the I.T. Crowd. Great Brit show. It was nice to see Jill Clayburgh again. Too bad the movie was the pits! This is why I do not go to the movies anymore. It is better to lose $4 than $10 or more. What an all around waste!"
3,"OK Film, but more crass than it needs to be.","Bridesmaids is a little more crass than I would have liked. I'm not a prude, but it detracts from the humor. I bother leaving this as a review because I think some readers might not realize that the humor is not just sexual, but pretty gross. Watch out for the gross stuff."
2,Too Many Droughts,"It's probably a good rule of thumb to not set expectations too high, and instead be pleasantly surprised.I am guilty of doing that here, as with all the critical acclaim this film got my wife and I fully expected this to be a girl's versionof THE HANGOVER.Uh, it's not.While the film does have some painfully funny moments, it also has very long stretches that are not only not funny but totally depressing.Kristen Wiig can be hilarious and infuriating, which shows a terrific range, but it doesn't make you like her character - which ultimatelymakes the unfunny moments in this film (and there are MANY) feel like a sharp stick in the eye.If you are interested in a dramedy, this is for you. If you are looking for straight laughs, it's not."
5,Even men laugh at this movie,"The title scares men --- oh no, not another one of THOSE girl movies. But the men are laughing loudest at this movie with so many surprisingly funny scenes."
3,Bridesmaids,It was ok. Not as good as expected. Some parts are funny and the actors were great. Humor is a little questionable and not for children.
5,"Fast, funny, and for less","Movie arrived by the time it was supposed to. Gave it as a present and ended up watching the movie as well. Movie was great, no scratches, perfect. Thanks"
3,chic flick,"it ws pretty funny but not exactly what i thought it would be, it was reccommended to me by someone who thought it was super funny, just shows you can't go by another's opinion. worth watching"
5,ount on laughs,One of the best videos for 16 yr olds and older. It has become a family favorite for laughs and great comedic timing
2,Terrible!,The first 30 minutes or so is hilarious. After that the characters slip into BAD overacted versions of SNL. Couldn't finish it. Really bad.
1,Blah,"This was one of those movies that looked alot better on the tv trailers then the movie was itself. I bought it strictly for Melissa McCarthy, two of us watched this and we both said it wasnt that great. Starting off with a sex scene 2 seconds into the movie was bad taste in my opinion."
5,Funny show!,Hilarious to watch alone or with a bunch of friends for a mellow girls night without kids or significant others around!
5,FUNNY,"This movie was LOL funny, even my husband enjoyed it. I bought this on sale during christmas time and I am so glad that I did. Can't wait to watch it over and over."
3,Good performance,"You can sure see why the costar is up for the award. Can't think of her name. I don't think they meant for her character to be that outstanding, but she stole the show with her acting ability. You could really feel what she was going for. Loved her but didn't care about the plot."
1,Festering Garbage,"I started watching this only because it had some buzz at the Oscar ceremonies, but found it unwatchable after 10 minutes, as it was an infantile, solid mass of cliche, poorly written, acted, conceived, shot, edited, and imagined, and with loathesome cartoonish characters. I can't say if it was the worst film I've seen in ten years. But it could have been."
1,Should get 0 stars,"This was minimally funny and a HUGE disappointment. Incredibly depressing movie and unbelievably crass. Except for about 15 minutes throughout the movie, not funny AT ALL.Save your money and DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
1,Yuck!!,"If this isn't one of the worst movies I've ever seen, then it's close!Don't waste your money on this."
1,"NOT funny, just sad & misogynistic!!","I rented this movie based on the good reviews I'd heard. It was NOT funny, it was pathetic and very biased against women (at least young women). I didn't mind the grossness or lewdness, but it simply wasn't funny! And the poor best friend/maid of honor, Annie, was just an idiot. She had so little self-esteem that she was sleeping with a man who wouldn't even take her out to dinner first -- she was nothing but a ""booty call."" And then the bride-to-be basically sets up poor Annie to compete against the shallow rich bitch Helen. This movie portrays women as either stupid or mean. NOT recommended."
1,lowest common denomiator,so bad we stopped watching it after 20 minutes. watch anything else. it's not even good potty humor. waste of five bucks...maybe worth a netflix rental.
3,Bridesmaids Movie,"I was so disappointed in this movie. I kept waiting for the funny stuff, I remember really only laughing twice. After all the hooplah I expected more."
2,Just ok.,"This girl comedy is just ok. It's not more than that because the central character is brainless and brings her problems on herself. Some scenes are amusing, but for the most part it's all ho-hum."
2,Viewer's remorse,"I finally got this movie, largely because I'd heard how great and funny and wonderful it was. I found myself fast forwarding through whole chunks of it. I think I equate it with American Pie. If you like crude jokes, OTT pratfalls, characters behaving in a way that, if they were real, you'd walk away and write them off, you'll love it. :)As it was, like others have said, most of the funniest parts were in the previews.Overrated is a good term. This is one that's not going on my shelf, it'll be sold to my local reseller for someone else to have."
2,Not good,"I had got brides maids blu ray dvd and digital copy there was no digtal copy with it. Was not pleased with this,rather not get my movies from here."
2,Ugh. Too bad,"I had really high hopes for this one. The previews looked hilarious. Unfortunately, the comedians did not get so much more than a giggle out of me for the first 45 minutes. After that, I simply shut it off. It was boring for all the same reasons that I typically find most female comedians boring. They fell back on these concepts, which just aren't funny to me: putting themselves down, over exaggeration, and catty humor. Sadly, this is why I find most female comedians aren't funny. And I'm a woman, so I'm not being a sexist pig or anything.Concept was good. Timing off. Better luck next time."
2,over the top crass,"I am definitely not a prude, but this movie was one large mass of unnecessary bathroom, trash mouth ""humor"". I found the women to be disgusting in behavior for the most part, and there was nothing funny until near the end. It was a waste of time in my opinion. No acting. No real story. And not much of anything truly funny, unless you find your giggles in bad language."
1,ah!,"What a BAD, BAD movie this is.Please do not waste your money - get this empty and lame movie from the library for FREE."
1,Major Disappointment,"I am sorry to say, but I have no idea what all the hype was surrounding this film. Even considering the supposedly memorable moments proffered by the actress from ""Mike and Molly,"" I still did not care for it."
2,Really?,"What is all the fuss about this movie? I am very liberal minded and love all kinds of movies. In fact, when it comes to comedy, the more irreverant the better. I am, however, not particularly fond of the current trend of juvenile films that all seem to have one thing in common: How stupid and lame-brained can we make this movie? When ""Bridesmaids"" opened, it was an instant smash hit, it was on everyone's lips and ultimately garnered some award nominations. I figured it was going to be several cuts above the others. I watched it expecting to see something really funny. Instead what I saw was more of the same lame-brained crap. I am beginning to think that the popularity of dumb movies like this illustrates the declining intelligence of the population - particularly the Americsn population. As for awards nominations, How the hell did Melissa McCarthy get nominated for an Oscar? I mean... really?"
2,Big disappointment,"My wife and I watched this together. The movies had great potential. Strong cast and sharp writing. However, it never quiet delivered on any of it's promises. It was loose, seemed to drag and had very little that was truly unique. I felt the talent in the writing and look forward to more refined and funny movies from Whig in the future."
2,Terrible. Not funny.,"Not funny. The plot was senseless and the characters all seemed too old to be typically considered bride and bridesmaids. The lead character was so unlikable that I can't even remember her name. None of the female characters were likable, actually. The only reason I gave this two stars is because I liked the cop. I have no idea what he was supposed to have found charming and lovable about the selfish, trashy, drunken, 'maid' of honor. Oh, except at some point he apparently had bought cakes in a shop she'd owned, and thought she was a great baker."
5,Reliable & Quick!,I was super impressed on how quickly my dvd arrived. I ordered a used dvd and I was super happy with the results. This was my first time buying from Amazon and it was a easy and super positive experience!! :D
4,Women Behaving Badly,"I have to admit there were a few funny sequences in this movie. Acting badly is no longer the sole purview of men - these women are right up there on the gross scale. I always suspected women had it in them to be this bad. In the end it becomes more of a ""chick flick"", but it's one that most guys could tolerate. Not sure I'd want to watch it more than once though."
4,Loved it!,Hilarious fun with some depth. Watch it. You will not be disappointed. It's a great movie even for people who don't like stupid funny movies. You will be rolling on the floor laughing your ass off the entire time.
3,Bonus material not worth it,"The bonus material on the 2nd CD is not very good. Most of the live material sounds as if Alice Cooper was at the end of a long tour and Alice's voice was hoarse. I love the original album, of course, but that would have been enough. The couple of demos and non-live tracks are interesting but not good enough to justify buying the bonus package. Also, the booklet could have been better and told more about each of the album cuts, as well as the group."
5,Billion Dollar Babies,"If you lived back then, you understood Alice Cooper. This was his best. If you nevere heard it, give it a try."
4,Amazing Album From The Father Of Hard Shock Rock,"Alice Cooper undoubtedly started the shock rock movement. He shocked the world with his his on-stage antics and sometimes weird subject matter. He took heavy metal sounds and mixed them with the pop songs of the day. This was Cooper's most successful recording, and I think it is very good. The thing that kept it from being a 5 star recording is that the last two songs are quite bad. But other than that, I think this is one of the best albums of the 1970's. It is a hard rock classic."
4,Get the 2CD remastered issue instead.,"Billion Dollar Babies is not Alice Cooper's best album, but it is pretty close.But, you shouldn't buy this version of the CD. There is a newer version that has been remaster and contains two CD's. The second CD consists of fantastic live material and some very interesting studio outtakes. If you are any kind of Cooper fan, you should search out the newer version. It is his best CD release."
5,Outstanding Reproduction!,"This version of the Alice Cooper band classic album, Billion Dollar Babies is simply fantastic.The gatefold cover (complete with embossed baby's head coin on the front and back,) press out wallet photos, lyrics and band photo inner sleeve plus the famous giant billion dollar bill are all exactly how they should be. This product is the same as when the album was first released back in 1973.The vynal itself is thick and the labels are excellent reproductions. If you love vynal records, I strongly suggest you pick up one of these for your collection.A job very well done and hope that other Cooper band classic albums will also be included in this 180 gram collection, cheers!"
4,The Buck Stops Here,"Great Value: Take Alice's hardest rocking/most consistent LP, throw in the excitement of a near complete live show from the same era, include 2 outtakes and a B-side (the Elvis shtick is pretty funny)... and you've got the coolest Alice Cooper product on the market. I hope all the babies in the band (not just the lead singer) made a buck on this reissue."
2,Poor dvd audio sonicly,"Although the album is good, the dvd audio expectation was well below par. Compared to other dvd audios this is edgy, bass is mushy and the surround mix is non existent."
2,Disappointing,"Obviously, this is a remix of old analog music. Whereas the engineers managed to pull this off successfully with LA Woman and Brain Salad Surgery, something is lacking here, at least in the DVD Audio format. Perhaps the Dolby Digital 5.1 is better. Be advised that the new mix is way over the top and very gimicky."
2,I wouldn't recomment purchasing this DVD,We were never able to view the interview or other things that this DVD was suppose to have on it. The music was very good.
3,It's still the real band BUT....,"This is top 40 AC Band and they do a fine job of it especially when compared to their mainstream peers of the era. Critics and fans alike love this album but I guess I'm not with the crowd on this one. It's great in its own right but if you're like me and like your Coop with more edge, forget this altogether. The songs are well written but everything is way too slick and to a point formulaic. Get Killer, Love it to Death, Easy Action or even the psychedelic masterpiece Pretties For You instead."
2,The End Of A Great Band,this was sadly the demise of a seminal rock band. the voice was clearly going and their sound was being produced to appeal to the masses for a marketing blitz that carries on to this day.the album killer is where we close the book on a groundbreaking act. R.I.P
3,Timely for the election and their political take on society,The band rolls out some hits and commentary on life in the 70's from elections to the growing media...you can tell Alice is setting the tone for the band's direction.
2,"""Fancy Collar"" Diamond Collar","Lovely, however, there is a sharp metal piece under the snap where one attaches the leash and I had to throw the product away lest it scratch my dog's neck."
4,Many Logical Theories,"Galbraith advocates more emphasis on public spending: schools, public health, etc., in order to stop poverty from perpetuating, and to distribute the wealth of a very unbalanced society more equally. Galbraith has contributed the term ""conventional wisdom"" to the world of economics."
2,Interesting,This was overall a very good book. Galbraith portrays a very interesting point of view in the story. In memory of those who made it possible so others ould reach for the star.
1,An outdated and wrong book,"The Affluent Society is no longer relevant to contemporary economics. It was written in 1958, when the world was mired in the Cold War. Not only is this book irrelevant, it is also elitist and arrogant. Galbraith says that people who belied Karl Marx were inherently more intelligent. I think it is about time to stop calling an irrelevant book a classic."
1,Cool,"This was the coolest, i repeat coolest book i ever read. It's is about a guy. Did I mention he is very cool. God speed to the crew of Sputnik 1"
4,Affluenza?,"Written long before modern realization of how our desire for affluence as part of our ""right by birth"" has largely caused such things as global warming and elimination of species, Galbraith gives a very indepth exposé of the origins and tendencies of the North American material ethos. I would have given this book 4.5 or 5 stars save for the fact that it takes a bit of work on the reader to bring it fully up to date with respect to some of the consequences we now see.That said, I would heartily recommend this work prior to reading his or other author's more recent works on the direction of modern western society."
5,Wonderful!,"A wonderful, faith-based discussion of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers. Dr. Stanley's writing is cogent and concise, and always rooted firmly in the Bible. Through this book, the Holy Spirit has definitely changed how I understand and interact with Him. Fantastic!"
4,"Finally, a book that is easy-to-understand and apply.","Dr. Stanley writes in the easy way that he teaches on this sensitive subject. He shares his own experience of coming to understand that the more surrendered he was to God in his life; the more he gave up his ""rights"" and his ""will,"" the more the Spirit could fill him and lead him. The resulting joy and peace will leave you anxious to apply this new understanding to your own life. This book is not a lecture to the ignorant, but a sharing between friends. Inspiring in it's warmth and clarity."
5,The Wonderful Spirit Filled Life,"This book has changed by life. I am a born again Christian. I believein the Trinity....but I never knew that I could have a relationship withthe Holy Spirit. Charles Stanley presents the Holy Spirit in such a waythat makes you want to know Him and have a personal relationship withHim. Jesus knew before he left to go to the Father that we would allneed the 'Helper' that He would send. We cannot live a fulfilled lifeand handle all the situations, trials, and persecutions that we face inthis life on our own.But, we can, if we let the Holy Spirit guide us. The Holy Spirit indwellsevery Christian. He is waiting for all of us to get to know Him and askfor His help.I know. I did. And, He is ever present now in my life."
5,Making a Person Whole,"It is discernible that Dr. Stanley was well studied, prayed-up and inspired - ""Spirit Filled"" as he penned this book."
5,Boricua Knowledge,"This film enlightens you on what being a boricua is all about. I encourage others to view this film if wanting to know and learn more on their heritage. Rosie discovers the heritage form Puerto Rico to New York, after viewing this film it made me want to learn more so I did more research and still research about our people. I recommend this film to everyone wanting to know who u really are as a boricua."
1,This is Puerto Rico from a Ghetto Rican point of view.,"This sorry excuse for documentary is no more than a personal home video than anything else. Is sad how a bunch of Puerto Rican descendants decide to try making a documentary a fail.This film should be called. ""Puerto Rico from the point of view of Newyoricans that know nothing about the real Puerto Rico""DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
3,Entertaining Documentary,An Entertaining Documentary about Puerto Rican culture and history.With a look at Nuyorican life in the Big Apple.....
4,not what you would think,"yeah, i would like to politely ask amazon to not ask me to review any thing un less they are willing to pay me. Thanks Rob"
3,A Good Start but...,I am a Puerto Rican born and raised in New York. During my summers I used to go to the island for vacations and got to learn a lot of history. I never got the impression that Albizu Campos was ever considered or respected in the way that Rosie Perez portrays him in the documentary. It looks like these are really Rosie's own political views and are not reflective of the community at large. I still recommend the video but would caution against accepting it all as fact.
3,A unique take on the problems of determinism,"Honderich does a nice job of arguing for an understanding of the determinism ""problem"" that accounts for its persistence and points a way ""out."" He argues that both compatibilists and incompatibilists made the mistake of arguing that everyone really, deep down inside, if they were just to think about it long enough, shares a common view about origination, about whether or not we are uncaused causes. Each concludes that the other side has made a blunder by failing to see that commonality. Honderich argues that we, however, really partake in both attitudes. The attitude that involves origination involves beliefs and grounds that conflict with the truth of a determinism so Honderich then explores what we lose, what we can and cannot persist in, once we recognize these conflicts. A very subtle treatment, to which I cannot do justice in this space. Worth a look from anyone interested in determinism and free will."
5,good,this is a good move to see it so kool you ill like this i like it very good bye it you will k it
2,Typical Steven Seagal,Typical Steven Seagal movie. Steve breaks em down and busts em up as usual. Lots of action though...Maybe time to hang up dem spurs Steve
1,the belly of seagal,"mr. seagal really needs to rethink his movie making,as this film shows. no longer the sleak hard nosed tough guy he was,now he looks overweight,tired,and VERY,VERY SLOW!!!!!! this movie is a sad reminder of what mr. seagal was once capable of doing! really a sad movie!!!!!! skip it!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,For love of a child,"This is the best film Steven Seagal has made in a while. Seagal plays a retired CIA operative that use to work in Thailand. Ten years later he finds out his daughter was kidnapped while she was on vacation in Thailand. And as usual, his character does not play by the rules and will do what ever it takes to get his daughter back. Don't analyze the movie just sit back and enjoy the action. I also think you should pay attention to his sidekick who becomes a Buddhist monk. His character is very interesting, that is for what little we see of it. This is a good `B' action movie."
4,about the movie belly of the beast.......,This story is basically about how a terrorist group is being crushed. It contains a good number of action or fighting in this movie/film. A good recommendation to those whom are interested in this genre of movie/film. Enjoy....
4,Bashful's DVD Summary #006,"Best:1) Steven Seagal gets back to his eastern martial arts roots.2) The shoot-'em-up scenes were sweeping and included lots of people.3) The girls held hostage weren't just whimpering kittens waiting to be rescued.4) The acting, dialogue and editing was smoothly done.Worst:1) The hero characters seem to have supernatural abilities when it's cool to watch, then lose it whenever the filmmakers choose.2) Seagal relied heavily on a stunt double for many of the fight scenes.3) There are no special features on the disk.Recommendation:If you're a big action and/or martial arts fan, you'll definitely want to see this one at least once. If you often rewatch movies like this, you'll want to buy it. The lack of any special features, however, is a big factor in deciding that the going price may be too high for some people."
3,Best Seagal flick since Exit Wounds,"First of all, let me explain my 3-star rating. For Seagal flicks, I rate this one 3.5/5. For over-all action movies in this genre, I rate it about 2.75-3/5. As well all know the last half dozen or so Seagal flicks have lacked the penache his original outings did, but this one as is, is not bad. If this one would have been made earlier in Seagal's career, it may have been one of the top ones next to greats like Out for Justice, Marked for Death, or even one or both of the Under Siege movies.This movie has it all for a Seagal flick. Gun play, martial arts, and wire-fu with slo-mo effects. Well, I normally write longer, more in-depth reviews, but I'm leaving this one short and sweet. But if you're debating on whether or not to pull the trigger on this Seagal flick, don't hesitate. It's a fairly good one for a change."
5,allot of action,this movie is a fun rush of adrenaline. it's like riding a roller coaster. your kind of nervous at first but once it starts you aren't nervous anymore amd your having a great time. strongly reccomended.
3,STEVEN IS BACK FOR FIGHTING,THIS IS NOT THE BEST STEVEN SEAGAL BUT FILMED IN THAILAND I LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND A LOT OF GUNFIGHTS AND OUF !!! NOW STEVEN IS FIGHTING AGAIN BUT SOMETIME I WONDER IF IT IS HIM WHO FIGHT OR IS IT A STUNT WHO MADE THE FOOT FIGHTING BUT OK THIS MOVIE IS OK BUT I WILL NEVER FORGET MARKED FOR DEATH OR OUT FOR JUSTICEWELCOME BACK
3,He keeps churning them out,"Seagal really does put together a good guns&fights action flick. In fact, he keeps doing it, year after year, giving us a subscription to watchable movies, Seagal-style.That style seems to have solidified, if not congealed. There are only about three changes from one movie to the next. They are A) the good cause that needs saving from B) the bad guys, with a side order of C) pop spiritualism. In this case, A = his daughter, B = some Thai gunrunners and kidnappers, and C = Buddhism for the good guys and Kali-worship/voodoo for the bad guys. The Buddhoo angle makes for an interesting power-pray during the culminating fight scene, but otherwise seems improbable - like so many other things in the movie.It's just an action movie. Among action movies, it's just a Seagal movie. If that suits your taste, then improbability won't get in your way."
2,Steven Seagal washed up.,I'm a big fan of Steven Seagal but this latest movie was a mistake.He looks like the Pillsbury dough boy and his acting has gone down hill.This movie was made in China because no Amercian director wants a over weight martial arts actor.It's a real shame he fell apart and I say skip this movie.
2,Time to call it a day Steven?,"Oh dear, oh dear. Yet another ""straight to video"" release from Steven Seagal who this times plays a former government agent on the edge of retirement (yes I know you're shocked). He just happens to be in Thailand visiting his niece or granddaughter or whatever when she is kidnapped by some local ruffians. The CIA are on the case but this is simply ""not good enough"" for Mr. Seagal, who after all trained all of their fathers anyway, and he sets off on a one man mission of justice to sort everyone out, and of course save the girl. The usual mindless and implausible ""action"" ensues, interspersed with plenty of opportunity for Seagal to change into black clothing and perfect his ""hard stare"", which is now his preferred weapon, (when not crunching bones that is). As enjoyable as missing the last train home, I ask Mr. Seagal again - ""when are you going to retire?"""
2,not the seagal I knew before,"I haven't much of recent seagal films, but the reason I pick up a Seagal film isn't here, where are those nasty wrist locks and irimi nage moves? When did he turn into a guy that does spinning back kicks and jumping hook kicks. (I know its a stunt double doing those caz there's no shot of Seagal's face)This movie was entertaining, but its not what Seagal is all about. I know he's older, but hey remember Sean Conery in the move ""the Rock"", well that was more believable, why don't they make Seagal into some ex or retired bad ass special forces dude that they need back, at least that might work for him."
4,A great book about an important field,Web applications are getting more and more sophisticated--and important and Bob's book is a great start toward understanding how to build Web apps well. Pay special attention to his process as this will work long after the technology itself evolves past it's current state.
5,Best Chris Bennett C.D. Yet!,"Chris Bennett has always been a great jazz and pop singer, but on this C.D. she proves she is also a Latin Big Band Singer. What a hot album! I love her version of ""Use Me"" by Bill Withers ""Someone To Light Up My Life"" by Jobim is simply the most romantic cut I've heard in years. This is my favorite album - check it out!"
5,Mack Daddy used cd,This cd speaks for it's self LUVVV this cd I would highly recommend this cd to every body including friends and family lot of his old songs which r good!! KC
3,2 good songs..... great to dance to!!!,"Mack Daddy and Baby got Back are definutly the best songs on this CD. When these songs are played, it's impossible not to move. Baby Got Back is a song about a guy (Sir Mix A-Lot) liking big butts.... guys love this song!"
5,One Of The Better Rap CDs,"Most people think ""Baby Got Back"" is the best song on this album, but i'm under the inpression it's one of the worst. Most the other songs have great flow, potent lyrics that are either wise or hilarious, and aren't halfway as annoying. I honestly bought this album for the song ""Lcokjaw"", which is probably my favorite song on the album. But all in all, a great alubm. I beleive it was money well spent."
3,not my favorite,"I am a big fan of Harold and The Purple Crayon books. They really spark my 4 year old's imagination. But if your child tends to be easily frightened this will not be your favorite. Harold runs into a large lion with very big teeth, and falls thinking he will be caught by the elephant but gets caught by the lion instead."
4,Harold's Circus is for All Ages,Harold's Circus is a great book for everyone. The story is very imaginative. The story flows just like Harold's drawings. This book has lots of great yet simple pictures. The vocabulary can be a bit more complicated than the simple layout and drawings might suggest.
3,Easy Reading,"This is a love story, plain and simple and at times, a little too slow-moving and predictable for this reader. However, that said, ""True Believer"" can be an entertaining story for someone who just wants to relax and read and not be stressed by too much action, adventure or mystery. The story itself centers on small town life and legends and the people that make them. After reading ""The Guardian,"" I was somewhat disappointed by this Nicholas Sparks' work. I won't give up on him, however, because I know the talent behind the pen!"
1,Worst Sparks By Far,"After reading a number of his books, I know what I will get from a Sparks book. I know he will disparage anybody living near a town of more than 100,000 people, big-city people are shallow and self-absorbed in his world. Sparks' world is North Carolina and everyplace else beyond that is filler.You accept that, otherwise you don't have to read his books. And usually Sparks will temper the sappiness via something in the plot. You are not looking for real sanity or plausibility in a Sparks book, jsu some touches of credibility.But not in this book. Besides it being more sappy than any other book of his (why Jeremy loses his first wife), it seems Sparks does not like any of his characters. Plus the whole main story (what causes the lights) is given a half-baked treatment.By the end of the book I was hoping Rodney (the dim-witted police officer) takes his shotgun and shoots up the town."
2,Two StarZzzzzzzz,"As a Nicholas Sparks fan, I expected this book to be a page-turner similar to The Notebook. But I found it to be a great cure for my insomnia as often I'd read through two paragraphs and be soundly asleep! The character development is poor, at best. You barely grasp the personality of the main character until the very end of the book. Much time is spent describing the inner 'thoughts' of the characters, but very little time is spent on what they're actually doing. Hence, the plot moves slowly. The storyline has good bones, however. If you must read it, skim the first couple chapters and then skip to the last third of the book. You truly won't miss anything."
1,where's the spark?,"I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless. I give it a minus 10"
1,Very Boring,I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books. This was the most boring. I think he has run out of inspiration.
1,Nicholas Sparks but not quite up to par with his other books,"Journalist Jeremy Marsh, from New York City, meets librarian Lexie Darnell from Boone Creek, NC. He's in town looking into a local myth regarding ghostly lights in a cemetery. He needs the help of the librarian to conduct his research.Jeremy realizes he's fallen in love with Lexie. Lexie's been hurt before by men from the ""big city"". Lexie, despite her best intentions, succumbs to the obvious attraction, then regrets allowing herself to be vulnerable. She distances herself from Jeremy.Blah, blah ,blah.............Normally I'm a big fan of books by this author; just not this time."
3,Disappointing....,"Like most of the people who have left reviews, I have read every book that Nicholas Sparks has written. I anxiously await spring every year because I know a new one will be released. The book was ok, but just didn't meet my expectations of what a Nicholas Sparks novel should be. Maybe I set my expectations too high, but this book was too predictable and I felt cheated at the end.I'll buy anything that he writes, but this one will go on the shelf to collect dust."
1,Nothing at all,"Seriously, there was nothing at all, in my opinion, interesting about this blah book.Hard to believe that an author who can write stories like ""The Notebook"" can write a story as boring as this was."
1,Having a hard time reading it,"I am currently reading this book and am very disappointed in the storyline. Usually I am hooked on Nicholas Spark's books and can't put them down, but this one is an exception. It's taking me forever to get through this one because I only read one chapter at a time. To read any more than a chapter at a time is painful!! I'm not looking forward to reading the sequel!"
3,A great author disappoints his readers,"Jeremy Marsh is a science journalist from New York, who believes there is an explanation for everything. When he goes to Boone Creek NC, to debunk alleged ghost sightings, the last thing he expects to find is true love. Lexie Darnell is an intelligent, sophisticated, self-made librarian, and seems out of place in the nowhere town of Boone Creek. But as far as she is concerned, there is no place she'd rather be. Although lonely at times, she is content with her quiet life... that is, until Mr. Marsh arrives. Are there ghosts in Boone Creek? Is Lexie's Grandmother psychic? Can YOU take a leap of faith, and believe?If I had two words to describe this book they would be ""ho"" and ""hum"". I really like Nicholas Sparks, and in True Believer I was quite disappaointed. I may have enjoyed this book more, if I didn't have higher expectations from the author of The Notebook, and Message in a Bottle."
1,Still looking for improvement,"Forced upon the world by Warner Pub. years ago, we're still subjected to less than mediocre writing accomplishment in these books. This one takes bland writing to a new low. I would characterize this one as rambling and plotless sprinkled with excruciatingly dull and insignificant dialogue and all the insight into complex human emotions of love as a grade school student.So many unknown writers with fine works out there that are surpassed by these publisher marketing-backed works of unemotional dribble. ---Such a world."
2,"No ""sparkle"".......yet, anyway","I'm only on Chapter 5, but I'm having a hard time getting into the storyline. I realize this is a ""prerequiste"" to First Sight, so, hopefully I can trudge through it. I've read 5 or 6 of his books and throughly enjoyed all of them, but so far, this one's not cutting it."
2,A little too cheesy,"This book was just okay. It is my second Nicholas Sparks book, and I am trying to figure out why he is so loved. Both the books I have read, ""A Bend in the Road"" and now ""True Believer"" were just okay. Both of these books seemed to follow the formula of boy and girl meet, boy and girl fall in love after some apprehension by one of them, boy and girl encounter snag in relationship, boy and girl work everything out in the end. Also, am I the only one that feels these are so unbelievably cheesy that they just want to gag?? The last line of ""True Believer"" almost had me lose my dinner it was so disgustingly cheese-ball."
1,Item Arrived Worn and Dirty,"I received this book in the mail. It was supposed to be ""new"". It seemed to have water damage and food stuck on it. It is gross and I am returning it."
3,It's ok,"I have loved every single book Nicholas Sparks has written except for Message in a Bottle and now True Believer. The characters were 2 dimensional and no connection. It wasn't a story that reached out and grabbed me. Now I am not sure if I want to read the sequal At First Sight. If I do, I will look for a used copy."
3,"wasn't very interesting. i felt like it dragged on too long. the ending was okay, but not great.","It was an okay book. It spanned a short time period. It wasn't very interesting and the romance wasn't nearly as intense as it was in ""the notebook"", ""the wedding"", and ""message in a bottle."" That's what I love about Sparks though. I love to feel the passion and the intense romance in his writing. I didn't feel that here. I felt it dragged a little. I wish the lights had involved the lighthouse and not what the true answer was. I didn't like the ending too much. It was okay, but too cliche. I could have done without what Lexie said in the end. I felt like it wasn't necessary.thank you for your timeand feel free to comment my review,Loran"
4,Rivetting!!,"This was a very rivetting book, with a great unexpected twist at the end. Very enjoyable reading"
4,Good read,"Enjoyed this book, there were a few slow parts, but were made up for in later chapters. I spent summers on the Outer Banks as a kid and his descriptions of that area bring back many memories for me. I can almost smell the salt air!"
3,True Believer,"True Believer is yet another wonderful book written by Nicholas Sparks. In the novel, the relationship between Lexie and Jeremy grows and develops into something beautiful. The plot becomes more interesting and Nicholas Sparks creates situations that are unexpected. This books keeps you guessing until the very end.I truly enjoyed this novel. I have read all of the books by Nicholas Sparks and this one is in my top half. I loved to see the relationship between Lexie and Jeremy grow, and to see how they deal with real life situations that occur to many couples. Once again, the emotions that I felt were overwhelming and wonderful: from happiness to sadness Nicholas Sparks had it all. I truly recommend this book to anyone in need of a wonderful story between a man and a woman."
4,I'm anxious for the sequel to come out!,"I enjoyed this book!Having said that - I must confess that it didn't have the kind of romantic and deep abiding love story that I've come to expect from his other books. Generally, I can expect a good, heathy cry at least a couple of times during the read. I didn't get that this time.The book is about a writer who is famous for dis-proving the reality of ghosts and mindreaders and such - and reports his findings on television...etc. He goes to a small North Carolina (what else) town to prove that their ""cemetary ghosts"" aren't real and falls in love with the beautiful local librarian. I guess part of the dis-connect is the somewhat lack of chemistry I feel between the two lead characters. I actually felt more chemistry between him (Jeremy) and her grandmother! I'm hoping this changes in the sequel. I'm such a big Sparks fan (having read every single book he's written) that I want to love all of his works."
5,"I loved this book but isnt this the same as ""at first sight""??","I read at first sight and it has the same names and everything. its a good thing i read about it before i bought it.. but i loved this book, it was the first one i read and they got me hooked. I have now read ""bend in the road"" ""the choice"" and its still my favorite.."
4,is seeing really believing or believing is seeing,If a person has to see to know for sure something is true or can they believe just by the word of mouth from others? I would say this can go back and forth and this book is a great example of how seeing is not always believing. There are always science to define how something happens but that does not mean something can mean something special for the person viewing the event. A journalist has to investiage some lights that have been reported to be spirits of the one thing or another and while he is there he falls in love with one of the residents and the rest of the story is history to say. Anyone who likes this book needs to read At First Sight right after.
2,Dumb,"Normally, I love Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one is not great. It is incredibly slow, and the whole book could be written in about 30 pages."
2,Nicholas Sparks; Not Up to Par,"I've read all of the other Nicholas Sparks books and loved each and every one. But reading his new one, i was thoroughly dissapointed. I got halfway through the book and nothing was really going on. The characters disappointed me and alot of the thoughts and dialogues seemed highly repetative. The ending was absolutely predictable and during the entire book I caught myself cringing with the bad writing. I was hugely dissapointed because this was not what i would expect from Nicholas Sparks. If you are a Nicholas Sparks fan and love all of this books, go ahead and read it but don't expect the be thrilled, expect to be disappointed."
4,True Believer,"I can see why people love to read these books. Why they watch the movies based on his books. A Walk To Remember his my favorite but that's because Shane West was in it. At first the first chapter took me forever to read. I just wasn't into it but afterward I got passed it, I couldn't put this down. I've been sucked in. Now I want to read more."
4,Sparks does it again.,"Even though the Notebook and The Wedding may have been a little better, this book has all the charm and emotion one would expect from Sparks. This book is a must read for all Sparks fans."
4,Looking forward to reading the sequel,"I first read the Notebook and granted this story is no where near as wonderful as the Notebook, I still loved it. I don't usually read romance novels but I have started reading Sparks'. He hasn't let me down yet! However, the romance is a little too predictable but his way of writing makes the book interesting. I look forward to reading At First Sight!"
4,The truth sets us free,"""True Believer"" by Nicholas Sparks may take place in Boone Creek, NC but such stories take place in many such communities everywhere. Some of us barricade ourselves in endless activity; some of us do it with continual good work for others. Some may do it with scholarly work or 'business'. And there is always someone trying to 'debunk' strongly held beliefs. Getting folks to be up front with deep feelings is not so easy -- so a 'fairy grandmother' or aunt steps in and makes it easier. So many times the choices we make in our lives have 'forever' consequences; and to be led to make the best choice available requires a helping hand. And this book has it all. I really enjoyed it."
2,Sparks' Worst,"I am normally a huge Sparks fan. However, this book...well, I was disappointed. I didn't buy the love story at all. Nothing made me feel like these two people ever fell in love. It could have been a very touching story and instead it feels very forced."
4,Great summer read!,"Although this is not comparable to Nicholas Spark's most memorable works...my favorites ""The Notebook"" and ""The Guardian,"" it was still a great book and well worth reading. I loved the story that he put together; it was very creative and the characters were believable and memorable!Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author, I only wish he wrote his books faster!"
4,A great summer read,Take this to the beach or your favorite vacation spot (even out to the yard in the hammock). A very sweet book.
3,Sparks fly,"My first novel by Nicholas Sparks was an enjoyable audiobook experience. There were no stellar plot twists or complex characters to rave about, just good story flow and believable dialogue that had a good measure of wit and spontaneity."
2,Left me wanting,"I just finished True Believer and I am so glad that I got this from the library, rather than purchasing it.It makes for an enjoyable read, but it seemed rather shallow & superficial. I must admit, I have never read any of Sparks novels before, but I have seen the movies Message in a Bottle and The Notebook. Both were excellent, so I had high hopes for this book.It wasn't that the book was bad, it was just I almost felt cheated regarding the main story of the book (mysterious lights in a cemetery).All in all it flows very well, but the writing style seems more in the order of a made for TV movie than a serious work of fiction.Of course, that's just my opinion--then again, I could be wrong."
2,N. Sparks latest,"This book starts out with a new twist to a ghost-hunt. But the romance that builds overshadows what could remain an intriguing story. He also attempts to describe life in a small but dying southern town but his description is not especially flattering to what southern life is really like. The ending is predictable and leaves you nowhere. This does not compare to some of his earlier work, especially ""Message in a Bottle"" (a book I have read and re-read...) I wish I'd waited for paperback and not spent the hardback money."
4,enjoyable summer read,"I have always been a big fan of Nicholas Sparks. However, I haven't enjoyed his last few books as some of his older novels. I bought this book several months ago just because I always buy his books. It sat on the shelf as I read other books first. Due to some bad reviews I was hesitant to read it. I finally decided last week that I was just going to read it and get it over with. Well, I was pleasantly surprised! I finished it in 4 days, I thought it was very well written and the story was very sweet. It was a perfect summer read and fans of Nicholas Sparks will not be disappointed."
2,not for me,"If you are a Sparks fan, you were probably prepared for this. I was not. The PW description seduced me into thinking it was a story about journalist investigating mysterious lights. It isn't. The lights serve only to get Our Hero to the place where he meets cliched smart beautiful librarian, so that he can ultimately embrace the charms of rural life.Now, just about every romance formula is done over and over, and if it is done well, I enjoy it over and over. I did not think this was done well. The characters were all surface; there was no apparent reason for Hero to fall for this particular woman or she for him (except that pickings are slim in a very small town). And it struck me as being purely anti-moderniist/technological -- a tiny backwater town equated with all that is good. (the concomitant bad thinks about the small town did not figure in). On the whole, I would rate this similarly to a Danielle Steele, which is negative to me but of course, in the eyes of many, a high compliment."
1,Dissapointing.,"I see that this book is number 2 on the bestseller list and it makes me wonder if I should ever let the ""list"" play a role in what I choose to read. There is absolutely no depth to any of the characters or the plot, which is very predictable and boring. The author tried to create a mystery which didnt pan out. In short a cheap paperback romance bought at a drugstore is probably more entertaining."
2,Slow but characters had great potential,This was my first Sparks book and I was disappointed. The description led me to believe that the story would be about the investigation of the lights with a little romance thrown in. Instead the lights seem to have been a background story to the developing relationship of the two main characters. Although easy to read it didn't keep my interest. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen but almost felt as if I was reading the condensed version of the book and in depth details had been left out.The story line had a lot of promise but didn't seem to be developed to its full potential.
3,So So!,I bought this as a audiobook I have read all of his previous books and they were all great. This one I started listening to about 5 different times and just couldn't really get into it. Finally I made myself listen to it because I paid good money for it and I wasn't going to waste the money. It was by far not his best. But it was okay. If you love Nicholas Sparks I would give it a try so you don't miss out on any of his stories.
3,"Very pleasant audio, mediocre story","This seemed the perfect book to listen to while working at my mindless job. Not too heavy on characters or depth of plot, True Believer is a terrific escape from books where you have to figure something out. This sweet romance, where I patiently waited for even the first kiss to happen, provided a delightful distraction from the-LOL-exciting world of data entry.I could have done without the ""mysterious lights"" storyline, and I wondered why the psychic concept of determining a baby's gender wasn't further explored instead. That would have thrust this book into the page-turner category.For a better concept of Sparks' tearjerking abilities, I'd advise trying The Notebook or The Rescue instead.The narrator was soothing without being sleepy...I got the feeling he'd actually bothered to read the book in advance. I'll look for this speaker again."
2,Not as good as the rest,"I tried, I REALLY tried to get into this novel. I sat down with a whole day to do nothing but read, and found myself having to force my way through this one! I have always loved Mr. Sparks' novels, but this one put me to sleep. Ok, the last chapter was pretty good, but I wouldn't try reading it again."
3,typical nicholas sparks,"If you have read any of his other works, this is along the same caliber although he has written better. From the first chapter, I found it very predictable. Good if you are looking for a quick read, I finished it in a day."
2,"So-so plot, cold main characters","SPOILER ALERT!The daughter and son-in-law of the local psychic dies in a car accident. How come the psychic didn't warn them? She's supposed to be 100% right.Also, Lexie, the librarian, doesn't give the ghostbuster character all the information he needs. When he finds out facts, he asks her why she didn't tell him, she always replies, ""You didn't ask!""Stupid. If he *knew* he wouldn't need to ask! A poor librarian, IMHO."
2,I was not thrilled...,"I am a big Nicholas Sparks fan...but this book was sooo hard to get into. I think at around pg 150 it finally caught my intrest. I almost didn't finish it, but I'm a little quirky and always finish a book no matter how bad it is. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the ending was great!"
2,Not a Believer,"There have been several Sparks books that I've enjoyed, despite the lack of character development and the often elementary grammar and storylines. I always held out hope that he would write something more `adult' with flowing sentences and a higher level of readability. Well, he certainly tried to do that with True Believer but, failed. I'm not a believer that this was a great story; the two characters are brought together haphazardly and without a foundation of friendship and respect. They spend a majority of their time tossing insults at one another and chasing `ghosts' that turn out to be absolutely nothing in the end. The premise is ridiculous, and I wouldn't recommend this book. Although it's far better than some of his previous books, in terms of writing ability, the storyline now suffers and the characters just don't inspire any warmth."
2,I have no idea what happened here - Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author,"But I could not even get half-way through this book. It is the only book of his I have not been able to finish. I just didn't connect with the characters or the subject matter.....As always, though, I will continue to read (and hopefully complete next time), everything he puts out. This book, and its sequel, are the only books of his I have never made it through."
5,Great book,This is book 2 of the Jeremy Marsh series. Loved it! A surprise twist to the book too! Wow! Recommend it to any Nicholas Sparks fan.
4,"good, not great.","i just have one thing to say.. where did my favorite author go ? i mean, Sparks is typically an excellent author. so what happened ? were my expectations too high or what ?"
2,Sloppy,"Very ""cranked out"" feel.The editors were very sloppy too...did no one even bother to fact check this book? The main character was raised by her grandmother, a woman in her 60's when the story takes place. The main character is in her 30's. Therefore, the grandmother had to have been in her 30's when her granddaughter was born.I kept waiting for this to be mentioned in the story, that the main character was born to a teen mother, or something. However, we find out later that the main character's mother grew up, became a libarian, married, and worked ""for years"" at the local libary before the main character was born. The grandmother's history is also mentioned...she grows up, marries, has the protagonist's mother. Neither of them was a teen mom.But if the grandmother is only in her 60's, and the main character in her 30's, this time line is technically impossible.Were both the editors and author asleep?Given the content of this book, I wouldn't doubt it."
1,Terrible...,"This book came to me by mistake, I did not order it, but have read two other Nicholas Sparks books, so I thought, why not? I wish I had sent it back. It's very predictable and could not keep my attention even on the beaches of Mexico. Do not waste your money or time on this book."
3,A let down,"I am a big fan of Nicholas Sparks and will read his new books without even knowing what they are about but was let down with his newest effort, True Believer.Jeremy is a resident of New York City and is a divorced freelance science writer. He is always looking for a new story to uncover the truth about the great mysteries of the world.Lexie is a lonely 31 year old woman who is living in a very small town in South Carolina. She has been burned one too many times by falling in love with the wrong man.Put those two characters together and a weak back drop story about mysterious lights in the Boone Creek cemetary that could be ghosts and you have True Believer. Nothing exciting, and nothing that makes you want to turn the pages except to reach the ending.I am willing to bet that if you are a Sparks fan, you wont mind reading the story but my best advice is to wait until it comes out in paperback. Its just not worth the HC price."
1,Nicholas Sparks at his worst!!!,"Nicholas Sparks' latest novel is a book that I am sure you will forget as soon as you finish it. Not that this is a bad thing in this case - given the undeveloped characters, the ""twists and turns"" that broadcast themselves from the first chapter, and the ridiculously sappy tacked-on ending.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time - read Gilead by Marilynne Robinson, or Baker Towers by Jennifer Haigh, instead."
1,Predictable drivel,"I chose this book from the public library because I plan on attending a luncheon later this year where Sparks will be the guest speaker, and I have never read any of his books. I was expecting something at least good, maybe great, but all I can say is, I am glad I didn't have to pay for this trite, predictable, sophomoric excuse for a novel. Dull doesn't begin to cover it. And I thought the Twilight books were bad. Any Amazon reviewer produces more interesting reading than this rubbish. I read the first few chapters, then skipped to the end. No improvement. I might still try The Notebook, but from the library because it's free."
1,I'm still waiting...,"for SOMETHING to happen in this book! One of the first rules of fiction writing is to start ""in medias res"" in the middle of things. I'm past the middle of this book and nothing has happened that makes me want to continue. Jeremy has seen the lights, but even THAT was boring. It would be more interesting if we were in on Jeremy's research, rather than just ""didn't find anything interesting. I want to see Lexie"". He's reading diaries, newspaper accounts, all of which would prove interesting to his ultimage findings, but we're treated to internal agonizing about what Lexie might be thinking. Or doing, or saying, or not saying. And with Lexie, what Jeremy is thinking, doing, saying or not saying. If something doesn't happen soon, I am going to quit and put it in my donate pile. I may revise my review, but I paid for the darn book and I'm going to try to stick it out. The only thing I have to add is that Lexie is rude and unlikeable in the extreme."
1,Don't waste your time,"The characters are not only flat, but the little development there was made me dislike them. I just cannot understand what Jeremy sees in Lexie. To me she comes off as boring, sarcastic, aloof, fickle, and arrogant. Jeremy is insipid, avoiding and cowering from the deputy marshall and taking all of Lexie's flack. Maybe that's why he was attracted to her, but c'mon, who wants to read a book about a mealy-mouthed man falling in love with a harpy?And if the focus was supposed to be plot, I'm very sorry to hear that. Because the plot was nothing to write home about either. The conflicts were mediocre at best. Sparks had a lot of opportunities with his subject matter - he could have made it much more suspenseful and spooky, he could have played up the benefits of small-town life, he could have made his characters flawed but likeable. He totally missed."
1,Tedious Read,"This book seemed to just drag on and on and the two main characters just never jelled in my opinion. How does one fall in love in one week? Two such different people? Not very realistic and the interaction between them always seemed more strained then loving. In the sequel, At First Sight, this smaller book was the true ending to True Believer. The sequel should never been a book alone but the way True Believer should have ended in the first place. The abrupt ending had me saying ""huh?""in the first book and the second book was more of the same for me with these two characters and I won't ruin it for those who haven't read At First Sight yet by telling the ending but the ending for me just didn't sit well. It just made the both books seem pointless."
1,Sparks Fizzles,"I thought I would never ""diss"" a Sparks novel, but I am. This was a disaster. It almost seemed that Sparks just cranked out something for the sake of cranking. Totally boring, predictable and yucky! If I say anymore, I'll just annoy myself further. Please don't waste your time unless you want something to bellyache with to the neighbors over the fence."
1,stinker,"Ok, I'll admit, I read Nicholas Sparks' books when I can't find anything else, and I don't expect a lot from him, but this book is ridiculous. Nothing more than a poorly written romance novel."
2,Too Predictable,Not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected. I didn't really connect with the main characters. I was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects (the lights) it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story.
2,Not much going on in this book,"I have to start by saying this is the first Nicholas Sparks book I've read. I have watched Message in a Bottle and The Notebook movies, and really liked both. I thought I would give one of his books a try. I apparently picked the wrong one. This book is slow, repetitive, and there is not much going on. The ""ghost story"" part of the story is lame. The ""romance"" between Jeremy and Lexie reads like a high school romance."
4,Good summer read,This was a good easy reading summer book. Nothing spectacular but a good book. I have read others by this author which were better. Not his best book but still OK.
2,Not as good as Sparks' others,"The characters are great - as are most of Sparks' characters. However, it moved kind of slow, but a nice, clean love story."
3,I am a true believer,"I have read about 6 other Nicholas Sparks books. I liked this book and sort of did not like this book. I thought that the characters took awhile to get together. I wish that they had a better way of meeting each other. I did not like the female character in this book. She drove me crazy! She liked him, then did not like him. I should should tell you about the book. Jeremy is a journalist for the magazine Scientiic advocate. He has an assignment to do a story of a haunted cememtery. When he gets to this city, he falls in love with the librian Lexie.Funny thing about this the author's book, even though, you might not crazt about the story, you still can not put this book down and that is what happened to me."
2,Sparks is getting boring,"I have read all of Nicholas Sparks and he's getting rather boring. Generally I can handle the same story told over and over again as with all Sparks' books. Small town in NC, someone is getting over another someone, stranger comes to town and falls in love with someone from NC. Said someone doesn't want to get hurt, so there is a back and forth struggle until the end when everything is peachy again.True Believer is even WORSE! There just wasn't much of a story at all. Albeit it is the same story again, but at least with most of his other books there is another back story. This one was very weak and not very interesing. Save the time and pick up something else"
1,The Doctor's Review,"I'm glad it was short! Sooooooo predictable and typical of Sparks. There are so many really good things out there, don't waste your time. UGH!"
3,Not what you would expect from this writer!!,"After reading his other books this was very slow reading, not up to par. I kept hoping it got better, I was dissapointed by the buildup of the ""lights"" and the explanation ended up being very boring. A better ending for the TRUE BELIEVER would have been if those lights would have ended up being Lexie's parents watching out for her and the town."
1,Poor Review,The book was rated in new condition and it arrived with no dust cover plus the seller had applied a sticker to the black binding which was coming off and taking the paper with it.I will not be using this seller again.
1,This is a Romance novel,"This is a romance novel hiding out under the guise of good fiction. Trite & contrived, incredibly predictable and unbelievable....it left me shaking my head over the money I wasted on it."
3,Nick what happened?,"I have read every Nicholas Sparks book and have enjoyed every single one up this point. Any time he comes out with a new book I automatically get it knowing it will be great without even reading anything about it. Not so with True Believer. I had the hardest time reading this book and turning the pages. It was slow and boring. Im my opinion, Sparks worst book by far. If you read it don't expect much or a classic. I even thought about not finishing this book. But painfully made my way through it. What a disappointment."
2,Add my name to the list,"The book was a snooooooooze..... It took everything in me not to fall asleep. This is not a book that I could tell you in good conciousness to buy because I would be a liar. If you want a romance that will keep you turning the pages until you finish the book then you MUST..buy Whispers of the wicked saints. Don't be fooled there is a typo on the cover, but don't let that stop you from an awesome romance.. You won't believe the twist and turns. As for Sparks?? I just don't know what to say. I hope this is not the end for him, because I have enjoyed his work, but I have to admit I am a little worried."
1,very disappointing,"Nicholas Spark's, you have let me down. TRUE BELIEVER reads as if it was written by a teenager who has had little experience when it comes to love. The story is totally unrealistic and unmoving. Readers, don't waste your time with this one. Instead, read MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE or THE NOTEBOOK. Those two are worthy!!"
1,What is this???,Please don't tell me that this is the new Nicholas Sparks. This new book is totally BORING. They don't even fall in love til like 9 or 10 chapters into the book!!!! The first 2/3 of the book are wasted. Goodness....I really hope Nicholas goes back to writing well-respected love stories like The Notebook
1,What A Joke!,This was the biggest waste of time I've experienced in a long while. The romance was so far-fetched and unrealistic it was laughable...like he would really be so gung ho about a girl who wouldn't give him the time of day after just meeting her. And the whole mysterious lights thing was a MAJOR letdown. I teach special education and I'm positive most of my students would be able to come up with a more creative and interesting explanation that Sparks did. Nicholas Sparks has always been one of my favorite authors but this book was just ridiculous. He better step it up for the next book or I won't be spending my cash on any more.
3,Predictable romance,"Jeremy Marsh is a handsome young journalist who is assigned to cover a story about mysterious lights which appear in the small town of Boone Creek, North Carolina. When he arrives, he meets the town librarian, Lexie Darnell, who soon lets him know that she has been hurt by romances in the past and she refuses to get involved with a big-city man such as himself. They spend the rest of the book falling in love and trying to resist each other because they are so different and they lead very different lives. Usually the best part of Nicholas Sparks novels is the depth of his characters, but somehow Jeremy and Lexie don't become as well-developed or as loveable as many characters in Sparks' other books. He has written some memorable books with somewhat tragic endings, but this book is all fluff and not much substance. Hopefully Sparks will return to what he does best in the future."
2,...hello...Nicholas where are you?,"What happened? Where did my amazing author go? This was a disappointment for me. In every Sparks book I am SO glued to it I can't put it down. This one I bought the day it came out and FINALLY finished it a week and a half later. I couldn't absorb this story. I could read the ending right after meeting Doris and knowing about her 'power'. I NEVER guess Sparks endings. I am usually the one crying my eyes out, smiling that he blindsided me with something I did NOT expect! This was like every other romance novel. Nothing spectacular. I didn't like Jeremy. He seemed to perfect in that 'stud' way, I couldn't tell how genuine he was. Lexie just struck me as being the 'let's feel sorry for me' type. Too sappy and I just didn't get into it. I want to at least give this a three star 'OK' rating but can't because I was disappointed in this."
2,Disappointed Sparks fan :(,"I was so excited about Sparks having a new book coming out. I preordered the book and started reading as soon as it was delivered. I have to say, I was bored. I kept reading hoping that it would get better but there was just no ""spark"" to the plot."
1,Lack of Sparks,This book was by far one of Nicholas Sparks worst ever.....he is a one hit wonder....The Notebook was his only decent one.
2,Wait for the Movie!,"Not all that good. I was waiting for a revelation, which never came. The explanation he wound up with was less than dramatic, and the promise of the start of the book didn't come through. A disappointment, but perhaps a movie will come out of this . . and that would probably be worthwhile, if done right."
2,true believer,"I was tottaly disapointed in this book. All other nicholas sparks books pull you in and you can't put them down. It took my two weeks to read the whole book, all other books I read in two days. My thought is to skip this one."
2,Too boring to finish,I have read all Nicholas Sparks books and usually find them enjoyable and an easy read - but this is sooo slow! I have tried to finish reading it but cannot.....
3,True Believer,"Jeremy Marsh is a good looking and sophisticated New Yorker who came down to North Carolina to write a feature story on the ghostly lights that appear over Boone Creek's graveyard. Upon his arrival, he meets beautiful Lexie Darnell, the town's well educated librarian who provides him with background information on the supernatural. During their interactions, they realize that they are naturally attracted to each other and a romance begins. Jeremy soon discovers the secrets behind the apparitions of Boone Creek... This unfortunately is a slow and boring story that is very predictable! But it had great potential."
5,True Believer Review,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I feel that all of Nicholas Spark's books are amazing, and I have read them all. This one had a happy ending, which was really nice. I enjoyed the characters, they seemed very real."
4,Sparks does it again,"As a fan of Nicholas Sparks, I've come to appreciate the predictability his stories provide. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a light-hearted, quick read. If you're looking for intense characters and plot lines, this is not the book for you... but if you're just looking to unwind, you will enjoy it!"
3,So-so from start to finish,"True Believer is the fourth N.S. book I've read. While it is a good book there are parts in the book that are just not enjoyable. You have to force yourself to get past those parts to move on to more exciting parts. The overall story is cute and I really liked the ending but, it is not my favorite N.S. book."
3,True Believer by Nicholas Sparks book review,"This was the first book by Nicholas Sparks I have ever read so I could not compare it to his others. I, however, did enjoy this book. I wasn't as interested in the love aspect of the book, as I was in what he did for a living. Trying to figure out what the lights in the cemetery are intrigued me, and I think that is why I liked the book as much as I did. If it was just a love story, I wouldn't have enjoyed it so much."
2,"Book Reads Just like the Movie - ""Doc Hollywood""","Don't get me wrong, I loved ""Doc Hollywood"", but because I knew it so well, it made this book seem very predictable. Guy from a big city comes to a small town in the South. Finds the people who live there to be very quirky. Sees a woman and is attracted immediately.Yes, there is a side story about ghosts in the cemetery, which starts off really interesting. However, by the end of the book it loses its punch.Overall, the book was okay. But I felt like the whole time I was reading it that I had already heard this story before in ""Doc Hollywood."""
1,Borrrrrrrrrring,"When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters. Neither panned out. This book is boring. The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery. Too much detail and not enough substance. Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it."
1,Ouch! Worse than Most Paperback Romances,"This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market. ""True Believer"" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches. There is no plot. No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash. The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, ""thinking"" to themselves. Wow, is this bad. ""Message in a Bottle"" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then. You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed."
1,BORING>>ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ............,"I have read all of Sparks books. Some are great, others are well, not.This book was a HUGE disappointment. The first 170 pages say nothing that the other 169 haven't already said. I couldn't figure out the point. He introduces characters we could care less about. His writing is dull. He doesn't say anything of interest, just rambles on.The story goes no where for the first 2/3 of the book. My high school daughter could've written a more interesting book.Save your money."
5,Great instructional video!,"This is a great reference DVD for both country western line dancing and any swing dance that uses jazz steps (which means all of them)! It teaches you 70 basic jazz steps - really clear and easy to follow instructions, as well as several fun and simple beginner line dances. This is a real gem, so don't pass it up just because it's a VHS tape!"
1,Where did it go?,"I just finished using this product and felt like I needed to warn people of the tiny amount provided in the box. I have used this in the past, but it was a couple of years ago. It was a wonderful product then, with enough color to take care of all the roots. When I opened the box (box same size as before), the mixing bowl, color and developer was 1/2 the amount it was back then. I do not recommend this product to anyone any more. I won't get clairol anymore either. Who knows what surprises are in the other boxes now."
3,Fair product,"This product is only for the roots not all over color, read the box. It does cover the roots very well and lasts just as long as a whole box color but...you will have problems using all over color afterwards. For some reason I had to color my hair twice within one week to get it to take. I will not use it again."
1,skimpy,"I have all over grey, which I color dark brown. This was a very small amount of color. It was hard to mix in the ""scoop"" provided. It did cover my roots, but only just. There is no conditioner included in this kit. I left it on 10 minutes and color is darker than indicated on the box. I will not buy it again."
1,orange! horrible,"Do not buy, turned my hair nasty orange! Save up enough to get your money to get your hair down in the salon."
2,Cookbook,"Good book if you have lots of space, a cooler, and can handle lots of weight. Not much for backpackers. The writers state that if you see birds or other animals eating something, it is safe. If you follow this recommendation, make a good will first. What is poisonous to one animal is safe for another. (Like dogs are poisoned by chocolate.) Know your plants! Also, I object when they recommend burying your used cans after burning them first. Bears can still smell the food after burning the cans and will dig them up. Also frost can heave them up, ruining it for the next camper. Rule is: Pack it in, pack it out. Please don't leave your garbage behind, including the cans!"
4,5 month old loves it !!!,"I bought this when my son was 5 months old.He loves the lights that flash back and forth as the music plays.And he can push the keys to start the songs.One month later and he's still using it :) it's been dropped stepped on and still keeps going..lol.The music is alittle loud,but makes up for the smiles."
3,BE CAREFUL,"Just a note of caution, our grandson 7 months loves this toy and it is a charmer; however he is able to get the wand completely in his mouth. Our concern now that he is trying to sit up is that he could topple over and shove it deeper into his mouth causing injury. We cut the wand off and will only give it to him when we are sitting with him and he is in his walker. This should be sold with a warning or be recalled to remove the wand."
4,mom aj says this is a great toy,"My baby loves this toy! She loves the lights and the music and the attached wand. She always reaches for this one when surrounded by her toys. I only wish it had an on/off switch (why don't all toys have one?) And one time when she spit up, some of the spit up got into the toy and it went bananas! Luckily Grandpa was able to take it apart and clean it out and now it works just fine again. But, this is a wonderful, entertaining toy for baby."
4,Fun for Infant and Toddler,I bought this for my 6 month old but found out that its just as much fun for my 3 year old. Both of them enjoy seeing the lights and dancing to the music. The one negative is that there isn't a on/off switch.
3,It broke within weeks,This was a fun little item until it broke within weeks of normal use. First it wouldn't turn off (we had to remove the batteries) and now only works sporadically. I expected more of FP.
3,wouldnt shut up,"this is a good toy, however, ours would not shut up after less than one month's use. we ended up removing the batteries, to get it to stop."
4,"Attractive, fun and LOUD...","Our daughter received this from her grandma at 4 months. She likes the music and lights and seems to be developing a sense of cause-and-effect, learning that she can turn it on herself. Since she's not sitting up just yet, I sit her and the xylophone in my lap and we play together. Overall, we're happy with it. I can see the cord is just long enough that it could be a problem when she's older and playing by herself. If that's the case I will cut it off. Also, I wish there were volume and power switches. It is easily set off and very loud on the instrument side, where the speaker is."
3,This is a very loud toy,"Our daughter started playing with this toy when she was about seven months old. She is now 12 months and still enjoys it. She especially likes the side that has drums and bells. That is when she finds it after we have hidden it! This toy is very loud. We were hoping that it would become quiteter when the batteries go down, but no such luck. If you can tolerate the decibles, good luck!"
2,disappointing,only the intrument side actually behaves as envisioned.the xylophone side is not a xylophone but a music box where a bar press plays the next few notes of a melody. Nor does it allow playalong
3,Not worh the 'new' price!,"This book is full of errors. That said, it does have a lot of information and I appreciate its narrow focus. Find a nice used copy for $5-$10 and you'll probably be satisfied -- pay $38 and you'll go ballistic!"
4,Made me realize I wasn't so weird.,"I got this book for myself after my father died. He had a long illness and I was one of his main caregivers. This book helped my realize that my lack of grief wasn't so weird as I had been led to believe. With everyone telling me of their sympathies and how ""it will get better"", I wasn't feeling much but a sense of relief. Both he and I had prepared and expected his death, it came as no surprise. I needed this book and plan on giving it to another friend who recently suffered a loss of a loved one. I found a great sense of help from its pages."
5,A true keeper--and for giving,"So much written about grief is well intended but trite, or else, in some way or other, an evasion of the horror that has happened. But in this book Ms. Rufus, a professional journalist and author skilled in the use of humor for serious purposes, has explored our reactions, both to loss and to dealing others' reactions to our loss, with exactly the seemingly mundane ironic tone that hits right on into our emotions. This one's a keeper--and also for giving to friends who have suffered loss."
3,interesting but,"Reading this book left me with a distinctly sour taste in my mouth. Almost every page offers some (real life) anecdote about a person who responded in a petty fashion to grief. There's a stoy about a girl who was mocked behind her back, and then after her death as well. There's a story about a woman who manipulated her mother's will to get the best possessions. And so it goes. Not very appetizing, however true to life such reactions may be.Do people really feel all these things when their loved one dies? Perhaps, but isn't it a sweeping assertion to say so? And will giving this book to someone who is grieving really make them feel any better? Somehow I doubt it."
3,Greatly Watered-down Quotations,"This book doesn't cost very much, but it doesn't provide a lot either. With only about 400 quotes in very large type, this feels like a supermarket checkout filler item. The reason I give this one 3 stars is due to the fact that most of the quotes are pretty good. So, it's the best of the 'Great Quote Series' but that's not saying much. Save your money and invest in the Random House Websters Quotationary instead."
3,Not enough background,"This is just a list of good quotes. The author should have offered a little background behind each quote, such as when, where, circumstances, speaking to whom, after effect. The book is so small I lost it, but I am not too upset."
3,Standard quotes...,"This is an ""impulse buy"" type of book, or a gift for a niece or nephew you do not know too well. The 400 quotes were OK, as others have noted. Too bad Anderson included Douglas MacArthur, but good for her for including Mother Teresa, who gave me a favorite: ""I am a little pencil in the hand of a writing God who is sending a love letter to the world.""The quotes were not dated, however, so you have no idea when in their lives these people gave them."
1,Overpriced useless booklet,"This is a total waste, overpriced booklet (not a regular book-size) containing old beaten-up quotations from a select group of leaders. I want my money back on this item. The price of this item should not be more than $1.99."
5,Open Up Your Eyes,"I don't think I could add more than the Julian Barham review except to say, I love this book! This is the fourth book of the jungle series. I would recommend that one read the jungle series in order (i.e., Government, Carreta, March to the Monteria, Trozas, Rebellion of the Hanged, General from the Jungle). It is not absolutely necessary to read them in order but some characters show up in the later books (e.g., Don Gabriel from ""Goverment"" is referred to quite often, and Andres from ""the Carreta"" is present in the March to the Monteria and Trozas, amongst others). The characters from previous books are not necessarily covered in detail, so having this background of info about them sort of solidifies the story. The path of the characters is intertwined throughout the series.I usually don't assign myself to such reading, like it's some sort of required reading for a class but in my opinion this is some of the most insightful and compelling writing I have ever read. Go Traven!"
3,Too short and superficial,"Too short and over priced. I bought this book in March 2005 for the list price, now that the price is reduced, it might be a better deal. Still expensive for a paperback of only 208 pages, almost half checklists and exhibits. It is authored by Hildebrandt International, which provides consulting advice to merging law firms. I felt I was reading a promotional brochure for the consulting service. There is some useful insight but at a common-sense level, not so much that is penetrating insight. Obscure topic, so if you want information you might have limited choices, hence my purchase. Another book (not purchased by this reviewer) Law Firm Mergers : Taking a Strategic Approach is also by Hildebrandt; why do they have two books on the same topic?"
5,TOWER OF POWER COOKS BEST ON THIS ONE,"If you don't own anything by T.O.P., this is one to start with. I own everything they have recorded and this is my favorite. I listened to this last night and decided it is time to buy it on C.D. I only have it on vinyl. It is one of those recordings. It stands the test of time. Any young Jazz musician coming up would say, WOW!"
5,See them Live!,"I won't regurgitate what is written already, this is just a kick-a** album!I really want to add they still tour, usually jazz clubs, and are a not-to-be-missed act. If you ain't moving when ""the Tower"" is groovin' -- you dead."
5,Pleased,The Iverson jersey is of good quality and when I expedited the shipment it really did come fast. In time for the surprise I had hoped to have!! Thanks! S.G.
5,Incredible history,This is a fantastic read about the discovery of the psychedelic drug LSD and the town that endured that horrific event.
5,So happy to find this!,"My husband had read this book decades ago, being a history addict, and found it very informative about illness and how it was viewed then. Amazing story of the source of death due to war - but not guns and weapons."
3,Where's Charles Kuralt?,"I was in bliss, paging through these journalism greats when I suddenly realized the author left out Charles Kuralt. As a journalism student, I'd so much rather read about beloved people like Kuralt than 15-minutes of famers like Matt Drudge. The authors even included his replacement, Charles Osgood. What gives, editors? Shunning him because of his affair?"
3,I think this reconstructor is great. My hair's ...,I think this reconstructor is great. My hair's texture improved. Great fragrance.
5,Love this product!,This product leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy. I've tried other conditioners and none leave my hair in such good condition. I also like Paul Mitchel products. But I love Aussie. I died my hair and it became dry and lifeless was splitting and dull. This product made my hair healthy looking and feeling again. Highly recommend it.
1,somethis is amiss here,Read the print this item ships at less than the product weight I suspect there is something wrong with how the item is represented in the photograph and what it is the actually send you. DO NOT BUY without clear description of what you are getting!
5,It really is a miracle,"I have very long, very thick hair. This is the only conditioner I have ever found that lets me brush out my hair without making tangles. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny without split ends."
5,I loved this product!!! It's so fabulous! I ...,I loved this product!!! It's so fabulous! I color treat my hair quite regularly so the luster is often missing. This product renewed my hair with the luster it had lost. It didn't weigh my hair down. I'd recommend this product to all people with lifeless hair. It takes the dry out and replaces it with moisture!!
4,I tried this product because I blow-dry and ...,"I tried this product because I blow-dry and curl my hair every day, which does plenty of damage to the outer layer of my hair. The first time I tried it, it made my hair seem heavy and bland. But after letting it """"soak in,"""" my hair looked great for the next few days! I'd recommend this product be used every couple of days, not every single day. I also like the """"Aussie-grape"""" smell of their products. I'd recommend it to family and friends with damaged hair, although I'd like to see it sold in a smaller bottle for people who wouldn't use it every day."
4,Good product,Good productthat I for my son but they item was alittle smaller then I thought it would be when it arrived.
3,It's ok... but not a good product...,I expected it was more durable than it is.... it's very 'plastic'... I hope the quality going to be better to rely in the brand next time...
3,good looking but flimsy,"They are definitely good looking but on the flimsy side. I have three kids (5,4 and 3 at the time of purchase) and they didn't last. their other cars (hot wheels or matchbox) never break down so I have to say, those are not very well built."
5,Awesome scent and it works!,"I have not been able to find this conditioner anywhere until I spotted it on Amazon. Because it's a spray mist, it's much easier to control where and how much I want to apply, which I like because my hair is fine and most bottled conditioners weigh it down, even after ample rinsing. This spray also enhances the highlights in my hair - I don't know why since it's not meant to do that, but I don't mind. The scent is wonderful and light. I purchased a 3/pk for about $11 with free Prime shipping so for now, I'm a happy camper! Thanks again Amazon....."
5,Love this product,I have used this product for years and there is nothing like it. You don't have to use any other conditioner. About a month ago I was having a hard time finding it in the stores so when I found it on Amazon.com I was thrilled and ordered it immediately. Having it delivered directly to my house was a lot better than driving all over town looking for it. If you want a great product give it a try and don't worry about it coming in packages of 3 you will love it enough to use that much.
3,meh,"I like changing up what i use in my hair... my responds very well to things whether they be good or bad.It had gotten kind of dry, so i bought some of the aussi 3 minute miracle deeeep conditioner, i use a little on my tips with my regular conditioner and it makes it sooo soft, so i thought why not buy this and seal the healthy hair deal!?well... I bought a bottle and have used it after every shower on damp hair for 2 months and it doesn't do anything for me.. it doesn't feel any more moist or smooth.. and it smells good in the bottle but it kinda has a weird smell once applied, at least to me... i don't see a difference so i won't buy again, I'll just stick to my usual creme leave in conditioner :P"
5,Wonderful!,"I have been using this product for several months and it has helped tremendously. My hair used to have lots of fly-aways every time I would blow dry it, and would feel rather dry. After using this it is much silkier and smoother. I went without it the other day and could see a huge difference. I only spray it about 8-9 times on my hair, and have had no trouble with it looking greasy.Also, I LOVE the smell! Spraying a little on a brush and then brushing your hair is a great way to freshen it up."
3,Changed?,"This used to smell like coconut, doesn't anymore. It used to get tangles out much easier than it does now. I wonder if the product has been changed? It's ok, but I am going to look around for something that works a little better."
3,Susie leave in treatment,"I was looking for a good leave in and this had pretty good reviews however,I do not like it, maybe if I was 13 actually I gave mine to my 13 year old niece. The smell is too fruity childish I'm 36 I don't want to smell that fruity."
1,not for natural hair,Really didn't do much for my type 4 afro even when I used a sealant with it. I wouldn't recommend for coarser hair types at all.
2,Didn't notice a difference,"I like Aussie products and they smell great tooWhen I got this in the mail, I was excited because I thought hey who doesn't like softer hair? and so cheap too!I used it for about 2 weeks and noticed that even though it smells like coconuts, it didn't do very much for my hair like I expectedInstead of soft and sleek as I was expecting, it was more like salt water hair lookI will still use it, if I want to appear like me and my hair have been to the beach but for shine and sofy and sleek I like the Dove hair serum they best"
4,"A nice-smelling, light leave-in","This is a very nice leave-in that won't weight your hair down or leave it greasy--that said, I think for people with dry hair (myself included), I don't feel it's enough to totally moisturize our hair like it needs to be. But this is a very good, every day leave-in that smells soooo good! I use it on my ends when I'm putting up my hair at night, and it works great!"
2,This product did condition my hair and make ...,"This product did condition my hair and make it softer. However, it made my hair too soft and flat. I guess this conditioner would be good for people with hair that's extremely hard to condition or short hair where it doesn't matter if it's flat. Using a leave-in conditioner did have the advantage of being quick and easy, though."
1,made my hair fall out,im african american with kinky hair andthis item was gr8 when i put it in but after like 30 min my hair began shedding heavily. i dont think i want to try other aussie products...lesson learned
5,The best,"I have used conditioning sprays by dove, loreal (costs $9 a bottle!) and frizz ease. This stuff is by far the best and only $3 a bottle at the store. I haven't gotten my hair cut since FEB and it is now NOV and I dont' have any split ends. I use it on my son too because he gets ""crib head"" or whatever it is called where their hair is all nappy in the back from how they lay on it, even though he is 2. This is the best priced and best working spray. I use sulfate free shampoo, skip the conditioner and just use this. I have naturally curly hair if that makes a difference, it is a tiny bit coarse, it isn't thick or thin. This stuff doesn't weigh my hair down either or make it oily, I still only wash my hair every other day."
5,Great to use!,"I'm becoming obsessed with hair products so now I always like to have something in my hair even when I'm not styling it. I love this product because it's a spray, and it's quick to use. It doesn't leave my hands sticky, and I can put it in my hair as soon as I get out of the shower. I use it before I use other hair products too. Plus, it smells really good!I mostly love it because it's a spray and not a cream. It's cheap, and I will definitely be buying this again when I run out."
1,The best thing I can say about this ...,"The best thing I can say about this product is that it didn't have that awful medicinal smell like most products containing tea tree oil. The package claimed to make hair shinier and healthier but after using it my hair looked dry and frizzy. In addition, my hair got tangled much quicker than normal. Perhaps if I used more it would have worked better, but the package didn't indicate how much to use and I thought I used quite a bit."
2,"My hair is very fine but also oily, ...","My hair is very fine but also oily, so normally I condition my hair only every few days so my hair doesn't get weighed down. The Aussie conditioner worked very well as a detangler -- my hair is curly and I always get a lot of tangles. It would be very good to use on children in the morning, since their hair becomes so tangled. I felt that it left my hair kind of dry and dull, however. I would use this product only as a detangler and in very small quantities."
2,This was less than what I expected from ...,"This was less than what I expected from Aussie. Usually their products are very good. This one didn't seem to live up to its good name. I didn't find anything really all that great about the product. It basically had no fragrance. It seemed to leave my hair somewhat softer, but I really didn't notice that much of a difference. Overall, the product was not that great. I don't think I would recommend it to my friends."
5,Great for ipad/ipad2,"I bought this to replace my flimsy Apple cloth and it works great, especially with my ipad 1 Apple case, it fits right under the flap. The package is actually two cloths a giant one, for maybe a large computer screen, and a small one, perfect for your ipad. All the edges are sewn to prevent fraying and you can toss it into the washer to keep it clean. I highly recommend this it is a must have for any version ipad owner."
5,Great Cloth Package,"This is a great cleaning cloth package because it comes with a large, durable cloth that I can clean my flat screen and laptop with; as well as a small travel cloth for my touch screen phone."
4,Screeen cleaing micro-cloth,"These relatively large micro-cloths work well to clean off my NookColor screen. Finger prints come off easily. However, if you spill something on the screen and it dries it may not get it off. For heavier cleaning you will want to use a liquid screen cleaner with them."
3,Grainy,Nice that it protects the screen but I do not care for the grainy appearance it gives to the screen.
5,Great Product,"This Kloth works extremely well dry, I'm Actually going to order another to keep in my travel bag. It is far better then any other cleaning cloth I have used. I have used this on an Ipad 2 and an HP Touchpad, and it works well on both."
5,The best screen/phone/lens cleaning cloth I have used,"This is without doubt the softest, most effective screen/phone or lens cleaning cloth I have ever used. It is a pleasure to touch (whereas some other screen cleaning cloths I have used actually have a rough feel and irritate my skin) and it cleans any screen or lens beautifully. I use it for everything: my Mac screen, our iPhones, our big screen LCD TV, my glasses, our binoculars. It removes grease and other marks easily and feels very gentle on any surface. Very highly recommended."
5,Clean Screen with Ease!!!,"Be assured that this chamois will not scratch or harm your LCD, Plasma, LED, or whatever TV you own.I Can take confidence and be rough on my screen cleaning now since it's a soft material that will keep surface from scratch!!!Microfiber is the way to go whenever cleaning you expensive electronics.Thumbs Up, love the cloth! XD"
3,LESSER THAN EXPECTED,"I was rather dissappointed reading this book.Altough It provides interesting insight to the historical aspects of Carpenter's work it lacks indepth analysis when attempting to comment on the films.I understand there's a well meaning effort here to address the average viewer and that is done successfuly,giving Carpenter the status he deserves,but to me Carpenter's movies are a lot more than that and some suggestions regarding some screenplay details seem to loose the point completely."
1,"IF YOU LOVE TO WASTE MONEY , THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!",this is one of the worst books i've ever bought. if you have ever read Fangoria magazine you would have gotten better pictures and more information on mr. carpenter. how can a book like this not go into detail about carpenters famous movie scores! the book is not complete for they don't even mention the made for tv movie ELVIS he made with kurt russell.better information could be obtained from dvd production notes.somebody please write a fitting tribute to a great director.
4,Survives the test of time,"I can't believe this book was written over 40 years ago, even before the Beatles first appeared on Ed Sullivan! I guess it only goes to show that technical analysis is valid and does work. Many of the patterns shown in today's books also appear in this book. Trends, moving averages, support and resistance, head and shoulders, double tops and bottoms were all known concepts back then. Candlestick charting wasn't known (in North America) back then and seems to be the only thing missing from the book.This book is a great introduction to technical analysis, well written, and a very good value for the cost. The book is still being printed and read four decades later is proof that the concepts are valid and worth reading."
5,Tremendously helpful detailing chart patterns,"Jiler does an excellent job of succinctly describing chart patterns. He provides numerous examples as well as detailing the pattern, its reliability and what the pattern means in regards to how trends should react once the pattern is completed. This book is very useful and I can see me reading it over and over again. This book belongs in every investor's library. I very highly recommend this book to any serious investor who wishes to improve his winning percentage through the use of stock charts."
5,Good Education,"If the current round of corporate accounting fraud hasn't awakened you up to the usefulness of charting, maybe this book will. After having tried a pure fundamental analysis approach in my investing for years, someone finally convinced me to look at charts, which I considered to be the same level as reading tea leaves -- au contraire. After spening the past two years studying technical analysis, I am happy to report that this is one of the better books on the subject, and inexpensive, too. This book, along with websites like TradingMarkets.com, will give you a fantastic basis in technical analysis."
2,boat broke,Me and my brother each got one of these for Christmas and when we put it in the pool and played with it for ten minutes it broke both of them now we have to return them.
1,"BAD BOAT, HAS HORRIBLE RELIABILITY","This boat is junk. I recieved a new one for christmas and took it to my lake to give it a try. I turned the boat on and placed it in the water, then once I tried to control the boat it took off on it's own in a straight pattern. I took out the batteries to the remote control and the boat kept going. I had to go fetch the remote control boat on a real boat. When I got it inside my house I noticed the boat pays no attention to the transmission from the remote control. So I had to take it back to Toys R Us because [...]"
2,rocker,This boat stinks!!!!!! I used it for a haif hour and then the rudder broke.I couldn't turn right.Don't buy this boat!!!
2,horrible,Do not buy boat i played with it for like a day at my friends. came back in a week motor got jammed and messed up. GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,J.O.,A must have for Raven Collectors. J.O. is O.K.. They could've made him bigger as he's a big guy in real life.
4,Good book for understanding ignitionsystems,Very informative yet fun to read.Helps understanding the funktions of the ignition and the different types.
4,The Reason N64 Was Made,This is the sole reason for the N64. If you own a N64 and don't have this game then you might as well not have a N64.
3,"Okay game, but not great.","My friend bought Ogre Battle 64 a few months ago, and loved it. But as i was watching him play, i soon got bored as the units he controlled took days to move across the somewhat small maps. I, have no patience whatsoever, but my friend has enough to train mice to speak english. In other words, to like this game you must be able to stand waiting for a while to get into the action, which is quite fun. Another downside is the game's storyline, which is quite odd and hard to follow. I would definitely rent this game, but not buy it."
2,Not a game for children or younger teens.,"This game was a real disappointment to me. The game contains a lot of profanity that frankly I would not like my children to learn. There is a warning on the box about mild language, however the language is worse than ""mild"" and it is used very frequently, within the first few minutes of game play on. The profanity is completely not needed and is way out of place in the game. Aside from this major complaint the game could be fun, though the game still remains somewhat tedious and dull."
3,"OK, for an ogre battle",Wow! I kind of think that this was really good. Maybe I'll find something tomake this better though.
5,Ogre Battle 64 Rulez,"I have played this game many, many times. Too many to count. If it is not apperant by the title of this review I think this is an excelent game. Because it is so long and has so many complexcities it has some great replay value. Gaining powerful units such as the princess and the dragoon is chalanging and fun, as well as mastering the chaos frame and creating perfect teams. The storyline is complex and includes a corrupt holy empire and demons from the other world, as well as rebels, slaves, love and much more. Awesome game, I highly recomend it."
1,Dull dull dull!,"Do not spend money on buying this DVD.Do not spend time watching this movie.I actually PURCHASED it from Amazon and sincerely regret such a thoughtless action on my part. Abhishek Bachchan's movies tend to be good, but this was TERRIBLE.Bad acting, bad story, bad music, bad clothing, just bad, bad, bad.No redeeming value whatsoever.Save yourself."
5,Rani review,"Rani is superb as usual, The team of abheshek and Rani are a wonderful teamI hope to see them in more films in the future. This is a movie to see.Love story at its best."
1,BEWARE! THIS IS A CANADIAN MAGAZINE,"Although it doesn't say so on the description page (unless you look at a large version of the cover!) this is for CANADIANS only! I made the mistake of ordering it for my US daughter-in-law and it's all about Canadian schools, etc. The subscription rate listed in the magazine is $17.95 CANADIAN funds per year. I paid $45 for something - I called and was told there is NO AMERICAN issue. So what's with the price listed here? What did I pay $45 for? Very irritating to say the least!"
5,Excellent!,Instructions absolutely clear. Lets students use knowledge of outside world. Wide variety of vocabulary. Allows students to discuss reasons for choices when checking answers. Excellent grammar patterns. Most useful Patterns to Remember sections. Very good reading comprehension questions.
1,Lin Lougheed,Lougheed's grasp of English grammar is at best arbitrary. The exercises in the grammar section are therefore replete with mistakes and irrelevancies which test the patience even of an intermediate class.
2,Meh,"I had been seeking to replace my Teva ""Maui Cowboy"" raffia hat with this. This hat arrived and is too small on my head, and did not have the thin band as shown in the picture. The raffia is supple, but the hat's shap is too vertical and not enough brim."
1,Nice but not very durable,"I like the way it looks, and provides relief fromt the sun. However, the wire around the edge of the brim broke and is poking through the straw. Only got to wear it 4-5 times."
2,hat,"The Raffia cowboy hat was not an adult hat it was a kid size hat. The desciption did not say it was for kids. The type of hat was correct but my granddaughter now has a new hat, she is six years old and it fits her.Not happy!!!!"
4,This was my first time I've used hair ...,"This was my first time I've used hair coloring and I'm very pleased with my experience. The instructions in the package were clear and I was able to follow them without any problems. A friend helped with the application and it worked very well. My hair is naturally brown, so the box said that it should lighten it and give it red tones. The color was fairly close to that on the picture. I'd have liked it to be a bit lighter, so I guess I'll have to get a lighter blonde shade next time. Also, I was warned that my hair may become dry after coloring, so I used lots of conditioner -- even though the box said there was conditioner built in. My hair didn't become dried out at all."
3,"Overall this product worked fine, however, my hair ...","Overall this product worked fine, however, my hair turned out much lighter than I expected. Though the color wasn't bad, it wasn't at all what was pictured on the box. Even so, it's easy to use and much better than """"spray-on"""" type of hair lighteners."
3,Symbols of the Church,"As a person interested in chuch banner-making, I was rather disappointed. While there is a lot in this little book, the pictures were too tiny (about an inch high) to be very useful."
3,pretty good stuff,"an extremely original story, funny, sick at times, but ultimately enjoyable...its not great, but definitely worth reading"
1,"Formula romance with shallow, superficial characters","This was recommend to me & I started with an open mind but the first sentence should have been a warning. She's gorgeous, her kids are perfect, her sheets and undies are silk - but she's losing the ranch. Puhleeze. The plot is transparent and predictable, the characters are stereotypes and no one elicits any interest because they're so mind-numbingly vapid. The heroine succumbs to that romance-novel ploy of being helpless - first a sprained ankle, literally on the first page, and then fainting from hunger, conveniently in the house of a man she distrusts but can't wait to go to bed with - for once, couldn't we have a woman with a BRAIN that isn't in her underwear? Skip this one - unless you like knowing the end after you read the first chapter."
1,Another publishing experiment gone bad,"I bought this because it had Texas in the title and wished I'd spent my five bucks on the lottery. A real yawner - she tries out every worn out plot device known to romance writers, you can see em coming a mile away, and I think her friends must be writing the good reviews - my reading ring hated it."
2,Low weight limit,In case anyone else was wondering about the weight limit for this bench. From the Body Champ company...Please do not exceed the following weight limits:- Weight Bench Uprights: Maximum 110 lbs.- Leg Developer: Maximum 60 lbs.- Lat Tower: Maximum 50 lbs.- Maximum weight capacity including the user weight and any of the above is 250 lbs.
4,This review finally showed me what to do,I have been trying to find the G-spot for years. Every one told me how to find it. It really made a difference to see the animations and the props. I could actually see how to move my hands. I tried it and it worked.Thanks
4,A teaching guide that really works!,"With the help of some video animation and real-life demonstrators, Dr. Linda Villers explains how to find the elusive G-spot, and what to do when you find it. I liked Dr. Villers' manner, which was pleasant and humorous but professional, and the video animation coupled with her words really allowed me to zero in on my own G-spot--finally! I also liked a couple of the interviewees, who seemed frank and reassuring in their confessions of cluelessness. I deducted a point because some of the sexual demonstrations seemed superfluous to me, and some of the demonstrators were a bit Boogie Nights for my taste. But this is personal preference. All in all, this video has taught me quite a bit, reassured me, and enhanced my erotic life."
2,There's gotta be a better G spot video out there,"There's a lot of unnecessary fluff in this 52 minute video, and it takes WAY to long to get to the main topic. Some of the info is helpful, but a lot of specifics were left out. There's got to be a better, more informative video on the subject. My advice---keep looking!!"
4,3 years later,and I still use this cleaver almost daily for food prep. It sharpens well and has a nice weight. The only con is the handle feels a bit thick. My hands are average size for a woman (I think) and if I'm using the cleaver for more than a couple of minutes the handle fatigues my hand.
3,All there is right now,"One of these days there will be a definite collection released on Mel Street. Until then, this will have to do.This is a budget line release with no info at all. No song or artist info is included. Plus I don't really like the inclusion of stuff like ""Bad Leroy Brown"" when I know there are better songs somewhere in the vault.But for what it is worth, all these songs are original recordings, and the sound is acceptable.But like I said, one of these days, there will be a deninate collection released, lets just pray it is soon."
5,In addition to David's review...,"I grew up in McDowell County, WV,and knew Mel from a distance, but knew more of the members of his band. And believe me, Mel was the real deal, and I truly believe the world of country music loss a great deal of exceptional talent when he killed himself. Those who never heard of him, or didn't care to...try it. If you don't hear real, true country...so close to what George Jones and the late, great artists like Lefty Frizzel offered...then you really don't know country at all. Listen to Mel, and you'll get a full, well-rounded picture of what country is SUPPOSED to sound like."
4,sweet design,"This projector is gorgeous!...very much part of the apple design scheme, gloss white, simple interface, motorized lens cover and motorized auto tilt( it remembers last used setting and tilt and keystone corrects to the same setting)....it is quiet but in high mode (to get the advertised 1800 lumens) the fan kicks it up and is loud. for the money this is an excellent deal...at least this month..."
4,Gift for wife,Seller did a great job with shipping and packaging. My wife is a Spandau Ballet nut. She was excited about the cd but then she realized that it only had 10 songs on it. She still likes it but wish they had more songs. I would recommend it to any fan of Spandau Ballet.
3,Okay . .,"I found the CD to be ok. After listening to ""True"" being played on the radio every two months, I decided to go ahead and by an album that had the track.I was, somewhat, disappointed because I expected a lot from the group. I thought since ""True"" was so good, there is a great chance I'll like a lot of their other songs. I've only listened to it once and was, somewhat pleased. I plan to listen to it a little more, but even this effort is uncertain."
5,Trippin' out,"ROAD TRIPPIN' BLUES is a remarkable two-CD set of traditional, Delta, Chicago (and even British) blues rendered by a solid collection of talent. Sound quality is excellent. No liner notes. Guaranteed to please connoisseur and novice alike. Highly recommended.TOTAL PLAYING TIME --DISC ONE -- 38:39DISC TWO -- 41:40"
4,More of Custard's Courageous Cowardice,"This sequel to The Tale of Custard the Dragon charms the reader with more of Nash's matchless rhyme. This is another tale of genuine courage expressed in a time of need by a habitually mild, timid ""little pet dragon."" In this story, Belinda is kidnapped by an evil knight, and it is up to Custard to rescue her from his evil lair.As in the first book, Nash's ironic, tongue-in-cheek hilarity is complemented by Munsinger's whimsical artwork. If told with a serious way, the story might be frightening to sensitive children, but the peppy, poetic rhythm and lighthearted images do much to lighten the potentially sinister mood. If your kids liked the original, this is sure to be a hit.This book is unfortunately out of print, but is widely available on the used book market. There is also another edition,Custard the Dragon and the Wicked Knight, illustrated by Linell Nash Smith, but it appears to be an expensive collector's item."
3,Cute story,"My 4yo son enjoyed this story and the role reversal between the usually fierce dragon and the good-hearted night is a refreshing twist, although my son doesn't really get the irony of the other animals teasing poor Custard because he is cowardly and then making excuses themselves for not going to save the little girl. . . . he just sees it as the animals being mean with no consequence. A little hard to explain, but an entertaining story overall."
4,My 2 year old loves it!,"My two year old can't get enough of this book. With its repetition and lullaby rhythms and its beautiful simple story. The images are very expressive, large and engaging too."
5,Makes my three-year-old laugh,"I borrowed this book from the library and when we got to the Mother chiding the elephant for waking her baby my little girl cracked up laughing. Later when I went over the books we read that night while tucking her in, she laughed just at the mention of the mother and the animals and then she begged me to read it again tonight. It is fun to read because you can put a little method acting into the begging the mother does, please don't wake my child!"
4,Colorful with an end to entertain,"Got this for my nephew for Christmas. A really nice Caldecott book, worth getting in the sturdy library binding to last in little hands. Excellent for sharing Thai heritage."
5,"Hush, ""Our Favorite Bed-time Story""! just Wonderful!!!!","Your children will love this story. It nicely introduces children to Thailand without boring them with facts, instead the story is wonderfully rhythmic and teaches animal sounds as it will lull your child into gentle sleep. It's Our Favorite!"
3,"Nice, for a 2-3 year old","A nice, simple little book . . . but my almost-4 year old was bored the first time through because of the heavy repetition. It would have been great before he turned 3, but not afterwards."
2,worthless,"This blind is very nice looking and was easy to install and fits nicely on my window. For that it gets two stars. However, as a window blind it is completely worthless. You can see right through it, it's like it's not even there. You can see through it completely without a problem and it doesn't filter any light whatsoever, doesn't even reduce glare. So if you just want this for decoration it is a good choice, if you actually want a SHADE for your window skip this one!"
4,Great ideas,Another terrific resource for organizing work spaces. Practical and usable tips. Have already started using some of the ideas in this book.
5,"I don't like Martha Stewart, but I love this book !","I don't know why but I don't feel comfortable with this woman and I don't have any background with her, since I come from France. I bought this book for $1 in a Japanese bookshop, just by curiosity, and I read it carefully.I must admit there are smart and simple ideas. The pictures are beautiful and it is well explained.I, of course, don't have such big houses as she has, but her ideas are useful even for small spaces. Nevertheless, she doesn't look more sympathetic to me now, because we don't really connect with her through her books, probably most of the ideas are found by a staff of very qualified people working for her, but it still remains interesting, neat, nice, smart, useful, elegant, convenient.I will keep this book for sure. I am surprised myself to love it, but I do."
4,Using Martha's Common Sense,"If I had never used even one of the suggestions/ideas in this book, it is beautiful to look at and wonderfully organized.Even the unrealistic (for me) ideas let me fantasize....not a bad thing!Martha Stewart's staff has compiled organizational ideas for every room of the house (and even rooms that most of us do not have). Many of the ideas are just common sense, but things I would not have thought of on my own. I had quite a few ""ah-ha"" moments while reading this book.I have used several of the ideas: for the broom closet, the office, the garage, and for folding those darn fitted sheets that always end up in a ball, it seems.I loved the picture wall, the fold-out windowsill, the armoire converted into an office, the herb ""pantry"", and the spice drawers.Now if Martha would just send someone over to make all these things for me!"
2,Not Martha's Best,"For anyone who subscribes to or buys Martha Stewart Living, save your money on this book. It is basically a compilation of past issues on homekeeping and organizing techniques. There are a couple of new ideas(or maybe I don't recall seeing them in the magazine) but otherwise I found this book repetitive of old ideas."
3,Good ideas but not enough instructions,"This book is loaded with tons of beautiful photographs of projects, however there are barely any instructions. Very disappointed, as I would like to implement some of her ideas in my own home but do not have the time to ""write my own instructions"" for any of these projects."
3,"Beautiful, inspiring, but NOT a manual!","I love the pictures, and they are a wonderful inspiration to get you started on organizing your space. There are also a few specific ideas that may prove helpful. But unless you are willing to spend a lot of money on containers, shop at endless flea markets, and most importantly, are already organized, this won't be a big help."
2,"Pretty pictures, not practical","If you want to see pretty pictures of nice looking organizing doodads, leaf through this book...but if you want practical tips on how to organize your space, pick up Julie Morgenstern's Organizing from the Inside Out."
1,"Very ""country"" style oriented","If you are organizing a place similar to her farmhouse, this book might be for you. I was very disappointed to see how few of her ideas would translate elsewhere--usually this is not the case with her books. Good Things was a much better book.I found only one or two ideas that really stood out from the rest--not worth the price of the book, especially if you get her magazine or mail order catalogue. Buy used if at all."
3,Not always practical for small spaces,"Very visually appealing and fun to read.Unfortunately many of the ideas are not cheap (for example, linen-covered boxes.) Also, this book is filled with good ideas for people living in houses, but many of the ideas are not necessarily applicable to people who have smaller apartments. Having said that, there are still many ideas that she uses are universal and can apply to any space.Not as strong as some of her other books, but still worth buying, especially if you have a house and lots of stuff to store."
2,Ok but don't waste the money,This would be a good book for maybe someone just starting out with an apt or marriage. Most of the items have already been discussed in her magazines.
1,Poor,"I thought this book would show me how to organise, instead all I got were pictures and if I wanted just pictures I could look at her internet site. Frustrating.Will have to look further afield."
5,"Really, really good","I thought this book was very good. The ideas were completely Martha-like, and quite simple. You probably wouldn't like this book if you are looking for a textbook of sorted ideas. This book is more of a book to give you ideas, not to offer information on every subject. Fortunately, I approached it with the former idea in mind, and I was very pleased with it. A really good book!"
5,Very clever and subtle,"I'm a process engineer by trade. Some ideas look obvious, but when you try them you see that they are brilliant. Martha understands usability and good design."
3,Decent book,This book is decent. I've read better Martha Stewart idea books. It's a little bit outdated (it talks about organizing video cassettes) and some of the projects require hard-to-find materials (men's suit fabric?) but there are definitely some great ideas and I don't feel like it was a waste a money. I just wish it were a little more practical.
5,Very inspiring,"I like Martha's ""Good things"" series, and this book is worth its price. When mine arrived I put four or five ideas into practice immediately--that night. I have since looked to it for additional inspiration and will continue to do so for years to come. Martha is not everything to everybody, and you just pick what you like to use and leave the rest of the ideas for someone else to use. In my case, this book REALLY hit the spot, as did the first ""Good things,"" which I have also used repeatedly."
3,Not to good,Although nicely set out and photographed nicely ... i do believe i only saw about a dozen new ideas ... less that I can use ...in a book with 140 odd pages
1,Overated and not very good,I bought this book and tried it but did not like it. There are better books. Try Conquering Chronic Disorganization by Judith Kolberg. I really liked that book and it solved many of my problems.
3,A bunch of old ideas in a new place,"I love Martha and think she has some fabulous ideas on how to clean up the clutter in your life! However, I completely agree that the ideas in this book are almost entirely made of up of ideas from past Martha Stewart Living magazines. If you really feel like you need these Good Things in one place to organize yourself, then buy this book. Otherwise, just skim through your old issues."
5,Good Things for Organizing (Good Things with Martha Stewart Living),Great book - inspired organizationat tips. Would buy again or give as a gift.
1,JUST PADDING HER BANK ACCOUNT,"My wife bought this book, so i decided to give it a shot. What I decided was that it was a waste of my time, and my wife's(my) money. Most of these ideas have been seen before. I think Martha is a very talented and gifted personality. I just think she's underachieving!"
2,Good ideas but not what I was looking for!,"Nice but I wanted more flexible ways than just Martha's AND should I be disappointed?? NO, because Martha is what Martha is ... her way!!"
4,Great down and dirty blues!,"When I read that Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones listen to these guys and consider them a great blues band, that was good enough for me to go out and buy this CD without hearing a single track beforehand. When I recently tried to order another CD by them, I was surprised and disappointed that they have no other releases. Are they still together? What's going on? Where are the Red Devils?"
4,Blown away in L.A.,I had the pleasure of seeing the Red Devils openfor John Lee Hooker in Los Angeles (1992). Our jaws hit thefloor. I ran out and bought the audio tape (1992).I wore that out and then purchased another. The harmonicaplaying is outstanding! A fine example of dynamics in ablues band. A must have.
5,Simply the Best,"I came across this album by accident. I saw it in a cut out bin at a local record shop and just decided to buy it. Man! I'm glad I did. This record is simply the best blues I've heard in a long time. It's raw energy with some of the best grooves I've heard. No one player in the band really stands out as a totally great, but the combination of all them together is awsome."
4,Even the Cone-In-The-Head Kid knows this is essential Dead,"My CD is an older one and could benefit from a digital remaster - I'm always fussing with the equalizer when I spin this one. Even so, I spin it often, and loud. And sometimes even hit the repeat. I couldn't live with out this collection. Many of the tunes appear again in '77 on What a Long Strange Trip, another CD I feel is ""essential Dead"". Still, each of these tunes are worth have multiple times. The Dead are young and sound real sweet here. And Jerry shows us how good he's got that guitar down now. It is a shame that we don't hear more Pig on his last tour, but we do get some - Mr. Charlie is a McKernan orignal... And Phil recently remedied the lack of really fine Pig tunes on CD when he put together ""Fallout"" for us.Here's to the Bolo & Bozo boys..."
2,not the dead's best work...not even close.,"yes, '72 was a great year for the dead. there is no way that anyone can deny that. however, europe '72 does a very poor job of capturing that sprit, that magic that was the grateful dead's 1972 tour. the singing? eh. the guitar riffs? monotonous. overall? pretty boring.if you want good dead, and you want it from '72, and you want it from europe, do not buy this album. buy hundred year hall instead. not only is it twenty-five minutes longer, it is also much, much better. like the second disc, for example, which contains truckin'>cryptical envelopment>comes a time>sugar magnolia and is in itself over 68 minutes in length. trust me...it's better."
5,Trip without the Ticket,"This album is an essential to anyone who wants to experience the Grateful Dead. Aside from Sugar Magnolia and Truckin', there are no popular radio hits on this album, and it's still awesome! This is a perfect place to start if you really want to find out what the Grateful Dead Experience is all about."
4,china cat sunflower!,"While I find Live/Dead to be a much more satisfying album as a whole, I cannot stop playing China Cat Sunflower/I Know You Rider. Worth the price of admission alone."
3,Doubled In Price. Literally. They WERE a good deal...,"I paid less than $26 for these. At that price, it was a great deal for exactly what I needed...some manilla mailing envelopes. Price is now closer to $50 and the price is fair at best."
3,Overpriced,Overpriced for a color book that you use daubers on. COuld have just used color book and 50 cent daubers from dollar store
4,+++THRASH+++,"Excellent old school thrash from Canada.It's a shame no one plays music like this anymore, except the old school bands who have reunited. By this album the band has added more progressive touches to the music. You could call this thinking mans thrash, the lyrics are also a step above average I'd say. Simply put, if you like fast crispy thrash geared toward the thinking man, Soldiers Of Misfortune should satisfy your thrash needs. This band was heavily under appreciated and never got the credit they deserved. This band influenced many in the thrash and death metal scene. I won't name any bands but I can hear some very similar riffing in songs. This band slays every nu-metal/metalcore/hardcore bands put together. This is real metal folks. This is not your grandmother's metal band."
2,A Light weight novel with little plot or character development,"I was disappointed with this novel which is set in my hometown of Chicago. I had hoped that the author would have taken advantage of this setting, but it really seemed as if he had just read one of our gay newspapers and pulled out a few names to function as place names. The plot is trite as are most of the characters. Characters change their ""stripes"" at the drop of a hat. The book has a certain fairy tale, and they lived happily ever after quality that I found really disconcerting. I would have been more ""satisfied"" if Dean (the main character) had turned out to be an ax murderer! Just kidding of course or am I? If you can pick this book up used for a couple of bucks, okay but don't you pay a penny more!"
2,disappointing,"This book was very disappointing. While I've read a lot of gay romance or love stories and have learned to have low expectations (which is kind of sad in itself), this book was really a disappointment. Dean, the main character is so annoying that I started to wonder why all his friends cared about him so much. He is always such a downer. He even needs to rely on his friend dying of cancer half the country away to help pick up his spirits. Because the main character was so one-dimensional, the rest of the characters just faded into the background."
3,Odd Editing,"The novel explores a unique and interesting group of relationships among ""friends."" Rarely has real life ever shown ""friends"" participating in Menages a trois so freely and with few complications. This fact, coupled with the atrocious editing, kept me from becoming engrossed in either the characters or the action. The constant repetition of prepositions in the same sentence was distracting and begs the publisher to hire a new editor."
2,DISAPPOINTING,Thought this CD would have had more popular songs since it featured 3 different artists... not so. I was extremely disappointed in this purchase.
5,Tons of Fun!!!!!,"We purchased this for our 2 kitties. It was a little confusing to put together, as we didn't realize you have to take off the round cover on top first. But as soon as it was all set up, they went crazy over it!!! It was the most hilarious thing to watch! Both of them continued chasing the black bird/mouse-looking toy on the end as it bobbed, spun, and flipped all around them for nearly an hour! This toy was a bit pricey, but we feel it was definitely worth it!!! We have never had a kitty toy that kept them this entertained and interested for so long! You won't be sorry if you buy this!"
1,Cheap Construction,"What a bummer. This item looked great, but it is so badly constructed. Within a few days, I had to use masking tape to make the blue wand stay on. Two days later, the spider or whatever it is came off the end, so I tied it back on with fishing line. Then, the wire clip that holds the spider came apart. The batteries wear out fast. The ball with sound is way to loud - terrified my cat. What as waste of $31 plus shipping. Worst thing is I am DESPERATE for a good automatic toy, as my kitten demands a lot of play and I need my hands to do my work."
1,Gave up after second unit received DOA,I have no idea if my cats would enjoy this. I never received a unit that worked. Gave up after the second one arrived DOA.
1,Sadly a waste of money,"Neither my 3 year old or my 6 year old enjoy this toy. I would have to say that this has been a waste of money and I would not recommend it to any of my friends to purchase. The most disappointing aspect I found was that the bottom has wheels on it that the manufacturer has not attempted to disguise so you can see that the puppy's fur has been put on like a dress. It is also too clucky to cuddle which my kids like to do with their toy animals, whether they move or not. Thankfully I purchased this for only $20 (including shipping), but even at that price, sadly I would still not recommend it."
1,NO-Go My So Dumb Rollin' Pup,"My 6.5 and 9 year old daughters each got one from their Aunt. By the end of the first day they were completely frustrated by the dumb pup. Was it because the dogs never ""learned"" their voices? Or the multitude of steps to TRY to get the pup to do its tricks? Was it the hard, uncuddly body on wheels? We all tried again the next day. It does LOOK cute, but less than a month after Christmas, they couldn't tell me where the No-Go Pups are. Probably hidden way back, under the bed. (PS Durability. It's sure to last a long time if nobody plays with it!)"
1,NOT SO FUR REAL WALKING PUP,"I had the pleasure of seeing my daughters face light up when she received her GO GO WALKING PUP on Christmas morning only to watch it turn to dissapontment because it would not work. Two weeks later the replacement arrived and again the joy soon turned to tears as this too sounded like a sick rap artist and would not move. She doesn't understand why Santa keeps sending her broken toys!!!!!So while this may have been the hot toy of 2003 it is no doubt the most over rated as well. Save your money, frustration and most all all your childs dissapointment and buy another toy or a real dog.Tiger Electronics got us with the Furby and now this useless furball..."
2,Piece of junk. Hard and not cuddly. Doesn't work.,"This is the garbage toy of the year. We're going to try to return it. The only plus is that it does look very cute.The fur is all stuck together, so attempting to brush the dog with the little brush that comes with it is useless.The toy is hard and heavy, so it's no fun to pick it up or put it on your lap to brush. It doesn't really have legs, just pads on the side that look like that -- it has an almost flat, hard plastic bottom with 4 wheels to make it move.Nothing works. It doesn't learn to come when you call it, unless you count rolling forward about four inches. I don't know what child would learn the silly things you're supposed to do to make it to things. For example, to activate grooming mode ""pet one of her sides, followed by her head, her back, her head, and her back once again.""Don't waste your money on this garbage. Perhaps the ones made by Hasbro are better, but we're not going to fool with it. If possible, get a real pet instead! :-)"
5,Great,Great I just loved this little dog and so did my grandchild. It was a great present and she sleeps with it every night
2,4YO better off with plush,"OK, it's expensive, rolls about 4 inches when you call it, it whines barks and growls, but can't seem to turn to your voice.She just picks it up and carries it, then puts it on her lap. The fact that it has wheels doesn't seem to make it less cuddly to her.They do still play with it occasionally, the toy is not loud, but the kids shouting at it constantly gets a little old.The way she plays with it,(and the way it actually works) a plush toy with a noisemaker would have been better, and about 1/2 the price."
1,GO GO A NO NO,"GO GO IS SO BORING FOR MY 8 YEAR OLD. SHE HAS MORE FUN WITH THE BOX IT CAME IN, WELL, I PAID TOO MUCH! SORRY GO GO, YOUR A NO NO...."
1,REVIEW SAVED ME $,"I am so glad I read these reviews! I was thinking of getting this for my 7 yr old for Christmas, but now that I read all of your thoughts I'd rather not waste the $$$$ THANK YOU!"
5,CHEAPER AT WALMART AND WALMART.COM,"this is a great toy, i have purchased 2 (1 for my daughter and 1 for my niece). if you actually look for a deal, (...)so, if you are trying to get a great toy and a GREAT deal, i would just buy it there...hope it helps, enjoy"
1,go-go my so fake walkin pup,this toy is fake you have to press buttons on its sides and back and everything you have to turn it on with a switch when you call by whatever you name it[i named mine sweetie]it doesnt come to you
3,Delving into insanity.,"I bought Go Go My Walking Pup, and when it arrived, I was overjoyed. Who wouldn't want a lifelike, walking pet that you'd never have to walk or neuter? I'm 31 years old, and I thought I'd seen it all. Boy was I mistaken. Besides the 8 AAA batteries, I found the Go Go Pup to be completely unfriendly to company and guests. In fact, he was downright hostile. The smell of smoke around the house was unwelcome, not to mention the so-called bukakke parties. I, for one, am disgusted. Mattel, clean up your act!"
1,I DO NOT LIKE GO-GO MY WALKIN' PUP!,"Okay, no offense to others who liked it, but it is STUUUUPID. I mean that as in it is brain dead. It's a robot with scratchy wire over its gears. In my opinion, I-Cybie is much better: We have one and have had it for three years and my kids and I still play with it! Go-Go, however, is sitting and collecting dust in the toybox. It is obviously strong, though, because if it runs into walls as much as mine did, it certainly would have broken if it wasn't. But educational...emm...I suppose if you took it apart the kids could become robot brainiacs LOL! But fun is a NOOOO. I have two girls, and 11 year old and a six year old. Neither liked it after the first few hours. Really, anyone looking for a dog that is closer to real, I would recommend something ELSE."
3,Disappointing,"Although Walkin' Pup is cute, you have to work very hard to get it to move more than a few inches. It's not cuddly at all. It seems to respond to any sounds, not just voices or commands. Also, it did not perform all the tricks the advertising said it could (example: chase its tail), despite working with it for some time. I wouldn't recommend this at all."
3,Real Dogs Are Better!,"I received Go-Go a few months ago from my grandma, who came to visit for a few weeks. She bought it because she thinks Go-Go looks exactly like her Shi Tzu, Snow White. She brought Snow White over with a red bandana on, and when Go-Go and Snow stood beside each other, I had to laugh. They actually looked alike!Go-Go's a fun toy to have. But it's a little bit on the boring side. When the price goes down, I'd reccomend to buy one. I've already been disappointed with my Furreal Cat and kitten I spent a total of over a hundred dollars for both in all. Personally, I think Snow White is funner."
3,Ishould have listened to the reviews,"I just had to buy Go Go. My daughter wanted nothing else for christmas. I had read the reviews on this website and they were pretty much 50/50. So I decided to purchase it anyway.When she opened the box she was delighted. It was fairly easy to put in the batteries and the dog began to bark. It was very entertaining except you had to yell at it to get it's attention. It came to you, sort of. I think it just goes in circles. It would whine and bark incessantly and within in the hour we turned it off. It had lost it's luster.The only reason my daughter plays with it is because we purchased a Smoochie puppy and she has Go Go be it's mommy.Take your chances perhaps you will have better luck. But definately keep the box so you can return it."
4,Go-Go My So Real Walkin' Pup,"My daughter loves it, when she calls the puppy, it comes to her and wags its tail. It's kinda like having a puppy without the mess of potty training!"
3,REALLY FUN?,"This is a great toy as far as it goes. It already has wheels and movement so why not make it remote control. If we can have remote control cars,boats,planes etc why not remote control pets? I think girs,especially would love this. It would be like having a real dog. Come on Hasbro, you can do it! I think there would be a great market for this upgraded item."
1,Doesn't work,My 4 year old wanted Daisy for christmas. That is all she wanted. I got it at target and I was so glad to find it. Very hard to find. I wish I would have tried it before Christmas. She went to play with it and it doesn't do anything. I was so disappointed. She did't even notice. Now I am waiting for it to get back on stock so I can exchange it.
3,Its a Good Substitute for a pet,I just liked the way this toy is packaged and the features that it has
2,"Bought two, they both broke!","We bought two of these. One for our 2 year old and one for our 4 year old. They both loved them. We were very happy with them at first. These seemed to be just right for the ages of our daughters, not too complicated, and it didn't seem to matter to them if the dog actually came to them when they called it. One thing that I disliked was the hair on these was always a mess, and they don't look too cute unless the hair is kept brushed. Eventually the hair became matted as well. But I have to say the worst thing about these is the fact that they both broke after only a few months. Now when we switch on both of them all they do is bark repeatedly like broken off tune records!"
2,An expensive let down,Both my girls wanted this SO badly and they played with for maybe 30 minutes. It does not work as advertised and is not cuddly to play with. Waste of a lot of money.
2,"Confusing, and not long lasting","After reading a review about the pup only lasting 6 months, I felt the need to let others know that ours lasted only 6 months. Now when turned on it just barks over and over like a broken record. Also, the commands are a joke, if you want the puppy to sit for grooming, stroke his head twice, his side once and then his back once. All of the commands have such rituals, too much for young kids (and I certainly couldn't remember them all) I think I will try Daisy this Christmas (as my daughter asked for a new one). On a positive note, until the dog broke, my daughter loved it. Oblivious that the dog did not follow any commands she gave it."
4,Great to learn about life as a paleontologist,"This is a great book if you want to understand life as a paleontologist. Novacek goes into detail about his career, the struggles in the field, and adventures. This book is great for a younger person considering going into paleontology to be aware of the highs and lows of the field. It is also interesting for those of us who are older and always dreamed about going into paleontology.The one warning I have is that the book is a bit long. While Novacek writes well, it is over 300 pages."
3,Not bad,"Not a bad book, could have had more illustrations and examples of fossils found in different parts of the world."
4,Mr. Lee Brings a Coastal Community to Life,"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Lee's book. He has seamlessly melded the figures and facts of the flora, fauna, aquatic creatures, people and history of the Buzzards Bay region with stories, essays and reflections that reveal Dan's intimate knowledge of and obvious love and respect for the land and it's people. The characters and landscapes are painted in such a way that the vignettes of people and places often read like a great peice of fiction. Dan's ability to introduce the reader to and bring the sights, sounds, smells, feelings and images of Buzzards Bay to life is astonishing. Anyone who has interest in any coastal community will enjoy Dan's insights and the artistry of his writing."
1,Huh?,"No movie description, but we get two lists lists of the two main actors. 15 min. running time... Really? Apparently no one's minding the store. I guess paying customers are unwanted."
1,Not for an iPAQ,"I bought the Sumdex GLP-807 Leather Bi-Fold Wallet for Pocket PC expecting to use it with an iPAQ 3670, the smallest PocketPC. The printing on the package was showing a Palm V. A sticker on the box said it fits iPAQ, HP, ect.While it may or may not be big enough to fit a naked iPAQ, mounting requires a Velco patch. No way was I going to apply directly it to the iPAQ for fear the iPAQ will not fit into the PCMIA jacket with the Velco. So I put the iPAQ in the thin (no slot) stylepac and tried to fit it to the case. Way too small. Looks like a good case for a PALM V using the built in rail but not for a PocketPC."
2,A loosely tied collection of idioms with little elaboration and insight. Not helpful at all,"If you just want to read plenty of idioms from Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Shakespeare, Churchill, Patton and so on, that's okay. If you want to apply their sayings to your corporate life as promised by the book title, you will be very disappointed by the minimal amount of elaboration and sheer absence of insight. Sorry to say that the author just attached many quasi related sayings to subjects like discipline, training, morale, HR, operations, logistics and so on to make up the book. I would strongly recommend you to give it a pass."
4,This is a really good pair of running shoes,"I really liked! I always liked Adidas and this shoes are very comfortable, light weight and has very nice colors. I recommend it!"
5,good condition as description,"The book cover is different from the pic. But it's ok for me. I like this book, and price is nice."
3,Art essay for beginners,"My major study is theory of art. Herbert Read's [The meaning of Art] is about art, aesthetics, art institiution, and principle conceptions like 'Golden section', 'Pattern', 'Form', 'Empathy', and 'Content' and so on. And this book very small size and including picture. For that contents, this book is good for beginners but not fit to major students, so to speak, students majoring art history. Read is also famous for art theory educator in the world. the writing is so easy to understand for that reason. Half of contents composed of simple explanation of art history and Big artists like Van Gogh, Picasso, Kandinsky. If you believe you're layman concerned to art, Choose this title and Recognize 'the meaning of Art'"
3,Easy like Sunday morning,"With Black Betty, Mosley delivers what you'd expect from an Easy Rawlins mystery if you came to it having already read a few others such as I had. The crime to be solved is made to seem convoluted but ultimately turns out to be relatively simple. But as with each book in this series it isn't really about the plot. It's about Easy's singular way of seeing and evaluating and dealing with the people he encounters along the way, his perspective on a period of time that seems both long ago and immediate. His character is further fleshed out with each novel, and going along for the ride with him on the particular case he's working on is always a pleasure. If you enjoy the writing of Raymond Chandler you'll probably enjoy that of Walter Mosley and vice versa, only with Mosley you get an added dose of social commentary, not to mention Easy's psychotically entertaining buddy, Mouse."
3,Everyone seems ready to shoot and kill in this book.,"I read this book with my book club. We agreed that everyone just seems so mean to each other in the story. People kill each other left and right until you begin to wonder who will be left standing at the end. Speaking of the ending (don't worry, I won't give it away), I was distressed and disappointed that things did not work out the way that I hoped. Plus, the killer just seemed to come out of nowhere and have no real connection to the other characters. I'm amazed by how many answers to Easy's questions existed right under everyone's noses. I do enjoy mystery, but I prefer Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned and Gone Fishin' by the same author."
3,"White Butterfly, others better.","I love Walter Mosley's work and have read almost everything he's written. I found Black Betty to be extremely dark and mediocre. I understand Mr. Mosley had recently lost a family member when he wrote this.It didn't have the author's normal existential optimism in the main character, Easy Rawlins, and I felt strangely empty and saddened by this work. Skip it for some of Mosley's newer, more profound work. A great writer with an unlimited future and unparalleled legacy."
3,A disappointment,"I only found out recently that there were sequels to The Good Earth and so I was anxious to read them. I was really disappointed in this book, it just did not really go anywhere. This book did not draw you in as the first one did. I could not get involved with the characters and it seems as if Ms. Buck was just trying to move the story along. I do not plan on reading the last of the trilogy."
5,Interesting from Page to Page!,"An absolute and thoroughly interesting saga and drama of the sons of Wan Lung. The book mostly follows the life of the departed son, Wang the Tiger. His mission is to have his own army and a son of his own. Pearl S. Buck skillfully details Wang the Tiger's desires, emotions and thoughts. Wang the Tiger removes his son from his sisters and mother to ensure the lad's education and guidance & preparation to follow Wang the Tiger's footsteps. This book is as excellent reading as ""The Good Earth"" and completely to the end!"
3,Worth the read,"This book gives a look inside the working man of China and his struggles during the revolution before Communisn, and the dynamics of a particular family."
3,Nice read,I got this book for my wife she loves Pearl Buck.She told me she enjoyed the book but didn't like the ending.
2,49 pages missing!,I was enjoying this book until I came to page 194. The next 49 pages are missing! It will take 1 to three months to recieve another book.
5,"Sons, Pearl S. Buck","If you love history of China, you will love this book and all her others. Once you start reading them, you can't quit."
3,Good Story,"I thought it was a little slow but I enjoyed the book. A must pre read is "" The Good Earth"""
3,So-So,"It is not as good as ""The Good Earth"" and I got tired of reading about the antics of the sons. I doubt I will read the last book in the trilogy.n"
3,not at all bad,"while the songs on the disc are fun and relaxing, some seem to have yelling than yodeling in them. thanks."
3,Too much yodeling??!!,"I never thought I'd say it, but there is such a thing as too much yodeling on one CD. Ranger Doug and the boys are fantastic yodelers, but the selection on this CD just gets a little bit repetitive after a while. Sorry, saddle pals, but I prefer it when you mix things up a little more, as on ""Harmony Ranch"" or ""Horse Opera.""Note this CD is a compilaiton of tracks from other Riders releases, some of which are out of print."
3,Need lots of room,"As with the other HotWheels action sets, you need plenty of space to play. The arm swings and drops the cars into the mouth of the Cyborg. It is a great action for the kids. They have to hold down a track switch button to make this happen. The track jumps around a bit with the cars racing around. There isn't a ""secure the base"" spot as with the other track sets. You have to tape the base down wherever you can. It takes up lots of storage space as it is very tall when set up. My kids are under age 6 and both love to play with this toy."
3,Not as good as it looks,"My 5 yr old son wanted it as he saw it. But after we put it together(1 hr work), the ""swing"" didn't work. It couldn't reach the monster's mouth. The cars could never reach the top of the tallest track. Besides, the cyborg's head didn't close very well. Any slight move would make it open. The yellow one of the two hot wheels was too light to do the loop trick. None of the other hot wheels that we have worked for this playset. I guess the weight of the hot wheels is quite tricky for this playset.Well, my son feels disappointed about the ""swing"", but he still likes it. However, I wouldn't recommend this playset. You can't do much with it."
3,Takes too long to put together,"If your child is like mine, the novelty of this toy will wear off when the first set of batteries wear out. It takes up a lot of space, and after taking 2 hours to put together -- it's not something you want to put together/take apart. It has no educational value -- other than teaching your child patience while you try to make head or tails of the ""instructions,"" but the intention of this toy is not to educate your child anyways. If you purchase it, like I did, because my son fell in love with it after the advirtising blitz on tv, just remember to set aside a chunk of time, and aspirin, when assembling it."
1,Lasted only one day,"After an extensive assembly, my 4 and 5 year old boys loved the track. It is quite clever in design. However, before the day was through, it broke. We were all very disappointed."
1,every star is a perhaps wrong awnser except no3. ASSULT!,Im sorry. i don't own this toy. but the word assult is a bit drastic. i mean hot wheels has had crappy sets with bizzar names but assult is just the tip of the iceburg! whats next: Hot wheels super speedy cage of rape! Hello! assult is a word used in cort because of wrong behavior!
4,it looks like alot of fun,i just orderd the cyborg assalut yesterday. so i dont really now how it is it looks fun and durable. it reminds me of my serpent cyclone which i got for christmas last year and i still have tunes of fun so i think i will have fun with this toy
1,Disappointed!,"My 6 year old son was convinced by an older friend that he ""had to have it"" for Christmas. Well, we got it and man what a dissapointment. First, the track does not stay together. He mixed the race cars in with his other cars and now we cannot find a car that will go through the loop( I didn't get a look at them first). All in all, a simple race track is what we should have gotten him, and this set was all just cool packaging... perhaps for an older child (10 or 12) who can maintain the track on their own, but not for little guys. It is just too frustrating, and now we have this attractive skeleton head in our living room gathering dust.Don't bother!"
1,Spare yourself the misery,"My son spent his long-saved allowance on this toy and is sooooooooooo disappointed. After what seemed like hours assembling it (I've never felt such frustration, frankly), this piece of junk doesn't work. The tracks were extremely hard to line up properly. The cars don't go through the loop. The arm works the first time the car goes through it (usually), but once we open the cyborg head and manually (!) push the car through, it has nowhere to go successfully. It doesn't make it through the loop or up the arm ramp as that hasn't re-aligned itself (you have to do THAT manually, too). Please save yourself the annoyance, frustration, time and money!! How cool this toy would have been had it worked, too. :("
2,ours doesn't work well,My son just had to have it. It's took a long to time to put together but I thought it would be worth it when we finally finished. We tried the ramp and the car flew right out the top. Good thing no one was there to get beamed by the car. It continued to do that when if finally decided to break off the whole top ramp. So I called mattel to to ask them if I can get some assistance but they told me they can't and they will send me a refund voucher if I send them back the power booster. I was disappointed coz' it would've been so cool if it worked like it was suppose too. My son will be bummed out.
2,This never worked for us,"My five year old son received this as a gift from a relative who shall remain nameless. On Christmas day we painstakedly assembled it. The thing is pretty large and spread out and takes up alot of space. (there was no way I would disassemble it for a while after the amount of time I spent putting it together!) Anyway, the cars would get stuck at the Cyborgs head, that track option NEVER ever worked. The other track option of just the loop-to-loop worked fine. Three days later the looped-to-loop failed and hasn't worked since. The cars never got enough momentum to loop. We tried changing the batteries to no avail. Now I have a very cool looking but nonfunctioning toy that was a huge dissappointment."
3,cyborg,"My five year old loved it. It is one of the better tracks. You have to find the right cars,most of the hot wheel cars we had were to heavy."
3,Still going after 3 months,"We got this for our 4 year old for Christmas. Daddy (me) puzzled over the assembly, and it took a while to get it together.Once it worked, our son was thrilled and delighted by the action of the cars whipping around and getting eaten, and still plays on and off with this even 3 months after Christmas. More engaging than most toys we've gotten him.Part of the game, however, is that most Hot Wheels don't work with this, so a systematic search (passing/failing cars) is the main game he plays with it! Most are too heavy, so they wipe out before making the circuit. At least we found 4 (out of about 40!) that work - lucky for us, since the set needs 3 to make the cyborg open his head. He thinks that is great fun as well, and demonstrates it to each new babysitter.Now if we could only find a few more cars that meet the very limited weight requirements ..."
1,Awful!,We purchased this for my 5 year old son and what a dissapointment! We could not get this toy put together- and I even think some pieces are missing. (And this is coming from a family that spends hours doing lego projects). It went back the next day.
2,DOESN'T WORK AND IS DANGEROUS!!,"This race track took almost an hour to put together. There's a feature called the ""attack"" mode where you push a piece of the track down and the car is supposedly catapulted into a chamber and the arm of the track tips and is supposed to place the car in the cyborg's mouth where it continues to run on the track. THIS FEATURE DOESN'T WORK. We tried at least 20 times but could not get it to work once. The car travels too fast and hits the shield over the track and is thrown off the track. We were hit by this flying car several times. It's dangerous and hurts when you're hit. The creators could not have possibly thought this design would work. It's fundamentally flawed. DON'T PURCHASE THIS ONE!! Your kids (and you who paid too much for it) will be very disappointed!"
3,"Fun, but broke within 10 minutes","My 4 yr old son received this from Santa, and within 10 minutes of playing with it, a piece of the track broke. I tried super glue but it didn't hold, since the car hits it with quite a bit of force. My son loved it but hardly got to play with it. We tried exchanging it but the local stores were out. Also, the cyborg was difficult for my son to put back 'together' after it opened. And the cars didn't easily slide into the cyborg without a little extra help.We are very disappointed, as this is the main thing he asked Santa for."
1,Annoying and not usable,"This is the worst toy I've ever had the misfortune of purchasing. Putting it together wasn't too bad, but I have yet, after a good hour of monkeying with it, have to see a car go around the entire track once!Not only does it only come with 2 cars and require 3 to actually operate, but only a few cars will work with it at all.The track doesn't stay assembled, the swinging arm action only works some of the time, and the cyborg head doesn't open at all the way it should, requiring a good deal of intervention to work at all.A horrible, horrible toy, and I fully plan on exchanging this piece of garbage as soon as possible.What a waste."
1,Poor Quality,"This toy is fun if you're able to keep it working. We had to replace it 3 times before we finally just picked out another toy, a shame really because our son liked it but it became too fustrating. After a while the moter just gives out and can't push the car forward, also the long arm of the cyborg doesn't always work but that wasn't too big a deal. I'm not sure why but Hot Hweels quality just seems to be getting worse, are they just getting lazy or do they just not care about making good toys for kids anymore?"
4,Impressed!,"I was skeptical, it looked like a pain to put together, but a couple of the uncles were over and they actually had fun putting it together! We bought this for my 5 year old's son's birthday, and it worked amazingly well! He was able to run the track himself and close the cyborg's head, and I was very impressed. We have a 4 month old kitten and I think she likes it as much as my son! I didn't realize how big it was, so wherever you decided to put it together, that's where it will stay! I think it was worth the $."
2,Fun...while it lasted,"My 6 year old LOVED this track for the 30 minutes he was able to play with it. It worked great going around the loops using the cars it came with. He loved how fast it was! However, we piled about 5 cars into the Cyborg head and it STILL didn't come open like it should (after looking forever to find 3 more cars that would work). Also, a particular piece of the plastic track kept coming apart and I kept having to snap it back into place. After doing this about 5 times the cheap plastic gave and broke off completely. My son was very disappointed. (...)"
4,It's about time!,"At the risk of stating the obvious like a darn fool, it is a dictionary in every sense of the word. Arranged in alphabetical order, this book contains encyclopaedic entries on famous dancers, choreographers, dance companies from around the world, dance terminology and even composers like Charles Ives and Richard Strauss (whose music were used in miscellaneous dances). From Alvin Ailey to the Zurich Ballet, it serves as a quick reference for seasoned followers of dance, while pure beginners might get lost in the mass of text. Those into visual aids will also be utterly disappointed for there's none here. But on the whole, it's still worth the space on your bookshelf."
1,One of them broke,"Today I was using the #00 Philips head screwdriver from the set for only the second time--to fix an iPod. As I was pressing it into the screw, the shaft receded a bit into the handle and then started rotating as I was trying to turn the screw. I couldn't get any toque out of it anymore. Luckily I had an eyeglass type screwdriver around to finish the job I was in the middle of. I guess these are poor quality and will have to become my throw-away set for jobs that might damage things. I'll have to look in to getting higher quality ones here on Amazon."
2,Sexy Wedge For Sitting,"I ordered these shoes for a girlfriend as I prefer stilettos and heels over wedges. The shoes look gorgeous on her feet as I would expect from any J Lo shoes, but she complained about the tightness of the vamp on her toes after wearing them while standing and walking. I would recommend these shoes for a dinner date or to just sit and look pretty but not for dancing or events where you must stand and walk a great deal."
4,Check the O.R.,"If you have any clue who Organized Rhyme is buy this disc, its funny as hell. Tom Green is awesome, awesome to hear something from him again."
2,"Looks like fun, but...","My dad bought the kit so I went home and built it and I thought it was cool because the legs moved and it had CHEWBACCA! But the legs only shuffled but did not lift up over things. So it did nt really walk. It's like a TIE fighter that looks good on the shelf, but does not play too well. It plays well with Ewoks and Snowspeedrs, but I would like this better if I had an AT-AT to go with it."
5,experimental old school sound,this album make mi the same effect when I heard the second album of DIVINE STYLER spirr..1992.The direction that take JUNGLE BROTHERS in year 1993 was a surprise but it function I think it's the more underground album of JB's and the strangest for the hears electro sound very speed this is an old school def jux also if you love this style tcheck releasing hypnotical gaces of ORGANIZED KONFUSIONbuy it if you have a choice you need it
5,Sick Good,"Totally experimental. Beats change smoothly. Bridges go on too long in a good way and become vamps. Choruses come in at odd moments. A couple songs at the end are sick freestyle. There are great soul moments, funk moments, reverb/echo moments, turntablist moments, and even pure noise moments. Check out unprecedented ""Spittin Wicked Randomness"" and ""Jimmy Weighs a Ton."" This is genius stuff for sure."
3,"Works well, but .....","We have two of these units. They work well and humidify efficiently and quietly. I find them easier to clean than other humidifiers and like the fact that I don't have to buy filters that cost $20-$40 depending on the brand. I gave it three stars, because the fan mechanism seems to be poorly made. In both units the fan was defective and had to be replaced. The first did not engage the discs, while the second made a rattling noise. Venta sent me replacement parts without questions, however that should not happen at that price level."
3,Works but is noisier then advertised,"A very simple design that works humidifying a room but I am not so sure about the air cleaning properties. The special soapy mixture you use seems to collect an amount of dirt when it's time to replace the liquid but what does that mean? Replacing the fluid and cleaning the unit is more work then throwing out a filter but that's not a real problem.The unit is not bedroom quiet, at least for me. I eventually banished it to another room until I gave the unit away to someone with a two floor house. They are are very happy with it as it helps keep their musical instruments from drying out in winter. The aromatherapy option is very nice and works well.The price prevents me from recommending it. I have some $50 ultrasonic humidifiers that work just as well."
1,Incredibly overpriced and ineffective,"I just wish I had had access to these reviews before I plunked down the money for this product. Exasperated with buying and replacing filters, smelling mold, listening to noisy contraptions, I figured what the heck - I've tried everything else. Running full blast this thing couldn't even get the humidity in my small music studio up to 30% on a cold day here in a suburb of Philadelphia. As other reviewers have pointed out, you get no water level indicator, no shut-off when the water dries out, no humidistat to turn it on and off automatically. I could go on.I see that they're selling them used starting at $280. I'll give you mine for $25 with my undying thanks."
3,Good product + Bad service = questionable purchase,"Years ago I purchased an LW14, and I was happy. Recently I purchased2 LW24's and this is where the problems start. The manual instructsme to go to their web site to register, yet there is no registrationlink. I then emailed them 4 times at their customer service addressasking about this, with no responses. I called them numerous timesat their customer service 800 number, and I only can reach voicemail. I am not sure they are still in business; with this much troubleregistering the product I am very concerned if I even actually needwarranty work nobody will be there to assist. I cannot recommendthis purchase."
2,Very low output,"For the price, I found this to be a very poor choice. It is attractive in it's simplicity-all plastic parts. After a second winter, I have come to the conclusion that it actually achieves next to nothing in terms of humidification. I threw it in the trash yesterday. Enough said."
3,disappointed,"I recently bought the Venta Humidifier LW 24+ !I find it too noisy at high speed for a bedroom. At mid speed the unit evaporated less than one liter of water during 16 hours, much less than our old unit.My expectation was as high as the price. The performance not worse the difference in cost with more conventional units."
3,"Not exactly what I wanted, but OK...","I had a fantastic Sears Kenmore with a rotating belt evaporator that had to be replaced only three times in 15 years. An Emerson replacement required new filters frequently that turned into mush after a month or two. For some reason the humidifying method that Kenmore used and which worked beautifully is no longer available. The problem with this unit is it's low capacity and high price. I have to keep it next to my bed; the Kenmore effectively humidified the whole house.If the thing didn't have a little annoying rattle, it would very quiet and it does have a quality appearance. It's clear to me that a good humidifier is still hard to find. Remember how the Japanese came in and replaced all the old clunky American table fans 40 or so years ago? It's time someone came out with a decent humidifier for not a whole lot of money.Venta may have a good idea, but this isn't IT yet. This isn't rocket science."
3,Disappointing for the price,"I was hoping that this would be a nice quiet humidifier for my bedroom because I am easily awakened by noises at night. Unfortunately it has proven to be quite noisy and often has a loud ticking sound coming from the fan. I've tried oiling it and that seemed to help for about two days and then it gets consistently louder. One other thing is that the light on it is extremely bright and will light up a dark room. I fixed that by putting tape over the top. At this point I am not sure what to do with it, I'm getting annoyed with being woken up by it every night so I may need to move it to another room. For the price this humidifier should be whisper quiet.Also, I'm actually not sure if it is really doing a good job as a humidifier. I only have to fill it about once a week whereas all of the other humidifiers in the house need filling every other day. Overall I am pretty disappointed with the product."
5,Much better than Air O Swiss unit it replaced,"About a month ago I bought Air O Swiss 7144 Ultrasonic. First, it left white dust everywhere. I live in the Southwest which is known for having hard water but the level of dust in itself would make me return in. The Air O Swiss also had an issue regulating humidity. The air felt humid, not clean. So I returned it and bought this. What a difference! The build quality on the Venta is notably better. Seems much more solid and I like the fact that it can be left on the floor (sorry Air O Swiss, but I don't have any spare 3 foot tables around my house to elevate your unit). It is somewhat annoying that the Venta doesnt have a way to view the water level without opening the unit but once you get the hang of it you'll know when it needs water. The air feels notably cleaner and more fresh. Dry skin is gone. Very please with it and plan to buy another unit soon."
4,useful and versatile!,"nice, nesting set of three versatile bowls. durable, washable, microwaveable. every kitchen needs 'em or something like 'em, no?"
2,Dissapointing,"I must say I've only been playing guitar for a little over two years. This book has not been helpful to me in any way. The other reviews about needing about 1 year of is experience are wrong, I could have pulled this off easily right away, because the book moves at such a slow pace anyway. This book will only teach you the basic pentatonic and minor scales, I wouldn't recommend it for a player with a lot of experience, but it would be a great book for beginners! *Note: Do not get this book if you have an acoustic guitar, and not an electric!*"
2,After the Dawn,We wanted this movie because it was filmed in our hometown. The previews showed my brother-in law's bakery. That scene was cut. It was rather boring. It was a terrible movie.
5,Terrific !,"Laurie Keller has a real winner here. Silly, funny, with humorfor everyone in the family and a lesson and message about teeth yourkids will never forget. There's even a fun quiz at the end that kids will love. The colorful, clever illustrations compliment the text and add to the joy of this book. You'll be reading this story over and over again. There's so much going on in Open Wide Tooth School Inside, your kids will never tire of it."
5,A Creative Way to Learn About Teeth,This book is an awesome read. It presents teeth facts in a fun and exciting way. My five year old loves reading (what she can) and having this book read to her; especially the little side notes from the interacting teeth. She even loves the silly joke about the difference between a good dentist and a bad one. I actually learned a little bit about tooth history as well; it clarified information regarding George Washington's teeth issues. It's a good book and I'm glad that I got it.
5,It's our Bedtime Story Book,"I am a school nurse that teaches oral hygiene. I use this book constantly for every grade level, even in my pregnant minor program. My 5 year old daughter loves this book as her bedtime story book, and has learned more about teeth then most adults. She loves the little side-talk of the different teeth. A fun and entertaining way to introduce oral hygiene and the ramifications of not brushing. I even gave a copy to my dentist! Julie Hart-Lawson RN/ San Diego City Schools"
1,Don't Bother,Bored by daughter and god-daughter. The animation looks really cheap and sparse. The story is confusing and awkwardly unfunny. The Bratz movies are getting really weak.
1,Broken bands,"I used mine for 3 weeks, and both the feet and hand grips broke from the cloth material. Very poorly made."
1,Poor quality!,"These bands are effective to use with the Reebok workout and also for Billy Blank's DVD's. They are effective.....for about about TWO WEEKS and then....SNAP! I paid $19.99 for my bands and I'm going to return them today! While doing some bicep work and pulling the bands above my head, the band snapped from the handle. I now have a large red welt on my upper back!I do not recommend these bands to anyone! Save your money, or at the very least, save your receipt!"
4,Nice bands prefer a removable middle piece option!Thanks!,"I love the idea of theses bands, I have been doing Tae bo for a few years now, and I love it, ut it's nearl impossible to find the bands now. These will work, however i wish there was an easy way to remove the middle plastic peice. I will have to break it off. Otherwise their great, they could use a tightening option as well.Thanks!"
1,Not impressed,"The whole ballet takes place in a dark blue scenario that does not change throughout the 146 minutes that lasts the ballet...I bought this CD because I could not find the Raymonda's version directed by Mikhail Nikolaevich Baryshnikov with the French ballet in the 1980s.Well, the lack of color in this CD version of Bolshioi Ballet under the direction of Alexander Glazunov was a big disappointment. There are times in which you feel like you are watching it in dark blue and white...As I write this review I read the description in the back of the CD case that says ""filled with melody, color and grand effects,"" well, this is just not true. It was filled with blue and gray colors. Ok, blue and gray are also colors. I'll give you that.Ballet is a spectacle. Color is a fundamental component of an spectacle Mr. Glazunov"
2,Avoid this one.,"Being a huge fan of Van the Man, I thought he was infallable. I was wrong. It's not that the production, the lyrics, or the instrumentation is bad, there is just a severe lack of energy. Van just sounds like he's not trying on this one. Both Snow in San Anselmo and Warm Love are excellent and Wild Children is ok (the definitive performance is on Too Late To Stop Now). The rest is just bland. If you are just starting your Van collection get Astral Weeks and Moondance NOW (ignore all roadblocks and traffic signs)!"
2,What happened?,"I'm a big Van fan, but somehow the charms of this album escape me. Of the 20+ Van records I have this is easily my least favorite.Musically, it feels lazy and unispiring. The lyrics are strangely mundane and ""American"" for Van Morrison. I don't think there is a single essential song on this disc.That's not to say there are no enjoyable songs, just that there is nary a hint of Van's usual genius. Thankfully, the genius would soon return in spades for ""Veedon Fleece"". This is for Van completists only, an unfortunate sidestep on his way into the mystic."
4,An under-appreciated mellow Van gem,"A 4 star Van album; 4.5 for anyone else!It being October, the mind turns to fall, and that to me is usually accompanied by a few spins of this wax.The whole Hard Nose record has the relaxed joy of a colorful and happy October day, and not only due to two classic fall tracks, Purple Heather and Autumn Song. Bein' Green and the rest also slide down deceptively easy; there's a lot of emotional and musical depth on quiet display here, and Van's voice reaches its mellow peak, and never really gets much sweeter than this as his recording career goes on.Some great lyrics, too; Snow In San Anselmo is both beautiful and funny---the string bit illustrating the speeders is always a smile. The title track is another standout.In fact, there's not a weak moment on the album, and some very strong ones.Check out Purple Heather; no one else ever touched Van at this kind of reading. The man can sing a song and really make you feel it."
4,hard journey,"Van Morrison / Hard Nose The Highway: This is a good, not great, album from Van Morrison. There are a couple of wonderful songs here, but the rest are just ok. This album has just enough good stuff to get four stars."
4,Rinse,"The band is great and van sounds fresh like irish spring. ""Purple Heather"", ""warm love"" are songs to look for."
3,TOO MUCH SHIPPING COSTS,Very nice cleaning kit but $8:00 shipping fee on $6:00 item takes away the value
4,concise introduction,"This book is a precise and concise beautiful introduction to the poetry, the text, the philological issues, the history and the 'Homer-question' of the Illiad and the Odyssey. By 'concise' I mean up to the point that satisfies a non-specialist reader without burdening too much details. This book serves the purposes of a specialist reader and an outsider as well with good bibliography. However the philological problem may not have been introduced at the beginning, on the contrary the section on ""Readers' Homer"" may have been the choice for the first section. However that may be the author's choice as he is an experienced professor. The classroom experience must have been the reason for this. I myself has been on the look for just this type of introduction on Homer."
2,2 stars,"Waste of money: it needs organization and a focus. There are others much better out there. I would recommendPIC in Practice, Second Edition: A Project-based Approachinstead"
1,"deceptive title, read description VERY carefully!","READ THE DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BUY because the way the seller has described this item as a 3.5 to 2.5 adapter is deceptive. the description further states that it has a 2.5 female and a 3.5 male, which in my experience is actually a 2.5 to 3.5 adapter.if you have headphones with a 3.5mm jack and want to be able to plug those headphones into electronics with 2.5mm port, this is NOT the product for you. this will take your headphones with a 2.5mm jack and allow you to plug them into electronics with a 3.5mm port.thank goodness it was cheap, because it's totally worthless to me."
2,More Info WOULD Have been NICE!,"I wasn't thinking when I bought this one. I needed a 3.5 male to a 2.5 female, which was not what I was given. I will admit though, that i did't look for all my info, but the seller should have made such basic information available."
1,wrong item,I have been looking for a lg female to small male plug to work regular headset with my phone. I was mislead by your ad. price was good and arrived quick. if you have the reverse item let me know i will order one.
5,A must for any Word or puzzle fan!,"This book worths 6 stars. It contains a glossary of ""special"" words and interesting charts of words, in the puzzle and the-word-it-self sense. For example, what is the longest common word containing most consecutive letters in the alphabet after letter c? You can look up the glossary and find the answer is ""disenfranchising"" What word repeats most s's? the answer is possessionlessnesses. For a word or a puzzle fan, this is a must. For common readers, even merely skip some pages, you can wonder at so many words with its special property."
3,Puppet Stage,The product was good but beware of the size as the picture makes it look larger than it is in reality.
4,Fun for all ages,This stage is well made and fun to play with. My only complaint is it doesn't stand up all that well so you will need to prop it up. My 3 year old daughter was delighted to open this up with her finger puppets for Christmas.
3,Glad to hear he's alive,"I must admit I was a huge Hooters fan; I have all their albums and only had the opportunity to see them once. So, I was disappointed to hear of their demise, especially because their last album was one of their strongest. Anyway, I was very eager to hear Eric's solo effort. There are some very good songs on The Optimist; namely U.G.L.Y, Until You Dare and Driving in England. The rest are average to good. If you are a Hooters fan the 3 strong songs are alone worth the money. In listening to the rest I just feel that this album lacks one thing: Rob Hyman! They made such a great team and complimented each other's work so well. I will still look for any solo efforts that either of these two make do but I really wish they would put out some collaboration."
1,Most frustrating pile of poo I 've ever seen,"This game was cool in theory. Blood, chaos, violence, great sountrack (ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU CAN OMIT THE LOUSY I.C.P., TWIZTED GARBAGE SONGS!) BUUUUUT, its way too frustrating to play. You start off getting beaten and thats about it. There is no easy, beginner starting point, just yer backside getting handed to you. I didn't like it (in case you couldn't get the hint) Bought it, opened it, played it for 10 minutes, boxed it back up and returned it. That sums it up. Don't bother."
3,Okay,"This game is alright. Ignore the title, this has very little to do with wrestling. It's more about picking up something and bashing your opponent over the head with it. There are wrestling moves, but they are way to easy for the A.I. to reverse. Here is the main problem with the game. The A.I. The computer does to many cheap things. You will be in the middle of a combo, and they will just do a grapple move on you, making combos almost obsolete. And the objects that they throw are homing missles. When was the last time you saw a T.V. or bike follow you around in a circle while in midair? Never. Not until this game. And the animation for the moves isn't very good. They try to look exagerated like Def Jam Vendetta. And the game is also wicked fast. There is no way to walk, all you can do is run. And the talk show mode only takes 20-30 minutes to beat. Overall, rent it, see if you like it. Even if you do like it, it is not worth a purchase."
1,Wrestling in a Fantasy World,"A very interesting concept. Eidos deserves kudos for the sheer creativity of setting Backyard Wrestling in a some sort of alternate universe. A wonderul universe were weapons curve mind-air to hit an opponent, where massive 3rd degree wounds hurts less than getting smacked in the head with a basketball, and a universe where ICP is cool, and not the most awful mistake in the history of the world.Pros:-Soundtrack (sans crappy ICP and Twiztid songs)Cons:-Disgustingly bad physics-Characters that lack creativity and depth-SSSSSSSSSlllllloooppppy combat system and controls-Lack of variety in moves-Sub-Par GraphicsThis Game is not even worth a rental fee. It is awful."
1,"Teachers should not be ""activists"".","The subtitle to this work is ""A Teacher's Guide to Activism With Young Children"". Activists do not belong in the classroom. I do not care _what_ they are advocating, the classroom is _not_ the place for social advocacy of any sort. Educate our children, do not indoctrinate them!"
1,Completely outrageous!,"You've got to be kidding me! Could this be any more Orwellian??? ""Fostering a dispositon for activism"" is one of the topics in this book. The classroom is a wholly inappropriate place to be indoctrinating young children in questionable leftist rhetoric and activism. Many parents would be agahst if they knew their children were being recruited as the next generation of protesting myrmidons."
1,Liberal Propaganda for kids!!,"Unbelievable, well actually I guess it's not unbelievable since it comes from an NEA member. Parents, if your child ever comes home from school and mentions this book make sure you can explain to them why it is incorrect, and also call the school to insist it not be used!"
1,Ann & Fran: Two more reasons to Home-School your Kids,"This book is living proof that radical Leftists try to inculcate their views into other people's children. So much for the Left's view of ""diversity.""The Blue Angels as the bad guys?Gimme a break!"
1,More evidence of the deterioration of our educational system,"An example of the author's ignorance and the questionable authenticity of the anecdotes is found in the ""Blue Angels"" story. Supposedly, the kids admonish the Angels not to bomb their library.The Blue Angels fly fighter planes, not bombers. And, the planes are not armed anyway, as they are part of an acrobatic and demonstration team.A nitpick? Perhaps. But, just as one's body temperature is an indication of one's health, such poorly-constructed stories are an indication of how our educational system has strayed from the track of education."
4,Confusing sometimes but still good,"Honestly, I liked this series. There's plenty of action, a decent amount of comedy & a splash of harem thrown in for kicks. I'm not going to go into detail about the series but I will say that I wish it was longer or had a season 2 because the ending will leave certain things unresolved & you wanting more. At least, that's how I felt about it."
5,"Wonderful book! A must read, again and again and again!","Robert Shea is one of the most talented authors. In this series, he transports you to a world that existed a long time ago and makes it live again! The characters are real and easy to fall in love with. Daoud is a man that anyone would want to know! I highly recommended this series as well as the Shike series. It is truly a shame that Mr. Shea hasn't given us more of these wonderful stories to love!"
3,part 1 only,"I enjoyed this book, but no where inside or out, until the last page, does it say it is only part one. It ends in the middle of the story - didn't even try to make a complete story out of it. I was very disappointed."
2,Not professional enough,The cartoon is a poor quality!very disappointed Thought the songs would be more common ones to help preschooler learn
1,Children's Book,This is a children's book. It is a fictional history and is not to be confused with serious baseball research. It is small and has numerous illustrations. The title is misleading.
4,Sparkling,"I always prefer the symphonic background scores over the song compliations, but this one includes an original song by Elmer Bernstein and a lot of old goodies."
1,Gardens and Landscaping,Definitely do not buy. The tool tips all came up in German! None of it worked correctly. The wizard options for getting started were very limited. It was very hard to even get a basic house plan in. Did not work to define plant/plot area. Words/headings all spelled wrong. Looked a group of 3rd graders developed this program.
2,"Adorable, but extremely difficult to get on","These shoes are absolutely adorable; however, I've never managed to get them on my infant daughter and probably never will be able to. I don't know what genius thought that having to try to manuever a tight elastic cord loop over a button was the best fastening mechanism for baby shoes, but I assure you, it isn't! They're too tight to just shove on over the foot without undoing the straps too. By all means buy them if you enjoy making babies cry!"
1,No Support for PC viruses,"Bet you didn't know that a MAC can be infected by a PC virus. Neither did I, nor did I realize upon purchasing this product that PC viruses are not supported at all. Granted a pc virus cannot damage your MAC but you can be infected and spread that virus to other people (PC USERS) in your email lists. Now on a daily basis I receive warnings that I have automatically transmitted viruses to people I have not emailed in months. Support for this problem from Symantec you ask??? Zip nada zilch! Find an alternate product. Very dissapointed and worried."
